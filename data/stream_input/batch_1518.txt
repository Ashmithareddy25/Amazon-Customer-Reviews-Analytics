0670023329|5.0|Truly an amazing book.  Once you begin reading this book you would not be able to put it down.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I am a fan of most erotica, BDSM lower on the list, but on the list none the less. Like other reviews, the first book caught my attention and I read it in one day. The annoyance of the female character was starting to nag me towards the end of the book, and I was hoping she would mature come the second book. Never happens. I think she sucks the life out of him and makes him the sub (Unconsciously). The BDSM is pretty mild and if you want to 'cut your teeth' on some BDSM, this is the book. I don't even know if I can read book 3. Anastasisa ( Please call me Ana ) is whiny, boring and indecisive and I want to hobble her 'inner goddess'.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|fun game. only downfall is there is lots of dialog to get thru.  entertaining enough. worth the investment of time.
B00275EGX8|5.0|Normally I feel this would be irrelevant but in this case I should point out I am a veteran. I should also point out many people tend to exaggerate their combat expertise and experience and just because you wore a uniform doesn't make you an expert on all things military. As I read these reviews I can't help but laugh. Sure, some movies tend to go way over the top in regards to what's realistic or even plausible but there is one caveat that all of the people who are lambasting the movie based on realism are failing to grasp. Realism doesn't sell; if I were to make a movie about the average day for an average soldier no one would watch it. So you say, what about these documentaries that do well financially following soldiers in war zones? Have you ever met anyone who ever acted one hundred percent natural and themselves when they know they are being filmed? I watched this movie and I think it was a very good, entertaining movie and that's what movies are supposed to do, ENTERTAIN. The difference between myself and some of the negative reviewers is that I'm not naive enough to watch a movie and think it is fact or that writers/directors don't take MASSIVE liberties with situations or their realistic nature; even \\"based on a true story\\" movies do this because if they were 100% fact and no fiction no one would watch because again, they would be very boring. I am smart enough to separate reality from Hollywood movie making and I don't need personal experiences to do this. For those of us that know Hollywood doesn't make realistic movies and don't think this is supposed to be a real life documentary (hello, it never billed itself as such) then I think they will thoroughly enjoy this movie. Of course if it's important for you to point out \\"they weren't wearing the right uniforms\\" then obviously you take life way, way, way too seriously to every enjoy a great movie and in that case should skip this one.
0307742997|2.0|Can a single scene ruin an entire novel? Yeah, I think so.<br /><br />[No Spoilers]<br /><br />About midway through, a scene unfolds making me roll my eyes and groan as the latest victim turns out to be unlucky klutz. There goes my sympathy. There goes my awe of the genius evil killer. And I certainly lose my respect for the author's plot.<br /><br />That's a shame. I really wanted to like this book. In the end, however, that one bad scene made a handful of other questionable scenes that much more unbelievable.
B002RHL8DC|5.0|I'm kinda saddened to see that some of the 1 star reviews are coming from people that are having problems with amazon and many reviews similar to that that have nothing to do with the show.<br /><br />Well my take is that this is stargate the way it should have been. With an estimated 80 Million $ spent on just production for starters. They certainly stretched every penny. I encourage everyone to search youtube about how SGU was produced. Its a wondering wonderful setup they had.<br /><br />I loved the show and i hope someday my kids can sit and watch it with me.<br /><br />I also feel bad that some issues of ethics have been overshadowed a bit. But we don't live in a perfect world.<br />All in all the show might not be perfect but has a TON to offer. Check it out!

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The game is good, but the constant asking for a review is annoying.  I don't know if I would pay much for it because of that.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|Awful game if it can even be considered a 'game'. No strategy, no challenge no anything at all. A totally lame premise with inane dialog which is not even relevant to the so called game. You might as well just tap on your screen all day because that is all that you do with this awful app. Not fun, not entertaining just a total waste of time and resources. This app actually deserves five negative stars. Don't bother with it.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is great. i was waiting for it to come out on the kindle since it was on my iPhone. its pretty hard to slide though but other than that I love it.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|This book was truly motivating. Mr. Hoffman did an amazing job in motivating fellow entrepreneurs and ambitious people. What was great was that he broke up the book into different segments and really focused in on the point he was driving home in each segment. Needless to say, I felt his biggest push was on networking. He emphasized this greatly throughout the book but especially in the chapters that discussed networking. He didn't fail to stress the importance of networking and speaking with other people constantly to bounce ideas and information. I have to say that after I read the book I started to utilize LinkedIn (his baby) a lot more than I have done in the past. I am very happy that I have done so.<br /><br />Of course, another central role in the book was to take charge of your career and to CREATE opportunities. The author keeps us into it with different examples of different success stories that have followed these leads and principals. It definitely helped me and I'm sure others, to open their eyes and work harder and seize more in my career. In addition, he taught me how to focus sharply while still being flexible for necessary change. He brings examples at how today's business environment is very different that the previous generations and how we need to be ready for it more than ever.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to achieve greater heights in business or any other personal project. It is a very easy and enjoyable read and I think that everybody would be able to gain something valuable from it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Fantastic read! I happened upon this book at the recommendation of a collogue; I'll admit that I was a bit leery at reading a book written for young teens. However, this was a great book! It starts off a little slow, but after the first 4 chapters everything happens so fast! The chapters are short and every one ends with a cliff hanger. EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER.... honestly it was somewhat irritating when it was 11pm and I was tired and I couldn't put the book down!<br /><br />As soon as you start reading this book, you become attached to the main character (Thomas) as you follow his journey through the maze which also represents the journey through his mind since his memories were erased. You will follow Thomas and the rest of the Gladers as they battle their way out of the maze, you yourself will become excited as the pace picks up and Thomas encounters every twist and turn that WICKED can throw at him. This is a must read for anyone (even if you are past being a pre-teen)
159514188X|1.0|...to know that I'm not the only one who thought this book was exasperating beyond measure.  A friend advised me to read it and she raved about it so I was expecting it to be beyond awesome. I finished it in one evening (it's definitely a page turner) but it just left me feeling fed up with Hannah.  I've had my own share of suicidal thoughts, etc so it's not as if I couldn't relate to the character. But I just found myself questioning the whole premise of the book. I understand that most readers found it thought provoking in regards to how our actions can so deeply affect those around us and it does cause you to examine your own actions and behavior towards others.<br /><br />That said, I think creating a very elaborate map and set of tapes for 13 people and essentially blackmailing them into listening to the tapes just reeks of a vindictive, selfish individual. Perhaps her tapes didn't affect all her listeners as deeply as they affect the narrator but, if it were me, I would be devastated and scarred for life if I received a suicide message along those lines. It's one thing to go back to people who have harmed you and say \\"Hey, you messed up and you really hurt me. Just wanted you to know\\" and to move on with your life (with the help of a good therapist in Hannah's situation) but it's another thing to say \\"Hey, here are a set of tapes that describe all the detailed slights and harms that have been done to me and you can feel horrifically guilty for the rest of your life because I'm DEAD now! So there!\\"<br /><br />Yes, some of those people did some horrible things. I'm not excusing their actions. But I also think most of those people honestly didn't know Hannah well. I have no clue what is going on in the private lives of most of the people I see every day. I think if one is living like a decent, kind individual with some awareness of those around you then that is the best you can do.  It seemed like Hannah wanted everyone to read her mind and walk on eggshells around her.  That is just absolutely impossible for all of us to do all the time (particularly the reading the mind part).<br /><br />Ultimately, suicide was Hannah's decision, no one else's.  I felt like the book was one giant pity party and an attempt on her part to blame her death on others.  It just really frustrated me.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The Scorch Trials starts exactly where Maze Runner left off, the Gladers have finally escaped the Maze and now face their next \\"Trial\\" whether they like it or not. They have lost many friends along the way (especially Thomas), and now they handful of remaining Gladers must bond together stronger than before as they face The Scorch.<br /><br />Just like James Dashner's first book in the series \\"The Maze Runner\\", this book follows the same pace. The chapters are short and every single one ends with a cliff hanger! Again, I would find myself up at 11pm and tired, knowing I have work the next day, and not being able to put down this book. (Luckily I was able to use Amazon's Cloud Reader to read at work) This book is nonstop adventure, there is so many twists and turns that WICKED throw at Thomas along his journey to the end. In this book, he will face his hardest trial.... the betrayal...<br /><br />A must read for anyone, even if you haven't read the first book of the series, you will quickly pick up on what has happened in the past and what the Gladers are going through now. I know the book is written for \\"Pre-Teens\\", but it's a great read at any age, it will defiantly bring out your inner kid.

B005LAIH54|1.0|My normal method for coercing myself to sleep when I have a headache is to watch a bad movie, then write a bad review, then hopefully be exhausted enough to drift off to dreamland.  Enter the Wrath of the Titans.  As it turned out, I didn't have to write a bad review in order to fall asleep: the movie was bad enough.  Still, some thoughts linger, mainly of how dreadful a movie it was.<br /><br />***SPOILERS, PROBABLY***<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans is one of those films which would not only have no reason to exist were it not for an astonishingly stupid decision made by the hero at the outset, but which is only kept going by a further series of stupid decisions.  Perseus is living a serene, godless existence as a fisherman.  Io (Gemma Arterton from the previous film) has died, leaving Perseus with a son, Helius, who is now a lad.  Zeus comes one evening to tell Perseus that, in the absence of human prayer, the gods' power is diminishing.  This includes the restraints Zeus placed on his father Kronos to keep him imprisoned in Tartarus.  Demons are already breaking free of the underworld to wreak havoc on mankind, but once Kronos escapes it will mean oblivion for gods and men.  Would Perseus please help?<br /><br />\\"The world may be obliterated, but I promised my wife that I'd look after my son,\\" is essentially Perseus's answer.  Consequences be damned, apparently.  Zeus smiles and vanishes.  Later that night, Perseus wakes up freaked out by a dream he had of the world ending.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Zeus meets up with his brother Hades in the underworld.  Zeus's son Ares is also there.  While both are ostensibly present to help keep Kronos in Tartarus, they trap Zeus, whose power they will actually use to free Kronos, who will allow Hades and Ares to keep their immortality.  Why the double-cross?  Well, Hades still resents Zeus for giving him dominion over the underworld, and Ares resents Zeus for preferring Perseus over himself.  Mass destruction therefore makes sense.<br /><br />Perseus changes his mind and goes on a quest with Queen Andromeda (who is even more useless than Perseus) to search for the entrance to Tartarus so he can free his father and defeat Kronos.  Along the way he runs into Hephaestus (played by Bill Nighy, who does that routine of his where he raises his eyebrow, leans forward, blinks, and then lurches back as if he's been spat on, which perhaps is meant to be visual comedy, and probably would have been had he not done it for {whats seems like} every film he's been in) who takes them to the entrance of Tartarus before he's stabbed by Ares, who is able to find them all because one of Andromeda's warriors prayed to him, even though she was quite explicitly told not to lest Ares discover her and kill her, which he does.<br /><br />Anyways, after stumbling through a frustrating rubix-cube of a maze, the gang make it to Zeus.  Perseus attempts to free him.  It's hard going at first, but once Zeus tells him to believe in himself the manacles practically fall away.  Hades has a change of heart at the last minute, putting him at odds with Ares, who's still pissed off.  By now Kronos, a giant of volcanic rock and seething magma, has broken free.  But Ares still finds time to face off with Perseus in a temple atop a mountain, making Helius, whom he has kidnapped, watch the bizarrely erotic spectacle.  Perseus prevails, taking Zeus's thunderbolt (which Ares had stolen) and combining it with Hades's and Poseidon's tridents to form a mega-weapon that he shoves down Kronos throat, bringing on a cosmic bout of acid-reflux, thus annihilating the Titan.<br /><br />Zeus, proud father of demi-god Perseus, crumbles to dust.  Hades does not crumble to dust but says his power is gone anyway.  Perseus gets over it all rather quickly, as evidenced by his putting the moves on Andromeda, who was an old flame of his after all.  It had been ambiguous when she first appeared, making for the only tension in this film.  A tension whichwas, in the end, worthless.<br /><br />It seems Warner Bros. are contemplating a third Titans film, which is strange since they needn't have bothered with this one (or the one before).

0439023521|2.0|Of course. Here we go AGAIN. At first i thought this book would be just extraordinary. It was just OK. Of course we have a girl main charector. In this case she is a cold, selfish, and depressed.It is the same plot we have seen before. We all knew Prim would be picked at the reaping. We knew Gale would be jelous of Katniss and Peeta. We knew Katniss and Peeta would win and hook up. This plot was sooo predictable. We have seen it before. Blah, blah, blah! The good parts were the ones were no one knew were coming. Like, Rue dying in front of Katniss. Wait never mind. We all knew THAT one was coming. One really shocking thing that I found out was Katniss being sooo mean. I mean come on! We all know you live were food is scarse and only one person understands you. But come on! You have a family. Before i make this any longer, i have to say the movie was very good. Just the book wasn't all it cracked up to be. Over and out :).

0345803485|1.0|Dear God what a travesty.  This is little more than B- porn.  The story line is ridiculous.... I mean I'm all for books being an escape from reality with the really well-written ones able to transport you into the story and into the shoes of at least one of the characters.  However, in this snooze fest, the story line is flat and unbelievable, the characters one-dimensional, and if I took a shot of vodka every time I read the line, \\"Holy crap,\\" I'd be wasted drunk in the first 20 pages.  Boo hiss.... glad I didn't buy the trilogy... I could have rented \\"Island of the Lost Cheerleaders\\" and bought a bag of cookies and been just as disappointed.
0345803493|5.0|Good Book. My wife really enjoys reading these books. She read the trilogy in a weekend.  She gave them to her sister to read now.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|Received my processor yesterday (1 day before expected 2 day delivery, thanks Amazon.com and UPS), processor is FAST, WEI=7.6 not 7.9 but darn near close enough.  Had no problems within the first 24 hours, but then after rebooting the cpu fan would not work, it would try to spin, but then fail, then try again, and fail, it might would turn around 2 or 3 times then just shake like it was trying to get a jump start at spinning up...  I tried a different fan plug, would not run, I tried a different fan and it worked, so it was not the motherboard, it was the fan.  I tried turning on the PC and timing it just right so that when the fan would try to run i could flick it with my finger to jump start it, and this didn't work.  I spent a good 30 minutes trying to get the fan to spin, but to no avail. I'm sorry but I'm a loyal Intel fan, however I'm starting to have my doubts on their \\"quality and consistency\\"  First off I work for a tech company that does Point of Sale systems for thousands of restaurants.  In a year I probably install several hundred new pc's to new and existing businesses. We mostly sell Dell PCs which can be special ordered w/ this exact processor.  I cracked open a dell case and sure enough EVEN DELL doesn't use Intel's stock fan, they use the heat sink but not the fan.  And while we are on the subject of heat sink, what happened to these things? I custom built a 755 socket a few years ago and the stock intel heat sink was HUGE.  It had a lot of copper and the fan ran great.  What I got stuck with was a heat sink that was 1/3rd the size of what I was expecting and a fan that would not run!  Sorry it is just a peeve for me that I spent $230 bucks on a CPU and this was the kind of quality I was provided with.  I know the cost of materials has gone up, but I would of gladly paid $5, $10, even $20 better for a better stock heat sink and fan.  I'll upload some pics in a little bit to show everyone how redic this pathetic heat sink and fan was.  I ended up cutting off the fan but leaving the main part of the plastic that attaches to the heat sink because that plastic also holds it to the motherboard.  I had to have this PC up and running today so after I ended up cutting off the old fan, I had to zip tie a new 80mm fan to the heat sink because of course this thing is so small there was no way i was going to be able to get more than one screw into this thing to hold a fan in place.  But word of warning, if you are going with this processor, go ahead and order you a better heat sink and fan.  Don't get me wrong the processor works great and its fast and it uses a fraction of power compared to Sandy Bridge, but the heat sink and fan has got to go... FYI, once I zip tied a new fan to the heat sink and put the CPU under about 50% load the temp peaked at about 98F/37C, but the fan was running at full blast... 5 star processor, 0 star heat sink / fan... so I'm docking a star.tting off the fan but leaving the main part of the plastic that attaches to the heat sink because that plastic also holds it to the motherboard.

B007SGM084|5.0|so, yes, there is a lot of sex in these books, but what a great story!  I had a hard time putting it down.  I just kept wondering what would happen next!
B0064MT1SA|5.0|I had a feeling that this would be an exceptional BLU RAY reissue and I'm glad to be proven right.<br /><br />The picture quality is uniformly gorgeous and highlights the vivid array of expertly researched detail the 150-strong production company filled every scene with - Mexican clothing, terracotta interiors, chaotic art studios and colonial South American buildings. Its default aspect is 1.78:1 - so it fills the entire screen without stretching or loss of clarity. You combine this with a sympathetically-written script, brilliant acting and a genuinely affecting and unfolding story (never mind the huge amount of EXTRAS transferred in full from the DVD - see list below) and the whole experience is a joy to re-watch and re-discover.<br /><br />The first thing that strikes you about the print is that 'colour' is everywhere. It opens in Mexico in 1922 when Frida Kahlo is a precocious 15 year-old and able-bodied (before her horrific accident) and over the course of the movie progresses nearly 30 years hence - so lighting - textures - interiors - all have to be matched. The Blues, Reds, Yellows and Gold are full on and evoke a Mexico of the period (all beautifully done by Production Designer Felipe Fernandez - Oscar nominated for his work here).<br /><br />The autobiographical nature of her art is captured in cleverly woven-in scenes and her painful injuries/nightmares are portrayed at times by grotesque animation peopled from her canvas creations. Frida suffered back pain all her life (an iron rod skewered her abdomen and uterus in the accident) and famously painted lying down with a mirror over her bed (she later had toes and a leg amputated due to her injuries). Yet she defied all expectations and after two years in casts managed to walk again. Taymor's movie fills the screen with this - her spirit, her driving need to matter and her bisexual lovelife and gender-bender dress sense. This is a world where politics and passion are seething in the streets - and boozy nights are spent discussing the first and engaging in the second...<br /><br />The cast is large and seriously talented - and Frida is a role Salma Hayek openly admits she'd always wanted to play. The worst you could say about her performance is that her beauty and astonishing sensuality sometimes hinder believability. But she gives her all and her supporting cast are so well chosen that her film-star looks get quickly forgotten. Given the depth and difficulty of the part - her nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role is richly deserved.<br /><br />And while Ashley Judd (her dialogue discussing their marriage titles this review), Geoffrey Rush, Edward Norton, Antonio Banderas, and Roger Rees all contribute their vignettes with heart and commitment - the film's real ace-in-the-hole is ALFRED MOLINA. He is simply astonishing as Diego Rivera - the Mexican murals painter who married Frida in 1929 at the age of 43 when she was only 22. Diego was a fat ugly man who became her mentor, lover and on/off husband for 25 years. Loveable one minute, loathsome the next - the film is so much better because he's in it (Salma sings his praises in the extras). A lecher, habitual womanizer and a serious-minded Communist - it's a ludicrously difficult part to nail - yet Molina is never anything less than brilliant. Charming at first when he's getting what he wants (wooing Frida in the alley outside his studio) - then to his wandering glassy eyes as infidelity creeps to the surface (watching her sing at a party, but eyeing the other women there) - he later crosses the line completely by sleeping with her sister (fathered a child by her too). The big question is - why did a woman as smart and as committed to loyalty as Frida - countenance this boor for even a second? Friends gave their union 'two months' - her own mother described their marriage as being between \\"...an elephant and a dolphin...\\" The answer the film tells us is LOVE.<br /><br />In interviews, Director Julie Taymor states that both she and Salma returned to Frida's diaries and found they were not about betrayal and men-as-pigs (as many feminists feel) - they were all about Diego and her. Frida really loved him - admired him - supported him. Of course she wanted to slit his throat on several occasions - and was ultimately broken by him (the scene where she cuts her hair is particularly powerful) - but she seemed to stick with his first wife's advice and accept the rough with the smooth because the overall gain was worth it (\\"...He's the best of friends and the worst of husbands.\\"). It's an odd relationship in an oddball world. Yet both Hayek and Molina are so believable that when the film morphs from one of her paintings of the married couple standing in a room into the actors playing them - it's hard to tell the difference. Taymor (who devoted almost two years of her life to the project) does well to rescue Frida from self-pity and loathing - showing instead her courage and joie-de-vive - her fierce loyalty no matter what. Her partner Elliot Goldenthal also provided the film with a beautifully apt Latin guitar score (for which he won the Oscar).<br /><br />To sum up - it was never going to be an easy task to film the life of this icon of Mexican art (Frida) and interpret her tumultuous lifelong relationship with another free soul (Diego) - yet both June Taymor and Salma Hayek pulled it off admirably. It was nominated for six Oscars and won two - Best Make Up and Best Original Music. You can't help but think it should have won more (especially for its two leads)...<br /><br />A quality BLU RAY reissue then - and like a good political knees-up with Leon Trotsky - wholeheartedly recommended.<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />VIDEO: 1.78:1 Aspect Ratio [Full Screen]<br />AUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English, English for the Deaf and Hard-Of-Hearing, Spanish<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />1.

Of course she wanted to slit his throat on several occasions - and was ultimately broken by him (the scene where she cuts her hair is particularly powerful) - but she seemed to stick with his first wife's advice and accept the rough with the smooth because the overall gain was worth it (\\"...He's the best of friends and the worst of husbands.\\"). It's an odd relationship in an oddball world. Yet both Hayek and Molina are so believable that when the film morphs from one of her paintings of the married couple standing in a room into the actors playing them - it's hard to tell the difference. Taymor (who devoted almost two years of her life to the project) does well to rescue Frida from self-pity and loathing - showing instead her courage and joie-de-vive - her fierce loyalty no matter what. Her partner Elliot Goldenthal also provided the film with a beautifully apt Latin guitar score (for which he won the Oscar).<br /><br />To sum up - it was never going to be an easy task to film the life of this icon of Mexican art (Frida) and interpret her tumultuous lifelong relationship with another free soul (Diego) - yet both June Taymor and Salma Hayek pulled it off admirably. It was nominated for six Oscars and won two - Best Make Up and Best Original Music. You can't help but think it should have won more (especially for its two leads)...<br /><br />A quality BLU RAY reissue then - and like a good political knees-up with Leon Trotsky - wholeheartedly recommended.<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />VIDEO: 1.78:1 Aspect Ratio [Full Screen]<br />AUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English, English for the Deaf and Hard-Of-Hearing, Spanish<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />1.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is awesome! I had a hard time putting it down and finished the entire series in one short weekend! I highly recommend it!!
B008B3H4VQ|1.0|After listening to their new single, i was a tad bit hopeful, even thought their last cd sucked. This album, unfortunately, also sucks. Sigh.
B004QL7K70|5.0|Simply put, this is a party movie, and it does an amazing job at it.  If you are looking for a rich story, deep scenes, or even a plot your in the wrong place.  If you are looking for something fun to start the party mood up, this is what you are looking for.
B004H4XLRE|1.0|I ordered this toy for my 4 year old son as part of his birthday present. Imagine the disappointment when it stopped working the day after. I don't expect very high quality of these types of car toys, but 2nd day!!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|the story is not very interesting but the gameplay is good and the graphics are well done. definitely doesn't have replayability.
B0087240Z4|3.0|I have listened to this album from start to finish about sixteen times now. This was not done because I love the album.it was done because i'm trying to search for any glimmer, any speck of the magic present in other smashing pumpkins offerings. What I find, however; is a collection of songs that simply are. By that I mean they simply exist. None of these songs are likely to be anyone's anthem, not likely to change a life or illicit an acute emotional response. They are simply and inoffensively sitting stagnant. This is your grandfathers smashing pumpkins.
B005Z4LCZS|4.0|Takenoko is a fun, lightweight strategy game.  Due to the influence of the die, their is too much luck involved for the hardcore strategy gamer. But for somebody looking for a short game, that involves some strategic planning - and a 'panda' - then this game might be for you.  Another win for Antoine Bauza the designer - who has already made two very playable games (7 Wonders, and Ghost Stories).
B0011N1WE8|2.0|I thought this movie sounded like just my kind of thing, but sadly I found myself very let down by it.  The characters failed to really be all that interesting, the slap-stick comedy (people jumping out of windows) was just a bit too silly(and not funny) and I kept finding myself thinking that Penelope wasn't really all that ugly.  It seemed a bit over-exaggerated that people were jumping out of a window at the mere sight of her - she wasn't that horrible to look at.  The movie earned a few points for me with its ending--which didn't end how I had expected it to---but I must say that overall, this was forgettable and I wouldn't want to bother watching it again.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Saw the film twice even the review I read it says its a little slow to get started-from what I can this movie rocked from the start and it was great from the word go
B006SHVIWS|3.0|I can't say enough positive things about season one of Downton Abbey.  It was heartfelt, wonderful, delightful, entertaining, moving, exciting, funny, and most of all, intelligent.<br /><br />I'd heard some fans say that season two of Downton Abbey fell short a bit compared to the first season, but I hoped that perhaps I'd be amongst the fans that loved the second series as much as the first.<br /><br />At first, things were not looking good.  I found the first episode of season two felt a little rushed, and I was dissapointed that more time wasn't given to developing and introducing certain story arcs.  Episode two still felt a bit bumpy, but things were getting better.  Episode three felt back on form, and my husband and I watched on up until episode 6 with much delight.<br /><br />Then things began to fall apart.  It's difficult to say much without giving away spoilers, but the appearance of a mysterious wounded (and disfigured) solider who claims to have ties to the family was only the first of many utterly absurd plot-lines that I found myself utterly unimpressed by.  Episode seven, in particular, was so bad that it started to get funny.  My husband and I could not help but laugh as we pounded are fists and shouted at the characters \\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?\\"  There were some ridiculous plot-lines, many cases of characters acting out of character, and some really poor writing.<br /><br />The final episode did not have the effect on us that it might have had had it not come on the back of such a load of idiocy.  At least they spent the episode resolving some of that nonsense, so that hopefully they can make way for new (and better) story lines in season three.<br /><br />To fans new to this series, I'd honestly recommend you stick with season one and pretend that season two doesn't exist.  Season 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey can be brought separately - although you will save money buying them together in this box set - and I suggest you do just that and give this box set a miss.  I know I certainly don't want to ever subject myself to season two again, although I'll be more than happy to re-watch season one.  With season three on the way, however, it's still a bit too early to say whether this show has \\"jumped the shark\\" already, or whether season three can redeem itself and bring the show back to life.  I certainly hope it does, though I can't help feeling that Downton Abbey was not a series that was meant to run for many series'.<br /><br />Just a quick note as well, this set does not include the Christmas episode, which deals with events immediately after season two.  I've no idea why this is being sold as the \\"complete\\" collection, when it certainly is not.  The Christmas episode must be purchased separately, and is rather disgustingly priced for what it is.  I fail to understand why the Christmas episode was not included on this box set.set a miss.

B005LAIGNC|4.0|I know that it was fictional history and the story was marginally at best in the ballpark. But what I did appreciate is the Tuskegee Airmen were remembered and honored. Some of the same issues many of you have expressed with the movie I felt also, such as the outlandish sole combat maneuvers that would never have been tolerated as well as the use of technology that did not even exist back them. But there were the things that did happen, the support of Eleanor Roosevelt, the discrimination at the officers club, and the many combat victories won due to their support and valor. So I hope others will take from this rendition the honor and recognition given to the Tuskegee airmen.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is AWESOME! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I play it every day 22/7! for some reason my Pandora plays i just wanna run when I posy a level lol &lt;[^_^]&gt;I only need two characters until I have every one!
0345803485|1.0|I found this story very 'vanilla'. The Mr. Grey character was laughable in his unbelievability. And if such a person could exist by some stretch of the imagination, why would he EVER be interested in silly Ana? In any event, I found the writing dull, and the sex scenes were ridiculous. After the first one, I began skipping just to get to the plot, which wore thin under the weight of 'fifty shades of f**ked up'. I find it humorous that some were very shocked and offended at the subject matter...*yawn*
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I started to read this book and was immediately turned off by the fact that the main love interest is a smoker. UGH! Why would any writer who is writing a book about teenage romance make the main character a smoker? The other thing I didn't like about this book is that all these characters are underage and drinking like it's no big deal. Not a very responsible image to portray the heroine and hero of this book for teenager readers. Aside from the fact that the main guy does do a fight club to earn money, instead of getting a job, I also found the fact that the main love interest goes around beating up other kids to bloody pulps, in the school cafeteria, without any consequences by school administrators. So to recap this book is promoting underage drinking, smoking, and violence in a school setting. Have yet to finish the boook, but can't imagine it gets any better.
B002SJIO4A|3.0|District 9 was filmed using a handheld camera for the documentary part of the movie, which works, giving an authentic feel to the interview sequences. Then it switches to traditional filming. Pay close attention to the documentary section; otherwise, questions such as \\"why didn't the aliens...?\\" will distract from enjoying the movie. Also, keep in mind, that this movie was made on a low budget.<br /><br />PLOT - MAY BE CONSIDERED SPOILERS:<br /><br />  The aliens of a stranded spaceship struggle to live among humans as they search for a way to go home. Native Earthlings, realizing the aliens have nowhere else to go, place them on a reservation called District 9. The Earthlings then repeat history by making irrational assumptions to uphold racist beliefs and justify their poor treatment of the newcomers.<br /><br />  The film stops just short of making a grand political statement and allows some humor to offset the tone just enough to keep it entertaining. It also contains  squeamish and violent bloody scenes.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The book was pretty decent, but I didn't find it to be as great as most other people seem to have.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with the book was that it could have used more editing. There are frequently long stretches where the plot moves very slowly - many paragraphs used when few would more then suffice. The book could have been shortened by at least 100 pages without anything substantial being lost, and I frequently found myself skimming or skipping tons of filler paragraphs to get to the next relevant point.<br /><br />The second issue I had was with the characters. Between the late introduction of important characters and the killing off of others the development of the characters wasn't as strong as I would have liked, and I found myself not really caring about any of them.<br /><br />The part that I really liked was the world-building/setting. Yes, the post-apocalyptic society has been done before, but the author has an interesting approach to it and goes into more depth then you usually see. He does a very good job of describing the setting and making it interesting. There is definitely potential for continuing this series and exploring more of this world.<br /><br />So, overall I though it was OK (3 stars by Amazon's definition) and I will keep an eye out for future works by this author.<br /><br />Bottom line: should you buy this book? The price point ($5.99 for my Kindle version) is low enough that if you are interested in science fiction, post-apocalyptic futures or dystopian settings then yes, but place it around the middle of your priority list of books to read.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|It has been awhile since I have written a review of Linkin Park since their previous record \\"A Thousand Suns\\". At that time, it seem that LP was trying to push the boundaries of music to a point of an art form and trying to force the music rather than letting it come naturally. Although the record debut a No. 1 of Billboard it soon fell quickly from the charts because of its lack of depth to the album. Now, in 2012, and the band returns once again with \\"Living Things\\". Now, I have been a huge LP fan since 1998 and have seen their evolution over a course of a decade blending all genres together and I want to recap everything up to this review for those that may be new to their work.<br /><br />From Hybrid Theory to Meteora, they exploded on the scene with ferocity and genre-bending sounds that no one in the \\"Nu-Metal\\" could compete against back in the early 2000s. By 2005, after their success with Jay Z on \\"Collision Course\\", the group wanted to explore and shake the criticism from critics and others alike and placing them in a label that the group collectively didn't want. So, by 2006, they recruited legendary producer Rick Rubin to executive produce the groups third album \\"Minutes to Midnight\\". It was a drastically departure of their recent sounds; Mike Shinoda took a back seat on the project and produce more on the record rather than having his signature rapping on the record (with the exception of \\"Bleed It Out\\" and \\"Hands Held High\\") and push Chester Bennington and rest of the band in the forefront. The album became so controversial that it divided the fan base in half 'til this very day. After the change of the direction of the album the group decided that they wanted to keep pushing the foundation of their work the group follow it up with \\"A Thousand Suns\\" and many people felt that Linkin Park would never get back to their old form. That is, until now....<br /><br />\\"Living Things\\" is a blend of the past along with the continuous exploration of music. Each track seems to have the feel of each of their current work in their catelog being represented to their fans at almost like giving back to the hardcore fan whom have follow them for so long. However there are some slip ups in the record which doesn't make the record perfect:<br /><br />1. Lost in the Echo - 4/5: This is a definite throwback to the days of Meteora. Displaying that Mike Shinoda hasn't lost his touch of rapping after the past two albums. Chester lends a rough and rugged growl to the track along with great production. A great way to start off the album.<br /><br />2. In My Remains - 4/5: Has a great rock sound and Chester brings his signature sound to the track. Mike comes in the bridge with a chant \\"Like an army, forming, one-by-one-by-one\\". Not too bad of a track to follow.<br /><br />3. Burn It Down -4/5: The lead single of the album. It is fitting how Chester started out with the line \\"The Cycle Repeated\\". It almost seems fitting to the thesis of this album. Great production from Mike & Mr. Hahn, almost has that House, Dubstep approach to it. Mike does lend some rapping to the bridge of the song. Overall, has the feel of an older song \\"Blackbirds\\". But, nevertheless, a good record.<br /><br />4. Lies, Greed, Misery - 4/5: This track seems to be the most interesting song of the album. Almost a Fort Minor feel to it as Mike takes control rapping on the track while Chester does the hooks. Pretty good if you have a sound system in your car or on your computer. Still a pretty good track and a possible second single to it.<br /><br />5. Ill Be Gone - 3/5: This is where the record seems to take a course of more and almost melodic side of the group. Not as heavy as previous tracks but still holds good to lyrical prowess. It felt like it needed more substance to the record but this track I really don't seem to care for.<br /><br />6. Castle of Glass - 3/5: I do honestly like this track for the lyrical theme to it. The problem is that Mike Shinoda trying to singon the track. It doesn't fit and throws me off each time I listen to the track. If Chester would have been the person singing on this track I would love it a bit more.<br /><br />7. Victimized - 2/5: The reason I rank this down is the length of the track (1:46). The track is so short and barely has an affect to give like the other tracks on the album. Although, it is great to hear the band as a whole sing the opening chant before Chester growls out the title track. Mike brings in a good rap before the track abruptly ends. Needed to be drawn out a bit more to have an effect.<br /><br />8. Roads Untraveled - 3/5: Similar to the track \\"Castle of Glass\\": good production, almost that bluesy-rock ballad style to the track. The problem: Mike Shinoda singing. His singing is not good for the track and drives me insane even though I do love the message that is brought to the track. Again, Chester needs to dominate the track; it would have been interesting to hear a soulful side of Chester and display that he has various ranges of singing rather than people hearing him scream and growl on many tracks.<br /><br />9. Skin to Bone - 1/5: This is the least favorite track on the album. Each time I try to get myself to listen to the track I just cannot get through it. It doesn't seem to fit on the record. Mike, once again, dominates trying to sing on the track and just doesn't make it a strong feeling to the record. Chester follows in background vocals and the hook but I felt that the production doesn't work along with the selection of who sings and who backs up. I usually skip it.<br /><br />10. Until It Breaks - 4/5: The record picks back up with more of a  funky Hip Hop blend with Mike returning to rapping in what I felt was his best rapping on a Linkin Park record in awhile. Sure, the production felt a bit out of place but it was forgivable. Chester brings in to the bridge and gives a break of the monotony. Then, in surprise, Brad Delson (guitarist) lends his vocals to end the record (this marks the first time that Brad was actually singing vocally on a record).<br /><br />11. Tinfoil - 5/5: OMG, for those that love Hybrid Theory & Meteora they remember certain tracks that were dedicated to Mr. Hahn production breakdown. Well, its back! Although short in length, it is refreshing to hear the breakdown.<br /><br />12. Powerless - 4/5: The album ends off with a pretty good track that Chester shows a good strong rock ballad. Production is good and holds up for Chester and flows thoroughly throughout the track.<br /><br />Overall, the album is a lot better than the previous two albums. For those that harp over them not recreating the days of Hybrid Theory and Meteora, this is as close as everyone is going to get to those albums. But, its great for them to combine their previous work and still trying to push the foundations of music. Although, I still feel that places like Mike trying to sing needs to be cut down or ended completely, allowing him to rap a bit more and produce more and leave those tracks to Chester or even Brad. Yet, production seems to be all over the place and tracks seem to not flow through seamlessly like older albums. But, it is a start in the right direction for the group. For the hardcore LP fans, pick up this album and give it a shot. For those new to LP, have a listen to tracks like \\"Burn It Down\\" and \\"Lies, Greed, Misery\\".
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have several photo apps on my Rezound and think this may be my new favorite. Loads of filters, frames, and edits. Good controls on crop took and others.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. now I notice a lot of reviews saying u have to restart ur kindle. that isn't true all u have to do is go to stuff and then ur arrow will pop up so u can go home.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|When I first noticed this book on the best selling area on my kindle I was intrigued and therefore bought the sample. After the reading the sample looking at a few reviews and hearing from countless sources that this book was amazing I craved and bought the book and I have regretted it ever since. The plot is boring and the charcaters are nothingmore than a reincarnation of Edward and Bella. This book is no where near deserving of the hype it has recieved. Expecialy at this price do not waist your money!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Nice looking application. It's clean, simple, easy to use, and it's got many cool effects. Very satisfied with it. Thanks!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Entertaining and well-made game. Works great on my Samsung Fascinate. Great graphics too. My only, minor gripe would be the lack of instructions for some of the mini-games, but they were easy enough to figure out. Also has good replay value. Def would recommend this one!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Whatever your opinion of Rush, understand this. This album is a monumental achievement in music history. It's the masterpiece that Rush has threatened to release since 2112. That the clock on the cover reads 21:12 in military time is not just a cute little trick. Look deeper and you realize that it's a bridge back to the album where they first complained of the priests control over everyone. The red cover evokes \\"Hold Your Fire\\" and the excellent \\"Time Stand Still\\" which is all about the passing of time and getting older; I don't think I need to say any more about that. If you delve deeper, you will find many more connections...I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />Let me close with this. I don't know what's harder to accept; the thought that Rush could ever outdo this amazing record, or the idea that they will never try. In the meantime, do yourself a favor, take the time to understand and visit the clockwork universe.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very addictive once you figure it out. I like it as much as regular solitaire. A must have for any kind of waiting you have to do!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I was thinking this controller since it was fulfilled by Amazon would have been a genuine Sony product. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Package arrived fast (only good thing about this transaction), however once I opened it, I could tell immediately it was a bootleg. For all potential buyers look for these factors:<br /><br />1) color of controller should be listed on box (this wasn't)<br />2) the model number on the box should match the model number on the controller ( mine didn't)<br />3) check the quality of the controller as well as the label. The FCC must regulate electronics, this controller did not have a lot of info on the label printed on the back.<br /><br />I have been a long time amazon buyer and I can honestly say this event may be enough to prevent me from buying on here again. Bad business all around. Like the title says, when did amazon become as legitimate as a back alley flea market.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive its so fun to play but I had problems getting out of it. But I figured it out.You go to STUFF and tap options and then the thing will come up and your out of the game! All these bad reveiws on you have to pay real money are weird because every game wants you to buy things with real money to support the game. I think this game is fun and cute YOU SHOULD GET IT!!!!!
B005OGS5BG|4.0|Great picture and loved the movie.  I'm not into richness and snobs but like the characters.  LIked them showing the shallow characters narrow mindedness.  Any movie that makes me smile and feel good at the end is a 4 star for me.

0345803485|1.0|I wrote a blog post that conveys my feelings about this book (below).  Oh, and Ana, URINATE AFTER INTERCOURSE.  You too, Christian.<br /><br />Normally, I don't follow the crowd.  I don't have to see the latest blockbuster in theaters when it comes out at midnight on a school night.  I don't wait in line for hours to pick up the latest gadget.  I don't read books like Twilight or Lord of the Rings.  I don't watch primetime TV.  I'm not sure why this is the case, I guess I just like blaze my own trail.  Anyway, when Facebook became inundated with posts about the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, I was indifferent.  That was until I read reasons why people weren't reading it, then I became intrigued.  I also read that hardware stores were having trouble keeping rope on the shelf, which I really don't understand because the characters never even used it.  I picked up my handy Kindle Fire and went to the book store.  Then I found they wanted $9.99 for one book.  Um.  No.  Fortunately, I have a friend who is even more resourceful than I am and she sent me the whole series.  I set to work to see what all the hype was about.<br /><br />First, the good (sort of).  It kept me interested at first but it seemed to follow the law of diminishing returns.  The more I read, the less interested I became.  The author tried to come off as a sesquipedalian (aka user of big words) and I think my vocabulary expanded slightly.  It was almost as though she overused her thesaurus and underused it at the same time.  Anyway, this is supposed to be the good.  The book was about BDSM, which is very obviously why so many understimulated housewives are enjoying it.  They have an inner freak similar to Ana's inner goddess. Some of the sex scenes she described were entertaining, but they lost their spunk a few hundred pages into the book.  The romance was thick.  I can see how people would like to read about handsome billionaires lavishing an ordinary mortal with houses in Aspen, condos in New York, Audis, diamonds, expensive vacations, and Christian Louboutins.  I get it.<br /><br />The bad.  There was absolutely no plot.  It kind of felt like I was just reading Ana's blog.  The author has got to be laughing about this all the way to the bank.  James does throw in a few good sub-plots that kept me turning the pages like the time the ex-submissive Leila held a gun to Ana and the time Ana's ex-boss Hyde demanded ransom for Christian's sister.  The problem?  It only lasted a couple of pages and the solution was entirely predictable.  As for a climax (insofar as stories go), there was no major climax in any book.  It was just a flat storyline.  Not only that, the story wasn't even believable.  Their romance blossomed at a freakishly quick pace.  She needed her ass whooped, and not by him, for moving so quickly with a man.<br /><br />More bad.  The redunancy was so annoying.  Ana and Christian were constantly fighting and having makeup sex.  GAG ME (metaphorically speaking).  Not only was the story repetitive, but James used the same five sentences to rehash the same story lines OVER AND OVER.  The book was on repeat.  I never had trouble turning off my Kindle to go to bed at night.  To me, that is the measure of a good read...whether you can't put the thing down at night.  I could.  Her prose was terrible.  I've seen autistic monkeys with better communication skills.  I was more distracted by that than anything else.  She also had a hard time with writing in the first person.  We never knew Christian quite like we knew Ana.  The ways she told us about him was through emails (FOR REAL).  She also made us read the dominant/submissive contract TWO agonizing times to give us a glimpse into his world.  At the end, when she realized she had written something totally unbelievable into the story (Ana withdrawing five million bucks for ransom) she just wrote a separate chapter that described a phone conversation Christian had with the banker.  Really?  Lame.  Then at the end she tells the story of Ana and Christian meeting (again), but this time from Christian's POV.  After spending hundreds of pages making the reader want to like Christian, she finishes by making him look like a complete douchebag.d she tells the story of Ana and Christian meeting (again), but this time from Christian's POV.

0307951529|5.0|One important aspect of starting your own business is that it can be difficult to find people and companies to model for your version of success.  Trying to act like a big company, or even a VC-backed startup may be the wrong move for someone trying to build a life-style/freedom business.<br /><br />This book provides good practical advise to get started, focus on the customer, charge for the value, and design your business for freedom.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This has the to be the best thing I've read in a long time; absolutely addicting and impossible to put down.  If I have any complaints it is that I ran out of books too soon.  Keep up the good work and keep adding to this series!!!
B0053KWDES|5.0|I bought some Sennheiser HD 650s a year ago. I hardly use them because neither my iPhone or iPad can power them. WIth this little amp and a cord coming out of the line out doc, they sound fantastic. Crystal clear, loud bass, and now I can use my high end headphone with my iPad when I read! Awesome...and FWIT, I don't like most audio products...this is a huge improvement on the apple stereo out.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Where's the update for kindle fire? My friends who already have the update cant get there points because I haven't been updated yet.....hello!?

B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Fun, but it freezes up in the find the difference game. Have to restart. Tried again, same thing. Really disappointed because I was really enjoying the game.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This is a mystical metaphysical journey through the purification of a soul.  At the beginning the main character holds a gun in his mouth because the pain from his lost love is unbearable.  Isn't that the worst pain for most of us, lost love? Some try to drown it out with substance abuse, anger, hatred and other forms of avoidance. Who suffers such loss head on? Only the strongest parts of our soul can endure this, our love, and our charity turned outwards.  John manifests this attribute when he listens to the call from the wilderness, the howl representing the void in his soul that needs to be filled with meaning.  His existential journey begins as he merges both his masculine and feminine parts of his soul.  He both protects and nurtures. Although his job is one of a sniper who protects others by shooting wolves he begins the collections of wallets, representing the collection of souls by this human Michael the Arc angel. Obviously, these demons pursuing this man have met their match.  Throughout the movie John who leaves his alter suicidal personality at the log, turns his back on the head demon, (see his claw mark on his back of the guy left at the log).  John is on the Journey Saint John of the Cross describes in his book Dark Night of the Soul.  He asked each dyeing person to hold on to images of Love (which is God's presence in the world).  The guy at the log, (also John) does not have a memory of love (Knowledge/dogma) and makes his at his last mindful moment when he shakes John's and the other man's hand.  The main character the human Michael the Arc Angel takes us on his journey, one of faith, hope and charity not dogmatic bible thumping lunacy. Knowledge is abandoned in exchange for faith and hope. He is the symbol of humility before God; he is the prince who stands up for his people, the great protector and the leader of the army of God against the forces of evil.  Regardless of your beliefs we all have our demons to face and the movie states \\"take courage through love\\".
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|omg I just love this game. fast playing speed( no leg) and high quality graphic and a good story line.

0142420891|5.0|It's only 8:30 but seeing as I've been bawling for the last hour and a half, I think I'll just go to bed and mull over Adam and Mia and all of the life they've struggled through and the truths that have spilled over into mine.<br /><br />This book (these books, actually) have secured firm spots on my list of honest, true, devastating, beautiful reads.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game something to do while u r bored so if ur waiting at docs office this is the game
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this game is really really cool. i recommend it to a lot of people. if u believe in ghosts this is the perfect game for u.
1781161097|5.0|I found this art book to be one of the better ones.  There is a lot of pictures and art.  Very nice quality.  But there is also a lot of text to explain the ideas behind the design of the movie.  Not so much on how they make it but more on the thought process behind the ideas of the movie.  This helps because the movie was so vague in some areas.  I recommend it for anyone that likes the movie and these types of books.
B00884GR0W|5.0|After demoing this game for a while, I've decided to buy it. This is an excellent mining/ building game, and I'm positive that it will continue to wow me with each update. Thank you dev, I love Block Story. My only complaint right now is that Ted is really dorky, looks out of place, and he takes me out of the game.
B003YCI1O8|5.0|Tremors is a movie that I grew up watching since it came out. I can remember renting it a lot as a kid and owning it on VHS (the VHS copy I bought was horrible and never really played well).<br /><br />Tremors stars Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Michael Gross, Reba McIntire, and Finn Carter (who interestingly enough, is not only from my state but grew up in the same city I lived in for a few years as a kid). In a Nevada desert resides a tiny town called Perfection which is geographically isolated due to mountains on one side of the town. At the start, Earl and Val (Ward and Bacon respectively) are two handymen looking to finally get out of town for greener pastures but not before they meet seismologist student Rhonda. Unfortunately for the duo, just as they decide to leave town for good, never-before-seen large creatures appear besieging the citizens of Perfection and trap them there seemingly without any chance of escape. These worm-like creatures reside under the ground and hunt by vibration.<br /><br />One of the things I think I love about Tremors that the sequels failed to (or just plain were unable to) capture--though the fourth movie at least tried--was the sense of isolationism the characters felt and the seemingly inability to know how to handle the creatures. These are monsters no one has ever seen but apparently have lived underground for centuries and yet, because of their location, no help would come until it was too late....if ever. I loved the sense of \\"what do we do?\\" the movie had going on.<br /><br />I think this is one of those movies that could have somewhat easily fallen into \\"cheesy and bad acting\\" territory. On the good side, this didn't happen. All the acting was pretty good as was the writing.<br /><br />The picture quality for the blu-ray was good. Not many complaints there. However, I do have one. At the end of the movie, the last two scenes were almost jarring. The second to last scene was fine but then the very last shot, the drop in quality compared to the rest of the movie was pretty noticeable to me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't believe people are giving this bad reviews. I absolutely love the game. It is addictive. Honestly, it deserves more than it has... and it has a fair amount of stars. I remember the good old days when it had all of the stars it clearly deserves... when only smart people bought the game.... before mindless children bought it, loved it, then got bored of it and gave it critical (read absolutely ridiculous) reviews. Great app... love it! Go Imangi!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I'm not really the type to watch any kind of shows on TV, but my wife made me watch this and it's really good.<br />Really intense especially at the end of the season.<br />Definitely a must watch. Watching season 2 already!
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|I'm glad I got this as the free game today, or I'd be asking for my money back. It took over an hour to download because it kept starting over, then wouldn't install the first time. Once it finally installed, I tried to open it only to get an immediate force close message. I've never had that problem with any other app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|some people said this game was stupid.WELL ACTUALLY PLAY IT THEN! It is a great game for all ages. Once you start playing it it becomes really fun. I think everybody loves a challenge!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this a little too much. I'm hoping that the movie trailers everybody is talking about are a thing of the past.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this game sucks. I played it for five minutes and got bored. If you get this game you are wasting you time and memory on your device.
030758836X|4.0|Oh holy cow! I am so not a suspense novel person, I don't like to be scared and I cover my eyes in movies all the time. Something about this book intrigued me and I loved every minute of it. Nick as a character gave me all I ever need in a book, I loved and hated him, I sympathized with him and wanted to strangle him. the only flaw I found in his part of the book was his sister. her character felt flat as a pancake to me. I would have liked to see a male friend by his side through this story!<br /><br />As we learned about the life of Amy I spent time imagining how I'd handle life in her shoes, would I make the same choices? what in her life lead her to be this way? One of the most profound pieces I took from this is a bit of fear of sharing my kids and their lives online. I mean Amy's parents were Authors who wrote a series of kids books about her life...It may have just cautioned me a bit!!<br />If you pick up any kind of a suspenseful book this year, make sure it is Gone Girl!
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|For the $4.99 I spent, it does not disappoint. This album is refreshing after the letdown of A Thousand Suns(And most music nowadays), but I would rank it as okay along with Minutes to Midnight and a bit far from reaching the legendary status of Hybrid Theory and Meteora. I'm a newer fan, but I can definitely understand how earlier fans can be disappointed. However, I support their decision to move on to a new elctro-pop-rock style that this album brings, while trying to capture elements from previous albums.<br />As a whole I would rate the album, Myself: 3.5-4 stars, Long Time Fans: 2.5-3 stars<br /><br />Favorite Songs: Castle of Glass, Powerless, Lost in the Echo
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love this puzzle game. its the best i have downloaded yet. i wouldnt delete it for no other game...ever ever ever
B0066W1AZK|4.0|THIS IS THE FIRST GAME I PUT ON MY KINDLE FIRE.  IT IS A STRAIGHT FORWARD, EASY TO USE, and highly adjustable chess game.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the game pieces and board are graphically boring and not adjustable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is great. I use it everywhere. it includes different versions and even audio.<br />the interface is easy to use too.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Much more fun than the original I played in gradeschool - early 80's. My kids are playing &amp; loving it now too.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|really enjoying this game challenging but fun. only thought I have on the game is I wish the hints symbol was easier to find. thank you G5 for a great game
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|LOVE this movie!  Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to watch something besides your typical mainstream movie! Both Brad Pitt & Edward Norton are amazing actors. :D
0316134082|5.0|Breaking Dawn was my favorite book from the Twilight series, but I love all of them. I was never a reader before starting this series...now I have a Kindle and reading is a new passion for me. I just want to say THANK YOU to Stephenie Meyer for  writing an AMAZING series that helped me realize how amazing reading a good book truly is!!!
B005P39GOI|5.0|I am a relatively new listener and fan of Ben Howard.  I discovered him at Bonnaroo, became enchanted watching various youtube postings, and was blown away when I finally downloaded his album Every Kingdom.  He is exceptionally talented, and has become a staple on my mp3 player.  I can't remember when I have enjoyed music so much! His guitar skills are exceptional.  I hope to see him DC when he plays at the 930 club in September. Can't wait!
B0086700CM|5.0|I luv this app so much!!! Its so amazing n cool!!! Its also addictive......very addictive!!! I so recommend this app to anyone. :)
030758836X|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. When I started reading I thought \\"what the heck is this book going to be about\\" then the more I kept reading the more it became a book that I could not put down. It was truly an exciting, well plotted, twisted, mind bending, story. A book that would make Hitchcock proud. As far as all the reviews about the ending...not to worry. I thought the ending was pure perfection,and as one other reviewer said she thought the last paragraph of the book was \\"brilliant\\" and I have to agree. It summed up the whole twisted mind of that character. Brilliant, simply brilliant.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|right now I hate it because it wont open!!!!! please fix this so I can play on my kindle, thanks.
B00633W614|5.0|The famous quote comes from the bible. This is novel about a man who is trying to escape his own life and believes that assuming the life of another will help him. The irony is that this turns out to be far worse and with no way of being able to prove he is not who he said he was. The trouble begins.
0805209999|5.0|On Trial is Josef K. a respected banker in an unnamed city. He faces charges that are never explained to him and about which he gains little information. He vainly tries to mount a defense, much to the detriment of his work, using the few resources available to him and his family. Along the way he alienates some who might further help him and ultimately ends up trying to fight the charges alone. The trial coupled with his work exhaust Josef K. and by the end of the book does not protest his final sentence. Throughout the novel the reader comes to the conclusion that the trial itself is not for any specific thing Josef K. has done but rather his fitness a human being. In essence he is on trial for how well he may be able to mount a defense. When first faced with the charges Josef K. is defiant and confident of acquittal but over a period of time he comes to accept his fate. This is well illustrated in the climax of the novel in which Kafka presents a parable to explain Josef K.'s situation. Kafka thoroughly convinces the reader of exactly what they have to fear.<br /><br />I want to stress there are many ways to interpret this book. Whether as a commentary on justice or an existentialist parable Kafka has much to offer the reader. I would implore anyone who is considering reading Kafka to pick up this novel it is well worth a read.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The story of two young people whom meet eachother in college and bet to see who will fall for the other faster. This is a story that has been told, but the writer uses great technique to tell it in a different way. This is a leisure read for those of us who jjust need something to take our minds off everything else.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|well they told me to make a review in the beginning of the game so its good so far I love hidden object games!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a lil frustrating at first not what u expect but after a few passes through you will get the hang and have fun. be sure to go for higher scores for better rewards
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I don't have time for a long, in depth song by song review because I need to go listen to LIVING THINGS again, but here's my comments.<br /><br />As with each of the previous 4 Linkin Park albums, this continues to prove that LP is the worlds best band. I don't say this lightly as I'm a big fan of music and many genre's and many artists.  Linkin Park is what I would consider \\"state of the art\\" if one were to describe music in the way that the latest tech products are described. If you want to hear the newest sounds that human evolution has arrived at, just buy LP's latest album.<br /><br />I'm a Linkin Park fan who has loved each new direction they've taken. I love Hybrid Theory and A Thousand Suns at the same level, and everything in between.  I'm surprised at how many comment on how they only love the first two albums.  Hey, that's fine if you only like one thing, but let's not bash a band which enjoys evolving. Change is good.  Likewise, I read reviews for artists that do stay the same and they get bashed for recycling the same recipe.  Artists can never win with some people.  I'm actually surprised that this album has been described by some (including LP themselves and pro reviews) as being a return to their roots.  For the most part it isn't.  It can best be described as being 50% influenced by the previous 4 albums combined and 50% all new sound - a natural place to have arrived.<br /><br />Another comment I'd like to make is in response to most people calling this album short.  Yes, it is, mainly because we yearn for more after 37 minutes pass, but it's well within the average album length.  And do we forget that Hybrid Theory and Meteora were SHORTER? Yup.  And oddly enough, the folks that said A Thousand Suns wasn't a complete album must've missed the fact that it's by far the longest run time in their collection.  But yes, I feel LP could have included 2 more songs on this album.  We all know they have the material. Or simply have lengthened some of the songs that seem to be cut off to soon.<br /><br />In closing, I'll say that if the other best albums of the decade are a \\"10\\", then this is a \\"12\\".  Linkin Park plays on another level.  A group that is way, way underrated and ignored by many who think they are a fad from 2000. They don't realize what they're missing. This group is the past, present, and future.<br /><br />Thanks LINKIN PARK!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cool game don't have 2 ask people 4 a lot don't have to have a ton of neighbors to get your stuff
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I like the old heavy/nu-metal/hip hop Linkin Park, but this album is fair enough for every lp fan i guess. This album is a mix between all of their 4 albums. The songs structure is based on LP old style (i.e. rap/little screams from chester/rap/bridge...etc) and also mixed with some old heavy tools they played in the past with some noisy electronic-computer sounds (That's what i hate from the new lp). Overal, my rating for LP albums goes like this:<br /><br />1.Metoera<br />2.Hybrid Theory<br />3.Living Things<br />4 & 5 ... doesn't matter.<br /><br />P.S<br /><br />I'm not the kind of guy that only listens to 2 or 3 songs for LP and then judges and complain about their style ... NO<br />I'm a big fan who likes their old style :)
0345803485|5.0|I love the book and read the whole series in less then a week. Love the Author and way of connecting through her writing style and humor!
0345803485|3.0|This book is good but not great.  It lacks a true plot.  It is erotic but that is it.  The upside of the book is that you don't want to put it down because you are waiting for the climax of the story or literally.  I will read the other 2 in hopes that it has some substance.
B0034G4P4O|2.0|I was amazed by the animation. However, early on, I found some of the characters and/or their actions annoying. Astoundingly, the action sequences are boring -- not exciting -- with too much happening for no particular point. I never felt involved in the story or really cared. Tintin has promise as a character as well as Snowy, the dog. I ran the second half of the movie at 1.5x speed and felt even at that that the movie was too long for what it contained. A thin -- though visually stunning -- gruel, indeed. There's a kernel of a movie in there somewhere. Too bad two of the most famous directors in the world couldn't find it.
0143039431|5.0|Perfect item, I have to read this book for class in the fall and I think it's a decent thing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its not the best game ive played. the credits are annoying and the prices are outrageous. but in all its an ok game.
B0017VG69U|4.0|The content of the DVDs is great. Star Trek is a great series. We all know that. If you weren't a Star Trek fan, you wouldn't own this or the other two seasons. I'm still a little torn over the Remastered episodes. The new CGI effects look really nice, but I personally find the transition back and forth between 60s soundstage effects and modern CGI effects mildly disruptive. It's Star Trek though, so I'll get over it.<br /><br />The packaging of the three seasons is IMO a little less desirable. The outer box looks nice, but the clam shell opening with the hinge at the bottom is just kind of awkward. I think it might have been better if the hinge was on the side and the case opened more like a book.<br /><br />Inside, each disk comes on it's own plastic tray. The trays are made from that brittle polycarbonate type plastic and feels like it's going to break or crack each time you try to take a disk out. Each of the seasons I have has at least one tray that had a chipped or cracked tray (but no plastic pieces in the box) that I discovered upon opening. Something that didn't feel quite as brittle or breakable, or having them packaged book style rather than individual trays would have been nicer.<br /><br />DVD content - 5/5<br />Packaging - 3/5
B0059XTV4Y|1.0|THIS IS EXACTLY THE MOVIE JOHN WATERS WOULD HAVE MADE...ONLY WITH A CAST OF D LISTERS AND A SENSE OF TIMING. MADONNA SHOULD BE BANNED FROM USING A CAMERA. OR FROM BEING IN FRONT OF ONE. EVERY SHOT IS BADLY FRAMED AND THE STORY IS A MESS. TO ALL OF YOU THAT REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE, LET ME SUGGEST \\"ISHTAR\\", \\"HEAVEN'S GATE\\", AND THREE CLASSIC MADONNA \\"FILMS\\", \\"WHO'S THAT GIRL?\\", \\"SWEPT AWAY\\", AND THE JAW-DROPPINGLY BAD \\"SHANGHAI SURPRISE\\". HAVE FUN.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I've tried a lot of Sudoku games, so I didn't have much hope this would be any better than the rest, but I was WRONG!  This one is EXCEPTIONAL!  It really is the best I've ever played!<br /><br />I've never seen the variety of Sudoku games which are available in this one.  And the paper marks which can be turned on instantly (saving TONS of work on your part -- not to mention eliminating the chance for error) make it easy to play a quick game at the easy levels and let you jump straight into the deduction and elimination stages on the harder levels.<br /><br />And there's another big perk...the variety of levels and their increasing difficulty is PERFECTLY done!<br /><br />I have this one on the Home screen of both my phone and my Samsung tablet...and its not going to leave any time soon!<br /><br />If I had to come up with one small gripe, its that the Main Menu could be a little more detailed.  But that's being really picky on a fantastic version of the game.<br /><br />UPDATED THIS REVIEW ON 6/29 AS MY (MINOR) GRIPE ABOUT NOT HAVING MULTIPLE SAVE GAMES IS UNFOUNDED.  A multiple save game feature is indeed there.
0061450162|3.0|Make no mistake, I very much appreciate and admire Neil Gaiman. I was delighted when \\"The Graveyard Book\\" won the Newbery. \\"Neverwhere\\", \\"Coraline\\", \\"Stardust\\" - all marvelous. And Gaiman has written some fabulous short stories. Some of them appear in this book. But only some of them, and those that are included are surrounded by stories that aren't very special and aren't particularly satisfying.<br /><br />  Every reviewer has a favorite in the book. Some like \\"Snow, Glass, Apples\\"; some like \\"The Goldfish Pool...\\" or \\"Troll Bridge\\". I'm partial to \\"Chivalry\\". But there is a lot of fill here. Many of the best stories have appeared elsewhere. Also an overlong introduction and a rather indulgent piece that reads like a collection of blog entries on each story tend to dampen one's enthusiasm.<br /><br />  For what it's worth, some of the best stories, (\\"Troll Bridge\\", \\"Chivalry\\", etc.), were reprinted ten years after this book was released in the collection titled \\"M is For Magic\\". That book, also available on Amazon, has a much better selection than this one does, so if you can only swing one Gaiman short story collection, you might want to consider that.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|made me rate it 5stars but I do like it. it was hard to get used to at first but hasn't disappointed me
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I'll start by saying that if at this point you're still expecting Hybrid Theory and Meteora it should be obvious that the band isn't going back to that. This album is amazing, every single song sounds unique and yet they all belong together to create one of Linkin Park's best albums so far. Somehow it just sounds like they dedicated a lot more time to each song than the previous album and keeps showing growth, something that not every band can achieve. Do yourself a favor and listen to this masterful album for what it is and you won't regret it.

I read some freezing reviews mostly from older \\"DVD\\" sets but figured blu ray wasn't going to freeze! I'm using my Ps3 though I don't know if this is the problem.. It froze on Aliens on the rescue mission then tried playing it on directers cut and it froze on the same part, it can't be the ps3 right?  I'm really hoping I got a bad set, because the movie/video quality in part one was great, part 2 was ok but not great, overall great set it just sucked that mines froze in the middle of part two and I cant do anything about it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|There are some nice features in this Solitaire app. I especially like the winning hand option when you don't have the brain power to lose a game.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|This movie was far worse than the first movie which I thought was pretty good - not great - but, pretty good.  In this version, they decided to go more comic book style (think old Batman series \\"boom, bam, pow\\" scenes) action where some sequences blacked out when the real action was supposed to be taking place and you got this animated effect on live characters. Just a whole bunch of really stupid scenes poorly shot and edited.  Overall, the acting was poor, the writing was poor, and the cinematic direction was crappy. \\"WARNING\\" spoiler:  There is a part of the movie when a barely audible/understandable Elba tells Nick Cage that getting rid of the rider is going to be painful and then locks Nick in this cave... where like nothing happens and then he's cured! WTF? Seriously... NOTHING happens except more blackout.  Did he even scream? I don't even remember.  Please pass on this one. Seriously not worth the money.

0307719774|5.0|I got this as a gift for my birthday and i love it. I think the questions are interesting and it will be fun to see how i have and havnt changed in the next 5 years. Some people say its too small and there is not enough space. I however think the size is perfect if you travel and easy to hold. I write very big and i do have to smush my writing to fit but its really not a big deal. yes the binding was very tight as first but after a while the binding loosens. This is such a cool gift!
0971830509|5.0|I first learned about this book after researching what inspired the horror master himself, H.P. Lovecraft. This book is really interesting to me because it contains well written short stories, but not only that but Robert Chambers was one of the first authors to deal with the idea of what the future could be like. His stories take place about 25 years ahead of when he himself is alive. This makes him pretty fundamental reading to anyone taking a serious interest in science fiction or horror literature.

B008CP93S0|3.0|Rented for wife as expected chic-flic. It was ok. Funny at times for sure but then also serious, not funny at all at times. Do not see the need for all the 4 letter words (proof it is an adult movie??)And surprise with full frontal male nudity however brief it was. Guess film guidelines are changing. Predictable but that ok. Recommend? Not sure.
B0086700CM|5.0|Okay, really? I don't know what's up with those one star reviews, because Temple Run is a very fun game. It's entertaining because you create quick skills as you run, jump and duck to escape the monkey demons chasing as the reaction times get shorter. Excellent to pass the time, and it provides upgrades in order to get more coins and points so it is easier to stay alive. But there are also goals during each run yo have to meet. Several of which I'm still attempting to make.
B005ISQ7JM|4.0|This book literally cost me nothing thanks to prime, and it was a good jumpstart into HTML5.  It doesn't go very deep in the book, but provides links to articles that start you in the right direction.  Definitely a good starting point for anyone.  Now if you are wanting something deep and actually wanting code examples you should look elsewhere.  It is a very short read though and a good starting point for someone just beginning to look at HTML5.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is so awesome! I love drawing stuff for my friends. You should get this really get this app!!!
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|A very good movie. It has some very funny spots spread throughout the movie. It's a little vulgar so if you are not into that sort of thing you may want to skip this. I haven't like a single Channing Tatum movie until this one.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Having lived and worked in advertising throughout the '60s, I find the program to be well researched and well written.  I rank it head and shoulders above other series on TV.  I look forward to Season 6.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|awesome game. one of the best free games ive played on the kindle fire. If you want a great free game this is the one to get
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was browsing sci fi books on my kindle and stumbled upon this book, all these 5 star reviews and a 5.99 price point? Sign me up.<br /><br />And boy was I NOT let down. This book made me cry, it made me want to get up and run, leave everything I am and just GO. It's just great story telling.<br />It had its low points, but for the most part this book kept me guessing. That's whats missing in<br />a lot of books and movies, tv shows. Balls. Writers dont seem to get that to instill true fear, and suspense, they have to be willing to go All the way.<br />Once you make your audience know that you will actually do it, they respect you and fear you. And that creates true suspense. Not only is he willing to<br />go all the way, he actually creates characters you care about, that you feel like you know. By connecting us to them with simple experiences, things everyone has felt and known<br />we bond with them. And the guessing game of the silo and all its going ons, Wow. This book has it all. I am recommending it to anyone, not just sci fi readers.<br /><br />Its late, and im tired, but i had to write a review after finishing this book. I just wish i could write out my feelings as well as he can write books maybe this review would be worth something!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is a great book, one of the best I've read on death and dying. Helps to create a sense of hope and removes thoughts of self blame when one's health takes a turn towards terminal. Also appreciated her insights on religion and the afterlife. Religions create division and discord making no difference in the end since we all emanate from One Source. In agreement with Rev. Carlton Pearson  who lost his pentecostal church following for espousing the same philosophy:we all will go to heaven.[[ASIN:1416547932 The Gospel of Inclusion: Reaching Beyond Religious Fundamentalism to the True Love of God and Self]]
B0086700CM|5.0|very simple and addicting game.. I can spend hours playing it without realizing how long its been.. easy enough for kids to play and waste some time..
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Waste of time and money, I think the other reviews covered all the negatives pretty well. Wish I had read them first. I will have to say the repetitiveness was a unique torture. And I feel truly sorry for the author who based on her stories of \\"hot\\" sex has likely never even had decent sex. In fact I would believe it if I was told she never had sex at all, since she would learn quickly that virgins do not give the best BJs unless perhaps they have been a lifelong bulemic, kwim. There is nothing kinky in the book and it ends with the heroine running crying, and dumping the guy the first time he gives her a good spanking. The prose could've been and likely was written by a teenager. This should definately be in the YA category, I'm sure I would've thought it was awesome when I was 16.
B002UZXJA6|1.0|I would not recommend this CD at all.  I love Celtic music and various CD's by Celtic Thunder, Celtic Women and the Dubliners.  This CD starts out pretty nice, but soon the music becomes boring and not an enjoyable listen.  Her voice is nice, but not \\"amazing\\".  So...hearing song after song after song that begins to sound just like the prior song, I found myself wishing for a little variety. It just does not compare to the other celtic cd's I have.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like the game.  the only thing I don't like is you have to play with friends. I am not a facebook member.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Beautiful pictures and so much variety! I was so happy when it finally became available for android devices. There are tons of free collections to choose from.
B004SBX112|5.0|Under the water is just like space. You go in the water and out. Pretty hard at first but you'll get the hang of it.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|i was given a list of books over the summer to read for my summer reading requirement. I love to read, so when i saw the hunger games on the list i was very excited because i had heard from people at school that the book was very interesting. But when i got the book i was dissapointed to find the book was extremely boring. i was having a hard time staying awake while reading it. the book is about the united states in the future. the states have separated into disticts. the main character, katniss lives in district twelve. every year there is a competition called the hunger games. twenty-four contestants are picked randomly. one boy and one girl from each district are picked. the people who are picked are called tributes and each of the twenty four tributes must compete in a massive free for all deathmatch(if you have played call of duty you know what i am talking about). thegames do not end until all but one tribute has been killed. the winner will gain fame, fortune, and best of all, live to say that they survived the hunger games. believe me this book may sound interesting to you now, but i gurantee you will not like this book. the only action that happens comes at the last twenty five pages of the book. that is all i have to say about the hunger games. this is u want the truth signing out. be sure to check out my other reviews that will be coming soon.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game works fine! it's get better keep track of your stats. It might be that your kindle isn't working riht! I love this tame!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is on of the best Baldacci has written recently.  Great story line; good character development - makes you care about the characters and what happens to them.  This is a \\"can't put it down\\" book, so once you start reading, plan on staying up late!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is the Best!.Why don't you make a new 101games in 1 but insted make it 102 games in one
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Disclaimer: I got thru about 20% of this book and couldn't read the rest.<br /><br />1.) the 'inner goddess' references get annoying fast<br />2.) the main female character says 'holy crap' entirely too much and acts surprised over everything<br />3.) this book is 99% erotica/BSDM and about 1% story<br /><br />Being a reader who is not and never has been, a fan of BSDM, this book highly bothered me. It made me angry and nauseous. I'm not putting down anyone who enjoys this kind of read/lifestyle. It's just not for me. I'd rather have an actual story to read rather than \\"hello I'm ___, lets have sex\\" (insert inner goddess line here). The book isn't well written either. Not in the least. I fail to see the hype.<br /><br />If you want an actual story, don't care for BSDM and erotica and want characters of substance then pass on this book/series.
B0086700CM|4.0|I could not stop playing this game it was very obsessive. And great for when your bored and need something to do.
B0082209TK|5.0|'Bel Ami' portrays the rich and famous, what money can buy for the elite, and how lives are lived on social scales as it describes people in Business and how their money is used to their own preference. Acting Performance is Good as unique, colorful characters light up the screen. Interesting and Entertaining from start to finish. Highly Recommended!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|A Brilliant presentation with a different but dramatic story as Batman faces many problems. The mood is dark and dismal when Batman is taken on a special mission to fight crime that has gotten out of control as a city is about to Fall. Acting is Excellent, the images are Superb as they blend with the gloomy mood and fear of total destruction. Good story, entertaining from start to finish as it grabs your attention in the very beginning. Highly Recommended!
0307592731|2.0|The book overall was a good read although some themes are repeated over and over - wrong size boots and over loaded pack.<br />The part about the murder of her mother's beloved horse turned me totally off.  I did not read those paragraphs word for word because I love animals and what she did was criminal - no excuses.  She knew her mother had loved the animal?  You turn Heaven and Earth to make it humane.  That part of her story did NOT need to be in the book, in my opinion
B00785P2QC|4.0|I have loved playing this game and have spent a lot of time playing it! The Facebook aspect does not bother me at all because I do not have to bother my friends in order to get things. I am frustrated at how slow it takes to earn the investor bucks.  I have way more money than I need but no investor bucks. I do not have extra money to spend for a virtual game. So I will either be patient or have to give up. I hope I do not have to give up!
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|i got a $10 gift card and used it on this, but after i opened it, it said I needed to free up about 1200 MB of storage ... after deleting all of my music and pictures on my kindle it still said I needed to free up about 400 MB to play it. Don't be fooled, I thought it would fit but it didn't. One more thing screw you gameloft.
030758836X|5.0|I do not remember the last time I read something so gripping, entertaining, clever and funny at the same time. It is a much better version of reality TV, creative, witty, incredibly built story. Thanks to EW magazine for pointing this author and book to me.
0345803507|5.0|I felt compelled to read this book after all the hype and coffee talk. I went into it worrying it would be too graphic in BDSM. Yes, there are many, many, many detailed sex scenes - but it was more sex and emotions, not the level of BDSM I had feared - so don't let that scare you off. It was not at all what I expected - and now I see what all the hype is about.<br /><br />I was glued to the books in this series and literally could not put them down. I read all 3 in less than 3 days - finding myself up until 4 am because I could not wait to see what happened next. Yes, there are graphic sex scenes - many of them - but at its heart, this was a love story. I was entranced by the love story, laughed, and even found myself crying during parts of the books. I cannot think of any other book or movie which described the depth of love that the characters had (especially Christian's love for Ana) so well. The books/story was addictive - I had to see what happened next - my heart wrenched at different points for both characters.<br /><br />As the other reviews have mentioned, the author could have been a little more creative in describing characters actions/feelings - too many references to \\"shades of,\\" Christian tilting his head, and the characters turning up their lips (among other things). That being said - although it was mildly annoying, I was so enthralled in the story I could have cared less at the time.<br /><br />I LOVED the last section of book 3, which was told through Christian's point of view (of the begining of the first book). After reading all 3 books, I would have happily continued with 3 more all from Christian's point of view. I was longing for more. I sincerely hope the author was using that as a teaser, and that she will be publishing 3 more books written from Christian's perspective. Trust me - they WILL SELL!<br /><br />I've seen comments about actors/actresses to play characters in the movie. My suggestions: Christian - Channing Tatum (after all, Christian needs to look drop dead gorgeous shirtless), Ana - Scarlett Johannsen (she has the lips for it), and Mrs . R - Sharon Stone - I've heard suggestions of Angelina Jolie, but she is way too young. Mrs. R is supposed to be Grace's friend/contemorary - so she should be in her 50's (not late 30's). I am worried that the books will be shortchanged in a movie. Sex, and graphic details of sex acts are a major part of the story - I am not sure how they could be true to the book and still get an R rating.<br /><br />I am off to go reread all 3 books again... Yes, they are that good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|such a good game! difficult getting acorns but superfun! I would definately suuggest this game :) just don't buy the stuff that you have to pay for in the game. there is a distinct difference!
B0054YH8DY|5.0|This is a great album. I think it is one of their best.  I was glad to find it on CD.  The CD is a faithful reproduction of the original vinyl album, which I have.  The CD also has a previously unreleased version of \\"Old Friends\\".
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I received my copy of Law Abiding Citizen today and I must say I'm very impressed with the disc overall. I've seen the movie before and just wanted my own copy, hard copy. The movie itself is enough to make the suckers fly off the shelf, but its hard to find such a bargain price, a steal really. They were true to their word with this product and beyond because when I opened my package it was better than if I had went to the media store and bought a spanking brand new copy. Thanks capcityoutlet.
B007X4HPIG|5.0|3rd album from Brooklyn band--Raging, dark noise-covered melodies, where a sugar-coated<br />  pop-hook core lies bubbling in the belly of dance-crazed demons rockin' on razor blades.<br />  An attack-mode experiment mixing melody with the outer limits of ear-screeching volume.<br />  Powerful, invigorating, happy head-ripping music.  A place where explosive electronics and<br />  white-hot guitar turbulence mate in a maelstrom of inspired & addictive hypno-terror rock.  A<br />  fiercely massive magic missile for the body & brain.  Like Jesus & Mary Chain on steroids. Or<br />  D.A.F. whacked out on whiskey.  Or Weekend, Suicide & Serena Maneesh jamming together in a<br />  bad mood.  Or Beach Boys meet Joy Division in the meth lab.  Seriously.  Easily the best thing<br />  APTBS has ever recorded and a stand-out moment for music in 2012.  Dangerously brilliant!
0385738773|1.0|**Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />The first thing that strikes me as completely ridiculous about this book is Tom's constant refusal to think and just be driven by a \\"gut\\" feeling or whim. He says so himself plenty of times throughout the book: he evades recovering his memory -which I can understand if it had more sustenance- just because he is afraid of himself, he avoids Brenda when she's about to tell him some important news just because he doesn't want to know anything (what kind of main character do we have here?), in a scene he just says he'll do what feels right leaving everything to whims which highlights the author's lack of plot.<br /><br />The author seems to switch between trying to teach us how important the greater good is and the individual rights of men. At both he fails since he provides no plot to guide us through a story of just event after event describing a world that I don't care about because it does not become relevant to any story line.<br /><br />He resurrects characters with no motive, kills off main characters to try to replicate a dramatic moment which is lost due to lack of character development and conflict, a combination that produces conflict for the sake of conflict.<br /><br />I won't try to guess what the author wants me to take away from his story since he seems to not know it himself. The ending is an scapegoat with no meaning and, again, with random events that happen at not so random places to provide intensity, but falls too short by not tying up loose ends and finishing up with a deus ex machina.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Mind boggling at times, never a dull page. Mystery, Hidden Objects and fun all in one game. Look forward to trying more games by G5.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app! It helps me communicate with my friends you I see a lot and my friends you I don't see as often. I like the comment idea.  but if I had one problem.....which I do.... it would be that everyone who I play have iPhones or iPads so I would like to get the update it looks so cool and silk.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|clear and fun with a story line. I love hidden object's games so this is perfect for me.<br /> thank you.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|so I ko ko ko ko ko mono ko mo ko mo lo lil ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko ko
0062082353|5.0|Highly recommended. One review was critical of the way it was written, he's a SEAL who told his story not a literary major who writes fiction. I thought is was very well done. I liked how his wife added to the book, it puts his personal life in perspective better than just his interpitation of her thoughts. He gives just enough detail to put you there (as best as anyone could) without loosing you in getting too deep.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i luv this app. everyone should get it. really fun because it has levels so you can always have challenges. I LOVE IT
0307951529|5.0|This book is hard to put down. It contains so much useful information such as check lists to use when you're thinking about starting a business or launching a new product.<br /><br />The ideas provided are useful right away. This isn't some business theory book. It's built on the wisdom of several small business owners. The stories are interesting and help you to see the human side of business.<br /><br />It contains practical \\"here's what worked and what didn't\\" stories from multiple start-up businesses. It's always better to learn from somebody else's mistakes rather than you're own so this book will get you down the road faster.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Well personally i like some romance in films especially in a super hero movie and felt that in this perspective it was lacking. Its obvious she liked Thor from the beginning but he didn't really show any sign of liking her (including the hand kissing, its a mid evil tradition it doesn't count). Then suddenly near the end of the movie she kisses him and suddenly loves her to a point where he would do anything in his power to be reunited with her. It was a poor romance film in my opinion.<br />Secondly I really don't see why the Jotuns couldn't have been destroyed he gave up his love for a bunch of giant blue guys who's life's joy is to see Odin (Thor's father)slayed.<br />In truth it took me a couple times of watching the film to realize many of the plot's details. Such as Lafi's son is Loki (missed that part)etc.<br />Lastly, personally I feel after Thor's exile and when the hammer was once again his it was stronger (probably becasuse Thor was worthy bla bla bla.<br />Overall a good movie wonderful graphics, exciting plot that will keep you stunned (like when Loki kills the king of the frost giants, Lafi) I enjoyed myself and hope you buy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like having so many games in one to choose from. it is great that you get to unlock many more. My family is very competitive so we are always trying to beat each others score.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very cool game, totally worth playing. I'm glad I stumbled across it. the concept makes me laugh, adding to the enjoyment
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!!!! I was unhappy when the kindle did not have this game but since they finally have it I play on it where ever whenever. I want. I give this game two thumbs up!! get this game.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|I have had this airsoft rig for about a month. And so far it has not failed me. I attached a Condor hydration pack on the back and a small utilities back below that. The only bad thing about this chest rig is that it Doesent come with a dump pouch so you might want to get one when you bye it. It fit all 6 of my m4 mags perfectly, and it has room on the right side for a pistol holster and 6 mag holders for the pistol are attached to the vest. U can't get the m4 touches off because they are sown to the rig but that's ok. Oh ya and also I am only 5 feet 2 inches and I adjusted it to fit me perfectly. This is a great rig and I would recommend this rig for anybody.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Gray is very easy to read and just when I thought I wasn't going to buy the second book of the trilogy, I found myself buying it the same night and reading it. I couldn't put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My Book Club was anxious to review the 50 Shades Trilogy.  Only a couple gals in our club own Kindle Fires so the rest were searching for paper copies (you know, like from the Cave Man days?).  Anyway, I downloaded books one and two on my Kindle Fire and I was reading in less than 4 minutes!!<br /><br />Love it!!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|First let me just say that you have to read the book to know why I used \\"crappy doodles\\" in my title.  :)  Second, I loved this book! I was lucky enough to get it for free (a while ago) but liked it so much I wouldn't have minded paying (within reason of course :).  It was well written, had good editing and left me wanting more, more, more.  I look forward to reading the next book in this series from the author.<br /><br />As a side note . . . I'm a reader who stays away from the free religious themed books on Amazon.  In case anyone is curious this book does not include messages of faith and/or religion.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The only reason that I even gave this book a two star instead of one is because Grey's missed up childhood and Mrs.Robinson were about the only interesting few pages of this book. Yes I said few pages because 90 percent of this book is nothing but scenes of Ana and Grey more times than bunnies in heat! I found myself desperately trying to find interesting parts to read, an actual story. I like a nice sexual scene as much as the next person but even I have to admit that his was way to much! It was like reading a script to a porno film.  And if this book ever turns into a film, it would be rated XXX because the whole film would be nothing but sex sex sex sex every other word. the character Ana is completely controlled by the sex, so much so that she can't even make any actual decision on anything else. over all Im just disappointed and it could take all day for me to list how many ways I am disappointed. So lets just leave it at that. Extreme Disappointment
B004GYNPL2|5.0|This app works great,does what it says it does helps me alot i have so many user names and passwords and i can keep track of the with easy...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids and I enjoy playing this together! I do wish there was a way to block buying stuff with real money so my kids could play without me watching. but it is cute and the movies are great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW!!  This was an awesome, erotic, and addictive trilogy! I don't read books, EVER, but I'm so glad I gave into the hype because it was so worth it. I went through the first two books in one week total, but I slowed down on the third one to preserve the story as long as I could. This was such a FIVE STAR purchase.  Maybe it was repetetive and maybe it wasn't the best writing but when you have stories like these, I personally don't care how it is written.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This album is awesome.  If it were only out before I last saw them on tour... I will see them again now that this is out.
0062060554|2.0|I got this book through the Amazon Vine program, and the blurb looked really good. Unfortunately, the plot moved so slowly that I fell asleep every time I tried to read it. I somehow managed to connect with the heroine, Christine, about 3/4 of the way through the book and really only because I'm nosy and I needed to know what happened to her and why her \\"memories\\" weren't reliable, and why she lost it to begin with. I figured out what was going on with Ben before the book was over, which kind of irritated me because once I figured it out, I really just wanted the book to be over. I don't see this ever having a sequel, so the fact that the author left the book the way he did really irritated me. Yes, she's safe, but does she have her memory (mostly) back? Will she wake up tomorrow and know what happened? Or was everything she went through for naught and she's still stuck in that terrible black hole? Sorry, but I don't like books with ambiguous endings like that. I either need an HEA or a finalized \\"everyone dies, the world sucks\\" kind of ending (which, to be fair, I don't like either, but at least it provides CLOSURE!)<br /><br />Overall - it was a hugely disappointing read. 2 out of 5.<br />Originally reviewed for MamaKitty Reviews.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Great behind the scenes story about a true Formula One legend. You get to know the human side of Ayrton, not just the maniacal perfectionist hell bent on crushing all competitors, no matter the cost for himself or others. A true classic and a must have for even casual fans of F1.
B002RSDW80|1.0|I don't want to waste much time on this, I just want to add that Child was someone who didn't give a damn about the suffering of others, as long as she could get some pleasure for herself out of their pain. If that's not the definition of a sadist, I don't know what is. The \\"others\\" I'm talking about are of course the animals, whose corpses she used as the main ingredient in what she defined as food. Even if she had been a vegan cook, I still would've found that silly voice and arrogant stage presence a source of extreme annoyance. Child-lovers, how can you make a celebrity out of someone so obviously selfish and cynical? Maybe you see yourself in her...
B005LAIHR2|5.0|You don't have to be from that that era to Enjoy this delightful presentation of fun with 'Good Music.' The cast are worth the viewing, Sound Effects are Awesome and one that many would find Totally Entertaining. Worth the wait and the price. Highly Recommended!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Very well done and its power caught me by surprise. There is so much good in animals (dogs) and we can learn a great deal from them.
034580404X|5.0|*Wife of Christian Z*: These are great books. I would recommend everyone to read them; (Mature audience only) A pager turner through and through. A good story line with some very erotic scenes. You will fall in love with Christian and Ana's story. They have it all: the heroine (Ana) brave, smart, and innocent young female, male lead (Christian)a wealthy,good looking, and kinky business man, the character you love to hate (Elena) ruthless, every preconceived notion one may have of a modern day \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", car chases, sabotage, fires, accidents, true friendships, and warming regards to playful \\"relations\\" with a partner. You will be shocked, laugh, and cry while reading these books.
B005BCE7II|1.0|The static scenes show good depth and 3D effect, but when anything on the screen moves it takes on a silvery sheen and becomes almost impossible to focus on.  This was fine for my 5 year old, but a terrible experience for me.  None of our other 3D Blu-rays exhibit this defect, and no amount of fiddling with settings on the HDTV or on the Blu-ray player was able to improve the experience.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading the trilogy books this one was my FAVORITE!!! It gave you just the right amount of everything in one book. I would recommend Fifty Shades of Grey to anyone who is looking for a good juicy love story with crazy twists in between.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love this app...easy to use.  can access from Internet or my kindle. can make lists can copy and paste docs..its wonderful!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is one of the best apps out there. The coolest part is the gravity. The burrs are also updated so its nicer.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this game is awesome. The only thing I don't like is that the game expects you to post everything on Facebook.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book because I'm a pretty curious person and after so much fuss with Fifty Shades of Grey and all the controversy I had to see for myself. I was pleasantly surprised to absolutely love this book. The chemistry between Ana and Christian is pretty powerful and well... what can I say? Grey makes me sigh dreamily in spite of all of his kinky sexual preferences. Christian has a very strong and compelling personality that you can't help but love. Ana is on the shy side, but somehow she manages to deal with Christian; not an easy feat. Yes, there are a lot of very explicit and kinky scenes in this book but there is so much more to them and for that I loved this book! And okay the kinky scenes were pretty awesome, too ;)<br />I loved Christian's intensity and his mood swings made for an interesting roller-coaster. Simply put: HE IS HOT.<br />The eye rolling, EEEP! There are some pretty steamy scenes and I'll admit that there were also a few scenes that made me squeal like a little girl in excitement! I loved it and I laughed out loud various times and I cried and I just AHH! I'm noy usually into all this BDSM crap but I loved this book nonetheless. I honestly recommend it to everyone!

0545323126|5.0|My 8-yr old daughter bought these with her own money. She's been reading them for two weeks and can't get enough! She saved a lot of money buying them in a set. They are very entertaining and a great book set for kids just starting to read chapter books (1st-3rd grade). There is mild potty humor (Roderick's band's name is 'Loded Diaper' and their hit song is 'Exploded Diaper') but it's all in good fun. (It doesn't bother me at all but I know some parents are sensitive about that kind of stuff).

B00782O7IY|5.0|\\"The Artist\\" is a 2011 motion picture about the end of the era of silent films and the birth of the talkies. Filmed in luxurious black-and-white and featuring classy title cards on-screen as a throwback to the original silent film genre, this newest production perfectly captures the pristine and amazing look of a by-gone time in cinematic history. Upon its initial release, it recieved universal acclaim from film critics and movie-goers alike. Produced on a modest budget of $15 million, it went on to earn a staggering amount of nearly $134 million during its first-run theatrical showings. The film was also awarded international accolades from the film community, dominating Best Picture prizes at the Cannes Film Festival, Golden Globes and Oscars, among others. The overall end result is a remarkable masterpiece and an instant classic. It was the first French film to ever win Best Picture (Thomas Langmann, Producer); the first mainly silent film to win since 1927's \\"Wings\\" (the first recipient of the Best Picture Award, in 1929); the first film presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio to win since 1955's \\"Marty\\"; the first black-and-white film to win since 1993's \\"Schindler's List\\"; and the first non-R-rated film to win since 2004's \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". It also earned Oscars for Michel Hazanavicius for Best Director, Jean Dujardin as Best Actor, as well as Best Costume Design and Best Original Score.<br /><br />The idea of introducing a silent movie to a new generation of movie audiences here in the 21st century is a major accomplishment that succeeds even beyond the aspirations of the filmmakers. The end result is astonishing and breathtaking, while remaining true to the art of film-making that exemplifies everything that there is to enjoy about going to a local movie theater and experiencing filmed images projected onto the silver screen. \\"The Artist\\" was released in the U.S. on DVD and Blu-ray on 26 June 2012. Both variations also include an ultra-violet digital copy of the film. It was released in the UK on 28 May 2012.<br /><br />Looking for something completely different in the ever-changing world of cinema? Then, look no further than \\"The Artist\\", a fabulous film event.the film.

B003HO54E8|5.0|Nothing captivates a child's heart like candy and in that regard this story appeals to the masses.  Willy Wonka is fascinating as the dedicated candy man looking to uphold his legacy and each character is deserving of their fate.  The book is a quick read and it is quite fun to find out how everyone, even Charlie, gets exactly what they deserve!

0062197258|5.0|You just have to make time to read this book--it's awesome!! It tells the story of young pretty Catherine Bailey. She was in a very abusive relationship with Lee. The thing that makes this book so good is that it follows her and Lee's relationship but also three years later as she is trying to recover and get back to being normal again. You get two stories at once! The writing is superb and the ending shocking! This a a page turner that is hard to beat. It doesn't get any better than this! Must read!
B005LAIHYU|1.0|I cannot for the life of me believe the glowing reviews this film has received.  A friend and I went to see this last evening; the picture played to an almost packed house.  We did not stay for the ending; I had already read about that somewhere else.<br /><br />It's one thing to construct any movie and take liberties with it.  \\"Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter\\" did that--and then some.  It was certainly a new idea to add that the South was winning the Civil War because they had vampires fighting in their armies.  These vampires could also become invisible and were \\"day walkers,\\" something that wasn't thought possible until the \\"Blade\\" series.  The movie opens with young Abe watching his mother die at the hands of a wretched vampire, his pursuit of said vampire, which almost costs him his life, his education by another person in the fine art of hunting and killing vampires, his pursuing both Mary Todd and aspirations of a political career, right on through his presidency.  In the movie, Mary Todd was a real looker--and almost as tall as Lincoln.  Talk about blurring the line between real and unreal...<br /><br />ALVH lacked soul; the actors went through the motions, but because the writers wanted to weigh down EVERY scene with needless drama, what could have been played (well) as camp, was played way too seriously.  Even the final battle between the bad boy vampire (played by Rufus Sewell) was like, ho-hum.  All the kills were CGI, which I also didn't care for.  And the drama...OH, the DRAMA.  Make up your minds, people:  either make a horror movie or make a drama.  The two just didn't mix here.<br /><br />The movie is rated R for violence and lasts 105 minutes, which was probably 15 minutes too long.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is a good search and find app. You get a lost of words or outlines of some items and then you find them in a crowed room full of random items. I like that this has a story line though I'm not too far along yet. It also has two game modes. One is timed but so far there seems like enough time to find everything before the timer runs out. The other mode is a relaxed mode, which I'm assuming is the same game just without the timer. Overall a very nice and we'll designed app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I decided to try this book out even though I had my reservations about it. And yes, the number of times she calls him \\"fifty\\" or \\"fifty shades\\" or they use that phrase gets annoying, and the book isn't entirely realistic, but isn't that the whole point of books? To escape to another world or another person's life? Yes, it does have some parts that aren't for everyone. The book itself is definitely not for everyone. For me, I was just looking for a book to entertain me for a while. This did the trick. I have read all three books in the series, and they all have managed to capture my interest right at the start. So, yes this may not be the book for you. But, if you're willing to keep an open mind and just enjoy it without scrutinizing it, you might like it. I did.

After I finished the 1st book, I could not wait to purchase the 2nd.  Now, after finishing the 2nd, I have not decided if I even WANT to read the 3rd in the series.
030758836X|3.0|While reading this book, I thought it was one of the better books I've read, very clever, etc. Until about the last 50 pages. Really??? You couldn't have come up with a better ending?? I closed the book when I finished and just stared into space, thinking \\"What just happened?\\" I hadn't read any of her previous books, but was considering doing just that.......until the ending of this book. I wouldn't recommend this book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded the \\"Wool\\" omnibus edition to my Kindle a few months ago. It sat there until I finished Hugh Howey's previous work, the various adventures of Molly Fyde - a four-book series that was, quite simply, astounding. If anything, Wool is an even better read. Howey originally presented it as a series of five closely related short stories. The omnibus edition combines these stories and it reads like a full-fledged novel. Howey is fairly new at the novelist's game but he is a talent to be reckoned with. All of his books have grabbed me by the throat and pulled me into his wonderfully-constructed worlds.<br /><br /> Our story begins in a post-apocalyptic America - approximately 300-400 years in the future. We are introduced to a series of characters that live in a subterranean silo of massive proportions. Humans have lived in this silo for generations and live a highly structured and severely limited lifestyle. Since this is all they've known for generations, most of the people accept it and go about their lives. Outside the silo is a toxic wasteland - to venture outside is a death sentence. In fact, people who do express a curiosity about what's outside can be evicted; a certain death sentence. So, talk of the outside is strictly forbidden.<br /><br /> The character development is first-rate. I learned to love nearly all of them - especially Juliette. Juliette makes this story totally rock.<br /><br /> As with any dystopian story, things go wrong and they go wrong in a very spectacular fashion. As events begin to unravel, our various protagonists - and the necessary antagonists - fall into a series of mind-boggling adventures and conflicts. When I wasn't reading this book, I was thinking about it and cutting corners so I could get back to it as soon as possible. When I finished it, I was disappointed. Why, you may ask? Well, I wanted the story to continue. Even with a small measure of resolution at the end of the book, the characters and the many obvious challenges facing them simply begs for more story. The possibilities - yes, even in a limited silo area - are virtually endless. When you read this story, you'll understand this and you'll understand it well. The author has indicated he will continue this story - and I hope he's serious about doing so.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Ridley Scott bought the film rights to this book. If true, I do hope he sees his way to film it - it would make a great movie. Scott would certainly be the best choice to produce and direct it - although I think James Cameron could also do it justice.<br /><br />There is so much this review will not tell you. To say too much is to give away a wonderful plot line full of twists and turns and wholly unexpected discoveries. No spoiler here - but I hope this review alone is sufficient to cause the reader to buy Howey's book: \\"Wool - the Omnibus Edition\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool took me by surprise. I knew, after reading other reviews, that it would deal with a grim, dystopian futuristic world. That there was something about humanity, what was left of it, being trapped inside a huge underground complex dubbed the \\"silo\\", condemned to survive there as the outside had become unfit for life. That sometimes, even conscious of signing their own death certificates, people inside the silo wanted out. And were granted their wish. Apart from that, I knew nothing.<br />And that's exactly why reading Wool was such an extraordinary experience. Spoiling such a book would be a big mistake, and even the smallest hint could be considered as a spoiler. Though this is terribly frustrating, I really believe I can't say too much and you must trust all the five-star reviews you've seen, and all the good comments you've heard. The storyline is great, the style is awesome too, and the pages fly by, even though this story is not \\"easy\\". By that I mean you don't have whole pages of dialogues, or empty paragraphs. Everything is deep (pun intended), gritty and filled with important, recurring themes, making Wool not only an amazing sci-fi story, but also a real literary achievement.<br />I've read comparisons to Herbert, Asimov and others. Reading Wool's Book one, I was more reminded of George Orwell's 1984, which is the best compliment I can make, as I consider it one of the most seminal books ever. The two novels share common themes such as control of the population through transformation or erasure of its past, constant pressure, fear, punishment. The verticality of the silo also epitomizes the symbolical social divides at work in any society. Lie and deceit are omnipresent, you can never know what's true or not, you can never believe anything at face-value. As a reader, I was as misled as the characters, believed I had cracked it and was dead wrong. Amazing stuff.<br />Another comparison imposed itself in my mind toward the end of Book 1, which is very short. I experienced the same longing I felt while watching the series Lost: very quickly, you're hooked and puzzled at the same time, and that's why you read so fast. In Wool, 1984 and Lost, lie and deceit are constant, as well as a need to escape from something quickly becoming unbearable. And you want to see who will make it. Funny how a majority escapes vicariously, through the more concrete escape of others leading to death: the scapegoats (the paradoxical sentence befalling outlaws is being sent OUT, and it's called \\"cleaning\\", turning Wool into a reenactment of the Witch Hunt at times). Each party blinded by their own personal faiths and beliefs. Funnily enough, wool is the material used to clean the camera lenses outside so dwellers in the silo can still have a view, but wool can also be put on one's eyes so he can't see... There's a constant back and forth between positive and negative in Wool, a tug-of-war between life and death, despair and hope. Just as there's a constant movement up and down the silo, down leading to the depths of hell, up leading to its threshold...<br />There's an immediate feeling of absoluteness when reading Wool, the sense that you're holding something important in your hands, a legend rooted in biblical references (the Tower of Babel, except here the highest levels don't quite reach Heaven, but only Earth, and an Earth that's getting to look like Hell, at that), and sprouting its limbs in modern tales (I remember reading a strange manga entitled \\"Blame!\\", in which the hero had to travel up and down a giant vertical subterranean structure too) . It's an instant classic mixing many things and creating a new one, poetic, strong and mystical. Why three times forty eight stories in the silo? Is it to be read 3:48: \\"Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed\\"? Is the Mayor, Marie Jahns, a new weeping prophet like Jeremiah, like him feeling a deep and abiding passion for her people and their city? I may be going too far, here. But at the same time, why not 150 stories, then? And why a choice of name so close to an anagram?<br />You tend to lend the characters that mythical potential, so extremely well-defined, strong and symbolical are they. Good or bad, they immediately leave a mark in your brain. They all stand for something, and as with the rest in this novel, there's nothing gratuitous about what they say or do.<br />OK, I need to stop. I could go on for hours. Just go and buy the damn book, because it really is AWESOME.
0345803485|1.0|I read this out of curiosity from all the hype it's been given. I have several friends who read it and absolutely loved it.  This is pure garbage.  The writing is atrotrious, the story telling is non-existent and there is no character depth or development.  On top of it all, the sex scenes are repetitive and completely unrealistic.  I love books and I've read a lot of books but this is the first book, ever, to literally put me to sleep.  I do not understand why such drivel like this is so popular. If you want to read erotica, there are plenty of other books out there that are better than this crap.

Sometimes the description of what your finding is off (such as goblet which they have you picking goblets, vases, trophies, etc) but other than slight discrepancies it 's really fun!

B007L3BMGA|4.0|Ok I didn't think this was as bad as everyone says! I seen that it was only getting 1 star and that was putting me off reading it, but with everyone talking about it I just had to read it.. And I have to say I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. If your not into these types of books then no it's not for you but if your willing to give it ago then i suggest that you do you might be surprised at the end.. I'm not going into detail on the story or characters because it's all people are talking about and if you don't no about it by know then whats up with you! :) But anyway over all it was a good book and i'm actually going to start the second one!

B0013WJGJ0|5.0|This is the way I look at Batman's transition from comic action hero to movie screen crime fighter. Anchored by Danny Elfman's theme music and Tim Burton's superb direction this movie gives us a picture of the dual Bruce Wayne/Batman personalities. In his intimidating outfit, Batman is a nimble fighter who can deliver his punches while absorbing a few. On the other side, save for his wealthy lifestyle Bruce Wayne is almost nondescript. He's a face in the crowd yet still able to convey his emotions. In BATMAN he is troubled by the trauma of his parents' murder he witnessed as a young boy. Gotham City is facing a crisis of crime and corruption and it is up to the Dark Knight to clean up the situation. We are introduced to an ambitious journalist, Vicky Vale, who arrives in town just when the Batman phenomenon is just capturing everyone's attention.<br /><br />For diehard Batman fans, there's enough gadgets in the movie to keep everyone happy. In addition to the ever present utility belt that Batman uses to fight his way out of sticky situations, there's the armored Batmobile with remote controllable feature and jagged shaped Batplane (Batjet?). Jack Nicholson as the Joker plays his semi-crazed villain role as only Nicholson can.  But when he becomes enamored with the beautiful Vicky Vale, look out - no Batman is going to get in his way. The film's exciting finale takes place in a soaring cathedral bell tower where the kidnapped and terrified Ms. Vale is forced to waltz with the Joker while his henchmen take turns trying to finish off Batman. By the way, this must be Director Burton's way to insert his droll humor in the movie - the Joker and assorted thugs trying to swat the bat in the belfry.

B000091NKT|2.0|The impression I was given is that the record was mint condition. to my surprise upon opening the box...the cover had stickers directly on it and a price sticker that someone tried to peel off and ripped the cover under it basically ruining the cover. Upon playing the record I found that there is a major skip on the very first song. The record does sound good other than that, but not mint condition as promised, kind of disappointed that someone has to lie about the condition of these items as well as not showing actual photos of the items instead of the \\"stock\\" photos that were shown. Especially for for $50.00. I could have bought a cheaper one and gotten better condition. Just a word of caution to all those considering buying a used record of this nature.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|Of course not!  if they had, the production values and acting would have been much better.  where to start?  bad lighting?  bad effects?  bad acting?  it's all there but so horribly morose you can't even enjoy it as a bad movie

B001NEK2GE|5.0|This keypad is amazing for any of my gaming needs, finding how to position your hand on it and still have good control with the joystick is a little difficult at first. But once you have gotten use to it the keypad is extremely comfortable and provides excellent wrist support. Being fully programmable I was a little worried about the setup and learning curve of this device, but the software makes setup a easy and simple process that no other keypad has provided me before. Using this for all of my drafting and flash projects has sped up my work tremendously after programming some of the G keys. Excellent product at a excellent price.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|love it. best app so far if u ask me that I came across. needs an update for the tablet tho. has it for the phone but not this :( only bad thing so hope that will come soon.
B007R41E8O|5.0|My favorite type of game...doesn't amp me up so that I can't get to sleep after I am done playing, though it provides a gentle challenge for my brain...or whatever is left of it.  Definitely a wise purchase.
B00000AOUD|5.0|When we see everyone dancing around in their underpants now in music \\"videos\\", please remember there was a time that rock/pop was music of substance and taken seriously as an art-form. This was a mammoth concept album even at the time and now seems part of a golden age of quality. The musical invention never flags and remains interesting throughout. Be brave and check this out, you won't be disappointed. Apparently Tull put this out as a piss-take of \\"concept LP's, truth is stranger than fiction; they produced a winner!
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|I have been a big fan of Linkin Park for a while now.  And like many Linkin Park fans I have been disappointed with their latest work.  I loved both \\"Hybrid Theory\\" (2000) and \\"Meterora\\" (2003), and to be honest I was surprised that I did.  I don't like Rap and I didn't really buy into the whole Nu Metal scene.  But something about Linkin Park works for me.  The vocal interplay between lead vocalist Chester Bennigton and rapper Mike Shinoda really is appealing with the added guitar riffs and electronica all just seems to wield together works very well.<br /><br />Their next album \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" (2007) was taken unevenly by the Linkin Park fan community.  With the Nu Metal scene fading Linkin Park evolved into a more rock oriented group.  The rap and hip hop elements were toned down.  I didn't have too much of a problem because I prefer rock music anyways but the album suffered from three songs on the albums that brought the quality down on the album.  Still I thought the next album would fix everything but to nightmare the next album would be their worst and like many fans I thought was complete crap.  This album was \\"A Thousand Suns\\" (2010), it had so many problems.  I thought for sure Linkin Park would never recover.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2012 Linkin Park is releasing their 5th studio album/LP and its being said that this is a return to their roots in an effort to recapture the fans they lost.  Their first album and previous band name was \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and they called themselves and their album that because it was an experimental thing to combine multiple genres of music, this album is the new \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  Not in terms of quality but in a literal sense.  This album combines multiple styles of Linkin Park, old and new.  It's got both styles so it is once again another \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  So I guess the thing almost everyone wants to know if this album delivers.  Well I will say that it is a major upgrade from \\"A Thousands Suns\\" (2010) and while isnot close to being perfect is an all-around good album and worth a buy.<br /><br />1.Lost In The Echo- The song opens up with some heavy electronic use then some nice rapping Mike Shinoda and good vocal work by Chester Bennigtion. This song gets angry later on but remains the same throughout the song.  The lyrics aren't bad either all in all its not a bad song and a pretty good opener. 8/10<br /><br />2.In My Remains- A more emotional song and it's also really good.  I really like the lyrics in the song.  And the vocals are really good as well.  With a good steady slower mid-tempo song this song is also a pretty good song.  8/10<br /><br />3.Burn it Down- The only single off this album is another good song.  With a good catchy beat and lyrics this song is one of the best ones on the album.  It will be no doubt be overplayed on the Radios so enjoy while you can.  8.5/10<br /><br />4.Lies Greed Misery- Heavy Electrics and good vocal interplay between the Rapper and The Singer but Chester really shines here with some great screaming vocals and it a throwback to earlier Linkin Park songs but the song is too short.  Only 2:26 this could have been so much better.  Still great though.  8.5/10<br /><br />5.I'll Be Gone- I would say that this is another mid-tempo song.  It's more emotional and has decent lyrics and good vocals.  It also has a good beat but still too short.  That's a problem that seems to pop up more and more on this album.  This song feels very incomplete but I can't deny the song is catchy. 7/10<br /><br />6.Castle of Glass- This song is similar to \\"I'll be gone.\\"  Mostly in terms of beat and tempo throughout the song.  However this song is one of the weakest on the album and is once again a little short.  This is a song that seems to warder without a sense of purpose. 6/10<br /><br />7.Victimized- This song is another breath of fresh air.  It's heavier with a very angry tone and great vocal interplay and plays a lot like their old songs with Chester's fantastic screaming vocals. Still though the song is too short. 8/10<br /><br />8.Roads untraveled- Another slower song with a lot of meaning written into the lyrics.  The vocals are lower in tone and the song is similar to \\"Castle of glass.\\"  I will say though I enjoy this song over Castle.  Not the best but not the worst either.  It's a pretty good song with a lot of meaning. 7/10<br /><br />9.Skin to Bone- Electronic heavy and a really great beat to go along with.  The song also boasts really good vocals throughout.  The lyrics are simply but good.  This song could have ended up on any of their albums. 8/10<br /><br />10.Until it Breaks- I love the rapping by Mike in the beginning and it also boasts a great beat but then comes a surprise.  The whole beginning you would think is an angry song but then Chester comes in with some light and easy in tone vocals and it's an interesting dynamic.  I do love some of the lyrics in the song.  One of the best on the album.  8.5/10<br /><br />11.Tinfoil- This is a pure instrumental piece and leads straight into the last song.  It's entertaining and somewhat rousing song, I enjoyed it.  8/10<br /><br />12.Powerless-The final song is actually one of the best.  It's a slower one but it's a very emotional song with great lyrics and Chester eats up every second of this song.  I really did love this song and it was one of the few songs on this album I felt like it had the right length as well.  The best on this album.  10/10<br /><br />So is this a return to fine form?  No, not yet.  It's a major upgrade from their last album without a doubt but where the album suffers is the album is too short and some of the songs needed to be longer.  It's worth buying and owning but it's far from perfect but if Linkin Park keeps on this path they might return with a masterpiece.  It might be premature to call it a \\"comeback\\" but it's pretty close to it.  This feels like an album that will grow on you, so give it a shot you might be surprise.<br /><br />Score 10 stars:  7.9<br />Score 5 stars: 3.9
B00005NTJK|5.0|I loved this Tull LP way back in the early 70's. \\"Son\\" captured how I felt being stifled and dominated by an angry Leo father. \\"Inside\\" still sizzles along. There is so much to enjoy here. I envy anyone hearing it for the first time.
B007R12TNQ|3.0|The movie was o.k., the quality of the picture was horrible. May have enjoyed the movie more if I could actually see the entire movie clearly.
B000002KOQ|5.0|This does capture for many of us the vibe/life that existed in the late 60's and early 70's of living in shared houses, smoking dope and the whole hippy dream of endless optimism and good times. (Yes Virginia, there really was such a time!) This album capture it perfectly and even if you were not there the music stands on its own after all these years.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is a fantastic writer!  I was browsing the Kindle store one day looking for a new read for vacation, and came across the Wool series.  It was a steal considering that it is five parts, and I went ahead and bought the sixth installment, First Shift, too.  I just finished the Wool omnibus (parts 1-5) and was EXTREMELY pleased with all the books.  Not quite like any books I've ever read before.  A great story that really gets you emotionally involved with the characters, and keeps you on edge for what's going to happen next.  I just started reading First Shift, and it's shaping up to be just as great as the other Wool books!  Way to go Mr. Howey!!! Please give us more Wool!!!
0345803485|4.0|Easy sultry read.  I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't receive the second one as a gift. Though the characters have some serious issues I was able to look past that and enjoy the book.
B008CP93S0|1.0|This movie was so sexual graphic I would never recommend it to anyone. It was border soft porn. Horrible movie!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its do fun and addictive! its cool and fun cause you make your own town and buy things 4it! its a must buy :)
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|The acting was great, the story was great, action was nearly nonstop. I don't have any thing bad to say about this movie. I watched this movie free with my amazon prime membership.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|Excellent quality highly recommended. Very sturdy once assembled.<br />Now I can enjoy my JVC headphones again!!!!<br />Please make sure you get the cable through the round metal nut before you assemble it, otherwise you will have to cut the cable and re-do.<br />Again, highly recommended.
0345529057|5.0|This series is flat out awesome. I loved Lord of the Rings but I think that this surpasses it. A realistic fantasy (truly) novel that sets the bar to compare all other works of fantasy to. The first book is the best (in my opinion) and if you have seen the HBO series before buying these like I did than the book will seem even better as it follows right along nearly line for line for with the show. The second books seems to be a bit weaker than the first but is still amazing in its own right. Differs from the show a fair amount and I think I focused more on that than I should have. I am about half way through the third book and I am giving up time for other things to keep reading it. I have read some reviews on how it and the fourth book are bogged down but that doesn't seem to be the case so far.<br />I highly recommend these books to anyone who want to get lost in  wonderfully and skillfully created world filled with intrigue war and magic
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome put of all the games I have and I let all my friends play it and then the get it
B0055SWM08|3.0|the hint prices should not go up!! but it still is a really fun game.i love it and so dose my mom.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I downloaded this app when it was on sale for 99&cent; and needed an office suite.  It is flaky at times but usually works.  My only real complaint is that when editing some documents I need to tab between items, and there is no way to insert a tab like in pages on my iphone.  Then again what should I expect for 99&cent;.
B0081SRJSY|2.0|I suppose this Android version of Carcassonne is better than none at all. The graphics seem busy to me,especially the blinking, flashing options for your Meeples.<br />The Itunes version seems much more elegant.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|tons of fun and hours of building time for the kids. teaching kids about planning and the need to think ahead.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a ROMANCE! A Love Story! Okay, so it touches on BDSM, so what. I thought it was wonderful.  I've read much more graphic erotica novels (books that I had to put down, because they creaped me out, made me uncomfortable). I've read this book, and the others in the series twice, and will probably read them again.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|As in previous mission impossible movies, there's some great stunts and special effect, plety of running, chasing, car crashes, explosions... what else do you want? I had a good time.
B0086700CM|4.0|find myself playing any time I am not busy. I want to stop, but cant. I kill the battery on my kindle daily
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have never written a review.  I bought the book because most of the reviews were very good.  I thought the book was very good until I got to 86% read on my kindle.  I was really disappointed in the last part of the book, I felt like I had wasted time reading to come to an end like this one.  May be just me but it was such a let down.  Hope I don't get any comments on my grammer.<br />Disappointed
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was awesome. as someone who lived through the tail end of the 90s some of the stuff was not gotten, but I actually understood about 87% percent of it (only going to show that i have no life.)<br /><br /> The idea of a torn apart freezing distopia chilled me... figuatively cuz its a cruel summer<br />but the idea of everyone escaping into a virtual utopia is grim. reading some other reviews, it seems like this might be pretty done but WTFever. i didnt catch that cold. born 2 late. whatevz.<br /><br />SO essensially if u r a completely nerdy 13ish persn u`ll get it otherwise back away slowly.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I grew up loving this movie and was worried the book would deminish my fond memories of the movie. In all actuallity it fullfilled my longing, from the movie version,of wanting to know more about each character. You could almost feel the author pouring her soul into this story as she captures all the romance and poignancy of the era in such a manner that you feel as if you could step right into the book and fit right in. The book was INCREDIBLY well written and detailed with out being verbose, repetative, or boring. This should be a required read in school for YA readers.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I thought this was great fun and enjoyable for what it was - a really solid action movie. The stunts were great and I WANT that car!
B007KL8Z40|5.0|When I first stumbled upon Ane Brun on Youtube, I chuckled when one viewer called the video and music mesmerizing. However, before I knew it, I was closing my eyes and being sucked into her world. The album follows right on par with her other songs. If you haven't listened to her yet, I insist you do it now. You won't regret it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I must say these books are incredible. I know some reviews complain b/c of all the sex scenes. Well first of all, this trilogy is more than sex scenes. The first book has to give you the background of Grey's life! The next two books are about a romance and love that is so strong two people grow and change for the better for each other. This story is about loving someone so much and and realizing what life is about. I could not put these books down! I actually read them three times. If you cannot get past the passionate sex they share and look at the big picture then these books are not for you. However, I can say that this definatley spiced things up for me! I cannot wait for the movie to be produced! I would consider myself a heavy reader and these by far top my list!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great game the really tests your reflexes. On the Fire it is a bit touchy at times but over all it is a wonderful way to pass time in a boring meeting. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|....... sike! !!!!!!! this is the best game in the world!!!! I think that this is the best game I have evered played!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|I normally enjoy reading crime novels, but after so many peers talking about the Hunger Games I decided to give them a read. That was a great decision. Even though these books were totally out of my normal preferred \\"genre\\" I thoroughly enjoyed each book. I think Collins created characters that not only grabbed ahold of you by the collar and held onto you until the last line, but ones that you truly cared for until the last page.<br /><br />I flew through this first book and could not wait to pick up the second book.<br /><br />I highly suggest getting all 3 books at one time so you can move through them at your own pace and there isn't any down time in between them! I devoured these and look forward to her future works.<br /><br />And of course the movie did no justice to these books.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love these kinds of games! they are so fun and addicting! i also like pie! :) it is very yummy!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun for the kids and me .  we play daily.  put it my kindle so the kids had something to play on a road trip.  I took it over.
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best game to play with all age groups.<br />we play all day Long cuz it is that 0('.')0 gppd
B005LAIH5O|2.0|I love the movie the 2 stars is due to yet again another terrible UltraViolet that can not be imported into my Itunes Movie Library.  Wow I can stream it...sorry all but again the movie was amazing and I also loved the first and hope their is a 3rd.  But when you sell a digital copy 95% of the customers want it for their apple products so let's stop trying to make these digital copies that don't do what customers want.  Digital Copy = Itunes
B001AVCFK6|4.0|OK, let me get the bad-mouthing out of my system and then I'll move on to giving the movie its deserved due.<br /><br />\\"Star Trek\\" (2009) is an absolute load of peanut butter when it comes to a coherent, believable story. I'll try to avoid spoilers while saying what I have to say, which is basically this: This whole idea of a supernova threatening the planet Romulus is absolute stupidity. Wherever this supernova was, it certainly was NOT Romulus' own sun. Given the vast distances between interstellar objects, and given the scientific abilities of the Romulans in the 24th century, THERE IS JUST NO WAY that the Romulan people would have been destroyed by this celestial event. They would have evacuated the planet, if nothing else, and would have had plenty of time to do so, even AFTER Spock's \\"red matter\\" solution (whatever the bleep THAT is) had failed. So the whole premise of the Romulan Nero being enraged by Spock's failure is quite simply ... ludicrous.<br /><br />ALL RIGHT ... all that amounts to mere nitpicking. \\"Star Trek\\" always has dabbled in suspect science; warp drive itself is an apparent violation (or evasion) of Einstein. What made the original series, and its sucessors, and most of the movies successful is the spirit of the whole enterprise (pun intended), including the strong characterizations of the crew. And that's where the 2009 reboot of \\"Star Trek\\" gets it right.<br /><br />First of all, the casting is impeccable. Not just Chris Pine as Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock, but ALL the main characters. Karl Urban is just ornery enough as Dr. McCoy, Zoe Saldana absolutely sparkles as Uhura, John Cho captures Sulu's calm and good humor, Anton Yelchin plays up Chekhov's weirdness, and, best of all, Simon Pegg makes Scotty even more comically relieving than the original.<br /><br />The actors clearly like and respect one another, whereas in the original cast, there was some significant resentment on the part of some toward William Shatner. The result is a more ensemble feel which serves this film quite well.<br /><br />And the story, absurd as it is, does careen along at warp speed. The pace of the movie is, for the most part, breakneck, and you can't help being carried along by it.<br /><br />Finally, the special effects: They are, quite simply, the best in \\"Trek\\" history.<br /><br />In short, the movie won me over despite my considerable objections to the story. I do hope that the sequel makes a little more sense. Meanwhile, this first re-imagining is, if nothing else, a REALLY good time.result is a more ensemble feel which serves this film quite well.<br /><br />And the story, absurd as it is, does careen along at warp speed.

030758836X|5.0|Three words describe this great summer read: \\"Thrilling and Insane\\". You will not be able to put it down. Go ahead, order it. Now.
0441013597|4.0|So much has been written about Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" in the nearly 50 years since its publication that it's difficult for the modern reader to come at the novel with expectations that are even remotely realistic. As for readers like me -- I've probably read the book half a dozen times by now, if not more -- I'm sometimes not entirely sure what I think of it myself. At times, it can seem very pretentious to me, and there are occasions, when revisiting it, that the precious, overweening dialogue drives me straight up the wall. But when I return to it with an open mind, I re-experience what drove me through it on my first reading: The sense of awe, the marvel of it, the magnificence and ambition of its narrative.<br /><br />\\"Dune\\" truly is an epic novel, not just because it's more than 500 pages long. It's the scope of the book that resonates with readers, I think -- this is a \\"science fiction\\" novel that's also about religion, mysticism, race memory, politics, ecology, warfare and diplomacy. It's a huge book, but it doesn't wander, nor does it get mired down in its many themes.<br /><br />Thankfully, the story is strong, which keeps the book moving. Paul Atreides may or may not be the new messiah, the young man who, according to prophecy, will lead the Fremen of Arrakis to dominate the known Universe. His father, Duke Leto Atreides, is murdered by the Harkonnens -- royal cousins, yes, but also sworn enemies of House Atreides. It falls to Paul to explore the potential of the desert-dwelling Fremen, even as he begins to experience his own powers of prescience and considerable gifts for leadership. Long oppressed by the Harkonnens, the Fremen are only too glad to accept a young leader willing to upend not just the politics of the planet, but of all humanity.<br /><br />Herbert's storytelling genius was matched by his larger vision. Clearly, water-starved Arrakis is a metaphor for our own world's dependance on oil. But it turns out that \\"Dune\\" was literally about water, too -- that is, Herbert realized when he was writing it that water would become, over time, an increasingly precious substance. All you have to do these days to realize he was right is pay attention to the news -- news of droughts, yes, but also water rights being bought up by companies looking to profit at a situation some in our culture see as increasingly alarming.<br /><br />\\"Dune's\\" other great theme -- and warning -- is its exploration at the apparently universal human desire for a messiah-like figure to emerge and provide hope, wisdom and guidance. As \\"Dune\\" reveals, such a desire has its dark side. Paul Atreides transformation into Paul-Maud'dib comes with a terrible price, both to himself and, ultimately, to his people.<br /><br />Fiction writers are supposed to create worlds in which we can immerse ourselves, worlds that seem as real as our own, at least while we are turning those pages. Science fiction writers, especially, have the task of creating entire alternate worlds that nevertheless seem believable, even plausible. While some of the science in \\"Dune\\" is rather \\"soft\\" compared with other novels in the genre, it really doesn't matter. After all these readings, I'm still not exactly sure how, for example, a Guild Heighliner achieves faster-than-light speed, except that it \\"folds\\" space, and requires a navigator who has at least some ability to see into the future. Beyond that, Herbert doesn't offer much in the way of explanation. No worries; you'll be carried along by the author's enthusiastic narrative drive.too -- that is, Herbert realized when he was writing it that water would become, over time, an increasingly precious substance.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great graphics and works well on my Kindle Fire.  Very entertaining. You can skip through the story line if you choose and opt out of the mini games, which offer no instructions and can take a little time to figure out but otherwise it's great fun!
B007V508CC|5.0|I just love everything about Maroon 5 especially their lead singer!!! Just perfect he can do IT ALL SING WRITE THA BEST SONGS PLAY GUITAR DRUMS too bad he already has a girlfriend
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Totally addictive puzzle whether you are an avid puzzle lover (such as myself) or just looking for something to pass a few minutes. I installed on both my DROIDX and Kindle Fire and have experienced no technical issues. I thought I might tire of the puzzles already completed when switching devices, but that was not the case. The easier ones still held me while the more difficult offered every bit as much challenge as the first time I completed them. Enjoy!!!
B000002UB2|1.0|What you get is not the 2009 Abbey Road remastered album, but a 1995 Capitol pressing the sounds like a used record. This Lp actually sounds like a badly used record (I have used LPs that sound better.) Do not pay attention to the reviews for this item because they mostly refer to the 2009 remastered CD.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of levels and different types of games. skill level seems to be fifteenth for each which keeps it fun! It keeps me entertained which is all I ask for!!

0143119680|3.0|While I enjoyed the premise and I liked Matthew, the heroine drove me crazy and I had a difficult time relating to her.  She was continually described as strong and powerful, but she spent an inordinate amount of time either sleeping, being nursed back to health, or eating eggs and drinking tea.  While the various creatures that Diana encountered were supposedly intimidated by her Bishop heritage I thought Diana displayed very little strength or power.  The fact that she and Matthew never consummated their \\"marriage\\" was a little hard to believe, too, and a big disappointment.  The author tried to so hard to create sexual tension between them, but then didn't come through with the goods.  The few love scenes that she did include were pretty lackluster.  Overall, this book was a bit of a disappointment.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely loved this game.  For the first few hours that I had Temple Run I COULDN'T STOP PLAYING.  Very addictive.  Lots of fun.
1936608898|5.0|For those of us who are just starting the Paleo lifestyle this is clear and concise book that will start you on a road to health.  You want more scientific writing, check out any of Gary Taubes's books, Robb Wolfe's book or Nora Gedgaudhas's book.  Melissa and Dallas have done an amazing job of clarifying the Paleo diet and they have tons of references to back up their work.  I met Melissa and Dallas at a Paleo conference and they radiate health; it's obvious they practice what they preach!
B0086700CM|4.0|it is good but it lags in many things I hope it improves because it is so annoying about if it goes to fast or to slow
B005EGXNLS|4.0|This has been a wonderful series. Historical perspective and lifestyle descriptions when woven into a story well told is a real treat. The only problem is that the series climax has been foretold.  It will be interesting to see how Uhtred's return to Bebbanburg is accomplished.  I only wish the questions was \\"if\\" and not \\"how\\".  Minor problem though.  Cannot wait.

B00008DDRX|5.0|Great movie.  Steve McQueen is great in it.  The classic battle between the porsche 917 and ferrari.  A treat if you were a race fan or a kid in the 1970's.  Also if you are a fan of porsche, you will enjoy this.  I have made it a habit of watching the movie every summer.  Typically after LeMans is done.  There are icons throughout the movie.  Watch the beautiful 911 driving through town at the beginning of the movie!
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie,its such a different and modern take on beauty and the beast.I liked Alex Pettyfer in \\"i am number four\\" and he did a great job in this movie too.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I love jigsaw puzzles but never seem to find the right place or lighting.  And I don't like getting to the end only to find you're missing a piece.  I carry my kindle fire everywhere so I can work on a puzzle while waiting at the doctor, sitting by the pool or just relaxing. What a great selection!!  I have enough downloaded to keep myself busy for a long time.  And that's just the free ones!!  If you love puzzles then get this app; you wont be sorry!!  The only update I could imagine would be the ability to change the background color; its sometimes hard to see the dark colors on the dark background but I turn the brightness all the way up in my kindle main settings.
B001LM9IK4|5.0|Jake Barnes,an ex pat journalist in Paris,is deeply in love with Brett,an English woman who nursed him through injury in the Great War.But it is a love that cannot be fulfilled. Her beauty infatuates Cohn, a Jewish writer and friend of Jakes,and he reads more into a brief flirtation than Brett herself.<br /> Taking a holiday to Spain to watch the week long fiesta and bullrunning with friends, Brett falls in love with Romero the bull fighter and tensions rise....<br /> An absolutely brilliant book. Initially it seems a bit scatter gun-characters come and go and enjoy the party life of ex pats in Paris and everything is described in Hemingway's simultaneously laconic and detailed prose, so that you wonder where your being taken,but the whole story simply builds and builds into an ever more vivid and powerful picture (you really do feel you are there!)and you have one of those rare books that gives you a real high.<br /> The theme of love and wartime is obviously one that haunted Hemingway-he was wounded and nursed in WW1. Its an irony to me now as I loathed 'Farewell to Arms' when I attempted to read it aged 12. I was encouraged to return to Hemingway years later and his whole style and power just hit home big time. 'To Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'Fiesta' both told of wartime love and I rate them as high as I possible can-easy with the other greats I've read- so I'm really looking forward to returning to 'Farewell' to catch all I missed first time. My message is, if you're at a stage where Hemingway sucks for you, please give him another go later. The absolute high his works give are more than worth it.<br /> A fantastic book.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|It doesn't come as a surprise the critics didn't receive Valtari well. Its sound is too subtle to be picked apart fairly in a first impression. The only reason I gave the album as concerted effort as I did was because of my respect for the group and relief in their return to their classic style. Otherwise I would have only given it as much time as the critics did: enough to see that there's nothing new, no loud revelations, and only so much reflection on their past success. The four years aged their style past its peak of flavor, so to speak.<br /><br />Unlike Agaetis Byrjun and Takk... there is no outright moment of conversion when the group's artistic style bows to its new prince. There's no single song on Valtari that can stand alone like Hjartað Hamast or Glósóli. You experience from song to song a steady widening that slowly inflates the boundaries of what they've built in the past. Adding nothing, Valtari spreads the old pieces around in a dark room waiting for the participant to fumble his way to them and lay his hands on them. I think this is what the New York Times' Jon Pereles, the most apt of the Valtari critics, meant when he wrote that \\"each of the new songs looms within a larger, obsessively detailed ambience . . . as if the band's old pure musical sanctuary has been overgrown and started to crumble, with different light and air glinting through the cracks,\\" except that I don't agree the softening is really like the passage of time. This is just a positive spin on the critics' observation. To show this I'll merit his metaphor with an extension. The sanctuary was always overgrown and crumbling, but Agaetis and ( ) were so deep inside it you wouldn't know. Takk was really the first sight of washed out light seeping in. Valtari has tentatively emerged.<br /><br />You can even note a difference among Sigur Rós fans, too. Valtari has separated the sheep from the goats. (As a clue to who is who, it's significant that one bandmember has said Valtari is the only album he'll sit down and listen to.) This is a work that demands your time and patience, and the half of us just waiting for flair give up on it. I listened to the album twice (without breaks) with the expectation of just familiarizing myself. Music usually grips, excites, or fractures me. Each listen, my experience came up just a little short of what I wanted, and I deferred my \\"real\\" listen to the future. Before my third time I recognized it was the moment, and this time I heard it as something from the past, maybe jumping over the present to the future, but certainly not something existing then at that hour I could affect intellectually. After about fifteen minutes I stopped thinking about the music, and I felt like a stone had been dropped into the surface of my mind as into a lake, and I observed, in medias res, the chords and harmonies as ripples spreading out smoothly within me. It was a calming word: \\"You are capable of waiting; you waited for this.\\" I have never been so abundantly awarded by contemporary music. Valtari hasn't gotten over the old albums. It has consummated them.<br /><br />I suppose that's why they say this is the classical music of the twenty-first century. At the same time, this is a vignette, not a masterpiece. I think even those other fans defending it will agree with me on this one. You do have to hear the album end-to-end, and it operates more as an artistic moment than a narrative or epic. I think that's a good thing. Jonsi has said enough pretentious things in the past to make me believe they'd attempt the latter too soon. But they may be prepared now, with Valtari as groundwork. Whether or not Sigur Rós need a long haitus like their inspiration, Arvo Pärt, in order to achieve that, their flock will wait to see.
B007V508CC|2.0|Maroon 5 has turned into another over Process hot shot smoke and mirrors act in hollywood. the music and Production are glossy and accesible, however the songs are generic and lack and punch or bite. mind you they were always one of those acts that on the surface might be  alright for today's standards, but even in today's climate musically they are liteweight to me and I never got the hype. Adam Levine knows he could have a successful solo career and that might be on deck in the future, however these songs don't go anywhere. i gotta wonder will Maroon 5 be the Bon Jovi of their  era and make it last on 3 chords and 2 and a half songs into a few decades or go away like Huey Lewis and the News or a Sugar Ray basically acts that were happening withing a certain time period and then folks saw beyond the smoking mirrors and pulled the plug on that mess.<br /><br />not one song here really stands out and they came back with a album a bit fast with not much juice. time will tell if this is enough for them to get by or if there time is almost is up as a  band.

B007VT6QSI|1.0|so i got to hear this album and say if this cat showed any signs of growth or depth? well just saying that alone makes for good comedy.<br /><br />if i was managing this cat's career i'd have him more in the Bryan Adams lane a fellow canadian who started off in the  dance pop area and quickly  went toward ballads that have not only kept his pockets stuffed with loot, but also a healthy career and he can tour off of songs.<br /><br />Justin Bieber comes off like a broke version of you name it.  you can hear him straining desperately at trying to sound like  Michael Jackson and that fails.<br /><br />then his mentor  Usher is felt on his vocal stylings and that doesn't work, then you got that other flavor of the month from a few years back Justin TImberlake whom you can hear on Bieber in places and it doesn't come all the way into focus.<br /><br />then you hear a Chris Brown thing on hear and thats not saying a whole lot.<br /><br />Bieber needs some real adult based songs and material that highlight him as a singer.<br /><br />once the Novelty wears off what is this cat going to fall back on? this album sounds so formulated and he is at the mercy of his producers and what is being fed into a system which isn't preparing him for the next wave.<br /><br />bottom line I don't mind hype if you got the material and the voice to pull it off which this cat truly doesn't have right now.<br /><br />the powers that be might want a younger Elvis, however right now he is more Pat Boone.  faking the funk like he is pinoocho.
0380977273|4.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes was a very interesting read for me. I don't think I've ever read a book quite like this before (this is my first Bradbury novel).<br /><br />The novel itself it beautifully written--at times, almost magical. Bradbury's prose is more along the lines of poetry at many points. This is a positive and also a negative. On the positive side, I think it adds an eeriness to the story. On the negative side, if you aren't used to reading this style of storytelling, it could very well hinder the story and cause disinterest. At first, I was put off by the poetic style. However, the more I read the more I began to enjoy it.<br /><br />I love the \\"evil carnival comes to town\\" theme. I liked the main characters, two kids named Will and Jim. I loved the relationship Will has with his father.<br /><br />As much as I liked this book, I couldn't give it 5 stars. I thought the ending was a bit, well, cheesy (for lack of a better word). But, even with that it was a really good novel and I enjoyed it tremendously.
B007MJ9LA2|2.0|Carlos  Santana talk about  a comeback story? he was hot and happening from 99-02 and he milked that cow like a diary farm was going out of business.  now he is back into what he truly does and that is be a instrumentalist and not 999 guest appearences.  now while he made a good choice of getting back to basics, alot of this album is sleepy time music which tends to not really go anywhere. its a step in the right direction and hopefully the next album he will showcase the fusion and groove a bit more,however i dig the thought of a carlos santana album and not a Clive  Davis pulling the strings show on album.
0439023513|5.0|I just finished Mockingjay literally 10 minutes ago and like a lot of reviewers here, I feel a little sad and hollow. I wasn't going to write a review because most of the feelings that I had about the book and the series itself have already been covered by previous reviewers. But I disagree quite strongly with a high- ranked 3 star review (about Peeta being \\"the light\\") so it turns out I'm writing a review after all. Or a rebuttal. I agreed with much of the review in question, but wholeheartedly disagree that the ending is hopeless- devoid of any promise of future happiness and filled with the idea that the war was fought in vain. I don't find that to be the case at all, in fact it couldn't be further from the truth. Yes, Katniss was our heroine- the one we followed, and cried for, the one we loved and hoped for. Peeta as well, and Gale and Cinna, Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Rue, Haymitch, Prim... We loved all these people very much. But what you have to accept in reading these books is that you are reading a story of a horrible, bloody WAR- where more life will be lost than saved. But this was a war for FUTURE independence, for FUTURE hope. The war was being fought so that one day, perhaps good people like Katniss and Peeta could be allowed to have children who wouldn't starve to death in the street or kill eachother in the Hunger Games. That was the whole point of the books... That the people we grew to love had to suffer, and continued to suffer in the battle to bring about a brighter, better future where hopefully, the atrocities we painfully watched them face would not continue into further generations. And from the ending we were given, it is clear that the battle was won. The atrocities have not continued, but ceased. While Katniss, Peeta and all the others we loved are perhaps horribly, irreparably changed by the horrors they faced in order to bring about this safer, more hopeful new world- I like to think of their children. The little girl with Katniss's hair- the toddler with Peeta's blue eyes and how they happily play and frolic in the meadow, not yet knowing just how many died so they could truly live. That other reviewer was right when she said that Katniss seemed somewhat lacking in hope, but we were with her through everything. From reliving her father's death, to being ripped from her family and tortured in nightmarish arenas, being forced to become a killer, losing her home, never being allowed to trust, down to the murder of the girl that was the most precious thing in the world to her. That the Mockingjay even survived all of this is the only miracle we can expect. The fact that she ended up realizing her love for Peeta and gave him two children who will thrive and be allowed to prosper and be happy in the world their parents sacrificed everything to create for them? This is the greatest gift of all. Bottom line- the characters we loved from the beginning were born into doom and any wise reader should have seen that to turn it all around was going to require their entire hearts and souls, if not their very lives. So they gave them up. Katniss did. Peeta did. Prim did. Finnick did. Haymitch did. Gale did. They all did. But now Peeta and Katniss's children are playing... Happy. They're free. Bottomest line- OUR people? Irrefutably changed/damaged/killed by war. But the people of our people? The next generations?  They ARE hope personified. So don't give me this bs about \\"no hope\\" because that is the only thing to celebrate at the end of this AMAZING trilogy. We lost so much. But hope lives on. It was all for the glory of a greater future. If you can't understand this, you do not understand the concept of sacrificing everything for loving something more.he toddler with Peeta's blue eyes and how they happily play and frolic in the meadow, not yet knowing just how many died so they could truly live.

0307341577|2.0|One of those books that was just interesting enough I felt compelled to finish. The author's technique of flashing back to the \\"killing day\\" was very good. However by the middle we know the characters and thier flaws. Then it is a wait for the answer to be revealed. Then we are treated to unbelievable coincidences and in my opinion a rather dumb, disappointing ending.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I've read most of the materials written about Aryton Senna after having watched and read about his F1 career.  This DVD takes you deeper into his less public side and you get a sense of a man driven to win, yet haunted by something.  A very good addition to anyone's Senna collection; or a great starting point to learn about the person who still is considered the best driver to have competed in F1.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|What is the book about?<br />Rose Hathaway is learning that her life is about protecting Lissa with no exceptions. Her wants are whatever is best for Lissa. The only one that can change how she feels about the rules is Dimitri.<br /><br />Rose is noticing the more Lissa is using her magic the darker her mind is becoming, eventually leading in ghost shadows that warn her of evil that is lurking near the campus.<br /><br />Feeling obligated to protect Lissa and everyone else's lives is conflicting and she will have to choose who to help in the end.<br /><br />What did I think of the book?<br />This was by far the most emotional book so far that I've read from Richelle Mead. How she writes about all the trouble and turmoil that Rose is going through you really find yourself sympathetic towards her and all that seems to fall around her. Dimitri and Rose's chapter that took place in the cabin in the woods was so beautiful and sweet which is exactly how it should have been.<br /><br />Of course the book leaves you hanging and needing more, so I will be downloading the next book tonight and reading late into the evening if I have to. Richelle Mead is an excellent author and I will continue to read her books as long as she writes them. So far, this is my favorite book in the Vampire Academy series.

B00846REIS|5.0|After finishing Bared to You I am experiencing a bevy of emotions. It's been a week since I finished this book and I still haven't stopped thinking about it. I'm feigning for more. This book is definitely not for the feint of heart. It's dark and moving with almost all of the characters moving through their lives in a tortured existence. There were some scenes that were difficult to get through, but they helped me to better understand the characters and the emotions that they were feeling.<br /><br />For the first part of the book I was a little skeptical and I almost put it in the DNF pile. It just seemed to drag and I was not getting a good feel from the characters at all. Eva can't make up her mind about how she feels about Gideon propositioning her and Gideon just comes across as a crazy psycho stalker. I honestly couldn't stand him at first and thought he was an over the top domineering jerk. But once we got to know him a bit better we find out he's an extremely tortured soul who just doesn't really know how to act socially around others. He is so used to people using him for their own gain, that he's never really learned how to open up to others. He has many demons in his closet and they are currently running his life and because of this, he never lets anyone in. That is until he meets Eva.<br /><br />With Eva there is something different about her, and both Gideon and Eva find it hard to stay away from one another. There is a constant push and pull between the two and to be honest, at times becomes a bit much after awhile. Both feel so strongly towards the other but they just keep pushing each other away, or rather Eva keeps running away.<br /><br />I felt like Eva is constantly looking for a way out. She claims to love Gideon and wants to be with him but as something happens that she doesn't seem to like she bails. She says one thing but her actions or projecting something else completely. In fact at times I don't really know how I feel about these two. Their relationship is just so volatile at times. I understand both have extremely traumatizing pasts, but I wish they both would have opened up a bit more, or in Eva's case to stop running.<br /><br />These two are seriously hot together but honestly it's so much more than the sex that kept me turning the pages. I am drawn to both characters and their story. I am rooting for these two. I want them to get the HEA they so deserve. I want them to conquer and overcome the demons of their past and move forward. I am eager to see where their relationship takes them in the next two books and I can't wait to get me hands on them.r relationship is just so volatile at times.

B008BYXQJY|1.0|I've had the release date marked on my calendar for ages now and I was excited to hear what Maroon 5 had been up to.  This album is so very disappointing.  As previous users have said, all of the songs sound exactly the same (AutoTuned and unoriginal), the lyrics are meaningless and rely predominantly on some variation of \\"oohs\\" to fill in the gaps, etc.  I'd expect this poor quality from a first-release, teeny-bop boy band (I'm looking at you, One Direction!), but not from a band that has been around for so many years.  What a very sad fall.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought it for an AMD Phenom x4 955 BE. As anyone who has owned an AMD CPU before will tell you, the stock fan is quite loud. Piercingly loud. This was about $30, the low end of aftermarket CPU coolers. It came with easy instructions and went on with no problems. Also it included it's own tube of thermal paste, far more than enough for a single application. A nice touch really.<br /><br />Performance: On it's lowest speed setting I never saw my CPU top 43c, and that was during a Prime95 test. Very efficient.<br /><br />Noise: On high it's noticeable, but only if you're obsessed with noise like me. Just keep it on manual/minimum and you will never notice it. It is truly silent.<br /><br />Life: I owned one for 10 months. Not a single problem once.<br /><br />Installation. Went on easy enough for an aftermarket fan. Some fans are simply a royal PIA to put in. ONE NOTE: If you have an AM3/AM2/AM3+ CPU you will have to mount the fan sideways, blowing up or down. For me this was not an issue, as I had twin 140mm top-mounted fans on my case which aided the cooling better then the rear exhaust.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />I've owned this cooler for 10 months now and couldn't be happier. An amazing cooler not only for it's price but in general. The reason I am no longer using it and writing a final review is I have upgraded to a 2600k. With it I also bought a Cooler Master V8 CPU cooler. This made it painfully clear how easy it was to install the Hyper 212 in comparison. The V8 took me 15 minutes with a friend to get it on, and the thermal grease was not as neat as it should be by the time we finally did get it on. This is a definite buy for anyone looking for an aftermarket CPU fan but doesn't need anything showy.
0451228375|3.0|I was very excited about reading World Without End. I stumbled upon Pillars of the Earth last year and really liked that book. It was a sprawling epic and I felt the story arc and characters were well developed and compelling. World Without End was not quite as compelling. The story was sprawling but much more telegraphed than its predecessor. Foreshadowing is one thing, but I felt it was too easy to predict which direction the narrative was heading at too many different points. That made the story feel simplistic at times. The characters were interesting but I felt many of the major players felt like caricatures or rehashes of characters in Pillars. Merthin being Jack Builder, Aliena being split into Caris and Phillipa, Waleran Bigod split into Godwyn and Philemon, Ralph Fitzgerald being William Hamleigh reincarnated, right down to having an eternal evil crony ( Alan Fernhill from 'Pillars' Walter).<br /> I felt the political intrigue portion of World Without End was not nearly as,,, intriguing as that of Pillars. The big reveal was somewhat of a letdown but I know Follett tries hard to maintain historical accuracy. Any salacious revelation would already have been well documented by history, so Follett was only left with a vague and historically inconsequential direction in which to take the book's \\"secret\\".. World Without End was a bit underwhelming in its reveal quite like Dan Brown's 'Lost Symbol' was compared to the far more provocative 'The DaVinci Code' and its \\"secrets\\". I also felt Follett seemed to rush to wrap World Without End up quickly and with a neat little bow towards the end. Almost like he was up against a deadline or something. But I did like the trials and tribulations that the plague caused the inhabitants of Kingsbridge. I also found the stories of Wulfric and Gwenda, and their dealings with Ralph, to be a very good read. They were secondary to Caris and Merthin but in many ways more interesting.<br /> There was a lot more sensuality in this book but I found it somewhat juvenile. It seemed written from the perspective of a 15 year old boy; all too concerned with female wetness, plump bodies and pubic hair. It's kind of unrealistic and distracting when these strong and dynamic female characters are quickly brought to the pinnacle of lust by bearded englishmen swiftly and roughly grabbing a breast.. Well, that doesn't seem to work when I do it, but I'm not a bearded Englishman either.<br />  All in all I enjoyed World Without End but felt it to be almost like reading a follow up book a skilled up and coming author would write based on reading Pillars of the Earth. Like reading one of the novels based on Star Wars or Halo or whatever. World Without End felt a bit like an homage to its predecessor. I wanted something that could stand on its own more.
0515149489|5.0|Okay, I admit I'm a huge NR fan. I waited to buy this book because of some of the negative reviews out there. I shouldn't have. Fiona, Simon and the dogs are some of the best characters Nora has ever written, and that's saying something. The suspense is tangible throughout the book. Fiona is amazing. I'm not going to recap the story here, everybody else has done that. I'm only writing this for those of you who are hesitating because of some of those reviews. I'm annoyed with myself that I waited. I loved it and will reread it many times. LOVED Jaws, the puppy. Great dog training tips, by the way. Fabulous book, Nora. Thanks. I was a little worried about the serial killer angle, after her only truly horrible book Blue Smoke. Very Silence of the Lambs horror genre. But she didn't go to that extreme here, thank God. So,great read.
145162445X|2.0|First of all, just to get this out of the way, I wish this didn't turn into a theistic/atheist discussion as that's not what it's about. There can be SOMETHING instead of NOTHING and it have nothing at all to do with a \\"God.\\" Just wanted to say...<br /><br />As for Krauss and his book...<br /><br />Every time that Krauss tries to explain his 'nothing' it doesn't take him ten seconds before he starts talking about particles. I hear this in his interviews as well. I want every interviewer that talks to Krauss to interrupt him at that word 'particles' and say -- \\"...no particles are allowed, we're talking about 'nothing' right now, Sir.\\"<br /><br />I would be easier on Krauss if he wasn't so incredibly arrogant. There's some good things in this book, but it's overshadowed by a certainty about something that isn't certain at all. His 'nothing' is not my 'nothing.' It's a semantic problem but, boy, when you're talking about 'nothing' in this context, you better be more certain with your definition than Dr. Krauss is.

0091937531|5.0|Though I've read countless history books, mostly on 20th Century Wars, never have I been transported so vividly to a battlefield.  Until Saving Private Ryan came out, WWII was our 'glamorous' war if you will.  So many heroic movies were made throughout the 50's and on starring every leading man in Hollywood.<br /><br />Sledges book truly strips the varnish off what the meatgrinder is like.  Mechanized slaughter.  The stunning contrast between Marines who just want to see their families again and Japanese who, while many surely hailing from simple lives and loving families, resigned to throw their lives away at the highest possible cost to their enemy. The gripping scenes of him stuck in a flooded foxhole with putrid remains around, waiting for orders to be sent into the fray while each sides artillery furiously flies overhead in each direction is one of the most sobering reads ever.  Knowing these ordinary guys were out there doing extraordinary things for us is palpable.<br /><br />I was a Navy fighter pilot from '89 to '97 and, though I saw plenty pics of my handywork from two Iraq tours, I never came close to what Sledge felt, being resigned to near certain death or maiming.  Ok, the night carrier landings were no picnic. But its impossible to exaggerate how huge a sacrifice so many regular Americans made, yanked out of their quiet lives and thrust into hell against a vicious, clever, well-armed enemy.<br /><br />The scene during mop up ops after the Okinawa battle had ended of the two Imperial officers in full dress uniform, boots polished, charging a Marine brigade armed only with Samurai swords to certain death is so contrary to any Western mentality.  We are rightfully trained to make the other guy die for his country.  My 94 year old uncle, still living, left his farm in 1941 to fly P-38's in N Africa during the war, returning to the farm when it ended.  I thank him often.  Though this country seems to be going down an uncertain path vis a vis the economy, immigration, demographics, debt, etc, its more important now than ever to THANK A VET in person while they're still with us.mmigration, demographics, debt, etc, its more important now than ever to THANK A VET in person while they're still with us.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|The latest offering from the crankiest rock star of the '90s, Billy Corgan, may very well be the best he's had to offer in over a decade, but it's been a long and windy road getting there. First, there was the triumphant 2005 announcement of a Pumpkins reunion in the wake of a string of failed side-projects which turned out to merely be Corgan and long-time drummer Jimmy Chamberlain as a two-man band. The two produced and released \\"Zeitgeist\\" in 2007 to lukewarm reception. Almost immediately upon impact, the mainstream rejected it, critics bashed it and fans felt bitter and jaded. It wasn't long before Corgan was lashing out at his audience during the band's troubled 20th anniversary tour and Chamberlain bailed out of the group once and for all, leaving Corgan to his own devices. After years of tinkering around with a massive 44-song album dubbed \\"Teargarden By Kaleidyscope\\" and distributing the first quarter or it online, the bald alt-rock anti-hero finally settled on a line-up and decided it was time to return to the traditional album format. Thus, The Smashing Pumpkins are reborn. Again.<br /><br />It's safe to say that at this point, most people have written Corgan and the Smashing Pumpkins brand off, so it's no surprise that the 13 passages of \\"Oceania\\" strive to prove something to the listener. Whether that \\"something\\" is that Corgan can still rock it like the old days or that the newer, younger band is every bit as competent as the old, classic line-up is completely plausible. One thing is for sure, though: \\"Oceania\\" rocks in ways nobody could have foreseen. Calling to mind the band's debut from nearly 25 years (!) ago, \\"Gish,\\" \\"Oceania\\" is a sprawling rock epic that brings enough showy musicianship and flare to crush any and all indie pretenses. Put frankly, Billy Corgan came here to rock, whether you like it or not. Even on softer, synth-heavy tunes like \\"Violet Rays,\\" where he threatens to \\"kiss anyone tonight,\\" Corgan appears to have a very clear and defined mission.<br /><br />One of the main troubles of \\"Zeitgeist\\" was that it was over-produced and entirely too loud (pre-dating Metallica's bid for Loud War dominance by a year). Thankfully, the sound of \\"Oceania\\" is quite a bit easier on the ears, allowing the dynamics to come through in the mix. That means the bass-licks of Nicole Fiorentino actually matter and serve to define certain moments of the album just as much as D'Arcy did in the \\"Mellon Collie\\" days. Likewise, Chamberlain's replacement, a young drum prodigy by the name of Mike Byrne, is given a spotlight on more than a few occasions, keeping the signature Pumpkins sound alive almost effortlessly. Meanwhile, Corgan and his right-hand man Jeff Schroeder weave in and out of each other without steeping on one another's toes. Nowhere is this chemistry more apparent than on the opening anthem, \\"Quasar.\\" Unlike \\"Zeitgeist\\" which very much felt like Corgan controlling everything, \\"Oceania\\" is a much more organic experience brought to life by a real band with personality and chops to boot.<br /><br />While there may be no radio-hits ala \\"Today\\" or \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" to propel \\"Oceania\\" into the pop-culture stratosphere, it's likely to win back a lot of burnt-out fans and prove a lot of critics wrong. As one of the few alt-rockers with a genuine appreciation and understanding of his instrument, it's inspiring to hear Corgan playing nice with his band-mates for once. \\"Oceania\\" is everything a Pumpkins album should be; it's focused, balanced, organic and mostly importantly:  it flat-out rocks. If you think you've already heard all the classics Corgan has to offer, think again.

B00881VLCE|5.0|Works great on kindle fire. Pics are vibrant and there are several to choose from. Now I can take my love of puzzles on the go. Love it!!
B0086700CM|4.0|The game itself is awesome.  Who doesn't like temple run?  However, sometimes the app is choppy, freezes, or in unresponsive.  I'm sure a small update will easily take care of these things.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fantastic and works wonders for kindle fires. I highly recommend this FREE game, and no you don't have to pay for things with real money. You're welcome to spend money when you could just work to get it. Anyways, It didn't freeze or slow down not once on my KINDLE FIRE, I advise you try the FREE game before deciding its useless, actually its rather addicting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application is amazing!  Very easy to use, and has become my daily reader!  Thank you and keep the goods coming!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app...lots of entertainment and challenge. even though most of the games are locked it is a challenge to unlock them
B005ZUR724|5.0|great mmo rpg for a tablet.  don't compare it to wow because this is not on a Pc.  gameloft did a great job with this game.  thank you gameloft.  would like to see more classes soon we hope :)
B0081L37Z0|1.0|If you're like me, you're sick and tired of Hollywood turning a perfectly good series that you watched as a kid, which actually had some moral lessons in there once in awhile, a touch of really good drama and acting and some action and then turn it into a cesspool of stupidity and lack of morals.  It kind of disturbed me that the main characters actually end up taking drugs to appease the drug dealer in the movie and end up tripping something fierce and then they throw a party serving alcohol and drugs to minors.  Through the whole movie, I was thinking...yeah, right these guys are supposed to be cops!  These guys are supposed to be solving a crime and they are getting involved in the crime? It would have been more inventive if the writer of the script found ways for the characters to get out of the situations.  I would not recommend your children / teens watch this movie unless you plan on them imitating some of what was in the film.  That said there were some pretty funny parts of the movie...but at what cost?
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app so much! The little monster om nom is the cutest thing ever. If you are reluctant to pay for apps because there are plenty that you can get for free then i would still advise getting this because it is absolutely addicting. I could spend all day playing cut the rope!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Really has everything you need. Really easy to navigate and has a great flow. I use it on my Kindle Fire and obviously having a gps. would be great but obviously that's not the apps fault.
B004UID2LC|4.0|it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't. when u download it, sometimes after it gets to a 100% it will just act lime it just forgot about the download..its weird,  but the songs e entually end up there it just take a month... and sometimes it tells me its &quot;not responding &quot;.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|A must have...extremely user friendly, and I love that I can sync my calendar with my Android phone so that I never miss an appointment or a scheduled task. In my opinion, this app is a 'must have' for anyone with a busy life to stay productive and organized.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was distubring, frightening, infuriating, and stomach-turning all at different times throughout.  Which is everything it should have been and every reason why I couldn't put it down.  The twists and turns are chaotic and amazingly suprising.  This was the kind of book that you get to the last pages and want to put it down just to sustain being able to read it a little bit longer.  I can't wait to check out everything else Gillian Flynn has available, and I will.
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|I bought an early release of this album on June 21st, so I have had enough time to let this album sink and this is easily a great new album from the Offspring. is it perfect? no, but I think it is far above what a lot of reviewers rate. I have come to realize through various internet reviews that there are 2 main extreme negative types of complaints about the Offspring's new album.<br /><br />1.) The people that are personally offended, angered and \\"totally done with the Offspring forever man!!\\" because of Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk) and OC Guns.<br />2.) The people that hate it because \\"who cares? sounds like all the other stuff they ever did.\\"<br /><br />I am going to disregard those 2 jaded, childish views and rate this song by song based on the way I have come to perceive the Offspring over the years.<br /><br />1.)The Future Is Now-When I first popped the disc in, this song was a great intro to the album. High energy, In your face politically charged lyrics and powerful instruments. Yes, it does sound like some Rise Against song(thanks youtube!), but one big difference. I like Dexter's voice. I cannot stand Tim McIlrath's voice. As for this song, it is still good, nowhere near the best on the disc, but good opener. It kind of grew off me after a few listens and flatlined. good, but not great. maybe it will un-flatline with time (3/5)<br /><br />2.)Secrets From the Underground - Maintains a lot of the serious tone and energy of the first song, however this one has more replay value and is more interesting to me. I feel that this one could easily fit in on Conspiracy Of One or Rise and Fall Rage and Grace. Once again it is pretty good, but not the best one the album. Could still grow on me more possibly. (3.5/5)<br /><br />3.)Days Go By - The lead single from which the album is named after. It is a good song, with a pretty boring music video. At this point in the Offspring's mainstream career, it is hard not to expect a song like this to pop up.  The song had to grow on me once again. Its a keeper though (3.5/5)<br /><br />4.)Turning Into You - Its hard not to be reminded of Rise Against on this song when Dexter starts singing. The chorus is strong and I feel it saves the song from being a mediocre halt. Sounds like a song from their stagnant Splinter album. Not horrible, but one of the lesser songs on this album.(2.75/5)<br /><br />5.)Hurting As One - Now this is where the album starts picking up a lot. This is the first song on this album that I could comfortably call a punk song. Sounds like Smash/Ixnay era. no joke! If Gone Away and Something To Believe in had a child, it would be this song. It is great to see something like this wash away the stagnancy of the previous track. This song shows us the still great punk band hiding under the mainstream rock band they have morphed into. By the end of this song, I'm excited for the rest of the album! Maybe there are more surprises to follow, eh? (5/5)<br /><br />6.)Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk) - Now this is where I completely disconnect from most of the popular opinion. I completely understand that this is a satirical song poking fun at the abysmal mainstream pop radio. This is the light-hearted pop punk Offspring that made Pretty Fly and Want You Bad. It sounds like the classic pop punk Offspring of the late 90's/early 2000's musically. Also, this song is strategically placed to break up the monotonous \\"serious\\" tone of the album. If you take this one seriously, the joke's on you.(4/5)<br /><br />7.)All I Have Left Is You - Sloooooow song time, but I don't hate slow songs done by certain bands and genres of music. The thing is, the Offspring aren't great at slow, sappy ballads like this. If you liked Fix You from the last album, this may be your thing. To be fair, the song picks up some steam and starts getting good as it gets louder and the lyrics are touching, but to me this is one of the lesser tracks.(2.5/5)<br /><br />8.)OC Guns - Another California song. This one deserves Cruising California's criticisms. An obvious joke song. A reggae/ska-ish song. Fun to hear once. Low point of the album. Rating is for these guys giving reggae/ska a shot. (2/5)<br /><br />9.)Dirty Magic - Re-working of the classic Ignition track. sounds similar, except backing vocals in the chorus. Still as excellent as it has always been. Great to hear a classic. (5/5)<br /><br />10.)Secret Family - pop punk song. pretty good, but not great. sounds like a Rise and Fall Rage and Grace outtake. (3/5)<br /><br />11.)Dividing By Zero - Yes! back to classic badass Offspring. You can hear some Americana mixed with self-titled Offspring in this one. Fast, quick, and to the point.  More like this! (5/5)<br /><br />12.)Slim Pickens - Last song and they end it with a bang! This and the previous track are the best tracks on this album. This was the Offspring I wanted to have on the entire album right here. This is a definite song that could have come from Americana. Superb ending! (5/5)<br /><br />All in all, the album itself is easily the best since Conspiracy of One since it is the first since that album to actually give us a glimpse of that great hard rocking punk band that released all those classics in the 90's. While it is not perfect, it is definitely better than the 2003 trainwreck called Splinter and the pretty good, but not great Rise and Fall album. over half of the album is easily worth owning if your a fan of punk or 90's alternative. Let's hope that their next album is More Slim Pickens, Dividing By Zero, Hurting As One and Less Turning Into you and Future is now.

B006RUJST6|4.0|Many books in this genre focus on the supernatural, supplemented by recycled plot lines. In the beginning of the story you find that the main character, Layken, is moving with her mother and brother because her father has died. Pleasantly, this book was not about how much Layken hated her mother or having a romance without her now single-parent's knowledge. The dynamic between Layken and her family demonstrates a well thought out basis for this story. I enjoyed the strong ties between the characters.<br /><br />Layken finds a new friend and they have more in common than she would have ever anticipated. Their connection, while quick, was realistic enough to support the story.<br /><br />My only hangup was the abrupt ending of the story; otherwise, it was a quick and enjoyable read.

B002HFP0QU|5.0|Shortly before Robin passed away, I set out to collect everything Bee Gees I could get my hands on, and started with this.  A lot of great reviews, which I won't try to duplicate.  Just to say this is the best survey of Bee Gees music you're going to find anywhere.  No, it doesn't replace the separate albums, especially the pre-Stayin' Alive days.  But a very good reminder of how talented they were, what great songs they cranked out, and a very  good starting place for anyone wanting to fall back in love with one of the hardest working groups or musicians and entertainers around.  When everyone else was fading and losing stream, they kept on going right past mean spirited dee-jays and music business guys, past their top 40 shelf life, and right on into history as one of the longest lasting working bands in music history.  I've gone on to purchase just about every album they released.  Not a bum song on the set.  If you want a greatest hits set, this one is it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|IT is a great app. I really enjoy playing it with my daughter and my son. I would like it if it was easier to get acorns.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the movie first, and got interested in the story. I knew books always have more information than movies about what they are thinking and why something is happening. The book is a clear and detailed story, and very enjoyable reading. I read it on the Kindle app on my Droid 2. I also appreciated being able to go right into the second and third books without interruption.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" is a historical action drama film set in the mid-19th century.<br /><br />The narrative captures a time in American History where the streets of New York were essentially ruled by criminal mobs, and the hostile environment of the time is brought to life with eye-catching set and costume design.<br /><br />There are several themes presented by the story, which includes: calculated vengeance, displacement due to personal loss, and attempts to seek order in amongst the mayhem.<br /><br />The movie doesn't hold back with fierceness, and this is used as a means to convey the harshness of the story events and time period.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I, finally, bought the book just to see what all the fuss was about. I still do not know.  Monotonous... superficial... boring... and after a few chapters...not sexy... not sexy... not sexy... just the opposite, for me.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|Not only is this album amazing, but it also came earlier than I expected. It was well worth the price. For the past week, I haven't listened to anything other than What We Saw From the Cheap Seats. Honestly, it is kind of depressing, but Regina is an amazing song writer.
0765350386|3.0|First of all, I must say this book has led me to hate the word \\"maladroitly.\\" Really? Maladroitly? If it's a mouthful verbally, it's going to make my reading brain stumble too.<br /><br />I've been reading (and rereading..and rereading) WOT by Robert Jordan since I was but a wee pup. When I found out that this author I'd never heard of was going to be finishing the series, I was extremely skeptical. However, the two books that have been published under his influence were fine - I was surprisingly pleased with the results. Can't wait until January for the culmination of my 13 yr journey with Jordan's amazing epic.<br /><br />So I picked up Sanderson's book Elantris, which felt strange because most fantasy novels come in multiples. But I liked it. I couldn't wait to find out what happened at the end.<br /><br />So then I bought the Mistborn Trilogy.<br /><br />This first book was very, very difficult for me to get into. Having read Jordan and also GRRM, the characters in this book are extremely shallow - especially the minor ones (everyone but Vin and Kelsier). But I pushed through, because I'm type A when it comes to reading, and I can't NOT finish a book even if I hate it. And I didn't hate this, it just was boring. Sorry Sanderson. I'm trying to like you.<br /><br />Yes the magic system is original and imaginative, but quite complicated. The noble politics were shallow. Action was hard to follow with all the Pushing and Pulling and Coinshots and Thugs and Trolls..wait, no trolls. Maybe trolls would be better?<br /><br />To sum it up, I will never use maladroitly in a sentence, verbal or otherwise, and I would not recommend this series to someone used to engaging, entertaining, mindblowing fantasy.
0316123587|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter's birthday and had it shipped to New Zealand.  She absolutely loved it as she is a Glee freak and it wasnt yet available over here.
0307719219|3.0|\\"Why Nations Fail\\" is a detailed view of the history of the world and the national, cultural, political and other circumstances that either formed a successful country or caused some form of collapse within the country.<br />When you read the praise for this book prior to the title page, you will see a lot of positive feedback much of it from Nobel laureates who simply love the book. Unfortunately, I think that that is precisely the audience the authors are aiming towrd.<br />Not being one of those, I found the book to meander through history with the authors trying to put their points across in often excruciating detail with a bit too much time spent on very early history and not enough on helping to understand current environments.<br />One definitely needs a strong academic bent to completely appreciate this \\"thesis\\" that uses \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" as a background basis for bringing certain theories into the 21st century but it takes a strong constitution to get past the heavy amount of detail used by Acemoglu and Robinson.<br />So if you are ready to absorb history in a rather cold exposition and your intent is to become an expert in world history, you would probably absorb the complexity of \\"Why Nations Fail\\".<br />I simply felt it didn't bring enough insight to our current world environment to hold my complete interest.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game but some of the games I don't get because this game does not have any directions!!!
0307959856|1.0|I like PD James and I like Jane Austen, but this is one terrible piece of drivel.  Boring, unoriginal, and poorly written; this story is not worth the paper it's written on.  I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't been stuck on a ten hour flight.  What was she thinking?
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. Well done for the Kindle Fire. I am pretty impressed with the responsiveness of the system, the among of time I have spent, and the replayability.
1400052181|5.0|This is a very good book, but I do wish I had gone into it with a better understanding of the science of human cells. The story not only expands upon the history of Henrietta Lacks' unknowing, but phenomenal contribution to science, and her family's painful discovery of this, but also describes many experiences that poor, black people suffered in the mid 1900's in the name of science. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and tells the story in a very human way.  It can really leave your head spinning and brings up some serious ethical issues regarding how all of us do contribute, knowingly or unknowingly, to science.

B003ZFVI8U|5.0|I started listening to Clutch when Transnational came out.  I loved that album.  When self titled came out, I almost gave up on them.  It was such a departure from speedway league that I thought it wasnt the same band.  Little did I know, they would evolve on each album.  They improve their sound for each album, and you know what  -  IT WORKS.  My favorite songs are still the earlier heavy ones like Far country, Shogun, Binge and Purge and Impetus, but as I have gotten older I appreciate all of their songs now.  When you see songs like Burning Beard, Mice and Gods and 10001110101 live you will understand what I mean.  Even though I love all Clutch albums, this has become my favorite.
B00122LUXQ|5.0|For those of You who don't know like the commentator above:<br />Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 - December 26, 1999) was an African-American soul, R&B, and funk singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known for his anthemic music with The Impressions during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and for composing the soundtrack to the blaxploitation film Super Fly; Mayfield is Highly Regarded as a pioneer of funk and of politically conscious African-American music. He was also a multi-instrumentalist who played the guitar, bass, piano, saxophone, and drums. Curtis Mayfield is a winner of both the Grammy Legend Award (in 1994) and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (in 1995), and was a double inductee into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted as a member of The Impressions into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and again in 1999 as a solo artist. He is also a two-time Grammy Hall of Fame inductee....Yeah, He's a Household name alright, and that's an understatement, because He Was and Still Is so much more...Another Legend who went by the name of Jimi Hendrix idolized Curtis Mayfield. Enough said.

055380684X|5.0|Some learned reviewers complain about this book's allegedly shallow treatment of seriously researched science as if the book is taking a free-ride on the back of more worthy efforts; I think they miss the point. This book's function is to bring this research to the attention of a wider audience. These findings are important knowledge as they show that the \\"feel good\\", \\"soft option\\" approaches to education that have dominated since the 1970s are misguided and are \\"dumbing down\\" society. Having read this book people can move onto the deeper tomes.

1400064287|4.0|Of the book itself: It was easy to read and can be read through in about 4 hours.<br /><br />I won't summarize the points of the book (the way that has been done in the hundreds of other reviews posted here), nor try to critique the authors prose/ presentation (see earlier parenthetical insert). Instead I'll try to address some of the questions that came up during the reading (that were not answered by the authors):<br /><br />1. Can all subjects be treated this way? I just can't imagine a Professor of Chemistry trying to treat Sn1 and Sn2 reactivity according to the schema that the authors developed over the 250 pages of text. Is there a way to do that? And if there isn't a way to do it, does it mean that the idea is not worthwhile?<br /><br />2. What happens when you have a person who uses their power of making ideas \\"sticky\\" for bad purposes? No small talent of people who have done a lot of dirt (think of various despots) has been in their ability to appopriate symbols and create narratives that people can believe. Hitler's warrior state. Mao's Great Leap Forward. (The authors here talked about JFK's goal of \\"putting a man on the moon within X years.\\" Well, the news is that Mao wanted to overtake Britain in steel production in X years. Great, concrete image. Disastrous results and a huge number of lost lives.)<br /><br />3. Was this book for marketing execs? Or teachers? Or just some generalized person somewhere that needed to make some idea stick?<br /><br />4. These guys are academics (psychology professors). A lot of people believe things in Psychology for some amount of time and then.... just..... don't. (It's hard to know what is real and what is not in Psychology.) But if these authors are onto something that is real and authenticated knowledge, then why are they giving away something basically for free in books that they could be selling as a marketing firm or as consultants?<br /><br />5. Ok. So an idea needs to be concrete and simple. Was there anyone that talks to people for a living that didn't know that? Was it necessary for a 250 page expansion of said information?<br /><br />6.

1400032717|5.0|I had to get this book for a college class, and loved it. It even gave me a deeper view on the autistic child. I just couldn't let go of the book. Even my best friend that doesn't like to read much books loved it. She couldn't stop reading it either. Required book or not it is a great book to read, and it actually does give a good insight on the views of an autistic child.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing all the buzz about this trilogy, I was sufficiently interested to purchase the books. I have read the first book and I am reading the second. I am incredulous about the hype. My conclusion about the popularity of these books is that they give the reader a chance to read pornography \\"legally\\", that is, without the usual stigma society applies to this genre of writing.<br /><br />The book is not written well in terms of technical or reality based content. It is infrequent that I read a book that contains so much repitition. It seems to be the work of an inexperienced writer. But, oh does it contain sex! On almost every page we get to know the intimacies and fetishes of the main characters. This book must be supplying the general sector of readers with a chance to be able to read pornography under the pretense that it is okay because it is a best seller.<br /><br />If you read this book please understand that it is not a well written book. The repetition is rather ridiculous. The level of reading, if not for the content seems juvenile. If you are looking for sanctioned pornography, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />I want people to be able to read any content they desire. I am disappointed, after all the hype, with the lack of literary skill evidenced in these books. On the other hand, I am happy for the readers enjoying the trilogy.
B0076NKNLA|3.0|The movie was okay, kind of dull at times, essentially nothing really happens. I think Michelle Williams did a pretty good portrayal of Marilyn Monroe, afterall I think it would be difficult to completely capture the screen presence and charisma that Marilyn had. There was something missing though...<br /><br />I am rather skeptical that this week happened at all though, it sounds like a rather fanciful account from a young man. I'm not sure why Marilyn Monroe would have any interest in a third assistant director when she was just married 3 weeks, was pregnant, and had a constant retinue of people around her.<br /><br />This is an account of a \\"previously unknown chapter of Marilyn's life\\"....but maybe it's unknown because it didn't happen? I have read though that she was known to be difficult to work with, was frequently late, and heavily dependent on Paula Strausberg - and that is depicted in the movie.<br /><br />I do not think Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh were portrayed well or even realistically in this movie, the casting was really off on them!

B007L3BMGA|2.0|Everyone from my 65 year old mother, to the lady next to me on an airplane asked if I read this book.  Intrigued, I downloaded it, and was amazed it has received so much popularity!  The writing style reminded me of a teenager.  \\"She bites her bottom lip.\\"  \\"He murmured, she murmured, murmur murmur murmur....\\"  Much of the same throughout the book, poorly written in my opinion, author could have used a thesaurus!  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one, is that I did finish it, so it obviously held my interest long enough to complete it.  The prose seemed repetitive and slightly unimaginative, although perhaps my expectation were far too high.  I will not be reading the second or third parts.
B00899DR40|5.0|I always thought Bieber was a very talented guy, I liked his songs but they did have a younger vibe. I had high expectations for this album but he managed to surpass them. His new album is amazing! I'm a senior in college and I don't think I've gotten a CD and there be so many songs on it that I love. There is such a great variety and mix. Every time I hear it, which is a lot, it just keeps getting better. Great CD. Great music!
B005N7CA3A|5.0|...Which is rare. Usually, I have to listen to something numerous times to really start to pick up on why a song is so great. Well, put this cd on while doing dishes and I'm scrubbing away, and just thinking,\\"Wow...\\" as I'm feeling totally moved inside. I was iffy about this cd, because I wasn't blown away by Darren's last cd, and  \\"Tension and the Spark,\\" had a lot of good songs on, but just didn't stir me up emotionally like Darren's past work...like Savage Garden's \\"Affirmation.\\" The \\"Animal Song,\\" is okay in my opinion, but there will never be another cd as perfect as \\"Affirmation.\\" (The last couple of tracks on that cd are ESPECIALLY amazing.) Not too many cds go from mourning a lost love, to a song about living through domestic violence as a child, to a song about dying and moving towards the Other Side, to being completely turned off of companionship and romance, and finishes with a song about reconnecting a friendship that ended badly.<br /><br />  So if you were someone who enjoyed Darren's SG work and even \\"Spin\\" more than his past couple of cds, you need to get this. I'm sort of upset it took me so long to get this. I REALLY FEEL LIKE,\\"HOW DID I GO SO LONG WITHOUT THIS?!?\\" I KNOW for certain this cd is going to enjoy many playthroughs, without having to skip ahead to certain tracks, with me for a long time.<br /><br />  Remember, how I said above \\"Affirmation\\" will never be beat in how perfect it is...Well, this cd just might be up there with it or come close. GET THIS CD!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Sex sex sex and kinky sex.  After a while the whole thing got very boring.  You can pretty much tell how this will end even without reading the whole series.  But,  i guess by the way these books are selling that I am In the minority.  If you need to spice up your sex life this would be a good read.
0425263908|4.0|Having read the \\"50 Shades Trilogy\\", I can't really see a whole lot of comparison with this book. Maybe, there being a lot of explicit sex in the book, and a totally mentally screwed up couple, is what makes them so similar. The main characters have issues with their troubled  childhoods (being sexual abused), and the supporting characters seem to have equal issues. The whole book is a mental mess, but very absorbing. It's one of those reads that is hard to put down, just wondering if these characters are ever going to work out all this inner turmoil. It has some mysterious bad guys, that haven't been explained yet, in this book, so will keep you moving on to the next installment in October.  I,for one, have pre-ordered it, as the story is quite intriguing.

1604591625|4.0|Unlike many books on apologetics, Chesterton does not present carefully crafted arguments using e logical method. Instead he examines the paradoxes and everyday experiences of life and claims that Christianity better explains life than alternate worldviews. His ideas are more a collections of life's observations rather than a carefully crafted polemic. Chesterton does have a flair for language and uses many analogies to illustrate his points. If you are looking for a book to quote there are many good quotable points in this book. Note that the title of the book is orthodoxy but don't expect very much defense of any specific orthodox Christian doctrine. This is more of a general apologetic with a well-written and very literary style

B003B02PEU|5.0|Always a big fan of Grisham.  As is typical for him he speaks in the first person, but in the role of a lawyer.  In this case he is a journalist.  A dropout from a private northern university, he picks up a gig as an intern/apprentice for a small town weekly paper.  Because of his background, he is not easily embraced by the locals.  He eventually accepts his name as `Willie'.<br />Be patient, he often shifts from storyline to personal details.  Caution to the reader: these details are important to the storyline.<br />Taking place in the 70s, the theme addresses Civil Rights and its impact upon the Deep South.<br />Beginning with a murder and the subsequent trial, the main plot deals with the aftermath of a lenient sentence.  The sentence is believed to be the product of a powerful family of the defendant, which is at best on the margins of the local society.  The murderer is paroled far too early and the events that follow traumatize the town.  As threatened by the murderer, the jurors are, one-by-one being bumped off.<br />Even though the story appears to be about the murder, murderer, and the victims, it is really about the personal development of Willie.  The identity of the person responsible is left almost to the end.  The true ending however, is Willie's soliloquy about what he must do.

B007L6VR12|5.0|IN A WORLD WHERE films must shock, where films must employ impossible stunts, extreme violence and outrageous characters, comes Moonrise Kingdom - with none of it. This is a real STORY, with real characters, in which everything that happens is actually possible. What a concept. Told with humor and compassion, the film sweeps you along without the dreaded need for suspension of disbelief. The story is pure Americana - life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Some do it better than others. Not everyone is a winner. Its stars - seven of them! - are all totally out of character. This is not a Bill Murray vehicle or an Edward Norton vehicle or a Bruce Willis vehicle. The stars fit in, almost as afterthoughts. It's the story that counts. Most impressively, it has style. From the opening shots of Susie, face on with her binoculars in various rooms of the house, you know this film will be stylish. And understated. It is worthy of any screen in the world, in a world where American films have become overpoweringly boring and repetitive and entirely predictable. This is the kind of film that France would have originated, and which Americans would have remade into a noxious overkill of action and adventure. It is therefore rare and precious. It will endure long after Transformers XXVII has faded. Kudos to Wes Anderson and team for resisting the urges that every other Hollywood production takes for a granted as a requirement. Bob Balaban as the narrator, making his own appearance in the story, is inspired, as is his framing in the shots. That kind of attention to style gives Moonrise Kingdom the ability to sweep you away. On these shores, this is the first must see in years.

B00012QM8G|5.0|It is said in the Talmud, the central text for Judaic law and ethics, that whoever saves one life saves the world entire. That is certainly true of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who defied the Nazis to save the lives of 1,200 Jews. But as \\"Schindler's List\\" tells us, he was not always morally compassionate for the Jews.<br /> Schindler saw putting Jews to work in his factory as more of a \\"Well, I can't make money any other way. But I can protect them from Hitler.\\" He wore a swastika on his jacket only to gain respect and profits from the Nazi party. You can say that by wearing a swastika and receiving benefits from the Nazis, Schindler was himself a Nazi. But it also comes down to the fact that he didn't bring harm to the Jews. Steven Spielberg, the director of \\"Schindler's List\\", has said that Schindler was less of a Nazi in his heart. He was just a greedy businessman who saw the Jews as a way to make money, and only later did he come to care for the Jews.<br /> I'm sure that most people back in 1993 were shocked that Spielberg made this movie with the amount of violence that it shows and offers. In previous pictures such as \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\", Spielberg cut the Nazis down into treasure hunters and less of what they really were. But in \\"Schindler's List\\", he shows us the true meaning of a Nazi. Most of them were faceless soldiers who mercilessly massacred not just Jews, but millions of other innocent human beings. Now why I do say most? Weren't all the Nazis savage animals?<br /> History has showed us time and time again that within a large army of animalistic humans, there is always at least one person who knows what's right. Schindler was that morally incorruptible being. Spielberg shows us that his turning point in the film is the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto, where he witnesses on horseback the gathering up of Jews to be sent away to the Nazi death camps. He begins to feel compassion for people who could not defend themselves, and he knew what he had to do.<br /> It is Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler that was most satisfying about the character. Schindler had already been adapted for the screen incredibly well, and Neeson was the human link that made the performance great, if not brilliant.<br /> The Nazis, particularly Amon Goeth (in a remarkable performance by Ralph Fiennes), were selfish, malevolent beings who sought world conquest and the destruction of people who were different. Spielberg shows us that they loved murdering innocent people. They got great pleasure in doing it. If it had been any other way, \\"Schindler's List\\" would have been an example of a Holocaust parody.<br /> One notable performance that is consistently overlooked is by Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant whom Schindler recruits to be his right hand man. Stern criticizes Schindler at multiple moments in the film. He believes that some of Schindler's tactics are not successful in rescuing human beings. At other times, he praises Schindler for being incorruptible and willing to risk his own life to save hundreds of others.<br /> Another key element of \\"Schindler's List\\" is the violence of the picture. Spielberg doesn't turn the violence and hatred into things of fantasy. He shows people being shot in the back of the head, being incinerated, and being lead to what seems to be the gas chambers (water comes out miraculously instead of gas). As I stated before, the Nazis took great pleasure in killing Jews.<br /> I saw the film again today for the second time in my life, and this time around I remembered why I love this film so much. Seeing it again, I examined \\"Schindler's List\\" as a film that preserves history. Spielberg brings together all of his resources and all the \\"Schindler Jews\\" that he could to get the story straight and accurate. If he had followed a path that lead to generic melodrama, it would have been extremely offensive. (But he obviously knew that.)<br /> At the end of the movie, we are shown the second shots of color (the first being the very beginning of the film with a family celebrating the Sabbath) as we see the \\"Schindler Jews\\" in present-day place rocks on Schindler's grave. We see each of their names as they place the rocks on the grave. The last shot of the movie is of Liam Neeson standing over Schindler's grave. It's a powerful sight.<br /> But examining \\"Schindler's List\\" for the second time, I began to think about the detractors of the movie. Claude Lanzmann, the director of the 9 ½ hour documentary \\"Shoah\\", called \\"Schindler's List\\" a kitschy melodrama and a deformation of the truth, as he wanted to be the only voice in the true account of the Holocaust. The claim he made is extraordinarily inappropriate and offensive. Anyone who wants to show the Holocaust truthfully should be allowed to, and Spielberg pulled it off.<br /> Stanley Kubrick has said that \\"the Holocaust was about 6 million Jews who got killed. \\"Schindler's List\\" is about 600 who don't.\\" In truth, \\"Schindler's List\\" uses the Holocaust as a basis for the story. Roger Ebert has said that the film is about character studies, in terms of Oskar Schindler and Amon Goeth, and he is right. If the film had been about the Holocaust, I don't think that Schindler's name would have even been brought up. As much as I admire the films of Stanley Kubrick, I must say that he was flat-out wrong in terms of \\"Schindler's List.\\"<br /> So what is the movie about? If I were asked to answer that question, I would say that \\"Schindler's List\\" is about defying the greatest of all evil in the greatest of all perils. It is not about the Holocaust. It is one man's story, and continues to be.<br /> As far as the movie goes, \\"Schindler's List\\" is absolute good.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|Needed to replace a 20+ year old Yamaha 'keyboard' mixer for a home studio due to bad contacts I didn't feel like trying to fix and this is a wonderful, compact 10-channel mixer (it's called \\"8-input,\\" but is technically 2 mono input + 2 stereo input (6-channel), but also has stereo aux return + stereo 'CD/tape' input, so unless you need to use FX send/return and/or other source monitoring, it's 2 mono + 4 stereo (w/ EQ only available on 2 mono + 2 stereo) inputs).  Yeah, the old Yamaha mixer had built-in stereo chorus effect on 4 channels, but most modern keyboards and other equipment already have their own stereo output, plus this has XLR connections for the 2 mono inputs for a more 'pro' microphone connection.  It's very compact for the features and seems very rugged and high quality.  I had considered the similar Alesis mixer, but after comparing them, this seemed like a better buy and I'm not at all unhappy w/ my decision.  I only wish there were an on/off switch rather than having to unplug it when not in use.

0307956350|2.0|I excitedly anticipated getting my hands on The Expat by Chris Pavone.  A well reviewed first novel from an author with an interesting pedigree and a strong female protagonist in an espionage thriller sounded like just the thing to add to my summer reading list. The protagonist, Kate, is a former CIA operative who has given up the excitement of life in the field for comforts of home, husband and children.  She has however neglected to tell her husband Dexter about her secret life.  When she finds he too may have sinister secrets she uses her skills as an operative to learn a version of the truth. It sounds great. I was, however, immediately disappointed with The Expats.  The numerous time shifts explaining back story and character actions were confusing.  Showing these things through dialogue would have been much more effective and smoothing out the timeline would make for a much more readable narrative. Perhaps the most disturbing, even jarring aspect of this work is the overly wordy nature of the prose.  I found myself thinking the author was trying to impress by showing how many arcane or multisyllabic words he knew or was trying for the world record in sentence length. Other reviewers have given examples of this tendency in The Expat and I found it immediately annoying. It necessitated reading and rereading to find out what the author was actually saying. I could not decide if the male author felt this overboard composition was the way women think, as the protagonist is female or he was just showing off.<br />The plot of The Expats ,as expected, was complex. There were many twists and turns.  Most were predicable, however, masked in the above referenced wordy prose.  The book could be a page-turner on the strength of the plot and its many twists but the writing style detracted from this powerful aspect of the story. The convoluted plot is made clear only in the final chapter with the tried and true method used by Hercule Perriot and others.  The main characters are assembled, review the evidence to reveal the true master criminal.  As a tense thriller The Expats fails to launch as its conclusion is obvious early in the second act and tricking the archvillian into revealing dialogue is a tired mystery device.<br />Where the story does excel however is conveying a feeling of alienation, the personal baggage of deceit and the toll secrets take on a person and a relationship.  This is a story with many layers. The setting and plot contribute to the overall alienation of the protagonist and help the reader understand her story. Unfortunately The Expats falls short mired in its own words.are assembled, review the evidence to reveal the true master criminal.

B007XF0VW2|1.0|The movie only edition has one special feature and no extended cut. Better off buying the other blu ray version that has the extended cut along with a dvd copy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best in the hole world it is very inerestering and fun cause it never ends yes!!!!!!!!'
B0086700CM|5.0|it's addicting and its exciting, imangi studios did a great job on this exciting game, and I would recommend this to a friend.
0307887448|5.0|I just finished reading Ready Player One and absolutely loved it. The book is a definite departure from anything I've read, probably since Cormac McCarthy's [[ASIN:0307387895 The Road (Oprah's Book Club)]]. I really enjoyed both of these immensely.<br />Ready Player One follows the story of Wade, aka his avatar Parzival, a video game playing nerd who spends most of his life in the Oasis, a virtual world of the future. Young Wade, like many of his peers, spends more time in the Oasis than in real life, since in the Oasis he's not an unpopular and poor nerd, but a somewhat powerful virtual being.<br />Parzival then undergoes a quest for treasure, that takes him on many twists and turns, including falling in love with another avatar whom he's never actually met in real life. The book contains tons of references to movies, video games, computers, and television shows from years ago. Some of these had previously been lost in the back reaches of my memory, like the old Ultraman Japanese TV show.<br />If you were a computer and video-game playing nerd like me, then you will love this book. It's a fast, fun read that is completely unexpected. I look forward to a movie adaptation.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This was very relaxing and enjoyable.  The Colorado graphics of the puzzles are sharp.  I hope there will be more picture puzzles to come.
0345803485|1.0|If I could have given it 0 stars I would have.<br /><br />This series of books (all three) was given to me as a gift from my mother-in-law.  I'm 125 pages in to book one and I don't even know why I bothered to read as much as I have.  The writing is trite, the characters are inconsistent, one-dimensional, unrealistic and uninteresting.  The author has already repeated many of the same discriptions over and over.<br /><br />My main concern now is what to tell my MIL if she asks me how I liked the books.  Do I tell her the truth and risk offending her or do I lie and risk getting more gifts like this in the future?
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This album in a way is a return to form. Don't get me wrong, I think every Linkin Park album is very good. But, the band did start to experiment on the last two albums. For those of you who expect Hybrid Theory part two you need to grow up. It's not 2000 anymore and times and people have changed. All my favorite bands from the 1990's that are still around sound different. Life changes and you have to except that. That being said this a really solid album. Mike and Chester are back with their excellent word play. For those of you who don't like it you probably didnt give it enough of a chance. Listen to it from start to finish and have an open mind. Remember it's 2012 and not 2000.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is the best game. if u like Mario u would like leps world. it is awesome . get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B0017I1IZA|5.0|This is the first e-book I've purchased on my new kindle and not only do I love the book (as I always do with Janet Evanovich) but the e-book experience has also been great.  I just wish it was a bit more \\"cost effective\\" the e-book cost me the exact same as the paperback would have at B&N.
0143120255|5.0|I've lived in New York City for many years, and have been privileged to do business and tour Paris many times -- perhaps 500 miles of walking through her storied streets. Most recently, a new and very dear friend spent six days over last Christmas sampling her treasures once again.<br /><br />This book is a beautiful reminder of the beauties of both cities, charming on the coffee table or in the bathroom.<br /><br />It is often updated on the website of the authors, Google the name of the book to find the treasures there.<br /><br />&#34;Paris vs New York, a tally of two cities.<br />Un match visuel amical entre ces deux villes, c'est le regard d'un amoureux de Paris sur un New York rempli de d&eacute;tails, de clich&eacute;s et de contradictions : suivez le guide.<br />A friendly visual match between two cities told by a lover of Paris wandering through NewYork.

B0086700CM|5.0|i admit, this game does lag a bit but only when i first got the game. as i went along, the lag stopped. it's a really fun game, but i do admit after playing for a few days it gets... old. although i don't play it as often as i used to, it's a very fun game to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is super fun but after a certain time it is hard to unlock new games and i am only writing this to get points for new games
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I love this cd so much.  In my opinion this is her best ever, and I can't quit listening to it.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|this game is REALLY fun, but after a while it can get kinda boring. i dont like how zen mode is so easy. my brothers and i have high score competitions. they love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book because everybody is talking about it so I wanted to see what the big hype is about.  And after reading it, I don't get it.  There is no story here!  A girl loses her virginity to a dominant rich man and they fall in love. Big whoop!  There was no climax to this story. I'm not sure how a publisher even took time to read the first 10 sentences. Reading this book and seeing the popularity of it, makes me think I can get my 8 year old twins to write a book and become millionaires!
B0086700CM|5.0|I loveeeee this app. this was the first app i got on my kindle fire. ive only had it fir a week or two and ive already played it like foue hundred times.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Damn I loved this book!!! I read it in 2 days!!!! It was literally hard to put down. I know my bf loves me, but damn did Travis love Abby and I wish my bf said half the things Travis said to her, to me. This book will have u anxious and have ur heart racing so fast at times with all the twist and turns and heart stopping moments. It will even make u cry. Ur main focused would be to get to the happy ending (which there is btw). I would definitely read this again.  MUST READ PPL!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is great. I like playing it and I recommend to everybody who likes apps that can be endless.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I can't remember the last review I have submitted. However, this book made me want to take the time to express how much I enjoyed it. Great story, pace is excellent, the bar has been set very high for the next book.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|read the book in about 8 hours loved it, i cant wait 2 start. will be in touch mike. thank you
B008BYXQJY|3.0|Here's my two cents. This is not a bad album. But it's not \\"Songs About Jane\\". It reminds me of David Guetta: music with catchy beats and repetitive lyrics. Which is not always a bad thing. Songs like \\"Ladykiller\\", \\"Sad\\" and \\"Daylight\\" are close to the usual M5 style. But most of the songs are kinda like dance songs. Now, if you don't like \\"Payphone\\", you can skip this album completely. It's fun and catchy, but nothing really memorable. I was planning on buying \\"Payphone\\", so it made sense to get the whole album for $5 (I do think the whole rapping collaboration was totally unnecessary, but at least it is at the end of the song). It's not a bad album. I'm glad I got it.
B0077SGMXM|3.0|The game is ok. But i did not really enjoy it.  Coures weren't the greatest.  Would like to be able to play any couse instead of trying to unlock them.  Needs a save feature.
0345803485|1.0|Made a big mistake and bought the (Kindle) book before downloading a sample. I've read better prose on the back of a cereal box. Could not even finish. Is this all it takes to write a bestseller these days?
B007CKNX28|4.0|Each selection on Blunderbuss is steeped in a kind of 1970s mystique - This atmosphere is all encompassing from start to finish. Blunderbuss does the time warp and brushes against your ear with a nostalgic bliss. Some songs are downright lazy and won't be pushed or forced to a faster pace or conclusion.<br /><br />Jack White is entirely comfortable in this effort. Confidence reigns supreme in his vocals and you can tell he's creatively in control. It's a worthy effort, it's groovy, but I don't love it to death. I'm not on fire for the album but I am enjoying it.<br /><br />The album is growing on me slowly because there is no sense of urgency in any of these selections. Each musical moment pauses, examines itself and reflects. The album is slow paced. It's the kind of album that goes well with a hot cup of tea on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It's a kind of soundtrack you play when you wanna get lost in your own mind.<br /><br />Lackadaisically Recommended, to those who can relax and enjoy that which is not fast paced ;-)
B0086700CM|5.0|I was kind of mad when I discovered that Temple Run wasn't available  on my kindle. But now that is, I LOVE IT!
0470932139|4.0|My comment may not be accurate as this is my first photography book. The book is well presented - ofcuz.  Writing is very good over my expectation. Not the boring technical more than a diary of professional photographer or a story telling. Somehow i wonder the page turned because I am fall in photography or the story. Charming and easy to catch for a very amateur ..like me. U may find a smile on your face while reading it...<br /><br />Have fun!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I really like the physics involved in this game, it just kept getting better as I went through the game. New elements were introduced as you progressed and then they were combined into these frustrating puzzles.  Lime most people I found myself putting it down and walking away for a bit, but I kept coming back to it.<br /><br />The graphics and the sound on this game were really well done, the music never got too old for me.  The controls were well designed and I never had any problems with it locking up or messing up (besides due to my own mistakes).<br /><br />I would easily recommend this game to anyone and everyone of all ages.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really great app!! :) I love playing these games when I'm bored. Everyone should download this app for all the great games!!!!
B008CP93S0|5.0|If you don't have a sense of humor, don't bother watching this. If you are a David Wain and / or Paul Rudd fan, you will love this movie. It is hilarious with classic Wainisms and Rudd should win an Oscar for his performance. The writing will keep you laughing out loud and sure to inspire movie quotes with friends for years. The story isn't the greatest in the world and can be sappy at times but who cares, that is not what you are watching this movie for.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is fun but it should group games such as sushi with harder games instead of the beginner ones.
B005FITIGO|5.0|I got the DVD very quickly and I always love when it just fits in my mailbox so no fuss with getting it right away. I saw this movie in the theatre and thought it was awesome. If you are curious about how did our financial mess happen, this movie is one for you.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|After reading rave reviews about this book I just could not wait to get it downloaded on my Kindle, but rather than being a book I could not put down I found that I could barely pick it up!  The storyline was drivel, the writing style was simple and repetitive and overall it was an utter load of rubbish!  Anyone with a slightly over active imagination could have written this book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just got this game ablnd I love it! I haven't had any trouble at all with it regardless of what the other reviews say.
1451627289|5.0|\\"Under the Dome\\" was the first Stephen King book I had read, and it resulted in my acquiring respect for King as a superior writer.  \\"11-23-63: A Novel\\" is a work of science fiction, a genre which excited me as a teen-ager, but has held no attraction since, until, that is, \\"11-23-63: A Novel\\" which absorbed me into its make-believe world of time travel, a world enhanced by the book's historical references to the Kennedy assassination, which are completely accurate, the result of King's thorough and meticulous research.  There is nothing predictable about the plot, which is endlessly creative and, thanks to King's literary skill, believable.  The book was, perhaps, longer than necessary or longer than I would have liked, but it was so exciting and well done that, in the end, I did not begrudge the time it took me to read it.  This is a literary work of remarkable creativity, by a popular story teller who really knows now to write.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I just can't put Baldacci books down.  This was another one of those with a great ending to a seriously good story.  Like all my Baldacci books, I will read this one again.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|After seeing the reviews from the critics, I knew this movie would be good since most of the critics are complete idiots, especially the one in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.  I missed the movie in the showhouse but recently purchased it from Amazon.com.  I watched it last night and all I can say is it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  From beginning to end, the action was continuous and the special effects tremendous.  Although the movie made a small amount in the theaters, I would encourage anyone that has not seen it to buy the DVD and really enjoy a great movie.  Unlike Avatar, which made a bundle in the theaters, which I stopped after an hour since it was very boring, this movie ROCKS.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I paid for this app, but it still has a nag screen that pops up asking me to rate it. Well, here you go. One star. You have my money and if I had wanted to rate your app I would have done it myself, without you nagging me to do so.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Having quickly and thoroughly consumed Wool Omnibus, I'm a little ashamed to admit that I haven't really read any independent authors.  If this level of talent is out there in any quantity, I feel like it's our duty as readers to find it and feed it.  This is my first Amazon review, and I don't feel like I can really do this book justice with my feeble reviewing skills, so I'll keep it short.  Wool Omnibus is flat out fantastic start to finish.  Great characters, great story. It just keeps giving and giving and I can't wait for the next book.  Pretty much just buy the thing. Oh and support independent creativity.  if you want to see more art, music, and literature like this, support the people who pour themselves into the work.  It isn't easy, so let's all make sure it pays.  Buy this book.
037571457X|1.0|I had intended to use this in my class, because it was well recommended. However, after previewing this book I was hugely offended at the thought young teens would read this. There are several, very nasty, curse words and an illustration that depicts a man's privates as he urinates on a prisoner. I understand the need to make the torture known and to stay real to the moment, but that took it too far. I DO NOT recommend this book be used for young readers. I love books like \\"Night\\" by Elie Weisel, because even though it is graphic in its description of the horror of German prison camps, it does not become crude, merely factual. \\"Persepolis\\" could have left out those cruder elements and still been a book of interest when showing a changing view of Iranian politics.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app and all the complimenting add-on apps is literally changing my life at work. I am a district manager of a major company overseeing 21 locations and its helping me be a better manager and getting me close to my goal of going paperless.  I have it on my laptop, smart phone,  and kindle, and no matter where I am or what I'm doing I can do everything from make to do lists,  leave myself reminders, log conversations, document store visits with pictures,  etc etc all super organized and at tip of my fingers. I have separate personal lists like for shopping and clip and save ideas from websites.  And it all syncs perfectly. I cannot say enough!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great! Now I don't have to buy a calculator. Thanks Digitalchemy ! I hope you can make even better apps
B002MQYOFW|5.0|How do you review a book that has already been so well reviewed by so many others? I don't really have anything original to say, but I just had to chime in with a 5 star review.<br /><br />I bought this series last year and was immediately sucked in. It's one of the best series I've ever read, and I've re-read it several time since. It made me cry, and also made me laugh, and made me think.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is definitely the strongest book in the series, but the others are very good as well. I'm a romance junkie, so of course I LOVED Katniss/Peeta, but for once the romance was not the part sucking me it. It was just a very compelling story of survival from page one. I LOVED it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|at first it didnt work..... once i lowered the security settings from high to low several apps were on in the background...... so happy got it! it is a must have
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a very good watch for the money. It keeps great time for an automatic movement. The WWII aviator style is a winner.
1594202842|3.0|I enjoyed reading this. I always love hearing about people's methods of parenting, even my own's. This sure is one way to do it, and whether it's right or wrong, I can't say. Amy's methods are extreme and controversial. I sure as hell wouldn't raise my kids this way.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I've always been a fan of ghost stories and enjoyed scaring the heck out of myself when I was a kid, so it only seems natural that I would recommend this movie. This movie won't have you sitting on the edge of your chair, but it will make you jump back in your seat...At least I did anyway (a few times).  The acting is convincing, the story is entertaining, the scenes are spooky, and the characters are eerie.  I gave this movie four stars because it wasn't too clever, but the ending had an interesting twist.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesomly action packed,and fun.. I LOVE it! a bunch of my besties, told me about it,and the 1st time I played,I fell in love!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|very pleased so far seems to run fine on my kindle fire.  Looked at a few others and this seems to have very nice graphics
B007K3JCAE|1.0|Beware, the UltraViolet digital copy is a terrible idea.  I can't believe movie studios are trending in this direction when the iTunes was was simple and easy.  Now I have to download additional computer applications and iPhone/iPad apps just to be able to watch this.  Terrible.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is so fun to play and very addicting. I would recommend it for people of all ages.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|there needs to be a block so you cant make the same thing more than once but other than that its a great game :D<br />-nicole
B005LAIH3G|5.0|My expectations were low, and I wanted to watch the new Sherlock sequel, but my son talked me into buying this DVD. I have no idea why it didn't rock the box office, because I LOVE THIS MOVIE. My son and I are both motivated to read the 5 book series now. I call that a win!
B007PAAO0Y|3.0|Bobby Womack should stick to what he does best, soul music,these synthetic rythms are easily forgettable, tiring eventually boring, though it is good to experiment sometime.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OH. MY. GOD. It was so much better than the first! Which is usually unheard of! I was riveted the entire book. I was slammed at least twice with the plot twists. So did not see those coming! Now I'm starting to see what the hype is all about. I love how the author used the lessons Katniss and Peeta learned from the first Games and applied them to the second book. I found the writing to be better too. Way more depth to the writing, much more insight into the inner workings of the story. I am running out today to buy Mockingjay. Katniss is my new hero.
B0086700CM|4.0|it crashes my HTC EVO about every 5th game.  Usually when I get a power up and have gotten a ways.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|It's not as challenging as I thought it would be.  I get bored very quickly and have not felt like playing it for weeks.  I enjoyed Rio better.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|If you read \\"The Help\\" and liked it you will like this book too.  It is really good historical fiction.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Since using this app for just shy of a year, SwiftKey has made my mobile typing 37% more efficient. It has saved me 107,000 keystrokes and predicted 53,605 words. Over time the app really does learn and conform to your personal typing styles and learns your lingo and slang used. NO MORE AUTO CORRECT FAILS!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a really good book covering a current topic in today's world.  It kept me guessing the whole time.
034580404X|2.0|I read all three books - I keep thinking they would get better - what a disappointment.  This is the typical poor beautiful virgin meets wealthy non-committal guy - and of course he falls for her -  only add here is that they have sex about 50 times a day --- really - when do they eat or sleep ---- sorry but this plot was old -- only thing added was the repetitive sex.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|I've been a fan of Adam since AI, have his CDs, and was fortunate enough to see him live on his Glamnation tour. He still blows me away. This CD is Raw. The lyrics hold nothing back. Underneath, Better Than I Know Myself, and Outlaws of Love are prime examples. It goes to show following your own path is the right way to do it and he doesn't let anyone change his course.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|MIB 3 is very entertaining, and the addition of Josh Brolin as the younger version of K is inspired.  The plot is surprisingly tight and the action is constant and lots of fun to watch.  I haven't seen MIB 2, but this may be the best of the three.  I'm only sorry I couldn't see it in 3D.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great!
B00493E1GI|4.0|after a month I got a notice saying that my rental time was up when clearly I had paid for the movie!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Wow! This is the best album since Clockwork Angels!<br /><br />Seriously though, I like it and I think that's what counts. Makes me wonder if they'll ever make a \\"2113\\", or \\"A Farewell to Queens\\". Maybe something like \\"Counterpoints\\".<br /><br />If Twisted Sister came out with an album today I would suspect it would sound like...well...Twisted Sister from the 80's.<br /><br />This band moves forward and have persevered thoughout their career. This album proves that.<br /><br />It's good. I like it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|picture Mario in a leprachaun costume. the controls work really well and it is a great game. especially. for free.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app! it works great on the kindle fire! I would recommend this app for all ages... you can play with facebook friends or even a random person.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so much fun! There are so many different home you can create and so many different animals. It works great on the kindle fire.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|No problem playing on an Android Incredible II.  I thought I might have trouble seeing the scenes well enough to find the objects, but I was pleasantly surprised at the results.  I got this free from Amazon. I would not pay $4.99 for it...
0307277453|5.0|I think many of the other reviews have already expressed the same praise for this book that I would. It is written in a way that draws you in, and leaves feeling like you have a much firmer grasp of evolution. It is compelling, intriguing, and well written. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It has been fun to play. Wish there were more opportunities to get acorns or swap coins for acorns. My grandkids liked to collect the coins and try to catch Scat as he ran across the screen. Fun for all.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The first two books were nearly impossible to put down. The third one wasn't as addicting. Still, a very entertaining trilogy.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My children love this app, the funny faces of the animals make them laugh. They find the games great fun and love collecting the stickers to put in their book.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Well, i don't like this album because it's half good and half bad.<br />Living Things starts well, with 3-4 songs which are amazing, but if you go on, the album loses its first sound.<br />It's not good, i think 2,5/3 would a good mark for this album.
B005QBKXSC|5.0|Would buy again and again. Thought I bought the extended version but anything daughtry is amazing!!! Every cd from him just keeps getting better!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great writing!  Great story!  Even if you are not a runner you Must Buy this book!!!  Anoter reviewer mentioned that he or she had not read a book this good since SeaBiscuit and I completely agree.  I happen to be a runner and learned many valuable lessons and was entertained along the way.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a really fun game that anybody will love it has a wide variety of mini games, including darts and a game like space invaders plus its free
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It actually gets me up in the unlike other clock apps it forces you to do math problems before you can press the snooze button
0763644765|1.0|My granddaughter at 2 is talking in full sentences and this book was too simple for her.  The pages of em...ah...with pictures just made no sense whatsoever.  Not pleased at all.  Glad others were pleased as there is always a book for everyone.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Works really well but has a lot of issues with contractions. Doesn't recognize any contractions under 3 letters, and some at 3 letters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a reader and when I was told about this book I figured I'll give it a try.  Best thing I ever did because I loved the book.  I could not get enough of this book; all day and night.  I ended up buying all 3 books and when I was done reading I was saddened it was over.
B007URCTOG|4.0|This was a very touching story. It really confirmed my belief that we all have soulmates. This true story was so amazing.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|A lot of others detail why London calling is the best album ever. I can't go there. Station to station by Bowie is still my top album. Still i am glad i own. this outstanding album. The title track alone is worthy. + train in vain. 2nd the album cover is awesome
B0059XTUVI|5.0|This is a great movie about a VERY GREAT woman !!!  She opened the eyes of the world to the fact that there were more than a few men running all of our countries, including Great Britain, who were a bunch of fat-cats who didn't give a whit about the people paying their salaries...<br />Go get 'em girl !!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much. I water so long for it to come out. I think everyone needs this game.
B008BYXQJY|1.0|all the songs sound the same.<br />where's the creativity.<br />I miss maroon 5 of old when the lyrics were not insipid.<br />Why are all the songs at the same BPM, is Maroon 5 all about dance music now?<br />IMHO popular success gone very wrong.
0452273331|5.0|I can't tell you how often I recommend this great novel to my friends that are looking for a great, architecture book. It's one of my favorite novels I've read, and I'm really satisfied that I bought it. If you want an architectural, nonfiction book that you helplessly can't put down once you start reading than Go Purchase This Book!
B006QS1XRO|4.0|This is the story of Hassan Haji, young Muslim Indian from Mumbai who becomes one of the leading chefs of France.<br /><br />The story steeps the reader in the cooking aromas of India and France. In Mumbai we smell the clover and bay leaf and the bubbling massalas, in Paris the feral pungency of game birds. We follow Hassan to the exotic markets where he learns how to pick the tastiest chickens (from an Indian cook)  or the best cabbages (from his French mentor).<br /><br />The story of how Hassan becomes apprentice to a great hotelier and chef in a French Alpine village is very dramatic and moving.<br /><br />But there's more to the book than the romance of food. Hassan's romantic experiences with women add some welcome spice, although for the most part he's happy to spend his life \\"in the warm embrace of the kitchen.\\"<br /><br />The book is full of colorful characters, starting with Hassan's family and including idiosyncratic chefs and gourmands.<br /><br />And what a picture we get of the cutthroat world of French cuisine, where the loss of a Michelin star can spell financial ruin! And where desperately ambitious chefs elaborately \\"deconstruct\\" food  in rivalry with classic French cuisine.<br /><br />Foodies should enjoy the recipes in the back of the book. I personally don't care for either Indian or French food (Japanese and Italian are my favorites), but the book is so well written, even I could feel the fascinations of these cuisines.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to readers who like novels celebrating food and cross-cultural adventures.

0312576463|5.0|I found this book on my bookshelf - a friend from out of town had left it there for me and I had forgotten about it. I picked it up one day without reading about it...I just knew it was beastly - at 500+ pages - but I was ready to tackle it. My friend has good taste.<br /><br />I typically don't like when the narration switches throughout a story, but it worked with this book. And the characters...oh the characters....so unlikeable...YET...I wanted to read more...so unlikeable that they were almost likeable. I've never experienced that kind of feeling. The story follows the Berglund's broken family and broken family roots. In this day and age when everyone seems to come from a dysfunctional family, these characters seemed common place and relatable.<br /><br />Franzen's writing flows so easily I found that I felt these words really did come from the characters. I found their stories genuine, and although sometimes distasteful, I enjoyed them immensely and in the end, I had a tear in my eye - as everything ends as it should. Very complex - I'm not sure what the disappointed readers were expecting but I can definitely say that, to me, FREEDOM is a poignant picture of the struggles that families go through when trying to come to deal with their own personal lifelong and sometimes traumatizing struggles.

I read all three within a week and then reread them a couple of weeks later. I enjoyed the book and can't wait for more to follow, hopefully from Christian's point of view?? LOVED IT. The only reason I did not rate it with five stars was that the writing wasn't absolutely perfect, but it didn't matter. It still kept me intrigued.

B008578H9G|5.0|I was watching the next-to-last installment of House, M.D., and feeling a little sad that after Monday night the irascible diagnostician played by Hugh Laurie will no longer stalk the halls of Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. The show, like all shows that have enjoyed long runs, is milking the final-days stuff to a faretheewell. Chase left a couple of episodes ago. Wilson has been dying of cancer for several episodes, and now we find out that House is facing more jail time. And that's just what the show itself is perpetrating in the run-up to the grand finale (about which, I assure you, I know nothing). Fox, the host network, has a countdown-to-the-end campaign running that bludgeons you with such ferocity and lack of subtlety that any temptation you might have been entertaining in the direction of sentimentality is squashed like a bug.

B005I6EU48|2.0|The Verso Prologue Antique Cover is beautiful and it fit my Kindle Touch very well.  However, after a couple of months, I took it out only to find that it had permanently stained the back of my Kindle black.  This is extremely unfortunate since the primary reason I bought the case was to protect it from damage.  Granted the damage is aesthetic, but it is damage nonetheless.  I'm afraid I can't recommend this case until this issue is resolved.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />Customer service was prompt... After emailing Lightwedge about the issue, they responded that this is a known issue and that they would send me a replacement with a plastic insert to prevent color transfer as well as a discount on my next purchase.<br /><br />This is good, but what of the ones still on the shelves? At the least, there should be some sort of recall or notification that would warn of potential damage to the customer's reader and steps to mitigate it.

B000USU92G|4.0|For anybody who wants to know what their grandparents (or great-grandparents) did for fun in boring old public high school, watch this film. It was already a period piece when it came out in the late 1970's, and watching it again made me realize how much the life of young people in the United States has changed, and yes, still stayed the same. Based on the hit Broadway musical of the same name, Grease is the story of a group of teenaged friends during their senior year at a California high school; girls yearn after boys, boys look their coolest best to impress the girls, hot rods are super fast (kinda) and there's plenty of jitterbug dancing and rock 'n roll music to fuel it along. Sandy and Danny meet during the summer, part company then find out she's transferred to his school. Shall he admit his love or impress the guys with his machoness? Kinnikie and Rizzo have a hot date \\"parking\\". Is she pregnant? The whole school thinks so the next day. Frenchie drops out of school to be a beautician. Is it the right move? The rival gang challenges our heros to a race for \\"pinks\\". (If you've seen the Fast and Furious movies you know what that is, but I bet some of you didn't know that practice was so OLD.) Can this stuff possibly be entertaining? YES. It's not the situations but the carefree, fun cast that make this movie fun to watch, and turned it into a classic. John Travolta as Danny is young, sexy, and can he dance. He's a fine actor, and plays the role with just the right tounge-in-cheek seriousness. Olivia Newton-John is beautiful as Sandy, and what a set of pipes. The hit \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\" was written expecially for her to perform in this film, it was not part of the Broadway score. Also written just for her was the great finisher, \\"You're The One That I Want\\". I've seen the original Broadway musical and there was a lot more great rock 'n roll sounding songs and more dance numbers, but the humor and personality of the characters make this film move. Those of us who watched prime time TV in the 1950's will love the cameos by period TV stars in roles as teachers, principals, angels and DJ's.f us who watched prime time TV in the 1950's will love the cameos by period TV stars in roles as teachers, principals, angels and DJ's.

B007BZM30M|5.0|This song seems to be everywhere and it has the contagious explosiveness of a pandemic. I feel dirty giving it such high marks, but damn if it isn't catchy.
B007SGM084|3.0|I bought it because of the hype, and enjoyed the story.  It was different, suspenseful, and left me wanting to know what happens next.<br /><br />The writing, however, leaves much to be desired. The author's vocabulary seems limited, and her overuse of certain words and expressions is distracting. The sexually explicit portions become rather repetitive, and predictable. It seems like the author could have benefited from both a proofreader, and a thesaurus.<br /><br />I agree with those who say the Kindle version is overpriced. I wish I had bought the books, so I could re-sell them. I also found a few typos in the Kindle version, which - considering the cost - should be considered unacceptable.
0385751532|5.0|My 13-year-old brother was assigned this book for summer reading. I picked it up from our dining room table while he was at camp and finished it within two hours.<br /><br />As a well-read 25-year-old, I didn't expect to be so affected by a \\"teen\\" novel, but I was completely engrossed in Bruno's world. Much in the same way that kids' movies or TV shows sometimes have an extra layer of meaning aimed at adults, \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" can -- and should -- be consumed by readers of all ages.<br /><br />I highly recommend purchasing this Readers' Guide edition that includes an interview with John Boyne; his comments made the novel even more enriching for me.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Don't expect an appetite for destruction or contraband album. This one's more refined and not as raw. With that said, it doesn't necessarily mean the album is no good! This is a great rock n roll album in an era lacking quality hard rock albums. The lead singer Miles Kennedy is from Alter Bridge (check out blackbird album if new to alter bridge).  People either seem to love him or think his voice is annoying.  I personally love alter bridges blackbird album and Miles doesn't annoy me a bit.  Ok. So about the album...  This album is a whole lot more radio friendly than the aforementioned albums.  That doesn't mean its crap!  Yeah it has hooks. You will find yourself humming the chorus to half the tracks on this album.  Great guitar work from slash.  Great song writing by the duo as well.  There's a good mix of songs here as well which I like. Overall, the songs qualify more as rock than HARD rock or metal.  The overall tempo is a bit slower.  But just when you're ready for a hard hitting upbeat chorus or screaming solo, the album delivers it. Personally, I wish more albums offered this level of variety.  From the crunchy \\"Your a lie\\" Riffs to the melodic \\"Anastasia\\" lead guitar that will remind you appetites \\"sweet child of mine\\" signature intro. In summary, you can't go wrong with this album. It will appeal to a larger audience than say.. Velvet Revolver did.  Everyone will find at least a few tracks they like. Plus, my wife won't turn the volume down when I play this album in the car.  Contraband on the other hand...

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Although I was just as addicted to the trilogy as many others, I found parts extremely difficult to get through as she is a HORRID writer. NO ONE actually says \\"errrr\\" as much as she writes it and the main character's \\"innocence\\" was just not believable. Part way through the book I noticed the many parallels to the Twilight series so did some digging on the history of the books...I wasn't surprised by what I found.<br />If you want an easy, fun read...the series is for you.<br />If you want quality writing with characters you believe in, keep looking.

B000I8ES5C|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies and had no idea what to expect when I first saw this film. But it wouldn't have made any difference, because the first choreographed scene of the \\"ax gang\\" swinging their wares would have shattered any amount of preconception.<br /><br />The hero, Sing, is a disappointed young man who wanted to be...well...a hero. But when his younger self purchased a pamphlet promising the ultimate secret in martial arts it took almost no time at all to get his butt kicked half way to America. Now he's living in squalor, committing petty crimes, and longing to pass the initiation and join the powerful Ax Gang.<br /><br />But poor Sing's heart isn't in it and every time he tries to do something bad he gets his butt kicked again. Against this backdrop, an increasingly powerful, exotic, and inventive array of martial artists line up on either side of the escalating tension between the Axe gang and Sing's slum.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is full of twists and turns, witty satire on martial arts movie, and amazing special effects. But it's the human story of a young man's search for redemption that won my heart and gives the DVD pride of place on my shelf.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I had been researching wireless headsets for quite some time and decided to splurge a bit for the G930 and am truly amazed! I am a gamer and the surround sound does make an incredible difference. I never knew what I was missing with my standard $40 wired headsets. One important note: you need to download the latest software from the web site, which give you far more options on what you can do with the buttons beyond the interface that came on the disk.  I LOVE this thing!!!  Update Dec. 2016: Still have them, and they've been great. Been using them 4-5 times a week for 4+ years now and nothing has ever broken or gone bad. People reporting breaks must be abusing them. The only thing that has changed is the ear pads now show the superficial wear one would expect after all these years, but that doesn't impact feel or performance. When and if these fail, I'd happily buy them again. My son got a pair about a year after mine and he's had the same result as me.
B007ADIRDM|4.0|This playset is one of the nicer doll playsets mattel has put out in the last decade. The chair and couch are a nice weight, they 'sit' straightly without bending or wobbling when the doll is placed onto them. The cardboard backing to the coffee stand could prove problematic to children who play too roughly with their toys, so points off for that. The doll is lovely enough, though the one we recieved has loose knee joints and 'bobble head' syndrome. The dress feels (and looks) cheap as heck, but her jewelry is wonderful, as is her spiky ponytail clip.<br /><br />The small pieces would obviously be a choking hazard to pets and children who do not know any better than to put them in their mouths, but that problem is solved by being attentive and not giving the set to a child who is not mature enough for it.<br /><br />I think our biggest complaints would be that there is only a couple small food items, the couch does not match the color of the chair, and the dress is so cheaply made. Even still, my wife and I would recommend this set for others.
B007MKJ76O|5.0|Best written TV show ever.  So many layers of Beckett to peel back.  Every episode is worth viewing over and over so as to learn more about each character.  The interplay between characters becomes much clearer when you view all the eposides from the beginning.  For me it became a challenge to determine where the relationship stood in each episode.  I look forward to the new season to see how the writers handle Beckett's leaving the force and the reaction of Alexis and Martha to what developed over one night.  Enjoy.

B0076NAWWA|1.0|I agree with all of the other 1-star ratings. I am a long time, serious fan of Steve Morse and was very excited to hear about this new recording...then I listened to it: What a disappointment!!! The music is very contrived and so prog-rock-formulaic to the point of causing nausea...and the vocals absolutely destroy the hints of innovative musicality that occasionally burst through for a few seconds, like the sun trying to shine through very thick cloud cover. Don't get me wrong, I love good vocals and meaningful lyrics, such as Steve's prior release: Angelfire, Sarah Spencer has a wonderfully unique voice that compliments the music nicely.<br /><br />The editorial notes here on Amazon.com describe how the album was conceived and recorded during a nine day timeframe...well guess what? It shows!<br /><br />Sorry Steve, this album is definitely not up to your (Industry) Standard. I will patiently wait for another recording from you that is 100% instrumental and not so contrived...another High Tension Wires would be a dream come true. In the meantime, perhaps you can get inspired by listening to any (and all) recordings by the Peatbog Faeries, such as: [[ASIN:B006179ZVQ Faerie Stories]], [[ASIN:B005DLZF5G Dust]], or [[ASIN:B003B7R4WQ Mellowosity]] - Seriously, check 'em out!!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|There's a lot of play for this being a free app when I got it. Storyline is interesting and all the puzzles will keep your interest. There are only two minor drawbacks that I have found so far. I wish some of the mini-games were better explained because it has taken a bit of trial and error to figure out a few of them. Also sometimes in 'find the difference' games some of the objects will flash off and on.  Other than that I am thoroughly enjoying this app on my Kindle Fire!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This trilogy could have been better.  It would have been better if they combined all three books into one.  The story line was weak. Now the main two characters worked well for the book.  But that was only thing that worked for the books.  It became very irritating after awhile.  The best part of these books was the beginning of the first book. After that it went down hill.  It needed more action outside the bedroom.
B007NZDES0|5.0|The DVD was awesome - just like the concert.  It came with a CD of the same for such a low price - very much worth it.
0062197258|4.0|Well, last week I gave you a title I thought you should add to your must read suspense list this summer. I'm sorry, but you'll have to add Into the Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes to the list as well - it's a remarkable debut novel and a  fantastic edge of your seat read!<br /><br />The book's prologue opened with a court transcript that piqued my interest. Mr. Brightman is being questioned about his relationship with a Miss Bailey.<br /><br />Into the Darkest Corner is told from two time periods 2003 and 2007. It took me few pages to work out that the two time frames are told from the viewpoint of the same person - Catherine Bailey in 2003 and Cathy Bailey in 2007.<br /><br />In 2003, Catherine is a young, full of life woman who meets Lee, a bar doorman, one night. He seems like the perfect catch - attentive, good in bed, handsome, thoughtful and more. But, in 2007, Cathy is tormented by extreme anxiety, panic attacks and OCD. She can't stop checking her doors, windows and locks. What in the world happened between then and now? Maybe Lee wasn't quite the catch he seemed to be.....?<br /><br />Haynes employs a highly effective technique, unravelling the two stories in alternate chapters. The danger in 2003 is insidious, slowly building towards a climax, with the tension ratcheting up and up.  I liken it to a scary movie at the theatre. I wanted to yell at Catherine 'NO, trust your instincts - get out of there!' In 2007 Cathy is struggling to cope with life when.........<br /><br />Into the Darkest Corner does deal with quite serious subjects. Haynes does an insightful job in depicting obsessive compulsive disorder and domestic violence.<br /><br />I never read other reader's reviews until after I'm finished my own. I was honestly surprised to find there were many readers who did not like the book. I myself found it to be a riveting psychological thriller that kept my interest until I turned the last page. (Actually I had a hard time not skipping to the end midway through just to see what happened)  Into the Darkest Corner was Amazon UK's Best Book of the Year for 2011 and film rights have been sold.<br /><br />Recommended by this reader.through just to see what happened)  Into the Darkest Corner was Amazon UK's Best Book of the Year for 2011 and film rights have been sold.<br /><br />Recommended by this reader.

B004LL1HM4|5.0|Gave this CD a listen based upon my interest in somewhat similar other bands/musicians and was immediately hooked. the combination of dreamy harmonies, intelligent lyrics, acoustic melodies, creative composition and a rather bizarre, intangible phenomenon (described below) set this band apart from most for me. In general, it's extremely difficult *not* to succumb to a feeling of strange but unbridled euphoria when listening to the Foxes; they possess a sound which is at once hypnotic, intoxicating and liberating and \\"Helplessness Blues\\" perfectly encapsulates these qualities.<br /><br />Regarding the aforementioned \\"phenomenon\\": When I first listed to this CD, I thought of Christmas, for some reason. Perhaps it was due to the specific keys in which the songs were written or the earnestly cheerful disposition of the songs themselves. Or hell, maybe it was due to the \\"jingle-esque\\" tambourine which is pervasive throughout. In any case, that was my initial impression.<br /><br />Upon subsequent listens and at different times of the year (late winter, spring, summer, end of summer, fall), I discovered that the CD served as an almost perfectly suitable soundtrack at any given time or relative position of the sun.<br /><br />Yeah, I know. It's probably inconsequential to most. But something about a CD which can just as easily be considered perfect for a snowstorm as it can for an afternoon spent beneath a tree in the meadow in the middle of summer just sort of....speaks to me.

B0029O08WA|5.0|Sometime in everyone's life is that moment when a hole opens inside them and the hurt and pain are overwhelming. The song Possibility by Lykke Li with its dirge like sound sums up that feeling.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have to give this a five-star rating, based on my use of previous products.  Most especially the Tritton AX720 and the Tritton AX Pros.<br /><br />Here's a little synopsis of my issues with Tritton headphones:<br />Both my Trittons have excessive wires all over the place. Never mind that I can't dial in decent audio with either set. The AX PROs actually sound better than the AX720s, which are brittle and weak-sounding with very muddy bass levels.<br />I hate that you can't get hi-def audio from any SS headphones yet. I can't watch my blurays with headphones on unless I want crappy stereo. By crappy I mean that it's not just IN STEREO, but it sounds hollow and distant, with little to no resonance. Also neither Tritton set accepts BOTH analog and spdif inputs; you need to plug in one or the other (and adjust audio options in control settings), so I would be switching out the input/outputs based on what I needed for best audio choice at any given time, and I am not fond of using just the USB audio drivers.  It's ironic that the \\"lower-end\\" Trittons perform better with binaural than the actual 6-speaker headset<br /><br />- After trying several other headphones, I was never satisfied with the surroundsound capabilities; those that delivered in that department really failed in fidelity and audio clarity.<br /><br />This was my last-ditch effort in finding decent headphones, and they were on sale for a decent deal so I snatched them up.<br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I like being able to switch between 7.1 audio or Dolby stereo on the fly with a mere flick of the switch on the side of the earpiece.  For gaming, the 7.1 is reliable and well positioned.  For TV shows and most music, I switch the option off.  All without having to get up and move inputs around, go to control panel, etc...<br />I was wary about using USB-based audio decoding, but so far it's worked well for me and I have had no hiccups.  Playing TF2, CS: S, Batman: Arkham City, Insomnia and a handful of other titles worked great.<br /><br />Even better is they are wireless, so that's just one less cable to clutter up my sitting area!  Yes!  Some say these are a little heavy, but I haven't noticed much discomfort while wearing them for three hours.  I also enjoy being able to walk around my place while listening to a program without tripping over wires or having to take the phones off.<br />The mic is more sturdy and reliable than other headphones I've had.  Setup was easy.<br />Audio quality is good-to-great.  For other HPs in this category, it's probably the best.  I highly recommend tweaking settings in the ADVANCED equalizer in order to get a more pleasing sound.  What these phones do it does well, but not top-tier compared to other stereo headphones, even within the price range.  But you don't have to compromise much.  Bass is balanced, mids are clear and highs are not too screechy.  Once again, advanced equalizer settings in the control panel makes a big difference.<br /><br />Overall, I can't really praise these enough.  For those searching for 5.1/7.1 audio headsets, this is a good option.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Wireless<br />7.1 audio works well, especially compared to other sets I've tried<br />Can switch to stereo and back quickly<br />Decent sound quality within the three major ranges<br />Easy to set up and get going right off the bat<br /><br />Cons:<br />The USB wireless hub could use better wire management<br />Heavy (compared to other headphones, but I wasn't bothered by it)<br />Have to recharge batteries after 10 hours, making on-the-go use with portable equipment a possible hassle<br />No case<br />No extra earmuffs or other goodies<br /><br />These get my seal of approval.

Likeable Social Media was the first book of five I purchased in the business and social media field.<br /><br />Mr. Kerpen is a talented writer and complements his discussions about what it means to be a \\"likeable\\" brand with positive and negative anecdotes. It's a fairly quick read with frequent content headers, screenshots from Facebook and easily-digestible highlights to share with coworkers (such as the \\"10 Reasons Why Consumers Like Fan Pages on Facebook).<br /><br />There are other books and resources out there that give more concrete how-to's and a step-by-step guide to undertaking social media. If you are looking for content focused around these areas, seek out whitepapers and ebooks from social media monitoring companies who will gladly hand you the information for free in return for your contact info.<br /><br />Hands down, the best asset of this book is its appeal to different audiences. While you could place this book in the hands of a CEO to show them the power of social media, I as a 21-year-old digital native confident in my knowledge of social media was able to walk away with roughly 10 pages of notes and suggestions.<br /><br />Likeable Social Media left me not only encouraged but empowered to undertake the creation of a social media strategy for a company.<br /><br />Where this book falls short is a lack of diversity. Discussions surrounding Facebook dominate this book--and rightfully so given its place as the top social network. I would have liked to see more discussions on the power of Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Google+ in the same scope Facebook is discussed. I do understand though that this book was published in 2011 and things have drastically changed even since then.<br /><br />However, I still rate this as a five-star book. What's incredible to me is how connected and committed Mr. Kerpen is to this book and building an engaging community. He practices what he preaches. Recently, I tweeted a friend with a suggestion to read this book. Within five minutes, I had a personal tweet sent to me from Mr. Kerpen thanking me for recommending his book.<br /><br />Mr. Kerpen clearly gives those working in social media a blueprint on how to be more \\"likeable\\" and lives it out in his own social, online life.shed in 2011 and things have drastically changed even since then.<br /><br />However, I still rate this as a five-star book.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Readers need to read the third book to see what happens in the end.  I was pleased to see how it ended.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|This album is amazing!! Some of the songs sound like Stone Sour but that does not bother me they are still excellent.  I love Slipknot because they can take simple riffs and make them very catchy and amazing. They added guitar solos for songs on this album which will make many people happy.  I'm now going to rate the tracks in order from best to worst(excluding the intro). (they're all good though)<br /><br />1. All Hope Is Gone 10/10 - Amazing song the lyrics are decent but the guitar playing is better than any other band of the genre (Alternative Metal) that i could think of except for SOAD and In Flames (New In Flames).<br />2. Psychosocial 10/10 - I love the guitar solo in this song and they combine melodic singing and aggressive screaming which is Slipknot at their best to me<br />3. Gematria (The Killing Name) 9.5/10<br />4. Wherein The Lies Continue 9.5/10<br />5. Dead Memories 9.5/10<br />6. Snuff 9/10<br />7. Gehenna 9/10<br />8. Sulfur 9/10<br />9. This Cold Black 9/10<br />10. Vendetta 8.5/10<br />11. Child Of Burning Time 8.5/10<br />12. Butcher's Hook 8.5/10<br />13. Til' We Die 8.5/10
0689835604|4.0|My 18 mos old granddaughter loves this book. She lifts the flaps and then points to those body parts on her own self.
B007SGM084|3.0|As sex therapist I could see the appeal of these books when it came to living a fantasy for the afternoon. Although it was interesting to see a glimpse  into the world SMBD it could have had a little more story, a little less sex. It got a little too predictable when it came to the sex.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not only do I like erotica, but I specifically like the BDSM theme. But this is drivel. Juvenile, banal, trite, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, insipid and a complete piece of garbage. I would like to give it 0 stars- there is absolutely nothing whatsoever redeeming or worthwhile about this book. How can a character who refers to her genitalia as &#34;down there&#34; and says things like &#34;oh my&#34; possible turn anyone on? In addition, Ana isn't even interested in BDSM but she is won over by Christian's looks and money. GAG!!!
0985114606|1.0|I noticed its quick rise on the New York Times Best Sellers List, so I decided to buy it after reading the book was for readers who loved the 50 Shades triology.<br />Let's start with the positive; Sylvia Day understands sentence structure and readable writing.<br />Now for the rest. Day did not create characters in whom the reader could invest. Her plagiarism of E.L.James' characters failed to develop focus character arcs that made sense, i.e. unused drawer of toys, no spanking, nightmares without reason, etc.<br />While there is lots of sex, there is no lovemaking.  Yes, the f-word can be sexy. But, if the word is used too often and paired with C- words of trashy novels, it's trashy.<br />My suggestion - skip it!
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I hated that I missed this movie at the show. I have enjoyed all of the Underworld Series so far and this one was no exception. It was action pack and introduced apart of humanity that I never seen coming.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This is another good Liam Neeson movie.  Interesting different personalities and how they react to serious life threatening conditions.  The ending is a little different than I was expecting.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Wonderful read, have heard so much regarding this book and it has definitely lived up to all the hype, enjoying it enormously.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|It is an ok movie.  My husband thought it was really good but I wasn't that impressed.  It does have a couple of plot twists that I wasn't expecting.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|As others have pointed out, this is not Neil Young the folky songwriter (although there are undertones of Neil's concerns about social justice and hardscrabble American-Canadian rural life).  It's Neil Young AND Crazy Horse, the grungy garage band rockers, and this one's right in their wheelhouse, overamped distorted guitars, overenthusiastic vocals, and general rabble-rousing.<br /><br />It's not perfect, it's not delicate, it's not all thoughtful and poetic (though NY brings all his skills and sensibilities to each project in some measure): it's downright rude, crude, sh*t-kicking, boot-scootin' rock and roll.  It gets right up in your face, then commences to roll through your house, flatten the back fence, and rip doughnuts in the back forty like a 'dozer on the loose.<br /><br />This might not be the Neil you personally love, or the Neil you were expecting or hoping for, but it's a side of Neil that's been there since the beginning, in early Buffalo Springfield rave-ups and in the whole series of Crazy Horse albums.  If you don't like it, cool.  But there's no need to diss it: just get out of the road so you don't get run over, and let the rest of us enjoy the heck out of it!<br /><br />Thanks in advance, y'all!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I liked the game but it was a bit confusing the prices were upside down and on the right side. it was hard to see the puzzle pieces
B007J4T2G8|4.0|BDSM is so not my style....but this book was fantastic. Was not what I expected in the beginning and certainly not at the end. Had to read the 2nd book right away.  The loves scenes are hot, even those that are erotic, surprisingly.  I'm a fan of EL James.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It's a lot of fun to play. Only negative is that it continually asks you to log into FB. Other than that, have a blast finding the hidden objects.
B0085776BG|3.0|The action sequences for the movie were great. Sometimes the acting was good and other times it was just flat. I would watch it again but Im not sure about adding it to my collection
6305781427|5.0|This is the most wonderful music ever performed, Yanni is a genius. Love it. DVD is back from 1993, but it was a magical enchanting night. Yanni plays with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Karen Briggs as the lead violin player was amazing. This is what launched Yanni's career into the mega star he is still nowadays.<br /><br />Enjoy
B003Y5H5BA|1.0|i was waiting for this blu ray for a long time and couldnt wait to get home and relax and watch 21 jump street. i was a fan of the tv show and was hoping that this movie would stand up right along side it, boy i was wrong, it wasnt funny,it seemd to drag on, the story and plot was weak and boring. even the gag reel they have in the extras section wasnt even funny. the only thing that i thought was cool about the movie was they had a few of the org. cast playing they old roles. other then that, this movie was a big upset in my eyes.
B00005B1W5|5.0|What more i can say, about Yanni. He is simply the master of instrumental music. All the cultures mixed in a magical blend of sounds. Taj Mahal, India and the Forbidden City at China. Another great concert for your collection.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Fun take on the classic search and find games. Interesting story line, I have actually read most of the dialog instead of skipping over it. Interesting little mini games too, some could be explained a little better but they aren't too hard to figure out. Don't know I would have paid $4.99 for it (I got it free yeaterday) but I def recommend and I really enjoy it!!!
B002QH2NUA|3.0|It should have said Like New because the CD did not come in shrink wrap plus some unnecessary sticker was on it as well, really annoying
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Great books, great Kindle edition and a great price!<br /><br />The only thing I can complain of is that chapters are numbered on the index, but each chapter on the book does not include the chapter number (only the character's name).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have NO idea why this is such a big deal!  This is written horribly.  I have no idea why women adore Christian, he's a possessive, jealous man.  The sex is the book was boring...there are SO MANY more good books with great kinky sex AND a good storyline.
0553288105|5.0|I read it 6 years ago and ordered it again after reading it mentioned in one the lists of \\"best novel life-forms\\" and I love old Professor A.<br /><br />When Isaac Asimov presents a new world or new science, it's so thorough that you can swim in it, and if you don't understand a concept, you can go back and study it.<br /><br />So, twenty pages in, I realized I'd read it before and enjoyed it even more.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I waited to review this app until I used it for awhile and am glad I did. it seemed to work ok for what I wanted. At first. Now it loads. And it loads. And loads. And never quite gets there. People that use LinkedIn are usually professionals that want and expect their apps to perform. It's a shame that now it will be a while before the audience LinkedIn is looking for trusts it in this format. And too bad for us that could utilize it. Here's hoping the app will do what it promises soon!
B0058VW36U|4.0|okay yes cut the rope is an awesome game but there could be some changes like updated faster.don't you agree
B006VA57CY|5.0|The second series is even better than the first! I can't wait for series 3 of Downton Abbey to begin.
0811875040|4.0|This pretty book will inspire you to bake. I love the pictures! I love the detailed instructions for baking beautiful cakes, and I like the idea of baking 6 inch cakes for smaller portions. I don't know if I will ever actually bake one of the cakes, however, as they are quite complicated. That said, there is more to this little book than complicated little cakes. I recently made the lemon shortbread cookies, and they were a big hit (and they were easy). This book also includes a lot of easier, yummy looking, less pretty cakes that I plan on trying very soon. I recommend this book to anyone that likes to bake.
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|If you love this album then you must hate Hyprid Theory and were born no earlier than 1990. I remember when that album came out and it was so new and ground breaking. This is crap! Their last 3 albums all sound the same. This is nothing new from what they've already put out, and if you love their boring sound then you'll love this album. Otherwise, you'll be like me and completely give up on them.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|I have seen this movie 7 times in a single month. Believe me when I tell you that this movie is just that good. Before I bought this Blu Ray DVD, I would watch this on Netflix. It was so nostalgic. I decided I had to own this DVD, so I bought it for Blu Ray to see what miracle today's technology could do for this old school movie. I was so amazed when it started with the opening scene with the camera going over the water headed to the boardwalk. The quality was clean and beautiful. Through-out the movie, the color felt so much richer and creamier. If you own a Blu Ray DVD player or a PS3, buy this copy. It's great to see the amazing Lost Boys in HD Resolution!
0756655307|5.0|Simply awesome and amazing :) contains everything from Stan's old days including other marvel Creators up to 2009 :) unfortunately it doesn't go pass 2009 but everything is on point and exact. Much better compared to the Marvel encyclopedia 2003 Edition. Good Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0053YEM7U|4.0|Basically the guys from the Buggles had some left over tracks from back in the early '80's.  So they got a few members and added to those and Presto, a new-old album.  If you liked the Buggles, you'll like this album.  If you are more into Anderson, maybe not so much.
B0071MV540|3.0|This was an ok movie, slow in some parts but over all ok.  Eddie Murphy was overall the best part of the movie!  Should have had a bigger role!
B0058YPG1G|4.0|I loved the first three seasons of \\"Breaking Bad\\". I know of no other show where you see the main character's motivations evolve in real time. The attention to the nuts and bolts of running an illicit business and the ramifications thereof may be boring for some, but for me it's what sets this show apart from all other crime dramas. The actors and writers deserve every award they've earned for this show.<br /><br />That being said, this season was not my favorite because it seemed to trend towards sensationalism (first with Gus' revenge plot on the cartel, then the poisoning of the boy, then with the final, unbelievable special effects shot of Gus at the hospital, which looked like it was inspired by the movie \\"The Quick And The Dead\\"), which tells me that the writers may be running out of steam.<br /><br />Overall, season 4 was still quite entertaining (Aaron Paul's best) and worth seeing again, and aside from a few loose ends, season 5 will pretty much start with a clean slate, so it will be interesting to see where they take the show.<br /><br />Like I said before though, as much as I love \\"Breaking Bad,\\" I hope they have the strength to pull the plug before the series takes a major tailspin.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. No bugs or glitches. On a trip, it's the best thing to have. I would suggest this game to anyone that is both over the age of 12 and enjoys to think. If not, you might get annoyed with it. I got annoyed at a young age.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Avatar is a great film in my opinion and this product is great value. Using seamless branching you get all three versions of the film without having the irritation of disk flipping.
B005LAIH5O|5.0|First off i would like to say that i am a big fan of clash of the titans, and wrath of the titans is 10 times better than clash. That being said, this is one of the better movies i have seen this year. obviously not as good as the avengers by a long shot but the acting was good and the action was great. I like how in this movie you get to see the gods use there powers and fight. Also there is actually a titan \\"Kronos\\" and the cgi for him is outstanding. Give this movie a shot, you will not be disappointed!
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|I actually really enjoyed the first film apart from the final act that seemed rushed and wasted. This sequel while very high quality (esp on bd) visually contains a convoluted plot, rubbish characters and a didssapointing tale. There is nothing I actually liked in this sequel which was a great shame.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good ending for this series I was a little depressed with the war at the end, but overall a good book.
0345803485|5.0|I love the books its interesting and exciting and I wouldn't change a thing about it ...... Its awsome I'm 22 and I enjoy the books story line so much people shoulnt just based on its adult content
B006IDG2T6|2.0|I really didn't like this book much.  It seemed to ramble on and end in mid-air. I may re-read it, but not likely.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|love the challenge. you don't have to be a golf fan to enjoy this game. I love how every course is different and items become unlockable. should consider more unlockable items on the next game. overall its great!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had read her first 2 books and absolutely loved both of them!!!  But this was nowhere near the great writing that the other 2 had! While it did have some twists and turns that took me off guard, I found it dragging on and on, and there were many times I just wanted it to get to where the author was trying to get you.... just sooner!  I love a really good psychological suspense thriller, and her first 2 books fit the bill perfectly, but this one just falls flat.  And the ending???  Boring!!!  It was almost like she didn''t know how to end the story, so she just stopped. (  I'm ok, you're ok, everyones ok.....ok, lets just end this book!  )  I hope her next attempt at writing a book goes back to the style of her other ones....If it gets compared to this one,  I wont be reading it!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is an scellente, interesting book.So good that they are already casting to make the movie. Its fun, makes your sexlive a little more spicy .....read it!! it´s a must!
8866131369|5.0|Known moleskine for a long time, this is my first moleskine book, already start use it. really great book and very cheap.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|The product arrived ahead of the scheduled time and came packed with all the goodies I was hoping for. Very happy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is poorly written; it is the trashiest piece of garbage I have ever read; however, I did not finish the book.  What a waste of paper!! I don't even want it to remain on my kindle!!<br />I would not have purchased this book had I read the reviews first.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app in my Kindle Fire,  cell phone,  and my laptop and everything syncs seamlessly! Best app ever!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|idk what the people are saying about force close because it hasn't happened to me at all and this game works great on the kindle fire... ;) very fun game but there was an element that surprised me.. humanxhuman=? lol
1401307450|5.0|Doesn't matter if the book is half fiction or not, it is still well written for a rockstar biography. For those who love RHCP it is a must, but if you are just into this type of music and lifestyle, you may still find the book enjoyable.<br /><br />Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, some RHCP songs may never sound/mean the same to you after you read the book.
0545128285|5.0|I got this book the next day after I ordered it and it is in perfect condition! The book is a good size and is s good short read and is intriguing to any Harry Potter fan. I recommend this book to die heart Harry potter fans.  Love it!
014241543X|4.0|This one was definitely a sad one. And a serious one. Throughout the whole book, it really made me think about life and what really matters.<br /><br />We know the story: a tragic accident, lives hanging in the balance, emotions flying all over the place. The story is told through the eyes of Mia, who is basically having an out-of-body experience while her body is desperately fighting for her life. There are a ton of flashbacks as Mia recounts how she and her best friend came to be, memories of her parents and her little brother, and of course, the wonderful love that is Adam Wilde.<br /><br />Even though this was a sad story, Gayle kept it light at times and brought good memories of Mia's life which I loved. There were a lot of real issues addressed in here and in the end it really makes you appreciate the life you have and the people in it. It made me think about how uncertain life can be, how things can change in the blink of an eye, and although I wouldn't recommend reading books like this all the time because that can seriously mess with your head, I love reading stuff like this every now and then to take some perspective in life.<br /><br />Gayle's writing is superb and very heartfelt. She can make you feel happy one minute, sad the next. She knows exactly how to get to your heart and in your head and does so flawlessly in this story. Probably the only complaint I have is that there wasn't enough of Adam. You get a nice backstory of his and Mia's relationship, how they fall in love and all, but there wasn't enough of him in the story overall to really do it for me. I suppose it kind of works out and builds to the big climax at the end of the story, but I still think he could've been in there a bit more, it didn't seem like he was that big of a figure.<br /><br />And the ending?! Talk about a cliffhanger! Sure, the story is about Mia's choice, but the ending wasn't what I expected and after reading the synopsis for Where She Went, I'm a bit disappointed in how things ended up. Their love seemed to be such a big and overpowering entity in If I Stay, I was a bit disappointed on that part. I'm hoping Where She Went focuses more on their relationship and how epic their love is supposed to be.things ended up. Their love seemed to be such a big and overpowering entity in If I Stay, I was a bit disappointed on that part.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|Let's you choose resolution to download. Download as MP3. I have never had any real issues with this app. It's great.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|Very happy with the price of product and I guess the product itself.  All disc are there and work.  No scratches.  This was to be a NEW item but, that was not the case.  The seller re-shrink wrapped the box and saved all the original shipping materials for re-packaging.  Seller is a lair.  Item is not new.  One of the pouches holding disc 2 of season 1 is torn.  The Pilot script is missing.  Other than the seller being a lair the product was great.  I over paid for a used item, but oh well.  Sold for $249 is store a year ago.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This show is becoming one of my all time favorites with the likes of The Sopranos,Deadwood,Mad Men,and Breaking Bad it's one of tv's best.  Season 2 build on the first season and improved in every aspect I won't give away any spoilers but to me Season 2 was one of the greatest tv seasons of all time and the build up the finale was nothing short of amazing.  I definitely recommend this to any fans of great drama shows,it's a wonderful period piece with spectacular production great performances Steve Buscemi really shines and has become Nucky Thompson he has transformed into the character.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|So far I have been quite impressed with this game. Not only in its rich scenarios where you must find random objects, but a pretty compelling storyline as well. Something to keep you entertained for hours. Don't like the constant bugging to write a review tho, only knock for a star.
B002M4CIHK|5.0|The Video might not be pumped up like the Paramount no-frills release, but this European version of 3 Days of the Condor is clearly the winner.  AND, most importantly, IT IS IN ENGLISH !  Amazon's listing here says \\"French Only,\\" but that is incorrect.  The start-up menu gives several language options, including Australia, which IS an ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY !  That is the most important information you need if you're here in the States, and looking to purchase this edition of the film.  The Video is in a word: accurate.  It looks like a very precise rendering of the original 1970's presentation.  Hasn't been tinkered with much, just a great upgrade from DVD without compromising the integrity of the image.  The sound is also accurate for this film.  And the digital track included does the job effectively without being \\"sweetened.\\"  The Extras are really teriffic: a couple of documentaries (both of which are in English; this was apparently a UK release,) and the commentary by the now deceased director Sydney Pollack is very informative; even if he only comments sporadically.  All in all, if you're a big fan of this film, this is the edition you want, if you can find and afford it.<br /><br />Hope this review has been helpful to 3 Days of the Condor fans considering this purchase.  Be safe, be well, watch a movie now and then.
B004SBBDB2|4.0|The iPhone component video and composite video cables have now been eclipsed by the digital cables (since digital can do mirroring on the 4S and iPad 2,3), but if you are in a situation where you only have a component video input, you've got to do what you've got to do.<br /><br />You must know that you can only view certain content through this cable: YouTube videos, video saved on the phone, photos in your Camera Roll or Photo Library IF you put it in Slideshow mode (I'm unclear as to whether any apps are able to output video. I couldn't get the PBS app to send video via this cable, but have sent PBS video to Apple TV to view). For a decent summary of your video output options, search for this in your favorite search engine, \\"How-to: Use an external display with an iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch\\".<br /><br />As for the quality of the cables, it seems to be fine. I'm not happy about how difficult it is to identify the red video cable and the red audio cable. In this set, there is a sticker on the rubber binding about 8 inches from the ends that shows which are audio and which are video. I like it much better when the ends are differentiates with a label or mark.<br /><br />There is a USB cable along with the audio and video ends, which is nice if you have an AC adapter to plug in near the TV to charge while you watch a movie or long slideshow.<br /><br />Overall, this is fine if you understand the limitations and a good alternative to expensive brands.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book reminded me exactly of 50 Shades of Grey minus the raunchy sex scenes.  An innocent virgin falls in love with a possessive bad boy and they get married.  I really don't understand the whole part on her being Lucky 13 and how that ties in but whatever.  It is so unrealistic- I can't believe I bought this book.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|controls a little annoying but overall not bad.  the game seems a little too easy and pretty much a Mario spoof but still an enjoyable waste of time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read an erotic book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was hooked to the story line once I was past the graphic sceens. The book is an easy read, but there were alot of repetative words or phrases which made the book drawn out more than what it should be. I am not a well versed reader or writer for that matter, but I did notice. I do recommend the book because it was impossible to put down, and I immediately purchased the remaining books.l<br /><br />I purchased on my kindle but as I walked by the desks of my co-workers, I noticed the copies on their desks as well. It was and continues to be the topic of conversations. We are even discussing what actor will best portray Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />After I read the book I learned the Publisher does not allow sharing of the book through kindle; which upset me.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|You can't miss this. It's just amazing. The quality of the blu-ray resolution and sound makes de experience extraordinary. You feel like you were in a Broadway Theatre.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle.  It is a really good way to work puzzles if you are a puzzle addict like me because you don't have to worry about having space to work it on.  Love it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not a single glitches.  perfect controls<br />I love this game and could not be more happy with it<br />awesome fudgin game
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Graphics are good, the story line so so. Sometimes the dialog was amusing and sometimes seemed to go on and on.<br />I found the mini games annoying so I skipped over most of them.<br /><br />There are some glitches though. Such as it asks you to find all the digital objects. One was an antique rotary phone?<br />Find the wine bottle which was actually a wine glass.<br />Find the paper wrapped objects. Some were wrapped in paper and some were books, not wrapped.<br />Find the goblets, some were spice jars with lids, there was a sports trophy (not the cup kind), a pitcher.<br />Some of the items you couldn't even see. Even after the hint button showed exactly where it was, I still couldn't see it.<br />These are just a few of the things I found and it got a bit frustrating. There are plenty of hints though so that helped.<br /><br />It claims there are over 50 rooms, but actually there are only 10 which are used over and over again. Many of the objects were also used over and over again.<br /><br />Other than these things, I still kind of enjoyed it but not worth $4.99 IMO. And at almost 83MB it won't be sticking around on my Fire.

B0085PFG1U|5.0|I was looking for a graphing calculator for my Droid and this one has all the features I needed for playing around with the equations in Cardano and Omar al-Khayyam.  One of the dangers of these devices:  if you input x^3-8x^2+49=0 (Cardano chapter 30 problem 5), you'll get the full cubic solution for all 3 roots (7 is very easy to miss amongst all the radicals and quotients), but you won't see the quick factoring (x-7)(x^2-x+7) which yields Cardano's much simpler solution.  Documentation is a bit thin but available in more detail elsewhere.<br />It's a nice app and besides, anything that gives a value for i^i...
030758836X|3.0|I finally found the book and set aside time to read it.  So far so good.  It was enthralling and I couldn't stop.  I thought I figured it out.....so far so good.  UNTIL the last few chapters.  Not good.  What a let down.  This girl is gone......
145583050X|1.0|Somehow, probably by the grace of God, I was able to finish this took.  Because it's so long, your mind and will power tells you to keep reading, because, surely it will all come together and make sense, right?  No.  I kept waiting for that \\"ah-ha\\" moment, but the only moment I steadfastly approached was my brain turning into mush and spilling out of my ears.  The characters were completely unrelatable, especially the \\"little people.\\"  Are they good, bad, moody, keepers of the balance of the world, or just of the beat?  If you haven't started the book, don't.  If you have, god speed, my friend.

0679731725|2.0|I remain baffled by the acclaim heaped on this book. I was never convinced by Stevens, who feels like a literary construct, a cliche \\"perfect servant\\". He's so self-effacing that he barely exists as a man.  I kept thinking of Mr. Hudson on \\"Upstairs, Downstairs.\\"  Now there is a butler who is also a real human being with his own opinions and feelings. I'm sad to learn that high school kids are being assigned to read this pretentious bore.

Initially I was worried it would be focused more to the individual who was looking to lose weight or new to the paleo lifestyle.  I quickly found that not only did it speak to me as someone with nutrition certifications and a good amount of experience but it also found very good ways to explain the \\"science-y\\" sections to people who may be new to paleo. Very good read and I've recommended it to my peers in the fitness industry, friends, family, and clients alike.

I love the way it looks and I love the music! the quests take forever, though and I actually had a moment where I felt clausterphobic while digging deep into the ground. lol my only real complaint is that the on screen controls are kind of awkward on kindle fire since its kind of big and heavy,  and you can only play on landscape mode. I feel like my hands were stretching unnaturally and they started to hurt after a while. that's not the game's fault though. overall,  great game!!!

B007MU85D0|4.0|I got the mp3 album on the super-duper spectacularly cheap-o here at Amazon after listening to the 30 second clips and thinking my wife might at least liked it. Of course I decided to give the full thing a listen before passing it on, and on that first listen it struck me as not great but at least very good. Then the second listen came... then the third. Well, now after several full listens, I'm glad I got the album. I don't hear anything worthy of a (near) perfect album like a 5 star rating would suggest. I also don't hear anything new in this. That is unless we're talking about the particular blend of Los Campesinos and Tokyo Police Club that pops up a couple of times. But, on that note, I understand completely why the word \\"refreshing\\" seems to come up in other reviews and I agree with that description. With what's come out lately from many artists there are several trends carrying the the bulk of the alt/indie music choices, e.g. those recent inclinations towards electro-pop or a deep folksy sound. This, on the other hand harkens back to a few years ago of more fun, lightly rocking, swelling, catchy tunes. That isn't by any means a great description of this album (which I think is much more soulful than that), but there's a lot about it that reminds me of that sound. And, in the current musical landscape, it's refreshing to get back to that sound without sounding outright derivative of any one particular group. So, it gets a lot of credit for giving some catchy tunes (\\"Mountain Sounds,\\" \\"Little Talks\\") and having a generally enjoyable sound. I'd even say it wouldn't surprise me if OM&M do come up with a 5 star album after this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an awesome book. Hooray for Howey who puts together a compelling plot, interesting characters and an amazing show of emotional depth in the Wool Omnibus.<br /><br />I came across this book after learning that Amazon rated their epublished books. Knowing who was at the bottom of that list (me, on the day I epublished my book) I figured why not check out who was at the top? I found Wool in the #1 epublished science fiction books spot, and it deserves every positive rating that got it there.<br /><br />Rather than talk about specifics of the book, and spoil it for those of you who should be reading it, I'll just touch on a few of book's aspects that stuck in my mind.<br /><br />First, Howey has a great way of describing a scene and a situation with poignant lines. One doesn't read large chunks of description when reading Wool. No, instead the reader seems to absorb Howey's descriptions without realizing it. One of the first lines of the book stuck out for me. The reader is still trying to figure out what is happening and where they are. Howey offers this description:<br /><br />\\"Dawn's dim light coated lifeless hills that had hardly changed since Holston was a boy.\\"<br /><br />I like the use of dim in this sentence. I like the use of coated, and I like that the reader begins to understand that something is very wrong with this world, and it has been like this for some time.<br /><br />I also very much liked Howey's twists. The end of Wool 1 made me want to go out and shout that people needed to read this book and NOW. I was so pleased with Howey's misdirection that I couldn't wait to read the next 4 Wools. While the end of Wool 1 is one of my favorite twists, there is quite a good twist near the end of Wool 5 which left me smiling at Howey's cleverness.<br /><br />Overall I can't recommend the Wool books enough. I did find book 3 a little long, but I finished the entire Omnibus in 3 days, so it couldn't have been that long, right?<br /><br />Read these books. They are awesome.
B0088TG252|5.0|If you ever questioned whether the Public Employees should have their Unions dissolved and their salary packages lowered and their benefits packages appear at least like their private sector counterparts, watching this movie will certainly make you agree that a total overhaul of at least the CIA's pay and benefits and Union Membership(if they have one), should immediately be undertaken. According to this movie a sleazier bunch of Government Employees never existed with the possible exception of the British Equivalent (MI-5/6).<br />Great action movie outside of the knock on the \\"Company\\". Good to see Denzel back in good form doing something besides runaway train movies. The movie starts fast and never lets up in the action department and it is certainly good to hear that Ryan Reynolds has finally lost his rather \\"gayish\\" accent he began his career with.<br />Superb movie, I just wish I would have caught it on the big screen. I rented it and am now thinking of buying a used copy as this is a movie worth watching more than once.<br />Easily Denzels best movie in about 5 years and I hope it is a portent of more good movies from the man in the future.<br />Lots of shootouts, snipings, man on man fights to the death, car chase scenese, car wrecks, explosions.....everything one wants in a movie (except there were no boob shots but the nature of the movie hardly lends itself to such matters)!!<br />Just too damned bad the \\"good guy\\" went public rather than sell the info the entire movie is based on.
B005M2A4D4|1.0|I suggest that you do not buy this product from Amazon. They are not being careful as to whether or not they are selling a legal, professionally produced item.  I received this Dr. Who the sixth season, and it is very obviously a cheap copy.  The disks are scratched, the holders are clear (not dark blue as they should be) and are falling apart.  The cardstock is cheap and not glossy, the printing is not sharp as it should be. It is nothing but a knock off.  I have already complained to Amazon, and am arranging to return this for a refund.  I usually do business with Amazon to avoid this kind of problem---I am dismayed to find them selling phoney disks.  And if Amazon is not selling them direct, they are not be careful about what kind of product they are selling for another compnay.  My advice is to get your Dr. Who, the Sixth season somewhere else.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This story is disturbing in the best, can't-put-it-down kind of way. Gillian Flynn's imagination takes the reader into dark and complicated territory with twist after twist to keep things interesting.

0099579936|1.0|Starting this book off I was trying hard to get into it, i made it about 100 pages in realizing that this book wasn't my cup of tea. I figured that I'd read it anyways.. bad choice. I made it to roughly the middle of the book when I had to put my nook down, update my fb status to say how horrible it was and call it a day. The main character is not only boring but is a highly inexperienced 21 year old virgin. If E.L. James didn't say that she was 21 then I would have thought that she was 16.<br /><br />The amount of repetition was terrible... If I had to read that Ana was \\"biting her lip\\" one more time then I would have ripped it off of her and gave it to the \\"hungry children\\" that Christian is so worried about when she \\"doesn't finish her food.\\" GET OVER YOURSELF.<br /><br />I also didn't like Christian, It was almost scary reading how aggressive and demanding he is.. some might that thats attractive but definitely not me. He is way too full of himself. First of all, he's sounds like the perfect man... that a 16 year old girl would imagine. He's rich, got his own company, plays sports, fit, flies planes, has a beautiful mansion, etc... way too overplayed.<br /><br />I am in shock that someone would give this book anything more than one rating. Shame.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I saw 21 Jump Street in the theater, I loved it, and so pre-ordering the Blu-ray was a no-brainer.  The movie took its place among my other favorite comedies: Meet the Parents, Superbad, The Hangover, and Bridesmaids.  I loved Jonah Hill in Superbad, so I was not surprised that he did a great job in this.  The real surprise was Channing Tatum whom I had always viewed as a bit of a vacant, dead-eyed hunk.  He still has that vacant look, but it totally works in this movie, and he proves he has a real talent for comedy.<br /><br />The Blu-ray features include:<br /><br />1) Commentary with the directors, Hill (Schmidt), and Tatum (Jenko)<br />2) Deleted Scenes<br />3) Gag reel<br />4) Cube-o-Rama - Ice Cube's outtakes<br />5) Back to School - outtakes from Schmidt's and Jenko's high school years; interviews with the actors, directors, and producers on high school life<br />6) Brothers in Arms - interviews and outtakes on Schmidt's and Jenko's bond as cops<br />7) XXX (I've censored the name) on set - In case you are unaware of the cameo, I won't spoil it<br />8) The Rob Riggle Show - feature on the gym coach, also known as the cop who Tasered The Hangover guys<br />9) Peter Pan on the Freeway - feature on the filming of the crazy car chase with, yes, Hill in a Peter Pan costume

0307592731|5.0|Thank you, Oprah, for bringing back the book club, and beginning round 2 with this fabulous memoir, \\"Wild\\" written by the even more fabulous writer and human being, Cheryl Strayed.<br /><br />Ms. Strayed was 22 when her beloved mother died and everything went to hell. In the next 4 years, her family, marriage, sense of self and self worth all disintegrated in a horrifying spiral. But \\"Wild\\" is far from self pitying or tragic, though I would have completely forgiven her for going that route given her multiple tribulations.<br /><br />Instead, she makes the decision to hike 1100 miles of the magnificent Pacific Crest Trail that stretches from Mexico to Canada along the west coast of America, and to do it on her own, with no serious hiking or backcountry camping experience.<br /><br />\\"Wild\\" is the story of how those 100 days on the PCT trail turns everything around for Ms. Strayed. She writes with a vibrant personal tone, and tells a compelling, complex, beautifully structured and paced story of families, relationships, ambition, love, loss, landscape, and redemption. And it's a rip through read. I highly recommend you get yourself a copy.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I read a bunch of reviews of different bottle cutters before deciding to buy this one. I wanted to recycle my stockpile of wine and soda bottles into juice glasses and wedding centerpiece vases.<br /><br />This bottle cutter works really well, though I don't think the hammer is great. I haven't had any luck with it. Instead I heat up a kettle, score the bottle once, dunk it in a bowl of cold water, then slowly pour the hot water over the score mark. Some thicker bottles take a couple rounds of hot/cold to break. Try to pour the hot water evenly over the score (keep turning the bottle) so the stress isn't focused on one section of glass - this can cause cracks. It definitely takes practice. I asked all my friends and neighbors to save their wine bottles for me. If you do get cracks you can hide them by painting or frosting the bottle.

B0081L37Z0|4.0|This isn't a cerebral movie and it's not supposed to be; it's the kind of movie you pop in when you just want to chill, laugh and not think about the world's problems.  It's not meant to be analyzed or taken seriously, just to entertain and it did.  We thought it was goofy and got some good laughs out of it.  It went a little too far over the top a couple times, but you expect that with this kind of movie.  I'm glad they included the cameos of the original cast, especially Penhall.<br />Minor observation...Ellie Kemper is quickly becoming the new Jennifer Aniston in my book...she plays the exact same type character in every role I see her in and it is the type of character that was cute at first, but now I've seen it so many times that it's nails on the chalkboard.

B00004YA66|2.0|An odd twist on time distortion in which, due to the inexplicable appearance of the aurora borealis over Queens, a New York cop is able to communicate via ham radio with his long-dead father thirty years in the past. Completely ignoring the warnings of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, he immediately spoils the upcoming World Series and dozens of important life moments for his father, before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders. The film can't decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path, and its main plot mechanism is clunky, under-explained and inconsistent. It's also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end, with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father-son baseball allegories. Hackneyed, hammy and haphazard, it plays like a bloated sci-fi short story in desperate need of revision.

I make sure to have mine handy in the car for a road trip or driving to work.It always puts me in a good mood and the people working on the re-mix(and let me say i am not a big fan of re-mixes) have done this in a way I believe it will be pleasing to other Michael Fans as well.<br /><br />If you do appreciate Michaels gift to us with his music and the amazing talents of everyone involved with Cirque du Soleil, the CD is a must have, and if you had not had a chance to attend the show, starting in May 2013 a permanent show will be at the Mandalay Hotel in Las Vegas.<br /><br />God bless, RIP Michael , you will never be forgotten !

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the best novel I've read all year.<br /><br />When I started reading I knew next to nothing about it other than it's been the top seller on Amazon, not counting those \\"50 Shades\\" book. I'm glad I went into this book blind, and I recommend others do the same. Without giving anything away, the basic set up is this: It is July 5, 2012, near Hannibal, Missouri, and Nick comes home on his fifth anniversary to find his wife Amy missing. The girl is gone. He calls the police, and of course they suspect him.(It's always the husband, isn't it, these days?) The story alternates from Nick's point of view to entries from Amy's diary, and gradually we see that this was far from a perfect marriage.<br /><br />I was drawn into this book from page one. The tension steadily ramps up in the first half of the book. Then, just when you feel you've got a handle on things, Flynn drops the floor out from under you, and all hell breaks loose. It's a thrill ride of a plot, with twists that seldom turn in the direction you are expecting. Finally, we are brought to an ending I didn't see coming, nor did I even like. Honestly, I wanted to throw my Kindle across the room. Then I reread the last few chapters, and realized how just how brilliant, and incredibly appropriate the ending was, making me love this book even more. And I have to say the villain Flynn has here created is one of the most remarkable, disturbing, and flat out bark at the moon crazy I've found in a very long time.<br /><br />There is some salty language, and adult themes, so be warned if that's a deal breaker for you, however, I found none of it overly excessive or gratuitous. After all the book is about intimacy, or rather the illusion of intimacy, asking the question can you ever really know someone's true heart?<br /><br />I gulped this book down like a glutton, and after a 400 page meal, was hungry for more. It's a good thing Gillian Flynn has two earlier books I can read.<br /><br />And, by the way... if anyone knows a couple about to celebrate a fifth anniversary, I think Gone Girl would make an excellent gift.nows a couple about to celebrate a fifth anniversary, I think Gone Girl would make an excellent gift.

006207993X|5.0|The Martian Chronicles<br /><br />Ray Bradbury's recent passing created an opportunity to reread some of his stories and novels.  No, I don't like all that Bradbury wrote, but his whimsical, lyrical style always attracted me.  He could create a world of \\"Firemen\\" in Fahrenheit 451 or the mysterious characters of \\"The Illustrated Man\\" and leave me entranced.<br /><br />The Martian Chronicles was no exception!<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />The book itself is a loosely-knit series of short stories, one leading to the next, in date order in the writer's 21st century future.  Here we have Earth that is looking towards Mars as a haven from the brewing atomic wars and rumors of such.  What impressed me was the stylized characters and fleshed-out civilizations and how both Martian and Earthman deal with each other, as well as their own jealousies and prejudices.<br /><br />Stories!<br /><br />I won't bore the reader with a mini-review of each tale, but the few that I really liked involved some of the crazy characters - one an off-kilter man, Spender, part of a crew from the Fourth Expedition, who didn't want to see Mars commercialized as he looked upon the dead Martian civilization (destroyed by Man's diseases - holy War of the Worlds!) and decides to kill off his own men and keep the planet pristine!  That plan does not go over well with Captain Wilder.  The darkness of the story and its clear criticism of colonialism were enticing to me.<br /><br />The other story I really liked involved the last colonists on Mars (the rest being called back to Earth because of atomic war) who missed the last rocket, and gets lonely.  Far off, he hears a phone ring.  He finally finds who rang it, hoping for some female company, but the guy isn't so lonely that he does not have standards!<br /><br />Finally, the tale of a Martian and an Earth worker, both going to a party driving in their respective vehicles and meet each other on a lonely road - 10,000 years apart!  Crazy.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Most of the stories flow well one to the other.  Ray does reflect some of the 1940s' style prejudices of the time which may put off modern readers, but if you read Ray's poetic style in its historic context, you too will see that a lot of his criticism and satire is still quite relevant.<br /><br />Highly recommended!><br />Bottom Line:  Most of the stories flow well one to the other.

B005LAIGRS|5.0|Safe House is an intense spy-themed action thriller about a young CIA agent, Matt Weston, (Ryan Reynolds) stuck at a dead-end job as a \\"housekeeper\\" of a CIA safe house. After an attack on his facility, he must protect a potentially deadly, and rather devious, traitor, Tobin Frost, Denzel Washington) who's being pursued by terrorists hoping to recover a secret document. Frost comes to Capetown, South Africa to receive a highly-sensitive piece of information from an MI6 contact, he finds himself surrounded by enemy assassins, with little other choice but to surrender himself to the American Consulate, lest he be shot down in the street. Matt and Frost go on the lam, trying to stay ahead of their pursuers, while also entering into a deadly cat-and-mouse game of their own.
0446613444|2.0|Harry Bosch is a disgusting character. He chain smokes. He doesn't shave regularly. He guzzles beer, spilling it down his chin. He is `wiry' and wears cheap, crumpled clothing. He sweats profusely. He talks back; he is insolent, egotistical, and rude. And yet, somehow, beautiful women fall for him. He treats them like trash, and yet he sleeps with 2 gorgeous women in the span of only a few days. Yuck! I cannot imagine getting close enough to him to even think about kissing him, let alone being carnal with him! Blech! Because Harry is so disgusting, I cannot bring myself to feel empathy for him or to cheer him on.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is an implausible character. He is an LAPD detective who somehow is allowed to break all kinds of rules and continue working on the force. He is a vigilante and insubordinate. He fails to follow direct orders and yet he still has a job? Also, where did he get so much money that he can throw around willy nilly going to bull fights and such?<br /><br />Harry Bosch has double standards. SPOILER ALERT:  In the previous book, Harry stood up for the law rather than justice, coercing another character to turn herself in after breaking the law. However, in this book, Harry breaks the law and covers it up.<br /><br />Finally, why in the world do all the characters speak without using any contractions? The language does not breed believability.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Simply put this head set is awesome.<br /><br />This device was comfortable to wear, easy to install and the sound is amazing. Installed from the disk, then located the software from the Logitech site and installed from there, works great. Easily meets the 40' range, and still very clear. i highly recommend this item for anyone who wears a headset for any length of time for any reason - additionally the mic is very clear and adjusts easily.<br /><br />Awesome product, worth every penny.
0062082353|5.0|I would probably give this 4 stars but i rounded it up because the 1 star critics are too harsh. Its an easy read, very gripping, sure the guy has an ego and is immature but then how old are these guys that are fighting and you gotta have a strong ego to go through hell and come back.<br /><br />If you want a fast paced blow by blow of being in action after action then this is book is right on the money.

B005NQ94KS|4.0|The movie set me back a step or two after seeing it. It permeated my thoughts for several days after watching it. Still does. It is brilliant acting, editing, and writing. This from a slough sometimes too not-able to buy into it all. Watch it. Take it in. See what you think. Not wasted time.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was a great ending to the series. The only thing aspect of it was the disappointment in the ending. I felt like their should have been more for Lisbeth. But it kept pace and in played true with her character, and you cannot be mad about that.
1594202842|4.0|Given all the controversy this book received upon publication, I expected a fierce defense of the \\"Chinese\\" method of parenting. Instead, the book turned out to be a revealing memoir of a parent's struggle raising two very different daughters - and it was a joy to read. I think a lot of the venom directed toward the book comes from parents who secretly wonder whether Chua is right, and whether a super-strict, authoritarian parenting style is the best for their kids. It took me more than a year to pick up the book because I harbored this latent fear as well, but the book didn't move me from my parenting instincts. If anything, the lesson from Chua's narrative is that no two kids are the same, and the art of parenting is learning the specific methods that develop and motivate each of your children. Despite the initial marketing, Chua willingly relates her struggle to adapt her parenting style for her second daughter, and ends up backing away from her tigerness. This makes for a tension-filled, gripping narrative.<br /><br />I found Chua's writing to be a delight - full of irony and humor, precise and concise, making the book a quick and entertaining read. It was a clear five-star book for me until the ending, which I found too abrupt, with too many loose ends. The book's climax causes a profound change in Chua's philosophy, but she only gives us 20 pages of post-epiphany text versus the 210 pages she spends building up her pro-\\"Chinese parenting\\" argument and persona. I was uncertain what Chua wanted to take away from the book and wished she'd given us a better idea of her current thinking. Nevertheless, I applaud her for summoning the courage to open her family's story to the world and put into writing her innermost parenting struggles. She clearly knew how much opprobrium her initial parenting approach would create, since her daughter Lulu articulates all of this in the book already. I recommend that all readers give this book a chance - it is provocative in the best sense of the word.

B003YUSBRW|5.0|My initial order was a pair of shoes too large for my feet. I sent the seller an email and they responded promptly with instructions. The same day they sent me a new pair of shoes, and I also sent back the large pair. I appreciate the seller sending out the new pair of shoes even before they had received my retuned pair. Great seller, thanks!<br /><br />The shoes are also fantastic, they feel like walking on soft cushions. They are cool (temperature wise) to wear, light, and stylish. I would defiantly buy them from this seller again.

B006RED4GA|2.0|WOW how to rate this HORROR flick? I can honestly say I watched this twice just to be sure I'm not that stupid but I still can't answer that question because after 2 times I still don't have a clue what the heck happened in this movie. Is it good or bad I don't know it it entertaining, sure I guess so, does it keep you on your toes, that's an understatement. I just wish I knew what was going on, what's the plot, how does it end? Did it end? I know it stopped and I'm glad of that but you can be I won't watch it a 3rd time...
B001FB5634|4.0|Very little dialogue, though it does not detract from how good it is. This is much passed over but I feel the gritty story and bleak visuals are the core of this movie's draw. Get it.

B0076NAWWA|2.0|I am a long time fan of Steve Morse. I consider him one of the best guitarists in the world, and love about 98% of his work. This release is a disappointment. It sounds like they never really figure out what they want to do with themselves. It still has some good musical passages which keeps it from being just one star. The vocal parts throw a damper on the music. To me their colors never get off the runway! If you're looking for Steve's usual mix, don't bother. If you want something different and can put up with the crappy vocal parts, some of the music is worthy of a listen if you have some extra bucks to blow.<br />MacBayne
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Great game. I dont like the fact that you have yo connect to.Facebook Everytime you do something. But its.fun yay
0345803485|1.0|I don't like writing bad reviews, and I've read a lot of them thus far on the book, personally I have to agree. I got the book before reading them, and I really wish I had, because I would have saved myself the money and the wasted time I spent on it. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it never did. It read a lot like Twilight with sex, the characters are too perfect looking, repetition, and the story is just ridiculous. What I haven't seen a lot of people touch upon was how flipping creepy Gray is. (SPOILER:)He flipping stalks Anna, to a bar by tracking her phone, to her work, and to even to another state while she's visiting her mother, and she's ok with this. It send a BAD message to women. Believe me I already had an entire rant about this on Facebook, and to some of my friends. Also, this was the first erotica book I've ever read, and the sex scenes were not hot. SPOILER: I only liked one, and it was very early on, and it wasn't even a sex scene. It was where he was kissing her in the elevator and held her hands in a way she couldn't do anything about it. I'm hoping all erotica isn't this bad.<br /><br />I've heard the next two books are much better than the first, but I just don't know if I can get through them. Sadly I do have to purchase the next two though, not for myself, but for a friend who asked for them for her birthday.

B005I735F2|5.0|Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) were a British rock group from Birmingham, U.K., who released eleven studio albums, in the span of their music career, between 1971 & 2001. Their music is extremely creative and innovative - when I was a child, I always associated their music as something associated with the sci-fi genre & with the preconceived, supposed existence of aliens....this was due to the fact that the cover design of their album, \\"Out of the Blue\\" is an expressive, fantastic bolt out of the blue - released in an era where 'synthpop' was neither known nor too much appreciated by the world audience. Thus, Electric Light Orchestra is certainly the world's readiest candidate for the 'Most Grossly Misinterpreted And Most Unjustly Despised' band of the past thirty years - which is a great pity because they were highly talented & have representated their very own genre of rock music.<br /><br />Synthpop is  music that exhibits a predominance of the synthesizer, also electronic & bass guitars, accompanied by drums & an orchestra for the background music. Any CD of ELO has a sound quality that is always a bit muffled & blurry around the edges - this is part of how they want their music to sound & to the best of my knowledge, probaly done purposely to cast a unique blend of their own rock culture. The tone of the albums is almost always sharp - the treble is a bit hyped & the bass is toned down, to avoid a thumping drum beat - that is ELO for you!<br /><br />This album is positively the best you could posibly possess of all the ELO albums - it is the definitive/ultimate collection that is very indicative of all ELO albums -it is absolutely superb and good value for money for anyone who enjoys any variety of rock music. You would do well to go for it - in a rush!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|My daughter and I both enjoy this game.  It is not as challenging as I would like but it will do. I would buy the app and will look at buying more by the dev.

B000005E60|2.0|The Sinfonia is one of Boulez's worst recorded performances. He simply has no gut-level feel for this delightful music, for its flambouyant theatricality. Plus the recording is poorly balanced, with crucial vocal and instrumental parts almost inaudible in places--especially in the centerpiece, the extraordinary Mahler/Beckett-trope movement.<br />The only truly recommendable commercial recording of the Sinfonia remains the 1968 performance by the original Swingle Singers and NYPO, all conducted by the composer. Since it's only the 4-movement version of the piece, it will likely never be released in digital transfer, and that's a crime.<br />The Eotvos is okay, but nothing special. Sound's a bit clearer than on the Boulez, but otherwise just a B/B- rendition. The Boulez gets a D/D+, and really just for the effort of making the first digital recording. But you gotta wonder why they bothered...<br />If you want to hear a great performance of this great piece, get the 1968 analog LP recording!

030758836X|4.0|I loved this book. LOVED it. Until the end, that is.<br /><br />The story line is extremely well-crafted. Flynn did an equally good job developing plot and fleshing out characters. The  narration of the book switches between the main characters' perspectives throughout, which makes for a very rich story.<br /><br />I would have given it five stars because overall, it's great! Until the last two pages, where the story ends in the worst possible scenario.
0547569653|4.0|As an ultrarunner, I especially enjoyed this book. Runners and non-runners alike will find Scott's story (and race stories within the story) enthralling as well.<br /><br />Scott's writing style is open and honest and genuine -- right away, you feel like you know him. I was captivated by his life story, his training, his races and his advice on running.<br /><br />There are also a lot of great suggestions on how to become a better runner, and not the same old advice. He offers up mental tricks as well as techniques he has borrowed from his experience with yoga and other sports. He's done quite a bit of reading about great runners and there's a lot he's gleaned from that too.<br /><br />Though I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, I don't find his references to how he came to be vegan trite or sanctimonious. As someone who enjoys good food and cooking, I found it interesting.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter he includes a tasty-sounding recipe, and I'm looking forward to trying a fair number of them.<br /><br />I met Scott at a Fun Run and book signing event. After the run, he spoke. He talked about what he eats, how he trains and how he became a runner as a result of cross-training for Nordic skiing in high school.<br /><br />One thing he said that particularly resonated with me: To run an ultra you've got to be \\"hungry.\\"<br /><br />It's so true. You may possess the training, fitness and ability to run 100 miles but you may not even make it 50K if you aren't focused on your goal. There are always excuses to DNF, and unless finishing truly matters to you, you're likely to succumb to those excuses.<br /><br />My favorite quote from this book:<br /><br />\\"It was the moment in an ultramarathon that I have learned to live for, to love. It was that time when everything seems hopeless, when to go on seems futile, and when a small act of kindness, another step, a sip of water, can make you realize that nothing is futile, that going on -- especially when going on seems so foolish -- is the most meaningful thing in the world.\\"ish -- is the most meaningful thing in the world.\\"
B00846TTDG|1.0|I don't want to seem unkind for the deaths and traumas these guys are enduring, however,I couldn't give this inane corporate informercial any lower a rating than 1 star, I apologize, because it sucks big time if you understand where it's coming from.<br /><br />This is a corporate enlistment document attempting to show younger minds how much fun it is to be able to kill with impunity and to make the rest of their lives miserable, all for the continued growth of corporate wealth and power. These guys are our sons and daughters going out and killing for their corporate masters. And we the people got sucked into this nightmare because we the people trusted the people we elected to do what they promised they would do, so we could work and do what we needed to do to live our collective lives out at our homes. We had to trust them, because we couldn't do it ourselves. Then guys like the bankers and oil barons came along and took advantage of what president Wilson did to US back in 1933... and we have what we have...<br /><br />They think they kill and die for God, Country and Flag... but they kill and die  for Corporate growth and a New World Order... just ask daddy Bush about that!

030758836X|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is as fun and entertaining as any book I have ever read. It is the perfect summer detour from more serious reading, while at the same time being a brilliant satirical study on the cerebral dance that is marriage.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn takes us on a raucous missing person ride with a fascinating and appealing unreliable narrator, while she examines the marriage of the couple at the center of the drama. The pathology of Nick and Amy Dunne's marriage is bonechilling...but I believe if every reader who is married, pays very close attention, they will probably, rather reluctantly, see at least a little bit of their own relationship within this psychological brew of a tale. Marriage is a very intricate and mysterious dance between two people...no two being alike. We all find our ways at working each other, Nick and Amy simply take it to a whole new level.<br /><br />This is my first Gillian Flynn book, but trust me, even though her's is not my genre of choice, I plan on reading her previous books this summer. She is a nuanced and brilliant weaver of stunning suspence, while including a fair amount of pop culture. Lovers of one of my all time favorite HBO shows, \\"6 Feet Under\\", will recognize an especially compelling \\"borrowed\\" piece and HLN's Nancy Grace receives quite a nod as well.<br /><br />I have to agree with a previous poster who recommended that you skip reading too many reviews of this one before you dive in...you do not want even a hint of a spoiler for this one. Also, disregard everyone who criticizes the ending...it is delicious... This book is a summer treat...INGULGE AND ENJOY...
B005I6EU48|4.0|This is a great cover. It's pretty straight forward, so I'll keep the review the same way. Before I bought this, I read a number of reviews stating that the Kindle Fire didn't fit, or that the cover didn't close over the Fire completely.<br />Concerning the fit, it is very snug, but I don't think that's a negative attribute. I don't want to worry about my tablet falling out, and the elastic bands keep it in tight. Also, I was wary about the elastic losing it's elasticity over time, but these bands are sewn securely into the inner cover, and aren't made of cheap elastic.<br />As far as the cover not laying flat on the face of the Fire, that's solely due to it being new. I remedied that in about two minutes. Here's the trick. Before you put your Fire in, hold the case with two hands (left hand on the top cover, right on the back), so it is open and facing you like an open book. Then, gingerly roll/rotate the spine back and forth, by pushing/pulling the front and back covers alternately. In about a minute or two, it will be broken in, and the top cover will lie neatly on the face of your Fire.
B001NKI60W|3.0|I'd watched the trailers several times for \\"Mamma Mia\\" and frankly, they covered the high points of a thin story I felt after watching the full movie.  The movie belongs to Meryl Streep and she puts her usual professionalism and fun into the part.<br />The other actors give their all and you can tell that they're having fun with their roles.  The setting and camera work is like a travelogue for the Greek isles.<br />It's fun and convenient to have movie rentals through Amazon and save money from either buying or going to a brick and mortar theater.  I'm glad that it only cost me $3.99 for this movie.

0425263908|1.0|This book is a perfect example of a desperate author trying to make an easy buck of Somone else's idea. The only reason I finished the book was so I could give an honest review. It's terrible. Absolutely dreadful. Unlike fifty shades of grey where the sex is involved with solid character development, this book has a sex scene on just about every page, the sex is trashy, and when the characters arent having nauseating sex all they do is talk about it. The characters aren't believable, and the plot Line is very hard to figure. I'm pretty sure this author just took fifty shades of grey changed the character names and then changed the sex scenes to be a bit more trashy like her writing. I think EL James should sue. Isn't t funny how when one author writes a masterpiece all these little money grabbers pop up and try to copy it. I know imitation is the greatest form of flattery but come on get your own god damn ideas. Btw I won't be reading anymore of the crossfire novels.

1595825045|5.0|There seems to never be enough of this stuff, no matter how much I read, watch, or learn, I want more everyday. Avatar is close to my heart (being my favorite cartoon show hands down!). I can't state enough how Bryan Konietzko & Michael DiMartino are legendary geniuses of our time! I love the background stories, captions and drawings they put into this book. You really appreciate the show even more. As most reviews stated, I wish they gave us more - you know, one large book for each season/element. But nevertheless, this book is a must have! I cherish it. And, on a side note, if you haven't already heard or seen of Bryan and Michael's new show, The Legend of Korra, stop whatever you are doing and go and watch it! A branch off the original, and still an incredible show!! These guys don't disappoint! It's a little different comparative to the original Avatar with Aang and the gang, and it might take an episode or two to get used to, but mark my words, I promise you two or three episodes in you'll be hooked! Bottom line..support these guys and buy this book already!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I wasn't planning to read Fifty Shades of Grey after all the hype about it - especially the tag of 'mommy porn'.  Being a middle aged mother, I just wasn't going to be part of the trend of reading this kind of material.  But...I relented.  Have to admit that I wasn't all that thrilled when I began reading it.  Thought the female main character was too unbelievable, thought the repetitive language was not a sign of a very well written book and the sex descriptions a little too explicit for my way of thinking.  (I did like the email exchanges with the interesting subject lines - found this to be the best part in all three books.)  Yes, I did go on to read the next two books in the series!  Although I didn't think the first one was all that good, I did like the way it ended and I was hooked.  I enjoyed the next two books more.  I heard the author explaining that it was a love story and after completing the series, I do think it truly was a love story.  Seeing the big changes occur in the male protagonist because of his love for a good woman was really enjoyable.  Not the best books I've read, but certainly an enjoyable read.  Glad I can now be part of the discussions about this book.

Martin has a way with words and keeping you hooked not just with a cliffhanger at the end but in the start, middle and end of his books that make you want to keep reading. I found myself thinking that there is a lot of setup but nothing really, really interesting going on then I read the next page and am like WTF!? I was planning on putting the next book off for a little while to wait closer to the next book but I am off to buy it now because I just have to know what happens to Arya, hopefully she is in the next one!<br />Amazing series from an amazing writer if for some reason you are reading this and have not started the series yet you really should asap!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 only dives farther into the story of Christian and Ana. Its just the right combination of romantic and sultry. I am not a reader, so to dedicate myself to a second book in a series its a major compliment! Its a must read!
B007VGXS8M|1.0|After you buy the app it tells u wen u open it tht u must also download an additional amount of Mb! I should be able to open it after and be able to play it right away but apparently 4 this app u must download additional stuff to play! It is outrageous! Do not waste ur money on this app! U r welcome!
0446541478|4.0|I found the book very interesting since it describes the elements of innovation that differentiate the case of Israel from other countries and is well documented. However in doing so one can feel the sales pitch a little heavy but since the authors have made a great deal of research I enjoyed their \\"sales pitch\\" for Israel's unique environment that fosters Innovation.<br />It is a must read for all who want to see a different side of Innovation elements.
0425263908|4.0|BARED TO YOU is book one in the Crossfire Series. This story is written in 1st person which I generally do NOT like, however I did enjoy it in this case. I have not read the Fifty Shades series but have a feeling this story will appeal to those who are fans of those books. I found the story to be engaging, HOT, and well written. I must say again it's HOT. The characters are realistic if a bit over the top at times. I did find the hero, Gideon a tad bit too much at times but overall enjoyed the story and hope to read the next one as well. Fans of hot, sexy, engaging tales will enjoy BARED TO YOU.<br /><br />Reviewed by Wendy Keel<br /><br />Rating 4<br /><br />Heat Rating: very very HOT
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that the Bible can read to me! there are times when I'm occupy doing things I can just play The Bible out loud and get the job done!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|To say I couldn't put it down would be an understatement! I am not a reader, but I had to see what all the fuss was about! boy am I glad I did! This book is perceved to be smut only! The thing is, there is such a powerful story to it also. Just when you think its getting a but too weird for you, something happens and BAM! You're hooked again!
0671027344|3.0|SPOILERS****<br /><br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is considered a young adult classic by many people and literary critics and with a movie coming out I decided it was high time I picked it up. As with many of the \\"critically acclaimed\\" novels I went in with high expectations and was in turn, somewhat disappointed. I'm not a literary snob by any means (I read the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants for Christ-sakes) but I am sometimes let down when I have certain ideas about what a book is going to be about.<br /><br />Charlie was a really nice character to read about. He had a very sweet demeanor and his personality was interesting. I think we're supposed to infer that Charlie is on the autistic spectrum, and his mind frankly does not seem like that of a 15/16 year old but that of someone much younger.<br /><br />However, I would argue that Charlie is not really a \\"wallflower.\\" Although he is definitely socially awkward, he is not shy by any stretch of the imagination. Actually his social life is booming. He goes to a party every week and has tons of really cool 90's hipster friends who do stuff like preform the \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" and hang out of cars while saying really cool 90's hipster things.<br /><br />Charlie also has no problem getting girls, but of course the only one he wants, Sam (whose main objective is to be really cool and say sensitive things, all while having a jerky boyfriend on the side) does not like him back. Not in that way.<br /><br />And of course there is the super cliche English teacher who decides that Charlie is just plain better than any student he's ever had- and tells him so. Seriously, read any book about a \\"not popular\\" teenager dealing with emotional issues and you will find the teacher who discovers that they are really the best person on the planet. Where was this teacher when I was in high school?<br /><br />To sum up this book is about as cliche ridden as any other teen novel out there (Charlie manages to somehow come by pretty much every \\"teen problem\\" a kid can come by in the span of one year), but the author has a much better and more unique voice than most YA authors today. It's worth a read.me by pretty much every \\"teen problem\\" a kid can come by in the span of one year), but the author has a much better and more unique voice than most YA authors today. It's worth a read.
B002YVAT72|2.0|Well the first shipment never made it past Jacksonville, Fl and somehow UPS said Amazon had to resolve the problem. But, Amazon did resolve the problem by overnight shipping a new unit, which was delivered to my door in less than 24 hours after my call. That was the good news. The not so good news is the unit works well and everything works just as it should, but the sound quality is really missing. On some old country albums that I have, the electric steel guitar is completely missing from the songs. This is very disturbing when it gets to that part and all you hear is the rhythm and no steel guitar. It is almost as if a channel is off or someone forgot to start playing.
B007V508CC|2.0|gone are the days of songs about jane.. now it sounds just like another techno pop group.. sorry but that is just the way i feel about this
B005LAIGYQ|3.0|Maybe a little heavy on action, light on plot, but I'm not going to knock it for that. The fact that current Navy Seals were used in the filming did pique my interest enough to convince me to watch it.<br /><br />Not too bad, but as I watched I found myself thinking \\"hey, this is Tears of the Sun!\\"<br />I remember seeing the original trailer over a year ago, and thought the same - even the music in that original trailer reminded me of Tears of the Sun (which has one of my favorite soundtracks).<br /><br />Reading various reviews, it seems Act of Valor gets a higher rating than Tears of the Sun.<br />Well now I'm conflicted AND confused?
B004EPYZUS|4.0|This high octane action picture stars Tom Cruise in his usual role as Ethan Hunt. It opens with a tech ally (played by Simon Pegg) helping cruise escape from a highly guarded prison in Moscow. What then follows is his team trying to get the launch codes for a bunch of nuclear weapons from a terrorist (played by Michael Nyqvist), who plans to use them to start World War III.<br /><br />The twists and turns and suprises, as well as the action scenes, are satisfying. Some are believable and some are up for your vote. What did you expect? That's how this series rolls.<br /><br />My favorite scenes were the early prison break out and the mid fight against the female villain lieutenant's character.<br /><br />Also starring Anil Kapoor (that old rogue of sorts who was the TV personality in \\"Slumdog Millionaires\\"), Paula Patton, Josh Halloway (a small role and yes that's the guy from LOST), Lea' Seydoux (the female villain lieutenant) and cameos by Michelle Monaghan and Ving Rhames.<br /><br />This is the fourth installment of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series. Cruise and Pegg are interested in a fifth installment. The budget was $145M and it made over $693M at the Box Office. No chump change here.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; TWISTS AND TURNS/SURPRISES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B000006YYW|4.0|Robin's solo albums are so very rare I was thrilled to be able to get this one. I do like Secret Agent a little better but 'How Old Are You' is a close 2nd !!  If only I could get Robin's Reign. It's easy to digitally download all his albums but I'm such a fan, I wanted the actual CD !!  Shopping with Amazon is always fast and easy.

B0060AY6FO|4.0|I enjoyed this book with the fun combination of a mystery and the famous Darcy's and Bennet's and it being set at Pemberley.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i love it and im answering somones question to delete just swipe there card and delete i love this game its so funn
0439023521|3.0|I loved the book.Loved the drama, action, romance. But I realized that it so resembled the \\"reality\\" shows on TV today. Survivor, Bachelor/bachelorette, Next Chef/Model/Designer. Look at the characters! Pure casual entertainment.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I think I've only ever read one other Stephen King book; but, this book makes me want to read them all! What an amazing story. The pace picks up so gradually, you don't even realize that you are thinking about it when you're not reading it - and reading it until you fall asleep. I find I am enjoying time-travel books and this one is added to the list. There aren't too many books I would want to re-read; but, this is one. I now see what all the fuss it about! Signed - a new, die-hard Stephen King fan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun app I like playing it sometimes and I am very good at most games, thanks for great app!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Draw Something is fun and keeps me connected to my kids.  I really, really like to play this game.  It is kind of like charades but helps keep loved ones (already at a distance) close.

0684857219|5.0|This book came to my by its being highly recommended by multiple people at my gym. Its a mammoth but the reading content is jam packed full of useful information. My only complaint is that the binding on the books spine started to give, had to super glue it back. Other than that, awesome book. I'd recommend it as THE quintessential fitness book for anyone.
0385339585|5.0|WOW!!!!  Excellent book!!  Definitely in my TOP 10!!!!  A page-turner with an above average strong message and story line!  I read other reviews when I'm about to submit my own and it surprises me to read the 1-Star reviews for this book.  All I can think of is they did not expect the Christian strain throughout the story and perhaps it was offensive ?  Who knows.  I usually read Inspirational Fiction because I just don't see the need for the excessive language in the average American Novel!  When I ran out of my stack of books, I picked up a John Grisham that was laying around  thinking it'll at least be a good page turner.  Was a wonderful surprise!!  Saying he's a gifted writer is a given, but I so appreciated the excellent message and \\"lesson\\" if you will!  Thank you John Grisham for keeping me at the edge of my seat!!
B005AKFXZW|3.0|I find this book very difficult to review. On the one hand it was an amazing story concept. I loved it. But with a few exceptions, I found the characters insubstantial and felt a lack of connection.<br />The switching of time was difficult to keep up with - especially on a Kindle.<br />I thought the book was generally too long and I enjoyed the second half twice as much as the first.<br />Having made all those criticisms, I AM glad I read it and admire the breadth of imagination it took to write it
0345803485|5.0|This book was great... Kept me very interested.  I would recommend it to anybody over the age of 18... Kind of explicit in some parts...
B007SGM084|5.0|OMG! These books will have you on an emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey will peak your interest & draw you in & you cant pull yourself away.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker, when Christian fell to his knees in front of Anastasia, I was just speechless for it took my breathway for that spoke volumes!!<br /><br />Fifty Shades, Free lefted me speechless.<br /><br />I enjoyed these book. Any adult that loves a good love story.. this is 1 to have.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I'm actually going back to watch this movie again. It has a very rich story line and the characters have depth. There is so much to take it from watching the movie that there is no way to get all the details from one viewing. Amazing CGI too.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|nice game,, story line a bit lame. nice time waster. puzzles are fun, but a bit easy for some. froze once on my kindle so far.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very enjoyable for all. :) You will be playing for hours. This game is very addictive you will not want to stop playing.
1610454812|5.0|My son is in the Army Special Forces. This book hit close to home for me. I also attended Lake Hamilton High School so it was as if I were visiting an old friend!! Well written and a \\"must read\\" for anyone who calls themselves American!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing on the kindle fire. I LOVE this game!! Although some of the ratings are VERY bad you should not listen to what those people have to say because like I said before this app is AMAZING!!
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is very entertaining and it can keep me entertained for hour on end and it just keeps going and going with the coins
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is a great example of what money or lack of it makes people do. It shows how meat is processed, critical conditions in which animals are kept in big farms, and how much farmers are paid. On the other hand, it shows the benefits of eating organic food and how \\"organic animals\\" are treated. It's a good tool to gauge what you will choose to include on your menu next time you cook.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Great app/game to kill time with, but where did these damn ADs come from??? Small simple 1s are 1thing, but these things that take a couple minutes to load are getting really irritating... WHY? WHY? WHY??? I'm playing Solitare I couldn't care less about Lexus cars. Otherwise its a functional game. Samsung Epic 4g.
1582701709|5.0|This book has totally changed my life!  It is beautifully written; each chapter has a power point summary. I have told all my friends about this book, I even bought an extra to lend to those who were sceptical about buying it and guess what they are all ordering their own! I was so lost with what was going on in my life and this book helped set me free!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Other reviews have done a much better job describing the story, so I will simply say this book was fun to read, hard to put down, and the plot kept me guessing from start to finish. I found myself relating to the characters, and caring about thier fate. The combat and tactics seemed very believable and true to the time periods, which I rarely see in fantasy.
B003ZA0BCY|3.0|All and all a good movie. Brendan dose a good job pulling off an idiot with Zero social skills! It was worth the rent. Won't rent it again!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|This app is a fun way to pass the time. Searching for items can be a challenge but not overly so to the point of frustration. I think it would be fun for the younger sect but I enjoyed it too, so, good for a variety of ages. Good fun!
B007SGM084|5.0|i'm feeling sad now that i've completed this series. it's simply a love story of a broken man and the lucky woman who saved him. i want more of christian please!

0345803493|1.0|The characters as well as the relationships lack depth. The book is touted as a romance but is not romantic-erotic maybe to someone out there but I bet not to most untwisted people. I'm just sorry that I wasted good money and my limited time on this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very entertaining and would highly recommend for all to play from the little one and up. diffulty does change as you increase in the boards so there is hours of fun.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Ok so I pay for this and then I play it. It was the best game ever! Until I had to pay forDoodle devil. It was inappropriate. Then when I got half way I started to play Doodle God. I bought the download to open everything and they just took my money! I couldn't even open the game. Don't get this game!!!!!!!!!!!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|For any moviegoer who can sit still, and absorb intelligent dialogue along with a suspenseful storyline --- this film is for you.  There's a stellar cast -- and brilliant acting.  Sorry, no explosions or superheros -- well maybe one superhero -- George Smiley.
B00005AXEL|1.0|the cd was not wrapped or sealed and the playing surface was so ravaged that no cd player could play it so i had to throw it away.
B0087240Z4|5.0|Absolutely awesome. Best album I have heard in years. Gets better everytime I hear it.  Pumpkins are back. Bigger and better than ever. Woohoooo
B0000C4GAM|4.0|When looking to upgrade and making that shift from either beginner to intermediate to pro, this piece of glass is well worth the investment. The morning I got this I went straight from the camera store, to a skateboard event, to shooting a save the date to pulling over to a dirt road to shooting some stars. They all turned out crisp and clear on my 600d body, even at 25%,50%,75% and 100% crops the images were still amazing.<br />  Now it's not perfect but it's not faulty by any means. This lens preformed best outside and in the sun under bright light and early evening with a decent flash. Night shooting isn't the best but I'm sure you could make it work with the proper settings. My only other complaint would be the lack of IS in the lens. Some images can come out fuzzy or have a small amount of motion blur, this could also have been user error as the weight of both this new lens and a grip threw me a little off.<br />  For the price and quality this is a great lens and should become an essential part of your kit.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I am unable to down load the free stuff because you are asking for USA credit card and address. is this used only in USA.  if it free why do you want credit card and address I am in Tobago. please explain. I do not see the need for a credit card if the things are free. I am confused.
0393088774|4.0|I really liked this book as it took some pretty heavy material and made it easy to read and understand.  Krugman did a great job of not getting too professorial/academic in explaining the cause of our current situation in the U.S., The Great Depression, and the current crises in Europe.  Overall, a very good read.
145470246X|5.0|Having taken classes with the author I knew I was purchasing a gem.  Her ideas and directions are impecable and I look forward to her next book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Over all this is a fun game. The only problem I have had is getting gameloft to recognize that I am playing and have not been able to add any neighbors yet.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I honestly could not understand what all the hype was about over this book after I had read it. The writing is high school as she attempts to throw in a bunch of big words to make it seem more sophisticated. As I read, I envisioned someone editing this on their computer and clicking on words using the thesaurus feature trying to change their basic word choice into more complicated vocabulary choices. Sometimes it worked, other times not well. The sex/bondage scenes were not very well-developed either and I found myself annoyed by the weak-willed female main character more than enthralled with the \\"action\\". I am not certain what the author's intent was in writing this book but if it was to show how liberating some sexual choices can be, I find that it did exactly the opposite. I was not at all impressed and will not purchase the next two books in this sad trilogy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is really really great<br />You can play in the morning<br />You can play it real late!<br />play it player!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I love this series. It's a great sci-fi with all of the crazy events happening in it. It also has very appealing characters. I love the whole cast. The main trio of Olivia, Peter and Walter are great together. The story lines are filled with lots of scientific information and I love the concept that they are going for. Having Walter's past shaping their future is an impressive idea when everything gets tied together. All in all, it's an incredible show that is worth every second in front of the tv. :)
0307951529|4.0|I enjoy Chris Guillebeau's blog and looked forward to reading this book. He did not disappoint. I found it engaging. But you should know the following before deciding whether to buy:<br /><br />1) The $100 figure is an approximation designed to sell books, and does not include resources / skills already on hand.<br />Many of his case studies were people who converted a hobby into a business. Meaning a lot of his case studies had already committed thousands of dollars and hours into building their skills and networks. But others were pretty close to being \\"clean sheet\\" businesses, i.e. not based on strong prior investments. But that's part of his point -- the reader may already have resources that have not been activated for business.<br /><br />2) It's not really a blueprint or treasure map -- but it is more than a vague set of ideas. A compass might provide a better metaphor.<br /><br />3) The chapter about roaming might not make any sense unless you know more about how Chris works.<br /><br />4) Despite his general bent against corporate employment, many of his case studies depend on the corporate world for their success -- for example, figuring out the best deals in travel. Better to be a remora living on the outside of the shark than to be on the shark's inside...<br /><br />I would have liked a bigger chapter on hustling. But his opinion of conventional franchising should be required reading for aspiring entrepreneurs.

B00785P2QC|5.0|i like i find it adicting and better than some facebook games its fun I would recommend it to my friends
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie had me at the title (well, ALMOST!  It had me with the title AND seeing Steve Carrell, Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling were in it!)  This movie has some all-time funny lines ever....and for those who have seen it, you KNOW it has one of the FUNNIEST & SURPRISING scenes toward the end!  This is difficult to review without giving away any secrets, so you'll have to trust me when I say the writing, THE WRITING!.....I WISH I could write like that!  Every single actor is at the top of their game, too.  I highly recommend Crazy Stupid Love.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Fun game and worth the time. It is a search and find game with a plot.  If that is up your alley, give out a try
1595141715|5.0|This book was just PHENOMENAL. It gives anyone who reads it a whole new perspective in everything that they do. Some of the things listed on Hannah Baker's tapes don't seem all that bad, but then you read about the way in which they affected her, and it really makes you think about your actions towards the people around you. This book had me hooked from the time I started reading it. This is what should be required reading in the school curriculum, not Huckleberry Finn and To Kill a Mockingbird. While this book is listed as a young adult novel, I honestly think that adults should read it too to get a look at what teens are thinking and doing. All in all, this is one of the best books I've ever read, and I hope that it is as much a blessing to everyone else that reads it as it was to me.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I really enjoy this app! My pictures are so much better now! Posting to Facebook and Twitter is easy and fun!
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This one comes with a warning.....totally, TOTALLY, inappropriate!  I am SHOCKED that I like it!  This is as risque as it gets for me, and I will still like a movie.  Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are awesomely funny, and their characters are SO WELL-WRITTEN!  This movie has been done before (two people change into each other's bodies accidentally, there are LOTS of outrageously funny situations because of this, and then they change back), but RARELY has it been done so well!  This is pretty vulgar but is done so exceedingly well that I have watched it a number of times with my 24 year old son.  Jason Bateman is Dave, a married conservative, successful lawyer with twin babies who is trying for a partnership in his firm.  Ryan Reynolds is Mitch, an immature dolt of a wanna be actor whose main goal in life is bedding every woman he can, sleeping 'til noon and having fun.  One night they pee in a fountain and wake up the next morning in each other's bodies!  I can't begin to explain the clever situations the writers thought of to exploit every bit of humor from this.  This movie is full of surprises and laughs!  Gotta love both of those, right?  The supporting actors are wonderful, too.  I recommend this movie!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|So I tried this book upon all the other good recommendations by reviewers. I picked out one of the exercises (talking to yourself positively about something specific) and it worked!!! It's hard to do the exercises in bed if there's someone sleeping next to you that might laugh, so when I had my acupuncture done, or was alone for a few minutes, I would do the exercise. You can also mouth the words without speaking them. I said them with feeling just like the books says.<br /><br />I actually started this book before I tried acupuncture...was looking for something to help my health. Acupuncture has helped me so much. So while I was completely relaxed in acupunctures sessions, I would do my subconcious mind exercises over and over and over. Wow! Here I am, my career about to take off, my home life exactly how I like, and my health improving.<br /><br />Try it!
B006964E8S|4.0|As good as I expect from David Baldacci. Pace is good and story line is fast paced.  A very good read.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Fun game. Not wild about it wanting to connect to Facebook for posting achievements.  Cheesy story line and graphics are okay but still a fun game. The mini games are fun and varied. I wouldn't say its terribly difficult but enough to make it interesting and fun to do.
B004ODLUF8|5.0|I saw this as a 3D IMAX film at the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex.  I absolutely loved it and immediately went to purchase the video to be able to watch again and again at home.  What is so amazing is how the detail transmitted by the Hubble telescope can be rendered, digitally, into a journey right into the Orion nebula and other celestial bodies.  The clarity and depth are amazing, as is the new information we now have about the birth of solar systems, etc.  The cinematography is stunning.  A truly beautiful film equally appropriate for both children and professional astronomers--indeed, anyone who would like a closeup glimpse into the amazing universe around us.
006207993X|4.0|Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a story like nothing that I've read before. At first, I was confused as to how people were able to breath and live on Mars. I had to remind myself that it is of course a work of fiction. Nevertheless, these loosely related short stories tied together into a full length novel in an artful way. This story is unique in and of itself and should be read by any child interested in space or any adult who grew up reading Ray Bradbury.<br />Zachary B. Medina<br />Author of Decador

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is pretty good. Nice graphics, music is catchy but wears thin from loops, and the story is interesting enough to keep you interested in what's goon to happen next.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Other reviewers have revealed what the basic story is about, so I won't waste time here.  I just want to include my praise of this book.  I found it intriguing and written in an interesting way, alternating between the voices of the husband and wife.  It was hard for me to put the book down as the twists and turns kept me turning pages.  My only complaint was the ultimate resolution.  I had to think about that awhile to realize that, of course, this was the only way it could end.
B0086700CM|5.0|They finally got this gave on Kindle Fire!  Great game! nothing wrong with it, worth the download. Awesome glad Amazon finally got it
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I like it. It's a fun game. Better than most. It has good graphics which makes it easier to figure out what object you need to find.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|It has been over thirty years since director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) made two highly influential, game-changing science fiction films, Alien and Blade Runner.  Now he revisits his earliest triumph, Alien, not as a sequel but as a kind of prequel that has threads connecting both films.  An intelligent science fiction film with elements of horror, Prometheus embraces bold concepts of human origin and its creation by `ancient astronauts'.  The film is not quite a classic, but should thoroughly satisfy purists and general moviegoers alike.<br /><br />An archeological couple has pieced together remarkable clues from early human drawings revealing a stellar map that may lead to the source of mankind.  The couple, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), join a crew and its Captain Janek (Idris Elba) on a two year mission to a mysterious planet aboard the spaceship Prometheus.  Financed by the Weyland Corporation and represented by Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the only non-human on board is an android named David (Michael Fassbender).  Prometheus lands near some structures which, upon investigation, reveal evidence of life, but the discovery has startling implications leading to a desperate struggle for survival that threatens the earth.<br /><br />The film is not without some surprises and plot twists, and without giving too much away, Scott likes to end his films with an ambiguous sense of hope.  There are some unanswered questions, however, and there is one glaring injustice that gets lost amid the film's fascinating conclusion.  One pivotal, incredible scene involves a remarkable, graphic emergency surgery that strains the limits of credibility, but nevertheless holds the viewers' agonized attention.<br /><br />The story has a compelling setup and when the crew goes inside the structure, they discover a series of chambers that takes the journey closer to potential answers or deadly threat.  It's like the ultimate funhouse of terrors.  It's also a safe bet that nasty things happen when curious humans meet invasive, alien life forms.<br /><br />Having to live up to its predecessor, Prometheus builds its own fascinating world and broadens storyline implications for future films. It's not Alien, whose novelty and groundbreaking creature designs stunned audiences, but there are certainly enough connections to draw parallels between the two films. Alien is referenced in several ways including bits of dialogue, a sampling of Jerry Goldsmith's original theme, and culminating with markedly familiar set pieces.  (Ironically Alien itself was a big budget reworking of a B-movie, It the Terror from Beyond Space.)<br /><br />The film does feel a bit derivative at times and borrows liberally from other science fiction classics.  The early scenes where David is the only conscious crew member who wiles away his solitary existence with basketball, watching holographic dreams of the hibernating crew, and admiring Lawrence of Arabia, harken back to the Discovery crew of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Some scenes are not original as they seem lifted right out of Alien vs. Predator, Leviathan and various episodes of TV's The X Files.<br /><br />Fassbender, who shines in the film, does a very convincing job imbuing his android with almost human characteristics and a potentially sinister side.  Think of 2001's disembodied computer HAL and you get the idea.  Strong female leads are a staple of Scott's films (Thelma and Louise), and Rapace is a strong female heroine whose faith is sorely tested amid personal loss and her obsessive hunt for the truth about mankind's beginnings.<br /><br />Cinematography has always been a strong point in Scott's films, and the film's stunning visuals display the planet's otherworldly beauty.  The production design is imaginative particularly inside the structure with its myriad of biomechanical architecture and impressive special effects.  Swiss artist H.R. Giger, who designed the original Alien monster, contributes a bit of reverse engineering that fans will appreciate.<br /><br />Prometheus is a thought provoking adventure that not only can stand on its own, but rises tall among most science fiction films.  It's a visually impressive epic with an ambitious agenda that doesn't completely work, but even so, this antecedent to Alien is a worthy bookend to the series.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is so addictive I don't want to do anything else! I play this all day...I'm so nervous of the day when I'm done with all the puzzles!
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I could not stop watching this concert. Maybe because I have waited so long for her to release a concert DVD. I mean, it is no Dream Within A Dream or Onyx dance wise but if you watch it for the sake of entertainment (not comparing it to the others that she have done.), you're gonna love it. Dream Within A Dream is by far the best Britney Spears concert dance and production wise [[ASIN:B00005UKKF Britney Spears - Live from Las Vegas]] but this is my favorite. I mean, the set list (who would've thought that she would sing S$M) the stage (It is the best I've ever seen!) and Britney herself seem to be enjoying it. I am fine with them dubbing the show, I really am not fond of the crowd noise but during the Till The World Ends number - the music doesn't sync up with her lips on the last Chorus s it looks like she is lip-syncing badly. But overall, it is a great and spectacular show.<br /><br />Hold It Against Me - the backdrop was so good. Her outfit kind of made her look fat though. The choreography is good. There is a little thing about the editing though (this show was shot for 2 nights), on the last Chorus of the song, you'll see that Brit was dancing while the screen at her back closes, then one scene it is still open. It is not noticeable though.<br /><br />Up 'N Down - AT the end of HIAM, Brit was caught by the cops, this song opens with her and her female dancers in a cage. I like how she escape from it and her dancing here is on fire.<br /><br />3 - And who said she can no longer dance????<br /><br />Piece Of Me - they could have omitted this number IMO.<br /><br />Big Fat Bass - not a fan of this song and I think, her dancer, Adrien Galo, stole the spotlight in this number.<br /><br />How I Roll - love this song. The choreography is real cute.<br /><br />Lace And Leather - Brit giving a lap dance to her stalker, I mean, fan... Alex.<br /><br />If You Seek Amy - one of the better performances, simple yet effective.<br /><br />Gimme More - the outfit shows off her figure. I wish this was the performance on the VMA '07.<br /><br />Drop Dead Beautiful - I always laugh when Sabi pops out on the stage.<br /><br />Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - This is officially an Adrien Galo show. Lol.<br /><br />Boys - nice concept.<br /><br />Baby One More Time - the second audio option gives you the live version of the song. It is really nice to hear Brit's 2011 version of this epic song.<br /><br />S&M - IMO Britney walks so gracefully, I have never seen any supermodel walk like that.<br /><br />Trouble For Me - I love this! The choreography is sooooooo good. This is one of the best songs off of Femme Fatale, it was not given that much attention so I was surprised that it is on the set list.<br /><br />Slave 4 U - Britney danced the original choreography, it is not the same as before, but at least she tried and it is really lovely to watch. Would've been better if they have not changed the vocals and put the 2000 track on.<br /><br />I Wanna Go - this has taken the toll of the dubbing thing. I have seen a video on YouTube if this exact performance plus the live audio and it is so much better, you can hear the audience singing along (Okay, I take back what I said about the crowd noise.) I mean, this song suppose to have the audience interaction but they have taken it away.<br /><br />Womanizer - My most favorite. This number was put up so well. The back flip is the heart of the performance, I mean, you cannot go to a Femme Fatale concert without taking a picture of Brit doing the back flip. You can see all the cameras round the arena during that epic moment. Britney has proven that she is still the ultimate performer.<br /><br />Toxic - I am not a fan of this number. This is the one that I skip. I mean, why they had to remix this epic song? Oh, well... Because Brit cannot dance to the original version.<br /><br />Till The World Ends - what a way to end the show, her best dancing the whole Femme Fatale era. And her angel wings??? Just wow.<br /><br />I might have some not so good feedback but I am giving this 5 stars because it is Britney b*tch! (I know, I should get a life.)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. I think out.of the trilogy its the best one and I would recommend it to everyone. Must read ASAP!!!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I got my kindle fire the day it came out.  I looked at a lot of covers and never did make a decision.  I was using a quilted bag that I made to carry the kindle.<br /><br />When I got this cover I was a bit skeptical about the way it fastened on to the kindle.  However the case actually stays on very well.  It fell off of a table and the case stayed on.  It is nice to have a sturdy cover that can be tightly closed over the kindle and this one serves the purpose very well.  One little advantage of having this cover, is that when I use the kindle while lying down, I have the problem of accidentally pushing the power button.  With the case the power button is recessed so not easy to push it by mistake.<br /><br />I have to admit that I am not much worried about looks but this case serves very well, and looks just fine to me.

1932100660|5.0|Getting healthy and losing weight is so simple to understand if you are getting your nutrition education from the right sources.<br />The China Study is one of the books that you can read that will clarify what you are doing to yourself living on the American diet. It will shock you when you learn about what animal protein really does to your health! I've been plant-based for two years and I've lost 45 lbs. and I feed good when I wake up. Read this book. Some other great books to check out are Sick of Being Fat and Reverse Heart Disease.
0307956350|5.0|As I started to read \\"the Expats\\", I did not quite like it because of the many jumps in time.  It made the plots confusing to me.  However, later on I realized that confusion was the key.  The complex deceits among the characters, the twisted yet intertwining personal histories, the fragmented time line, are all part of the toolbox that the author used skillfully to create the mental effect.<br />The book is a page-turner because of the suspense and twists.  Reading it is like piecing together a puzzle.  The picture is clear only at the last moment.  It is also a masterpiece in conveying a feeling of alienation.  Nobody can be taken at the face value.  No story is without a deeper story.  The setting of the plot, the foreign country and unsympathetic colleagues, adds to the mental effect.<br />The shortcoming, in my view, is that the author failed to present the real people behind all the camouflage.  The author spent much ink describing Kate, her internal conflicts between honesty and secrecy.  However, Kate sounds a lot like a man, instead of a woman.  As to her husband, Dexter, only a shadow was provided.  The other main characters are even shallower.  I guess it is a book more about the readers than about the characters.  If a reader can find resonance in the book, he will like it.

B0081KTI0E|5.0|I loved the movie.  I haven't been startled by horror movies in a while and I watched this on my laptop on the plane and I nearly jumped out of my seat.  Daniel Radcliffe is a good actor and sometimes I know it's hard for some to see him as other than Harry Potter but I think he did an excellent job on this film.  Ciaran Hinds is also one of my favorites.  The story is not a very complex one, that's true, but it was well played out. I also like that the ending was atypical.  This British period drama fanatic is very satisfied and I will buy this movie to add to my collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great tool for studying the Bible. I would reccommend this app to anyone who is wanting to dig deep into the word. having this app makes studying much easier.

B006DJ2JSI|4.0|The first dictionary on my Kindle was the Oxford American, the hardbound version of which I've happily used for decades. However, it did not make the transition to the digital world well. It's slow, awkward, and difficult to use in a meaningful way. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary I got from the Amazon store has none of these shortcomings. It's simple to use, comprehensive and very user-friendly. The only thing keeping it from getting five stars in my estimation is the lack of regular expression searches or at the very least the * and ? wildcard search. That would bump it up to five stars quite easily.

0345803493|5.0|I love this series!!  It starts off a little dark but all in all it has a great story line and it keeps you wondering what will he or they do next.  I get lost in the story and just cant get enough.  This is definitely one series I will read again in the future.  Happy reading to all.  If you are not open minded it probably isn't for you.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The title of this book captured my attention: \\" Wild.\\" So, I thought, \\"Yes, I'll read a book about a powerful woman!\\" Also, Oprah endorsing it for her new book club was a plus. I had read prior reviews that said Cheryl Strayed came off as \\"whiny\\" in writing about her long hike. Unfortunately, they were correct. She relates story after story about her insular, poverty stricken childhood with her free spirited, Bohemian mother. Her life is chaotic but happy until her mother dies, and years of drug use, misery and promiscuity ensue. I would have been able to tolerate this, if when she began the hike she had been prepared. But, we learn she fails to take enough money to buy food, she brings the wrong fuel for her camping stove, she buys boots that are too small, she overloads her backpack, she overestimates how many miles she will hike each day and she carries no weapons of any kind to protect herself, other than a whistle. Instead of coming off as an Amazonian princess, she just seems hapless and self defeating. Bill Bryson's book, \\"A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, \\" is still the best hiking memoir I've come across.

1451648537|5.0|This is an incredibly well written biography. I've been a huge fan of Apple and Steve since 2000 and found his story amazing, but I feel the author told it in a way that even a regular consumer of few Apple products would enjoy. While long, I finished the whole thing without feeling any moments of boredom. I highly recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|know wht i dont care if people dont like this app but dont freakin tell people your opinion that its stupid i mean realy you make people not try it out so wht its their problem i like it so if you dont like the app then dont say anything &quot;it freezes it doesnt work its stupid dont buy it SHUT UP!you make me sick read this and say wht you want i dont care make fun of me see wht happens say i have problems but i dont have feelings mybe you need to shutup and get a life. so like it or shut it people try to make FREE GAMES you try to create a game oh wait you dont know how to so like i said ether like it or shut it
0385736002|2.0|A storyline that's been told again and again. Cookie cutter characters abound as good overcomes evil in this hackneyed tale of two young people. Yes I know it's YA but that's no excuse for the shallow storyline and predictable plot and repetitive dialogue. When the author pulls out the all pervasive \\"prophecy\\" plot tool all you can do is roll your eyes and plod on.<br /><br />I think the author is confused on what an archeologist is and does and confuses it with an anthropologist or paleontologist a number of times
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is my all time favorite! I absolutely love it! It was so good. Suzanne Collins did an AMAZING job writing this book! She transports you into the book and you feel like you are Katniss and you want to survive the Games. I read the first 2 books in one day, I could not put it down. I re-read them over 20 times before I got the 3rd book. I own all 3 and re-read them again and again. I am the books #1 fan.  &#60;3
B004J2TPSI|5.0|Easy to use. Just flip the on/ off switch to the on position and wait until the blue light flashes before holding in the on button on the earpiece to pair it. Continue to press until the light pattern changes, then release the button and wait for the rapid twice heartbeat of the light on the earpiece. When far away from the transmitter around its thirty feet limit, it will start to break up, turn your head so the button side is towards the unit as the head will block the signal path. I ordered three to last the whole entire day. The black unit allows me to enjoy a stronger sound volume than the white color unit. Hence, I returned the white and ordered more of the black Kokkia. Thank You Kokkia.

B007FDE4Y8|4.0|I spent ages reviewing various stabilizers before I bought this one. This was the one which seemed the closest in build and design to the well regarded Merlin Steadicam yet is less that 25% of the price. It is well constructed and solid and has a good and accurate adjustment system which is very important for a good stabilizer. There is only a 1 page instruction which is not much good. I learned how to set it up from a couple of videos on youtube from users and also by looking at the merlin setup on you tube too which is similar principle. It took me about and hour to get the basic balance  but the perfect balance is more elusive, but comes with practice. It still needs regular adjustment to keep balance. But then having read reviews for all these stabilizers (merlin included) users report the same issues..it just takes hours of practice to get good at it. But in my experience after a couple of hours you can get use-able and relatively impressive results, maybe not perfect but 1000 percent better than just shaky handheld. I use a canon 600D with battery grip and manfrotto baseplate and a 18-55 kit lens and it balances quickly. I had problems trying to balance the same camera with my heavier 24-105 L lens and after an hour gave up and then moved to the much easier to set up kit lens. Maybe i will revisit this again. I shot some good shots the next day and include a link to the video i shot using it the following day after about 4 or 5 hours practice on it.    [...]    Dont buy any stabilizer if you get easily frustrated ... but if you practice and persevere the results imho are worth it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|9.99 for 382 pages I think not! After reading many bad reviews I will keep my 10 dollars and wait for Sherrilyn Kenyon's next book which has sex and vampires(or vampire like creatures ;) ) it's like twilight all over, those not exposed to excellent authors think it's good but it really is bad.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I had never tried a JM video before, and I work out a lot...so I was a little worried that it would not be intense enough for me. However, I have been pleasantly surprised overall. Since I am in pretty good shape, Level 1 was fairly easy. I am on Level 2, which is a good workout. Surprisingly, I think Level 2 is actually more challenging than Level 3 (which I tried once out of curiosity). I think this DVD will be a great supplement for days that I'm not able to go to the gym. Also, I have been combining it with her kickboxing routine.<br /><br />The one VERY annoying thing about this DVD is that you have to watch her stupid intro EVERY time. You can't fast forward and you can't get to the main DVD menu without watching the whole darn thing. I don't think I would buy another video just based on that. Sounds petty, but it's a waste of at least 5 minutes, and when you are in a hurry that's a lot.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|the premise of the book sounded very appealing. What I didn't expect was a life story that was very touchIng and instrumental to her success in achieving her goal. Her first day on the trail was so difficult that most people would have given up saying it was a complete mistake. But she had something in her that kept her going. Solitary hiking & camping can be very intimidating when you're so far from civilization, especially the nights. And her relentless desire to keep going when you know she's really suffering physically.

B000G8NXYG|2.0|I do believe many people give this film high marks simply because film critics say so. Speaking of overated how about Grand Illusion and Rules of the Game. Do not get me wrong I love foreign films such as The Cranes are Flying,  Rififi, Germany Year Zero,and The Passion of Joan of Arc. I really tried to see what amazes and overwhelms most everyone but I guess it passed me by. An excruciatingly boring drivel with terrible acting.
B007EC6FIS|4.0|Missing something, but overall very good. Needs a little uptempo and a little toughness. But then again, nice to see the band back to their roots. For mellow music - definitely very good! Like all songs. Excellent mellow background cd - or driving cd, very nice, soft, caring, feel good kind of music.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read this book after it had been recommended on a radio book review programme. The reviewer said \\"this is the book they've all been talking about and it's selling like hot potatos\\"<br />Well, I struggled to finish this book, a sado-masochistic love story between a 27 year old billionaire and a 21 years old english literature student who, incidentally, was a virgin prior to meeting the billionaire. The characters are simply not credible and the book has no literary significance. I cannot recall a decent line in the whole book. Put simply, it's a dreadful book and it's soft porn, but it even fails in respect of the latter.<br />I would not recommend this book to any prospective readers.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I love Lungs and was excited to listen to Ceremonials. I was not disappointed at all. Ceremonials is just as good as lungs -- I just can't stop listening to it. The vocals are beautiful, the lyrics are thoughtful and the instrumental is powerful. I can't wait to listen to this album over and over and it only makes me that more excited for a future album if the first two were this great.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|Warner Home Video has confirmed that this set contains the NBC broadcast episodes, and NOT the extended episodes that were previously released on DVD. According to TVShowsOnDVD, \\"The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release.\\"  For that reason, I sadly cannot give this product any more than two stars.
B007L96SI6|5.0|Because the best song: SPIDERWEB is on the deluxe cd. The entire cd is very good and has a retro theme. It does not sound like current music at all except Oh my and Free. Spiderweb is my favorite song. WOW!
B0067TGSOK|4.0|The book is nicely written, personal and inspiring tone. It includes a lot of stories of various nicheµ businesses, but you won't find too many details of them. The book covers different possible setups for building a business, but in an introductional manner. Revenue/profit figures are mentioned here and there, but none of the cases are covered in a very detailed matter. Typically the author draws some general guidance comparing a few different businesses, rather than doing deeper case studies of each separately. This is more of an introductional and eye-opening book to the topic of micropreneurship, and could be maybe read at the same time with 4-hour-workweek.<br />But if you're already read a lot of material around the topic and are further ahead with your business thinking and planning, you won't find any details to help you here - in that case it's more of an inspirational/reaffirmational read, with just a few nuggets. Nice quick read nevertheless.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Its an ok game. Great time waster. I'll be playing again for sure, just only when nothing else catches my interest. Really not seeing what the fuss is about. Works well on KF.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Yeah, I finally finished the Fever series! Only a year and a half late to this party, but reading this series was still phenomenal. 'Shadowfever' is by far the longest book in this 5 part series and if you think you've got it all figured out then...well, I'm sure there are still some surprises left. I can't really go into much of this book, since I have no interest in giving you spoilers. So I'll just get to the point. This book is fantastic, almost every question is answered, nothing seems to go exactly as expected, and there are times were the plot twist just slap you in the face. Best of all there are no neat little bows on everything. Mac, annoyed me slightly in the first book, and I've grown to really like her because she feels real. She's not perfect, FAR from it and she makes TONS of mistakes throughout the series. She's a flawed character, so I find her more relateable, sometimes you just want to shake some sense into her. So the series comes to a conclusion, kind of. There is a lot left to expand this series, and as it turns out it is being expanded by at least TWO more novels. Needless to say this is now one of my top favorite series and I can't wait to continue the journey in the Fever world.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|to easy on some of the items. but other that I am enjoying it.I wish that there were more hidden object games at amazon, that I could buy and know that it was the whole game because when we are camping there is no wifi to get the rest of the game, if they would tell in the description I would fill my kindle full of them just so I would have them for camping. our next trip is going to be for a whole month. by the way I love my kindle, we are going to buy another one.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Fun pictograph game. Some are easy, normal, hard. It is cool when picture is completed. Download it and get hooked.
B0086700CM|5.0|they must be putting nicotene on the screen cuz this is addictive. awesome. the bad reviews are such lies this is so cool. I luv tr!
1451627289|5.0|I'd never read a Stephen King book until coming across this title, which is not about monsters, aliens or outright horror. It's a wonderful volume that caused me to slowly reread some resonating passages -- such is King's captivating authorship on a great number of topics. Certain passages, such as the protagonist (a high school English teacher) reluctantly instructing by way of rivers on red ink on student essays, really struck a chord. \\"11/22/63\\" made me such a fan that I'm now enjoying his \\"On Writing\\" and look forward to \\"Tommyknockers\\" (which a friend gave me).
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Simple yet resonate. Fast yet with a solid, even tempo. The depths of the soul aren't spelunked, but this is a fun, fast, radio-friendly hit. It's easy to recoil and hate it instantly, if you're a certain type. But if you're not, if you're open to a simple yet exciting (not to mention, like every other reviewer, damned catchy) pop tune meant to entertain, you will enjoy \\"Call Me Maybe.\\" Just listen, drive around, retract the sunroof.
B001J4E1D8|3.0|I agree with another reviewer and found the lead actress to be completely uninteresting in this role.  When I watch masterpiece theater I expect fantastic acting especially from the lead character and I didn't get it here. However I did enjoy the actor who played Angel and thought he did a fine job.  The story is depressing so without fantastic acting I just didn't see the point of watching. The actress playing Tess says most of her lines in the exact same whiny inflection.  I found myself confused as to whether I should feel sorry for her or annoyed by her.  All in all I'd say it was ok... but not worthy of masterpiece.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|enjoyed the game,  I got the full game as the freebie and am enjoying it thanks<br />hoping there will be more along this line soon?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I've read a lot of books, but this seems to stand out in a way the amazes me. I'm impatiently looking forward to seeing the movie version.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it so does my brother it fun and easy for kids and I reccamend it to everybody its really good
B0086700CM|5.0|great graphics, fun for all. my kids and I take turns playing.  as my son said, &quot;it's good.&quot;  I am looking forward to the next version.
B007VT6QSI|1.0|for listening to this music.. its fake computers.. No originality...basically anybody that has a face can do this crap..If Bieber grows some balls some day, he will make his own music without computers and pro tools and all that. Seriously.. The kid may have a voice...but can we hear the real thing? Listen to some real musicians.. you might have to go back in time though because this is the fake crap being produced to be popular these days.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|have a lot of fun playing this game with family an friends and its funny to watch the pictures develope and trying to figure out what it is
B0076NKNLA|5.0|This is a highly interesting film well worth viewing, whether a fan of Marilyn Monroe or not, and well timed since August will mark the 50th anniversary of her death. Amazing that Marilyn still generates so much interest and has as big a mystique and charisma as ever.<br /><br />This film takes place in 1956, when Marilyn traveled to England to film The Prince and the Showgirl with Laurence Olivier. Michelle Williams captures the essence of Marilyn brilliantly. Ms. Williams deservedly won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Marilyn is difficult, temperamental, neurotic, but undeniably dazzling and talented. Kenneth Branagh is perfect as Olivier and was also Oscar nominated. The friction Olivier experiences with Marilyn and with her acting coach/mentor, Paula Strasberg, is well portrayed.<br /><br />The special features go behind the scenes and are fascinating. Highly recommended DVD and very entertaining.
B000001F7R|5.0|Maybe not as polished and filled with ballads girls like, but this album is a real collection of music. Some of the best guitar solos are in this record. This is the only album where Rick Savage actually sounds like a bass player and not like a machine.  Some people and even some members of the band are not too fond of this album. But this is their FIRST! and for being their debut album I think it sounds way better than other band's first.<br /><br />For those familiar with the 1992 song \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", let me tell you, if you Wanna Get Mildly Rocked, stay with your soft Leppard. Now if you REALLY Wanna Get Rocked, 'On Through The Night' and the follow up 'High N' Dry' should be in your collection.<br /><br />To wrap up. This is not a \\"well, it's their first, let's try to like it\\".  When you keep listening to the music in your mind after listening to it a few times and then years and years go by and you still keep hearing this music in your head it's because it is really good. This album never died and never will.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|If you like to check out the weather a lot,Then this is worth it for free! The only problem I have is most of the time when I go on it, it's not updated. Fix this,Please!
B00338QENI|4.0|In between that narrative the author discusses the sciences behind, ethics of informed consent in medical research (people were injected with HeLa - cancerous - cells without being informed), debate about the ownership of discarded body parts and the intellectual property of cells, large biological companies knocking out small government seed-funded laboratories, scientists who have to fund their frontier pushing research out of their own pocket for which they did not benefit monetarily, and Skloot's own surreal experience of tracking down the Lacks and the associated (some overly focused, or rather heartless) scientists.
B000001E21|5.0|Thought by some like a collection of left overs....not at all! This album is a real treasure.  It was nice to listen to this after Adrenalize (or how I like to call it, \\"Let's try to sound like Hysteria again\\"). This one is a bit obscure. Is like mixing the roughness of the first years with the spirit of Hysteria & Pyromania.  It also have some great ballads and some relaxed songs.  If you listen to this album and don't like most of the material, then you might as well say you don't like classic Def Leppard because that's exactly what it is, a real classic.  Also, you'll get a chance to listen to Steve Clark again. Some of these songs were already recorded and then remixed and revised for this CD. For instance, in some songs they simply re-recorded some instrument or added a few things here and there, but the core of the songs is what was recorded while with Mr. Clark.  This is even better than Adrenalize!! PS - The electric version of \\"Miss You In A Heartbeat\\" came first, in fact it was the B-Side from \\"Make Love Like a Man\\" and is 10 better than the boring acoustic version.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's a pretty good game. The graphics aren't the best.It crashes sometimes.There should be a couple more different ways of playing it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I just downloaded this app and its so much fun. I really enjoy this type of game, it keeps your mind busy. I wouldnt hesitate on getting this app if you enjoy puzzles where you need to search for hidden items. The bonus is it actually has a story to it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is an awsome game. There is a varety of games and when u finish ir get tired of a game u could unlock and play other games. I give it 5 stars
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun. So many games. Wish it didn't cost so many points to play games the further I get.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A little bit of everything for everyone. If you can't find something in this compilation you like something is wrong with you.
B0086700CM|4.0|its really good but when you had played a lot you get tired of it.<br />but have really good graphics.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|If you like Jeffrey Deaver or the like, you're going to love this book.<br />The blurb \\"Before I go to Sleep meets Sleeping with the Enemy\\" is apt. But what makes it really different is the structure. Skipping from the past to the present is a bit jarring at first, but after the first few chapters, it is completely compelling. Found it hard to put down.<br /><br />As a domestic violence survivor, I can tell you, the facts are accurate.<br /><br />Elizabeth's timing is dead on -- the tension starts high, and ratchets up from there. Don't pick it up unless you have hours to spend, because you won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />Best debut book I've read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fun passing time app to play. it may not be the funnest but its still fun to play. and they have lots if games for you to play once you play the first they give you, you earn points/coins and you can buy games with your earned points.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is very fun and very addicting!!!!! I could stay up all night and play it. great puzzle game as well. love it love it love it!!!!!!
B006H3MIV8|4.0|If I have a unique perspective, it is this: I got this set from the library and it didn't contain the booklet.  Therefore, every time I wanted to know an artist's name, I had to eject and read the disc.  Thus, I did it sparingly and only after versions I found particularly interesting/arresting.  Here's my point: I was not prejudiced against the artist prior to hearing the song (Un-Amnesty-International-Like-Confession: I probably would have been prejudiced had I done so...\\"Miley Cyrus????...How dare she sing BOB????!\\"  Full disclosure: I've watched Hannah Montana with my teenage girls.  Prejudice justified!  But I really liked it and was humbled by my discovery.)<br /><br />That's why I can't agree with the piling on of performances by Miley Cyrus or Kesha, to name a few.  I had to actually pop the CD out just to see who it was--and I did for theirs.  Now, I didn't skid off the road as a result of their performances (listened to all songs in car) but I was sufficiently intrigued.  I thought Miley's a very nice rendition (it's a nice, light version of a nice, light song) and, yes, Kesha's version was at first a surprise but it soon seemed to me appropriate, and especially appropriate for AI: without putting too fine a point on it, I saw her version as a, bear with me, physically/emotionally bruised woman ending(?) an abusive relationship.  To me, her voice came from the corner of a room...dark...sniveling...and alone.  It seemed an exceptional--and moving--interpretation of the song when viewed that way.  And aren't interpretations, rather than mere impersonations, what we want from a collection like this; giving credit to both artists?<br /><br />Essentially, the more non-Bob-like the versions, the better (Cage the Elephant's Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll seems the only way it could be handled outside of straight-on folk).  If I want to hear a Bob version--and I've heard them all--I will listen to Bob.  That's why, to me, the least successful versions were thosethat sounded most like his--Rainy Day Women (Kravitz) and You Ain't Goin' Nowhere (Dennen), anyone?  What's the point?  On the other hand, just being un-Bob does not ensure success (e.g., Deyhim).  I don't like rap but I thought one of the more original versions was K'naan (never heard of him) with God On Our Side.  Punked-up versions of songs is kind of a \\"Singing Covers 101\\" trick that often works and there are some good ones (Times They are A'Changin'; Desolation Row) but the trick tends to lose its charm when heard repeatedly.<br /><br />All in all, a nice collection.  Uneven, yes, but so has been Mr. Dylan's output.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|\\"Living Things\\" is great! This is another great album from Linkin Park. One of the best rock albums of the year, so far and of the summer season. All (12) tracks on here are great.<br /><br />Track Listing<br />1. Lost In The Echo (4 out of 4)<br />2. In My Remains (4 out of 4)<br />3. Burn It Down (4 out of 4)<br />4.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I could cut the rope all night long it was the first game I purchased as soon as I got my tablet. totally awesome and addicting! !!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|well I really love the game but I don't like that you have to wait and how long it takes you to get acorns.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game time consuming.  fun<br />can update to facebook. cool n fun it is free great so always a plus
B0086700CM|2.0|Like the game but it stutters too much!! I have a droid3 and the game is very slow. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still too slow!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game fun for the whole family, love that you can earn coin &amp; acorns to buy more animals.
B00786XVOG|5.0|I have a friend who was in Puerto Rico for this concert. He recommended me to buy the CD. I am not disappointed. Beautiful music and beautiful scenery.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|I feel like words completely fall short of describing Fiona and her music - most recently this album. I am obsessed with this album, and all Fiona fans must must own it.<br /><br />Every Single Night is so freaking good. UGH THE WHOLE THING IS AMAZING JUST BUY IT!<br /><br />:-)
B008B1VYP0|2.0|After about 3 songs, Overexposed has given you all it has to offer......or so it seems. It's completely hollow and generic, which is a damn shame, because I've enjoyed all of their previous work for being good pop music. This however steals from the worst pop music to come out in the past couple of years. Are they even a band? I don't hear actual drums, and there's hardly any guitar playing here. Overprocessed (and for Maroon 5 THAT'S saying something) and forgettable. Guess we can blame The Voice.
B00881VLCE|4.0|very good for passing a little time.  only problem i have is its upside down so i hold my gtablet that way to work puzzles.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well developed characters from diverse backgrounds attend a military order's seminary and go out for heroic feats.  Nothing morally clear cut..ambiguity rules....outcomes are not always obvious....had elements of Game of Thrones lite.
B000067FP8|5.0|The first movie never left much of an impression on me, but this one is just hilarious; even named one of my cats Gizmo in it's honor. It's just as funny seeing it as an adult as it was when I was a little girl. This is my idea of both a babysitting movie & a date night movie.<br /><br />You'll find that you just remember a lot of scenes from this movie, that you'll be humming the background music, 7 that the death of the talking brainy singing Magwai is almost as sad as there not being a 3ed movie.<br /><br />Well, I hadn't seen this in years & I found myself thinking \\"Hey, those Furby things were totally modeled after Magwai\\" & \\"This is what Pokemon would be like as a horror comedy.\\"<br /><br />Fans who prefer 2 over 1 should enjoy Jim Henson's Labyrinth, Child's Play: Bride of Chucky, & Child's Play: Seed of Chucky.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|It doesn't seem too long ago that I did like Ms Krall's singing plus her piano but unfortunately the flaws in her voice have become more apparent with each album---like her breathiness.  Also the voice which was once clear has become raspy and annoying to the point I can't listen to her.  If one wants to hear control and beauty in voice, do check out Jane Monheit who's miles ahead of Ms Krall in artistry and precision.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is really more of a \\"girl book\\" than a guy book, but I stuck with it anyway. Yes, there is plenty of rather graphic sex. What is a little oversold is the kinky sex. It's not as graphic, nor as kinky as I think they want you to believe.<br />The biggest problem I had with it is the repetitive nature of the writing. If Ana said that her skin or face \\"flushed\\" once, it flushed 50 times. Also, if she \\"fisted\\" his hair while they were in the throes of passion one time, she fisted it 20 times.<br /><br />And Christian was just too rich, talented, pretty and brainy to be remotely true. No one looks as good, plays the piano as well, flies multiple types of aircraft, knows as much about technology, yada yada yada as he does...especially at the age of 28. And where did all his money come from? If you believe the book (which provides precious little insight into those important facts) you would think that he knows how to run tech businesses, real estate, retail, security, etc etc etc. No one that age could pull all that off. The only way a 28 year old could have accumulated that much money is in the tech world. Period.<br /><br />Regardless, it's a unique story that kept my attention more than it deserved. The two main characters are well developed but not so easy to believe - especially Christian. But be prepared. After you read it, you may as well plan on getting the 2nd & 3rd books in the trilogy. You'll have too much of your brain invested in it.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|dis stinks!!!!!!! :(  da hams would prov b fun 2 7-12 year olds<br />trust me u don't want dis lam ___ game
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app sooooooooo much! it is so entertaning. and we finally have it for this kind of device
B0083EY9EI|5.0|This is the first new CD I brought in years, which said it all, music isn't how it used to be.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like it. Its entertaining and easy to use on my kindle. There seems to be a wide variety of pictures and several different sizes to choose from.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is one of the best games I have ever played!  it takes a few times to get use to it but after that it is amazing!
B007R12TNQ|4.0|Fun movie for the family.  If you liked the first movies you'll like this.  My kids watched it several times on our kindle fire and it ran great...easy enough for a 5 year old to run!
030758836X|4.0|This book was absolutely riveting right from the first word. I couldn't have predicted the ending if I'd tried! The intricate drawings of the characters, the roller coaster ride of theories and emotions; all was absolutely superbly done! Masterful work by Flynn- would highly recommend but only if you don't mind lots of foul language. Otherwise, awesome read!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well,  I think that this is a really good app. I must admit though,  it's hard!:) the only problem is that u have to unlock games. but I think that's better than having to buy it with ur own cash.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|First things first. I have been a Linkin Park fan for a long time. I had a extreme dislike for the last few albums.<br /><br />Something about this album was different. I listened to it alone with nothing else to bother me. I went from cover to cover which was easy to do because this is a short album.<br /><br />I went into this album with a completely different mindset than I had there 2 previous albums. I knew I wasnt going to get Hybrid Theory by hearing \\"Burn it Down\\" on the radio the last few months. I wasnt a huge fan of the song but I always listened to it. By the time the album came out something about \\"burn it down\\" was awesome. Did I finally \\"get it?\\" or what? I dont know but I liked it..... a lot.<br /><br />So CD comes out today and I popped it in for a listen and wasn't blown away but I liked it. So for my \\"Review\\" I just want to tell people to listen to this without any prior \\"I WANT HYBRID THEORY\\" mindset. If you do you will hate it. If you dont like burn it down do give this a listen. If you like Burn it down you will love it.<br /><br />Give it a go open minded and enjoy.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Wow! I've been a SwiftKey fan for a while but the update to SwiftKey 3 was the best update I've ever experienced on any app! The changes are obvious immediately; great job by SwiftKey! The punctuation shortcuts work so smoothly now. Its ability to guess my next word is right on! I barely need to type anymore! Highly recommended! There are new themes but I still like neon the best. More colorful themes would be fun... Like yellow for summer! I'm impressed!
0345803485|1.0|well, i haven't read this book and i don't intend to.<br />i'm only writing this because i've been trying to understand what is so special about this book anyway. i mean, ok it is a romance read, probably good for people who like this kind of stuff, ok with me. but again, why's the fuss?<br />i mean,i remember sometime when romantic tales of this type were considered to be bad literature. the story isn't special, it talks for a wealthy super male who has a problematic past and a sensitive,innocent and also troubled invisible-kind of girl. yeah it seems good if you'd like to read something light to kill your time. but why does everybody takes this so seriously? i mean, come on people! 3 books on a relationship that has no original plot? i just don't understand it. this book just seems what was once called a harlekin. what's so great about it anyway? what is it in this book that is said for the first time? why are you so impressed?<br /><br />i'd love it if someone who has read it could answer me and tell me why this book worths reading. i'm just so curious.
1593272200|5.0|A great book for the practitioner! Rather than merely describing the interfaces, the author presents just enough background to why things are without losing the reader in esoteric explanations. For those who would like to dig deeper, the book is full of useful references for further reading, but you will find that for day to day stuff everything is included. There are no wasted pages. This book \\"feels\\" like the classic \\"TCP/IP Illustrated\\" by Stevens, only it covers much more than networking. This is quite simply,  the most useful Linux programming book I have ever read.
0374275637|3.0|The 3 star rating is entirely based on my prism of what I expected from this book having seen and heard it advertised many times. First, the book is great. It is full of unexpected and clarified findings such as the way the different parts of our thinking systems react to problem solving, crises, etc. However, this is essentially a psychology textbook. Unlike many other popular reads it is dense and is of the greatest interest to the students and the researchers of psychology. Recommended with the caveats.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Loved it, true to form from the first movie. Hope a marriage and child comes. I will watch that one too! Suspenseful. Intriguing. From the beginning you had my attention as a child of the Great Wizard of Oz!  Loved the work here.  Bring on more but you have to step up the craft.  Don't use the same ol same old.  Stimulate and create what viewers have not seen yet.  Make another 8 to generate a series off of the \\"Order of the Phoenix.\\"  Re-begin here and create lives of all of the original characters with Harry as the lead Dumbledore of the future with Dumbledore visiting Harry and Harry's family in spirit and as a guide.  I have great ideas for more if you would creat a future from here.  Loved the whole HP.  Can't wait to get my hands on the HP DH2.  Hermoine could take over the future McGonagil with McGonagil as lead headmistress.  Hagrid, well gee, no one can do another Hagrid.  He is just so cool and can not be reproduced.  But Hagrid and GiAnt could relate with future children as supporting actors and actresses.  Just keep it coming - don't let the storyline end here.  We need good examples of creative energy in film.  No one will ever do it again like Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Dumbledore, McGonagil, Hagrid and all of the little creatures.  They are awesome.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I was warned about reading this book. And I did go back and forth for awhile before deciding it wasn't for me. Or I wasn't for it. That I wasn't that intrigued. Or that I didn't want to hate myself in the morning. Take your pick. You're familiar with the hype/trainwreck induced cycle of warring self-doubt and insatiable curiosity, yes? Then you understand. And I honestly didn't give it a second thought after making that decision. Then I read and loved [[ASIN:098566181X Easy]]. And I immediately started running across comparisons, mentions of similarities. Plus, several of these new-ish, self-published new adult authors have been all over the place lately, and, well, all that curiosity washed over me full force once more. So I decided I wanted to decide for myself. I think I went in expecting one big hot mess from start to finish, albeit a hot mess I couldn't look away from and would be compelled to see through to its inevitable overwrought ending. You see? I had been warned. But BEAUTIFUL DISASTER still managed to surprise me. In both good and bad ways.<br /><br />Abby is cardigans and pearls. She's straitlaced and together and interested in finding a dependable, going places boyfriend. Except she's totally not. Abby is dedicated to getting good grades and keeping all her ducks in a row. She's not at all interested in attending one her university's underground fight clubs just to see what it's like. Except she totally is. And that's how she meets the infamous Travis Maddox. His name alone inspires men to sit up straighter and glance over their shoulders. His rakish reputation precedes him, and it seems women fall at his feet as a matter of course. But when these two seeming opposites meet at one of Travis' fights, sparks fly as it were. And a friendship is born in lieu of a romance, as Abby is determined not to become another one of the hapless females Travis leaves in his wake, and for his part, Travis seems unable to look away from a girl who seems to like him well enough but clearly doesn't want him. While their respective friends are somewhat skeptical, somewhat intrigued by their burgeoning friendship, it's what they're hiding from each other--the combustibility of it all--that might cause this fragile new thing to go up in flames before they can figure out just what it is they're dealing with.<br /><br />I loved the first half. Loved it, I say. Right from this first encounter:<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"What the hell are you doing, Abby?\\" Shepley said.<br /><br />\\"I can't see from back there!\\" I called to him.<br /><br />I turned just in time to see Marek land a solid punch. Travis turned, and for a moment I thought he had dodged another blow, but he made a complete circle, crashing his elbow straight into the center of Marek's nose. Blood sprayed my face, and splattered down the front of my cardigan. Marek fell to the concrete floor with a thud, and for a brief moment the room was completely silent.<br /><br />Adam threw a scarlet square of fabric on Marek's limp body, and the mob detonated. Cash changed hands once again, and the expressions divided into the smug and the frustrated.<br /><br />I was pushed around with the movement of those coming and going. America called my name from somewhere in the back, but I was mesmerized by the trail of red from my chest to my waist.<br /><br />A pair of heavy black boots stepped in front of me, diverting my attention to the floor. My eyes traveled upward; jeans spattered with blood, a set of finely-chiseled abs, a bare, tattooed chest drenched in sweat, and finally a pair of warm, brown eyes. I was shoved from behind, and Travis caught me by the arm before I fell forward.<br /><br />\\"Hey! Back up off her!\\" Travis frowned, shoving anyone who came near me. His stern expression melted into a smile at the sight of my shirt, and then he dabbed my face with a towel. \\"Sorry about that, Pigeon.\\"<br /><br />Adam patted the back of Travis' head. \\"C'mon, Mad Dog! You have some dough waitin' on ya!\\"<br /><br />His eyes didn't stray from mine. \\"It's a damn shame about the sweater. It looks good on you.\\" In the next moment he was engulfed by fans, disappearing the way he came.<br /><br />***<br /><br />They were just too much fun. In fact, my favorite thing about Abby and Travis was their friendship. The motorcycle rides, the dancing, the doing homework together, the laughing. I mean, it was always headed for a conflagration relationship-wise, but the friendship was honestly just so much fun while it lasted. So for the first half of the book, this book and I were BFFs. The problem came at right about the halfway mark, at which point things got monumentally sketchy. The romantic tension was pretty high throughout. The good kind of high. So I was strangely underwhelmed (when the romance actually started going places) at how uninvolved Abby seemed to be when it came right down to it. The character depiction led me to believe Travis was utterly invested, but Abby never seemed to be on the same page. She said she was. But I never felt it. Which resulted in the whole thing feeling very one-sided just at the moment when it should be expanding and growing. It through me right out of the narrative, this empty gap in the arc of their relationship. I bought that he loved her, in as unhealthy a fashion as he did. But Abby's lack of response confused and disappointed me. And it really did feel like a flaw in characterization. Then right on the heels of this blip, the whole book goes right out to lunch. And it never recovers. The plot, the characters, the writing spin away into the void. All that fun, careful development (much more restrained than I was expecting) of the beginning disappeared in what felt like the space of a page.<br /><br />So I didn't hate myself in the morning. On the contrary, I actually mourned the characters in the morning. How's that for unexpected? The Travis and Abby of the first half were hard to let go. They were so full of life and danger and laughter and jagged edges that I loved them. I went through my day wanting to be around them. Unfortunately, they up and left on me. And the characters who took their place left me utterly cold. The what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, frothing at the mouth frantic, we suddenly haven't learned a thing from the past 200 pages shenanigans that littered the second half had me dropping my nook in my lap in bewildered exhaustion. To be led to care so much for half the book and then to wind up caring so little it didn't even register on the scale was quite the feat and an ignominious one at that. I don't regret my time with them. I just regret their premature loss. It was always a bit of freak show, but it could have pulled it out in the end instead of crashing and burning so spectacularly. Turns out violence and angst and absolute dysfunction for violence and angst and absolute dysfunction's sake just doesn't do it for me. And the thing is, the characters of the first half deserved better. I suppose I can't complain too much. After all, I was warned. So long Travis & Abby. You rocked. And then you really, really didn't.' on ya!\\"<br /><br />His eyes didn't stray from mine. \\"It's a damn shame about the sweater. It looks good on you.\\" In the next moment he was engulfed by fans, disappearing the way he came.<br /><br />***<br /><br />They were just too much fun. In fact, my favorite thing about Abby and Travis was their friendship. The motorcycle rides, the dancing, the doing homework together, the laughing. I mean, it was always headed for a conflagration relationship-wise, but the friendship was honestly just so much fun while it lasted. So for the first half of the book, this book and I were BFFs. The problem came at right about the halfway mark, at which point things got monumentally sketchy. The romantic tension was pretty high throughout. The good kind of high. So I was strangely underwhelmed (when the romance actually started going places) at how uninvolved Abby seemed to be when it came right down to it. The character depiction led me to believe Travis was utterly invested, but Abby never seemed to be on the same page. She said she was. But I never felt it. Which resulted in the whole thing feeling very one-sided just at the moment when it should be expanding and growing. It through me right out of the narrative, this empty gap in the arc of their relationship. I bought that he loved her, in as unhealthy a fashion as he did. But Abby's lack of response confused and disappointed me. And it really did feel like a flaw in characterization. Then right on the heels of this blip, the whole book goes right out to lunch. And it never recovers. The plot, the characters, the writing spin away into the void. All that fun, careful development (much more restrained than I was expecting) of the beginning disappeared in what felt like the space of a page.<br /><br />So I didn't hate myself in the morning. On the contrary, I actually mourned the characters in the morning. How's that for unexpected? The Travis and Abby of the first half were hard to let go.

B007FC3AAI|5.0|WOW!  Talk about twists... great trio.  Bring on the baby!  Create more to this.  This is so human and so out there.  Realistic relationships and nice portrayal of how love should behave.  I need to see more of this.  Disney had it right the first time.  The inheritors messed up Disney.  Take your opportunity and make good use of it with ethics, morals and values.  Betray these basics and you won't have a future.  As it stands, you have a wonderfully hopeful future ahead.  Great work from all the characters.  Do not let the fame go to your heads.  Stay focused and remember how you got there.  Hard work, determination, support from the home front and the lack of temptations that get you into trouble.  Stay focused people, America needs you.  Husband, go back to wife.  Wife go back to husband, hussy and hoser ... stay the heck out of these wonderful actors and actresses lives.  They are called to a greater purpose than you!
B00006JJ2Y|5.0|When Lou was Lou there was no one else. Lou knew what Lou knew that no one else knew. I was at Lou's feet during these Bottom Line concerts and it's all here: the venom, the rage, the poetry, the pain, the beauty, the pure unadulterated rocknroll animal twisting with all his humanity in a dance to the death. Take no prisoners, indeed. Lou set us free and saved our lives with rocknroll. \\"Oh, the glory of love...\\"
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Loved it, true to form from the first movie. Hope many more come. I will watch them too! Suspenseful. Intriguing.
B008578PMU|4.0|The FX are great, as are the action scenes. Does the script lack? Yes, but it is just a good, old fashioned, patriotic movie the likes of which they do not make anymore.
0307951529|5.0|This was a quick and easy read that offered up some really great advice and \\"how-to\\" examples. I'll be referring to this book as I work to build my own business.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This is such an amazing way to experience Bruce's work.  The handwritten journal, video of the recording of the music, the information contained in the documentary, the interviews and the amazing amount of additional material in the album 'The Promise' really make this an amazing experience.  I was lucky enough to receive this the day that it came out and I loved each and every aspect of this package.  The additional music was something that I listened to alot as well.
B004JRQ0UY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Great, hilarious performances by Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, and Toni Collette. BTW, no floppy hair in this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun!! love the movie and the game. my kids and I take turns playing. I suppose I play longer than them!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the app but it has to much adds and when I unlocked all the games the upgrade comes along and erased all my data. :(
B0042816YK|3.0|Eat, Pray, Love is a true story about a writer who leaves her husband because she's overcome with the feeling that her life doesn't fit and isn't a real reflection of herself. She seeks escape in a younger man, doesn't find it, then decides that she may have better luck by doing a yearlong adventure in Italy, India, and Indonesia. Through those adventures she finds love and happiness again.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the movie. I read the book and felt it was a self-indulgent pity party. I didn't expect much from the movie, but wanted to give it a chance.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Julia Roberts is horrible. I am not a Roberts fan, but seeing her in this was agony. I am so over her. She can't act. Period. She is the same in everything. Was this Erin Brockovich Goes to Italy or Julianne Porter (from My Best Friend's Wedding) Shacks Up? She looked depressed most of the time. When she lit up, it was a huge contrast, but that rarely happened. The only way I knew that she had transformed into a happy person was when the Balinese man (Ketut) said so.<br /><br />The pace was REALLY fast. I knew that there had to be a lot left out in order to cover adventures in three countries and give it a set up as well, but this was lightning speed. It didn't give a chance to really get the flavor of each location or how she was changed by the experiences there. We are just given dialog that tells us what happened. The segues from place to place were abrupt too.<br /><br />The ah ha! moments didn't translate to film. The first one was, \\"Go to bed, Liz.\\" That wasn't illuminating to me in the book either, but I could see how she thought it was. In the film, it was as if God was not listening to her. All of the big turning points in the book were lost in the movie.<br /><br />It's unrelatable. It feels like a fantasy. \\"Normal\\" people just don't cry over nothing, run off for a year, forget all their friends, and come back happy. I think that is the big message of the movie and that falls flat...unless that is your fantasy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Despite all I just said, I actually \\"got\\" that her inner/outer journey was transformative. Maybe that was because I read the book. Maybe it's because I lead sacred travel tours and have experienced that same growth myself. Some of the things that may have seemed trite and New Age resonated with me. (Maybe because I'm trite and New Age? lol)<br /><br />The scenery was the big winner. As a world traveler myself, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE seeing new places. The locations weren't just shot as background. They were characters in the movie! That was very effectively done. Of the three locations, I have only been to Rome, but it IS everything you see and more!<br /><br />I hate when people can't review a product for what it is instead of comparing it to the book because often, I haven't read the book. Sorry for doing that to you. If you haven't read the book and are wondering whether to try it out, my advice is, if you like Roberts, the Hollywood formula and exotic locales, you will probably like it. If you want meaning, logic and good acting, forget it. :)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I LOVE THIS APP!! I've always enjoyed puzzles, but haven't actually done one in years. now that I found this puzzle app, I don't want to play any of my other games on my Fire...just doing puzzles. this is actually more fun than boxed puzzles in that you don't have to worry about lost pieces, you can do them over &amp; over, and they don't take up an entire table for weeks or more. I also love the fact you can change this difficulty level with 5 different options...big, easy pieces to really small pieces &amp; even make it really challenging by allowing the pieces to rotate. I didn't rate this w/5 stars, however, because I would love to see one modification : when you begin a puzzle but have to leave it to finish another time, allow it to &quot;hold &quot; your place so that when you open the app back up to work on it again, you don't have to search for your puzzle &amp; piece size setting in order to find your unfinished puzzle. Other than that, its a really fun app!!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is really an awesome game. You really end up with a lot of junky apps and only find a good game like this every 20 or so you buy. I think it's well designed, and the sound effects are a little 80's retro, which i like. If you like golf, this is neat. My daughter plays this more often than angry birds, or other games like that.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I was skeptical of Linkin Park after their last two albums to be honest. I am unabashedly a diehard Hybrid Theory / Meteora fan and still listen to both albums all the time. To me minutes to midnight was ok, it was exceptional but it was easy to listen to. However with the release of A Thousand Suns I honestly thought Likin Park had completely lost their touch. It seemed like an odd mixture of electronic and pop, and just didn't feel like them. Living Things really impressed me and I am now fully back in my Linkin Park fan-mode. To me, the album seems like a mixture between Minutes to Midnight and Hybrid Theory. If that doesn't sound appealing enough, they add in many new sounds with the almost folksy Castle of Glass. This is one of the few albums where many genres seem to collide. From metal and hip-hop to alternative and rock, it has it all.
B003Y5H5BA|2.0|I'm not surprised you didn't get it.  It's a trick question.  There is no difference.<br /><br />I never saw the original series.  I was traveling with my son and couldn't find anything else to see at the theaters.  This was lame IMHO. The only fun part was the Johnny Deppy cameo at the end.
1439153663|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I loved the historical aspect, and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat to the point of exhaustion.
B002BY77CW|5.0|Fun book! Easy read! Couldn't wait to read the next one and Jumped right into Book 2 and that was fun and easy too!
B00597A6NU|5.0|Well done!  Script, acting, direction, cinematography, music, production...excellent! Kept my undivided attention. I didn't want it to end. A tad sappy here and there, but who cares! Worth your time.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|IVE NEVER LAUGHED AT ANYTHING SO HARD IN MY LIFE....IM A HUGE CHANNING TATUM FAN I OWN ALL HIS MOVIES BUT WHEN I STARTED WATCHING THIS AND I JUST GOT GLUED TO MY HUGE TV WITHING 2 MIN OF THE MOVIE STARTING.....THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING AND HILARIOUS AND GREAT STORY LINE AND CHANNING TATUM IS JUST PLAIN OUT FUNNY..I HOPE THEY MAKE A SEQUEL CAUSE I WILL GO SEE IT

B005LAIIS0|1.0|I used to like this actor. Not any more.  Weak story, lame acting, very weak storyline.  I kept waiting for something other than walking to happen and with the exception of the best part of the move, wolves, the movie sucked!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Well this game is challenging but not impossible. It's a game for young teens 7+ is probably the age range. The rating is good not great but good.
B004SBX112|4.0|this game is fun but some of the levels are too hard and it gets frusterating after a while but other than that its a good game
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love it! It has many great options to choose from. Great choice for a &quot;free app of the day.&quot;
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is the best angry bird out of all of them. it is completely worth the price and it has awesome graphics. the levels are just awesome
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the fast paced adventure and how you have goals, it not just some runandescape game..overall it was great..anyone hhave any idea when Temple run Brave is coming out in amazon?
B001JRB16U|4.0|For some reason, MARY POPPINS is a movie I have avoided through the years. I knew many of the songs and references to the film, but I never had a desire to see it. It seemed like it would be silly and cliche. Finally, I took the leap and began watching MARY POPPINS. For a while, I was sure I had been right through the years. Who cares about the Banks family and the cold and aloof Mr. Banks and the rather scattered Mrs. Banks? Because Julie Andrews literally lights up the screen as Mary Poppins, I kept watching. Her remarkable voice is a true gift and I could start putting songs I have heard into context.<br />Enter Dick Van Dyke as the seriously miscast Bert. His fake Cockney accent was irritating and I just could listen to his voice. The story chugs along in its silliness. Then something truly magical takes place. The story and the characters come together and in my opinion, it begins when they make an emergency visit to the \\"ailing\\" Uncle Albert played by the one and only Ed Wynn. Uncle Albert's illness? He loves to laugh and the more he laughs, the more weightless he becomes and he floats to the ceiling. His joyous laughter becomes infectious and soon Bert and the kids are floating with laughter much to the chargin of Mary Poppins. Here was the turning point and the rest of the film seemed delightful.<br />Walt Disney's mix of live action and animation was ahead of its time. He was always the innovator and I can only imagine how the eyes of young children lit up seeing this magical spectacle on the big screen in 1964. Long before computer animation, special effects were created by hand. Dick Van Dyke's dance with animated penguins is a charmer. It's Van Dyke's physical comedy that fills the screen. Forget his fake cockney accident, just relish with delight his long-legged rubbery figure as he cheefully makes his  way across the screen.<br />There could not have been another actress more perfect for the role of Mary Poppins as was Julie Andrews..lovely and young and beautiful, her songs are full of life and zest. No nonsense \\"practically perfect\\" Mary Poppins puts on a serious face but you know she loves the Banks children and her roll in bringing the family together. Stern Mr. Banks melts into joy with his children and Mary Poppins brings the family together.<br />We never know why Mary Poppins has magical powers. Even Bert seems to have magic in him. Mary flies over the streets of London with her open unbrella. She makes it all look effortless.<br />MARY POPPINS was off to a slow start with me and I went with the flow and was led into a delightful fantasy. Everyone needs a Mary Poppins in their life!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was a very complicated plot but kept on moving,and was difficult to put down! I'm not a word smith.
B0067QPVJ6|1.0|When I ordered this item (DVD of \\"The Thing\\" 2011), it was described as \\"New in shrink-wrap\\". When it arrived, I opened it to find that it was not new. It was a Rental. I noticed a few light scratches. I thought that if it played okay, I would let the fact that is wasn't New, slide. It played fine. I got to the \\"Bonus Features\\" to find that I could not access them because it was a Rental.<br /><br />That pissed me off. How can someone describe an item as \\"New\\", when it is clearly \\"Used\\"? I contacted the vendor via email through Amazon on Jun 17 2012, to resolve this issue, and have received no response.<br /><br />Amazon needs to screen these vendors a little more closely to make sure they are selling items as described. I will not use this vendor ever again and I am VERY UNSATISFIED.<br /><br />How does one resolve issues when the vendor does not reply to your request?<br /><br />If I could have rated this with zero stars, I would have. That's how pissed I am.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great price and fast delivery
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is another one of those great tunes for young girls to listen too.  My daughter and I love it and I don't have to tell her don't sing this at school because you'll get in trouble for nasty lyrics.
B007HJ91HU|4.0|This was fun. Of course it was predictable, but the remake is as good as the original but with sexier stars and more contemporary music.  Fun for everyone and worth watching.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|It has been nice to convert some cassettes to cd but the process is time consuming and if not done exactly done right you can lose your uploaded data and have to up the info again.  I also found the directions hard to read.  I think I have done 5 or 6 out of the 100s of cassette I have.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I originally used the Fiio E5 portable amp.. of which I was very unsatisfied with...<br />I'm using the E11 with Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro-80 headphones on my iPad. The difference with and without the amp is pretty big. And MUCH MUCH better than the E5.<br />Definitely recommend it.<br />I also tested the amp with my Sennheiser HD 650 headphones (300ohms). The amp has no problem driving 300ohm headphones.<br />The sound quality brought a big smile to my face. I can finally enjoy all my favorite headphones, on the go, with just my iPad and E11.<br />Though I will likely stick with the closed DT770s as the HD650s are open and let everyone else hear what you are listening to.<br /><br />Still... very impressed.<br /><br />I recommend getting the direct line-out cable for the iPad, iPod, iPhone.. if you plan to use with those devices.<br />I also ordered the  Micca Accessory Pack for FiiO E11 (E11-MAP) = $9.95 from the Micca website.<br />It comes with a spare battery and wall charger.
B000002IO1|5.0|This is another on of those great bring back memories cds.  When your cassette will no longer play it's nice to find a cd in mint condition.
1577311523|5.0|Incredible book, based on ancient wisdom, written in a way that is so accessible and relate-able today.  This book has helped me cope with anxiety and depression, boosted my confidence with women, even made me better at the keyboard.  Definitely recommended.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is a lot cooler than minecraft. it has better graphics, its cheaper and has more potential. true there are still some glitches but it is run overall. the only thing I can say is good game, horrible controls.
1609611543|5.0|I've read it once, am reading twice and will read it a third time...it is imperative the American population especially, reads and understands this life saving message...I wish this book had come along 30 years ago, I would be so much heathier, happier and no doubt would live a couple decades longer.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|The first thing to consider when watching this film is that it is Ghost Rider, you are not going to get Citizen Kane. The main point to this is really cool eye candy and wild special effects. This is delivered, but unfortunately the benefits are drowned out in the mess that made up the editing.<br />The premise was clever, and they made the Ghost Rider a darker figure than before. This built expectation as the film progressed but it failed to deliver.<br />The build up to the reveal was too long. Even if you feel you take take anticipaton the prolonged event of transformation went on far too long and began to deflate the tension they were hoping to build. The scene of Nicolas Cage combating his terror of what he is while mounted on the bike riding off out of control as well went on far to long. They established what was happening, we get it, yet it continues, and continues, and continues. It nearly becomes an insult.<br />As mentioned in other reviews, the animation sequence seemed to be taken straight out of Harry Potter. I initially thought, \\"So what, maybe they just like the way it looked\\". The problem was that it was placed disjointedly, feeling as if it really didn't belong and one of the many producers insisted that they needed something like that and the director put it in just to shut him up.<br />If you are going to watch this, rent it. If you're going to purchase it wait until it hits the eight to nine dollar range. Any more cash will spell regret.
B000000WHX|5.0|this is one of the coolest albuns ever!!!!It´s a great mix of jazz, eletronics, hip hop and reggae...All the songs are incredibly smooth, with great vocals and a nice instrumental...REALLY GREAT!!!!

0670022950|5.0|This is a long 700 page content-dense book.  Pinker's thesis is that human violence towards one another has declined and declined dramatically.  He doesn't at all dismiss the violence that continues in the present and he certainly does not deserve some of the dismissals given him in some of these reviews and comments.  You simply cannot dismiss a 700 page argument that is this well done with a few sentences or paragraphs, whether you agree with his conclusions or not.<br /><br />I happen to think he has argued very persuasively for his thesis and his speculations on why this has happened are certainly plausible.  Pinker backs up his arguments with extensive references to scholarly works.  This stuff just didn't pop out of Pinker's head in some kind of delusion as some would have you believe.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary achievement even if you don't agree with him.  You have to respect the effort, the method, and the attempt at an explanation.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B0086700CM|3.0|its very touchy, also mine is very lagy at times, still a fun game though and I enjoy it fix the lag and ill be happy :)

B0086700CM|3.0|this game is very very fun although its very hard to control and its got great graphics. I would rate this game a 5 star but its so hard to control
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Works well on my Kindle Fire. Hours of fun for the kids and me. Reminds me of I-Spy apps. Find the hidden objects with some puzzles thrown in. I'd recommend it.
B007XF0X6G|1.0|Warning! I bought the combo pack. The DVD has a copy-protection called \\"Cinavia\\" which renders it unplayable on my Sony Blu-Ray player. Thus, buying the DVD of this or any movie with \\"Cinavia\\" is a waste of money. I can play the DVD on another, older DVD player, but apparently some Blu-Ray machines, plus PS3 machines will not play these Cinavia movies. There is no way to know if your Blu-Ray player will play a Cinavia-protected movie until you shell out your money, open it up and try to play it. At that time, no store will refund your money as the package has been opened. Be careful and do a search for movies with Cinavia and avoid them like the plague---else you will be wasting your money to this scam.
0545265355|4.0|First two novels are a great read. The last in the series seemed to be lacking what made its predecessors excellent.
