B0001NBMBC|1.0|This CD makes me laugh. This is some of the worst music i've ever heard. When I heard Duality, I was sure that this CD would fail. Let's see how much this CD sucks:<br /><br />Lyrics: Generic \\"I hate my mommy\\" garbage.<br />Vocals: I've heard dying cats sing better.<br />Guitars: Power chord heaven, with 1 half-assed, out of place solo in 1 song to cover up the lack of talent<br />Bass: I wasn't aware of any bass whatsoever<br />Drums: OVERRATED<br />DJ: DJ!? Don't make me laugh!<br />Samples: Stupid pinhead. Jordan Rudess of Dream Theater could kill this guy.<br />Percussion: Their idea of percussion is 2 guys smashing things with baseball bats.<br /><br />Stupid CD from a dumbass band. Slayer & Dream Theater could kill these guys.<br /><br />To the guy who said he's making me think twice, not really. Slipknot is still false metal.
0441172717|5.0|I'd read Dune three times before writing this review.  The very fact that I still find Frank Herbert's complex plots and political intrigues a new experience every time is a testament to his masterful writing.   Written in 1965, Dune marks the revival of the world-building genre of Sci-Fi/Fantasy that can't been so poetically written and artfully compiled by anyone, with the remotely possible exception of J.R.R. Tolkein..  The creation of complicated systems of Feudal Imperialism and intergalactic geography could be done by none other than Herbert himself. <br />As we join the young Paul Atreides, the heir to the family sovereignty, he is about to take a journey to Arrakis.  It is apparent early on that Arrakis controls a monopoly on the production of the universe's most necessary food item, the spice.  The spice is a geriatric substance which allows for widespread space-travel and gives a specially trained group super-human powers. Arrakis was a rich gift left by the Atreides' arch enemy, the Harkonnen family.  However, the reader knows early on that this acquisition is a trap.  As Paul and his father starts to suspect the treachery, the complex web of conspiracies and double-crosses from every major political player soon paints a gigantic masterpiece of political intrigue and lies.  The Harkonnen, with help from the elite imperial troops, invade Arrakis with overwhelming force.  Also the Baron Harkonnen blackmails the Atreides' family doctor into lowering the force-shields of Arakeen, the planet's major city.  The doctor himself, however, has a plot to kill the baron of the Harkonnen family.  He allows Paul and his mother to escape and gives Paul's father a tooth filled with poison to kill the Harkonnen leader. <br />After reading the first hundred pages, even the most astute reader must backtrack in order to follow the complex plots and sub-plots.  This frustrating process is a testament to Herbert's genius in creating a symphony of conspiracy which ends with a major unraveling in the last ten pages.  Paul goes into the desert and consumes massive amounts of spice to become a man of messianic proportions.  This gives him the right to proclaim himself the savior to the local people.  He regains Arrakis from his enemies and blackmails the emperor with the threat of revealing his hand in the treachery. In addition, he threatens to ruin the production of spice by killing the sand worms, the animals which make the spice, an event which would cripple the intergalactic economy.  Though, at first, I wondered how the author would (or could) bring so many interwoven chains of events to a conclusion, the interest and conflicts only became more heated until the breaking-point at around the 300th page:  The author then concluded the epic and left room open for the other five books he would go on to write.  This is surely an excellent example of plot-heavy literature and will always be remembered as the masterpiece of science fiction literature.  I personally recommend that every fan of science fiction literature read this book. <br />

B000EHQ88C|4.0|Originally published at the end of the Eighties, SPIN Selling details a questioning technique that prompts prospects to identify and explore the severity of business problems, and then understand how your solution would resolve their issues.<br /><br />In contrast to the aggressive and combatitive approaches before it, SPIN Selling turned the sales call into a constructive experience for the prospect and greatly lowered the number of objections received by sales people. It was so effective that it became widely recognised as the Grandfather of all modern sales techniques.<br /><br />This book can genuinely claim to be a classic sales text, though it is fair to say that newer methodologies, based on SPIN, have been developed that augment and extend the core of the SPIN model. For example, some newer methodologies offer an end-to-end guide to selling (e.g. how to generate and manage opportunities, understanding the prospect company structure, precall planning, predicting successful close probability, etc), all of which are extremely useful, but absent in \\"SPIN Selling\\". Furthermore, the business environment has change significantly since the publication of this book and therefore, some of the techniques suggested in this title require \\"tweaking\\" in order to be useful today.<br /><br />If you are already familiar with consultative/solution selling techniques, then you will find little helpful content in \\"SPIN Selling\\" (as what you have already read/been trained in, will probably have stemmed from SPIN in the first place!) If you do not currently employ a question-based, problem solving approach to selling, then this book will unquestionably up your sales. However, a title like \\"New Solution Selling\\" (by Keith M Eades) would provide you with a similar approach that is better suited to the temperament of today's buyers, plus you would benefit significantly from a more complete methodology to guide your sales activities.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|OK, so this is not a masterpiece, but this is not nearly as bad as I would have expected given the horrid reviews by both critics and moviegoers when it first came out.  The real question, I believe, is not why people think this is so good, but why anyone imagines that the graphic novel and the MTV animated series based upon it were so great.  In all three cases the basic story had plot holes you could drive an armada of eighteen-wheelers through, all three were based vastly more on style than substance, and all three were more about how it parsed visually rather than logically.  No version of Aeon Flux could be honestly considered any kind of classic and I really can't privilege either of the previous versions over this one.<br /><br />Once one gets past the fact that this doesn't have the tightest plot in the history of cinema and just concentrates on the visuals that was really all the previous two versions had going for it, this is actually a fairly pleasant film.  Yeah, there were moments when I would flinch at the silliness of things, but, again, the same silliness afflicted the novel and animated series.<br /><br />If there is a chameleon in the movies today, it is Charlize Theron.  I find it nothing should of stunning the various physical types that she can play and I think she did a more than creditable job in this one.  Her presence here is remarkable of only because she truly is a first rate actress, capable of a wide variety of roles.  She can do action films, dramas, Sci-fi, and comedy, and could probably do other kinds of films as well if called upon to do so.  She looks good as Aeon, nothing like the previous two versions, but then Aeon in those incarnations looked, in my opinion, rather ridiculous.  Since no actresses who are 6'2 and have measurements of 32-16-30 were available, one has to settle for someone like the lovely Ms. Theron.  The greatest testament to her abilities comes from the fact that in the same period of time this film came out, NORTH COUNTRY was released for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and she appeared in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT in an extraordinary role for which she could very well be nominated and win an Emmy (you heard it here first) as the \\"special\\" British female Rita.  As many will know, Theron, who is a very good athlete, did as many of her stunts as possible.<br /><br />I thought the basic story, as long as one doesn't try to poke too many holes in the plot (an easy thing to do), was fun.  I put no spoiler warnings here so I won't go into the plot, but the basic premise has a kind of Philip K. Dick quality twist on things, where reality isn't as real as it seems.  Nonetheless it is impossible to completely ignore the essential silliness of so many things in the novel/series/movie.  The superfluous athleticism is only one of these.  Why the endless back flips, not only when they are nonfunctional but when they would be actual distractions?  For instance, when Aeon jumps to grab one of the things dangling from the ship that hovers the city she does a full somersault on her way down.  How in the world could that help things?  And why do fifty feet of somersaults instead of simply sprinting?  A one legged person could out hop someone doing back flips or somersaulting.  You can contrast this with the action sequences in another fairly recent film, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.  What makes Matt Damon's action sequences so refreshing is that in every instance he does the absolute minimum number of moves to be effective.  It makes Bourne come across as the effective killing machine that he is supposed to be.  Here, as in the novel and series, Aeon comes across as an extravagant wind up toy.  And one of my pet peeves:  breaking necks.  I took quite a bit of martial arts and in grappling classes actually was trained in the ways that one can break a neck, mainly so that you can be on the defensive of it happening to you.  On a host of shows and in movies there has developed an intensely dumb way of doing this, which apparently consists of pushing the chin off to one side.  Trust me, you can't break a neck this way.  (My beloved series BUFFY and ANGEL were two of the worse at perpetuating this method of neck breaking.)  OK, this is nitpicking, but I state it as an example of the way the film starts falling apart if you pick at it.  But, again, the same was true of the novel and series.  It's not like the silliness suddenly started with the movie.<br /><br />So, I recommend this, especially to fans of Sci-fi, as long as you don't expect a tautly thought out story.  What you get is a host of gorgeous images, a compelling main character portrayed by the lovely Charlize Theron, and a pretty interesting visual representation of the future.  I've seen worse and I've definitely seen better but I think a tolerant fan will find more than a little to enjoy in it.has developed an intensely dumb way of doing this, which apparently consists of pushing the chin off to one side.

0716703440|5.0|Gravitation gives a wonderful presentation of general relativity and the mathematics, primarily differential geometry, needed to understand it. Virtually every topic in classical general relativity is well covered. This book has so much to offer it's only possible to give a subjective view of the highlights and things that make the book unique. <br /> <br />It has a very good introduction to special relativity. This not only helps the reader understand special relativity, but it also gives practice with some of the mathematics needed for general relativity. I don't think many (any?) advanced general relativity books cover special relativity this thoroughly. One thing of special note is that there is a chapter devoted to special relativity and accelerated observers. The reason I think this is important is that it's a fairly common misconception that general relativity is needed to deal with acceleration, I wish more books had chapters like this. <br /> <br />The use of electromagnetism to illustrate the use of tensors is fairly extensive. This not only helps readers learn tensor analysis, but will also help them understand electromagnetism better. <br /> <br />Although black holes are covered in virtually every book on general relativity, the discussion here is much more thorough than usual. The material on the dynamics of the Schwarzschild solution is not a perspective most books give. In addition there is very nice coverage of stellar structure. <br /> <br />The exercises are great. <br /> <br />There is a lot of material on experimental general relativity. <br /> <br />The historical anecdotes are interesting. <br /> <br />There are an above average number of illuminating diagrams <br /> <br />The chapter on the Bianchi identities is exceptional, it also hints to the study of homology. <br /> <br />The initial-value problem is also exceptional. <br /> <br />Regge calculus is covered, an important topic in numerical relativity that is usually neglected. <br /> <br/>The chapter on superspace is quite interesting. No, superspace in this sense doesn't have anything to do with supersymmetry. It's the space of solutions to general relativity, among other things this is important for quantum cosmology. <br /> <br />Pretty much any topic in general relativity one would be interested in has excellent coverage, with the possible exception of quantum gravity which only has a small amount of material. <br /> <br />The downsides? While I appreciate the coordinate fee notation, it's not that easy to use when working the exercises. I prefer the use of abstract index notation, at least for working problems with a pen and paper. Some of the diagrams early in the book might be a little confusing to readers without prior knowledge of differential geometry. This isn't really a downside, but this is a fairly advanced book and it might not be an ideal first book on general relativity (Schutz's book provides an excellent introduction and has a similar approach to this book). <br /> <br />In short, this is an exceptional book. Anybody with serious interest in learning general relativity would do well to study it.
B00028HBKC|3.0|I have mixed views of this movie. Let me explain. <br /> <br />* It's extremely violent -- It's very disturbing how many times Jesus is hit in the court yard. <br />* Mel Gibson is extremely good at directing films. The cinematography is excellent. The way the Jewish Sanhedrin is dressed, the way Caiaphas shouts. The fact it's done in Aramaic and Latin all the way through adds to the realism. <br />* The music fits the scenes very well. <br />* I love the first bit where it's dark and they are outside -- beautiful scenery! <br />*IT HAS SUBTITLES ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT! -- IF YOU DON'T LIKE SUBTITLES, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM. But it's a shame, because it makes it so much more realistic! <br /> <br />Jesus (they say Yeshua 'Mesheeiah' in the film) has flash backs throughout the film. On the mountain telling everybody to have love amongst themselves, the Passover, the woman caught in adultery (disputed part of the Bible) and playing around with the woman at the well. <br /> <br />Despite it's inaccuracies towards history, the basic settings, feelings and attitudes betrayed through this movie is very accurate and it's like as if you are witnessing Jesus' last few hours before his painful and agonizing crucifixion. <br /> <br />All Christians when just finishing watching this film would feel happy they are Christians. Any Christian, or Christian sect: Catholic, Anglican, Born Again, Greek Orthodox, 7th Day, Mormon or a Jehovah's Witness would love this film -- even though they would not admit what religious organization they'd come from! <br /> <br />I love the way center on the role of Jesus as the Christ and his absolute love of God which he consistently calls \\"father\\" all throughout the film. Jesus is shown in the film as loving, kind, compassionate but also having a human side to his nature to him, which is exactly how he is betrayed in the Gospels, which is opposite to the movie \\"The Ten Commandments\\" mini-series (not to be mistaken for the 1950's classic by the samename!) which shows Moses from a human perspective far too much. The Passion was quite disturbing, but morally up building which is opposite to the 10 commandments miniseries -- I wasn't convinced by the acting, or the sets... <br /> <br />The people in The Passion look Jewish, act Jewish and speak ancient languages. I could have imagined Pontius Pilate to be like that -- a typical European stature, bald head and with good reasoning ability. <br /> <br />Strangely enough, I have a new way at looking at Judas -- the way he threw the money at Caiaphas showed how upset he was, and who knows if he will be resurrected. The whole experience was an extremely turbulent time. I felt sad for Peter who denied Jesus 3 times... <br /> <br />WARNING: SPOILER!!! I don't often give away spoilers, but because this is a religious movie title, I thought I'd give my opinion on the fact the tail end of the movie was a bit short, and should have shown the \\"doubting Thomas\\" not believing that it really was Jesus unless he sees the print of the nails. <br /> <br />I heard some weird rumor about the fact the divine name is used, which is complete nonsense. It would have been good if they did say \\"Yahweh/Jehovah,\\" or even Iabe... but it doesn't really matter because I realize it was done by a Catholic. Maybe they said YHWH, but probably missed it because I did watch the movie very late at night. But all for the better! <br /> <br />I almost would want to go to church after seeing this movie and be Catholic myself! The connection between the Roman rule of Jerusalem and approximately 300 years when the Catholic faith historically started, the Christian religion would later become the state religion of the Roman empire. Thank God Constantine god rid of the crucifix when he became Christian! <br />I don't know why Mel added the inaccuracies: like speaking Latin the the Jewish Sanhedrin crowds, the evil man on the cross having his eyes poked out by a bird, Satan as a woman (!) and so forth. But these weird \\"apocryphal\\" things don't spoil the passion for Jesus Christ. <br /> <br />Great movie. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED: It's extremely violent and perhaps Jesus was beaten too much? Although, he was a perfect man, it would have taken a while to beat him nearly half to death as what happened to him in this movie. This movie was written by a man who has such a passion for Jesus, and is perhaps more symbolic in some places rather than historical and maybe he wanted to do this so we have more feelings for our king Jesus before he hands over his throne to the Father after the 1000 years. I hope Mel makes more films like this. How about a movie about The Acts of the Apostles, or A Revelation to John from the New Testament and use the book of Jude as an intro and having a flashback where Jesus is arguing with the devil over Moses' body. I am looking forward to his next film: Apocalypto, which is going to be released later 2006 about the Mayans before Columbus and their declining civilization. Great director! That movie has subtitles all the way through it too!

B000E6UK5K|1.0|Who would win the contest of \\"Most embarrassing rock-star wife?      Our contestants will be Yoko Ono, Linda McCartney, and Polly Samson?    Linda McCartney certainly had no real talent but she did obtain a partial songwriting credit for the song \\"Live and Let Die\\" which is a great song.  She also obtained partial credits for the songs from \\"Ram\\" which is a very nice album.  She sang some back-up vocals and did a semi-decent job.  Most importantly, she backed off when Paul McCartney decided to get serious and give us Band On The Run.      Yoko Ono was already known for her avantegarde art prior to meeting John Lennon.  Also, she has the nerve to grunt and scream on her records so which we give her partial credit for that.  Also, she allowed John Lennon, who is the second greatest lyricist of all time (next to Roger Waters), to write his own songs without getting in his way.  We give her credit for that as well.    Polly Samson was reportedly a \\"short story writer\\" before she met David Gilmour.  However, since nobody has every heard let alone actually seen or read any of her works, we can safely assume that she is a writer the same way my college room-mate was writer...in other words, it is what you tell people when you don't want to say \\"I am a hostess for Denny's\\".   Also, Polly's lyrics and music are even worse than Linda's or Yoko's...a difficult feat.  No Live and Let Die from Polly, no Ram, no previous notoriety for her crazy art.  .     Therefore, the trophy for most embarrassing and least talented rock-star wife goes to Polly Samson!!!  Congratulations Polly!!   For you prize, you win 100,000 unused copies of the most boring album in history.... On An Island.    Enjoy!!!! (nobody else does)        How many members of Pink Floyd does it take to screw in a light-bulb?    All four.  But Rick will refuse to help, Nick will just get in the way, Roger will do the entire thing by himself, and David will whine that Roger gets too much credit and get his embarrassingwife to screw in the next lightbulb.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I'm listening to the David Gilmour's new \\"On an Island\\" CD as I type this (and enjoying an amazingly nice amber ale...amazing because I got it from a microbrewery in France of all places), and first off, I have to say it's nice (the ale too).  Not fabulous.  Not earthshaking.  Not \\"blows my socks off\\".  But nice.  Looking through the reviews here, there seem to be contributions from believers, former believers, non-believers, and even the newly converted to the Church of Floyd.  And where do I sit on that graphed-out spectrum of faith?  Hmmm... let's just say I usually like the delivery of the sermon though I might not always buy the message.  I DO like Gilmour's guitar playing a lot, and I've always liked his vox as well.  And if I had to rank order the top 5 things I like about Floyd, what Gilmour adds to PF would be in at least 3 of the 5 positions.<br /><br />So where does this CD sit in ranking of Gilmour or Gilmour-co-created work?  Nicely in the top half I would say.  I own Gilmour's entire solo catalogue (all 3 of them now...5 if you count the last 2 PF studio releases--just kidding), and about half of the PF catalogue.  For comparisons, this CD surprisingly took me further back than I thought it would.  The overall feel is VERY relaxed (almost sleepy in places).  More like \\"Meddle\\" and parts of his first solo disc than \\"About Face\\" or \\"Division Bell\\".  Gilmour definitely comes across like he's doing exactly what he wants to do on this disc.  No pressure to prove himself, replicate massive success, or whatever.  Where \\"Meddle\\" was fairly relaxed with that \\"I'm too stoned to care\\" feeling, this coaxes out an \\"I'm too old to care\\" mood, and for me that's cool.  The CD appears to have been inspired by some relaxing time in the Greek isles, and having spent time in the Greek isles (perks of a nice job a decade ago), I can tell you he very much captured the VERY low-stress groove of Greek island life.<br /><br />The guitar work is typical Gilmour (meaning the tone and phrasing are quite tasty), and as a pleasant surprise, Dave can also kick out some sweet bluesy licks on the sax.  A polish friend of mine was quick to point out the orchestral arrangement/conducting work on this CD coming from Zbigniew Preisner, and the added orchestra does sit almost transparently in the background, enhancing the feel of the CD but not necessarily defining it.  The lyrics aren't great, but they're not bad (as good as or better than most Neil-Morse-penned lyrics). And yes, the vocals are kind of airy and everything is in this mellow tempo, but all that just helps sell the sedated feel to the whole CD.  If you like the more easy-listening stuff from Gilmour's work, you'll like this.  And yes, it sounds a lot like Floyd, which is natural as Dave was a key part of shaping the PF sound.<br /><br />So, for a bit of redundant summary, if you tend to like the mellow parts of Floyd or Gilmour's work, you'll likely like this as well...tone and phrasing are quite tasty), and as a pleasant surprise, Dave can also kick out some sweet bluesy licks on the sax.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I've always been interested in the Final Fantasy-verses, though I'm not a PS2/X-Box gamer.  However, thanks to the internet, I know a relatively decent portion of the FF7 story and was very excited to get my hands on an early subtitled copy of Advent Children about five months ago.  The animation is breathtaking.  Gorgeous, amazing, jaw-dropping.  It is a complete departure from the blocky FF7 graphics of the game.  The voice-acting by the Japanese cast is great, and instills these already beloved characters with even more personality and vibrancy.  I ended up loving them all by the end of the film, despite knowing little to nothing about half of them - especially Reno & Rude.    As a non-gamer I had no trouble following along with the story and characters.  The story was interesting, but the characters stole the show.  What with the hype over this film, as well as the spin-off games in the works, I can only hope to see a sequel in the future.
0679735259|4.0|What a book!!!  Most of the previous reviewers are right--both the ones who loved it and the ones who hated it.  Yes, it is sort of a 260 page run on sentence.  And sometimes it feels like it was written on a bad acid trip.  And certainly, one can believe that the author was co-author of the screenplay for \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"  In fact, I would bet his primary contribution was the last part of the movie where everything goes totally crazy. <br /> <br />Having said that, \\"Dispatches\\" is a gripping and painfully graphic description of the fighting man's war in Vietnam.  Upon finishing this book, the reader almost feels like he/she has just been through the war.  Yet for all the blood, gore and insanity he descibes so well, the author also shows how many combatants (and war correspondents) find the glamour that exists within such horrid circumstances. <br /> <br />This book is not for the faint of heart!!
0156012197|5.0|What hasn't already been said about this charming book, The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince). Although it's a children's fable, it could easily be relatable to people of any age. What makes The Little Prince quite charming for children is how it takes you into a chimerical, imaginative, and creative world that's similar to the fables they're used to reading (such as Aesop's), and for adults, how it reminds us how simple and magical the world used to be when we were young. As an adult, I felt like a child all over again from reading this book. Back in those days, I used to raise flowers and snails since I was an only child and couldn't have pets inside of the house. Of course, I was considered strange for caring so much about these things that are the most ignored and pointless to most people. Seeing the Little PRince's relationship with his rose and the fox reminded me of my own experience with nature. This book has other philosophical dimensions as well, but at best I feel that this is a story that still, despite its depth, be looked upon through the eyes of a child, even if you're 18, 30, or 60.

B000056H24|5.0|<br />With his THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD (1965, UA), producer/director George Stevens set out to create a simple, straight-forward life of Jesus Christ that would stand the test of time as the definitive Biblical epic.  He worked on the screenplay with James Lee Barrett and Carl Sandburg.  He recruited a great all-star cast, some in major roles and some cameos.  And he scouted locations all over the American Southwest, finally settling on locations in Nevada, California's Death Valley, and Arizona's Monument Valley.  To him these rugged mountains and valleys seemed closer to the Holy Land of Christ  than Israel-or Morocco or Tunisia or Spain-did in the early 1960's. <br /> <br />Forty years later, in a gorgeous new 65mm Ultra Panavision, 6-track stereo roadshow print running 195 minutes, THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD remains my favorite Easter movie about the life and teachings of Christ (Max von Sydow in the performance of a lifetime).  Yes, it's a \\"spot the stars\\" movie with a terribly wooden John Wayne in one scene, but so is Franco Zeffirelli's acclaimed 1977 TV miniseries.  Half of Stevens' cast is relatively unknown to me.  I have never found Carroll Baker nor Angela Lansbury.  Many of the others are superb cameos, like Ed Wynn, Sal Mineo, Sidney Poitier, Dorothy McGuire, and Joseph Schildkraut.  Only a few have big roles, and these are almost all excellent, especially Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate and Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas. <br /> <br />The film is uncommonly intelligent and faithful to my life of Jesus, starting with his birth in Bethlehem, baptism in the River Jordan, early teachings, then the spectacular Sermon on the Mount in Monument Valley.  By contrast, the Nicholas Ray/Jeffrey Hunter KING OF KINGS (1961) has a brilliant Sermon on the Mount on a hillside in Spain, but gives a prominent role to a fictional Roman general named Lucius and a key role to Harry Guardino as Barabbas.  This detracts for me.  Barabbas should be a cameo.  As for Zeffirelli's impressive production, it is magnificently made, but too long and detailed.  Do we really need to spend an hour getting Jesus born, then another half hour getting him to adulthood in a production where I cannot find a Sermon on the Mount?  And the charge of a \\"Hey there\\" cast in Stevens' film goes triple for Zeffirelli over six-and-a-half hours.  Then we have Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004) with Roman beating scenes so bloody that I had to literally take a prescription tranquilizer to keep from fainting; and it only gives us the last day-and, like Scorsese's generally first-rate labor of love LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST (1988)-does not have much of a Resurrection. <br />   <br />Stevens, working in mammothly wide Ultra Panavision 70 (2.76:1 on DVD), creates some of the most impressive and beautiful Biblical compositions ever filmed.  And the Academy must have agreed.  GREATEST STORY  won five Oscar nominations, and three were for Cinematography, Art Direction, and Costumes.  The unforgettable Crucifixion is lit like a Goya painting, all blues and purples and mud browns.  This is the definitive Crucifixion-and the greatest, most exhilarating Resurrection sequence ever right after it:  the Mormon Taberacle Choir performing Handel's \\"Messiah\\" over color-tinted desert montage. <br /> <br />This 1965 life of Christ deserves way better than Leonard Maltin's mediocre ** ? (out of ****) rating.  It is a definitive, painstakingly crafted masterpiece for me that illuminates the life of Jesus, especially when watched at Easter or Christmas time and in one marathon 195 minute letterboxed DVD or Turner Classics screening without commercials.  Everyone connected with it, on both sides of the camera, can be very proud of their work. THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD is a movie for the ages. <br /> <br />The double DVD I am reviewing includes a brand-new 30 minute filmmaking documentary, a vintage short documentary, roadshow music and intermission, a photo gallery,and the original theatrical trailer. <br />
0765315246|4.0|It has been a while since I read something truely interesting. OLD MAN'S WAR fits the bill. This book is a recipe of sorts -- a little bit of STARSHIP TROOPERS, a bunch of ugly aliens with bad tempers, some modern science and green soldiers. <br /> <br />The basic idea is the Colonial Defence Forces need bodies, but they don't want just anyone. They're looking for the old, the haggard, the somewhat infirmed. That's right you can't sign up until you're 75. Then it is off the vast reaches of the universe to squash bugs or get killed in some very vicious ways. <br /> <br />The best recommendation I can make is that I am working my way through the sequel right now.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is my favorite Priest CD.  I think it may be their best.  It's so freakin heavy.  It's total metal.  Every song bashes your teeth in.  Their old stuff was good, but this is better.
B000002J03|5.0|Well what can anyone say about Led Zeppelin? its the toughest thing anyone can possibly be made to answer. Maybe it's wise to start with the other great human endeavours, the Ancient Greeks, the Pyramids, The European Rennaisance, Beethoven, Einstein. Put these in a melting pot and the end result would stll be vastly inferior to teh worst song by Led Zepplin. In fact it's wrong to think of Zeppelin as having a worst song. How dare I. HOW DARE I. Every single song Zeplin wrote is the utter peak of human GENIOS. The human mind is simply unable to comprehend the dizzying magnitude of Led Zeppelins genios. It cant be done. Its like trying to comprehend the vastness of the Cosmos. Every single man woman and child on the planet must do 60 years of penance for failing to be in the same league as Led Zeplin. Led Zeppelin is far far FAR and away the greatest thing to have EVER happened in history. We are but sinful WORMS in the Almighty prescence of Led Zeppelin. ANYONE WHO DOESN'T BOW DOWN BEFORE ZEPPELIN IS WORTHLESS.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is Maiden's best album as far as the older stuff goes.  After this CD came Somwehere in Time and Maiden's turn to more progressive stuff. It's one of the last older style of playing sounding albums.   This CD is one I like to listen to its entirety.  It's that damn good.  Huge vocals and awesome riffs.  Maiden somehow manages to make repetiveness not boring.  This was the first time I got to see Maiden live.  Seeing them play ROTAM live was phenominal.  I wish they would include more songs from this album like Flash and Duelist in their live shows as they are just as good, if not better than Acs or 2 min to Midnight.

B00000JCOV|1.0|All of you people make me sick. How can you enjoy something like this, let alone take them seriously with those ridiculous maks? I'm sorry, but Slipknot is a joke. A musician myself, this \\"garbage in is garbage out\\". Playing both guitar and bass I can't help but chuckle knowing that they have no musical prowess. Prove to me that you have talent. Drop D barring gets old, at least rip a solo over the top. Did you just say \\"What is a solo?\\" I must provide a definition. \\"A solo is an improvization of notes usually in a scale that fits the key signature of the song.\\" If you dont rip solos or have crazy interludes, there is no point to having dual guitars! I can't believe sober people would spend 15 bucks on this junk. This definetly shows what trash Roadrunner Records signs. RIP Dimebag, I wish you were still here to show these \\"maggots\\" what real shredding is. <br /> <br />I have listened to all of their albums with nothing other than dissapointment. I have never seen them live, don't get me wrong, if you just want to mosh, this is your ticket.  <br /> <br />Corey Taylor and Joey Jordison are the only members of the band that have any skill. Corey is one of the few singers that can be melodic and understandable when screaming. Joey is quite impressive in his own also. I'm dissapointed that neither of them could find another niche in making good music. Their other bands are better than Slipknot, but still a waste of money.  <br /> <br />Bottom line-If you are reading my review and thinking to yourself, \\"this guy doesn't know crap and doesn't appreciate Slipknot\\" then go home and listen to \\"Push it\\" by Static X you talent deaf dumb@sses. <br /> <br />If you want a definition of what I mean, check out these songs. <br />\\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallica <br />\\"Cowboys from Hell\\" by Pantera <br />\\"Aces High\\" by Iron Maiden <br />\\"Eternal Rest\\" by Avenged Sevenfold <br />\\"Ace of Spades\\" by Motorhead <br /> <br />Now that you are converted to STRAIGHT METAL, start checking outother classics instead of the new Rammstein album. <br />

B00006FX83|3.0|My first thought when setting out to write this review was, 'Hmmm, I wonder how many irrelevant and obscure titles I can work into the review, that may or may not shed some light on the subject matter at hand?'<br /><br />I am a fairly well-read person (I am told I am too modest, and that I qualify as a very well read person, but I don't want to claim too much, lest some diabolic force leap forward to claim me back for my sin of pride, a particularly bad thing for those of holy orders, as every guide and advice to the priestly states since the days of Irenaeus). But I digress.<br /><br />But this is in keeping with the flavour of the novel. Unless you like digression, stay far away (run, don't walk!) from this novel. But, if you go in for the seemingly endless, barely understandable and eventually irrelevant, then by all means, this is the book for you.<br /><br />I would not have read this book but for the urgings of friends who were similarly reading this, and wanted to compare notes. Thanks, guys!<br /><br />Now, I must hasten to add at this point, I did find myself enjoying the book several times. I don't mind the digressions, but I found the attempts (subtle but there) to equate Corso with a Holmesian character unconvincing (and the attempts were subtle enough that Perez-Reverte could claim they aren't actually there). Apart from Holmes, he ignores most of English literature--when he talks of those who wrote in serial form, i.e, Stendahl et alia, he neglects those such as Dickens.<br /><br />I would love to have the card catalogue Perez-Reverte was sitting next to as he wrote this; perhaps he used Amazon.com and other internet searching to add that final irrelevant entry in each of the listings of books.<br /><br />I am a bibliophile. I sit in a room, such as Perez-Reverte describes in several places, where shelves sag on walls groaning from the strain of heavy books, heavy in content as well as mass weight. I have several such rooms in my home. But I couldn't quite find the same love of books in this book, where sometimes bibliophilia was a fetish, and other times a useless detail.<br /><br />Basic plot--is it a murder or is it a suicide? What does the manuscript have to do with it? Dumas (who wrote, among other things, the stories involving the Musketeers) is seemingly at the centre of things, along with a possibly-phoney book of occult forbidden knowledge, for which men will die (obviously) or kill. There is diabolic force at work, maybe. Corso is the rare-books expert called in to investigate the case, who doesn't always like the role of policeman.<br /><br />Perez-Reverte seems intent on impressing us with his erudition in the field of literature and continental travel. It would be impressive if it were consistent and organised along better lines, and woven into a story where such details made a contribution. This book, as a mystery, fails to deliver because it both gives more information than is necessary (which can be an effective device, forcing the reader to separate 'the wheat from the chaff', or figure out which strands to follow; sadly, that is not the case here) and insufficient information in the strands which count to allow the reader to 'figure it out' (another sin, often difficult to avoid when one is trying for a 'complex' novel; even Conan Doyle frequently failed on this point).<br /><br />In all, this is an inventive idea, with interesting character formation; for some reason, neither the story nor the characters get developed sufficiently (either in size or direction) to make this a first-class novel.<br /><br />The New York Daily News described this book as 'A cross between Umberto Eco and Anne Rice' (Eco is very prominent here, as Perez-Reverte is obviously trying to emulate and cash in on Eco's prominence in the richer-and-book-purchasing English-speaking world). The New Yorker gets even more, well, New-Yorker-ish: 'A noir metafiction [please someone, tell me just what that means, in English??] Even a reader armed with a Latin dictionary and a copy of The Three Musketeers cannot anticipate the thrilling twists of this stylish, Escher-like mystery.'<br /><br />Perhaps one of the reasons one cannot anticipate 'the thrilling twists' is the inconsistency in the novel? Just a thought.<br /><br />Escher-like...well, yes, you read one thing and it turns out to be another (for instance, I thought I was reading a great novel, and it turned out to be...)<br /><br />No, that is unfair.

B00005JOWR|5.0|Thank you for Smoking is a subversive story about spin and the people who engage in it. Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, the spokesman for Big Tobacco, whose job is not so much to defend cigarettes as it is to descredit those who oppose them, which he does with great alacrity. William H. Macy is a crusading Senator who wants to put a skull and crossbones on every pack of cigarettes, whom Naylor shows to be in the pay of the cheese industry, which clogs arteries. Katie Holmes is the reporter who will do anything (and I mean anything) to get a story. The precoious Cameron Bright is Nick's son, who is increasingly admiring at his old man's skill at selling a product that kills 1200 people a day.<br /><br />The story of Nick Naylor's rise (as he tries to get cigarettes back into the movies; the image of Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta Jones having a smoke after zero gravity sex in a scifi movie is an image that should have gone on the screen), his fall due to Katie Holme's reportage and an absurd kidnapping by anti tobacco terrorists, and his rise again is both instructive and entertaining. Recommended to all who want to see all sides of an important debate and laugh at them.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I was very surprised at how good this movie was. I didn't like Ray at all so I was prepared for the same reaction with Walk The Line. However it's a great story with a great ending. In my opinion Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of June Carter is spectacular and very deserving of the Oscar she won for it; to me her performance helps make the movie as powerful as it is. Not to downplay the performance of Joaquin Phoenix because he was also very captivating and gave an incredible performance. I also love the fact that they did all the songs themselves, they did a great job with the singing also. Overall, great great movie; so much better than Ray. I totally recommend it!

B000002LLC|5.0|Ok, everyone keeps calling this a sondtrack album. Wrong! This is an album of songs FROM AND INSPIRED by the film Dick Tracy. There are only three songs on the ablum that are actually from the film.  <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite Madonna albums and it was the album that proved that she could really sing. True, Evita, would prove that even more, but at the time this was Madonna's best vocal performace todate. Her performance of the song Sooner or Later is a wonder to behold. This was my first Madonna album and at the time is was my favorite. It still holds a soft spot in my heart (along with Erotica, Like A Prayer and Bedtime Stories).  <br /> <br />I was never impressed with Madonna from the moment I heard Holiday on the radio back in the early eighties. I began to warm to her with True Blue and Like A Prayer really made me sit up and take notice. However, I still wasn't impressed enough to pruchase any of her albums. Then Dick Tracy came out. The movie impressed me so much that I saw it ten times in the theatre. Madonna's singing in the film impressed me even more. So, I decided to pick up her I'm Breathless album. I'm so gald that I did. In the summer of 90 I just about wore the album out from continuous listening.  <br /> <br />There are a couple of track that I'm not wild about. I'm Going Banannas still sort of grates on my nerves and Now I'm Following You is rather weak, but overall Madonna's voice just shines on this album. Singing 30's and 40's style songs wasn't all that easy for Madonna as she freely admitted during the production of Dick Tracy, but she worked at it and eventually felt confident enough to release this album. I'm sure that this is album is one of her more personal albums. I get the impression from listenign to this album that Madonna recorded it more for herself than the legions of Madonna fans. It shows in her performance.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and give this album a serious chance. Listen with an open mind and her howMadonna manages to recreat the 30's and 40's with this music.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Im not going to go around and tell you how wonderful this movie is because at this point in time their are 618 other people that have done that so Im going to keep it short and sweet, I have seen the King Kong from both the 30's & the 70's and from this idea and screenplay it could not have been anybetter Peter Jackson did what any great director making a re-make should do, which is follow the 1st (which he did), nail the details (uh.. have you seen how long it is...) & modernize It without ruining the atmosphere from the first (check!), everthing falls into place exactlly like I'd hoped .... nothing short of great!      P.S I just wanted to let everyone thinking about buying this film that if you do ... than you should buy this version, the 2-disked one, its got some great commentary & lots of others things that the others just dont have, not to mention its only a few dollars more. GREAT DEAL...!     Grade: A-
B00005T7I1|4.0|I saw this film ten times in the theatre when it was released in 1990. The entire look of the film just blew me away. And 90% of the characters looked exactly like their comic strip counterparts. Beaty did an amazing job on this film. It's one of my all time favorites.  <br /> <br />However, I was really disappointed in this DVD. No trailers, TV spots, no making of documentary, nothing but the film. Now, the Disney channel did air a making of special in 1990 and it could have been inclued on this DVD. I have it on tape, not to mention several trailers and TV shops for the film and KD Lang and Take Sixes 'Ridin' The Rails' music video. I also know of a couple of deleted scenes that showed up in the trailers. All of this stuff Touchtone has in their vaults and should have been included on the DVD. Shame on them.  <br /> <br />As for the film itself, well because I love the movie so much I had to pick it up even if it is a bare bones release. The sound and picture are great and it was nice to see it again in widescreen. I would recomend that you rent it if you have to see it. If you have to buy it, wait for a special edition or Director's Cut to come out.

Not for the closeminded, he's gonna rock you, then slow it down for some nice slow jams, crank it back up to hiphop, maybe some country flavor.. You just never know with prince.  Whether we like him or not, we have a admit that the guy is a musical genius.  There's just nobody who does what this guy does.  Maybe the \\"black beck\\" comment was meant to start some things.

This is Aadam Sandler's best perfomances (don't bother with Punch Drunk Love, pure crap). Some poeple may not like the fact that it's mot a pure comedy, it's part drama. Others may not like that fact that Sandler doesn't take advantage of Paz Vega, he stays faithful and does what's best for the family. It's a well written, well acted movie. Cloris Leachman is very funny as Tea Leoni's mother, Leoni is good too. Everyone gives a good performance. It's a sweet, subtle film that should be given a chance. Sandler has grown up, and I would love to see more of it.

0060736267|5.0|There's nothing I can add to the many fine detailed plot summaries already here, so I'll just say that I agree with countless critics more learned than I who put this on the very short list of Great American Novels.      I have given it to every young girl I care about, starting with my four daughters and eight granddaughters, and I felt like a real sexist when one of my nine grandsons told me he borrowed his sister's copy and thought it the best book he'd ever read.    The Dorothy McGuire/Peggy Ann Garner movie, by the way, is one of those very rare movies that almost do justice to a great book.  Don't miss it, either.
B000AADYYO|3.0|I have a nostalgic fondness for Opeth, as they were the first non-traditional metal band I listened to. However, I am now interested in truly heavy music, and honestly found the progressive elements here somewhat boring. Hell, this album doesn't have progressive elements, it is progressive - with some metallic touches. Still, it's a pleasant listen, with Mikael's clean vocal's showing he has some talent here; I still think his death growl is one of the best out there. Interesting rhythms (including Middle Eastern influences - think Led Zep's 'Kashmir') show that Martin Lopez is one of the major keys to this band's success.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is supposed to be more occult than the last albums, but I found the lyrics less profound - is this Roadrunner talking? Opeth's lyrics were what first drew me to them, and songwriting is their greatest strength - sadly, I think it's rarely matched by musicianship. The changes from promising heaviness to repetitive acoustic interludes mean I rarely listen to any of their material besides \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\". If you're into melodic death metal, get that album and listen to it on dark, rainy, quiet days. <br /> <br />Anyway, this isn't a bad album as such, just not very heavy. If you liked Damnation, this is for you. If you're into death, black, doom or viking metal, steer clear and save your money for something truly heavy. I recommend getting Opeth's lyrics off the net, though; they are truly worth reading, even if the music is disappointing.
B000CDIOYO|5.0|The great North German choral tradition goes back to the 16th and 17th Centuries; especially noteworthy is the sacred music of Heinrich Schutz, whose compositions included three 'dramatic' unaccompanied Passions, the finest and last of a venerable tradition. Following the premier of his Dafne (the first German opera) in Torgau, Schutz traveled to Venice in 1628. There, he studied at first hand the developments in dramatic music under the guidance of Claudio Monteverdi. Thus, the development of sacred Church music (especially the oratorio), of dramatic music for the theater (the newly created opera) and of a new expressiveness in instrumental music (the polyphonic and concertato styles) are joined in a direct lineage that extends from Italy to northern Germany. Each of these elements found their way into Schutz's late period compositions. His music, largely to German texts, are the embodiment of Luther's attempts to establish the German vernacular as a literary and liturgical language, and exemplifies the Protestant and humanistic concept of musica poetica in perhaps its finest form until Bach.<br /><br />As the Cantor of the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, Bach was often called upon to arrange performances of Schutz's sacred music. The prolific Bach family was influential in north German music for centuries; Johann Sebastian was thoroughly infused with the spirit of Lutheran sacred music. It is hardly surprising that in 1727 Bach felt compelled to set the somber St. Matthew Passion into a monumental musical edifice rather than face setting the annual Good Friday Passion anew each year. This represented the last major new composition for the Leipzig congregation. The few large sacred pieces of the future, such as the B Minor Mass, are essentially adaptations of music written for other occasions. Bach had wearied of the numerous and protracted struggles with the Leipzig town fathers and it was this slightly embittered but determined Bach who created a composition representing a summing-up of his art. Bach would resort to this creative tactic again. The B minor Mass, the Art of Fugue are other examples of great compendium works. Bach may well have been the first composer with a strongly developed sense of musical historicity, in an era when music was written \\"for use\\" and then routinely discarded and quickly forgotten. It is ironic that Bach, himself, was nearly forgotten by history. Only with the 1829 revival of the work in Leipzig by Felix Mendelssohn was the great St. Matthew Passion and its composer removed from limbo.<br /><br />Unlike Richter's recently released DVD performances of the B Minor Mass and Brandenburg Concertos, this St. Matthew Passion is not a hybrid performance incorporating old and new techniques. Rather, it is firmly in the 19th Century performance tradition. Using massive double choruses (including children), the Munchener Chorbuben and the Munchener Bach-Chor, and the large Munchener Bach-Orchester, Richter creates a \\"sublime monumentality\\". The singing style is emotional, even over-wrought, when called for by the text. Violins are liberal in their use of vibrato. Woodwind soloists play with an operatic legato smoothness. Cellos sob expressively. This is really big brawny Bach, reminiscent of Klemperer's classic 1962 EMI recording of the St. Matthew Passion. Tempos are nearly as slow and grand as a live recording I have that was conducted by Furtwangler in the early 1950s. If you are only familiar with the authentic performance style of John Eliot Gardiner's fine 1989 Arkiv recording, for example, this performance will be a musical body blow. Questions of authenticity aside, it is this stately Bach that has the longer history. It is its unflinching theatricality that I find most appealing. This Passion contains the greatest of all human emotions. The music reflects it. I find nothing wrong in embracing Bach's profundity if it is done well. This performance, recorded 15-23 May 1971 in Munich at the Bavaria Atelier, is superb. Therefore, it is well worth your serious consideration.

0800177177|1.0|I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be a great retelling of my favorite book, Bram Stoker's Dracula. What I got was a lot of heartache. Francis Ford Coppala took the greatest Vampiric Horror Story of all time, and turned it into a love story between Dracula and his long-lost love, who happens to look like Mina Harker. If that wasn't bad enough, every one of the principle female characters, including Drac's brides, were topless at least once during the movie. It was disgusting. The only good part to this movie was Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Abraham Van Helsing. A great performance that should have been in a different Dracula picture.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Well, I saw the Japanese version and if you know the series you will recognize many things in this movie, but even if you don't know (something that I doubt) you will really enjoy this film...the graphics, the story, the action are really entertaining...I highly recommend this DVD. You won't regret it. Trust me.
B000E0OCHI|1.0|Quite frankly I find it amazing that anyone could take this film seriously. Obviously the director browsed an abridged, paper-back version of the novel and saw extracts from the 1995 BBC version and considered that enough to inspire this truly awful rendition. The settings were plain wrong, the characters lacked charm and the intense moments were utterly painful. <br /> <br />Historical details such as male characters walking un-announced into ladies bedrooms are utterly incorrect (such as the scene when Jane is unwell and Bingly wanders in). The setting of the Bennett family (pretentious aristocracy) amid the muck and peasantry of a farm is likewise unsupportable. (Can anyone explain why in one brief 'cut' there is a sailing dinghy in the middle of the farmyard??) <br /> <br />Overall the film lacks any of the charm and wit of Austen and is in no way of sufficient quality to be a drama in its own right.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|After having watched the BBC's mini series, I din't expect anything else to even come close to it.But this movie was a pleasant surprise. Although some of the dialogues were cut short due to time contraints , the movie is a very faithful adaptation of Austen's classic. <br /> <br />Keira Knightly is convincing as Elizabeth Bennet. The scenary of 18th centaury England was well captured. Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet surpassed the perfomances in the BBC mini series. I shall be watching this over and over again.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Here I am two weeks after rushing to pick up what is hands-down my favorite collection of music to be released this year. It took time for me to collect my thoughts enough to write what I feel when I listen to On the Jungle Floor.  Only two years after the release of his debut and Van has me at full attention. Granted, I heard a good number of the tracks at a local performance just a week before I bought the CD, then I listened to the sneak preview on VH1. Now is different. To listen to \\"If I Take You Home,\\"  \\"Being A Girl,\\" \\"The Thrill of this Love\\" whenever I want, grants me pure bliss.     \\"Mean Sleep,\\" features another underrated child of funk soul by the name of Nikka Costa. To hear them sing in a duet co-written by Cree Summer is like a dream come true. Then to follow it up with \\"Priest or Police\\" was such a wise powerful choice. Although it was difficult to choose one that stands out in this melange of funk, rock, soul, topped off with lyrical wisdom, this track has a place on my list of favorites. \\"Character,\\" the lead single goes without description. Van Hunt has a certain way of making art of his words, then performing them in such a poetic yet convincingly honesty manner. There is a range of love, desire, infidelity, groupies...and it's done in a way only he can do it. One can feel his undeniable passion in \\"Hole in My Heart,\\" then take a trip back to the retro sound of 80's funk on \\"At the End of the Slow Dance.\\"     Yes, his musical influences can be heard. That simply means that he has completely learned from everything he has been inspired to become. There is a clear difference from being influenced by musical geniuses and merely copying another person's style. With this release, Van has completely secured himself a place with the true musical talent, a REAL pioneer...I just hope he keeps doing it and that the world wakes up and listens to what he has to offer...incredible!     If you like music...truly like music., then there is something for you onhere.  One you cannot miss: \\"Suspicion (She Know Me Too Well).\\"  Don't miss out.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|Perched high atop the list of the finest American movies of the 1950's, Fred Zinnemann`s \\"The Nun's Story\\" is an intensely beautiful and powerful film about a woman who undergoes a crisis of faith and, through her struggle, learns the importance of finding one's true path in life.  Based on the novel by Kathryn Hulme, the film tells the story of Gabrielle van der Mal, a Belgian woman who enters the convent in the 1930`s, spends a brief period working as a nurse in the Congo, then leaves the order after years of intense personal struggle with herself and with God.  Among American films of its time, \\"The Nun's Story\\" stands virtually alone in its ability and willingness to dramatize a conflict taking place in the deepest recesses of a character's mind and soul.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn - sans makeup and the kind of fashion-plate wardrobe that had already become the hallmark of her movie career - delivers one of her richest performances as the strong-willed and fiercely independent Sister Luke, whose very psyche is torn asunder by the battle between her own innate, personal pride and a sincere desire to live a life of obedience to the Church and its rules.  With everything but her countenance hidden beneath a nun's habit, Ms. Hepburn is forced to draw on her resources as an actress, having to convey the titanic internal conflict taking place within her character almost entirely through facial expressions, vocal intonations and body language.  And she proves herself more than equal to the challenge.  She is brilliantly complemented by Peter Finch, playing the cynical but humane Dr. Fortunati, a dedicated surgeon who is as concerned about Sister Luke's spiritual health as her physical health.  The relationship between the two is handled with a great deal of subtlety and tact, never allowing the obvious romantic attraction between the two attractive people to come too much to the fore.  Rounding out the excellent cast are Dean Jagger as Gabrielle's loving and concerned father, Peggy Ashcroft and Mildred Dunnock as two older nuns who help guide Sister Luke along the way, and the incomparable Edith Evans, simply astounding as the Reverend Mother who sees unwavering devotion to God and the Church as the one and only goal of a serious nun.<br /><br />Among other things, \\"The Nun's Story\\" is that rare film dealing with religion and spirituality that doesn't contain a single hokey or sentimental moment, that knows the difference between religion and religiosity, that is respectful without being unduly reverential, and that acknowledges the complexity of the human heart in matters of devotion and faith.  It also is not afraid to take its time to set the scene and tell its story, never feeling the need to rush headlong into the next dramatic moment just to keep the movie going.  In a perfect blending of form and content, the film is every bit as thoughtful, subtle and contemplative as its subject matter, its mood greatly enhanced by the rich and evocative Franz Waxman score that underlines the seriousness of the work.<br /><br />In addition to all its other fine virtues, \\"The Nun's Story\\" features one of the greatest final scenes and closing shots in motion picture history, a masterpiece of precision and understatement that demonstrates the kind of taste Zinnemann always displayed as a director.  The movie is made up of small, beautifully observed moments that, when put together, provide a powerful glimpse into the heart and life of a fascinating, caring individual who wants to do great things in the world but who realizes that the path she has chosen is not the one that will ultimately lead her to her rightful destiny.<br /><br />On every level of filmmaking, this is truly one of the greats.eggy Ashcroft and Mildred Dunnock as two older nuns who help guide Sister Luke along the way, and the incomparable Edith Evans, simply astounding as the Reverend Mother who sees unwavering devotion to God and the Church as the one and only goal of a serious nun.

0393320928|4.0|This book alone is very enlightening. In the first half of the book, you get a sense of Feynman's early beginnings and  how his fascination with science evolved. In his adolescent years, Feynman was influenced the most by his father. Although his father was not a professional scientist, he was stated as always having the right principle. In this autobiography Feynman recalls certain memories of his life, some not having anything to do with science whatsoever, but they all lead up to the investigation of the NASA shuttle the Challenger in the Part II. Feynman was appointed to the presidential commission that was in charge of figuring out why the dramatic and surprising crash of the shuttle occurred. There was no blatant evidence as to why the shuttle exploded, but Feynman had several ideas why it might have happened. He was presented with the idea that the solution to the problem lied in the O-rings in the rocket boosters. In this book he guides readers through his thought process and a first person description of his famous experiment with ice water and rubber clasps to prove his unbelievable theory. He proved that the O-rings do not work efficiently in cold temperature, specifically if it is 32 degrees or below. The temperature on the day of the launch was not in safe range. Feynman was right. His report was included in the appendix of the official document sent to the government stating the purpose of the crash. This report is also included in the book.  Many professionals in the science field doubted Feynman and his ideas. He was usually \\"brushed\\"  off and his opinions were never really taking into consideration during the public meetings of the commission. What readers will get out of this book is a true sense of how brilliant a man Richard Feynman was. He was truly an original and he wrote this book to show the public the way his mind works and how superficial people might be no matter how smart they are supposed to be.
1559408855|1.0|I don't get it. Judging from the reviews, some people actually like this movie, or so they say. Well let me tell you what: if you really enjoy this film, that means you're stupid. Unless you're lying to yourself and others, for some reasons, being dumb is your only exuse for praising it.  <br /> <br />Salo is based on de Sade's book. I've read some parts of it and it was worthless. All it contains is large amounts of boring philosophy, which, I'm sure, no one even bothers to read because it's so dull, and even larger amounts of different abominations that the authors two-dimensional characters do upon each other.  <br /> <br />The movie is not better. The whole point of it is that the fascists did some bad things. Well duh.  <br /> <br />So, is this a high class piece of art? My ass. Is it at least as disgusting as they say it is? Yes it is. But if you really need to puke for some reasons, then why don't you just stick two fingers down your throat and save your time.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I absolutely love this great album, this album rocks. The best songs are jesus of suburbia, Holiday, Give me Novacaine, Homecoming, & Whatsername. and then the worst songs are She's a rebel, Extraordinary girl, & letterbomb. The rest is pretty rocking. one of my favorite albums, get this with any dire straits album, or gnr album they are just as great as GREEN DAY. <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb of God first established itself in 1990 under the name \\"Burn the Priest.\\"  So by now, these guys really know how to tear it up musically, most noteably Chris Adler [drums].  Chris does an amazing job rippin up the skins on every track, he also plays the piano, the acoustic guitar, the saxophone, and the bass guitar.  Brother, Willie Adler [guitar] is an outstanding guitar player exercising flawless technicality with the ferocious shredding which we've all grown to love in modern Thrash.  David \\"Randy\\" Blythe [vocals] isn't your typical growler either, his lyrics are pretty vicious and well thought out.  They even throw in the \\"Italian Mafia Code of Honor\\" in the track \\"Omerta.\\"  Overall, this is an outstanding follow up to 2003s \\"As Palaces Burn\\" which is also a kick ass record if i say so myself, and gives hope to there thrash metal following that has been growing since the early 90s.  I'd recommend this album to anyone who listens to God Forbid, Children of Bodom, Unearth, or whenever your just ROCKIN' WITH YOUR C*CK OUT.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I'm totally in love with this great album. it has some really great songs. I think Mark knopfler does Tunnel of Love really well and it is one of my top 5 favorite songs of all time, and it is really really lovely. please play it at any party. Romeo and Juliet is a great song too, great lyrics and music. But my other favourite one is Espresso love. I think Knopfler does that one really well too, and so for Solid rock and Skateaway. This is one album every rock fan must listen to. I want more and more and more of this album. I love it. Please buy this right now.
B000FA57N0|3.0|Unfortunately, i found this a let down of a film based on a wonderfully subtle originial t.v. show that i think should have satayed as it was. This just raised questions for and confused me as to why they would do the things they did to the characters. Dont read this if u havent seen it yet!!! But why kill Wash? Why destroy the ship? Why put the crew in excessive needless amounts of danger at the end which caused somehow a masacre, i didnt feel like they had won at the end, did u? I felt let down and frustrated by this, but thats just me.
B00004XONN|3.0|3 1/2 stars <br /> <br />..This is when Radiohead gave the finger to preconcieved notions of what they should sound like, and thanks to their immense talent as a collective manage to succeed..While not the holy revelation of music some make it out to represent, it does show that if a band earnestly tries to venture out into unknown territory, they will perservere if they possess the conviction and talent to remake their own image, despite having the weight of the critical world on your shoulders...Few bands could go from producing such consistently romantic gutair epics to making such profoundly mechanical songs such as \\"idioteque\\" in one simple album...
B000E6UK5K|1.0|Before I even begin this review, allow me to state for the record that I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd, and of David Gilmour. Gilmour is one of the greatest guitar players (not to memtion an underrated singer and songwriter) from one of the greatest bands of all time. Both of his prior solo albums were good, if not great. All this makes his latest solo effort, \\"On an Island,\\" quite a disappointment in comparison. <br />   To put it quite simply, it's boring. The songs lack good writing (thank you, polly samson), the music is largely uninspired, Gilmour's usually-amazing guitar solos are mediochre at best, and the songs simply have nothing to say.  <br />   The album starts off with a \\"Castellorizon,\\" a fairly pointless instramental piece. The title track, \\"On an island,\\" does feature some amazing harmony, but that's about all it has going for it. \\"The Blue\\" is a subdued instramental with decent guitar, but it's not very memorable. \\"Take a Breath\\" is an upbeat number, the only one on tha album. It's actually not bad, probably because it's the only track that doesn't sound like all the other songs. This Heaven\\" begins with an interesting folkish guitar bit, but quickly degenerates into listless drivel.  <br />   As for the other five tracks, the only thing I can remember about any of them as I write this is that they were slow and uninteresting. Other than a vague recollection of disliking them, They left no impression on me at all. <br />   If you are buying this hoping for a substitute to Pink Floyd, you're just asking for disappointment. And even if you accept that this album will sound very little loke Floyd, chances are you still will regret buying it. So don't.
B00005ATQF|3.0|This movie tends to inspire a lot of deep philosophizing, since the director, Stanley Kubrick, is considered the second best American director and the subject, Vietnam, is one of angst and introspection. There are a lot of deep things you can take from this. The split between the first and second half is either a brilliant metaphor for the duality of man or an embarassing plot kink that throws off the mood of the film. The first half training scene achieves a visceral level of imagery that is probably likely to endure on a wider level than any deeper philosophical musings, however. <br /> <br />Overall however this was an entertaining movie with plenty of drama and action. One problem though is that the sets used in the second half seemed to be rather reptitive. It kind of felt like the platoon was walking through a movie studio and not a burned out town. I have to give it credit for originality, however.
B000002UAR|5.0|There is not much to say that hasn't been said in the last 40 years about Revolver.  I certainly cannot add much to the discussion other than to say every rock music fan should own this album.<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper's gets all the notice for being the groundbreaking album of the 60's, but Revolver is, top to bottom, a superior work.<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" still sends shivers down my spine.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I first bought this album after only knowing the song She Don't Use Jelly, which seems to be their one big commercial release and the only song most Lips laymans know. At first, i didn't know what to think...all the effects and samples were confusing and jumbled and the vocals seemed to be lost underneath. I put it aside and promptly forgot about it. Rummaging through my collection one day, i thought, why not? Ever since then i haven't been able to stop listening to it...what at first seems jumbled and confusing becomes beautifully complex and layered, and the amazing lyrics really shine, finding a firm place in Cyber-punk culture (possibly the best musical contribution i've heard). Basically it's amazing and i have to agree with all the other reviewers when they say that Do You Realize is briliant...it breaks and remakes your heart at every listen...do yourself a favour and give it a chance...
B0000CF30C|5.0|I recently purchased a 5.1 surround sound system. Naturally I needed to load up on some 5.1 CD's. I did alot of poking around, bought a few. Some impressed me some did not. Then I rememebered getting a SACD Sampler from Rolling Stone magagzine. Aerosmith's \\"Sweet Emmotion\\" is on it. Without a doubt , this is what SACD's should sound like. Alot of SACD's sound like an entirely new mix. Many things are lost (like the bass) and others are too prominent in the mix. This one just kicks. When the bass comes in and the song starts to rock, your'e SO glad you have it in SACD!!! The album is a classic, there should be no doubt about that. This just improves upon it. Highly recomended.
B000069KGM|5.0|AND HERE IT IS - ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS AN AMERICAN BAND HAS EVER CREATED (in my opinion).  Listen (yes there is a song on here by that name) to Terry Kath's ferocious guitar work throughout.  This dude would have gone into spontaneous combustion without that outlet I think!  He can sing too, and with so much soul...what an asset to the band.  And he had better be with Daniel Seraphine's whirlwind power drumming and Peter Cetera on bass, this combo moved musical mountains by force of will (all could sing well, but Cetera was the harmony master it seems, check out the synergistic energy these young dudes could pull together, WOW).  I guess Robert Lamm was often in the lead vocalist spot along with keyboard duties, but they all shared the spotlight nicely, his voice and songwriting are classic early Chicago.  What would Chicago be without the signature horn section dynamics (fade in/outs, precision staccato explosions of sound, harmonic counterpoint), they do it all with such power and style.  This recording had an inordinate influence on the music world, and rock world especially.  There is a very progressive influence here, American style.  The whole big band type of horn section mixed with acid rock was ground-breaking, and many tried to do their thing with it later to less success generally.  Worth mentioning are the intense contemplative lyrics on many topics, metaphysical and otherwise, that (from the story I remember) got the real transit authority to request a distancing name change.  This band was pretty revolutionary in every way.  Jimi Hendrix even allegedly stated that Kath was better than him (somewhat modestly, I'm sure Kath would humbly disagree).  If you are looking for a new classic album to absorb, you can't go wrong with this one - IT ROCKS BIG TIME!  All other readers familiar with this (who like harder rock albums) won't need any convincing, this is the foundation from which Chicago built an empire.  And this remaster of the original double album is very nicely done with a nice long essay, good track notes, many pictures and original artwork (about 77 minutes).  You've got to love it!  I always go back to this masterpiece when I want inspiration on many levels, 5 stars barely does it justice.

B000CBSHK2|4.0|Beth Orton is a talented and elcectic singer-songwriter with a pretty good track record for releasing quality albums.  I was please to here that COMFORT OF STRANGERS was to be a bare bones release, focusing on songs rather than arrangements.  Most of Beth's other albums have been the type that need to grow on you over time, sometimes due to their eclectic range.<br /><br />Well, COMFORT OF STRANGERS is a solid album, but some reason I was expecting more.  In the past I would notice a well written song hidden beneath a fussy arrangement.  Here, I notice a instrumental detail beneath a song.  I've only had this a couple weeks, and as I stated, I'm aware that this album will most likely come into sharper focus over time, but thus far I'm a little underwhelmed.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are no glaring weaknesses, no songs that I feel compelled to fast forward past, and with WORMS,SHOPPING TROLLEY, HEART OF SOUL and HEARTLANDTRUCKSTOP comparing favourably with her previuos output.<br /><br />Considering that the artist herself, had said that this was her best work to date after trashing DAYBREAKER, an album that I thought was great, I am a little let down.  For all I know, this may kick in and leap to the top of her albums in my opinion, but at this point, I'll consider it a modest success worth returning to.

B00004T0US|5.0|Even though this was NOT the last album released it was the last in Elvis's life time, Elvis in concert was released AFTER Elvis had passed. now..on with the show. In my opinion, Moody Blue is a great album, it's never really been uncommon for artists to release an album and not have some live songs included. People want to hark on Elvis's take of Little Darlin' but need to understand, in retrospect, Elvis did have fun with it only because he really didn't care for the song to begin with. I remember where he had said once where he thought the song was kinda silly, So I think at the time it was recorded live, it was done as a spur of the moment thing to where something evidently reminded him of the song so he went into it. But because Elvis didn't record that much material for Moody Blue, RCA decided to include that and Let me be there which was from the live in Memphis album from '74. but as we all know, this was Elvis's last studio album and it was a memorable one at that with alot of great songs which include it's to hits, Way Down & Moody Blue. For the record, there was a version of Unchained Melody released with the full band as a single not long after Elvis had passed that did well on the charts.

B00005K3O4|5.0|First things first... One time, I let my friends four year old daughter watch this movie with me, after she begged and pleaded. I thought that maybe the horror would be tame and campy enough to slide, especially since the little girl thought that the clown picture on the front was hillarious, and since she loved dancing around her kitchen to my Killer Clowns from Outer Space soundtrack, by the Dickies. BUT, unfortunately, there was one scene in the movie, where a clown drinks blood out of a cotton candy cocoon with a twirly straw, that really freaked her out, and it took weeks for her (and her moms) to get over the fact that I let her watch it. (The girl actually yelled at me, for letting her watch a PG-13 movie... smart kid.)<br />ANYWAY... I think I myself, was only about six years old when I first saw this flick, and I've really loved it ever since. It's really bad, but in a good way. You can't top the special effects in this one, and the story is pretty great... clowns eat humans, and store them in a circus tent. Tons of circus like gags, and a really fun movie for all...  just make sure the kids have no problem with graphic scenes involving drinking blood from twirly straws...
0887307280|2.0|Given the hubris with which Michael Gerber unpacks his pearls of wisdom throughout this book, it is perhaps not surprising that he would refer to himself on the cover as \\"The World's #1 Small Business Guru\\". More surprising is the homage he pays to Don Juan Matus, a Yaqui medicine man (probably fictitious), and G.I. Gurdjieff, author of Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson, and originator of the esoteric path of knowledge known as the Fourth Way.<br /><br />What's this New Age mumbo jumbo doing in a business book? Your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />Gerber's thesis stripped of all this fluff is quite simple and unremarkable. He notes that most small business owners who see themselves as entrepreneurs are actually technicians; skilled workers in the production of whatever their business's product happens to be. Generally they lack management capability as well as true entrepreneurship - the envisioning of a primary aim and strategic objective and the development of a systems approach that will consistently produce the desired results. Gerber exhorts small business owners to see the big picture, take on the true entrepreneurial role, and in so doing, to work on, rather than in, their businesses.<br /><br />While this is good common sense advice, the assertion that any business can (or should) be reduced to a McDonald's like franchise prototype oversimplifies and distorts reality. The promise of powerful results that will automatically be achieved upon donning just the right color of a suit and tie and delivering a canned sales script is alluring but also dangerous. Things in the real world of business are not nearly as simple and mechanistic as Gerber would have us believe.<br /><br />I found the dialogue that runs throughout the book between the author and Sarah, the struggling proprietor of All About Pies, (a bakery), to be exceedingly annoying. In it, Gerber presents as a powerful and all knowing Svengali, weaving a hypnotic spell as he counsels his disciple in matters of the life and death of her business. Sarah is utterly compliant, totally receptive, and seems almost to be ravished by Gerber's surpassing prowess and wisdom. The smarmy tone of this is evident in quotations such as the following:<br /><br />\\"I could see that Sarah got it.<br /><br />I could see that the flush on her cheeks now had nothing to do with the work she'd been doing all day.<br /><br />I could see that her dark, intelligent, creative eyes were riveted on mine, and that the questions were bubbling within her...\\".<br /><br />Flush on her cheeks?

Trying to 'blow-the-doors-off the Joneses' is no way to live. Robert does a great job of making that clear for us.<br /><br />We can get rid of all that stress in life, and still live enriching, wonderful -- even affluent -- lifestyles, but so long as we are responsible and so long as we follow the advice of Robert Kiyosaki.<br /><br />RDPD is a classic. Take my word for it. You will enjoy it. But more so, you will get out of it far more than what you pay for it.
0446677450|5.0|I read this book with certain expectations, and was mildly disappointed.  That said, what I got was still good, and I have bumped this from 4 to 5 stars.<br />Due to the smashing ideas the book elicits in ones own mind, rather than the averaged-down material presented in the book, I gave a \\"good-faith\\" extra star.  Having read the second book as well, I will not be quite as kind to it in review, but in fairness, Kiyosaki doesn't profess to be a lawyer or CPA, so for a more in-depth treatment of the nuts-n-bolts of investing/getting rich/making money, I have to recommend Lynch, Cramer, Hill, ... and even the Rich Dad books written by \\"Rich Dad's Advisors\\", like the one on corporations.  It's an elementary level introduction to a new way of thinking, with some actual details that people like me worry about...  All in all, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a good read, it's an easy read, and it's a good start on the subject to get you motivated and headed in the right direction.  It will prime the pump for you.  Then you may want to go forward into more academic reading so you'll have concrete ideas about how to achieve your goals, and are not relegated to forever uttering vague, blue-sky mission statements about being rich one day.  That's exactly what Kiyosaki recommends...  You'll enjoy this book, and it'll make you want to read more.  One suggestion is:  remember \\"Schaum's Outlines\\".  They have academic treatments of Accounting, Investing, Mutuals, and so on.  I have found Schaum's Outlines (I've read 4 or 5 on vastly different subjects) to be excellent introductions to the \\"kernel\\" of a discipline.  Just an idea ... as for Rich Dad:<br />This is a good start for the long road ahead!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  You should know I research and read reviews and excerpts before deciding to invest my time and/or money in a book or product.

B00000IN5G|4.0|In 1999 COB released their 2nd album. This was the band's major breakthrough and one of their most popular albums. Although it isn't exactly perfect, this is a brilliant sophomore effort. The band managed to make a heavier, faster, deathier and overall better album from the debut 'Something Wild' (which kicked ass also). The keyaboards here are awesome. The guitarists also done well, although Alexi will get better on the next albums and so will his vocals, which are kinda lacking here and this is one of the 2 reasons I took a half-star from the rating (the other one is the guitars sound, which is kinda light),  but he still done excellent, considering his age back then (19-20). I'm not saying  the album is filler (it's as good as they say, trust me), it's just that to me at the first time, after listening to the mighty Follow the Reaper, this sounded quite average. But this has completely changed, it grew on you with time and now I think it's f**king awesome. The only song I never really got into is 'Black Widow'. But all the rest are great. 'Silent Night, Bodom Night' Bed of Razors' are the 2best songs on the album, they have the best lyrics, coolest riffs and melodies. Other favorites are 'Wearheart', 'Downfall', and the 2 \\"title tracks\\" (Hatebreeder & COB).    I guess this would be a fine place to start if you're new, although I think the 2 following albums (Follow the Reaper, Hate Crew Deathroll) are better. If you're a melodic death metal fan you must have this, in fact all the first 4 Bodom albums. The latest (Are You Dead Yet) wasn't bad by any means but it was a kind of a sell-out. It is also one of the better albums of '99. Bodom is one amazing band and is also one of the best in the genre, and it does say something since Melodic DM is probably the best subgenre of metal of these days. Nu-metal will never get anywhere close to it. I would also recommend Opeth's 'Blackwater Park', In Flames 'Whoracle', Soilwork's 'Predator's Portrait' etc. for great melodicDM.   \m/ UP THE IRONS \m/
B000AP04FG|1.0|The two \\"stars\\" are mass murderers while the whole pathetic mess glamorizes terrorism! Simply awful. Run don't just walk away from this abomination.
B0000025P9|3.0|I recently re-purchased Toto IV after being reminded by a guitar instructor of the brilliance of the musicians that created this album. It was one of my most-listened to LPs as a child back in the early 1980s, but years and experience drove a wedge between me and Toto. <br /> <br />The reunion was strange, to say the least. I had forgotten exactly how this record sounded, which is to say, it's all over the place! This explains why I love disjointed, eclectic records so much. Toto IV is just a grab bag of pop candy, executed with the grace and precision of enviable masters who conquered the music world and still command the respect of musicians the world over. <br /> <br />\\"Rosanna\\" was the song that hooked me. The piano and synthesizer driven tune is punctuated by the horns of rock band Chicago, whom Toto assisted with their David Foster-produced albums 16-18. \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" was one of the tunes that brought me back to this album. It's a tender ballad, with a dynamic arrangement that buzzed me like an illegal substance. I had forgotten how awesome the stop time in the middle of \\"Afraid Of Love\\" sounded -- and in hindsight, it also sounds like the musical source of Bryan Adams' \\"Summer of '69.\\" \\"Waiting For Your Love\\" totally sticks out, if anything because its funky groove makes it sound like a leftover from Michael Jackson's Thriller sessions. And little wonder, the guys from Toto were on that album as well. <br /> <br />I listen to this album, and I wonder why it never received any airplay on the classic rock stations I used to listen to. Once in a great while I might hear \\"Hold The Line,\\" but nothing from Toto IV. Granted, the four hit singles (\\"Rosanna,\\" \\"Make Believe,\\" \\"I Won't Hold You Back,\\" \\"Africa\\") are less rock and more pop, but album tracks like \\"Lovers In The Night,\\" \\"We Made It,\\" and \\"Afraid Of Love\\" rocked as much as anything by Foreigner or Boston. Everything on this album, except perhaps \\"It's A Feeling,\\" sounds as if it was crafted to be ahit. \\"It's A Feeling\\" is the closest thing to an 'art' piece here, taking an intelligent, philosophical view of a failed relationship with understated vocals. It's easily the most brilliant, haunting track on the album. <br /> <br />Ultimately though, the record wears thin after a while. It's a great time capsule, but there's little beneath the surface. This band could have been the next Yes if they had as much thematic variety and focus in their lyrics as they do with their musicianship. As it turns out, love is the most favored subject matter here, and lyrics of that type are a dime a dozen if you're not a poignant wordsmith of the order of Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell. I listen with awe and respect for these legendary players, but my level of enjoyment comes and goes like the high you get from eating too much candy -- it disappears quickly, and then you never want to touch the stuff for a long time, at least until you forget why you stopped eating it in the first place.
B000002U82|5.0|Well, actually everyone I run into seems to- at the very least- like this album. When people say songs flow together, as I have in my reviews, they really aren't considering flow the way Floyd did it. Each song is a prelude to the next; in the case of Dark Side of The Moon the album encompasses everything from anger, to lonliness, to biterness, to repression, desire and so on and so forth. Pink Floyd certainly isn't for everyone- although they have a HUGE fan base- and if you just begin this is certainly the place to do so. Buy this album and find out for yourself why so many love Pink Floyd. Maybe all of us have a place reserved on the dark side of the moon.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Hear me out. Bear with me. Take a knee...<br /><br />I was thinking about this the other night as my son watched Revenge of the Sith on DVD for the umpteenth time. As much as I love the fighting scenes in all the Star Wars Prequels, the movies do have a few flaws--and one glaring deficiency.<br /><br />Home.<br /><br />Or at least a sense of home.<br /><br />We all like the idea of Home. We long for Home--especially those of us who never will know the feeling (at least on this side of eternity). That's why we watch TV shows like Cheers or (God forbid) Friends. It is also why the first three Star Wars movies so completely eclipse the prequels...<br /><br />The Milenium Falcon is Home.<br /><br />In this movie the road/touring/stage is Home. It is a powerful Home. As messed up as their lives are at the moment, one cannot help but be attracted to Johnny and June as they sit in a roadside diner and comiserate.<br /><br />There are a lot of good things about this movie: pacing, acting, great cast--but this movie is something special because it nails its sense of Home.<br /><br />So George...here's hoping to a better job the next time out. Watching this movie might be a good start.
B00005UKE0|5.0|All Things Must Pass, but it sure would be a mistake to pass on this. All Things Must Pass might be not only a great album, but as an entire album- the best work any Beatle did (including the Beatles albums). This song has it all- slow, mellow, relaxing and perfect tempo to a little edgy and it all blends together perfectly. I could go and rate every song and how it adds and follows suit with the album, but out of respect of this album i'd rather those who haven't listened discover that themselves. My first listen I wasn't immediatly hooked, but by my third and fourth time it instantly became one of my favorites to play on a sunny day out on the porch. Do yourself a favor and see why George Harrison is so well respected in musical circles- this album is all you have to point to for justification.
0380778556|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Du Maurier was a genious in building up a reader-based perception of everything and then at some point revealing that what you think is not always what it is.<br /><br />At the beginning, the nameless second wife of Maxim seemed so shy and childish, but sometimes, her words struck me as clever and defying, she became someone who knew exactly what she wanted even from when she was in Monte Carlo. A fit rival for Rebecca. From the first impression made of the De Winters and Manderley till the last event gave such a full vision of who was Rebecca but at the same time also gave the reader a full understanding of who was the narrator.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I got the feel that I had just saw a painting, with clear focus, enigmatic strokes. By not mentioning the narrator's name, the author gave such a powerful focus on the whole story. Compared with Jane Eyre, this story is more a psychology drama rather than a romantic one. Rebecca was a more lively dead character than the first Mrs. Rochester.
1594143781|5.0|Amongst cinema fans Memento has been seen as a true classic and rated very highly. The film has had almost a cult following and its complex, and twisting plot with hints of information rather than the full story ideally lend it to such a following. Much has been made of the way the film is told backwards, but its more complex that this. There is a narrative that is told in reverse - but at the same time another narrative that runs forward, and in the last scene of the film the two combine. <br /> <br />Given its complexities and the chronology of events Memento is a film that has to be seen more than once. Thus it a perfect DVD purchase. This special edition comes on three disks with lots of extra featuers, of which my favourite was the 'Anatomy of a Scene'. This documentary takes you behind the scenes with detailed information that take your enjoyment of the film to another level. <br /> <br />Overall this is one of the best DVD special edition releases you could by. Highly recommended to everyone and a must for the memento fan.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|2000's smash hit X-Men certainly deserved a sequel (or two, or three), especially with all the cash it made and how the first one ended. Now the X-Men are back together once again, and this time they've got some new friends, including Nightcrawler and Pyro, and as well as some new enemies like William Stryker and Lady Deathstrike (his personal mutant \\"assistant\\"/slave). This time the X-Men find themselves locked in an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mystique (their nemeses from the first film) against an evil military scientist named William Stryker, whose main goal is to eradicate the world of mutants once and for all.<br /><br />X2: X-Men United is in many ways an improvement over the first film. It's more psychological, it's longer, there's more action, more mutants, more of Wolverine slicing it up and like the first film it's never boring or drags, right from the get-go X2 is fierce and exciting. In fact, X2 is almost the perfect comic book film... almost. The one little, weak link in X2, for me at least, was Nightcrawler. Now, I like the character of Nightcrawler, but I honestly didn't care that much for Alan Cumming, he came off as a bit weak, and kind of \\"dorky\\". The character of Nightcrawler really just seems like a huge convenience to the plot; like the scene where he rescues Rogue in the X-Jet, which was oh so very convenient. But the one thing I liked about Nightcrawler, besides that awesome opening sequence in the White House, was his religious side, which I thought was interesting and made me sympathize with the character a little more.<br /><br />Pretty much everything in X2 works perfectly fine, which I attribute all that success to the amazing cast (Jackman, McKellen, Stewart, Marsden, Janssen, Berry, Paquin, Cox, Romijn), and the fact that the film was written and directed by the same people who clearly knew what they were doing back in 2000, and here they show us once again they still know what they're doing, and they aren't afraid to up the ante and take it up a notch. If you liked the first X-Men there's really no reason at all why wouldn't enjoy or like X2 as much, or maybe even more than the first film. It still has those surprising moments of humor, and plenty of action, maybe even more so than the original. And like the original, X2 sets itself up for a third film; let's just hope it turns out (at the very least) as good as the first two films, if not better.ante and take it up a notch.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie is an instant classic!  Wow, what a gem!  It will stand beside (maybe even replace?) \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as THE period piece of all period pieces!    Let me just say, I rarely buy DVDs (especially without viewing them first), and I rarely watch movies again in a short time span.  However, after reading the reviews of this movie and finding my local library did not have it, I purchased the film.  I AM SO HAPPY I DID BECAUSE IT SURPASSED ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS!  This movie is so HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL and STUNNING that I have owned it for only five days and I've already watched it twice--and I can't wait to watch it again!  This movie just draws you in--it's so romantic and yet subtle, and it does a fabulous job exploring the social issues created by the Industrial Revolution.  It truly takes you on a remarkable journey, sweeping you off your feet!  The film makes you take a keen interest in the characters' lives, and you can't turn it off until you find out how it ends.  (And the ending is SUPERB!  *SIGH*  You will love it!  It's definitely THE most romantic movie ending I've ever seen, and it's accomplished with \\"less is more\\".  It's so tender and beautiful that I predict you'll watch the last 8 minutes over and over!)    The characters and their development are FABULOUS!  Mr. Thornton is so complex and has so many dimensions--you come to appreciate what a compelling character he is after exploring his motivations and thoughts during the course of the film.  And to see how tender he is at the end (and to see him smile!) is so breathtaking and satisfying!  Richard Armitage is STUNNING in this role.  He gives the performance of a lifetime--a certain classic.  He really made Mr. Thornton into a real person, a person you want to understand and want Margaret to love.  WOW!  I have to admit, I thought Daniela Denby-Ashe was a little weak as Margaret (she was just a little too breathy and whiny at moments for me), but Richard Armitage made up for everything andwas SUPERB.  Truly outstanding!      I'm on a period-movie kick right now (much to my husband's dismay!) and have watched \\"Wives and Daughters\\", A&E's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", the new \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and \\"North and South\\" over the space of two weeks.  I have to say, \\"North and South\\" is the one that I can't stop thinking about.  The music is hauntingly gorgeous, and the story has so many fabulous dimensions to draw you in.  You will not be disappointed!  An absolute classic!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I cannot tell you anything about this film that you do not already know from earlier reviews. I can only tell you how the movie affected me. <br /> <br /> I grew up watching Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Hopalong Cassidy, and all the other classic western stars, so the idea of watching a film about two cowboys in love with each other just did not seem to be a road I wanted to travel. It didn't feel right; especially as I was born into a time when same sex relationships were really looked down on. Or not acknowledged. But the script was by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, Ang Lee was the director, Heath Ledger has become a very interesting actor, and the rest of the cast was fine. So I picked up a copy of the film.  <br /> <br />No matter how you try to adapt and rethink your position as you age in a changing world those old devil hang-ups and prejudices sneak up on you. It took me three days to watch the first half of the film. Other than some nice scenery and a surprisingly good score it was very difficult to watch the growing bond between these two men. The first half only lays the groundwork for the second half of the movie and that is where you will see why all the acclaim and awards. I couldn't stop watching. <br /> <br />After a long introduction of the characters the second half begins to show them as people with a problem - and it was a problem for who they were and in that time - and how they dealt with it. The first half is necessary, but it is the second half that shines. If you have an ounce of soul you will feel the pain and the love as it builds to a final fifteen minutes that is as good as filmmaking gets. It will squeeze your heart. <br />
0156012197|2.0|Well.<br /><br />What is it about \\"Lovers\\" of this book that makes them so defensive? Hmm? If it's so great, don't worry about what 1% of the readers in the world think. Or is this place supposed to be a totalitarian world where everyone loves cheesy tomes that are abstract in an attempt to seem \\"deep\\"?<br /><br />First of all: as the other negative reviewers noted, it IS disjointed. There is no \\"premise\\" that makes sense. Yes, I get some of the ideas, but personally I would rather read some old Grimm's fairy tales to get the ideas espoused by it.<br /><br />Second: most people I know who LOVE this book also tend to fall for pretentious lit and movies. Like \\"The Lovely Bones\\" or \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" I don't normally call them on it, because they launch into diatribes about how \\"intolerant\\" and \\"negative\\" I am. Whatever they say! I love literature. I just don't like everything that you do! And I have the guts to say that THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES. THIS BOOK IS OVERRATED. I am not hating on the book. I just don't think it's at all charming or original.<br /><br />Third: I don't get why the author talks about how \\"lost\\" grown-ups are. I guess it would appeal to children, but at the same time, Roald Dahl does the same sort of thing without vilifying ALL grown-ups. It's the kind of book that (I find) appeals to people who long for, and miss, childhood. Although I personally do not find adulthood any easier (which I think, is the main attraction: simple pleasures for simple minds!), I am much happier to know that I can be in control of (at least) more things and that I can understand silly, so-called \\"Mysterious\\" things for the fake pretensions that they are.<br /><br />ALWAYS READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. If there is not a semblance of envy, or pure hatred, LISTEN TO THEM. If the book is so great, you will still love it. But perhaps some people are so easily swayed by (certain literature and) opinions, they are afraid to keep their minds open.<br /><br />That's all. Enjoy the book./>That's all. Enjoy the book.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This has to be the most thought-provoking movies ever! You have to watch this movie twice to catch everything, and you will want to! Just full of twists and turns and wonderfully strange characters. Jake Gyllenhaal is just amazing as Donnie Darko.If you enjoy sci-fi and crazy plot twists, then you will thoroughly appreciate Richard Kelly's masterpiece.d, in some cases, sheer lunacy. <br /> <br />Some critics have been comparing this to The Band.  The sepia tones of the cover (and the digitally washed DVD film) help give this impression.  It seems a little bit of a lazy comparison, really.  It's like a big session - maybe Springsteen's been getting into The Oyster Band lately!
B00030590I|4.0|If you like martial arts films in which swordfights take place between characters that seem to float on air, then Hero could be the film you've been waiting for.  Hero is full of exquisite scenery, vibrant colors, radical fight scenes and an awesome display of extras in epic proportions (it is said that 18,000 Chinese Army regulars played the role of the Qin army in the film). But unlike Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero's characters don't connect with the audience on an emotional level and as a result it is difficult to get to know them. <br /> <br />     Directed by Zhang Yimou Hero is reportedly the most expensive film in Chinese history, it is also his first attempt at this type of film. Like Crouching Tiger, it is firmly within the `wushu' genre (roughly translated, this means `Heroic Warrior') and serves up several impressively choreographed fight scenes. <br /> <br />     The film is set in China in the third century BCE . The Nameless one (Jet Li) is a provincial prefect who has been summoned to the imperial court of the powerful King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming), in order to tell him how he has defeated the King's three greatest enemies: Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Long Sky (Donnie Yen). As Nameless spins his various yarns in flashback, the King realizes that he may not be telling the truth, so we get several different versions, similar in style to the 1950's Japanese film Rashomon. <br /> <br />     The cinematography, by Christopher Doyle, is incredibly beautiful - frankly, it's the main reason to see the film. The use of color saturation enhances the viewers experience and is used by the film maker to separate plotlines. One breath taking fight scene in particular takes place against a sumptuous backdrop of bright golden leaves that turn to deep red at the scene's climax. In fact, each of the fight scenes are color coded. Although the link between the colors and the scenes themselves is subtle, there is definitely a method to Zhang Yimou madness.  The red scenes correspond to the characters feelings of jealousy and impending doom.  The blue sequences show the anguish of lost love.  Green is used when the Broken Sword and Falling Snow are plotting and attempting to kill the King.  Finally the use of white seems to signify redemption.  Still, who cares when the final product looks this good? <br /> <br />  As Nameless, Jet Li makes a suitably inscrutable hero, whose tales may or may not be hiding an ulterior motive. His fight with the character Sky, in large part takes place in the minds of the two combatants.  Maggie Cheung is also impressive as Flying Snow, particularly during the exciting attack on the calligraphy house where she fends off hundreds, perhaps thousands, of arrows using only her particularly sturdy sleeves. <br />   <br />     Undeniably Hero has several great fight sequences and is profoundly beautiful to look at. The score by composer Tingxiao Hou's is also completely integral to the film. His use of an ancient Chinese stringed instrument called the Gugin (Qin for short) is completely appropriate (and ironic) and  makes the Nameless vs. Sky fight all the more dramatic.  However, the un-engaging structure of the story means that we never really get to know any of the characters on a personal level, they have no depth and as a result, there's no emotional hook to the plot.  That being said, watching the film more than once will make you realize that it doesn't really matter, the film stands on its absolutely stunning cinematography alone.   <br /> <br />     To sum up, Hero is definitely worth watching! The stunning photography, hauntingly beautiful musical score and the sheer spectacle of some of the scenes makes it time well spent. At the very least it serves as an appetizer for Zhang Yimou's follow-up film House of Flying Daggers.
B00005V9HH|5.0|In 1995 the Oscar for Best Picture went to Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  I thought it should have gone to Ron Howard's Apollo 13, but the REAL film that should have won wasn't even nominated; Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, which was nominated for only two Academy Awards (best supporting actor and best original screenplay), which it both won.  Here we have a fast paced, confusing \\"hall-of-mirrors\\" crime-noir/thriller that's loaded with great performances from an ensemble cast, a great score and a whooping of a twist ending that's quite literally jaw-dropping.  This is a film that's truly memorable and deserves to be a classic.<br /><br />The film starts off with what looks like five random criminals being brought in because of a bogus truck robbery.  The five men then plan to get back at the cops by uncovering a corrupt service the police were providing to certain high-paying criminals.  These five \\"usual suspects\\" grow closer to one another, coming together to pull off another job in L.A. which is where things start to get sticky.  They end up getting involved with a sinister crime lord that no one seems to have ever seen or met, named Keyser Soze.  Is Keyser real or is he just a figment of someone's imagination?  The more the jig-saw puzzle pieces seem to be coming together, the more the whole puzzle starts to change and fall apart.<br /><br />You'll think you're on top of it all, but eventually the rug will be pulled out from beneath your feet.  The film does an excellent job of playing with your mind, and at the same time convincing you that you think you know what's going on, but it's not until the final ten minutes that you'll start to be able to pull back and look at the big picture and realize that you've been had.  My hats off to director Bryan Singer (who later went on to bigger fame with 2000's X-Men) and writer Christopher McQuarrie for keeping all of this not only surprising, but fun, and exciting, without ever becoming too complicated or too confusing.  But a lot of praise should also go to the fine cast as well, including Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and a really knockout performance from Kevin Spacey, which earned him an Oscar for the role of Verbal.<br /><br />If you haven't already seen The Usual Suspects by now I highly recommend you go out and buy the special edition DVD right now, don't think about renting it, you'll just end up buying it later any way.  It's a complicated, well crafted and nearly flawlessly written thriller that's exciting and puzzling to watch the first time, and fun to watch again and again.

1558908846|3.0|Let's not bandy words. <br />Casting a star of Stallone's magnitude in a film where the main character is famous, (amongst other things), for never showing his face, was a poor move. He does actually suit the role, but it was inevitable that he would eventually have to take off the helmet. <br />The first twenty minutes or so are fine. Dredd is a commanding presence behind his visor, and Diane Lane brings the humanity to the screen that Dredd obviously lacks. <br />The bikes, uniforms, guns and locale look pretty much perfect. Alot of time and effort was obviously spent making them faithful but functional.  <br />A couple of steps are taken to portraying the facist, horribly unfair world that Dredd enforces. We begin to mix our respect for him with dislike, which is as it should be. Right there, you could be fooled into thinking they were going to pull it off. <br />Then all of that is thrown away as Dredd is whisked through a trial and the film becomes just another random action flick.  <br />Bike chase, comedy sidekick, grunting one liners and before you know it, disbelief is no longer suspended, and you forget you are supposed to be watching Dredd. Instead, you are suddenly watching a bizarre cross between Demolition Man and Deuce Bigalow. <br /> <br />Add to this, the unexplainable way they crammed in as many comic book character cameos as they could, without much due cause. If the intention was to give it a Dredd feel, then why did they mess with them so much? Hammerstein is a robotic hitman, the Angel gang are superb, but just seem to 'show up' with the intention of starting an action sequence, and the only thing Fergie has in common with his origins is the name.  <br />I was half expecting to see Rogue Trooper waiting tables or Johnny Alpha hiding in the background. <br /> <br />It's not all bad. Armand Assante takes the villain role and seems to have fun with it, potraying a volatile temper mixed with homocidal tendancies. That little insane glint in his eyehits the spot quite nicely.  <br />However, even his turn, and the likes of Jurgen Prochnow and Max Von Sydow cannot make this film what it should have been. <br /> <br />The end result is a crude utilisation of very good material to create an average action movie. Dredd has had many good stories in the past, all ripe for screen time, yet none of them were used here. Or, more accurately, five or six of them were haphazardly mashed together for no justifiable reason. <br /> <br />Brave attempt, but chances are, this was not the Dredd you were looking for.
0684800713|3.0|The Sun Also Rises is a book set about 10 years after World War I that is told through Jake, a veteran of the war. He and his rather dysfunctional group of friends live in Paris and decide to take a group trip to Spain. Hemingway's purpose in writing this story was to critique the people of post war society, a.k.a. the Lost Generation.  <br /> Hemingway creates a story that seems stripped to the bare essentials by using a very straightforward writing style. He omits much of the detail that would become monotonous within the plot and provides the reader with characters that are seemingly incapable of receiving sympathy. As for myself, I thought the characters were pathetic because they wasted much of their time drinking, having sex, or longing to have sex. The sexual themes within the novel are very prevalent, because Brett, the main woman present, is indeed very sexually active. The novel lacks having an engaging plot even  though it is written very well.  <br /> Hemingway's main characters, Jake and Brett lack in depth. Jake is almost always found drinking, alone, or pursuing the love of his life, Brett. His pursuance of Brett ,however, is pointless because the war rendered him impotent and thus lacks in Brett's favorite past time. He becomes the most sympathized for, because he nobly sacrifices his own feelings for the betterment of Brett. Brett, on the other hand, is the object of all men's desires. Being beautiful, she gets what she wants and without a bit of emotion, kicks the old to the curb and says hello to the new. Her lack of emotion and inconsiderate nature tend to pull any sense of liking Brett as a character.  <br /> Overall, Hemingway creates a group of friends, and main characters that make you thankful for what you have. You walk away from the novel thinking, \\"I'm so glad that's not me!\\" As a whole, it showcases Hemingway's incredible writing style, but lacks in what makes for a most memorable experience... interesting plot.      <br />
B000EHRVP6|5.0|This film was one of the greatest horror I've seen in a long while. The story is somewhat original, a bunch of horny guys go backpacking through Europe and encounter a strange and dangerous buisness where people are allowed to pay to kill and torture total strangers to satisfy their own sick and demented needs. The group of guys get slowly pulled in one by one into the buisness, meaning they are kiddnapped by the employees as victims for the customers to kill. We then each see the guys get tortured and hurt one by one by sick people who may or may not reveal their interesting back history and their sick motives. This horror flick didnt get grusome until about 40 minutes in, and thats fine with all the events leading up to the end. This film will keep the gore-hounds howling as each kill gets more horrific and disturbing leading up to the end with deaths that made even me, a hard core horror fan, make my stomach twirl. A must see for hard core fans only, definetly not for the squeamish or faint of heart! This great films was behind great minds like Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino which kept the whole film a thrill to the very end!

6305015090|4.0|The mood of melancholia and redemption on Grace is expressed in many different styles. The first track Mojo Pin is a structurally complex slice of tortured prog rock, whilst Grace, the title track, falls into the same stylistic category. Both of these are infused with the intricate and stirring guitar textures of the great axe master Gary Lucas, the co-composer.<br /><br />The minor hit Last Goodbye is a mid-tempo rock ballad with soulful vocals. The style changes for the old song Lilac Wine which gets a soulful interpretation, mournful and tender. The brooding So Real has stunning vocals and awesome guitar parts, whilst Buckley's version of the Leonard Cohen composition Hallelujah is slow and gentle. Although different in style from John Cale's powerful cover, it is on the same level and more appealing than the Cohen original.<br /><br />Lover You Should Have Come Over starts out like a mainstream pop ballad but increases in vocal intensity and is embellished with lovely organ. A form of spiritual catharsis is reached on the devotional Corpus Christi Carol with Buckley in full falsetto mode. This hymn fits in perfectly with the shifting but cohesive modal pattern of the album.<br /><br />Then it's back to loud, guitar-driven rock on Eternal Life. According to the track listing, the album ends with Dream Brother, where the memorable guitar patterns and poetic lyrics create an oneiric quality. My copy of the CD has an eleventh track, another slow and tortured rock ballad about lost love and regret.<br /><br />Most of the songs, especially the rock numbers, have substantial tempo and vocal variations, from a whisper to a soar so to speak. The melodies are not immediately obvious and Grace needs some repeated listening before it can be appreciated for the great and timeless work that it is. Real rating: Four and a half stars.
0415969239|5.0|After FF7 all fans will agree that we needed more ... and the wait was painful! But it was worth the wait. Splendid graphics and the return of our favourite FF characters ... awe inspiring. See it for yourself!all too often unrecognized and underreported, no doubt in a conscious or subconscious effort to avoid challenging the status quo. Even with severe circumcision damage as happened to David many of the mainstream publications reporting his story refrained from mentioning circumcision as the cause of the damage; several only stated, \\"the baby lost his penis in an accident\\" shifting blame from the mutilator to the baby! David's story challenges society to take off its cultural blinkers and look at circumcision for what it is, even if some wish to believe such casualities are acceptable.    David's case is world famous and has been used by many to advance theories of gender. John Money used David's case to advance his theory that gender is imposed after birth. Once David found out about his past and proclaimed his maleness, others have followed with a different tact, using him to suggest that gender is innate. Here in Canada where David's life took place there is another not-so-famous case of another child born male, whose penis was also destroyed in a botched circumcision and raised female. She, now an adult, has been reported in the medical literature as being well adjusted to her female gender role, yet is rarely referred to in the mainstream discourse on gender. Perhaps if her story becomes public she will reveal other subtleties we have yet to understand.    Gender scholars should recognize that we cannot seriously and comprehensively discuss sexuality and gender if the dynamics around genital reducing surgery (circumcision) performed \\"routinely\\" on infants is not included in the scope of this discussion. A society which condones genital mutilation of infants and children and sweeps the casualties under the rug is asking for some serious scrutiny. Professor Butler refers in her footnotes to the chapter on David Reimer, to a videotape on the ethics of sex reassignment of children, yet doesn't mention the impact to society or the ethics of performing \\"routine\\" genital reducing surgery on infant males.     In a latter chapter Professor Butler delightfully acknowledges her sexuality as lesbian and her heritage as Jewish. With these credentials she could turn her brilliant analysis of gender more squarely on the issue of circumcision and perhaps reveal some as yet unknown aspects of the dynamics around this issue. Other scholars have paved the way, notably historian and physician Leonard Glick with his groundbreaking book, \\"Marked in Your Flesh: Circumcision from Ancient Judea to Modern America\\" and Jewish feminist Miriam Pollock in her heartfelt essay, \\"Redefining the Sacred\\" in the book \\"Sexual Mutilations: A Human Tragedy.\\" Also recommended is Ron Goldman's book, \\"Questioning Circumcision: A Jewish Perspective\\" and \\"Male & Female Circumcision: Among Jews, Christians and Muslims, Religious, Medical Social and Legal Debate\\", by Sami Awad Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh. These excellent books are available through Amazon.    \\"Undoing Gender\\" will not be the last book to focus on David Reimer's famous and tragic life. I sincerely hope the next person to write about David will put his case in context and look long, hard and honestly at what happened to him and place blame where it squarely belongs in an effort to keep this from ever happening again. All children have an inherent human right to have their genital integrity protected; their freedom of gender expression and sexual orientation as well.
B000002L68|5.0|What can I say about this album? Only that it is one of the best I've ever listened to and had the pleasure to own. It comes very very close to being almost perfect. And I say almost because I don't really like Computer Blue, but even that song isn't bad. <br /> <br />Here, Prince is at his zenith. And even with subsequent great outputs like Sign O The Times, none of his albums eclipse the greatness of Purple Rain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />ie populaire de la bande dessinée et du dessin animé où il a fait ses premières armes. D'abord dessinateur de BD, puis cartooniste chez Van Beuren (1933-1934), Ub Iwerks (1937) et enfin Warner, il signe de nombreux dessins animés, dont Porky Pig dont il est l'un des créateurs. Tashlin est salué par les spécialistes comme un auteur qui révolutionna le cartoon, à l'instar d'un Tex Avery ou d'un Chuck Jones, par son utilisation de procédés purement cinématographiques. En passant derrière la caméra après la guerre, il fait en quelque sorte le chemin inverse en insufflant aux films de prises de vue réelles l'esprit déjanté des dessins animés. <br /> <br />La Blonde et moi est une comédie assez classique dans le fond, une satire gentillette et inoffensive du showbiz et de la culture populaire des 50's. Tashlin s'amuse avec la fabrication des stars, les petites combines pour faire remarquer son poulain, la possibilité de faire un tube sans une once de talent... mais la critique est loin d'être acerbe. Le film se rapproche plus des comédies à la Cukor (le film est tiré d'un roman de Garson Kanin, l'auteur de Madame porte la culotte et Mademoiselle gagne-tout) que des fables mordantes de Billy Wilder. C'est sur la forme qu'il marque une rupture avec la comédie de l'âge d'or, mariant l'esthétique des sitcoms et du cartoon, sur fond de Rock'n Roll et de ses tubes populaires. I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than potato chips chante Eddie Cochran. Des paroles et des musiques auxquelles le spectateur est encore peu habitué, La Blonde et moi étant l'un des premiers films produit par une Major comportant du Rock'n' Roll. Gene Vincent, Fats Domino, The Platters, Little Richard, The Treniers se partagent l'affiche en autant de saynètes où ils égrainent leurs tubes respectifs, dynamisant, à défaut de dynamiter, le film. Julie London, évoque quant à elle un versant mélancolique et quelque peu sirupeux, avec un Cry Me a River qui hante les virées éthyliques de Tom Ewell. Ces intrusions sont cependant artificiellement plaquées et ne transmettent en aucun cas la fureur et la subversion de cette musique. On ne peut vraiment parler de film Rock'n' Roll, et La Blonde et moi ne demeure au final qu'un documentaire un peu suranné sur cette époque. <br /> <br />L'ouverture est une petite réussite qui porte en elle le programme du film. Tom Ewell se trouve dans un cadre 1.66 en noir et blanc. Promettant au spectateur du grand spectacle, il pousse les côtés du cadre pour atteindre le format du Cinémascope, puis fait appel au \\"Gorgeous, Lifelike Color by De Luxe \\" qui illumine soudainement l'écran de ses couleurs flamboyantes. Il vante ensuite les mérites d'un film où « Culture, refinement, and polite grace of present day music » seront de mise alors que la bande sonore est soudainement saturée par un tube de Rock'n' Roll qui jaillit d'un juke-box. La musique envahit la mécanique et emporte ce grand spectacle classique et de bon goût, dont Tom Ewell exalte les vertus, dans le tourbillon qui s'abat alors sur la culture populaire américaine. Même si le rendez-vous est quelque peu raté, La Blonde et moi demeure une sympathique comédie, témoin des changements radicaux qui vont ébranler les fondations du cinéma hollywoodien qui, en plus de perdre sa mainmise sur le divertissement au profit d'autres médias comme la télévision et la variété, va être considérablement influencé par ceux-ci. <br />
0156027321|5.0|This book was brilliant. It starts off with a really nice story, well told, interesting little tales on the boat. A little over halfway I thought \\"this was a fun, nice story but I didn't know why everyone thought it was *that* brilliant\\".  <br /> <br />Then I read the end. What a shocker. My mouth dropped open, I had to put the book down and scan my mind for everything I just read. The last chapter or so makes you totally rethink everything you have just read since the ship started to sink. Every little tale or story that happened on the boat was really something else - symboloy everywhere and passing sayings take on new meaning. This was the \\"smartest\\" book I've read in a long time. I loved it. <br /> <br />
B00005JOE8|5.0|\\"I know what happened; you were afraid. Who wouldn't be?\\"<br /><br />- V<br /><br />I bring in this qoute from the movie becuase I have to say that this movie totally blows your mind on so many levels. The character known only as \\"V\\" looks like your simple, reptative man in a mask who is either a superhero or a serial killer. I'm sure that we've all seen that song and dance before. This, in turn, makes moviewatchers afriad to go see the movie thinking that it will be unoriginal and just more of the same nonsense formula that everyonE and their cousin has already seen. This is not true.<br /><br />This story, like a good book, evolves on the screen. It unfolds and strikes purpose into the hearts, minds, and spirits of many people who have watched it.<br /><br />When me and my girlfriend first thought of going to see a movie, we both agreed on V for Vendetta in hopes that it would be unique and that it would stand out among all movies made from 1920's--to---2005. And our minds were thankfully melted in a moment of sheer nostalgia grace. This movie has a life of its own! It breathes heart and sheds tears in your soul. The perfect movie of 2006 has finally arrived, knocking on the door in the famous V persona with a rose to greet us all with.<br /><br />After the first viewing, we had to see it again imedietally and . . .were blown away for a second time!<br /><br />This movie, you should know, is not your typical action-movie-superhero story. It has a deeper meaning and an even deeper plotline. The story is mult-layered with symbols, history, operatic, and sometimes funny, scenes all mixed together in a tapestry of hope.<br /><br />The begining, middle, and ending were perfect in every way. Period.<br /><br />I have no gripes or any thing bad to say about it becuase for me it is impossible to do so. It just is.<br /><br />Whether you like the movie or hate it; it did its job in making you think. Since that fateful day, and that 8.00 dollar ticket stubb, me and my girlfriend can not shuddap about how fluidly brillant this gem of a movie is!<br /><br />We've seen it three times in all and, in all probability will go see it a fourth and fifth.<br /><br />And we will both own the dvd and watch it until it breaks from lack of oxygen from never leaving our dvd players!<br /><br />To those who don't like the movie I will say that you are entitled to your opinion but I believe that when you invest your time watching a movie . . . your head should be clear, a clean slate, if you will. All political views, likes, dislikes, and moods should be tossed out the car window on your way to the theater.<br /><br />Take this into perspective: Everyone knows that there are numerous superheroes, correct? There's Batman, Super-man, Spider-man, X-men, many more. Now, when you go to watch any of those seprate movies do you really expect for any of those movies to have character cross-overs or a relation to each other? No. Why? Becuase each of those movies exist in their own little world.<br /><br />V for Vendetta, aside from being the best movie you will ever see in your entire life, has been beaten with remarks and comments that it's attacking political views. No it's not. When you see this movie you must keep an open mind!<br /><br />This is such a good movie, it deserves its own GENRE category!<br /><br />What I liked the most about this film is that it was never corny, but always sly; never stupid, always smart; never overhyped, always reaching expectations; never predictable, always unexpected; never Normal, always original; Characters have scope, they never are two-dimensional.<br /><br />Each frame is like a comic-book panel!<br /><br />This isn't a movie, folks! THIS IS MOVING ART!!!!<br /><br />And so, on an ending note, let it be known that I could compliment this movie in explosive detail.<br /><br />This movie made me remember the fifth of November and my girlfriend as well. And we will always remember the persona of that delictably mischieviously independent masked vigilante \\"V\\".<br /><br />Just know that this movie reaches the goal of being different and memorable.<br /><br />IT OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!!<br /><br />IT'S EVEN TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE MATRIX!!!!!!ersona of that delictably mischieviously independent masked vigilante \\"V\\". <br /> <br />Just know that this movie reaches the goal of being different and memorable. <br /> <br />IT OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!! <br />IT'S EVEN TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE MATRIX!!!!!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  it touched a fiber of my being that resonates days later and probably always will.  i found it visually and emotionally beautiful, all the accolades bestowed upon it richly deserved, and probably more.  i know i will never ever forget ennis' and jack's story.  After seeing it the first time, i had such an emotional catharsis that i have never ever before experienced with any work of art; i basically had to walk away and try to absorb my feelings and the meaning behind the sense of loss i personally felt.  it was well, all i can say is when a medium like film can move a person to tears and to stir up inner emotions so, that is a special thing.  like others, i feel protective of the movie, of these two boys, who could be to any one of us a son, brother, father, friend.       brokeback mountain is like a beautiful piece of music that becomes part of your soul.  i have seen it four times in two days, and my eyes swim with tears every time, even thinking of it. . . driving to work today a song came on, and the movie fresh in my mind, i wept silently in the privacy of my car.  for jack and ennis, for loves that all of us have had at one time or another in life that we lost.    others here have already and more eloquently than i described the movie and its principals.  i don't know if any observations I, a thirtysomething married white female could proffer would mean anything to anyone, so i will keep them brief.  some things that still stand out to me days later:    their reunion scene.  absolutely visceral and real.  the raw emotion and hunger for one another.  it's shocking in its intensity, but anyone who has ever had a love of a lifetime absolutely gets that moment for them, when time stands still and the only people in the world that exist are the two of them.    jack flashing back to their first summer on brokeback at what is to be their last meeting.  as ennis gently cradles him from behind, rocking slowly with him, the look of peace and serenity on jack's face and the longing loving look as ennis rides away, blows me away.  has ever so much been conveyed by two people?  the regret as he comes back to the present and ennis' is driving away, what could have been.  you feel the same sadness and loss for what could have been, so beautifully effectively done.    thank you heath ledger and jake glyenhaal (sp?) and ang lee . . after months of being curious amidst all the buzz, seeing is believing.  i will never ever forget nor fail to be moved profoundly by your movie.  bravo.  i only hope this movie can be a bridge to understanding for ignorance and hatred.  only then can all the pain and despair suffered by the (?) fictional jack and ennis ever be not in vain.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|No, please. This is blood in the name of suspense. This has gone really far. <br /> <br />Let's see. Is it NECESSARY to spoil a not bad plot with so much blood? I was really interested in what was the reason of such a game. I am giving two stars because the thing is original overall. But the interest is soon forgotten as you take more care in find out if some blood has splitted over you. <br /> <br />And this is not the only bad thing. It is very annoying to see Danny Glover in such an awful role. When actors are getting older they must have a decent job. It is simple: look at what \\"Lethal Weapon\\" was. Mel Gibson has really improved his roles. Danny Glover has gone worse... <br /> <br />Even if you have a well-formed stomach this is no good for you... if you have a well-formed brain.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Back in the 90's, when alt rock emerged from its grunge roots, it was fresh, new, and exciting.  Now it has degenerated into a stagnant genre spawning endless talentless garage bands and boring subgenres such as Emo.  However, a few artists are still willing to experiment, and in these the hope of rock and roll remains.  Green Day is one such artist. <br /> <br />Green Day's punk rock roots held no hint of this album.  However, throughout the 90's the band has developed, broadening their horizons with songs such as Good Riddance and Redundant.  Now, studio experimentation and melodic sensibility have made this album a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of the alternative scene. <br /> <br />Song-by-song: <br /> <br />1.  American Idiot - Anthemic in nature, the title track is an excellent statement on post-9/11 America.  Aided by a memorable riff and a catchy chorus, this is easily a highlight. <br /> <br />2.  Jesus of Suburbia - This five-part suite is, in structure, reminiscient of Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", moving through different musical styles.  Of the two such pieces on the album, this one is more cynical and less musical than its counterpart in my opinion, though many argue that this composition is a highlight of the album. <br /> <br />  I.  Jesus of Suburbia - The opening section is obnoxious, and though loaded with witty little lines still feels boring.  A stab at Christianity definitely doesn't help. <br /> <br />  II.  City of the Damned - The best part of the suite.  An excellent melody and lyrics dealing with the hollowness of suburban materialism are present here. <br /> <br />  III.  I Don't Care - The first half of this movement is repetitive, the second tuneless.  The lyrics of the second half do manage to capture the frusteration of the suburban teen, however. <br /> <br />  IV.  Dearly Beloved - A short, retro piece, this song is fun but utterly forgettable. <br /> <br />  V.  Tales from Another Broken Home - A throwback to Green Day'spunk years, this song comes across pretty well.  A calm segment at the ending improves the piece tenfold. <br /> <br />3.  Holiday - Green Day's anti-Iraq piece is a smash hit on the radio.  A powerful chorus and plenty of imagery in the lyrics make this song the anthem it is.  The bridge consists of the lead singer acting as the \\"Representative from California\\" protesting the President.  The ending of this song segues directly into the next track... <br /> <br />4.  Boulevard of Broken Dreams - A superhit, you've probably already heard this song somewhere with the radio on.  A heartfelt song about depression, the lyrics drive the song.  Musically, it is half driving ballad, half punk. <br /> <br />5.  Are We the Waiting? - Extremely underated, the verses possess a haunting quality.  The chorus is a powerful chant, respectively.  Recommended despite being virtually unheard of. <br /> <br />6.  St. Jimmy - A weak track, this song is fast and slick but utterly boring.  The song is basically a rewrite of earlier track \\"Jaded\\", which wasn't very good to begin with. <br /> <br />7.  Give Me Novacaine - A masterpiece.  The song opens with a powerful drumbeat, then unleashes a depressed, lingering melody.  The punk chorus manages to get the singer's emotions across pretty well. <br /> <br />8.  She's A Rebel - An okay song.  It's catchy but not really memorable. <br /> <br />9.  Extraordinary Girl - Another hidden gem.  This ballad describes a relationship between two youth falling apart.  The Eastern sound is exciting after the mostly punk-based tracks.  Lyrics are what set this song apart, though.  J.R.R. Tolkien once said the most beautiful two words in the English language are \\"Cellar Door.\\"  This song has an excellent contender: \\"Heart's Apocalypse.\\" <br /> <br />10.  Letterbomb - An angry song, this is a breakup note with a bite.  Not really notable musically, however. <br /> <br />11.  Wake Me Up When September Ends - Beautiful, just plain beautiful.  This song deals with the death of the lead singer's father, and the pain of the father's death is heartfelt in this song. <br /> <br />12.  Homecoming - Another five-part suite.  This one experiments with more retro sounds combined with 90's punk.  It is easily a highlight of the album, being possibly the strongest song musically. <br /> <br />  I.  The Death of St. Jimmy - The opening riff and successive introduction to this song is an incredible melody, sounding timeless.  The rest of the song is alright, including a hint of British Invasion. <br /> <br />  II.  East 12th Street - More British Invasion vibes, and an extremely memorable tune.  Short but good. <br /> <br />  III.  Nobody Likes You - Simplistic lyrics sang by Green Day's bassist are welcome after hearing the lead singer's voice all album long.  The sound of the song is a slightly psychedelic march. <br /> <br />  IV.  Rock and Roll Girlfriend - Written and sang by the drummer, I am not a big fan of this piece.  It disrupts the continuity of \\"Homecoming\\", and the style is simply bombastic.  Musically, it is arguably a throwback to The Clash. <br /> <br />  V.  We're Coming Home Again - A catchy intro is a chain of musical hooks that never go anywhere.  The main section of this song is a chant reminiscient of the \\"Tear Down the Wall\\" chant from \\"The Trial\\" on Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall.\\" <br /> <br />13.  Whatsername - A good closer, this song is emotional, truly catching the feelings of regret is represents.
B000E33VWW|4.0|I have three words why you should see CAPOTE - Philip Seymour Hoffman. His portrayal of Truman Capote is INDEED Oscar worthy. I bought the DVD because of Hoffman's Oscar win , and also because I have seen the movie \\"In Cold Blood\\" years ago and wanted learn more about the story behind the crime. I thoroughly enjoyed it and even learned a couple of facts I did not know before.  If you don't know anything about the history of the book or the writer, you could become confused with the movie or feel slightly detached. That is why CAPOTE is not meant for general consumption. I guess what I am trying to say is that you should be interested to see the movie, and if you are, you won't be disappointed.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Team America is one of the best movies ever made and I really really love it. It makes me lagh so hard and it's even better than South Park anyway I really enjoyed this movie and I think you have to buy it on DVD it's very funny.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|This is a DVD you should own - no question about it. I was a young boy when the Jessica Lange/Jeff Bridges version came out and absolutely loved that movie. When I bought it on DVD years later I thought it had dated terribly! But this new version by Peter Jackson HAS to be the ultimate King Kong.  This is an adventure movie that is supposed to sweep us away to unexplored fantastical lands and creatures and to stimualte our imaginations and emotions. This it does, and how!  It is not a 100% perfect movie, and you could , if you really wanted to, question a couple of decisions made by Mr Jackson regarding some plotlines. But to sit and squabble about why Jack wasnt wounded when the insects were shot from his body, or why the sunrise came so quickly on Kong's last day in New York (and all the other problems the sourfaced critics pointed out),is to totally miss the point! This is a larger than life story, and thus larger than life things happen! You are supposed to sit back and enjoy this amazing tale. The special effects are breathtaking and Kong looks absolutely real. At the end I sat sobbing like an unbalanced schoolgirl. I will be able to watch this movie lots of times in years to come , which is why this is a perfect \\"buy\\" DVD. I also recommend the second disc with all those very insightful video dairies and a documentary about NY in the 1930's. King Kong is wonderful and magical entertainment!
B00005JO20|1.0|Where do I begin?   This over-the-top heavy handed movie weighs in at a laborious three hours.   It should have been helpfully trimmed to an hour.  They could have saved thirty minutes by cutting out the long loving looks between the ape and the dame.   Wow - that got old. <br /> <br />The dialogue attempts in a few places to be \\"meaningful\\", or maybe even pretentiously \\"philosophical\\", instead it comes off sounding like...well, it just sounds like the drivel it is.   <br /> <br />Now, obviously most people liked this movie.  Which further reaffirms my pessimism about the world's taste.  Not that I am even much for taste.  I like lots of trashy action packed guilty pleasures.  But not this one.  It was just painful to watch.
0671027344|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower was such an interesting and reassuring book. This book focused in on all the parts of different styles of people in high school. In the book Charlie transformed from a friendless and very depressed boy to a unique boy who became very popular and very daring. He had done things he never predicted would happen. He fell in love with a girl, kissed her, had a girlfriend, tried drugs, got drunk, and took adventures he probably never thought could or would happen. He was a great friend to people and was there for them when they needed him. He had no problem ditching whatever he was doing to hang out with his friends. Reading the book really makes  you think of where you stand in high school and who you might be later on in life.
0061020680|4.0|\\"Mort\\" is the fourth book in Terry Pratchett's hugely popular Discworld series. He has gone on to win the Carnegie Medal for \\"The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents\\" and was awarded the OBE in 1998.    Death - tall guy, somewhat underfed, big grin, carries a scythe - appears in more Discworld books than any other character. However, \\"Mort\\" is the first where his appearance in anything other than a very brief cameo - though, admittedly, he remains one of the book's support characters. The book's hero is Mort, the youngest son of a farming family living on the Ramtops. He doesn't quite have the look of a typical hero : although tall and overly-helpful, he's also red-haired, freckled and largely built from knees. His family specialises in distilling wine from reannual grapes - you plant the seed this year and harvest the grape last year. (With the wine, you tend to get the hangover the morning before and need to drink quite a lot to get over  it). Mort's lack of talent in the agricultural field (boom boom !), however, is causing some concern for his father. Hoping someone will hire him as an apprentice, Lezek takes his son to the hiring fair at Sheepridge on Hogswatch Night. Although Mort is the last one hired, he is probably the most aptly named apprentice - given that his new boss is Death himself.     Despite Mort's initial discomfort with the position - he doesn't have to be dead himself and the bones look is entirely optional - he decides to accept the position. Death also makes it clear he doesn't do the killing himself - that's up to assassins and soldiers, for example - he just takes over when people die. (He has, however, been known to murder a curry). Life (if that's what you call it) with Death is very strange. His home is designed, unsurprisingly, in varying shades of dark and is much bigger on the inside than on the outside. He also has a daughter called Ysabell and a butler called Albert - both human and not just skeletons - and a horse called Binky. All are also very much alive. The problems start when Mort starts shadowing his new boss at work - specifically, when they are due to escort King Olerv of Sto-Lat into the afterlife. The King has just been assassinated by his ambitious cousin the Duke of Sto-Helit. Unfortunately, Princess Keli is next on the Duke's hitlist and Mort's youthful hormones aren't too happy about this. As soon as Mort starts interfering, other questions start coming to mind - like where does Death get a daughter and why does he need an apprentice ?     Despite his profession, Death is one of the funniest characters on the Discworld. Although it's the first book to give him a starring role, it may prove a slight advantage to have read one or two of the other books. (Rincewind is a particular hobby of Death's so \\"The Colour of Magic\\" and \\"The Light Fantastic may be worth looking into). Very highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me start out by saying, up until about a month ago, I was totally unaware that such a show existed. Now, it's pretty much at the forefront of my mind, basically all the time. So while discovering this amazing series will bring you infinite pleasure, it will probably get in the way of your life, just a little. It's just so damn good. <br /> <br />The characters are just so interesting and complex, and their interactions with each other are definitely a driving force. Whedon's combination of the old west, and a futuristic world mean that almost any scenario is possible, and the crew of Serenity has a way of getting into some very interesting ones.  <br /> <br />The humor beats that of almost any show I've ever seen. With all the characters being so different, there is such a great blend of dry, sarcastic, laugh out loud, and how-could-anyone-possibly-be-that-STUPID humor, the latter being courtesy of the resident merc, Jayne Cobb. <br /> <br />I can't see how anyone wouldn't love this show. Don't be thrown off by the genre. My sci-fi knowledge doesn't go past star Wars, and my familiarity with westerns is basically nothing, but the writing, acting and adventure of this show make it so easy to fall into. You'll really be taken to another world if you jump into the 'verse and you won't come back for all the strawberries in it.
B000301YY8|4.0|I think the songs on this album are, although they are good, are to widely played and played to much, such as 'your beautiful', which i hear everywhere i go.Apart from that this was a beautiful record with so much charecter. You could really feel him singing the song, and i got right in there.<br />If you want my advice, defiantly buy this record.<br /><br />Sam Worrall<br />rating:4 stars!
B000000W6X|5.0|Eleven years have pass since Massive Attack came out with this album, and when i listen to it,  still sounding as fresh  and new as that then it?s an amazing work , with the colaboration of the also amaizing Craig Armstrong, Tracy Thorn and Tricky . <br /> <br /> I have always thought that melancholy it?s the ?nice?part of being sad, well this is the feeling in this CD . With sublime work on the piano made by Armstrong and the angel voice of Tracy Thorn (Everything But The Girl) this three guys made a classic album that is going to last forever , full of inovative sounds, vocals and deep feeling. While others reviewers think of it as a dark album (which really is , i?m not going to desagree) i think of it more as a beawtiful and melancholic album but no matter how we feel it, this is a most have!!!!  <br /> <br />No matter what kind of music you like this is one of those albums that have something for everybody unless you like Paulina Rubio <br /> <br />If this album would not have included ?Lite My Fire? this could have been call PERFECTION  instead of PROTECTION
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This movie captures all the awe and fantastic depictions from the novel. This movie is a masterpiece itself...almost word for word exactly the same as the infamous novel. I recommend this movie to anyway who appreciates children's movies, Roald Dahl, Kids movies and so on. I still find it amazing that in the nut-room scenes in the movie, that those were real squirrels.
0671004107|5.0|Contact is grand, it is epic, and it is vast in it's hypotheses and plotline. However, it is also one of the most touching and personable books you will ever read.<br /><br />I agree with others who have said that the twists and turns in the plot are fantastic. No doubt. But my favorite thing about this book is Ellie's character - her tenacity, her passion, and her undaunted *faith* while yet an athiest and a scientist. Sagan develops an array of interesting characters, with different backgrounds and belief systems, who respond to the first-contact experience in unique ways. As much as Contact is a story about first-contact with aliens, it is as much or even moreso a pondering about humanity, our strengths and weaknesses, and the delicate differences through which we strive to find common ground.<br /><br />You should know that there are a few significant differences between the book and the movie (I did like the movie very much by the way, and felt Jodie Foster did a superb job as Ellie). The following are \\"minor spoilers\\". In other words, they are subtle hints at what you may have missed if you only saw the movie, but, I have not outright told you what is in the book either:<br /><br />1) Palmer Joss's character looks quite different in the book, and has a different background, than the hot-bodied heart-throb portrayed in the movie by McConaughey (McConaughey did well with the part written for him, in my opinion). Also Ellie does not have a physically intimate relationship with Joss, although she does with more than one other character in the book.<br /><br />2) Ellie's mom and stepdad have key roles, while her deceased dad does not appear as often.<br /><br />3) Ellie is not the only person who meets the Caretakers (aliens).<br /><br />4) During the first contact with the alien (\\"her dad\\"), the conversation is much longer and more detailed. The alien shares paragraphs of information about the outside universe, what they have discovered, an intriguing discussion on pi and the secrets this number holds, and what they feel the future holds for other worlds in the galaxy. This was a significant difference from the movie, though I can see why Zemeckis needed to shorten some of it due to its extensiveness.<br /><br />5) The book has two fantastic twists at the end which the movie did not include. The first one revolves around something Ellie learned about pi during her conversation with the alien. I was surprised the movie did not include it, as it was such a creative and masterful conclusion. The second has to do with Ellie's stepdad, who does not appear in the movie.<br /><br />There are other differences but these were the most significant ones for me.<br /><br />If you are on the lookout for books with a similar theme/feel, try Jack McDevitt's \\"The Engines of God\\" and \\"The Hercules Text\\", especially the latter.<br /><br />And on a side note - Hey Nick, How about a SEQUEL?n pi and the secrets this number holds, and what they feel the future holds for other worlds in the galaxy.

6305428271|3.0|The book Dangerous Minds by LouAnne Johnson was a little interesting but at the same time confusing. It's about a woman who was a former marine that turns into a teacher to help troubled kids. I thought the book was ok, but it jumps around a lot so I would prefer the movie. I would recommend this book to high school students, not college students. In addition I give this book 3 stars.  <br /> <br />                             By: Kayla Robinson <br /> <br />
B0000630BT|5.0|I wanted to hear Judas Priest which wasn't in my collection yet. I went to the stores and saw the mighty PAINKILLER...!!<br /><br />It wasn't a wrong buy, I needed to get used to the ripping killer-voice, but now I love it!!! Painkiller, the heavy speed rock album by Judas Priest certainly is not a mistake. Every single song is great. I'm sure that the gods behind Painkiller were pretty satisfied after producing this album. Every song is catchy and fast, except A Touch Of Evil, this one isn't fast, but it is very catchy, I didn't need to listen a long time to this album, or I named this song, which is one of a kind on this album, to my favorite of the compact disc. I think I can prepare myself for more of this killer-music!!!<br /><br />I recommend this album to all metal-fans, especially when you need a heavy, relaxing killer-album, with ripping killer-vocals!!!<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!!!!!!!!\m/dem Zwerg der Unterwelt die Fähigkeit zu verleihen, seinen Kiefer auszuhängen um sich durch das Erdreich beißen zu können, wie ein Regenwurm und wer hätte ihn dann auch noch mit Flatulenzen beglückt bzw. bestraft, als kleine Nebenwirkung dieser Gabe? <br /> <br />Meine Meinung: <br />Hut ab vor diesem unbedingten Muss. <br />Nicht nur für Technikfreaks, sondern auch für jeden empfehlenswert, der unvorhersehbare Wendungen und atemberaubende Geschichten mag!
B000A2H812|5.0|This album is a musical expression of the best sex you've ever had.   <br /> <br />The length of the CD is great, the way it plays end to end is a fabulous ride, and the fact that Gogol Bordello consists of real musicians shines through.  I don't know much about producing, but it seems like the focus was on the band and not so much on the vocals.  And really, it's lovely that way.  Eugene Hutz's unpolished snarl and Euro. beatboxing pulls you in immediately.  As the album plays, there's actually a full range of vocal ability from maniacal howling to a coherent musical rant - might I say almost pleading? - about what's wrong with people today.   <br /> <br />The music is a wildly passionate conglomeration of Gypsy/klezmer (they're nearly the same), reggae, and dub all spun together into punk rock.   <br /> <br />Also, never does it ever get whiny.  If you come from a European immigrant background, the tone is all too familiar.  A little tongue-in-cheek sarcasm, commentary, attention to history, oblique references, and free and open manipulation of the English language.  It's beautiful.  For me, it was like my background and upbringing made it onto a CD that took the Old World and made it new again. <br /> <br />Like I said.  The best sex.  Intimate, maniacally passionate, personal, universal, and the timing is perfect.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I recieved the product on time and it was in really good condition. I really appreciate getting the product in such good condition and having it so fast I was a little worried about that.

1400062071|4.0|This is a novel that won't disappoint its readers.  The prose is clear, the plot is believable and the characters ring true.  At the end of this book, I felt as if the main character were someone I liked very much and had known for a long time.  His faith and fortitude in the face of very dire circumstances were evident, and made his vulnerability all the more touching.  I felt a sense of peace at its conclusion.  Thank you, Ms. Strout, for a remarkably excellent book.
B000003NA3|5.0|Over the past couple days I listened to this for the first time in years. I listened to the Crescent album a few months ago and that was the first and only Coltrane (in terms of one of his own albums) I'd listened to in years. No real reason why I hadn't listened to him hardly at all for so long, I just hadn't.<br /><br />It turns out I had forgotten how great a set this is. I always loved it, and I remembered loving it, but it's really been knocking me out these past 2 days. A ton has been written about Coltrane himself, and much more will be written in the future. Too little is said about the rest of the band. I think you could not care for Coltrane himself all that much and still love this music. Recorded on 11/1/61, 11/2/61, 11/3/61 and 11/5/61, the bands here (mainly McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, Reggie Workman, Elvin Jones and Eric Dolphy) are fantastic. When a Coltrane solo ends, there is no letdown. This is some of McCoy's finest playing ever... much better than on other peoples' Blue Note albums. Garrison, Workman and Jones get it going on in a major way here. Really that is what this set is about for me more than anything... rhythm. It's impossible for me to sit still during this stuff. A churning, pumping cyclone of sound, that's what this band is.<br /><br />The Indias and Miles' Modes alone would be enough to counterbalance this album even if the rest of the stuff were only worthy of one star, which is not the case. And of course this makes me miss Eric Dolphy, as usual. I'm not sure I'll ever stop wondering what could have been. =(
B00009V7P8|5.0|Every now and again, you stumble across an artist that knocks you sideways. With beautiful melodies and thought-provoking lyrics, this album certainly hits the spot. If you like radio-friendly sing-along pop, this album is not for you. But,if you are a real music junkie looking for a continuous hit, this certainly delivers...This album is timeless and just gets better with every listen.
1590385217|5.0|Everyone I know who likes Feeder, was turned onto them by this album.<br /><br />If you mention Feeder then it is this album that most people will think of.<br /><br />It's a great album, a little poppier than the rest of their stuff but still a definate classic. It marks the end of and era. Unkowingly this was the last album with drummer Jon Lee. It is not just a great album, it is a great collecetion of songs. Besides the obvious \\"Seven Days in the Sun\\" and \\"Buck Rogers\\", \\"Piece by Piece\\" and \\"Oxygen\\" are both fantastic songs.<br /><br />If you haven't got this album yet, then why not?<br /><br />It's packed full of fantastically, brilliant songs. This'll get you into a good band if nothing else will!
B00005QXDD|4.0|Jack Black and Kyle Gass... What can I say - hilarious!    The first but hopefully not the last Tenacious D album is fully deserving of the four stars I have awarded it.     Every song on this C.D (bar a few) is unbearably funny - I've had friends at school almost in tears laughing at Drive-Thru, it's that good!    I've rated the songs on this album, and have given each song a short description...enjoy.      1. Kielbasa: 9/10: Great start to the album. Not the funniest song on the album, but very smart lyrics.    2. One Note Song: 8/10: The first skit Tenacious D put on offer. Jack creates a song consisting of only one note, and then has a go at Kyle about it.     3. Tribute: 10/10: The D's main claim to fame. Incredible song paying tribute to 'The greatest song in the world.' Almost everyone I know has heard of this song.    4. Wonderboy: 9/10: I always thought that Jack and Kyle were a bit different... know we find out that they're super-heroes! This funny song, tells the story about how the D came to be.    5. Hard F******: 6/10: Rude skit, not really very funny, leads into...    6. F*** Her Gently: 7/10: Pretty catchy song, about what women what during sx.    7. Explosivo: 8/10: Cool Song about...I have no idea! Jack doesn't seem to know either.    8. Dio: 8/10: Funny song about Ronny James Dio - apparently Jack and Kyle want to take over for him. (After they lock him away in an old person's home)    9. Inward Singing: 9/10: This skit is a definite contestant for the most profanity EVER recorded. Jack explodes big time during this track. Very funny, the turning point in the album.     10. Kyle Quit The Band: 8/10: Another load of swearing in this track, but it definitely adds to the humour of the song, very funny intro.    11. The Road: 8/10: Jack sings about his experiences on 'the road'. Really upbeat song, catchy.    12. C*** Pushups: 8/10: Very funny, rude skit. Completely unbelievable...or is it?    13. Lee: 8/10: I have no idea why I like this song; it pretty much just repeats the word 'Lee' over and over and over and over....    14. Friendship Test: 8/10: Funny skit, Jack tells K.G that he loves him.    15. Friendship: 10/10: Hilarious song, really funny, about what true friendship is.    16. Karate Schnitzel: 9/10: One of the funniest skits on the C.D. WARNING: NEVER STEAL JACK BLACKS FOOD!    17. Karate: 10/10: Very funny lead on from Karate Schnitzel, with some quirky lyrics.    18. Rock Your Socks: 10/10: Definitely my fav. track on this album, very catchy, very clever lyrics, very funny.    19. Drive-Thru: 9/10: The D's final skit - and their funniest. Don't you just hate those drive-through folks?    20. Double Team: 9/10: Funny love song, very weird lyrics.    21. City Hall: 10/10: The D's Best song...ever! This hilarious song covers the rise and fall of two leaders, K.G and Jack Black, an epic ending to an awesome C.D.    22. Malibu Nights (Hidden track): 7/10: Follow on from one note song. Evens out the score - weird, weird lyrics.      This album is not for the faint of heart. Lots of profanity is used throughout the C.D, but fittingly. This C.D is for anyone with a sense of humour - and no one wants to be known as humourless do they? So go buy this C.D, you won't regret it.    Note: If you've read this, and you find it even mildly interesting, or learn something - however small, please take a few seconds of your time to vote this as being a helpful review.    Thanks, ThE mEtAl MaN
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I don't know if words describe the genius of this release, but I'll try anyway. THIS IS THE BEST THRASH/SPEED METAL ALBUM IN EXISTANCE!! Yes, that's a bold statement, but its true. Forget about Master of Puppets, that's not even the best Metallica album(Ride the Lightning is better). Reign in Blood is awesome, but those solos don't even come near the ones on here. Let's not even talk about Lamb of God or BLS. This is the possibly the best album ever, but definitely the best since Stained Class. <br /> <br />1. Holy Wars/The Punishment Due 10/10 The strong opener that goes from the Crusades to the Punisher with amazing solos from Friedman and Mustaine including a mellodic acoustic interlude.  <br />2. Hangar 18 25/10 BEST SONG EVER! Solo after Solo. Unbelievable <br />3. Take No Prisoners 10/10 short but sweet.  <br />4. Five Magics 10/10 Solos. I like the lyrics <br />5. Poison was the Cure 10/10 nothing special compared everything else, it just rocks unmercifully that's all. <br />6. Lucretia 10/10 sort of weird, but the solos. <br />7. Tornado of Souls 10/10 I hated this song the first time I heard it, but now it is one of my favorite songs. Friedman does an unbelievable solo. <br />8. Dawn Patrol 5/10 a good bass intro to Rust in Peace, but the voiceover is obnoxious. <br />9. Rust in Peace... Polaris 10/10 a fitting way to end the album, just rocks. <br /> <br />Megadeth in my oppinion is the best thrash band and American metal band. Dave Mustaine is the single best thrash songwriter and is equal to Kirk Hammett in guitar playing. That being said Marty Friedman is better than both of them, which is why Megadeth is better; Mustaine and Friedman are better than Hetfield and Hammett. If you don't like Megadeth than you really don't appreciate Metallica either. Why are you still reading get this now.
0743454537|2.0|This book capitalizes on a socially important subject without contributing any intrinsic value. Witness: the product placements, ineffective use of \\"in their voice\\" due to inadequate character development, and the cheap-shot ending. The intention appears to me as simple mental manipulation of the masses to equate the importance of this book with the importance of the singular question on which the story is based. Tabloid-style sensationalism always finds a popular audience; selfish capitalism prevails over social responsibility in the short term. However, if a genuine, constructive exchange of ideas regarding this human social dilemma is generated as a result of this book then perhaps it is worth the paper on which it is printed after all.
B00005R62K|5.0|This album is fantastic and shows that Pink is most certainly alive and kicking ass!<br /><br />Unless you've been on Planet No-Music you'll have heard 'Stupid Girls' and I have to say that this song just cracks me up.  The video is brilliant but just listening to the lyrics makes me smile as our girl Pink pokes fun at the paparazzi blondes who are famous for just being famous! The song caused a bit of a stir when it was released but I challenge anyone to not smile while listening to it.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a mixture of R&B, pop and rock with some sentimental musings in the form of 'Dear Mr President'.  It just shows what a talent Pink has that she can mix so many styles on one album and make it work.  Her vocal range on this album is fantastic.<br /><br />There isn't one song on here that isn't brilliant but in the favourite stakes 'Who Knew', 'U + Ur Hand', 'Stupid Girls' and 'Dear Mr President' are my favourites.  One things for sure......Pink sure ain't dead!

I saw my then 17 year old daughter read it and all other books written by James Frey.<br /><br />I don't want to comment on the content of the  book which means different things to different people.I loved his writings.<br /><br />Writing a book drunk or sober is an amazing task. I don't look to author's drunk or sober to be my God. I take what I feel is important to me from a book. I take it at face value. Their judgements are not mine. I only read and process and leave their truth to them and mine to me.<br /><br />I am not a critic of his life. I am not his judge. I do believe people who read his book (those with whom I spoke -got something  great from it.)<br /><br />I support James Frey as a human and as a writer. I will continue to read his books.
1571892257|4.0|I had a life.<br /><br />Now all I have is a mission<br /><br />The year is 2415; it has been seven generations since the industrial plague whipped out 99% of the people. The few remaining survivors are all huddled into one city with walls protecting them from what ever is outside. It is an ideal city of Bregna ran by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and a council. And as with any such city there will always be rebels that thinks something is wrong with lack of freedom and mysterious disappearances. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) belongs to such an organization. Her mission as the most ept agent is to dispatch the so called benevolent ruler. Can she do this or will circumstances and chance encounters change the situation?<br /><br />The film does not boost of any thing really extraordinary except maybe an exceptionally rich architectural back drop. Shot mostly in Berlin we see many popular places that for some reason they though would not be that familiar to the audience. Evidently they must not know how popular Berlin is, especially key locations. The original location on their wish list was Brasilia because of its 1050's futuristic look; however that proved to be economically unfeasible. See if you recognize Sans Souci, Potsdam built in 1745 by Frederick the Great, one of the world best know orangeries.<br /><br />Although this movie had nothing extraordinary it is a perfect example of the genre and will hold your attention as you anticipate where they are going with the story. Only someone that anticipates that it will stick to the animated series may be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD rendering adds some background commentaries that make rewatching the film more enjoyable.ill indeed see that the principles are the same.
B000BRBVO6|5.0|This is a must-see for Orwell/1984 fans. It is as faithful a adaptation of the novel as it is possible to achieve IMHO. Largely shot on or around the dates mentioned in the novel. John Hurt, Suzanna Hamilton and Richard Burton in his final film appearance are just great. Brings the dense air and thick grime of the oppressed world of Ociana to life without being pushy or preachy. If Orwell had lived as long it is MHO that he would have approved this film adaptation.
0553801503|5.0|I understand the frustrations with this book.  Martin ends his last installment with multiple intense cliffhangers, waits over five years to release the next one, and then does little to resolve any of those incredibly interesting plotlines.  He has a cast of dozens of major characters and countless minor ones, all essential to the plot and who are difficult enough to keep track as it is, but then after five years adds multiple new characters.  It would have been sort of like George Lucas releasing another Star Wars movie between \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" that focused on a set of mostly minor characters in a side story completely unrelated to the main plot.  As good a a movie that may have been, we would have been pretty unhappy to have to wait another few years to learn the fates of Han, Luke, Vader and the rest of the characters we'd come to know and love.  So yeah, I understand after five years why people would complain about a 700 page book that does little to advance the main plot or to address the fates of most of the major players. <br /> <br />But the thing is, Martin is such a fine writer, and his universe so compelling, that I don't mind being distracted by these things.  That's not to say that I would be happy reading everything he wrote, no matter how trivial and meandering it might be.   However, the situations and characters in this book are still relevant to the overall happenings of the series, and there ARE more resolutions and involvement of major characters than a lot of reviews here and elsewhere would have you believe.  Martin fleshes out people and places that we know little about, or about whom we wanted to know more, and also manages to advance the storylines of a few characters already well-developed from previous books.  Cersei and Jaime play very significant roles, and Sansa and Arya get a few chapters too.  This is a very political series, and I enjoyed learning about places like Dorne and the Iron Islands.  Even if they aren't necessarily essential to the main storyline and even if there stories could have been conveyed offscreen, I still found them very interesting and felt that they added even more depth to an already rich world.  And while this book may not have as many battles or significant events as past books in the series, Martin maintains the same quality of storytelling and writing; I can't think of a time that I was ever bored or lost. <br /> <br />And speaking of being lost, I'd strongly recommend one of several websites that have chapter summaries and glossaries to refresh your memory.  There are simply too many characters, places and historical events to keep track of without a guide.  I found towerofthehand.com to be the most thorough of these websites.  Just be careful to avoid spoilers. <br /> <br />So hopefully we'll see book 5 very soon, and it will address all of the characters and plot lines left out of A Feast for Crows.  I don't think that Martin has lost control of his story yet, but there is always that potential in a lenthy, multi-volume fantasy series.  As much as I enjoy these books, I do want there to be an eventual resolution.  But in the meantime, this was a solid entry in the series, and it leaves me wanting even more from Martin.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I avoided seeing this movie in the theater for a couple of reasons: First off I am tired of the current crop of pretty-boy actors who trade on their looks to mask a lack of talent. I had assumed that this movie, having Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in the leads, would be the same. Boy was I wrong! I was seriously impressed with both these actors; they deserved all the accolades they received. I hope that they will choose well in the future because these are talented actors who deserve good roles in good movies. <br /> <br />The second reason was the constant, endless hype. Let's be honest: this was not \\"a movie that had to be made\\" nor was this \\"a story that had to be told\\". In point of fact this story already had been told, though not nearly as well, by \\"Another Country\\" and Merchant-Ivory's \\"Maurice\\". That being said, what this is is an extraordinarily GOOD movie. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there are so many groups with agendas regarding this movie; you would think it was 3 or 4 different movies just judging from what people say. This is not an allegory on \\"Gay Marriage\\" or the \\"Gay Lifestyle\\", or anything else, good or bad. This is simply an extremely well written, photographed and acted love story were the two lovers happen to be men. <br /> <br />I'll skip over the story, which I'm sure everyone should know by now, and explain why, in my opinion; this is such a great movie: <br />Firstly is the subtlety of the movie. There is nothing slapping you in the face, and you have to watch the movie several times to see all the little subplots. The dialog is extremely well written, and again, you have to pay close attention because you WILL miss things that will become important later in the movie. Secondly are the characters. I found it fascinating how the character of Enis is not particularly likeable, but is far and away the most sympathetic character. Conversely, the character of Jack is extremely likeable, but I didn't find him terribly sympathetic. Although Ihave to admit, that for me, Jacks \\"likeability factor\\" went down several notches in the last scene with Jack and Enis. I think what he said to him was extremely cruel. But, since it was obviously not calculated cruelty, you still end up liking him. Much has been made of the two female supporting actresses. I think they did a fine job, but they were secondary at best to the Jack and Enis characters and found neither of them likeable in the least.  <br /> <br />Finally what I've heard called the \\"ewww factor\\" (ewww two guys having sex, ewww two guys in love). Guys, I guarantee you'll have \\"seen\\" more the last time you were at the gym. The \\"love scene\\" was, in my opinion more of a rape scene for all that they both knew what they were doing, and was very tastefully done. If tastefully is the word, but I think you get my drift. Aside from that, as far as any overt affection between Enis and Jack goes, if you've ever given your best buddy a big ol' bear hug and maybe a peck on the cheek after a few beers, you're not gonna see anything that will shock you. And if you've never done that, bud you have issues and should NOT watch this movie! <br /> <br />To sum up, this is a movie you have to make up your own mind about, but you really should watch. I found it a truly moving movie, beautifully photographed, extremely well written and with truly outstanding performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. But fair warning, as the last scene fades out, you're going to feel an overwhelming need to give someone you love a hug! <br />
B00026WU64|5.0|After careful consideration this was the Dylan album I chose to buy.  And I do not regret buying it nor should anyone.  This is a masterpiece.  Not many people can make an album that holds you from track 1 to the end.  The Beatles, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan all can keep you sittin' on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br />Great timeless songs on here are of course Blowin' In the Wind a song that breaks generation barriers.  The lovely Girl From North Country, Bob Dylans Bob Dylan's Blues, Masters of War, and many more. <br /> <br />Without a doubt a must have in any Dylan collection.  Your not a Dylan fan if you don't have this.

B00005JKZV|5.0|The Fellowship of the Ring has been cut down and scattered. As Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas go forth on a rescue mission to save Merry and Pippin, now prisoners of the bloodthirsty Uruk-Hai, the burden of the One Ring grows heavier on little Frodo Baggins. His only comfort and support on his long journey to Mordor is the steadfast faith and loyalty of his best friend, Samwise Gamgee. When the Hobbit pair fall under attack by a former ring-bearer, the creature Gollum, they soon enlist his aid as a guide on their quest. But can he be trusted? For 500 years, the ring poisoned Gollum's mind. Now, Gollum is a broken soul. He struggles between a desire for redemption and a lust for \\"the precious.\\" Frodo seeks to reform the creature in order to gain hope for his own struggle with the ring, but Sam despises the pitiful Gollum and cannot understand Frodo's need to show mercy. Meanwhile, our other two Hobbit heroes, Merry and Pippin, seize an opportunity for freedom and soon find themselves consorting with an entirely new type of creature, the towering Ents, who could provide great help against the evil wizard Saruman and his army. Following their own course, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas soon find themselves reunited with an old friend and helping defend a king's stronghold, Helm's Deep, from Sauron's deadly forces. The culmination is a thrilling battle with little hope of victory, and yet it is only the beginning of Sauron's war on mankind and the freedom of Middle Earth!<br /><br />Based on the renowned books by author J. R. R. Tolkien, \\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" is the second installment of a three-part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least! Director Peter Jackson, surprisingly coming from a no-budget splatter film background, brings the world of Middle Earth to fantastic and astonishing reality! Intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other. It is difficult to single out performances here, for every cast member is perfection. However, note must be made that this second, darker, scarier film in the saga introduces the entirely digital creature Gollum as a major part of the principal cast brought stunningly to life with amazingly realistic computer effects and the wonderful talent of Andy Serkis. This installment also introduces one of the few female characters in the trilogy, the fierce but lovely Eowyn, played with great warmth and believability by Miranda Otto. In addition to the outstanding cast, the visual effects are flawless, the music is inspiring, and the settings are incomparable. The great attention to detail results in a medieval world that, fantastic as it is, seems 100% real. The creatures are amazing, the battles are astounding and intense, and at the heart of it all is a message to never give up, whether you are defending an entire kingdom or one single soul. This is filmmaking at its finest. Can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience? Yes and no. The films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy, though there is never a dull moment, but they are unquestionably all one single story. They must ALL be seen consecutively and in order (though you don't have to watch them all in one day). This Widescreen, 2-disc edition of the DVD presents the film as it was released in theaters, with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include: 2 featurettes on the making of the film, 8 short web-featurettes, theatrical trailers and TV spots, a haunting music video by Emiliana Torrini, a charming short film called \\"The Long and the Short of It\\" by Sean Astin, a featurette on the making of \\"The Long and the Short of It,\\" a preview of the third film in the trilogy (Return of the King) and its video game, and, believe it or not, a preview of the extended edition of the Two Towers DVD. That's right, some time after the release of this theatrical edition, extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on DVD.Those must be REALLY long, and they probably have some great extras too; maybe the audio commentaries or production art we don't get here. Regardless, even Peter Jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the \\"preferred versions.\\" So, make your choice. You might even feel like owning both versions. Any way you go, you can't lose. Fantastic films!<br /><br />In the past, there have been animated versions of the Lord of the Rings and the preceding tale by J. R. R. Tolkien, \\"The Hobbit.\\" You may want to discover these for yourself. I can't wholeheartedly recommend them, as I haven't seen them since childhood, and I recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least. Still, it's been a long time, but don't expect them to come anywhere near these versions. Also recommended for \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fans: The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, The Last Unicorn, The Princess Bride, The Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, Merlin, the Harry Potter series, the Star Wars saga (still my favorite film series, but I'm a longtime fan), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Willow, Clash of the Titans, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Pirates of the Caribbean, Army of Darkness, Fantasia, and I'm SURE I'm forgetting many more.

0671027360|5.0|Never got into the show when it was originally broadcast, then one wet Sunday rented Serenity, which was enjoyable and intriguing enough for me to impulse order Firefly, sight unseen, a few weeks later when it appeared discounted on Amazon.<br /><br />Absolutely no regrets - It's an amusing, quirky show with plenty of action & real chemistry between the cast.  This makes it watchable first time round, and went through all 14 episodes over two nights.  It also a real pleasure to play the odd episode again on a quiet night, and rediscover the endearing crew & great dialogue - This is the only other show apart from Family Guy that I've re-watched with any frequency.  Not to gush, but it does become fun to revisit their \\"'verse\\". You will still laugh/smirk at the wit & jokes second or third time around.  You easily end up caring for the crew, and characterisation is pretty brilliant.<br /><br />The melding of sci-fi and wild west themes works pretty well, especially as JW never takes either genre too seriously, poking fun at both at every other opportunity. It does make it less \\"believable\\" (if such a term can be using for imaginings regarding life 500 years hence...), but that just makes you focus on the characters and the storyline - the sfx are very much just a backdrop. JW's surmising that Chinese/Asiatic culture will predominate is a red herring, but a touch of genius non-the-less.<br /><br />In summary, a top-notch series, worth getting and keeping. Hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Basically what Gibson tries to say is that since Christ suffered a lot on the cross you better accept him or you'll suffer in hell, like Christ suffered on the cross, for eternity.  <br /> <br />See I refuse to worship a God or a Christ primarily because of my libertarian (sort of in Ayn Rand style) objections. The thought of worshiping anyone: king, master, government, god, whatever, utterly disgusts me. And I don't appreciate Gibson threatening me with his movie.  <br /> <br />I don't think the movies is as much anti-Semitic as it's anti-intellectual, anti-humanistic and anti-libertarian. The movie is an emotional garbage for ignorant fundamentalist masses ! Anyone who has any intellectual dignity should be repulsed and disgusted by its simplistic message !
B00005JMUA|5.0|The duo is complete and I am satisfied.  Tarantino's second instalment in the Kill Bill saga was all to similar, yet all to unique compared to the first.  The basic execution and cinematic style is completely the same, yet Kill Bill, Volume 2 has an entirely different feel from its predecessor.  I believe the second film has surpassed the first in every way.  The acting is better (since the characters are actually familiar and relatable), the fight scenes are funnnier and more entertaining, and the finale is quite impressive.  Quentin Tarantino is an incredible adition to the film industry and I hope that audiences continue to give this unique and important voice their undivided attention for years to come!

B00005JMEW|5.0|Tarantino, being the master that he is, is (lucky for us) incapable of taking anything to seriously.  In Kill Bill volume one he has once again proven his quality as a film maker and has entertained us all.  Blood is spewn from all angles and orifaces and, in true Quentin Tarantino style, the good guy somehow manages to kill 88 people at one time.  As bizzare and unrealistic as Kill Bill was, one must understand that beneath the blood, the drama, and the action is the real heart of this picture: comedy.  The movie is simply a comedy and one must take it for all that it is.  I loved every frame and recommend it for anyone with a sense of humor (and a strong stomach).

When completed in 1838, Cedar Grove was no match for what we might imagine today was the archetypal Southern plantation - Berkeley Plantation on the James River, say, or the even larger and more splendid old estates of the Deep South. But in truth, this smaller estate and home were more typical of the real Southern plantation than were the better-known properties.    Still, Cedar Grove was a substantial construction for its day - three stories, with 14'6\\" ceilings on the first floor and a center hall that was 48 feet long and 15 feet wide. It was filled with remarkable craftsmanship, largely the work of slaves - especially a master bricklayer remembered by the name \\"George Washington,\\" and a master carpenter known only as \\"Old Jim.\\"     \\"Ole Marster\\" had two sons and a daughter who were born in quick succession after he and his second wife moved in to the new house. But those children had barely passed their youth when life changed forever. In October of 1860 \\"Ole Marster\\" was writing to his boys, who had gone off to college, with words of alarm over \\"the distracted condition of the country.\\" Within months the sons were in uniform - and soon after that one was in a prison camp, the other sent home with serious wounds. Lewis' book reproduces a number of interesting war-era family letters, tells of a brief visit by Yankee raiders who finished off the wine cellar and smashed up the furniture for firewood - and then gives us the cold, spare fact that \\"Ole Marster\\" died the year after the war ended.    Upon his death the property was divided among family members, but most kept up their life on and around the old property - including many of the former slaves, now free but earning their living on the old homestead. Lewis remembers a boyhood filled with family gatherings at the old place, days spent in the fields and woods, and occasional excursions to town to sell a rabbit or two andpick up a little cash. His chapter on \\"A Country Boy's Life\\" is a good recounting of that era. Two engaging chapters on wild turkeys, and the art of hunting them, show us that Lewis retained the habits and pleasures of his youth well into his old age.    In 1877 another family took over the old mansion on the strength of a disputed promissory note with \\"Ole Marster's\\" signature on it, and Cedar Grove began a half century of decline - until, in 1929, John Taylor Lewis Jr. came up with enough money to buy it back. Even then, finances were so tight and the house was in such bad shape that it took him until 1950 to begin the restoration needed before he and his wife could move in. That January they had no running water and no central heating, but soon the house was restored to a liveable condition.    In 1992, two years after Lewis' death, Jim Kinnear and his wife Mary were on the lookout for a \\"project\\" to undertake after his retirement the following year. They found Cedar Grove, and the story from here on is covered in Kinnear's epilogue to the 2006 edition.     Jim and Mary threw themselves into an enormous restoration task that covered not only the main house but also the extensive, neglected lands around it. There were trips to Monticello to study architectural details and pick up older varieties of apple trees and other plants. The interior woodwork was painstakingly restored. Guest cottages were modernized. The slave cemetery - yes, they found one - was restored to dignity. Paths and ponds and stands were laid out for hunts, and for long walks with the dogs. Guests poured into the house - from the surrounding countryside, and from the Kinnears' network of friends around the world.     Kinnear's epilogue turns a loving eye on the passion and good humor that his Mary brought to the twin tasks of restoring the property, and treating guests like royalty. She found a couple of mules (one of them better behaved than the other) to pull guests around on carts. There wasa 1928 Steinway for gatherings after dinner, and costumes for after-hours theatrical exercises. She talked her Connecticut Yankee husband into learning to play \\"Dixie\\" for Virginia guests. For some reason she decided to turn old clay tennis courts into a field for croquet, at which she became an expert. Mary invented fig ice cream - then patrolled the guest cabins to tease those who were making off with more than their share. Readers will find themselves praying that the obvious joy Jim gets from telling us these stories about his wife somehow helps to ease the hurt from Mary's death in November of 2002.    Under the protection of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Cedar Grove will now endure. Future generations will be inspired by the house. And perhaps also by the land around it -  where John Taylor Lewis Jr., hid in wait for his turkeys, and where Mary Kinnear taught herself to play croquet.
B000055Y0X|5.0|The movie is legendary, so I won't bother with the obvious!  I will however, take the opportunity to test my memory in \\"public\\" with perhaps my favorite sequence in the entire film... <br /> <br />\\"Hello?  Uh, hello, Dimitri?  Listen, can't hear too well.  Do you suppose you could turn the music down just a little?  Ah, that's better.  Yes, I can hear you now, Dimitri.  Clear and plain and coming through fine.

Now then, Dimitri, you know, how, we've always talked about the possibility...of something going wrong with the bomb.  The bomb, Dimitri.  The hydrogen bomb.  Well, what happened was, one of our base commanders, he went; well, he went a little funny in the head.  You know, just a little...funny; and he went and did a silly thing.  Well, I'll tell you what he did; he ordered our planes...to attack your country.  Well, let me finish, Dimitri.  Let me finish, Dimitri.  Listen, how do you think I feel about this?  Can you imagine how I feel about this, Dimitri?  Why do you think I'm calling you?  Just to say hello?  Oh course I like to speak to you!  Of course I like to say hello!  Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.  I'm just calling to tell you something terrible...it's a friendly call, of course it's a friendly call.  Listen, if it wasn't friendly...you probably wouldn't have gotten it.\\" <br /> <br />Whew!  I could go on and on, but it gets exhausting!

Here is the complete list:<br /><br />Question<br />How Is It (We Are Here)<br />And The Tide Rushes In<br />Don't You Feel Small<br />Tortoise & The Hare<br />It's Up To You<br />Minstrel's Song<br />Dawning Is The Day<br />Melancholy Man<br />Balance<br /><br />Extra songs:<br />Mike's Number One (Bonus Track)<br />Question (Alternate Version) (Bonus Track)<br />Minstrel's Song (Original Mix) (Bonus Track)<br />It's Up To You (Original Mix) (Bonus Track)<br />Don't You Feel Small (Original Mix) (Bonus Track)<br />Dawning Is The Day (Full Original Mix) (Bonus Track)<br /><br />No previous Moody Blues album has contained such rare BBC sessions, outtakes and alternate mixes. The differences are subtle but many include backup vocals, new instruments and a different pacing to the songs.  One needs no other recording of this classic album. The box is half plastic and half cardboard which might not last as long as a regular CD package. However, the liner package notes are exhaustive with many new pictures and a complete history.<br /><br />(Note: This is an SACD mix made from the original quadraphonic tapes. The extra songs are the original remastered quadraphonic tapes - not SACD).
B00005LANG|4.0|I am a huge Bob Marley fan and always have been for about 20 years now, but listening to Exodus doesn't give me the same thrill as of the over albums such as Uprising, Natty Dread and Survival. <br />Yes this album was called the most important album of the century by Time Magazine and holds many classics, but I feel that maybe Coming In From The Cold or Wake Up And Live should had more credit than it did. <br />An excellant album though but I would consider Uprising or Survival to your starting path of Bob Marley.
B000BC8STM|3.0|Was happy to see that this concert of Cher's made it to DVD finally. However, for whatever reason this is the TV version of the concert and NOT the version that was released on VHS in 1992. All of the songs from the VHS are here, but as bonus tracks.  <br /> Overall this is a great concert, Cher looked incredible back then and this is my favorite era for Cher. The concert was filmed during her Heart Of Stone tour in 1990 and unlike her later tours, the show is actually pretty simple. At that time she wasn't doing any of her previous hits, only focusing on her current material and cover songs.  <br /> The best songs from this concert are her covers of Jimmy Webb's \\"Many Rivers To Cross\\" and my favorite Springsteen's \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\".  <br /> She looks and sounds great. The only flaw is the show is not the complete VHS show. But the DVD does have commentary from Cher on a few of the bonus features. And the bonus features are pretty cool, in particular the multi angle feature that lets you switch from the Mirage show, the rehearsal and from another tour date.  <br /> Cher at her peak.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|There comes a time in the life-span of every rock group when the contemplation over their own intent comes into question. For the Strokes, that time is now. Their initial release, Is This It? harkened back to musical yesteryear, revolving around an aesthetic that proceeded them nearly two decades. However, after failing to expound upon the apparent density of talent displayed upon that release, opting to emulate those footsteps once more with Room on Fire, they were found themselves faced with the inevitability of either toiling away in obscurity, rendering their careers impotent of importance by refraining from both chord and lyrical progression, or to embrace change with open arms.  <br /> <br />On First Impressions of Earth they do neither, resulting in an album which despite it's quality, feels lock-step. From the outset, \\"I'll Try Anything Once\\" sets the tone for the entire release. Initially, the lack of deviation from their previous work is astounding, as the deficiency of distortion in the lyrics and the expansion of chords is evident, but only hint at the mere integration of a few new colors to the band's musical palette. \\"Juicebox,\\" the lead single is permeated by this feeling as well, with the hook eerily akin to a litany of stanzas on their previous work, showing a slightly altered harmonic difference between then and now, yet the complete overhaul expected is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br />Sadly, throughout First Impressions of Earth, many of the vignettes culminate in the same refrain: minimal discrepancy between the erstwhile and the current, eliciting a feel of wear, imbuing the melodies with a dispensable, unnecessary feel. The instances where surprises arise due to exploration are few and far between with \\"Red Light,\\" which is a amalgamation of \\"12:15\\"'s (from Room on Fire) synthesized chords and the new-found dedication to clarity both lyrically and sonically, and the churning, antiquated beauty of the ballad \\"Ask Me Anything,\\" the only two songs to invoke this impression. <br /> <br />Overall the dearth of creativity saddles this album with the inert sense of ennui -- the aftermath of meandering tendencies overcoming ambition. The songs themselves are nowhere near the level of dissatisfaction, but the sense of irrelevance saturates nearly every chord and lyric, rendering the chorus from \\"Ask Me Anything\\" -- \\"I've got nothing to say,\\" sung what seems innumerably -- as not only appropriate, but quite possibly their newly adopted motto. <br />
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I have some of Coldplay's studio albums, and frankly, they don't hold a candle to the live performances.  There's no zing zang zip to the studio stuff.  It's kind of pedantic, unenergetic, bland, and...well...plain boring.  Live 2003 is the polar opposite.  I can only conclude that the studio work is necessary for them to write and flesh out their new material, but it's in live performance that the songs actually breath...where the magic happens.  This band, more than any other I've come across, needs to be heard in its live incarnation.  Coldplay sucks up the energy from that audience, concentrates it, changes it, then spits it back out at them gloriously.  I'm going to upset some people, but I'd say avoid the studio albums and go for their live discs and some concert tickets.
B000BLI4PG|4.0|Want to see an entire generation of grown men act like children? Play the opening theme from 1979's \\"The Warriors.\\" Barry de Vorzon's concoction of swirly synths, smattering of electric piano, and steady tempo rolling along like a subway, is a sure thing to get fists in the air, and shouts of enthusiasm.  <br />         A big part of The Warriors appeal is the soundtrack, which was reissued recently. It`s equal parts exhilarating, funky, poignant and cheesy. Just like the movie.  <br />                 The cover of 60's classic \\"Nowhere to Run\\" is like Michael McDonald doing the \\"Hot Lunch Jam\\" from \\"Fame.\\" The catchy salsa disco \\"In Havana\\" has 70's strings, and bizarrely enough, Chevy Chase on backing vocals. Then again, he was Steely Dan's original drummer. Just thought I'd also point out this was co-produced by a man named Artie Ripp.  <br />         \\"Echoes In My Mind\\" by Mandrill could be Sly Stone leading Earth, Wind, and Fire. This contains so much funky, nocturnal Summer spirit, you can practically smell sweat and see neon lights flashing.  <br />         Hearing guitar genius Joe Walsh's \\"In the City,\\" automatically makes you think of them walking victorious but downcast on the beach into the Coney Island morning sun. This is a slightly more discofied version than the one he did with the Eagles. But it's just as melodic, affecting and still has that killer slide guitar.  <br />                 \\"Love Is a Fire\\" by Genya Raven sounds like every 80's Kiss song, especially the line \\"Beginning to feel my temperature rise.\\" Cheese icon Desmond Child  bellows \\"Last of an Ancient Breed,\\" which has that melodramatic Meat Loaf quality, even if he was probably aiming for Bruce. Although the lyric \\"Ride the devil's steed\\" is more Tenacious D than Springsteen. Perhaps the ultimate song for caucasian men who like to high-five and wear doo-rags.  <br />                Who would've thought a movie about gangs during a turbulent time in N.Y.C. (and that inspired riots in some cities) could provoke such warm feelings of innocence and a nagging sense of nostalgia? Is the current state of the world that f@#$#ked up, or are we yearning for our childhood? Either way, can you dig it?
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I'm one the few people who liked Cabin Fever but, there are scenes in that movie that still don't make sense to me. even though I loved Cabin Fever I think Hostel was a much better story (from Eli Roth) because I didn't see maney gaps in the movie (scenes that didn't make sense). If you didn't care for Cabin fever because of the gore and T&A. You will not like this movie because there is a lot more in this movie. Cabin Fever was (more fast paced). This one is slower moving but, the story is darker and more messed up then Cabin Fever. It will make you think twice about forign (sp) babes and backpacking. Do me a favor... If you have seen the movie and didn't like it don't give it a bad reveiw on here and say it's because of the gore and T&A. Thats what the Horror Genre is. Watch the Friday the 13th series (it's the same way). It's just makes for good horror. thats the way it was. Thats the way it is and thats the way it will always be. So don't cry about it. HOSTEL IS AN AWSOME FLICK. I RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES BLOOD AND GUTS. Eli's next two movies will be (in order) HOSTEL 2  and his fourth film will be Stephen King's CELL. Anyway I hope you enjoy Hostel. I did!!!
0446677450|4.0|Overall I liked this book and I admire Robert Kiyosaki personally and for what he is trying to achieve with this and subsequent books. This book is an excellent introduction to important wealth-building concepts and is highly motivational for investors of any experience level. For people looking for specific investment selection advice, this is not the best book available, although he has written several more germane books subsequent to this one.<br /><br />I liked the general layout and premises of the book, but I admit that while I understood his simple cash flow diagrams, I did not find them particularly useful or enlightening.<br /><br /> Kiyosaki makes several excellent specific points that I think are particularly noteworthy. On page 48 he makes an excellent point about the majority of business school graduates when he discusses \\"bean counters.\\" I have nothing against business school graduates, but he is right on the money that when they take over a business the frequent result is financial ruin due to their frequently simplistic attitudes about short-term cost control. He makes a related point on page 138 in a discussion of union representation, asserting that the more specialized and non-transferable your skills are, the more you need union representation. I find this to be interesting coming from a very pro-capitalist point of view, but these arguments are both very well delineated and people concerned with labor relations will find this an interesting book.<br /><br />The book is very quickly read, and I found the principles very interesting and refreshing. Although I found some of the \\"rich dad's\\" educational techniques unconventional and bizarre (and occasionally disturbing), I think the overall lessons to be learned from this book are manifold.<br /><br />I give the book four stars overall: I think Kiyosaki's (and co-author Lechter's) heart is in the right place, I would have liked more detailed investment selection advice, and a bit less promotion of his extremely expensive \\"Cashflow\\" game. Having said that, the last two chapters are great for motivation, and the important principles espoused more than justify the purchase price of this book. I plan on buying further books in the series that are more specifically on investment strategies outlined here in concept.otion of his extremely expensive \\"Cashflow\\" game.

B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" is not only one of my favorite Floyd albums, but one of the best progressive rock albums of all time. Even though I am sure that some fans might disagree with me, and maybe say \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"any album with Sid Barret\\" I have to say that this \\"Animals\\" takes the cake. It seemed like Pink Floyd was taken a few steps backwards after releasing \\"Wish you were Here\\" which I think is over-rated, a good, solid album, but no way near the efforts of the albums before it. Then when \\"Animals\\" was released, they gave us one of the best journies into progressive rock, second probely only to Rush's \\"2112\\" I love every song on this album, and this album, even though released in 1977, was light years ahead of its time, which of course is no surpise since Floyd, Yes, and Rush were all taken Rock music to the next level. Its a shame that we dont have more modern bands thats give us a treat like Floyd did, even though I highly reccomend Dream Theater for those that are looking for great modern Progressive rock. ANIMALS is still standing the test of time, even in 2006, and I am sure it will for another 50 years..ENJOY
B000EHRVP6|5.0|This book is a very comprehensive view of antique perfumes, mostly French, but very informative if you have little knowledge of perfume manufacturers as I do.  My only complaint is not enough illustrations, and find the index very confusing, but even so I pick this book almost on a daily basis to check out a bottle I have seen. Highly recommended as reference bookfive, count em, five commentary tracks by various combinations of director and producer, executive producer, cinematographer, and monologue. Roth says there are so many simply because he has so much to say about the film. These features make the movie an excellent purchase. <br /> <br />The primary weakness is the fact that the actual scenes of mayhem are almost, but not quite as good as the famous, original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. They will certainly not satisfy the masochists among the audience who watch `King Kong' primarily for the scene where the big ape meets the hapless blond. It is much more of a truer representative of sadism from the sadist's point of view (read the original `Justine' to see what I mean) rather than the sanitized sadism seen from the point of view of the masochist / submissive. The victims in this movie are NOT having fun. <br /> <br />The commentaries give a lot of information on the kinds of decisions that go into casting movies, such as the decision not to cast Rutger Hauer, for example, in the role as the lead heavy, if only because Hauer has played that role so many times before, that his appearance would give away a lot of the surprise. <br /> <br />There are a lot of minor plot twists that border on the brilliant in their originality. The most interesting is the role-played by the band of Bratislava street urchins. Fagin would have been proud of these lads. <br /> <br />A very chilling and entertaining DVD. <br />
0140293469|5.0|This is a story about love, friendship, sex, rejection, getting older and knowing what you want in life.  <br />It is full of humor and some poignant moments too. Fans of Nick Hornby (like me) will love this book. Anyone who hasn't read anything by him before read this one first - you'll be hooked. (Suggestion for a perfect partner - Steve Horsfall (You Are Here), i.e. captures all of the above) <br />
B000059T00|5.0|This album is dynamite.  For anyone who likes Cream (or good music for that matter), and appreciates what Clapton and Baker could do together, this is an album to have.   <br /> <br />The album begins with \\"Had to Cry Today\\" - a lengthy testament to Clapton's overlaying of harmonies.  This is followed by \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" - SUPERB.  The mood of this song is seldom (or better yet, never) replicated today; with its story-telling guitar, identifiable, yet gripping, lyrics, and simple, yet very groovable, high-hat beat - the ambiance is undeniable. <br /> <br />The bigness continues with \\"Well All Right\\" - a guitar, piano, and bass, never sounded so big (though it is a cover).  It sounds like there's so much going on in this song - but not to the extent that the groove or melody suffers one bit. <br /> <br />I am listening to the album as I write this, and could go on about the reflective \\"Presence of the Lord\\", the vocally stunning \\"Sea of Joy\\", or the jazzy \\"Do What You Like\\" - which, I should note, includes a ten-minute Ginger special.   <br /> <br />To end, if you like the cast, you will definitely appreciate the sum of their abilities: Clapton chugs and harmonizes, Baker pounds with undeniable vigour, Grech pounds and scales with Bruce-like precision, and Steve Winwood asserts himself as one of rock's truly magical voices.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hostel starts out like any other horror movie does, with a couple of kids looking to have fun. In that respect, it ends the same way most horror flicks do, with a lot of blood and terror.<br /><br />  The movie follows a couple of college kids who are backpacking across Europe with a somewhat off-kilter Finnish man as there self-appointed tour guide.<br /><br />  The first thing I noticed about this film though was my instant dislike towards the main male characters. To sum it up, the two guys are pretty much meat heads. They are only interested in having sex, doing drugs and, errr...well, having sex. It's basically because of the trio's sex-starved minds that leads them straight to Slovakia, where someone mentions you can pretty much \\"TAKE\\" whatever woman you want and do \\"WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THEM\\" when you get them. Which, to me, was somewhat unnerving and sexist. It was hard to actually care for these characters and understand there minds when they were such pigs! They could have thrown in a character who WASN'T a homophobic, dumb, sex-obsessed jock to give viewers a little more of a likeability factor...but, that's just my opinion!!<br /><br />  Anyways, I can't give much away, but the movie takes a horrific turn when one of the \\"meatheads\\" goes missing (Actually, The NICER meathead bites the dust first).<br /><br />  Lots of extreme gore and brutality ensue in what I would consider to be one of the most DISGUSTING films I have ever seen. I am NOT a connoisseur of horror or gore, but this movie really made me flinch and feel sick. I couldn't help but feel dirty after I finished watching this movie!<br /><br />  There are scenes where fingers are chopped off with excruciatingly gory results, achiles tendons are sliced open and left gaping to the viewers mortified sight, eye balls are pulled out and left hanging on a screaming victims head only to be snipped off with a scissor (the snipped off eye ball oozing cream colored puss was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen), a guy is gagged with one of those S&M type ball-gag devices and he continually vomits and chokes on it, Throats are slit, body parts are chopped...hell, there is even a scene where a gang of what appears to be kids under the ages of 10 stomp in and crush two \\"bad guys\\" heads.<br /><br />  I have to admit that when the torture scenes occur you DO feel terrified and scared for the main characters regardless of there immature behaviors, after all, they ARE human beings, and the actors portrayed the fear and trauma of what happens incredibly well. There were truly believable performances by these young actors and I was in awe of some of the dark and shocking moments.<br /><br />  You can also sense Quentin Tarrentino's prescence in this film. His influences are scattered throughout it in various small details. I found the revenge plot points towards the ending COMPLETELY Tarrentino. They almost seemed KILL BILL in there delivery.<br /><br />  This movie is NOT for the squeamish. I was definetly disturbed and creeped out by Hostel. I would have given it more stars If the characters were a little more relatable (to ME personally-but we can't win um' all!) and a lot less horny.<br /><br />  Be careful...if you have a weak stomach or can't handle blood and gore, you might want to pass this up! If you think you can handle the gore, try this movie out...it will definetly hook you and keep your eyes glued to the screen (before it proceeds to tear them out!)one of those S&M type ball-gag devices and he continually vomits and chokes on it, Throats are slit, body parts are chopped...hell, there is even a scene where a gang of what appears to be kids under the ages of 10 stomp in and crush two \\"bad guys\\" heads.

1590594576|5.0|«Out of Time» brille par l'&eacute;l&eacute;gance de ses compositions, la beaut&eacute; de l'agencement des instruments (magistrale utilisation de la guitare &eacute;lectrique). La voix de Michael Stipe et de ses camarades vous entoure d'une douceur revigorante. Oui, les m&eacute;lodies sont d&eacute;pouill&eacute;es, et c'est justement ce qui place ce disque un peu hors du temps, en surplomb, tel le «Bridge over Troubled Water». «Near wild heaven» est aussi bon que «Shiny happy people» (La vraie d&eacute;couverte de cet album). Mais on est en droit d'en penser autant de la po&eacute;sie sublime de «Belong» ou du subtil «Endgame». Et puis il y a «Losing my religion», ind&eacute;boulonnable. Il n'y a rien &agrave; mettre de côt&eacute;. Ce disque est un prototype de «best of ». Seul petit reproche, «Me in Honey» est un titre un peu faible de refermer une parenth&egrave;se pop aussi exquise.
B000EGCITG|5.0|So Pinks back!!! After giving us two great albums 'Cant Take Me Home' and 'Missundazstood' and the honestly quite rubbish 'Try This' she comes storming back and setting the charts alight with this rocking album! I bought it the day it came out and just cant stop playing it! <br /> <br />1-Stupid Girls- a full out attack on 'celebs' and 'wannabes' who do anything to keep their 15mins of fame. The video is so funny and i love that she attacks the stereotypical ideas of what you have to be to be successful! 4/5 <br /> <br />2-Who Knew- a song written about losing friends through death or just  losing contact. A really beautiful song with amazing lyrics which rocks and anyone whos lost a friend will totally get it. 5/5 <br /> <br />3-Long Way To Happy-not one of my instant faves but it grew on me and now i cant get it off! This song rocks and talks of complications of relationships and just having to get on with life! 5/5 <br /> <br />4-Nobody Knows-a slight ballad. It shows Pink can tackle fast rock and slow pop. She has an amazing voice with this record shows off. 4/5 <br /> <br />5-Dear Mr.President(ft.Indigo Girls)-i love this song and that Pinks not afraid to stand up for what she believes in. I think it speaks for itself. 5/5 <br /> <br />6-Im Not Dead-title track which to be honest i didnt love at first but its growing on me. 4/5 <br /> <br />7-Cuz I Can-i love this song its just so much fun. It kind of sounds like Pink is bragging about everything shes got that we dont but i think if you then listen to 'I Got Money Now' you see its just a light hearted fun song. 5/5 <br /> <br />8-Leave Me Alone(Im Lonely)-this is my absolute favourite song! Its so true of relationships and i think alot of people can relate to it! I adore this song! 5/5 <br /> <br />9-U + Ur Hand-great song. A real rock chick song for when your with your girlfriend about to hit the clubs! About just having fun! 5/5 <br /> <br />10-Runaway-good song about how sometimes things happen in life thatyou just dont understand why! 5/5 <br /> <br />11-The One That Got Away-this song sounds like the were in the studio just jammin'. Its not anything special but its good. 4/5 <br /> <br />12-I Got Money Now-i think this songs attacks the idea that the average person has, that money makes everything perfect and makes you happy. While it probably doesnt, its easy for someone like Pink with loads of money to say money isnt everything. 5/5 <br /> <br />13-Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self-i think everyone whos kind of over the teenage stage can look back and relate to this. This is a great song 5/5 <br /> <br />14-Fingers-the beat intro to this song is HOT! Its kinda of a club dance song which isnt your normal thing form Pink! This song is Hot! I loved it instantly! Since Pink and Carey hardly get to spend that much time together se your imagination to what its about ;) 5/5 <br /> <br />15-Centerfold-another amazing song that i loved from the start. Fast paced and good. 5/5 <br /> <br />16-*Bonus*I Have Seen The Rain(ft. James T.Moore)-i like that before this track comes on Pink talks a little about how it came about i think thats a really cute touch. The song is obviously really personal and means alot to Pink. Its cute 4/5 <br /> <br />I adore this album and dont understand how anyone could rate it less than 5 stars! Its one of my favourite albums of all time! <br /> <br />
B000E6UK5K|4.0|THE BAND: David Gilmour (vocals, electric & acoustic guitars, bass, percussion, piano, Hammond organ, harmonica, sax), an assortment of different players - most notably and consistent - Phil Manzanera (keyboards), Andy Newmark (drums), Guy Pratt (bass). Listen for backing vocal contributions from David Crosby and Graham Nash on the title track.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2006) 10 songs clocking in at just under 52 minutes. The CD case is actually like a small book... 18-pages containing of lyrics, pictures, song credits, musician credits, and thank you's. The CD itself is in the back of the book stuck to a piece of black spongy rubber... never seen it done this way before... and I hope I don't have problems with it down the road. The booklet itself is cleverly done and like nothing else in my collection of almost 1500 discs. Label - Sony/Columbia.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Gilmour's solo albums are far and few between. His first being in 1978, the 2nd being in the miod 80's... and now decades later \\"On An Island\\". Outside of a few trademark guitar solo's, this is nothing like his music days with Pink Floyd. Gilmour's career somehow reminds me of Sting (when he left the Police) - when he went on to give us a very different flavor of music other than what we expected. \\"On An Island\\" is absolutely mellow. Gilmour's voice is soothing. The orchestral arrangements that accompany some of the songs are wonderful. Songs are soft, sleepy, bluesy... and some simply go nowhere. However, it IS beautiful music. It's music for a rainy sleepy afternoon, or background music for a low key event. The most upbeat tune here is \\"Take A Breath\\", but it's perhaps my least favorite track on the disc due to the chanting lyrics. \\"On An Island\\" has 3 instrumentals... and all sound like modern-day Gilmour soundscapes that he and Roger Watters could have pulled from \\"The Wall\\". When first listening to \\"This Heaven\\", I thought of Eric Clapton's \\"Unplugged\\" cd - this could have been one of EC's tunes. And listening to track 8 - \\"Smile\\" - this could have been one of Paul McCartney's tunes from the mid 70's. Gilmour is in great form here - making the album that HE wanted to make. \\"On An Island\\" is a good album - just don't go into your first listen with grandious Pink Floyd expectations.k 8 - \\"Smile\\" - this could have been one of Paul McCartney's tunes from the mid 70's.

B00006V9A0|5.0|As you can read on many Amazon reviews Nirvana has many detractors as well as many obssesed fans, while Nirvana is not as great as the Beatles, they were great and had an effect in the music industry that only a few bands have had in history, they are closer to the Sex Pistols than the Beatles, only better, because of the strong musicianship of its three members, Dave Grohl is still the best drummer in the planet (just listen to NIN's With Teeth). Personally I wasn't into Nirvana at their heyday 91-94, but since then I've recognized their importance in music and appreciate their many great songs. <br />This is an excellent compilation and if you need more tracks, well, buy the albums, just three, Bleach, Nevermind and In Utero.
B000006E1N|5.0|I bought this album when it was released in 1995 and though I didn't care much at all for what they did after this release, it still captures the essence of Britpop and revives memories of the Blur v. Oasis debates of the time.<br /><br />Songs like the title track 'Morning glory', 'Wonderwall' and 'Champagne supernova' still sound great as do most of the other tracks. Oasis' best track 'Acquiesce' should have been included on this album, but can be found on the Masterplan CD, a reasonable collection of B-sides and EP tracks.glance. Unfortunately, Beauty is seated with a jealous white slummer for the evening who has apparently bought his services.

B000AMWIVM|3.0|great suprise ending, but lacks scares and is sort of boring like in my opinion <br />
B000E6UK5K|2.0|To be quite honest,I just gave \\"On An Island\\" cd a second tortorous listen, to all ten songs, and tried in earnest to keep an open mind to each song individually, and good folks oh let me tell you! by the time the sixth song was playing thru my bose head phones,I was in the land of nap,by then blissfully spared by the ether of sleep, of any further boredom from david and pink polly`s latest creation,where do I begin? Lyrics are...Pink Polly`s equivalent of Airsupply`s love songs, if Airsupply ever attempted to sound Floyd-like,I must admit that David Gilmour`s <br />singing does save some songs from sucking even more, and the proof of that is TAKE A DEEP BREATH,all others just suck in various degrees, I will challenge anyone to put on the headphones <br />and listen to Roger Waters AMUSED TO DEATH entire cd and then listen to David Gilmour`s ON AN ISLAND -his best work as he was quoted saying-and then rate this crap five stars as some reviews <br />have rate it, I gave it two stars,one for Polly, and one for david. <br />
B0000AMRJC|3.0|a while ago everyone told me this was such an amazing movie and that if i wanna become a director one day i should watch it and i watched it thinkn it would be amazing and i was let down, i mean great acting and stuff yea but its not much differnt then any other mobster movie and people over exaggurate that its great so much, in my opinion pulp fiction blows this out of the water
B000ASSDVA|5.0|Stevie Wonder (born Steveland Judkins Morris) began singing in a choir with his mother and siblings at a very early age at the Whitestone Baptist Church, which lay in his hometown of Saginaw.<br /><br />By the age of 10, Stevie Wonder was a child prodigy. He proved a master on the piano, harmonica and drums and was adept at poetry and song-writing. Stevie was soon recommended by John Glover (who he was extensivley working with at the time) to Ronnie White, then a member of the fantastic, Smokey Robinson And The Miracles, who were signed to Detroits, Tamla Motown Records, founded by Berry Gordy who was instantly astounded by this child genius.<br /><br />Dubbed Little Stevie Wonder in his early career, he was rapidly signed to Motown Records, home to some of the most important names in the history of black music including Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye. It was clear from an early age that Stevie Wonder indeed was a deeply gifted singer/songwriter and muscian.<br /><br />Fingertips, released in 1963, proved an exhilirating masterpiece. Fingertips was virtually a harmonica instrumental but its just so totally infectious and caught onto the public like a magnet. Fingertips quickly catapulted to the top of the U.S charts and became the first in a long line of classics.<br /><br />It was clearly his Motown work that remained some of his most popular and compelling output. The vibrant, Uptight (Everything's Alright) was a highly infectious affair as was the more sparse production of Yesterme-Yesteryou-Yesterday. The rolling undertones of playful funk on the classic, Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours) were three classics that perharps were pure examples of how Stevie Wonder gradually adapted to more Pop styles where his work still vastly contained elements of traditional black rhythm and blues but was able to cross boundaries and break down many racial barriers (much in the way Diana Ross had). Though commercial in each of the tracks content, they all still firmly retained that earthy, soulful style, owing much to Stevies credible and unique vocal style.<br /><br />Stevie proved to be a masterful lyric writer and conveyed an effortless flair for ballads such as on the passionate, timeless, My Cherie Amour (written with Henry Cosby) and the more subtle and profound, A Place In The Sun.<br /><br />Like Marvin gaye, his work steadily progressed from the formulaic sounds of Motown to more creative, artistic and indepth material, releasing a string of quality studio albums throughout the 1970's. The startling Superstition was a sharp, nifty, funky number where Stevies voice effectivley cuts through the stark musical arrangements. He delivered a more anthemic message on the compelling, Higher Ground.<br /><br />The awesome, Living For The City, was an exciting, severn-minute epic which echoed the restrictions and perils of ghetto life. Much of his work steered more into profound political and social issues that perfectly captured contemporary times and deservedly gained wide acknowledgement from critics.<br /><br />Like Diana Ross (a close friend of the divas and he'd also written the dazzling compostion, Too Shy To Say for her 1977 studio album, Baby It's Me) his work eventually settled into the more Adult-Contemporary market that occupied the lower reaches of the charts yet fully remained an A-list novelty act. Such saccharine numbers like I Just Called To Say I Love You, may have become big cross-atlantic hits but this type of material lacks the dynamic of some of his earlier work.<br /><br />Even so, Stevie Wonder continues to this day to enjoy a large and loyal following. This being the definitive collection of Stevie Wonders work makes it essential to any serious Soul/R&B/Motown collection.hat earthy, soulful style, owing much to Stevies credible and unique vocal style.<br /><br />Stevie proved to be a masterful lyric writer and conveyed an effortless flair for ballads such as on the passionate, timeless, My Cherie Amour (written with Henry Cosby) and the more subtle and profound, A Place In The Sun.<br /><br />Like Marvin gaye, his work steadily progressed from the formulaic sounds of Motown to more creative, artistic and indepth material, releasing a string of quality studio albums throughout the 1970's.

B000002IVF|5.0|This is an album easily misunderstood. The songs are varying from delicate (Helpless Heart) to solid rock (Coverage). The composers who helped him with this songs are truly interested in a then comeback for David Crosby. The openingtrack Hero with Phil Collins is a statement. Every song is a jewel. Everything on this album is a demonstration of craftmenship. Musicians, vocals and production. The lead is his voice from bronze sounding as a churchbell; \\"Listen To Me\\", \\"Listen To Me\\", \\"Listen To Me\\". <br />I suggest: Do That!! <br />

B000EHRVP6|1.0|The way I see it:  If you're going to make movie like this, either go all the way with it or don't bother.  While there are a couple of scenes that are no doubt twisted and brutal, the overall tone of the movie seems pretty confused.  The basic premise has lots of potential to thoroughly disturb, if pulled off well.  Alas, this movie struck me as a cop-out.  It has no business trying to be campy or crowd-pleasing.  The tone of this movie is all over the place and rarely dark enough to evoke any real dread (excepting the torture scenes of course).  There's no build.   No suspense.  No characters to care about.  Bad dialogue.  It's the WB on bad acid.
B000EWBKM6|3.0|I was kinda hoping that we would go one season at a time before the series finale but, I guess I'm gonna have to wait a little longer for those... well, I'll be keeping in touch to find out about the dvd release dates of the other seasons...
0743454537|4.0|I read this book on a beach vacation and I honestly did have a bit of difficulty putting it down..after I got of the plane...after I got off the beach...before I went to bed. I just finished it last night. I guess I am sensitive b/c I cried. I can't remember the last time I cried when I read a book...not sure if I EVER did. Anyway, that must say something about this novel! <br />   The story follows the lives of a family and the effects the terminal illness of the eldest daughter has on them. Kate suffers from a rare form of leukemia that requires multiple procedures over the years of her young life. Anna was genetically conceived for the purpose of providing healthy cells/tissues to help Kate fight the disease. Anna first donates at her birth (when umbilical cord blood is donated.) Anna is then subjected to bone marrow transplantation surgery and other procedures to help prolong Kate's life. The topic is controversial and Picoult writes a compelling story.  <br />As I read this, I could almost envision it as a movie script. I don't know why that is. The only reason I can think of is that the characters were very convincing and human. Every character caught my interest: from Anna (very mature and introspective for a 13 year old, to Jesse (juvenile delinquent brother) to Anna's attorney (fairly arrogant, but lovable nonetheless) to the parents. The dialogue was, for the most part, very genuine. There were some hokey elements in Picoult's writing, like cliches and some corny lines. But, those were pretty few and far-between (cliche intended).  <br />Readers will definitely begin to \\"take sides\\" on the issues presented and look at this issue from an ethical standpoint. In addition, readers will look at the story from a very emotional perspective.   <br />
B0002BO05S|5.0|I saw this film mainly because David Lean, one of my favorite film directors, directed some scenes in it.  The film was way over budget at the time, and Lean was an admirer of George Stevens, the director of this film.  So Lean agreed to help Stevens out.  I was pleasantly surprised, and quite moved by this film.  It's one of the most painterly, gorgeously shot films (in UltraPanavision 70, a 2.75:1 widescreen process that looks amazing) I've ever seen.  It's very leisurely in its pacing (which is always welcome), and it tells the oft told story of Christ in simple (though not simplistic) terms.  It's very reverential towards Christ, and the sincerity of the performances reflects that.  There are many star cameos in the film, and this doesn't detract as much nowadays, because as Stevens himself pointed out, the stars back then aren't as well known today, and people can see the film without playing star watcher.  Even though, John Wayne's cameo as a Roman soldier at the crucifixion nearly ruins the film.  It's that bad.  But it can be overlooked.  The film's music score is haunting.  Stevens uses the opening of Verdi's Requiem when Jesus is carrying the cross.  I have only heard this music used once before in a film (in Andrei Tarkovsky's Nostalghia), and it was haunting to hear again.  It's one of the better films about Jesus.  It can stand alongside Ray's King of Kings, DeMille's King of Kings, Zefferelli's Jesus of Narazeth, Pasolini's Gospel According to Matthew, and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ (another unfairly maligned, misunderstood film, but for different reasons).  I really admire Stevens and what he's done here.  This is one of his finest achievements.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|This reminds me of Gus Van Sant's remake of PSYCHO...what little there is that is any good here is lifted wholesale from the original (Burton claimed to greatly dislike Mel Stuart's version, yet he borrows quite liberally), and otherwise adds absolutely nothing. Johnny Depp is awful, and the woeful addition of a backstory, to put it diplomatically, defeats the purpose of Wonka by humanizing him. This version robs the Dahl book and Stuart movie of all the precious moral and otherworldly ambiguities of Wonka, turning him into a pathetic recluse whose cure can only be provided, in Burton's version, by the magic of family. Nauseating.
B00099XBZ8|5.0|I read The Lovely Bones after reading a review of it in a magazine.  I fell in love with the book immediately and it has become one of my favourites.  It is a story that makes you laugh and cry as you follow Susie through her brutal assault and murder and then see through her eyes as her family struggles to cope with the aftermath of her death.  I couldn't put the book down and read it in one afternoon.  I have read it several times since and it is just as fantastic each time as it was the first time.
0790733226|2.0|...when it becomes at turns drearily predictable and unpredictably schmaltzy.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is Jodie Foster...so easy on the eyes, and such a talented actress to boot!  She projects a very attractive spunkiness and tenacity which fit her slightly masculine features perfectly.  The rest of the cast, which includes James Woods, Angela Bassett, and Matthew McConaughy (sp), are pretty competent but they can do only so much when the script goes south towards the end.
B0000009SE|5.0|Although I had heard \\"Freak Out,\\" \\"We're Only in it for the Money,\\" \\"Just Another Band From L.A.\\" and several other Mothers albums, this - along with \\"Hot Rats\\" - was the first Zappa album I ever purchased. I was a trumpet player and this recording had a lot of horns, played primarily by Sal Marquez, so, for a 16 year old looking for cool music for horns, this was the album. \\"Big Swifty\\" takes the entire Side One of the album, something I hadn't heard in rock music up to that time. On the other hand, this recording was so far beyond the \\"progressive\\" rock bands of the day; others began to play catch up with Zappa. <br /> <br />Listen to the guitar solo in \\"Big Swifty\\" with Sal Marquez's muted counterpoint scratching just beneath the guitar, and it is really apparent Zappa was the preeminent composer of the day. The rhythm section of Erroneous on bass, Aynsley Dunbar on drums and George Duke on electric piano keep the piece on a single track without becoming monotonous metronomes; indeed, as others have stated, Dunbar gives a clinic in polyrhythmic percussion. Back in the day, people were talking about Bill Bruford and Ginger Baker - both great percussionists - but Dunbar was the real cutting edge of the drum kit. <br /> <br />The next three songs need to be listened to in succession, from \\"Your Mouth\\" to \\"It Just Might Be a One Shot Deal\\" to the title track, \\"Waka Jawaka,\\" which, after 34 years, still stands as my all time favorite Zappa recording. All that brass! The pedal steel guitar solo (Sneaky Pete Kleinow) in \\"It Just Might Be a One Shot Deal\\" is one of the more awesome moments in Zappa music, not just for the solo, but the backing music as well. But once you get to \\"Waka Jawaka,\\" you're taken on a totally different trip, yet, it seems like the logical extension of the preceding song. All that brass - and a Don Preston Moog solo to boot. <br /> <br />Most of the other reviewers speak of this and \\"Grand Wazoo\\" in the same vein, which is stylistically accurate,but when I listen to this, I almost always listen to \\"Sleep Dirt,\\" \\"Orchestral Favorites\\" or \\"Studio Tan\\" as well, three later albums that have Zappa dipping deep into his instrumental bag, but in a very different direction. <br /> <br />Truly, one of Zappa's greatest recordings. Buy this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This TV show presented a real and believeable idea of the future that viewers could identify with. It was beautiful, and even though it got cancelled, I can only be happy that we got as much as we did. And the movie wrapped things up beautifully.

Since I can't do that, I'll watch an episode and my mood will transform.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|A very intimate, touching, and believable film about a boy that connects with an Alien deeper then we can imagine. He is 8, we would be the same with the little guy. People are dissing the newly remasterd version, don't watch it, you get both versions on the DVD, personally, I like the new C.G.I. effects, quite mindblowing and lifelike. Forget about that stuff, indulge in the story, and the ending is fantastic, a definate tearjearker. And remember people, it is a film and fantasy, look at Spielbergs intent, that what roams in outerspace is not always scary and violent, but have feelings like us. WOW, THAT IS NEW. A fantasic twist and a must see film for family. The extras are very worthy.
6301955595|5.0|As a hardcore Jodorowsky fan I find Santa Sangre his most sentimental film. For anyone who's only seen his more famous work (El Topo, Holy Mountain) from the late 60's, the beginning of this will throw you for a moment. The look of the film stock is completely modern, but you'll soon get over this as his wonderful images begin to take you away. Where his earlier work is filled with the fantastical mysticism of a younger man searching for answers, Sangre is populated by a mature perspective into everyday extraordinariness. Earlier films blazed forward like a twisted locomotive, where this follows a more logical even pace, yet still finds room for his trademark visionary moments within the storyline. Sangre's story (reminiscent of Fando & Lis) draws the viewer in, becoming very personal; and the cast (featuring 3 of Jodorowsky's sons) is superb. Sangre would be a wonderful introduction for anyone tentative about the outlandish cinema of Alejandro Jodorowsky, and I recommend it as highly as his earlier work; as this is yet another side of one of the world's great directors.
B000002MJC|5.0|this is my favorite depeche mode album ever. i love this cd. listen to I feel you, condamnation, in your room and walking in my shoes. those are the best on this album.
B00009RAJJ|4.0|Tusk is definitely one of the best albums ever recorded. But whether you want to replace your old LP or to check out a record you've never heard, beware: the CD version of \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong,\\" one of the best songs on the record, is an inferior alternate take.  In fact, there are four versions of this song on these two CDs, and not one of them is the original.  Hunt down the old LP instead--the artwork is far better at the 12\\" size.  The liner notes to this reissue are not very revelatory; the alternate takes on the second CD are OK, but not worth listening to more than once or twice (except for \\"Beautiful Child,\\" which is as amazing as the LP version); and the lyric sheet contains mistakes.  It's not hard to find used copies of the LP--buy it instead: it sounds fantastic.  (By the way, the single-disc version of the CD also substituted an alternate take of \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" for the originally released--and best--version, so that's not a good option either.)

0815410220|5.0|Whitney Houston exploded onto the music scene in early 1985, signing a deal with Arista Records, under the guidance of Clive Davis. Her self-titled debut, released that year was the beginning of a fruitful career and lapped up some of Whitneys very best work to date.<br /><br />The debut extract would be the sparkling, vibrant ballad, You Give Good Love, produced by the divine Jermaine Jackson. Whitneys positively exquisite and exhilirating vocal delivery was astoundingly powerful, much in the shadow of the great, Aretha Franklin. Despite its glorious content, You Give Good Love bombed on the U.S charts and was therefore not even issued in the U.K through lack of interest.<br /><br />The slice of disco-pop in distinctly 80's style was the angelic, How Will I Know, a rather sappy and girly tune that hardly had the credibility of the previous single, but emerged as a winner where it topped the U.S charts, whilst storming its way into the U.K Top 10 charts. How Will I Know was produced by Narada Michael Walden who would go on to produce more of her work on future albums.<br /><br />Thinking About You was an electric affair with its startling electro-pop orchestrations whilst Whitneys vocal delivery is highly dynamic. More jamming pop follows with the upbeat, Someone For Me, where her rocketing vocal delivery is once again astoundingly strong.<br /><br />The genius Michael Masser who had produced countless soul classics with divine soul diva, Diana Ross, was involved in most of the project and worked his magic again with this breathtaking singer. The ballad, Saving All My Love For You is so uplifting and timeless. The full force of her vocal techniques floods out on this tear-jerker of a classic. Her delivery on here is almost mesmerising.<br /><br />She duets with Jermaine Jackson on the sugary, Nobody Loves Me Like You Do. There is a nice range of harmonies between these two fabulous singers and even a slight air of sexual chemistry between the two sizzles through. All At Once is another sweeping ballad where she is joined by a gospel backing choir on the exalting chrous. All At Once became another huge International hit to her credit.<br /><br />Theres another duet with Jermaine Jackson included with the exotic, late night R&B number, Take Good Care Of My Heart where their vocals are propelled into full effect and both sound equally as magnificent as one another. A timeless collaboration though failed to hit the U.S top 40 charts when released as a single there.<br /><br />Another one of Whitneys most definitive classics follows with her fantastic cover of The Greatest Love Of All where her wide range of spectacular abilities is displayed yet again.<br /><br />Hold Me is a sickly romantic ballad on which she duets with soul crooner, Teddy Pendergrass. Despite the overly syrupy content the track is actually exhilirating on just hearing these two fine singers like captured on record together. Always makes for a dynamic combination.<br /><br />This album is actually quite remarkable for a debut. Consistent, solid and high quality work from one of the greatest singers of our era, it is an indeed timeless classic and stands as some of her most memroable work.s also interesting and potentially worth study since the U S Navy has decided to reintroduce such forces based on lessons learned from Iraq.    From page 535 - 551, Field Marshal Slim offers some specific lessons learned based on the Burma campaign.  The only area where I think he is less than intellectually honest is his discussion on \\"Special Forces\\".  Field Marshal Slim rejects the usefulness of special forces, but if one reviews his actual campaign, he seems to be inclined to argue the usefulness of small groups of elite forces that act as enablers of larger amounts of indigenous troops.  Likewise, he is adamantly against commando and amphibious troops as \\"special\\".  His argument is that all troops should be trained to do these types of things though perhaps not to the level that so called special forces are trained to.    Finally, Field Marshal Slim managed to survive in a complex and bizarre multinational environment.  It seems as if the United States might be in such situations in the future.  Indeed, NATO forces in Afghanistan and Multi-National Forces in Iraq are - while different in detail - much the same in terms of the diplomatic and relationship building that is required of senior military officers.    This is a solid book for a variety of reasons.  I highly recommend it.

But it looks like alot of people including Cloud are ill due to being poisoned by Genvovas blood.<br /><br />Without giving anything away... Everyone from the game shows up just when you want them too and you have one of the SUMMONS show up too.<br /><br />To end.<br /><br />If you are not a Final Fantasy 7 fan then you will not really understand this movie. If you are a fan then you will LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! So it is hard to give this a star rating as you need to sets of stars

B000EHRVP6|4.0|I've noticed many stupid things while cruising through these comments. I enjoyed Hostel in the theatre, and I have just made the dvd purchase as well. I'm at work, I'm bored, and somewhat restless. I'm a regular visitor to IMDB as well as this site, but this is the very first time I have been brave enough to take the dark trek into this so called fan-zone...(or maybe \\"fan-abyss\\" is a more appropriate label). It's nice to see that some people appreciate this film. However, for others to dwell on the plot and all of its inaccuracies is just pathetic. I guess when I was twelve I also had a lot of time on my hands.  <br />This film was an enjoyable horror film....let's leave it at that. A certain individual here hails this work as a \\"soft-core insult to horror films\\". As far as I can remember, sex has always played a pivotal role in the horror genre. In my opinion, the drastic shift from playful, explicit sexual shenanigans to full-out horrific assault, is genius! Unexpected things happen...yes..when you least expect them. Chew on those words of wisdom for a few minutes and a couple seconds! You could be sitting in your car one minute, then be strapped to a gurny the next. The unexpected is what drives horror. <br />The annoying term \\"misogyny\\" is always slid under the creaking door of horror film reviews. Who cares? Let's face it, this genre is aimed at males aged 12-35....give or take a few years. If you want Fried Green Tomotoes, then shimmy on down to the local WalMart, sniff around the dusty bargain bins and you may be rewarded with chick-flick cuddliness. Was that a misogynist comment? Probably....you see I am a man. I don't have a vagina. My girlfriend loves horror films and would never use that dreaded term 'cause she is intelligent enough to know what these films are all about. To call Hostel \\"soft-core\\"...is like calling Showgirls a good movie.....there's a point in there somewhere....if you find it let me know. Here's my review......Hostel is a good movie....take it or leave it!

B000E97Y6A|1.0|I appologise for all my spelling and grammar errors. Im going to be quick and sloppy since I really dont care for this movie at all.<br /><br />I heard somone say that Peter Jackson \\"practised\\" for this movie by making the Lord of the Rings first...<br /><br />About an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out. The beginning wasnt to bad, but then it just started getting plain stupid. For example:<br /><br />Every animal in the jungle seems to be brainwashed by an evil wizard to kill all humans at any cost, without any care for its own health. (Tyranosaurus trying to eat the girl as they are held by vines and about to fall off a cliff, or the thousands of different speces of bugs coming together to kill the crew of the ship)<br /><br />Adrien Brody is the macho tough-guy main character? God.. I hope I dont even need to explain this one.<br /><br />There is a chase scene, where a pack of at least 20 brontosaurus's run through a canyon and the crew of the ship runs along with them between their legs, while fighting velociraptors. Approximately 5 people died in this 10 minute chase in which everyone should have died in the first minute.<br /><br />It seems that they tried to make the humans into bad guys who kidnap innocent Kong who just wants love... (Cant really hold this against the movie, I just think its stupid.)<br /><br />This is a Peter Jackson film.. He showed a lot of talent in The Lord of the Rings.. I expected a more intelligent movie, but then again it is King Kong.
B000A59PQK|5.0|Highly talented writer/director Guy Ritchie delivers another masterpiece with Snatch, that equals the sheer quality and genius of his other masterpiece, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrells. Once again the film is edgy with vast undertones of dark, gritty realism centering on the underworld but refreshingly encapsulates a darkly humorous side to it making the film have an even balance and therefore making it more enjoyable and entertaining in the process. The film has a host of subplots all shrewdly linked to the main storyline and a wealth of characters including a couple of likeley Cockney lads who are two novice unlicensed boxing promotors, Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham), fellow boxing promotor Brick Top (Alan Ford), Mickey O'Neil played by Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy who gets roped into the boxing match where his opposition is rigged to win, Avi (Dennis Farina) as the man due to deliver a stolen 86 carat diamond and Bullet Tooth Villain (Vinnie Jones) who Avi hires to trace the diamond after he is robbed. The characters and performances are superb and vastly convincing, the host of plots are well-structured and the attutude-laced dialogue rides along like a roller coaster. Snatch on the whole is an utterly compelling film that will grip your attention and not let it go until the film is completed. Essential viewing and the extra features on this DVD are an added bonus. Highly recommended!
6302797535|3.0|A decent dinner murder mystery, Murder By Death, brings to the screen the story of a wealthy and eccentric man who invites the five most well known private investigators to his mansion in order to test/challenge their reputation. <br />The cast carries out their performances well enough, the only exception being Peter Sellers who is not that convincing in his role as a Chinese (!) detective. <br />On the positive side:  <br />1) Dinner murder mysteries and mysteries in general are fun to watch. <br />2) Maggie Smith looks gorgeous in the 70's! <br />3) It was interesting to see who this Truman Capote was. <br />On the negative side: <br />1) Capote was really nothing great. <br />2) The acting and the dialogues could have been much better. <br />3) The ending was very weak/silly; a big disappointment indeed. <br />Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />For a wonderful mystery I would recommend Clue, the Movie, starring Tim Curry, not to mention the classic Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes MASTERPIECES.    <br />
1592401791|1.0|This is a very troubling book.    Problems already arise in the prolog. We are told Ringo's habit of putting his cigarette packet on his drum contributed to his unique sound. Clealy this is nonsense. Can anyone identify which songs were recorded with and which without the packet? So how unique can that packet have made the sound?    Then there is the issue of style: much of the book consists of conversations supposedly held in the '60s, quoted word-for-word. Whilst some significant ones may have stuck in Geoff's mind, most must be pure invention. The disturbing thing is this: some conversations contain revelatory details which are historically significant. Which quotes can we believe and which are made up? It's impossible to tell.    But Geoff has I assume, researched the studio records. Combining these facts with his memories and personal experience puts him in a unique position to clarify who played what and when. Surely we can trust him when he describes studio techniques used during recording.    This hope is dashed when, on page 97, he tells us \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" was done with Paul on piano and George on Paul's Hofner bass.     Paul's Hofner is a left-handed guitar. George couldn't possibly have played it. Currently available documentation states Paul did piano, overdubbed bass, and George did acoustic guitar.    This is not a minor niggle. Geoff is a musician himself and surely couldn't have been the source of this idea, so again, this probably was an invention of, I'd say, an unsupervised ghost writer. Had Geoff checked it, I am convinced he would have seen the error immediately.    My gut feel is that, yes, Geoff has many personal recollections and anecdotes, but probably insufficient for a book and so had to be embellished and enhanced. So which parts are enhancements, which are real? We will never know. As I was reading, I made margin notes and cross-references with other books in my library, under the impression that this book is an authoritative source. I feel a little foolish now.    As time takes more and more of those people from us who \\"were there\\", it is important to get their stories as best as they can recall, personal prejudices and all. In this book, Geoff's are lost in the fiction created by his ghost writer. A great shame, and it devalues the book.    And I found I could not even enjoy this book as a \\"faction\\" novel, because the undiscriminating recycling of standard Beatles myths robs it of any feeling of reality.    I don't think Geoff really thoroughly read through this work before it was printed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|One of the best depictions of combat bonding, heroism, and the terrors of war, as experienced by average men who triumph over fear and even the incompetence of their leaders. A great reminder of who does the fighting and dying when war comes. It's not politicians. While this was \\"only\\" a miniseries, few feature films in the genre are its equal. \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" are two worthy companions.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|This is one of the most interesting biographies I've ever seen on film. <br />Until I acquired the DVD, I never fully realized how beautiful this film looked, either. I was stunned to see how spectacular the colors were and how much it helped capture the flavor of the dance hall and the cobblestone streets of France 100 years ago.....and, of course, Tolouse-Lautrec's great artwork. This movie is a feast for the eyes. <br /> <br />The DVD also offers an opportunity to do something I suggest other fans of this movie try: use the English subtitles. This way, you don't have to strain to understand the French accents, notably Colette Marchand's, and it makes this intriguing story even better. <br /> <br />Story-wise, it's a bit of a soap opera but one I still found fascinating, thanks mainly to Lautrec's dialog. He had some really interesting things to say, mostly in a cynical way. That cynicism, unfortunately, caught up with him in the end. Jose Ferrer captured this tortured soul about as well as any actor could expect to do. I'm sorry he didn't win an Academy Award for this performance.  <br /> <br />Viewers who only saw the more recent \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" missed the real story. That movie was a farce; this is the real thing.  <br />
0316287059|5.0|If you like America's Next Top Model, this is the book for you.  In several episodes of America's Next Top Model, the models are transformed into exotic movie stars.  This book shows you how to do it.  I admit some of the colors are a bit daring (bright blue lipstick) but it also shows you how to look beautiful in a subtle way. Martha Stewart's transformation was my favorite one.  Who would of thought?!  This book would also make a very wonderful coffee table book.  I wouldn't recommend this book as a basic beginner's guide but for those who want to take their everday look further.  Overall, it's a gorgeous book to look at.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I am not a person who knows the names of the actors or directors and I don't know their life stories and every film they've ever been in, but I do watch a lot of movies and have been let down too much lately.  This movie is another example.  This movie is just soft core porn at its finest.  Great if you're single and looking for that but watching it with your wife and having no idea what to expect it was annoyingly overdone.  An example, in one scene the three boys (out trying to get laid and find drugs which is all they do the entire movie) are in an apartment talking to another guy.  Not a big deal but in the background the director felt the need to keep the girl having sex right in the shot.  Another example, at one point a security guard has to get up to investigate something and they show what he was watching on his little dvd player and of course its porn, which wasn't bad but the camera stays on his little tv for what seems like forever showing it.  We got the point why overdo it? This was just two of the many many scenes where nudity and overdone sex scenes were involved. Way, way overdone. <br />The actual gore and violence were well done when they finally arrived.  However, it was too late and I just felt like I had seen it before.  I gave it two stars because I think it could be a good movie if someone ever took the premise and did a good job with it instead of this.ntrafaktische Spekulationen bringen nicht so wahnsinnig viel. Panic Room\\" kann man sich ganz gut anschauen und dann auch recht schnell zur Seite legen. Basta. <br />
0375831002|5.0|Death touches us all, but Liesel Meminger manages to touch Death with her shining humanity and the words of her young life, penned in the basement of a poor home, where she survives a devastating bombing of her neighborhood in Nazi Germany.  Death personified holds her luminous grief and happiness in his pocket in the form of a black book containing her young life's autobiography, found by Him, forgotten by her, in the time of her greatest shock and horror.   <br /> <br />Her love of books and the words that make them alive starts with the most unlikely sort of origin: The Grave Digger's Handbook, found in the snow after her six-year-old brother's death.  At almost ten, Liesel cannot read; but a new foster father finds The Book Thief's first volume and uses it to teach her in the darkest hours of night when her terrors awaken her.  Her life with her new papa and her harsh \\"wardrobe\\" of a foster mama begins to take a comfortable shape, and she meets her neighbor, Rudy Steiner, one of the poor tailor's children, but the only one to paint himself black with coal to re-enact Jesse Owens' four-medal triumph at the 1936 Munich games. And the only one whose near-constant request for a kiss, Liesel only grants when it's far too late. <br /> <br />Books come to Liesel, and Liesel helps herself to books-from the remains of a burning pile on the Fuhrer's birthday; from the haunted and ghostly Mayor's wife, for whom Liesel's mama does the washing; and from Hans, the papa who parts with cigarette rations to buy her more to read.  Not long after Liesel settles in Molching, on the outskirts of Munich, Hans Hubermann repays a WWI debt to a fallen comrade by taking the Jew's son Max into his basement.  Liesel and Max share their struggles to survive and their nightmares: hers of a dead brother and his of family left to Hitler's mercies when he went into hiding.  He sends her his regard in her favorite currency:  words, stories made on pages of Mein Kampf painted white, his message the antithesis of those words first sowing and later reaping, so mercilessly reaping, hate in the land.  Bound in growing love as well as the secrecy and desperation of wartime, the girl and man are separated when an act of kindness by Hans makes Max's hiding unsafe. <br /> <br />Richly drawn characters in every color of Death's sadly beautiful spectrum fill this novel, which could seem so bleak but somehow manages the same balance of a well-lived life at its end:  when Death gathers our souls, we can embrace Him in celebration of life; when The Book Thief ends, its sadness is wholly tempered by the joy of reading it. <br /> <br />A personal note:  As an English teacher and now a teacher-librarian in education for fourteen years, I have done a good bit of reading, usually at least a couple of books a week, and that's going back close to 25 years of serious reading, all told.  This novel has shot to among my absolute favorites-the kind of book that ruins us for other books.  In fact, I'm about to read it a second time now that I know where it's going. <br />
B000B8IAOY|5.0|With so much good music from Rob over the years as well as his awesome gore fest films, i have to say i was a little bit apprehensive about this new album. HOW WRONG I WAS, not only is this album full of fresh ideas and sounds with 'Foxy, Foxy' it still keeps with the hardcore metal and classic Rob style with tracks like 'American Witch' and 'Let It All Bleed Out' (which i have to say is my favorite of the album) there's something on here for everyone from the old school White Zombie fans to the new age fans that are just discovering the legend that is Rob Zombie. This is a must have record for anyone who loves Rob's music as much as i do and you would be a fool not to own such a brilliant album.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I'm a huge horror movie fan, for me the gorier the better. So, I picked up a copy of Hostel on DVD. The first half of the movie, in my opinion, was boring as hell. The first half consisted of talking, sex, talking, sex, talking...did I mention sex? If I wanted to see so much sex I'd watch a porno flick. I like horror movies that start right away, and have gore throughout. This movie seriously lacked the action through the first hour of the movie. On a more positive note, the last 35 minutes of the movie caught my attention. So, my advice: Skip to chapter 18 on the DVD and watch the last half. There are chopped off body parts, an eye popped out, and blood everywhere. If you're like me and love gore, you'll probably find the first hour of this movie a big bore, but will be entertained by the last half hour.
006441034X|1.0|I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, including titles primarily intended for children, and I applaud the imagination of the author.  A full-sized castle that roams the hillsides is a fascinating invention.  The author's inclusion of some side trips into modern-day Wales, set in a Welsh-speaking household, were also interesting and commendable.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the poor character development, flimsy story lines, and impausible (if predictable) plot devices made Howl's Moving Castle a painful read at times.  The book seems as though it was published before the final draft was ready, and it could use at least one more thorough edit.  As a reader, I got the sense that the author felt that this was \\"only a kid's book\\" and that a feeble story with plenty of flash would be just fine. <br /> <br />I would like to see Ms Jones match up her strong imagination with a more proven and compelling writer.  Such a team could develop some truly wonderful storytelling!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|One of the best things about this movie is the opportunities the director had for costumes, sets, and special effects and the extent to which he used them.    The opening scene with the effects of the chandelier and all the dust coming off the seats and boxes draws you right into the story and the transition during THINK OF ME is seamless and the going through the mirror is extremely well done, too.    With the costuming, it seemed to me that when Christine ripped off the Phantom's mask, his face was disfigured in more areas than the mask covered.    And I thought that Christine showed a little too much cleavage.    Gerald Butler and Patrick Swift do excellent jobs with their characters, Patrick Swift's impression of Raoul was very close to that in the book.    I was unable to see the director's thinking with Minnie Driver's performance as Carlotta; she switches between a strong French accent and a strong Italian accent and the result isn't laughable, but almost completely un-understandable.    I felt that the worst performance came from Emily Rossum, as Christine. I understand that during most of the show, Christine is in a trance, but Emily Rossum's acting skills are, well, non-existent. She manages to spend the show looking bland and indifferent, from the parts where she's SUPPOSED to grive for her father, be terrified about the fate of her fianc? at the hands of the Phantom, to joy.    I do like this movie a lot, but Schamucher could have made some better decisions.    Also, I don't reccomend this film for anyone under the age of 12 or 13 due to some fairly graphic images that appear only briefly throughout the movie.
B0007U0IQE|4.0|The diminutive Aussie Pop diva, Kylie Minogue is probably more famous and popular than she ever has been before. Though she has never really made it in the U.S she did enjoy some success with this album and has indeed garnered a series of loyal fans in the States who simply lap up her unique work that is not unlike Madonnas earlier output.<br /><br />In late 2001, Kylie scored one of her biggest hit singles in years with the robotic, electro-pop track, Can't Get You Out Of My Heart which is almost trance-like from its slight though compelling repetition. Instantly infectious, Can't Get You Out Of My Head became one of the biggest club hits of 2001 as well as topping several countries around Europe (including the U.K where she has always been a consistently high seller). Following a successful re-invention with the stunning Light Years (2000) on which she moulded herself into becoming a modern day disco diva, it was quite clear that the diva was back, unbeatable, better than ever and even more remarkable.<br /><br />Also making great dance records was infact the entire album which was crammed with ptential hit singles. Though you could argue that the recordings tend to become rather formulaic at some points, it is consistenly infectious, highly enjoyable and is just bursting out with energy. Many of her vocals are synchronised against the highly synthesised effect to add to that essential club feel.<br /><br />This was much the case with another pair of hits from the album, the bouncy, even angelic, Love At First Sight and the mesmerising, In Your Eyes which was utterly compelling with its complex, trance-like musical arrangements.<br /><br />The title track, Fever is a bouncy slice of Pop that is as playful as ever where as showing off her more sassy side was featured on the driving Burning Up which would have made ideal chart material. However more startling was the superb, Give It To Me which contained some highly inventive and origanal musical arrangements that was strikingly quite ahead of its time. Kylie proves to be a dynamic and versatile vocalist on tracks such as these.<br /><br />The hypnotic tone of Fragile is dazzling and hauntingly atmospheric in its mood. What does seem to hark back to her old Stock, Aikten And Waterman sound was the upbeat pop number, On The Dance Floor that was less origanal than the majority of the album. Kylies vocal delivery had clearly improved since her days of bubblegum pop in the late 80's, with her voice having lost that slight nasal sound and has grown more refined, confident and sassy in recent times.<br /><br />Come Into My World is a sassy, sultry, sexually charged number that contains a fabulous performance from Miss. Minogue whilst other tracks on the album are all standard Pop/Dance cuts that when judged on their own merits are still infectious. From the racing rhythm on the albums opening track, More, More, More to the jamming affairs of Love Affair and Burning Up, they each complete the albums line up and round this off as a significant comback in Kylies career (she suffered a lull with her recording career in the late 1990's).<br /><br />Quite possibly on a par with the masterpiece Light Years (2000) album. Even if not, certainly not far behind.ments that was strikingly quite ahead of its time.

B000002UB3|1.0|England's Fab Bore released this album in 1969, during which the Beatles were falling apart at the seams due to creative, financial, and legal issues.  \\"Come Together\\" sounds fake, and everything else is tired.  Who would buy this when you have Pink?  Get her new album instead.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|This is unmitigated camp -- poorly acted, saddled with a sappy New Age soundtrack, excruciatingly \\"sensitive,\\" and full of stereotypes.       Healthy gay audiences -- the ones who aren't perpetually suffering but going out and living their lives unashamedly and without apology -- have already adopted it as a cult film, laughing hysterically and adding new dialogue to screenings in Greenwich Village, where it is already a cult classic on the level of \\"Mommie Dearest\\" and \\"Showgirls.\\"       The only good thing about it is the photography.   Ansel Adams would have been proud.
0790731894|4.0|My attention was fixed to the TV like never before the first time I saw this come on cable. We need more films that can generate suspense as well as this did. But did they really have to have Kurt Russell's character get his foot stuck in that...\\"thing on the wall\\" near the end of the film? I think the movie producers could have come up with a better (and more believable) way to hinder him for the situation he was in. There goes the 5th star.  But, holy cow, did any movie foretell 9/11 better than this one? Airline security employees should have been made to watch this; maybe at least some of them would have believed an event like 9/11 was more probable and taken their job more seriously, preventing the disaster.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. The movie is pretty good, not \\"The scariest movie in years\\" like the cover advertises because lets face it, what was scary about this movie? Nothing, you could figure out everything that was going to happen, well except for the eye ball scene, that was pretty scary...The major downfall to this movie is not the movie itself but the whole advertisement of the so called \\"Unrated\\" version. Come on this gimic is getting way to old with DVD's. I saw the movie in the theater and now on DVD, what is diffrent between the two? I saw nothing. Why are companies allowed to get away with labeling DVD's as unrated when there is nothing diffrent than the theatrical version? Oh wait...I know...So they can make more $$. Don't be fooled when you buy this movie that you're going to see tons of good gore you missed in the theater because this unrated cut is no diffrent than the theatricl cut, but, if there was something I missed please I encourage someone to educate me on where it was I missed either the extra gore or extra boobies. <br />If you want to see some decent gore, and boobies than see this movie.
B00002E233|4.0|Except for the segment on Alzheimer's Disease, this should be a movie where excitement and verve take center stage. Sure, it's less intense than Jaws, but it is darker and creepier than Jaws. For a summer movie, it does do well when it comes to escaping reality. Escapism is big here, so it should not be taken way too seriously.
B00006I53S|5.0|This is great multi pupose lens and image stabilization feature is amazing. I get more and more pictures which I like to keep than delete. In indoor low light conditions I bounced the flash (Speedlite) off of our white ceiling and the results are excellent.
1565634519|5.0|Aretha Franklin, daughter of a famous Pentecostel pastor, inevitably began singing in a church choir at a very early age and it was clear then that she had the gift of a deep, raw talent where her vocal style was capable of such immense power and volume.<br /><br />She began her career recording secular tracks for Columbia Records, none of which really bought her much chart recognition. Signed by John Hammond at the dawn of the 1960's, he tried invain to nurture her talent effectively. By the time of 1966, all she had released a string of minor selling hits.<br /><br />So in 1966 she signed a new deal with Jerry Wexler (who had enjoyed enormous success with such fantastic Soul music legends as the unforgetable Ray Charles and the divine Wilson Pickett) to Atlantic Records which finally propelled her into International stardom.<br /><br />The label knew how to enhance her raw talent and captured her rocketing vocal style on some of the most remarkable recordings in the history of music. If anything, Aretha Franklin went on to become the female equivalent of that godfather of soul, James Brown.<br /><br />The music was tough, driving, earthy even stark at times yet was able to encapsulate a sensual, evocative air that was able to enjoy credibility in the more profitable white-buying market as well as firmly retaining her wide, loyal black base much in the way other black female singers had like Diana Ross.<br /><br />Her most important and significant era in music undoubtedly was between 1967-1969. During this relativley small period she clocked up an amazing series of soul classics that set standards today and are still as instantly recognisable as they were then with them always being constantly used as backing tracks to several T.V commercials.<br /><br />Aretha races along those speedy verses of Respect (origanally by Otis Redding) with such startling conviction and when she sings those lyrics you just KNOW she means every word she says. Her pronounciations and impeccable lyrical phrasing is remarkably effective on this explosive classic and Respect rates as one of her most popular classics.<br /><br />As well as the more urban-contemporary material, Aretha proved adept at experimenting in a number of styles and her voicesurprisingly could sound as equally compelling on the ballads.<br /><br />I Say A Little Prayer was one of her most passionate, heart-felt ballads. Whilst the lyrics were simplistic, Aretha could shrewdly plumb such depth with a straight-foward song such as this.<br /><br />Dr. Feel Good, the fabulous Think (which she would update in the movie, The Blue Brothers) and the sparse production of Chain Of Fools continued her staggering run of hits and all conveyed such an undeniably infectious quality.<br /><br />From the 70's onwards Aretha Franklins work became erratic, initially losing some of the fire of her famous late 60's period. She still managed to come up with the odd winner such as the exciting Rock Steady and sensational, Day Dreaming but the consistency was no longer there.<br /><br />The 80's and 90's saw Aretha recording only sporadically and when so was always a conciously contemporary effort which vastly met with an indifferent view from critics.<br /><br />She enjoyed a touching, vibrant duet with divine soul crooner George Benson on Love All The Hurt Way whilst the more upbeat Jump To It saw her collaborate with Luther Vandross as producer.<br /><br />The jamming Pop sounds of Who's Zoomin Who in 1985 became another notably sizeable hit to her credit as did her dynamic, explosive duet with Eurythumics singer, Annie Lennox on the catchy Sisters are Doin' It For Themselves.<br /><br />She also recorded one memroable duet with another one of my favourite singers, George Michael on the overly subtle and laid-back, I Knew You Were Waiting For Me where both vocal harmonies were blended beautifully together.<br /><br />This compilation highlights the very best of her work (including all tracks just mentioned) and so quite possibly goes down as the definitive collection of the undisputed Queen Of Soul.est of her work (including all tracks just mentioned) and so quite possibly goes down as the definitive collection of the undisputed Queen Of Soul.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000E6UK5K|4.0|First off, I really liked the video clip included on Amazon's site where Gilmour talks about the current production.  Very interesting.  I am a longtime Floyd fan, and I can honestly say that the first record I bought with my own money (at age 12 in 1977) was Dark Side of the Moon. <br /> <br />     Since then, I've purchased most of the band's catalogue, and even obtained a few good bootlegs of live concerts. Unfortunately, I have never seen them live.  (Although I did see Waters in 1986 for the Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.) <br /> <br />     I heard the album once at a friend's house and the next day I went out and bought it.  I am enjoying this album immensely, and for good reason. <br /> <br />    Anyway, I have a theory about at least one theme on this album.  I believe that David decided to loosely re-interpret certain Floyd songs and solo work with new techniques on this album. <br /> <br />    Let's start with the artwork. On the cover of the soundtrack to the film \\"More\\" can be seen Don Quixote jousting with a windmill.  And sure enough, on page 10-11 of the booklet, you'll notice some kids playing in front of two windmills.  (with their arms pointed upward the same way the people on the cover of \\"More\\" are pointing)  <br /> <br />    Now to the songs.  Blue seems to have the same lazy feel that Pillow of Winds has, and I am convinced that the soaring guitar is a loose reference to the electric guitar leads in that song. <br /> <br />   Take a Breath uses roughly the same chords  (E and D#) as Astronomy Domine, played at a different tempo.  It is the hardest rocking song on the album, and shows that David didn't forget what the band was all about in 1968, when the crazy diamond was still with the band. (Syd Barrett) <br /> <br />   Red Sky at Night has an intro that sounds very much like Shine on You Crazy Diamond and of course, like Shine, he switches over to saxaphone for the intro lead, just like in Shine, although Parry did the sax work back in 1975. <br /> <br />    Then I Close My Eyes repeats the theme (musically) embedded in Blue.  Of course, all the while the guitar work is simply sublime.  Here is a man who has mastered his craft, and can create an entire set of emotional feelings without any words!  Thanks also to the Polish film composer and the orchestras for their part in synthesizing the material.  Of course, the Floyd has always been good material for film scores, and the marraige works well. <br /> <br />    A Pocketful of Stones has heavy references to Wish You Were Here, with two songs from that album embedded in it.  The tense feeling of marching forward found on the end of Welcome to the Machine can be found at approximately the 8:00 minute mark in this song.  At the same time, the guitar work seems to echo the lyrical phrasing of Shine on You Crazy Diamond. <br /> <br />    Finally, the simple little ditty called \\"Smile\\" seems to have the background vocals mimicking the vocals at the end of \\"Near the End\\" from 1984's About Face.  It's the part where Gilmour says, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh Ooh...Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh Ooh in Near the End that sounds like the background vocals (group singing) in Smile. <br /> <br />    There are probably other similarities that I have missed, (I've only had the album for two days) but my instinct says this was ONE, (not the only) theme of this album.  An older master musician looking back on his life and wondering what it all means.  And let's face it, these old songs that he is referencing are songs that he either wrote or had a big hand in crafting.  He liked them when he wrote them, and I'm sure he still likes them. <br /> <br />    Is the album earth shattering?  No.  Is it cutting edge?  No.  Is it different?  Yes.  Even though the old songs somehow manage to permeate the subtext of the final product, the finished results are new and engaging.  And for his tasty guitar work alone he should be commended.  Two thumbs up for this work.  My only regret was not seeing him at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan last week when my friend went and kept calling me on his cell phone so I could hear the music.  I didn't even know he was there until the next day!  Maybe one day I'll actually get to see the master live in concert.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie shattered my expectations. After pining for this release on the advent of it's discovery through the pages of an Official Playstation Mag ( shameless plug, but meh) we have next week's release. And just to set the record straight, I have seen the DVD, I own the subtitled version with the Japanese dubb, so it is very relevant to this product as the version I have is included in ...awww, who cares, lets get to the meat of this veggie meal thus far. It's beautiful, visually, and audio-....ly. It made me laugh, made me sit up as I bore witness to some of the most amazing action scenes ...EVER! ( puts the matrix, and every other western idolized action sets to shame... shame, shame shame)It's story was rife with nostalgia and sentimental bits, and just made me grin from ear to ear. The ending will have you and a box of tissues getting wicked intimate. Bottom line, a must buy. It's like Square-Enix entered the collective dream scapes of every fan boy/girl and manifested this product. Forget the Spirits Within, this is how an FF picture is done. On a side note, the enjoyment of this product might be impaired for first timers, so it does enhance the experience if you are coming into the movie a VII veteran. Cheers, and enjoy your trip back to Midgar!...

0143036424|4.0|Being in the book business, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing, the kind of author with so much talent and drive that anyone who buys one of their works will be back the next day to buy the rest. I've seen writers like Lee Child and Michael Connelly go from buzz to best seller, and I love that brief window of opportunity when I can hand sell a relatively unknown author I know will knock people out. <br /> <br />Craig Johnson is a new voice that his publisher Penguin believes can become the next Hillerman. Both Craig and Penguin have sent our bookshop posters, postcards and various promotional items (word to the wise - chocolate and money work best) in order to bring him to the attention of our customers. Johnson's protagonist is Walt Longmire, an aging, small town sheriff in Wyoming. (The aging thing is always a poignant touch, but it can get awkward when it's the starting point in a continuing series - those Vietnam vets aren't going to be able to keep punching people out for very much longer.) Walt's rather pedestrian duties are suddenly enlivened by the death of a young man who had been involved in the gang rape of a Native American girl. When a second guilty party is also killed it becomes apparent that the first death was no accident, and unless the crimes are solved the town could explode. <br /> <br />Longmire is a likeable, gruff and very decent character, a man just emerging from mourning the death of his long time wife, and the reader is drawn effortlessly into his world. Johnson skillfully immerses the reader in the rhythms and mores of the West, smoothly integrating history and folklore into the evocative landscape. Like Hillerman, he captures the dangerous beauty of the area as well as the equally dangerous tensions between the Native Americans and the rest of the community. <br /> <br />I found the middle of the book less compelling, however. Small town policing can get pretty tedious at times, and it's challenging to present that in a way that's true to life yet maintains the pace of the book, a challenge that Johnson's not always up to. I also found some of the characters like the-pithy-member-of-a-minority-best-friend and the-beautiful-rich-woman-known-in-childhood-from-the-other-side-of-the-class-divide to be a little stock. <br /> <br />But the sting is in the tail, as they say, and for me Johnson's ending more than redeemed any reservations I may have had, and in fact turned some of them on their head. He delivers the kind of kick ass, gut wrenching, truly surprising resolution that not too many writers can pull off these days, and it immediately made me yearn for Death Without Company, the next book in the series. Craig Johnson may not be the next big thing, but he'll definitely do until it comes along.
B000002GQE|2.0|With the exception of Yes, Steely Dan is generally the closest I come to prog-rock. So if you think I don't really know the genre, you're right. However, I feel this is overblown and pretentious. Granted, all that can't stop Nights In White Satin from being an incredibly powerful, lovely piece (other than the crappy stoner poem at the end). But even then, it doesn't strike me like the work of Yes (specifically Close to the Edge and Starship Trooper). The rest is overblown and endless, especially all eight-and-a-half minutes of the aptly-titled Forever Afternoon. If you're looking for grade \\"A\\" prog-rock, go with Yes.
B00003CXAW|5.0|The power of myth has always remained in the collective unconscious. This classic of classics alludes to the well known archetype of \\"The beauty and the beast\\". But you should realize all archetypes are ambivalent by its own nature.<br /><br />The virginal beauty of Fay Wray contrasts in 180 degrees, respect the impetuous presence intrinsic wildness and visible attraction aroused involuntarily by her, where the Darwin concepts clearly, suggests us the evolution maintains the primordial principle of the attraction of the opposites.
B00005LMBK|2.0|I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so \\"out there\\" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD.     That was the case with Demon Days. After enjoying that CD fully, I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD, and  I didn't like it all that much.     There just seems to be very little actual songs on the CD. Way too much of it sounds like complete filler. There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days, but most of the stuff on that CD was great. Here, we've got songs that are just...boring. Nothing happens. I was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs, but it never happens. You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background. (Such as on songs like New Genious, Man Research, and Starshine.) Some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all, sometimes sounding just like static noise. Songs like this, such as Double Bass, are cool for a minute or two, but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes. It gets boring. Other songs, like 5/4, M1 A1, and Rock the House are catchy at first, but just don't have staying power. They get old. 5/4 got annoying quickly, M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal quickly, and Rock the House is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. And songs like Latin Simone are just annoying.     The remixes of 19-2000 and Clint Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable, although 19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens.     There are some good songs here, though. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, Gravity, 19-2000, and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool songs. Slow Country's kind of cool, too. And Dracula's got an awesome, almost haunting sound to it,and it's really absorbing. Although it too, unfortuantely, loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it. This small collection of good songs, though, is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks. Much of this CD just isn't really that good.    I don't know...this CD just seemed empty. Very few meaningful tracks, lots of filler, and some really annoying and repetitive songs. Some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long, mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs. Clocking in at 72 minutes, (which makes it 22 minutes(!)longer than Demon Days) this CD was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff. People interested in The Gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up, Demon Days, instead of this one. If I listened to this debut CD first, I probably wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. The good news about this is that the Gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump; their CDs are getting better, not worse. That is a great sign for the future of this awesome band.
0679736646|5.0|This may well be Philip K Dick's best.  When one of his competitors top telepaths disappears off the face of the Earth, Glen Runciter, who runs an anti PSI firm, goes to consult with his deceased wife.  Recently deceased Loved Ones can be placed in a moratorium, where they enter into half life.  There they can be resurrected briefly for communing only.  Runciter and eleven of his staff are commisioned to travel to Luna for a secret project.  It turns out to be a trap, and Runciter is killed.  Joe Chip, a top techie of the firm takes charge.  At this point reality becomes obscured and it is difficult to know whether Runciter is dead, alive, or in half life, the same goes for his eleven member team.  UBIK is a miracle product, a force for good.  Then there's Pat, one of the eleven, who can change the future by altering the past.  Lastly there's Jory a half lifer with terrible powers over other half lifers.
B00004TEUX|5.0|Though this recording dates back almost fifty years (1957), for this listener this is the most exciting and enchanting version of Mendelssohn's 'Incidental Music for A Midsummer Night's Dream' available!  Peter Maag conducts the London Symphony Orchestra in a fleetingly airy performance that draws so much of the flavor of Shakespeare's comedy that it outshines the competition.  Maag also appropriately uses the female voices in two movements as per Mendelssohn's design and the parts of fairies as sung by Jennifer Vyvyan and Marion Lowe (two fine stalwarts from the era of this recording) are incredibly additive.  Maag simply understands Mendelssohn's orchestration and draws a superlative performance from his orchestra.<br /><br />And that is not to say that the Symphony No. 3 in A minor (\\"Scottish\\"), Op. 56 is not worthy of attention.  Again Maag conducts with finesse and flair and makes the symphony sound as fresh and atmospheric as any conductor's performance today.  This is a superb recording, well re-mastered, and at this price it is even a monetary as well as  a musical bargain!  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, April 06
B000AARKOO|5.0|This movie is fanastic, and as a teacher I love it too.  This movie does a great job of capturing the various views on the Crusades and nicely illustrates the ideologically diverse nature of the politicos on both the Christian and Muslim side.  As a teacher I am infatuated with this movie because aside from showing the nature of the Crusades themselves, it does a splendid job of showing medieval warfare and seige technologies.  As a teacher, if you are unsure of any historical facts, the bonus disc includes subtitles that explain a great amount of the historical truths about the Crusades and the people involved in it.
B00005RHGK|2.0|This movie is by far the worst scripted horror movie I have ever seen.  You know all the cliche moments you hate when you watch this genre?  this movie had them all.  From main characters acting stupid and stubborn when wisdom says otherwise, to procrasting when you should be running away for help, to making bad decisions at every turn.  This was just a very pathetic way to string together what you would normally call a plot. <br /> <br />The story itself was pretty decent and the main actors gave a nice perfomance too.  If the script had been written by someone who actually had a triple digit IQ, it might have been entertaining.  There were just too many illogical or unreasonable elements that made this movie seem so dumb, for a lack of better word.  On top of these elements, the flow of the movie was also too simplistic.  Not only did they give away the ending halfway through the movie, you can basically call out what would happen next, two-thirds of the time.  I really wanted to like this movie more than I did - Nice idea for a story, decent actors, fitting backgrounds and mood music - But the plot and the script was just too bad and that's what ultimately killed the movie.  Don't waste your time with this one.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Actually pretty darn good, to my surprise. I heard of Buble for a while, but I'm so used to listening to Sinatra era singers, I figured this guy is just another hype. It just happened the other day, I was dining at a resturant and some familiar tune was playing. Hmm, it's Come Fly With Me, for a minute, I thought it's Sinatra, but the smooth voice has that different youthful energy. Later I found out it's Buble. I've been listening to his albums lately. It's nice to have some fresh voices like Buble now to carry these familiar tunes. He is still young and his voice and singing really has that true crooner quality. I bet he would even make old blue eye himself proud.    And a quick comment regarding Roger's review. It's strange that you had problem playing this cd on computer. I have no problem playing it and loading it onto my ipod. I know two of my friends who bought this cd don't have any problem either.
B00005ASGG|4.0|Based on a short story by Dorothy M. Johnson, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE tells the story of Ransom Stoddard, an eastern attorney who has the misfortune to be victimized by notorious outlaw Liberty Valance during a stagecoach robbery.  Left for dead, Stoddard is rescued by rancher Tom Doniphon and brought to the small town of Shinbone.  Disgusted by the lawlessness of the area, he determines to use not a gun but the law itself to end Valance's reign of terror.<br /><br />Released in 1962, VALANCE was among the last films directed by John Ford, who was more closely associated with the Western than any other Hollywood director--and in one sense it certainly has the classic \\"good guy vs. bad guy\\" plot one expects from from a western classic.  But Ford was not a superficial artist, and VALANCE is a remarkably multilayered film that plays much deeper than you might expect.<br /><br />Tom Doniphon is all that is right about the west; Liberty Valance is all that is wrong.  But both are part and parcel of the same code, a society in which law and order are merely words on the lips of a cowardly marshall, a world where a man either dominates through fear or is dominated by it.  It is a world that is coming to an end--and Rance Stoddard is in the vanguard of the new civilization.  Both Doniphon and Liberty must fall before Stoddard if the worst of the west is to be tamed.<br /><br />The cast is superior.  James Stewart (Stoddard) and John Wayne (Doniphon) have unexpected chemistry on screen, and Lee Marvin (Valance) is easily one of the most unpleasant black-hats you could ever want to see in a western, vicious to the point of being psychotic.  Supporting players Vera Miles, Andy Devine, Edmund O'Brien, and Woody Strode are equally fine.  Although the script is occasionally a shade overwrought, it is laced with a very fine irony and sense of loss, and John Ford brings all the various pieces together without beating the viewer to death in the process.<br /><br />The DVD release offers nothing in the way of extras beyond the theatrical trailer.  The film itself is a bit streaked in places, but it is quite good.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerhe DVD release offers nothing in the way of extras beyond the theatrical trailer.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|I will admit it is hard not to watch any drama placed in a great American historical context, and Cold Mountain is no exception.  It is a great love story, a story of the insanity of war (cursing all metal that makes blades and guns; or as Ruby says, men make rain, complain when the skies grey and it rains and they're soaking wet--a metaphor for war).<br /><br />Every viewing shows more and more subtlety and this is first-class from having Mr. Daniel Troiani as uniform consultant to the haunting echoes of the original soundtrack supervised by T-Bone Burnett, including the fantastic fiddling or \\"newcomer\\" Dirk Powell of Louisiana and arrangement by the great Ralph Stanley, to the correct use of an Italian mandolin (rare in 19th century American pieces--such as \\"Wild Bill\\")....to an earthiness that apparently only the country of Romania could provide--and did.<br /><br />As for the brutality of war--any film cast against such a backdrop must portray it, and if we wish to avoid such things they must be portrayed--but this is not tasteless (being reminded of Dog Day Afternoon when it first was released), and a love story of this type (a romanace of years based on little encounter between a man and a woman) is typical of the home front in the Civil War, when whole towns were decimated of their young men in their prime--to the extent of some being completely abandoned after the conflict.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman portrays not a Southern Belle but a conflicted daughter of a minister whose first \\"productive\\" work of a lifetime is building a fence on her deceased father's property with Renee Zellweger, who turns in a meritorious performance from start to finish--the Falstaff of a tragic story from start to finish.<br /><br />At the end--when young Inman is killed by a home guardsman in a duel fueld by the \\"confidence of youth\\" versus the experience of Odysseus...(one does have to wonder how this young guardsman escaped concription)....if you don't feel the brunt of heartsickness over the inhumanity of man to man (which of course would have led you to stop viewing)...you simply cannot relate to the truly human dimensions of a great film.  There is no underlying subtle theory here, such as in \\"The Damned\\" which attempts to explain Nazism through Freudian theory...no, this is a great love story, an American story told against the backdrop of great American history, and for that I can find no fault--except the appearance of Kidman's black corset in the only love scene--where did that come from?  A bit of an unnessary distraction at that particular poignant moment.<br /><br />Most highly recommended.artsickness over the inhumanity of man to man (which of course would have led you to stop viewing)...you simply cannot relate to the truly human dimensions of a great film.

B000EGCITG|5.0|I love this album! I didn't think it could get much better than Miszundastood!, but this CD rocks. I was especially touched by Dear Mr. President, which is a constructive criticism of the current president and his war. It's nice to hear young artists giving their political opinion.

B000A2H9XO|2.0|You have to respect his resume...Reservoir , Pulp etc , however when did Tarantino start putting his name out for tender? I can not believe he is associated with this movie. <br />Although essentially a good idea for a simple plot , this film casually meanders into the realms of gratuitous violence and Human depravity, gently interspersed with mild nudity and whimsical suspense. This movie would have been labeled a video nasty ten years ago, due to its  graphic content and lack of any believable dialogue. Films that create suspense do so by excellent acting, imaginative cinematography , good direction, suggestion and  dramatic musical score , this film lacks all of the aforementioned! <br />However if your 'thing' is to be titillated by violence , unnecessary gore , malicious use of torture instruments and pain , then I suppose this trash ' hits the right spots ' <br />Entertainment.....No.  <br />I believe this is a film that Taratino needs to propel narcissism , money and his own unpublicised writers block...I know it's not actually his film...but putting his name to this, is a confirmation of sell out and lack of  creative imagination.
B00005JOE8|4.0|I thought that this was a good little political thriller, it had some outstanding dialogue, exemplery effects & an overall pretty good little screenplay. Portman does a great job for such a vague charactor and \\"V\\" is a wonderful part as a whole, he truly represents a true, opinionated and couragous hero. I thought that it got stuck in the mud and began to get a little slow their in the middle but it sped up again in the end and overall it succeeded in being what slowly becomes a very unique \\"Marvel\\" film. Some of the parts of the film I thought were very clever such a the speech that \\"V\\" makes @ the beginning of the movie in  which he speaks in words that all start with the letter \\"V\\". Some other people say that you should read the comic book (I believe it is), before watching the movie so that you have a full understanding about what is going on and that way you can enjoy the \\"Deeper Meaning\\" as well, ... I went into the theatre hearing good things and I most definatly was not dissapointed! <br /> <br />Grade: B

B00005JOE8|1.0|Man oh man, when they said \\"Sleeper Cell\\", they weren't kidding with this one.<br /><br />Call it Snoozer Cell. Or since we're discussing poor Jimmy McTeigue's awkward, mind-numbingly dull lobotomy of Alan Moore's brilliant and haunting \\"V for Vendetta\\"---and since it's set in not-so-jolly-old-England in the hazy, crazy future---then, in the spirit of the Cockney dialect why don't we just call it \\"F for Foooking Awful\\"?<br /><br />Try  \\"B for Bowdlerized\\": the cinematic \\"V\\" is one plopped into the digital blender and stripped of its drama, boiled down, recycled, pureed, bled dry of its horrible irony and all too balefully human black heart.<br /><br />McTeigue cut his teeth setting up the slick action shots for the Matrix flicks, and it shows: in \\"V\\" there is a doozy of a fight sequence, and it's a bracing example of what the flick might have been---balletic, nimble, unapologetically brutal, almost graceful.<br /><br />But then McTeigue---and his well-heeled handlers, the gender-bending Wachowskis---get down to business: sticking it to G.W. Bush and those fiendish Americans!<br /><br />The story, which needed no fiddling, is fiddled with, the better to make Hugo Weaving's black-hatted Hamlet a white-helmeted paragon of Freedom: the sinister, blighted landscape of post-Apocalyptic Britain at the guts of the graphic novel is replaced by a UK gone fascist after a bout of nasty pox. Evey is no longer a prostitute, with nowhere to turn: now she's a pert, preppy, abs-and-thighs of steel -production assistant.<br /><br />And so: gone is the dark, wicked, twisted, nimble brilliance of Alan Moore's sinister diptych set in a post-apocalyptic totalitarian England, replaced by something that plays like a \\"V\\" Cliff's Notes for the terminally ADHD-set.<br /><br />S for Subtext! The Wachowskis really hate George W. Bush! We get it!<br /><br />F is for Fashionable, baby, Yeah! Terrorism is, like, you know, the new Black! It has a real thinning effect! And nothing brings a people together more than blowing up an historic national landmark with a tube-train filled to the brim with fertilizer bombs---does that mean Tim McVeigh is a posthumous performance artist?<br /><br />H for Hot! With that in mind, when she's not emoting her pretty little skull off or crying or writhing around on the ground in her cute little prison smock, clasping her little shaved-like-a-peach head---well God, blokes, is Natalie Portman not one peachy bird, baby? Yeah! I know the next time I dial up Madama Helga's I'll have to remember \\"V\\" and ask for the \\"Portman Schoolgirl Special\\". Rowrrrr, baby, behave!<br /><br />T for Teeth: as in, Jesus F*cking Christ the English have bad Teeth! When V's Halloween-party army takes over and the morning-after shivers wear off, the first act of legislation the new Government of the People should pass is one of free orthodontics: if whatever they were doing over at Larkhill caused these plaguey-bad choppers, then V was onto something, after all!<br /><br />Oh yes, and T for Thespians, too! Whatever \\"V\\"'s faults, the acting is nearly sublime: all hands man their battle stations, and go down with this reeking turd---but throw out some fine performances along the way. Portman turns in the performance of her career as Evey; Stephen Rea (Finch) sulks his way through another flick; Stephen Fry (the snaggle-toothed Gordon) rejoices that he's at least not in \\"Gosford Park\\"; John Hurt (Sutler) twirls his mustachios; and Hugo Weaving phones it in from beneath a heart---or face, anyway---of Oak.<br /><br />D for Deep Pockets! As in, where the h*ll did the freewheeling, itinerant V get enough money to afford Guy Fawkes costumes for the entire population of the British Isles? And come to think of it, wouldn't that sort of order have attracted notice? \\"Made to order: 20 million Guy Fawkes outfits. COD.\\"<br /><br />B for Burkha!

1589395344|5.0|For some reason people call this an album. It's really a story, an unpredictable story (for the first time you listen to it anyway) that takes you to a lot of strange and wonderful places. Sigur Ros only properly came into the public eye in the UK when they released Takk..., and if that's the only SR you've heard then &Aacute;gætis Byrjun may surprise you. It's as dark compared to Takk as the deep blue of the album cover suggests and singer Jonsi's vocals are nowhere near as falsetto as on Takk. There are two ways to listen to this, either get it on your car's CD player when driving through the Icelandic countryside in winter or just stick it on your headphones whilst lying in bed with the lights off. Apart from Olsen Olsen, all the songs have actual Icelandic lyrics, which the whole of () and a fair bit of Takk do not, but if you don't understand Icelandic you can still make up what it all means as you listen just the same, that's probably the best way.

It's a pity Paramount has overlooked this film.I am looking forward to seeing a SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION release which includes:an anamorphic widescreen transfer,a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound,English subtitle(the current one doesn't even have this standard feature!),audio commentary with Ridley Scott and/or Michael Douglas,interviews,or other featurettes of the film.

B000AJJNPY|1.0|Holy crap!!!! I just borrowed this sleeping pill from the library and I must say, with a doubt, that the \\"amazing music\\" being played within the confines of the demonic-designed dustjacket/slipcase is probably one good reason for the high mortality rate during the Arctic nights in Iceland. This is New Age music wrapped in a big, furry parka with that little Muppet, Beeker (remember that little dude, the one shaped like a test tube, that could only say \\"Mee-mee-mee-mee\\"? It's him!), singing all the leads (he must be doing some multi-tracking of his voice). An ambiant drone, for sure. Fluid sounds, like writing your name in the snow, guys. This band must have taken Frank Zappa and The Mothers record title seriously - \\"We're Only In It For The Money\\". Bjork could fart into a microphone for 30 minutes and come up with something about as \\"ambiant\\" and \\"soothing\\". One reviewer called this music \\"mind-numbing\\".

0380789035|5.0|I stumbled across this book when browsing for good fictional novels featuring Loki Norse god of trickery and to a milder extent fire. I was already getting into Neil Gaiman via The Sandman comics so when I read a couple of reviews on American Gods it wasn't long before I bought the book.<br /><br />American Gods can be complex and occasionally hard to keep track of with its multiple characters but it is an original story with an unique, none too typical hero known as Shadow. There's lots of humour and good twists and I found it impossible to put down, in fact, as soon as I finish my current novel I can't wait to re-read it!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice has been translated to film several times now - from Robert Leonard's 1940 \\"attempt\\" starring Laurence Olivier, to the 1980 and 1995 TV miniseries', and now on to a new theatrical release here. Having read the book and seen all of these adaptations, I feel I can comment objectively on what does and doesn't work with regards to director Joe Wright's newest version.<br /><br />Let's start with the positives. It's beautifully filmed (from gnarled old trees to stunning sunsets against old English mansions) and the cast performs well. I even liked Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods, FOYLE'S WAR TV series) and the rest of the actors. They seemed to be able to grasp the internal dynamics of their respective characters and pulled in fine performances. Keira Knightley (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, 2002) does a good job as Lizzie Bennett but appears upbeat far too often during a time when love and loss went hand in hand. Matthew Macfayden (WUTHERING HEIGHTS TV series) does an admirable Mr. Darcy but being up against a giant of the English acting world from a previous adaptation made his character representation a bit tougher when it came to comparisons.<br /><br />Now let's get into my main problem: the pacing. I usually don't mind fast-paced films, but Jane Austen's book is anything but quick (checking in at around 500 pages depending on which publisher you choose). Books of this size tend to be difficult to translate to the silver screen (or TV) because of their scope, and this was the big \\"ouch\\" for this film. Clocking in at 129 minutes, condensing the book in such a drastic manner meant clipping out chapters and causing a bit of confusion. The confusion comes from the lack of understanding a new viewer might have IF they've never seen any of the previous TV/movie versions or IF they've never read the novel. When Lydia runs off with \\"the wrong man\\" it is a vital portion of the story that is only touched on and could seem disorienting to the new Pride and Prejudice viewer. We never see what happens to Lydia in London, nor do we see the wedding and where Mr. Darcy's pressure exerts itself.<br /><br />Comparisons will obviously be made between this theatrical release and the 1995 miniseries (which many, including myself, feel is the penultimate adaptation of Mrs. Austen's book). Some might complain that it isn't fair to make such comparisons because one was designed for television while the other was meant for theater. I'll grant that. But with the lengthy films that've come out of Hollywood lately (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, etc.), I don't feel that this new version would've suffered in the slightest by lengthening its running time and thus adding a better sense of coherency to many of the side stories. The 1995 miniseries also had an incredible benefit in that Mr. Darcy was played by the estimable Colin Firth (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998), and it is THIS Mr. Darcy that many hold as the high standard for such work. Try putting Matthew Macfayden up against Mr. Firth and you'll see what I mean; there's just no comparing them.<br /><br />I did give this film a positive review because a) I liked the cinematography, and b) the acting was generally well done. But for emotional impact and excellent character portrayals look to the 1995 miniseries.and Prejudice viewer.

B0007TKNII|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is a movie that teaches people not to judge people by their appearance. The message isn't even the best part though. It's the plot that is amazing! <br /> <br />Christine Daae is a girl/woman (phantom always calls her child but she looks grown to me) who lives in the opera dormitories of the opera house (Opera Populaire). She introduces her voice to Paris when Charlotta (prima donna) leaves. Everyone is absolutely astounded by her voice including the Phantom of the Opera, Erik, (but they just call him the phantom in the movie). After Christine's amazing understudy performance the Raul, childhood friend/ lover of Christine, comes to her room and talks with her but the really big thing that happens after Christine's performance is the phantom introduces her to the music of the night. He tells Christine \\"I need you with me to serve me to sing\\" talk about MUSIC! <br /> <br />The Phantom, Gerard Butler, performs an amazing song, The Music of the Night. It's beautiful! Anyway, let me stop telling the story. The movie is amazing and needs to be on your before-I-die-to-do-list. The movie made me see the world in a whole new way and is one with my soul. Watch it. Live it. YOU KNOW YOU CAN NOT FIGHT THE POWER OF THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT! <br />

B00064AESI|5.0|\\"The sting\\" (1973) might be an old film, but I think it is sensible to say that, for all practical purposes, it is new for those who haven't watched it before. That was my case, and it might be yours :)<br /><br />The story is set in the thirties, and it is nothing less than excellent, good enough to keep you at the edge of your sit. Hooker (Robert Redford) and Luther (Robert Earl Jones) are con artists that steal from the wrong person, a crook that works for a big time mobster, Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Lonnegan doesn't take that kindly, and sends his goons to kill the conmen. Luther dies, but Hooker survives, and from that moment onwards has only two purposes: stay alive, and take revenge. Of course, Hooker will not be alone, as he will have the help of Gondorff (Paul Newman), another con artist and one of Luther's old friends.<br /><br />All in all, I firmly believe that this film is a timeless classic you shouldn't miss. Directed by George Roy Hill and with a superb cast, \\"The sting\\" is the kind of movie that surprises you till the very end. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat

0679731725|5.0|This novel is an intricate and detailed look at one man and his attempt to find happiness and fulfillment. The protagonist, Stevens, believes that to be at the pinnacle of his trade (butlering) would afford this. However, in his relentless pursuit of \\"dignity\\"- his idea of the perfect quality for a butler to possess- he denies himself any human relationships and ends up alone, baffled, and entrenched in the past. Furthermore, he is entirely reliant on instruction given from above and on the house that he runs. This is a tremendously powerful, absorbing and moving novel which I sincerely recommend.

1592401791|5.0|Geoff Emerick is one of the few Beatles insiders who never wrote a book... until now.  Happily, it's well worth the wait!  This charming, delightful memoir is packed with warmth and wit, and one can see all the self-deprecating humor in this amazing man that Elvis Costello writes about in his lyrical forward. <br /> <br />Not just witness to history in the making, Emerick was a vital part of it, helping the Beatles attain their distinct recorded sound from their earliest days through their creative peak (Revolver and Sgt. Pepper), all the way to the band's final glory, Abbey Road.  This book puts you right in the middle of those long late-night sessions, bringing to life both the fun and frustration that went into crafting such timeless tracks as Strawberry Fields Forever, A Day In The Life, and All You Need Is Love.  Even more than the technicalities -- explained here in plain English, by the way -- it is Emerick's keen insights into the complex personalities of the four bandmates and their complex interrelationships that makes this book such a gem. <br /> <br />There is NOTHING troubling about this book, as the last reviewer here alleges, but I have to say that there IS something deeply troubling about people who are so married to their preconceptions of \\"the truth\\" about Beatles history that they feel compelled to attack anyone -- even someone who was physically there at the sessions, even someone with credentials as impeccable as Geoff Emerick's -- for perceived \\"errors.\\"  Why can't they accept that they can learn something new from those who were actually there? I had the opportunity to attend an event recently at Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in which Emerick and co-author Howard Massey spoke before a live audience and freely took questions.  Not only were they both gracious and clearly extremely knowledgable, but it was apparent to me and to everyone in attendance how vivid Emerick's memories actually are, and what a positive feeling he still has about the magic of those long-ago recording sessions. <br /> <br />After the talk and Q&A session, I attended a book signing, and while Emerick was autographing my book, I casually mentioned that a reviewer on Amazon had recently alleged that he hadn't even proof-read his own book.  Emerick roared with laughter at the idea and then explained (as he does in the book) that Ringo's drum packet on the snare drum did indeed help impart a distinctive sound since it muffled the skin.  He also reiterated a clear memory of George Harrison playing bass instead of Paul on the song \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" commenting that he was impressed that Paul moved over to piano and equally impressed that George was able to swap instruments and play bass. (Who knows, maybe George could play a bit left-handed, or maybe he simply turned Paul's Hofner over, or maybe there was a right-handed bass laying around. I have no idea where that reviewer got the idea that George played acoustic guitar on the song; I don't even hear one on the track.)  I left the signing thoroughly convinced that what Geoff Emerick has given us here is a thoughtful and true rendering of his recollections of those sessions, unfiltered and unembellished.  <br /> <br />As far as dialogue is concerned, I think any intelligent reader understands that dialogue presented in memoirs, particularly of conversations that occurred decades previously, are never intended to be exactly verbatim; they are only meant to give the reader the gist of what was said.  Certainly \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" does not contain any more such dialogue than you would find in any other memoir, and there are no prolonged conversations presented here.  The bottom line is that this book is not intended as a textbook, nor is it meant to be a \\"definitive\\" accounting of Beatles history (as was the Bob Spitz book, for example), nor is it advertised as such.  It is simply one man's recounting of events as he remembers them.  Fortunately for us all, the eventsEmerick describes in these pages were not only of great historic import but provide a fascinating glimpse into the minds of creative genius, and his descriptions are both riveting and well-written.  Quite simply, this is the Beatles book we've all been waiting for -- probably the best one ever written.
B000022TSW|5.0|For a very long time, I have avoided South Park like the plague.  I couldn't see that the things they made fun of were often done in jest to point out people's hypocrisy.  It didn't help that I wasn't a fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's follow-up film Team America: World Police.  But in the past few weeks, I've begun to see the merits of South Park, and this film is hilarious and is one of the best musicals I've ever seen! <br />I don't even think I need to put the \\"this is not for kids\\" disclaimer in this review (whoops, guess I just did).  By now, I'm sure people know what South Park is and that their young children shouldn't be watching it.  If however, you let your kid see this film, it isn't the fault of the filmmakers, the theaters, or society.  Hey wait, that's what the movie is about! <br />Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman are four young kids in South Park, Colorado.  In the series, they tend to have bizarre misadventures caused by adult misunderstandings and hypocrisy.  In the film, the boys go to see a movie starring their favorite television duo, Terrence and Phillip.  Terrence and Phillip are two Canadians whose material is completely dependent upon swearing and toilet humor.  The Terrence and Phillip film is rated R (just like the South Park movie itself), and after seeing it, the kids begin imitating the duo, much to their parents' chagrin.  At first, they just start swearing more, but things escalate when Kenny accidentally sets himself on fire trying to prove to Cartman that it really is possible to light a fart on fire.  The doctors (one of whom is played by George Clooney, a fan of the show) are unable to save him, Kyle's mother organizes a militant group of mothers to blame Canada for corrupting their youths and causing Kenny's death (and to make sure that no one blames them for bad parenting). <br />On Earth, the boys try to find a way to stop their parents from going to war with Canada.  Also, they each have their own subplot.  Stan tries to prove to a girl he likes that he's political, Kyle tries to stand up to his mother, and Cartman needs to find a way to live with a newly implanted V-Chip that shocks him every time he curses.  Meanwhile in Hell, Kenny learns that Satan and his new boyfriend Saddam Hussein are poised to take over the world should Kyle's mom's war come to pass. <br />The film takes on issues of blame, censorship, racism, and war in addition to numerous others.  Not only do Matt and Trey expertly showcase their opinions, they do it through song!  The songs in the film advance the plot, tackle social issues, and parody established musicals and musical styles.  The boys sing a song about Olympic figure skater Brian Boitano which is a send-up of Disney's Newsies, while Satan sings a song reminiscent of Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid.  Oklahoma! and Les Miserables are also parodied. <br />This is a very polarizing film.  If someone is on the sides of the issues that Matt and Trey attack, they would most likely dislike the film, and anyone who doesn't like excess profanity or toilet humor should also stay away.  But if you don't mind that kind of stuff and have a good sense of humor, you will definitely enjoy this movie.

1400079179|1.0|Is there any point adding one more assessment to the 3000-plus already on this site? Probably not, but I will make a few general comments.<br /><br />It is staggering beyond belief that despite the obvious absurdity of so many of Brown's contentions to anyone with even a smattering of knowledge of ancient history or art criticism, despite the fact that numerous books have already been written showing how totally wrong it all is - despite all this, so many reviewers are saying things like \\"the research is correct\\" and \\"the book is full of historical facts\\".<br /><br />Then some add, \\"But the book is fiction\\". So it is - virtually everything it says is fiction. But the plot is totally driven by the \\"revelations\\" about Mary Magdalen and the Catholic Church that take up so many of its pages. Brown himself claims that \\"the ancient history, the secret documents, the rituals, all of this is factual.\\" If he had said that everything in the book is fiction, would it ever have become a mega-best-seller?<br /><br />The stupendous irony of this book is that Brown constantly warns against taking historical allegations as true, and yet he expects people to believe him when he alleges (with no real evidence whatsoever) that he is right and all the historians are wrong. Even more incredible is the fact that most of his readers appear to accept his statements as fact, even when you only need to look at da Vinci's paintings to see how nonsensical some of them are.<br /><br />The problem is not just that there are errors in The Da Vinci Code, but that the whole book is such a bloated mass of error that it makes the works of Joseph Goebbels look accurate by comparison.<br /><br />To take just a few of the big lies:<br /><br />1. One of Brown's central claims is that the emperor Constantine called the Council of Nicea to declare that Christ was divine because it would boost his own power, and then had a new set of gospels written to replace the old Gnostic gospels that were not sympathetic to his cause. The facts are: a) The claim is ridiculous, because the Christians were a politically insignificant minority in the empire and there was no indication that they would ever be anything else, and in any case, how was belief in a divine saviour going to affect his power base? b) There is massive historical evidence that belief in the divinity of Christ was virtually universal prior to Nicea. c) The first well-known Christian to deny the divinity of Christ was Arius in the early fourth century. d) The Council of Nicea was called precisely to deal with the problem of Arius and his followers, which was the greatest crisis the Church had ever faced, though Brown conveniently neglects to mention it. e) The contents of the New Testament, which had been debated for a long time, had been pretty much decided (as identical to the New Testament we know today) by about the middle of the third century. The Council of Nicea did not even discuss it. f) Constantine himself played no part in the Council and certainly did not propose what it should decide. He left those details to the bishops. g) The Christians of the time were fiercely proud of their faith, and thousands of them went to their death rather than deny any aspect of it. They would never have tolerated Constantine or anyone else tampering with the sacred books of scripture, let alone rewriting them; yet there is no evidence of any complaints about Constantine's actions. h) The four accepted Gospels, far from replacing the Gnostic gospels, predated them by a couple of centuries. In fact, one of the reasons why the Gnostic gospels were not accepted was that they had been composed too recently. i) Ironically, Constantine himself, rather than trying to get the Church to accept the divinity of Christ, later incurred the censure of the Church for siding with the Arians.<br /><br />2. As for the absurd claim that Mary Magdalen was married to Christ, a claim which is absolutely central to the book, Brown proposes noevidence for it at all, apart from the quote from the Gospel of Philip which says that Magdalen was the \\"companion of the Saviour\\"  and that he used to kiss her on the mouth; this, despite the fact that the original text of the Gospel of Philip is damaged and merely says \\"companion of the...\\" and also omits the word \\"mouth\\". And Brown claims that any Aramaic scholar would tell you that \\"companion\\" means \\"spouse\\"; true, this is one possible meaning, but what would he make of Mat. 23:30, in which Jesus quotes the Pharisees as saying \\"If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been companions of theirs in shedding the blood of the prophets\\"? And why speak of Aramaic scholars, when the Gospel of Philip was written in Coptic? Brown does not point out that the Second Apocalypse of James says that Jesus used to kiss James on the mouth; for to the Gnostics, the kiss was not sexual but a symbol of the transfer of knowledge. Nor does he mention the many Gnostic works that undermine his concept of the \\"sacred feminine\\", e.g. the best-known Gnostic work of all, the Gospel of Thomas, has Jesus saying of Mary: \\"I shall guide her to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every female who makes herself male will enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\\" As a result of his highly selective quotations, Brown is able to make the ridiculous claim that the Catholic Church suppressed all this information because it was opposed to sex. Like so many of his claims, this is not merely false but the very reverse of the truth.

And Brown claims that any Aramaic scholar would tell you that \\"companion\\" means \\"spouse\\"; true, this is one possible meaning, but what would he make of Mat. 23:30, in which Jesus quotes the Pharisees as saying \\"If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been companions of theirs in shedding the blood of the prophets\\"?

014305760X|5.0|I loved this hilarious yet touching book. There are three narrators, each of whom does an amazing job of narrating their characters. Their voices are distinct and different enough that it was always easy to tell who was talking if I started up the audiobook in the middle of a chapter, and the narrators did an excellent job of capturing the essence of each character.<br /><br />I found myself laughing out loud often during this book, despite the dark humor and difficult topics. Nick Hornby has a way of making anything funny, even things that I'd feel inappropriate laughing about in real life. The story itself was satisfying as well - Hornby doesn't resort to cliches or easy solutions, but I didn't feel at any point like I was left hanging emotionally either, which takes skill.<br /><br />I'd absolutely recommend this book in unabridged audio CD form. The narration made it stand out among other audiobooks and the story was funny and satisfying. (May not be appropriate for young teens though, as there is a lot of swearing - followed each time, of course, by an apology to the tender-eared Maureen!)
B00006J3WH|3.0|Reviewing this piece is a bit difficult-- I'm going to be straight: neither Joss Whedon's songwriting nor the majority of the performances are soaked in originality, depth, or (in the case particularly of many of the vocals), talent.  But for fans of the TV show and the episode \\"Once More With Feeling\\", this is probably a worthwhile endeavor. <br /> <br />Evidentally, Joss Whedon got this idea to do a musical, a lifelong dream of his, and while lacking formal training as a musician,  he plunks around a bit on piano and/or guitar and managed to put this together-- a piece that's as much a homage to Sondheim, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Gershwin and Jonathan Larson.  The actors on 'Buffy' are possessing of a mixed bag of singing voices-- a couple of them clearly came from a theater background and are fairly well adjusted to this situation (Anthony Stewart Head, James Marsters and Amber Benson as well as guest star Hinton Battle) whereas some of the cast (notably Sarah Michelle Gellar) clearly have little background in singing.    <br /> <br />The net result is it's a pretty mixed, most of it is entertaining, goofy musical stuff, traipsing from the kitchy, overdone melodramatic sing-speak narrations to Rent-like harmonies and dueling vocals.  In the end, it works out to be a lot of fun, but evaluating it from a musical perspective is somewhat belittling its value.  I'm not listening to this for brilliant music (although the \\"Under Your Spell / Waiting\\" reprise is quite fantatic and \\"Walk Through the Fire\\" is clever enough, even if it wears its influences way up on its sleeve, to get past sloppy vocal harmonies) or outstanding performances-- although there's quite a few mostly because of individual talent (Marsters' performance on \\"Rest in Peace\\" and virtually everything that Battle sings, including standout track \\"What You Feel\\") or extraordinarily dedicated performances by the singers (Emma Caufield and Nicholas Brendan's duet \\"I'll Never Tell\\").  I'm listening to it because my workday has been way too stressful and I need something goofy before I charge into a meeting. <br /> <br />So if you're a fan, yeah, you'll want this, go get it.  Everyone else, watch the show first.  If it converts you, this is worthwhile.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx star in this movie about the life of a marine and his journey through boot camp and into the fighting of the first Gulf War.  Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a twenty year old raw recruit who joined the Marines because, in his words, he got lost on the way to college.  Upon arriving in boot camp, Swoff witnesses some other Marines with a homemade USMC brand.  Soon, Swoff is corralled by the other Marines, thrown to the ground, and the brand is brought to his leg.  However, Swoff ends up passing out.  Upon waking, he realizes that he wasn't branded.  Troy (Peter Sasarsgaard) informs Swoff that he must earn the brand.  The two soon become friends. <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx stars as Staff Sergeant Sykes, a career soldier who is in command of an eight-man sniper team.  There are four spotters and four shooters.  Swoff is chosen as a shooter, while Troy becomes Swoff's spotter.  The group trains endlessly until all the members of the team are experts at their craft.  During their training, the Iraqis invade Kuwait, and Swoff's unit is sent to the Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield. <br /> <br />Upon arriving in the Gulf, the men find themselves with a little too much time on their hands.  Time is spent by writing letters or playing football.  In one instance, their football gets them into trouble, as Sgt. Sykes forces the men to put on their chemical warfare suits and play an entire game of football while members of the press look on.   <br /> <br />After being in the Gulf region for several months with no action besides their own training, the war finally began in January, 1991.  When the land campaign began, Swoff's unit was thrust into the fighting.  Swoff and Troy were chosen to take out two Iraqi soldiers who were in a control tower.  Making their way cautiously over the hot desert sand, they arrive at the perfect shooting site, 900 yards from their target.  Having been given clearance to shoot, Swoff prepares to pull the trigger on his sniper rifle.  However, just before he can shoot, another officer bursts through the door and informs Swoff and Troy that an airstrike is going to take out the tower.  Despite all of their training and time spent in the Gulf, Swoff never got to fire his rifle in anger. <br /> <br />After the war, the group returned to the United States to many well-wishers who welcomed them home.  One poignant moment at the end of the movie shows a Vietnam vet jump into Swoff's company's bus and shake hands with the men while telling them that they did a great job.  One can sense that the Vietnam vet wished he would have received the same type of welcome twenty years earlier.  Swoff's war lasted 4 days and 4 hours. <br /> <br />This is a very powerful movie.  It compares closely to Stanley Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".  Both movies were told through the eyes of a single soldier.  The accuracy of life in the desert is apparent throughout the movie, especially the parts where the soldiers are forced to deal with their boredom.  The battle scenes are authentic as well, including the massive wreckage caused by the A-10 \\"Warthog\\" tank busters against Iraqi vehicles. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie.  The acting, especially by Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllenhaal, is very good, the combat sequences are realistic, and the story is compelling.  Watch this very good movie and experience life in the Marines during Operation Desert Storm through the eyes of a Marine sniper.
0441007015|3.0|Die Geschichte ist eine Art Kriminalroman, gesucht wird der Holiday Man, der nur an Feiertagen mordet. Batman, Harvey Dent und Commissioner Gordon verbünden sich zu diesem Zwecke und ermitteln gemeinsam. <br /> <br /> <br />Der Comicband ist mächtig, rund 370 Seiten, und im Großen und Ganzen spannend, besonders die letzten Kapitel über. Jedoch besitzt er auch seine Längen. Viele Handlungsstränge sind am Ende noch unbeantwortet, und auch wenn ich das normalerweise nichtmal schlecht finde, bei diesem Comic stört es ein wenig, weil man doch schon wissen will warum bestimme Personen hier und dort waren. <br /> <br /> <br />Der Zeichenstil ist geschmackssache, mir persönlich gefiel er nicht besonders. Alles ist sehr düster und farbarm, wohl angelehnt an Noir Filme.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis is angry here and sometimes the words are just plain silly and grating. But her voice, it is a musical instrument that is unduplicated in the catalog and here it is matched with melodies and rhythms that both command and obey the voice at the same time, a marriage of songwriting and vocals. <br /> <br />Like a fine wine, there are traces of other fruits and vegetables here.  The Rolling Stones, the Who, the Beatles... <br /> <br />Jagged Little Pill - At first I was disappointed by the guitar jamming  middle, it didn't seem to fit in this otherwise brilliant song, but then suddenly it resolves itself in Alanis \\"hooo-oold it down...\\" and its just perfect. Some of the endings of the songs on this album would have benefitted if Alanis had just kept quiet and this is one of them.    <br /> <br />One Hand in My Pocket - Really fine bass guitar on this song.   <br /> <br />It's hard to listen to the whole album all the way through, her voice is just too powerful.  It never ceases to amaze though, she gets it all out here. There are some songs I just don't like, but others are in my view among the best rock songs ever. <br /> <br />
B00005KHEU|4.0|E.L.O's discovery (1979) is a vintage album. It is one of their earliest albums, and as much as is it a fantastic one, it is not their best. If you want to hear their real masterpieces, take a look at \\"Time\\", \\"Out of the blue\\" or \\"Eldorado\\". <br />Nevertheless, this one is pretty good, even a lot more than that. It features a lot of hits later on to be legends, and to hear it in a proper stereo can be just about it.  <br />Don't get me wrong, the only reason I rated it four stars and not five is because I think there are E.L.O's ablbums which deserve the meximum score for their genius quality. Besides that, this album is a fantastic one, and unquestionably one of their best ones.  <br />I would suggest you to try listen to this one, not for its hits, not for its quality (compare to 1970's recordings) but for its genius level of music, which you can always find in one of the finest E.L.O's albums.  <br />Very well recommended. Enjoy !
B000C65Z1G|4.0|This is a terrific example of shaky material made good by outstanding execution. Fiennes, Weisz, and their supporting cast are all at the top of the game, and the photography is nothing short of breathtaking.  <br /> <br />I couldn't, however, take the plot that seriously in terms of its political intrigue. Don't get me wrong. I'm not naive enough to think that Africa isn't being mistreated by western powers and corporations, but to really function as commentary, I have to believe that the pharmacuticle companies have something to gain by their questionable activities.  <br /> <br />**SPOILERS** The Constant Gardener has the drug companies spending billions of dollars to test a TB cure they already know is deadly. They have word that TB is going to wipe out the world within the next few years (impossible to predict), and they somehow stand to make a fortune by not spending a few million dollars to make sure they don't wipe out their customers when the drug goes on the market. Therefore, they bribe African governments to approve human testing they plan to discard anyway and organize the murder of our heros, the supersluth diplomats.  <br /> <br />In another film, these absurd details would've warranted my overall disapproval, but the focus of the story is not what the bad guys do. It's about how their actions affect the broader interests of the people involved. As Fiennes entangles himself deeper and deeper into the situation, he becomes more and more fascinating, and more and more helpless.  <br /> <br />The same goes for Weisz, but to a lesser extent. Her character is such an outspoken liberal that she can barely function in a social setting without getting worked into a frenzy at anyone who disagrees. I've seen this done by both sides of the political spectrum, and it's a great way to alienate people who could potentially share your concerns. There is a scene which suggests that the filmmakers understand this, but the character never seems to figure it out. I haveto admit, I was very amused when we first see her in Africa in the middle of a huge crowd with a black toddler in her arms. I wondered if she made a habit of carrying strange children in crowds. <br /> <br />Anyway, a great piece of cinematic technique daunted only by some very big holes in logic. Kudos to Meirelles and the cast, but John le Carr?'s on notice.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|Great movie. Some of the best special effects you will ever see. Great acting by Naomi Watts.... The script wasn't as good as it could have been, but it's a very powerful emotional film and that sort of makes up for a great deal of that.    Some people complain about the first half being so long. I personally don't see the problem.... When you get into a good script combined with such an emotional film, you usally don't want it to end. The naysayers seem to just have a short attention span.    Not alot of B movie cheese here thank god. This movie shows a good, but brief love between King and Watts. It reflects how some real relationships can work... Despite him making a huge mess and destroying everything, she is able to the good in King as he shows he will go to any lengths to keep her out of harms way. And the relationship between the two really pulls you into the film.    The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because the script could have been a touch better and we get basically nothing for extra features.    That last reviewer \\"Two thumbs up your butt\\"     Wow! That's really dumb. How old are you, 12? WHo the heck over the age of 12 says that?
B000AU9UYM|2.0|Like everyone of us, I grew up with Batman. It has been an enduring image. I remember wearing a towel for a cape, and much to the chagrin of mother, charging through the house and jumping off couches, imitating Batman, when I was younger. <br /> <br />I am suprised to say the least, the proper choice of words would be appalled, shocked and angered to see the way Batman was depicted in this movie. <br /> <br />Mark you, the story line is not too bad, and stellar performances by Michael Cain, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are truly enjoyable. But the main character, Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman was played by arguably the worst actor in present day Cinema. <br /> <br />Christian Bale has a speech impediment and an acting impediment. That guy couldn't act convincingly for 10 seconds to save his life. He looks like one of those moronic farm hands, the kind at whom you throw an insult, and they say \\"Oh yeah...\\" and pause for like forever, are lost for a comeback and then say something lame. <br /> <br />You know the kind? Incredibly dumb, with a jaw jutting out like a neanderthal...?  <br /> <br />And Katie holmes is equally bad. Having a cherubic face is not an acceptable compromise for the skills required to act in a movie. Through out the movie, they concentrate on head shots of her. The viewer is supposed to just admire her mug... I think not, we came to watch a bloody movie. And then she has that crooked smile... it looked so silly after some time. She just didnt have the personality or presence required to pull off a crooked smile, let alone a role as that of a Batman romantic interest.  <br /> <br />Nicole kidman and now Katie Holmes... what has the world come to!!! <br /> <br />The story line, as I said, wasnt too bad. But after a while, I was just sitting and watching Christian murder the movie with his absolutely terrible acting. I grimaced each time he just stood there, unable to emote or deliver his dialogues.  <br /> <br />CHRISTIAN BALE SUCKED!! <br />I am deeply anguished and scarred by this movie. If it was possible, I would consider filing a law suit against the makers of this movie for scarring the image of a hero that we have all cherished for countless generations. <br /> <br />I gave it 2 stars, because of Freeman, Neeson and Cain. <br />This movie sucks, dont pay to watch it. <br />KL
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a fan of the movies (sci-fi in particular) but passed on \\"Serenity\\" (the feature film based on \\"Firefly\\") when it was in the theaters. I heard it was based on a cancelled TV show, so I figured I wouldn't \\"get it.\\" When \\"Serenity\\" came out on video, I decided it was time to have a look. Long story short -- I REALLY enjoyed it, and then did the next logical thing: I decided to check out the TV series that led up to it. That was a good decision on my part; a very good one. <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" is about a crew of good-hearted space pirates several hundred years in the future that are just trying to make ends meet. They have a ship, the Serenity, and pass their time going from planet to planet on the \\"outer rim\\" of civilization in the galaxy, picking up \\"jobs\\" that pay (i.e., stealing) and trying to avoid Federation authorities and the Reavers (some great bad guys). <br /> <br />Ok, so how is it? In a word, \\"Firefly\\" is fantastic -- mesmerizing (ok, two words). I couldn't stop watching it, one episode after another. ALL of the episodes are great; there ain't a clunker in the bunch. I can't remember being this hooked by a TV series since the \\"Sopranos\\" came out on video. I love the futuristic setting and the glimpses of how our civilization has progressed, the fleshed-out 3-D characters, the sharp dialogue, and the interesting situations that the crew finds itself in.  <br /> <br />I have no idea how this show could have been cancelled. It could only have been done by someone looking at numbers, not someone who had actually watched the show. <br /> <br />The characters are especially good -- the kind you wish you could spend more time with and get to know even better when you are done watching. The cast works extremely well together and that's was one of the primary things that drew me in -- you can tell there were no big egos in the group and that everyone was having fun. If you watch the extras (for the series, and with \\"Serenity\\"), you will hear the same messagefrom them directly. It sounds like they had a blast, and it shows. <br /> <br />It's just an added bonus that they're all easy on the eyes. You probably won't have heard of anyone associated with this series (except maybe Joss Whedon, the auteur, or perhaps Ron Glass, the actor from \\"Barney Miller\\" back in the 1970s), but you might be inclined to look them up on the internet after you finish watching.  <br /> <br />They are all great, but Nathan Fillion stands out as the Captain, \\"Mal\\" (short for Malcolm, although I wouldn't be surprised if its a double entendre). He is simply a great actor, and I can't wait to see where he turns up next. Two other favorites of mine are Summer Glau and Morena Baccarin, excellent actresses and beautiful to boot. <br /> <br />The scripts are excellent too -- lots of word-play humor and, just as importantly, the characters say things that you would expect people to say in their situations. The slow-burn flirting between two main characters is handled particularly well. <br /> <br />In case you think I've suspended all critical thinking and become an unthinking sci-fi zealot, let me pick a few nits as well. First, technology does not seem to have progressed very far in many ways from what it is now. In particular, it seems odds that people ae still pretty much firing off 20th century guns when the shooting starts. Second, there is a fair amount of violence in many episodes and a fair number of people die. A couple times the three main \\"fighting\\" characters seemed to take death and killing people a little too much in stride. On the other hand, they *are*  essentially pirates or bandits, life is cheap, and they do abide by a code that basically requires them to do everything possible to avoid killing people. But if someone tries to kill them first...    <br /> <br />That's really about it when it comes to things that made me stop and think about for a minute...but those thoughts pass quickly and then I come back to thinking what a greatshow this is.   <br /> <br />So who should buy this? I would recommend it to *everyone* except those who might have a problem with the violence, which gets heavy at times. You know who you are. There is a little swearing, but it's all in Chinese! (it will make perfect sense when you watch it). As a parent of two young children (ages 6 and 8) who are just getting into Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc., I briefly considered watching it with my kids, but the show is really intended for adults. Someday, though.... <br /> <br />You don't see many products on Amazon that average a 5-star rating, especially when 2500 people have their say. You don't need to be a sci-fi fan, you just need to be able to appreciate high-quality entertainment when you see it. As you will see on Joss Whedon's humorous introduction to the series, this whole project was a labor of love. That comes through in every single episode. <br /> <br />So, why are you still reading this? :)
0142000663|5.0|This was required reading in HS which, of course, I didn't do :0<br /><br />25 years later I decided to read many of the literary classics that I faked my way through.  'Grapes of Wrath' took me about 100 pages to get locked into.  Steinbeck's writing style was difficult for me to digest at first.  Once I got hooked, I went back a re-read the first 100 pages.  At 500 pages it took me a couple of weeks to get through.  But at every sequential reading session I found myself covering more and more pages until I read the final 100 pages in one sitting.<br /><br />Great story based upon anecdotal evidence that probably played out in many variations, thousands of times for thousands of 'Oakie' families after the great depression and dust bowl periods.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Sharon Stone and SLIVER made a lot of sense after BASIC INSTINCT.  It gave her a chance to be the hunted instead of the hunter, and also promised a whole lot of male nudity this time around instead of her being revealed so much. Eszterhas was back on board as a screenwriter, and the film was designed to be a sexual thriller about modern voyeurism with video cameras.  SLIVER the book was not Ira Levin's best novel (cheesy fun but nothing classic), and I found myself not minding this movie deviates from it.  Anyone who's read it knows the heroine's cat saves the day in one of the silliest climaxes ever.  So don't worry about the book being better or worse with this one.<br /><br />The production ran in to problems especially with the ending originally planned inside a VOLCANO of all things.  Test audiences hated it, and so reshoots were quickly done.  Eszterhas was not happy with the changes to his original script, and some new scenes made the actors seem a little less prepared and rushed.  Billy Baldwin chickened out on full frontal nudity planned for his character, and demanded his most revealing shots be cut from the final movie.  Despite any changes, the movie turns out to be entertaining fluff that never quite seems as kinky as it could be.  It's still a whole lot of fun, and worth it for Stone fans.  There are still some interesting ideas here.<br /><br />This DVD contains a European cut with more nudity and prolonged sex scenes.  For the most part you'll see much more of Baldwin, since Stone carefully handled her nudity this time around (she learned quick after BASIC INSTINCT).  There are no extras, and that's a real shame.  I wanted to see the real ending, but no such luck.  Also no trailers on the disc because they included moments from the original ending and not the new version.  And oddly enough a Lords of Acid song is removed from the DVD's soundtrack.  But at least we get it bigger, longer, and uncut at a reasonable price.<br /><br />You like to watch, right?to watch, right?
B000B8QEZG|3.0|With each progressive Madonna album, it is hard not to see that she is running out of new innovative material. She seems, at the moment, to be clinging to the music scene in desperation. This, however, is inevitable after the commercial flop of \\"American Life\\". I respect Madonna for her determination to stay in the public eye. Unfortunately this sometimes means she rushes an album and delivers a so-so album. I really believe it was time for a five year break for Madonna after \\"American Life\\" so she could recover for a better, less panic driven album. Instead of doing this Madge decided to deliver us a set of songs that are reminiscent of her earlier days with some beats reminiscent of her later albums. The result is a catchy set of songs, even if not a hundred percent inventive.<br /><br /> The album starts with \\"Hung Up\\", a catchy dancy number that would be at home in the club, though may not be that great to listen to at home on your own. Madonna's voice sounds somewhat thin. She takes less risks than ever on vocal production during this album, a drastic change from \\"American Life\\". \\"Get Together\\" is an extremely catchy number that will possibly be remembered as one of Madonna's best. The dance production is fun and there is good focus. \\"Sorry\\" is where the album starts to slip. The production here sounds repetitive and too like the previous two songs. The problem is that the tempo on this album doesn't really change. The lyrics to \\"Sorry\\" are boring, though they take backseat to the music. \\"I Love New York\\" is a contestant for the worst written song of the year. Madonna sings \\"Other cities always make me mad/ Other places always make me sad/ No other city ever made me glad except New York/ I Love New York\\". How lazily could you write a song? Though there is plenty of filler on the album Madonna does give some excellent tracks such as \\"Jump\\" \\"How High\\" and \\"Push\\". In fact the last five songs except maybe \\"Isaac\\" are brilliant. It really is the middle of this album and safe vocal production that drag this album from excellence to being only good.<br /><br /> This effort from Madonna is enjoyable to a certain degree. Since the album tracks flow into each other it really does feel like one collective piece. The focus is therefore good, even if there is nothing hugely different. The good points of the album are truly excellent whereas the bad points of the album are extremely boring. Maybe next time Madonna would be better off putting in a few ballads. She also takes herself far too seriously and this is a very selfish album. Buy at your own will, just be aware that it may dissapoint some tastes.<br /><br /> Download: \\"Get Together\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Push\\".bum and safe vocal production that drag this album from excellence to being only good. <br /> <br /> This effort from Madonna is enjoyable to a certain degree.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|Eli Roth further hones his visionary style of horror with HOSTEL, a buddy flick gone awry! Three travelers seek out sinful solitude in foreign territory and soon fall prey to a deceitful web of underground entrepreneurs. Unlike most horror films of the day, there is no damsel in distress... unless you count the guys. The whores who con them are as evil as they come, though, and beg little forgiveness for their deeds.<br />Those who realize how disjointed the process of film-making can be will appreciate what Roth has achieved in both CABIN FEVER and HOSTEL. The mood and tone of his films seamlessly shift from one extreme to the next as the movie progresses. There is generally no filler material and the pace is swift and relentless. Then he ends it with a horrifically satisfying blow to the chrome. Initially, HOSTEL it is a gradual descent into the unknown. Then, suddenly the floor drops out and you are faced with the grim matters at hand. Without giving details, I will say that this movie delivers on the gore (though you can ALWAYS have more gore), the disturbing sounds and images, the nudity and the explicit content. But it is also very entertaining, has a good story with good acting and, at times, is really funny. Anyone with a sick sense of a humor and a love for horror films is going to enjoy HOSTEL. And for those of you comparing this to porn? There's a couple fully frontal shots and several breasts - but nothing i'd consider pornographic in this day and age. Lighten up (:

B00004RJ74|2.0|The only thing is this film worth watching is Clooney.  He actually showed he could act here, and went on to make much better films.  This is really just a vanity project for Tarantino, who proves that ego doesn't make you a great actor.  This was made in 1996, when Tarantino (and Rodriguez, to a lesser extent) were movie \\"rock stars\\".  They could do whatever they wanted.  Quentin decided that he wanted to write and act in a film, and he shows he can't act for &%$%&.  He is really bad here.  His script is really boring, filled with cliches, and just used as an excuse to show carnage and gore at the end of the film.  Lewis and Kietel just seem to be going through the motions here, and Rodriguez's direction is very uninspiring.  Avoid, avoid.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and \\"The Matrix\\" are one and the same.  Well, okay, maybe that's not entirely true, but they both display Christian narrative parallels that have sparked interest amongst Christians across the world.  However, though the Christian themes in \\"The Matrix\\" are clear, their impact is debatable as several other religions could make claims that \\"The Matrix\\" represents their views and influences.  The same cannot be said of C.S. Lewis's wonderful novel, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  Lewis paints a wonderful parable of the Biblical story that can be enjoyed not only by children but adults alike.  As a young adult who hardly remember the story from when my mom read it to me as a young child, I found the genius in Lewis's work. <br />     <br />     For those of you who are unfamiliar with the story, four children are evacuated from wartime London to stay with a professor.  The children soon find a wardrobe that leads to a magical land called Narnia, where they meet talking animals who speak of a ruling lion that is coming to save Narnia from the White Witch.  They join forces with their new friends and this great lion, Aslan.  Though one of the children, Edmund, turns against his siblings to join the White Witch early in the story, Aslan's Christ-like actions (which I will not go in to full detail for fear of ruining the story) save Edmund and break the witch's magic.  The tale is still powerful if the Christian connection is not made, but for those who recognize Christ in Aslan's actions, the book is all the more powerful. <br />      <br />     To better understand Lewis the writer and his goals for writing this story, specifically its Christian messages, I read relevant excerpts from The Christian World of C.S. Lewis by Clyde Kilby and The C.S. Lewis Encyclopedia by Colin Duriez.  Duriez says, \\"Lewis's delight in God's creation was the heart of his fantasy writing.\\"  He also adds that Lewis \\"enabl[es] people in our modern world to see again the meaning of God's reality.\\"  Kilby believes that while Lewis wanted to \\"tell a good tale,\\" he was also motivated to \\"suggest analogies of the Christian scheme of things.\\"  These analogies don't stop with this book. The series ends with Aslan receiving the children after they pass away.  He takes care of them and leads them on everlastingly exciting adventures, symbolic of the eternal life in Heaven. <br />      <br />     Personally, I think this series is so popular because of these faith-based messages.  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe book offers an easier, alternative read for those who struggle with reading segments of the Bible.  It reinforces the strength and sacrifice of God's love in Christian readers, all the while smoothly chronicling an enjoyable tale.  While I could not fully appreciate Lewis's cunning use of symbolism and teachings in this story as a young child, I now think even more highly of Mr. Lewis.  Yet, I will never forget my Mom reading me this book many years ago, and I will certainly do the same to my children when the time comes.  This book is a masterpiece that transcends the children's story category and speaks to all people, young and old.    <br />
B00005JOWR|5.0|This is a very funny movie that will appeal to smart viewers.  I'm sure you've heard that it's a satire of the tobacco industry, in which a \\"spokesperson\\" for big tobacco (played by Aaron Eckhart) twists the words of others, scoffs at science and shows not a whiff of conscience.  He appears on talk shows and wins over skeptical audiences.  He's constantly spinning the truth, always grabbing at a chance to defend cigarettes and smokers.  He's very good at his job...mostly because he's VERY likeable. <br /> <br />The fun thing about the film is that Eckhart makes his character sympathetic.  His nerve is flabbergasting and admirable (while he spouts the most ridiculous things, he oozes sincerity.  We know he doesn't believe his spiel, but he sure sells it).  He has a great relationship with his teenage son.  He's whip-smart.  He's funny, but not unbelievably so.   <br /> <br />The movie is a satire of many things.  Some of the best jabs are taken at the expense of \\"big\\" Hollywood, personified by Rob Lowe as a movie-mogul in a kimono, who helps Eckhart seal a deal on some product-placement in a big-budget sci-fi movie.  Lowe is priceless...just seeing him brings on laughs.  It also satirizes \\"Birkenstock-wearing\\" liberal politicians (embodied in William Macy).  There are jabs at the alcohol and gun industries.  It's really more about now brazenly industries, politicians, Hollywood, individuals (you name it) will spin lies into truth to help their causes. <br /> <br />If you like satires, this will be a treat...whether you smoke or not.  And the movie has moments of real power (the scenes when Eckhart approaches a dying Marlboro Man [wonderful Sam Elliott] with what amounts to a bribe is chilling), plus moments of warmth...such as the scenes between Eckhart and his son, who is trying to get a handle on what dad does for a living.   <br /> <br />Everyone is great.  J.K. Simmons (a real favorite of mine) doing a spin on his character from Spiderman...just better.  Robert Duvall in a small but fun role.  Katie Holmes.  Maria Bello.  William Macy.  Cameron Bright. Sam Ellliott.  And especially Eckhart, who has found a perfect role.  While he was brilliant in IN THE COMPANY OF MEN...he was also VERY easy to despise.  Here, while his character's actions are quite despicable...he is charming, handsome, smart, well-dressed and vulnerable.  I hope people see the film and start appreciating this guy more. <br /> <br />It wasn't a often a laugh-out-loud film.  It's humor evokes smiles, chuckles and knowing \\"ah-ha's.\\"  There's no slapstick.  But there is the pleasant feeling throughout that you are in the hands of skillful artists who are making a point while thoroughly entertaining you.  I highly recommend the movie! <br />
B00000IMTH|5.0|I had a dream back in '78 in which I was at a concert talking with none other than Ritchie Blackmore. We were sitting there in row 10, passing a doobie back and forth, and he was telling me about his band Rainbow, of which I never heard of. <br /> <br />I told a guy at work, and he just happened to have a cassette tape of the newly-released album \\"long live rock 'n roll\\". Needless to say, I became a huge,huge fan of Ronnie James Dio. I got all of his albums exxcept for the Elf days. I also have an autographed picture of RJD on my den wall.  <br /> <br />This album is still my favorite RJD album of all time, maybe tied with his live \\"Intermission\\" album. The album has a somewhat medieval theme to it, in line with his first two Rainbow albums. RJD can jam on \\"Long Live Rock n Roll\\" and one of his favorite concert opening songs \\"Kill the King\\", can soften up on the ballet \\" Rainbow Eyes\\", and belt out alot of power with \\"Gates of Babylon\\". <br /> <br />Ritchie Blackmore was one of the greatest guitarists of all time, but was always tinkering with his band and kept pulling out pieces of the puzzle which fit in perfectly fine. After RJD left, me made so many changes that the band wound up sounding like a bad garage band. If he had stuck with RJD and the late-great Cozy Powell and Jimmy Bain I think the band would have eventually struck gold. <br /> <br />Rainbow's first three albums and the fourth live album are all true classics, and are always in the front on my record collection. RJD you are a God!!!
B000002BBY|5.0|What's The Story Morning Glory was Oasis's second album, released only a year after their breakthrough album Definitely Maybe in 1995.    More than 10 years later, Morning Glory is still an outstanding rock album that would sound cool blasting out of your car speakers at high volume.    Noel Gallagher, the band's songwriter, guitarist and occasional vocalist, has written some of the greatest songs of the 90's. While Liam Gallagher, Noel's younger brother, has proven that he's one of the best lead vocalists in rock history.     On Morning Glory, the band's finest of the list of classics are featured: the foot stomping and soulful Roll With It, the elusive ballad and Oasis's most famous song Wonderwall, the poppy She's Electric, the soulful Hey Now, the hauntingly beautiful Cast No Shadow, the stadium rockers and fan favorites Don't Look Back In Anger and Morning Glory, and the epical Champagne Supernova.     It's no surprise that What's The Story Morning Glory has sold an estimate of 19 million copies worldwide to date. Oasis's raw sound and attitude makes the album a confrontational statement to the world that rock is back and it's bigger and better than ever....well, since The Beatles, of course.    Recommended    Asonst so vernachlässigten alten Damen werden in diesem Film auch schön hervorgehoben, allen voran die unnachamliche und immer noch umwerfende Shirley McLaine in einer engagierten Rolle.  <br />Das Ende des Films kommt fast zu plötzlich, wohl weil man gar nicht mehr weg möchte von diesen Leuten und ihrer Geschichte. Zumindest wird man als Zuschauer mit einem überwältigenden Gefühl zurückgelassen.   <br /> <br />
B000EGCITG|4.0|\\"I'm Not Dead\\" appears after 2003's commercial misfire, but progressive \\"Try This!\\".  P!nk still manages to raise eyebrows based on her talent and opinion itself.  Already, this has become one of the most talked about albums of 2006, & seems to have alleviated the commericial doldrum she experienced in 2003.<br /><br />P!nk vocally still holds an interesting space.  Somewhere between a Janis Joplin growl & Pat Benatar belt, she manages to inject each song with her own brand of soulful crooning.  The number that really demonstrates this is \\"Who Knew\\".<br /><br />A sparkly, yet somber song that recalls a lover who alternates between the spot of former friend & lover.  P!nk brings across the confusion & passion that a subject like this would bring quite well. Also, the ghost cut at the end of the album, where P!nk sings with her father on a Vietnam tribute is vocal highlight.<br /><br />Musically, there is a bit more polish than \\"Try This!\\". Not to say that there wasn't a polish with that project, but it seems that this record is a bit more connective in it's musical presentation. Songs that would bleed into one another reveal themselves on further listens.  \\"'Cuz I Can\\" & \\"U + Ur Hand\\" both ressurect the \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" era P!nk with urban understones, but the more rock flavored directions keeps things, interesting.<br /><br />Then lyrically we have the most interesting aspect of the LP. \\"Stupid Girls\\", the lead single with guest adlibs by rapper Molecules is an infectious slice, of humorous, but stinging pop commentary on an era of uninspired celebrities.  Many have accused P!nk of attacking these women, yet some view her to be no more worse than those she assailed with the song. I'd disagree. P!nk may be a popstar, but she isn't a stupid popstar. She has a voice, in a time, when many do not. There are those who feel that unless you have their \\"indie cred\\", you can't have a voice.  It is refreshing to see someone being honest that money, while a factor in their art, isn't the dominating factor. Okay, she makes a ironic song about her cash, but it's more humorous than anything. Does that make what she said anyless true?<br /><br />I find it interesting that we have the anti-war piece, \\"Dear Mr. President\\" featuring the Indigo Girls , done rather quietly than in her predictable loud fashion. Subtle, touching, & pensive all at once.  It sounds like something someone would say, if they just walked up to & talked to the President.<br /><br />Overall, \\"I'm Not Dead\\" proves that P!nk has the chops to be thought-provoking, yet appeal to a wide-adueince based on her talent & charismatic wit. While in my mind not as strong as \\"Try This!\\", though more uniform, it shows her moving forward, & keeping an eye on her past.<br /><br />Highly Recommend!or.

0062502182|4.0|This is a fairly good book that talks about man's destiny and fullfillment in life.  <br /> <br />I don't like how the translator used the phrase 'Personal Legend' rather than the word 'destiny'.  <br /> <br />Overall a good book with a great message.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This was truly a hidden gem! Visually stunning, a beautiful touching story and some wonderful acting. Ukranian born Eugene Hutz was an excellent choice to play Alex, the \\"tour guide\\" of this movie. 33 year-old Hutz's only prior film credits were a movie \\"short\\" and a documentary in 2004 (he is better known as the singer, lyricist and visionary of the acclaimed gypsy punk rock band 'Gogol Bordello'). This comedy/drama will keep you fascinated for the entire 105 minutes. The deleted scenes are also very enjoyable but would have been a bit \\"overboard\\" on the comedic side. Elijah Wood is very good as the solemn, google-eyed American who embarks on this journey through the beautiful Ukranian country side along with Alex, Alex's Grandfather & their dog \\"Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.\\". As critics \\"Ebert & Roeper\\" reported on this movie, \\"Two Thumbs Up\\" (Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars).<br /><br />This movie begins in goofiness and ends in silence and memory. One of the best movies of the past year.
B00000DQSS|5.0|Kate Bush's music up to this release had been a traditional 'girl and a piano' sound, with simple songs and no real experimentation. However, in this album she started to dabble further into the unknown territory that she would eventually fully explore in \\"The Dreaming\\" and in parts of \\"Hounds Of Love\\", this said she still kept the heirlooms of \\"The Kick Inside\\" and \\"Lionheart\\" intact. \\"Never For Ever\\" is perhaps one of the more interesting albums in Kate's catalogue because it is the first point in which she changed her style and voice.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Babooshka\\", a #1 hit in Australia and peaking at #5 in the UK. The song has a dark feel to it, a little bit avant-garde at times and has a catchy, commercial hook. I like the background chanting also.<br /><br />\\"Delius (Song Of Summer)\\" is a nice alternative track with lush instrumentation and layered vocals. It's one of the more abstract tracks on the album and seems just a little bit out of place.<br /><br />\\"Blow Away (For Bill)\\" is a dig at her previous albums with vivid imagery and literacy in her lyrics. The song has a very eclectic feel to it. It's a nice change of mood before the next track.<br /><br />The next song is \\"All We Ever Look For\\" and highlights a parent and child's relationship. The song is one of the best on the album and combines elements of simplicity (the melody) and an interwoven story/theme (the opening of the doors). The song has superb instrumentation, the choices of instruments really suit the song's theme and atmosphere.<br /><br />\\"Egypt\\" is a song about love with or in Egypt, the song can be percieved as both really. It's a very exotic song in a similar vein to \\"Kashka From Baghdad\\". Kate's voice is very sensual with hints of sultriness.<br /><br />The next two tracks are more rock influenced than anything else, firstly is \\"The Wedding List\\". It has funky feel to it with it's pulsating guitar rhythm and high pitched vocals. A really good song.<br /><br />\\"Violin\\" is an epic rock like track that is amazing. The violin sounds like something from the mountains of Austria but with an electrified punch. Kate's vocals soar in and amongst the instruments and mimic the violin. A great example of Kate's experimentation.<br /><br />\\"The Infant Kiss\\" is a random and weird track that flows well and leads onto the next track with ease.<br /><br />\\"Night Scented Stock\\" is a lovely instrumental track that follows on well from the previous song, \\"The Infant Kiss\\".<br /><br />\\"Army Dreamers\\" is a great track that leans towards the style of \\"The Dreaming\\" more than anything else, it's one of her best tracks with a nice toy-soldier march feel to it.<br /><br />\\"Breathing\\" is a fantastic song about a baby suffering in it's mother's womb because of nuclear radiation. The song is the best on the album and is very emotive. Overall an amzing track to close the album on.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a difficult one to classify as it combines various elements and shows influences of previous and forthcoming albums. The album has superb production and some amazing songs. This album is again another classic by Kate and was the first album by a British female to top the UK charts.>\\"Violin\\" is an epic rock like track that is amazing.

0345389409|1.0|Rice is brilliant -- but don't read this one. She's ripping off Goethe, Christopher Marlowe and the entire Faust legend. Just read those amazing tales instead -- and don't destory the image of Lestat you may have formed from other works. Sad to see him become so boring and inconsistent here.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|And yet enough horror movie joins the horror movie craze, this time very unsuccessfully.  Quentin Tarantino's 'Hostel' was billed as 'one of the scariest American movies in decades'.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The plot is woeful and centres around a group of macho American lads out to get their bit with beautiful women.  The movie begins in Amsterdam and not content with scoring with a hooker, they are advised to travel to Slovakia where women go mad for the American accent. <br />Unfortunatley for them, sex don't come that easy and they are tricked into entering a house where they are sold so the hostel can torture them any way they see fit. <br />Scares are non-existent in this film and Tarantino makes the repetitive mistake of associating explicit gore with shock value. <br />This movie is possibly one of the goriest I've seen and is not for the faint hearted.  Rent something intelligent instead. And if you've gone and seen it in the cinema like I have, don't you agree it wasn't worth going even for the popcorn?
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Felicity Huffman (Bree Osbourne) plays a man (Stanley), who long ago decided that wanted to be a woman. Her dream of some day getting the ultimate operation come closer as the movie develops, however, her dream crashes to pieces when she finds out that when she was \\"Stanley\\" he had a boy named Toby(Kevin Zegers). The movie shows the long journey of these two individuals that after meeting each other decide to go all the way to Los Angeles, so that Toby can fulfill his dream of being an actor and Bree can finally get her operation. Throughout most of the movie, Toby does not know that Bree is his real father so the connection between these two is mostly \\"friendly\\". Half way to Los Angeles Bree makes an attempt to take Toby back home, where he belongs, but after finding out that his step-father used to rape him, she decides to take him with her all the way to L.A. During their trip, Toby finds out the true Bree(that she used to be a man), and feels cheated because she lied to him. After embarrassing her a few times, Bree can not take it anymore and decides to get away from him, but the love that she has developed for him takes over and she decides to stay. They both develop a very strong bond towards each other, and more than a friendship comes in the way (as you will see in the movie). I won't ruin the rest of it, but this will give you more than enough reasons to get the movie, and check it out.  <br /> <br />I was very impressed with Felicity Huffman acting. She is great in every sense, and deserves every single award and nomination that she has gotten for this picture; and I have to say that she was my favorite for wining the \\"Best Actress\\" in the Academy Awards. This is an unforgettable movie, that won't disappoint you a bit. \\"5 Stars for Transamerica\\" <br />
B000C1ZXDG|1.0|Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story. <br />   Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary. <br />   This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea.
B000A35VTW|5.0|It is a very good subject brought about the liofe of a girl who begins her life with another motto and ends up being a prostitute but also is not regretful about her decision.  She accepts the life she is living and also how one day a painter maker her happy and make her feel good may be we can call it as  non expressive love.  This is a very good novel and I feel that every person with open mind and broad thinking would like this novel too.

He transforms from not caring about life to becoming a beacon for others.  It has come out that the book is not all based on fact.  A novel doesn't have to be 100% nonfiction to have an impact on people's lives.  I encourage those who have dealt with substance abuse to read this book. I would like to thank Mr. Frey for his story, the truth and the fiction, it has changed my life.
0446677450|5.0|Throughout the book, Robert is taught two completely different views on life from his two fathers.  His rich dad tells him to learn how to make money work for him, while his poor dad tells him to go to college and get a good job.  Overall, this is a great financial book for anyone who wants to learn about money.  It contains great advice that comes directly from a millionaire, and I suggest you listen closely.  Its only downfall is that it doesn't specifically tell how to become a millionaire.  I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking financial independence.
B000E8NQU4|5.0|Just because a disc is an SACD does not mean that it must be multi-channel.  SACD is a high resolution format that's CAPABLE of delivering up to 6 channels, but that doesn't mean all SACDs must be multi-channel discs. <br /> <br />The multi-channel mixes on the new Moody Blues SACDs are based on the quadrophonic masters prepared in the 1970s and released on four-channel reel-to-reel tapes.  To create 5.1 channels from the original 4 channel masters, a center channel was derived from the front right and left channels and the '.1' subwoofer channel was derived from all four channels by using some sort of low-pass filtering.   <br /> <br />In Search of the Lost Chord was never mixed in quad according to what I've read elsewhere, so this release is a hybrid SACD in stereo only.  It does not include a multi-channel version. <br />  <br />The first SACD discs ever released were high-resolution stereo only, and could not be played on regular CD players (e.g. Cyndi Lauper's \\"She's So Unusual\\").  Multi-channel SACDs were introduced later, and these discs often also include a high-resolution stereo version of the same program on the SACD layer.  Hybrid SACDs were introduced to provide backwards-compatibility with regular CD players.  These discs have a normal CD layer as well as a SACD layer, and that SACD layer can be stereo only (like the Rolling Stones remasters from 2002) or stereo and multichannel (like the Elton John SACDs that came out in 2003 and 2004).  There are even some classical SACDs that have stereo and 3 channel (left/center/right) versions of the same program (e.g. RCA Living Stereo and Mercury Living Presence discs that were originally recorded on three tracks back in the late 1950s and early 1960s).  Thus ends today's lesson on SACD formats...    :) <br />
B000BEZQ0Y|3.0|I love this version of the story. Its been filmed so many times but I think this must be the best. The lead characters are especially involving. The music is fine even though much of it was \\"borrowed\\" from classical music. There are some very <br />touching moments in this movie and the music adds to the atmosphere. Its just not the most original soundtracks I have heard. Despite that its worth hearing.

You have much more to say in there......As one of your fans, i am going to keep pulling those gifts out!
B000000OU4|5.0|This record may be an upset for purists. Well, this can be no jazz, can be no contemporary, can be what Metheny is not accustomed to do. But, who cares? The disc is fantastic, whetever the optics you have. Don't forget this has a Grammy award (something Pat has in more than a dozen).    I can say I have been late to Pat Metheny. I have listened to Yellowjackets and Weather Report with both joy and interest and I have made an idea of what fusion or contemporary jazz was. Some other groups are more predictable, like Fourplay and Rippingtons, but they still got the punch. They move into latin jazz, adult and even funky, so the \\"label\\" is not clear.    Describing this disc is not simple. The quality is exceptional, the rhythm is catchy and some songs deserve a lot of hearings to discover all that is behind. Some could say it has an abuse of programations and canned melodies but still you can hear the best Pat's guitar and Lyle's keyboards.    \\"Girls next door\\" has not only rhythm, melody and virtuosism. It has such a delicious bizarre mood that makes it an irresistible song.    \\"To the end of the world\\" is incredible and hypnotizing. You don't want the 12 minutes to reach to an end.    \\"Here to Stay\\", is a rich melody that introduces de disc. It is the sort of thing you are going to discover further.    The overall disc sounds really modern and accessible for new public. I repeat that this is not a good thing for purists. Remember that when you are trying to discover a new artist you need to understand his proposals and then you can go further.     Accesibility doesn't mean low quality. Metheny has got a lot of recordings, better or worse (well, it is difficult to find a bad recording from him). But if you want to know about him, I strongly recommend to start with this \\"We Live Here\\". You won't regret.    Afterwards, you will be loving it for a lifetime.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|before this album came out eric said he wanted to make a rock pop album. i thought he might have done something along the lines of his first solo album from 1970 that was one of his finest. this one is a pointless stinker, no inventive guitar playing or memorable songs. two stars because he is clapton but no more than that.
B00008PC2O|5.0|\\"Terminator II\\" is an excellent movie with a lot of action. The film was well made with excellent sound and picture quality. I loved the action, comedy and excellent acting by the main stars, Arnold, Sarah, John and Patrick.<br /><br />The storyline is that ten years ago, the machines that rule the future sent a Terminator to destroy the unborn John Connor. However, they had failed. Now a cyborg that can change its shape is sent back from the future to kill John Connor before he can grow up and lead the fight against the machines. This newer Terminator is more deadly. Its efforts are thwarted by a protector (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) whose duty is to save John and his mother Sarah.<br /><br />This movie is one of the best box offices smashes of all time and with good reason. The action is non-stop and the special effects are out of this world. The ending could have been different. The \\"Protector\\" should have lived rather than face the same fate as the Terminator.

1904920209|5.0|The DVD included with this book gives the most detailed visual instructions on creating bread dough that I have ever seen, much less read. I'm not an avid reader of bread-specific baking books, but the instructions included with the bread recipes in the more general baking books that I own devote about two sentences to how to actually mix the flour with the wet ingredients and develop the dough.  <br /> <br />This book presents an entire philosophy, and the results have been fantastic. Acceptance of the proper higher initial moisture level and the use of the stretching technique presented here have truly elevated our breads and our interest in breadmaking to a whole new level.

B0007O38XU|4.0|This is one heck of a sci-fi spoof of Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, and Planet of the Apes. It got me laughing so hard that I literally almost had a heart attack. Mel Brooks, John Candy, and the rest of the cast do well here. The jokes are spot-on and there is no feeling of being drowsy when watching this. Thank you, Mr. Brooks!<br /><br />A-
B000E1YVZU|2.0|I fully understand how difficult it must be to adapt a stage musical/rock opera to work as a movie. If you did not see the stageshow, don't bother watching this version as you will most probably hate it. But if you did see the show, you will in all probability be disappointed with the movie (but you won't necessarily hate it). It was decided that the characters would speak more dialogue than in the stage version.I would have gone for wall to wall music and truly kept it a rock OPERA, because it just doesnt work anymore for a character to speak and then suddenly start singing. Not in this setup where they tried to be as \\"real\\" as possible. Even though they are a bit too old for their parts, I accepted the original cast members and respect them for originating the amazingly successful Broadway show. I just felt NO emotion while watching the movie, I was detached and watching the timer on my DVDplayer to see how many minutes were left. Completely the opposite of my experience in the theatre (I saw it in 1998). I know some devoted fans LOVE the film and I am glad they do - as we need to see more musicals on film. But after this movie I am sure the studios will think thrice before attempting another stage to screen movie musical. RENT was a gamble that did not pay off. And I am very sorry about it, as I WANTED it to work.<br /><br />There is a very insightful documentary on disc 2 (about the tragic story of Jonathan Larson, the creator of RENT) as well as some deleted scenes and even an alternative ending. I would have gone for that alternative ending by the way - as one of the most memorable moments in the theatre was when Angel came back on stage at the end)
0679731725|5.0|Ishiguro masterfully uncovers the life of Stevens, a prudish butler, who is as strait-laced and bitchy as they come. Stevens lives comfortably sheltered from responsibility while his every decision is regulated by the rules of aristocratic England, until World War II shakes up the aristocracy, making his world obsolete. No longer able to let rules of propriety guide his every decision and relationship, he fondly recalls the golden days of his prime, when he passed over all chances for intimacy with a cold-hearted precision that is all the pride and glory left him in the remains of the day.<br /><br />Ishiguro's portrait of a cold-hearted man of duty is beautiful and touching, even when it ought to feel chilling. He offsets Stevens with the one possible romance of the butler's past, Miss Kensington, who opts in the end for a harshly imperfect love.
B0000787FH|4.0|As others have written here, this is the album that bridges Elvis v1.0 and Declan v1.0.  Whether it's the masterpiece where black and white turns to color (i.e. The Beatles' Revolver) is often debated.  For my money, this is the best that Elvis/Dec would do for at least the next 15 years - his subsequent work, IMHO, being dabblings in this genre or that.<br /><br />This would have been 5 stars, but my ears are STILL bleeding from the horrible, early digital on the original release mastered on the \\"CBS Discomputer.\\"  Rhino has done an admirable job of de-digitizing this album.
B000E6ESL2|2.0|Boring, Boring, Boring<br /><br />i don't know if its just me or the movie is really boring , so go ahead and rent it instead of buying it ,im a big fan of Ewen but this is one of his worst performing ?
B000EHRVP6|5.0|As far as I can tell, this is the exact same as the theatrical release. If you are looking to purchase this DVD simply for the \\"extra\\" content, don't bother. We searched and couldn't find it. The commentaries are nice, but true gore afficionados will probably want to wait and find out if an ultimate director's cut or some such is released before paying for the theatrical version. (Please, feel free to tell me if you know where the \\"sicker and more twisted\\" parts are. Really, if they're there, I'd love to know. e-mail Mandapandabeair@aol.com and put Hostel in the title so i don't delete you)
B00005NJJ9|4.0|Recently purchased the \\"Special Edition\\" version of this DVD. Thank goodness I recorded this on VHS from the TNT broadcast of this event in 2001, and still have the original VHS release of this in my collection.  <br />Why..? because two of Elvis' seminal live recordings are omitted from this so-called \\"Special Edition\\"; namely, \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\", and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" (both of which were on the original TNT presentation). From a performance aspect, I can understand the editing for \\"Bridge..\\", as the version in \\"ELvis On Tour\\" is one of his most powerhouse vocals, if not being the the all-time definitive live performance of this song; but to eliminate \\"Believin'\\" from this version of the movie, after putting the track on the menu portion of the DVD and including Elvis' own trepidation regarding the words is unforgivable. Once more, not only is the casual Elvis fan robbed of one of his finest performances, but the serious fan will never understand why they keep getting short shrift on what should be a reverent retrospective of an enormous talent. <br />Overall, a fantastic look back at a portion of Elvis' career that sometimes gets dismissed - he's at the top of his vocal ability, the band is tight, and it's a cryptic look at a top-flight stage show from inception to final curtain. <br />Now, Time/Warner and Ernst Jorgenson, how about the same treatment for \\"Elvis On Tour\\"...? It's long overdue.
B00003000M|5.0|Read this review in its entirety... (especially if u gave it less than 3 stars) I'm empathizing with those who are giving this album 1 star, but for the life of me I don't see why.... This album is in NO WAY insulting to Bob Marley. Was it insulting to Patti Labelle when P!nk, Lil Kim, Mya, and C. Aguilera remade and remixed Lady Marmelade? Uh, No. Is the Luther Vandross Tribute Album insulting? No. This is the cycle of our times people... That's what makes black people beautiful, our music, our culture.. how we can mix and match it and its still just as beautiful. There is nothing wrong with this cd and although of course I cannot speak for Bob Marley anymore than any of you can... To say he would not be happy is obsurd, how do we know what would make him happy?  We don't!  But to say the album is garbage to me is an insult to the artists who came together to blend with the Legend. I do not at all think it was a poor or sore attempt.. I think it was very creative. People do remixes all the time... so what, it's ok for 50 Cent but not Bob? lol... be serious, this is about the music. And aside from Defending Bob Til Death as some of you are admirably doing, these tracks do not degrade him or his music in any way... What this cd Does is ALLOW BOB MARLEY TO BE APPRECIATED THRU THE TIMES... and yes, you should appreciate the original tracks!! But lets be real, a lot of people can't get into some of the original tracks so what this CD does is Open up a door for appreciation across the genre boundaries.  It allows the \\"hip hop heads\\" so to speak who may sooner recognize the name \\"Lil Scrappy\\" before \\"The Wailers\\" to embrace the Marley ESSENCE... it's just like a baby, if u want your child to each vegetables, maybe u mix them with some rice... if you want them to intake more calcium.. maybe u let them drink Ovaltine.. are you degrading Calcium? lol.. anyway, moving along... This is an awesome cd that embraces BoB Marleys talent and mixes it with our evolving urban style...I think they did an excellent job on the cd. All too often \\"remix\\" and \\"master mixes\\" drown out the quality of the songs we come to love and respect an artist for but this project was the exact opposite! I love the original tracks, but I must admit I am loving Some twists on the tracks JUST as much!  Especially REBEL MUSIC and JOHNNY WAS... I don't want to go thru track titles cuz I'll end up naming them all... Each track and the guest artists get a thumbs up to me, at least for creativity... I see the vision of what this CD was and I like it.  Most definiately a must have for raggae/raggaeton music lovers, especially, but anyone who likes urban music should be able to appreciate this album... And while you are at it, check out Matisyahu! Excellent addition to a family of cultural music artists.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|First, forget about the sex! For those that actually watched the movie realized that one of the young men there had no intrest in either sex of drugs. It is not a soft porn movie . The movie is really about this: People pay large amounts of money so that they can have the pleasure of privately torturing,mulitating victims,absolutely anyway they want. The amount that one has to pay to victimize depends on the nationality of the victim (sucker) with American men being most in demand. Oli found these 2 American guys. He played the role of a \\"dummy\\" who does nothing but get stoned and dosen't care where he has sex. Oli's job was really to bring them to the hotel,which was a stopping point for death. During the visit, they are drugged and taken to the real hostel. At the real hostel,as you noticed,the guy was in one room and the lady was in the far room. Later it became clear that people(any sick individual with the money)were paying to do this to people. The sex was just a lure. The surgeon and the second assailant and the others were just people who paid the fee to do what they did. The fee had to be high because they were paid $25,000.00 just to bring the American. If you're the kind of person who falls for the sex, you would probably end up there!
B000EHRVP6|5.0|This movie is very worth seeing.  Don't expect to be jumping or screaming because that's not where the fear lies in this movie.  It is pure gore.  Doesn't every horror flick have alot of sex and violence??  <br /> <br />I guess the real fear in this movie is being trapped, helpless, waiting to get mutilated and die.
0142004413|5.0|I first read My Family...in the early seventies and reread it until it literally disintegrated.  I did the same with Gerald Durrell's other books.  It is sadly missing from my shelf of books that \\"I must read with the kids\\" and I am anxiosly awaiting its arrival.  The BBC did a lovely adaptation and I am saving it until after my kids and husband have read the book together.  The book will inspire you to take off for Greece, read Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, and let those bugs in the basement live a full and happy life.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|The only King Crimson album you need to own, I've not grown tired or less astonished by this album in 15 years.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have to admit that I had not heard anything else than one or two songs from Coldplay upon buying this album. With great expectation I put X&Y into my stereo. \\"Hmm, this is ok\\", I thought. One week later I was finding myself listening through the album time after time. The songs are just incredible. The album does not have weak spots. Especially \\"A message\\" and \\"Swallowed by the sea\\" are extradordinary beautiful. It takes some getting used to, but after that you are sold.
B000002KIT|5.0|I remember purchasing this album on 8-track tape and playing it non-stop in my '78 T-bird - my Craig Powerplay in overdrive and my 6 X 9's thumping away as best as they could. This \\"Lizzy\\" is by far the best live album ever (in my humble opinion). Being a bass player, I tried emulating Phil Lynott, from the way he wore his bass (sort of up high over his waist) to the way he used his pick. I wanted a black Fender Precision with the mirrored pick guard so bad!! In the halls of hard rock, there will never be another Thin Lizzy!! Godspeed, Phil!
B00005O3VD|5.0|I purchased this movie for my mom as a birthday present. She had mentioned the movie all throughout my life, yet I had never watched it. A few days after her birthday we decided to sit down and watch it and I was instantly hooked. The acting, the feel, the music! Everything about this movie was amazing. In fact, I enjoyed Streisand's character so much that I wound up naming my Shih Tzu puppy \\"Fanny Ziegfeld Brice.\\" :) <br /> <br />Be warned: after you watch this movie you will be itching to purchase the soundtrack, too!
B0006U3U6A|5.0|This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography.  It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University.  A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor.  To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.<br /><br />In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, \\"A Brilliant Madness\\" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices.  The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more \\"real\\" than the reality we normally experience.  So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside.  The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.<br /><br />Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience.  Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details.  I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach.  But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography.  I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.<br /><br />I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous).  Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy.  Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally.  If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections.  Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).<br /><br />The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed.  It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience.  While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances.  The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.<br /><br />Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it \\"pizza pie.\\"  There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market.  If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.<br /><br />New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another.<br /><br />Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship.  I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie.  Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.<br /><br />Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.eese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|The film was impeccable, and so was the soundtrack. When I saw the film, the amazing music score really got my attention. It was so remarkable & so moving that you couldn't even overlook, and it really captured the essence & emotion of the film flawlessly. If you liked the film, then I'm certain that you will also like the soundtrack because the music is one of the best things about the film. I've cried so many times after watching the beautiful Brokeback Mountain, and I couldn't help it but wept after listening to this inspiring soundtrack. It was so beautiful, heartbreaking and haunting that I was moved & touched so profoundly & deeply.    Gustavo Santaolalla's sparse, romantic score perfectly sets the tone for the film's panoramic countryside, while Willie Nelson's haunting, spoken narrative on \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" creates a mood as captivating as the one on Emmylou Harris' version of \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old.\\" Santaolalla's music for movies has involved a certain amount of experimentation, his work here is just subdued. The film had song usage in mind from the start, and Santaolalla also wrote multiple classically-inclined country ballads that have both been very well received by Country music collectors.     I would also recommend this soundtrack to all of you who haven't seen the film. I've shared this soundtrack with six of my friends (they haven't seen the film back then), and ALL OF THEM told me they got chills after listening to it. Now, five of them have bought both the DVD & soundtrack because they simply loved it.
1882723007|5.0|When I first read Embraced by the Light, I had taken it out of the library. I had not experienced having anyone close to me die, nor had I ever had such an experience as a near-death experience. What led me to the library was a broken heart, and the separation from a person I thought was my soul mate. Prior to that, I had been slowly rebuilding my life after being sick with a debilitating disease that forced me to put my life on hold. As a result I was looking for answers. That's when I found the comfort of Embraced by the Light.<br /><br />After asking the question, time and again, of why I'm here, what's the use, and is there anything better after this, Betty J. Eadie showed me a different prespective.<br /><br />I had started reading and studying about near-death expereinces, but Embraced by the Light was the most descriptive account I had ever read. I read that book three times before I had to return it to the library. After that, I couldn't be without it, and bought my own copy. Since then, I've read it three or four more times, and have also given a copy to a dear friend, who is sick like I was.<br /><br />Embraced by the Light is a vivid and descriptive account of dying, that is told in a gentle, yet simple way. Betty J. Eadie talks of her experience with such frankness and simplicity, yet with such awe and excitement, that one finds it hard to not open the heart and mind to her story and accept the message she tries to deliver in it.<br /><br />If you have lost someone close to you, or have dealt with the stumbling blocks of life so much so that you're asking the same questions I did, get this book. It may be the most comforting thing you can do for youself.
0786416211|5.0|Once upon a time, in an alternative magical version of London, there lived a young boy by the name of Nathaniel, who was apprenticed to a magician. In this London, magicians ruled the country as members of parliament, with their own invisible army that included imps, marids, afrits and djinns, waiting to be summoned into service.<br /><br />Young Nathaniel was a fairly diligent pupil, until one day when a haughty, braggart magician named Simon Lovelace humiliated him publicly and his weak master failed to defend him. Angered by this unfortunate experience, Nathaniel immersed himself into his studies, and just like the Sorcerer's Apprentice before him, soon began experimenting with magic far beyond his capacity to control.<br /><br />In a calculated act of revenge, he summoned a powerful and ancient djinni named Bartimaeus and commanded him to steal Lovelace's most cherished possession. Bartimaeus is the craftiest, funniest, and least modest fictional character in recent young adult fiction, and his part of the story is the most entertaining I've read for a long time.<br /><br />Of course when magic is involved, lots of things can go wrong, and they certainly did for Nathaniel, his master and Bartimaeus. Diabolical deeds, murderous plots, and magical mayhem are all on the menu in The Amulet of Samarkand, which I highly recommend to all young readers.<br /><br />Amanda Richards
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Now, I knew not what to expect when I purchased this film, but being a fan of horror, I decided to give it a go.  At first I was disappointed to find that it was written by the creator of \\"Cabin Fever\\"--a film that I wish I could erase from my movie-going memory.  But \\"Hostel\\" tries to break all the rules and it delivers in that regard.  I would only recommend it to DIE hard fans of the genre, especially if you have a penchant for gore.  This movie has wall to wall blood and guts.  It even evokes some Hitchcockian elements with Americans loosed in a Slovakian country where the characters surrounding them are not on the level.  At times, the film is so gratuitous with both sex and violence, that you almost roll your eyes at how unbelievable it is.  Yet, the reasons for why the gore occurs is a probable (and profitable) theme that could happen in reality.  That's what makes the movie all the more terrifying.
B0002IU988|5.0|First of I'll be honest I rate creed has one of my favourite rock bands ever but in all honesty this album is truly a work of art, its amazing from start to finish Myles Kennedy is a brilliant singer, the reason I was interested to hear alter bridge his because of Mark Tremonti, I always considered him has one of my favourite guitarists because of his melodies in his music which is what I loved about creed and its clear with alter bridge he has put it up a level. In rock these days you don't hear many guitar solos but with alter bridge its solo after solo and they are so fast the riffs are amazing just listen to the brilliant one day remains now that's what you call guitar riffs and solos I loved creed and I was sad they split up but at the end of the day if im being honest from the heart alter bridge are easily just has good and I recommend you see them live because they blew me away there so good live, plus I got to hang with the band after the London show last year there such cool people and down to earth, I hope people who don't want to let go of creed just give them a chance because they are probably one of the best rock bands on the planet today. Great album by brilliant musicians who are so gifted. <br /> <br />Find the real 5/5  <br />One day remains 5/5  <br />Open your eyes 5/5  <br />Burn it down 4/5 <br />Metallingus 5/5 <br />Broken wings 5/5 <br />In loving memory 5/5 <br />Down to my last 4/5 <br />Watch your words 5/5 <br />Shed my skin 5/5 <br />The end is here 5/5 <br />
B000E6UK5K|5.0|\\"Still, marooned<br />Silence drifting through<br />Nowhere to choose<br />Just blue...\\"<br />~The Blue<br /><br />Sweeps of sound lead you deeper into an oceanic escape of atmospheric pleasure. While blissful for Pink Floyd fans even the signature sounds are fresh and take off in new directions.<br /><br />Romantic notions of outdoor escapes and the mellow comforting moods make this an album well worth waiting for and it is David Gilmour's voice that makes you want to dive into this album time and time again. Images of diving into passionate experiences make this sexy in Take a Breath and yet it has a very spiritual dimension.<br /><br />While the lyrics are entertaining in content, it is how David Gilmour plays with the music and merges his voice into the notes with his signature pacing that captures my full attention. This Heaven is a vibrant selection with a spiritual sexy dimension:<br /><br />\\"I've felt the power in a holy place<br />Wished for comfort when in need<br />Now I'm here in a state of grace<br />This earthly heaven is enough for me\\"<br /><br />Images of the ocean and moon make this album especially romantic and calming. Red Sky at Night is instrumental and haunting with delicate waves in the distance and echoes of haunted ships and ghostly imaginings. Then I Close My Eyes is breathtaking and also has nature sounds at the start. At first it sounds like it has been recorded outside at a beach and then the music changes directions entirely as an atmospheric guitar bliss appears and completely hypnotizes the listener. A Pocketful of Stones has a soul purity enhanced by piano.<br /><br />Does it really matter what David Gilmour is singing? His voice is pure emotional bliss. Drown me in his voice anytime...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B00005JMXX|4.0|A light, enjoyable film.  People who review The Day After Tomorrow as if it were supposed to be a deep, complex masterpiece will be unhappy with this film. It's fun, the special effects are excellent, and why not think about climate change-- not only changes caused by our SUV's but also climate change that we cannot control. But you don't have to think deeply while watching this film; if you just want to relax and watch a film with great special effects and not-too-complex characters, this is a nice choice.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is the best film version of Hamlet out there.  It will not be the last, as Shakespeare's plays are so rich that they can be interpreted in many ways.  I was lucky enough to see this film in the theater in the original 70mm.  It was the last film shot in 70mm for a number of years (Terrence Malick's The New World was partly shot on 70mm in 2006).  The cinematography (by Alex Thomson) is truly breathtaking, and why this film wasn't nominated for photography is beyond me.  I love the fact that this film is the full text, to show the elements of comedy in the play (which weren't really present in other versions), and to really show how complex and deep this play/film really is.  Most of the acting is superlative.  Derek Jacobi and Julie Christie, 2 of the greatest actors/actresses the U.K. ever produced, giving exemplary performances.  Charlton Heston proves again that he is a superlative actor with his performance as The Player King.  Many American actors cannot do Shakespeare (as we see in this film with Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal. Crystal, especially, gives a painful performance.  He is certainly talented, but way out of his depth here).  Too often Heston is mocked for his \\"hammy\\" acting. I think he's a great actor.  Robin Williams as Ostric is actually good, because the character is a bit eccentric in the original play.  This was better than The English Patient, which won Best Picture in 1996.  I saw Patient right after this, and Hamlet made it look like a student film.  There are some flaws here (most notably Crystal and Lemmon, who don't really belong in this film), Branagh's performance is too over the top at times (really putting the ham in Hamlet), and perhaps a bit too many reaction shots.  But overall, an excellent work, and one of the best Shakespeare adaptations ever.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is my favorite c.d. & I have all of them except Try This. I love songs that you can dance to. These are my favorite songs Don't let me get me (I swear she is talking about me), Just like a pill(some relationships are like that), Get the party started (Like it), Respect (A very good song, Ladies you need to listen to this!), 18 Wheeler (a good fighter song), Misery (Duet with Steven Tyler oh yeah!), Numb (Angry song yeah I like it!!)  As you can probably tell I really like this c.d. To me this is the best of Pink!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|I don't want to malign the folks who wish that this were Star Wars, but geez, talk about wooden acting, boxy dialogue,  cornball plotting... I go off.  All apologies, Yodaheads! <br /> <br />Anyway, case closed.  This remains the greatest film of the talking period, period.  The technical stuff is great, but the core of the film, as one reviewer noted, is character.  Character is the genesis of great fiction.  I ought to know.  I've taught creative writing for twenty years and published a chunk myself, some of it pretty acceptable. <br /> <br />But there is more.  This film gets at, through Charles Foster Kane's excursions and incursions, the essence of American Imperialism, which appears more and more to be the essence of the American Character, the notion that \\"I'm right and everyone else is wrong, or at least inferior.\\"  Entitlement both personal and international.  Does this not ring anyone's bell?  Kane had his pet war, created by a corrupt government in collusion with the media...and we now get...?   Somebody shout it out:  Fox. <br /> <br />So if watching things blow up is your idea of entertainment, I'd recommend sticking with  games.  If you want to feel and think along with a movie that could have, should have, been made today, this is your ticket. <br /> <br />Also, you get Orson Welles acting with the bravura of a champ, not to mention Joseph Cotton, who is sublime as the innocent turned cynic.  And all the technical stuff that everybody talks about.   Yep.  Great.   Still, for me, this is one of the two movies that best encapsulate the \\"character\\" we 'murkins have backed ourselves into by neglecting to confront the dark side of ourselves and the society we've created.  The other, obviously, is that great film by David Lynch, Blue Velvet.   Quite a different film, but the two works have similar resonances. <br /> <br />Power, money, control, denial, rot, denial.   And then denial. <br /> <br />I also invariably find Citizen Kane quite entertaining.  I'vewatched it about fifty times, and laughed and cried.  I wince at the slow decay, the destruction of everything that touches the man.  Yet the early sequences with the young Kane!  They're hilarious, full of self-absorbed adolescence gone amok and gone on way too long, as one might also characterize some critics of this masterpiece...and who might see themselves a little too clearly, hence the negativity...and denial.   Nobody has approached the level of craft AND emotion of this movie and with Hollywood being what it is, nobody ever will.   Hello, Mr. Welles.  We forgive you forever for the wine commercials! <br /> <br />
B000EGCITG|4.0|I like this c.d. My favorite songs are Stupid Girls (Love it!!), A long way to happy, Mr. President ( Tell it girl!!), Cuz I can ( A fun song!!), I'm Lonely (everyone needs some space), U & U R Hand (Love it !!),& I got money now(good song). <br />I gave this a 4 because I don't really like the slow songs. I liked Misundaztood better.
B000FA57RQ|3.0|There's nothing better than seeing Madonna live in concert and then having the chance to see what exactly happened backstage during the tour. The scandulous love affairs, the dancers turning on one another, threats from the Canadian police, and, most of all, Madge's diva moments and tirades. Too bad none of this happens in \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret.\\" <br /> <br />But, to back up for a moment, I must confess; I love Madonna. Her music, her hammy acting, and, hell, I'd take the Kabbalah over Scientology anyday! In fact, I actually prefer \\"Ray of Light\\" and her other albums since, more so than her Blonde Ambition music. But, I must be completely honest, \\"Truth or Dare\\" is, by far, the better movie. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" is entertaining for die-hard Madonna fans, no doubt; it has some good, however limited, moments backstage, interesting but simple insights into her family life, and of course, great scenes from her \\"Re-Invention Tour\\" that will give your Dolby Digital receiver a run for its money. <br /> <br />I must applaud Madonna as a person, however. You can see the develpoment she has made in her personal life and her music from watching this film. No longer the four-letter-word spouting, boy-toy, Madonna appears to be a much better person to sit and have dinner with. She is nicer, more patient, more loving. <br /> <br />Who wants to see a movie about that?
B00004RHZU|4.0|Even though I liked Misunderstood better this is still a good c.d. Here are the songs I like: Hell Wit Ya (Every girl has probably been through this), There You Go (Love it!), You make Me Sick(Good), Let Me Let You Know (Slow but still good)(Very Singable), Private Show (good ), Can't take Me Home ( Love It!! Should have thought about that before you F@@@ed with me) I love this girl's Honesty. That is what I like about Pink. She tells it to you like it is. Do what U do is also a good song.(Freak anyone else, Do what you want) So I gave this a 4 because Misunderstood is better but this c.d. is still GOOD!!
0062502182|4.0|Coelho masterfully works an important but simple message into this exotic tale of a young shepherd boy from Andalusia in search of treasure.  Although the book's message is powerful when you read it the first time, I suspect this is a book that warrants multiple readings, and that one will likely get more and more from this book each time the book is re-read.  I think this is an especially helpful book for a person desiring spiritual refocusing and inspiration.
B000CCD0HQ|3.0|this record is far to be perfect, there is plenty of songs on it for which i don't care for; however i give 3 stars for the following reasons :   - Billy Gibbons is a good guitarist and i like his guitar tone and playing.  - the two first songs are excellent especially the enjoyable 'Jesus just left Chicago', a good song with excellent guitar playing.  - Shiek is a decent song but no more.   - the rest is in my opinion forgettable (included the bad live set).
1933456027|3.0|Leider ist das neueste Album nicht mehr von der gleichen Güte wie seine Vorgänger. Teilweise recht nette Ideen, an den Reichtum von Lateralus kommen Tool leider nicht mehr heran. Das Ganze ist zwar sehr sauber aber nicht wirklich \\"kicking\\" eingespielt.
B00005JO20|5.0|While the original movie of \\"King Kong\\" will always matter, I believe this is the version that all people who enjoy this story will turn to.  It is so much richer that the film has its own kind of majesty.  It isn't just a monster or a beauty-and-the-beast kind of tale.  This version is a metaphor for man's overestimation of himself and his abilities balanced with a story on the power of nature both as an external environment and as an inner drive.<br /><br />This vast movie has three large sections.  First, is the setup in New York in the 1930s.  Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is a down and out vaudeville performer with dreams of being in a stage production by her favorite writer, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Carl Denhem (Jack Black) is an almost-but-never-been movie director/producer is desperate to make a film and finally make it, but his backers want to sell off the reels he has as stock footage.  His female lead has backed out and he has to find a replacement.  Denhem and Darrow happen to meet and he talks her into doing the film.  Denhem has conned everyone, but everyone really knows they are being conned, but in the hearts want to participate anyway.  Even Driscoll manages to get caught up into Denhem monomania.<br /><br />The second portion takes place on Kong's home island.  It must be vast to support the huge life forms and the huge canyons and cliffs.  But reality isn't the point here.  The inhabitants of the island are truly savages and are decadent descendents or interlopers of the people who built the ancient wall and buildings.  The battles Kong has here to demonstrate his strength and supremacy go far beyond anything the first movie offered.  Of course, it is vital to notice the creatures in this natural jungle versus the mechanical creatures in the human jungle later in the film.  Be careful with young children, a couple of the battles with some of the fauna get to be pretty creepy.<br /><br />There are several key developments for the main characters here that matter later in the movie, but the key relationship is between Darrow and Kong.  She is a better survivor here in a particularly vicious nature than she was in the city, but Kong's protection gives her enough time to appreciate his majesty.  Driscoll and Darrow develop a mutual, but unstated affection and it is Driscoll who goes back to rescue her from Kong and the jungle.<br /><br />The third portion has Kong completely out of his environment and chained for the amusement of chuckleheads, well-dressed chuckleheads, mind you.  When Kong is presented with a fake Darrow, he decides he has to find the real one and breaks free, to Denhem's ruin.  He falls from the success for which he had always dreamed and schemed to the man who unleashed a monster on New York.  After Kong and Darrow find each other there are some touching scenes of mutual affection that culminate in the classic scene atop the Empire State Building - a stylized version of it.  The biplane battle echoing one of the encounters on the island leads finally to Kong falling from his final mountaintop.<br /><br />The movie is a visual feast and tells this story with sincerity and conviction.  It offers up the substance the story has rather than sensationalizing it and I think that is a real treat.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to you.acters here that matter later in the movie, but the key relationship is between Darrow and Kong.

B000002GIE|3.0|Throughout the latter half of the 80s, the Boston band Extreme became one of the city's most popular bands. Nuno Bettencourt, (guitar) Gary Cherone, (vocals) Paul Geary (drums) and Pat Badger (bass) packed clubs weekly and grew an enthusiastic following. The young and promising band was signed with A&M and anticipation ran high for the band's debut.<br /><br />Some bands blow their wad on the debut. It's not uncommon for a band to spend years playing clubs, build up a following, and then release the best of their material on the first album, and then enter the infamous \\"sophomore slump.\\" For Extreme, however, this was not the case. Of the band's four studio albums, the self-titled debut (1989) is by far their weakest offering.<br /><br />\\"Extreme\\" isn't a bad album, it's actually a decent effort. It's basically a by-the-numbers, generic hair-metal album. Like most pop-metal albums of the 1980s, it's a mix of Van Halen and KISS. It has all the ingredients essential to a hair metal album; sing-along choruses, a guitar virtuoso, catchy riffs, aqua net, party anthems, baled(s) and cheesy lyrics.<br /><br />The problem with Extreme's debut is that we've seen this all before, and done better, with such genre defining albums as Warrant's \\"Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich,\\" (1989) Motley Crue's \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" (1989) Poison's \\"Open Up and Say Ahh...,\\" (1988) and KISS's \\"Animalize\\" (1984). \\"Extreme\\" just comes across as another tired, formulaic album in a genre that was running out of steam. Still, the album is effective and fans of the pop-metal genre will find much to like with such songs as \\"Little Girls,\\" \\"Wind me up,\\" \\"Mutha, don't wanna go to school today,\\" and \\"Play with me.\\" The rest of the album is pretty much just filler, albeit enjoyable.<br /><br />Extreme was actually a highly underrated band that encompassed elements of Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Van Halen. The band would go on to make some incredible albums with their classic sophomore release \\"Pornograffiti\\" (1990) and their breathtaking magnum opus \\"III Sides to Every Story\\" (1992). Extreme's debut, however, is not up-to-par with those albums and is just another good, but untimely forgettable pop-metal album.ir classic sophomore release \\"Pornograffiti\\" (1990) and their breathtaking magnum opus \\"III Sides to Every Story\\" (1992).

B0002VK66U|2.0|I recently bought \\"Rescue You\\" and was extremely disappointed with it, so when I read all the rave reviews here on Amazon I was compelled to write a review of my own.<br />-<br />First off let me say that I'm only 26 and was not a fan of JLT in the '80s, I only started listening to him in the mid-1990s when I discovered Rainbow.  Once I got into Rainbow I went out and bought everything else I could find that JLT sang on.  I love Odyssey, Slaves & Masters, HTP, and most of Joe's recent solo albums.  I thought Holy Man was particularly strong, and really enjoyed JLT and The Usual Suspects as well.  Based on all this, I decided I had to have Rescue You.  Of course it was out of print until only recently, so I waited a long time before getting to hear Rescue You.<br />-<br />Once I found out that Wounded Bird had reissued Rescue You I ordered my copy right away.  I was really looking forward to hearing this album.  Chronologically this album is sandwiched right between BENT OUT OF SHAPE and ODYSSEY, two albums that I really enjoy, so I was expecting RESCUE YOU to be a good album, if not great.  I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when I finally heard this album.  It's not terrible, but let me tell you that RESCUE YOU does not hold a candle to any other album that Joe has done as a solo artist or as a full fledged band member(the only exceptions being Fandango, which I have not heard, and the many one-off and guest appearances Joe has done, ie. Brazen Abbot, etc, which I have also not heard for the most part).  Here is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked about this album; you'll notice that the bad far outweighs the good!<br />-<br />The Prosecution:  When you play this album, right off the bat you will notice how terrible and dated the production is.  The drum sound is attrocious, with that horrible '80s big snare-drum sound.  The rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix, to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the guitarist might be playing.  Worst of all are the cheesy '80s sythesizers which are positively dripping off of this album.  I thought I was trapped in an episode of Miami Vice!  Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike '80s rock or synths when they're used tastefully, like Don Airey or David Rosenthal's work in Rainbow, but the synths on RESCUE YOU are completely out of control.  We're not just talking about holding down chords here either; almost every song features synth \\"stabs\\" that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted.  The songwriting is not terrible, but is definitely sub-par.  \\"Losing You\\", \\"Rescue You\\" and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they'd been produced properly, but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album.  \\"The Race Is On\\" is decent as well, but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast Rainbow number; I'd rather go listen to \\"Spotlight Kid\\" again, thanks.  Finally, the lyrics on this album are pretty bad, even for JLT who has not always been the most creative lyricist; just because \\"rough\\" and \\"tough\\" rhyme with eachother doesn't mean they should ever actually be used in a song!<br />-<br />The Defense:  The only real saving grace of this album is that Joe's voice sounds great.  Somehow Joe's voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments(well maybe not the synths) and show of his great tone and delivery.  Don't get me wrong, Joe's voice is not enough to save an album this bad, but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why I bought RESCUE YOU in the first place, and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it!<br />-<br />The Verdict: Given the many strong albums Joe has sung on, and the handful of downright classics, RESCUE YOU is shockingly bad in comparison.  If you are a casual fan, don't waste your money.  If you are a completist like me, you are going tobuy this album no matter what I say, so just don't get your hopes up.  To anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it, don't give up on JLT, because pretty much everything else he's ever done is better than RESCUE YOU.  Go out and buy THE USUAL SUSPECTS and rock out to \\"The Power of Love\\".  If your collection is missing RESCUE YOU, you're not missing much!<br />-<br />Finally, look closely at the reviews below.  One of the reviews states (paraphrased): \\"if you are a fan of Bon Jovi, Foreigner, etc, you will like RESCUE YOU.\\"  Well, I don't know anybody who got into JLT because they like Bon Jovi.  Everyone I know who has ever even heard of JLT is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metal background.  I'd imagine most people who like JLT were first into Deep Purple, then Rainbow, and then JLT.  I don't think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this CD, not because it's not \\"heavy enough\\", but because it's not original enough, not timeless enough, and just plain not good enough.  If you enjoyed DIFFICULT TO CURE, ODYSSEY, or SLAVES & MASTERS, you would probably enjoy a lot of JLT's more recent work; however you will probably find RESCUE YOU utterly cheesy and unlistenable.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I really liked the premise of this movie and understand why it spawned a sequel, but what about that terrible acting!?!  Everyone in the movie seemed to be 'phoning in' their performance.  This movie was fairly original and disturbing, but just think how good it could have been.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Yhis movie has almost every thing you could ever want movie!!!   O.k., it's still has the same background as the original Peter Pan, only with a few surprises here an there! The two really good parts are when Wendy and Peter are dancing in the light of a full moon with faeries flying all around them; the other good part is when tinkerbell dies, and then every body in the world starts chanting that they do believe in faeries, and the chanting brings her back to life. I would like to tell you more, but I don't want to spoil the other surprises!!!
0380820846|2.0|Her mistake here was making Penelope Lady Whistledown. It overwhelmed the book and took away from the romance. The byplay between both characters on a personal level was lacking as Lady Whisteldown overwhelmed most of their conversations. Still think she is a great writer but this one should have been edited a little bit more.
B0000019PA|5.0|Wow, what a CD!  And how do you explain over 370 reviews for a CD that no one has ever heard of?  I only came across NMH because I was looking for another CD, and then I read about this other CD, which recommend NMH....etc..... <br /> <br />I think everyone else has said it in previous reviews, but I just want to add that Holland, 1945 is one song which I just can't get out of my mind...and that's a good thing! <br /> <br />Anyone interested in alternative, eclectic, original music really need to check this one out!
0880794968|5.0|This deck is exquisite. Hanson-Roberts' recoloring preserves the integrity of Coleman-Smith's original art. By simply using a new medium in which to color the templates, much depth and detail has been added to the imagery. \\"The Fool\\" card alone evokes certain feelings and associations for me like never before with a simple glance. The original Rider-Waite is a classic, perfection all by itself...but this \\"re-imagining through re-coloring\\" is an improvement, believe it or not.
B000063DFN|5.0|Ladies and gentelman, this is perfect metal album from 1980s.  <br />Iron Maiden mastered their melodic epic metal music with catchy melodies and brilliant musicanship.  <br />If you are a metalhead you should get this BRILLIANT piece of work... <br />yes!
B000063DFS|5.0|I'll never fully comprehend why it is that artists put out their best material - whether writing, music, films, art, poetry - during the most depressing times in their lives.  (\\"No More Tears\\" was made when Ozzy was beset by legal and personal problems.)<br /><br />It was interesting reading the note on the back of the remastered version (with the two extra tracks, \\"Don't Blame Me\\" and \\"Party With the Animals\\") that Ozzy \\"...plays this album all the time and I still think it sounds really good.\\"  I can't help but agree.<br /><br />I popped this in the CD player and didn't realize the time until I looked at the playlist and saw it was nearing the end.  I found myself singing aloud and just enjoying the rich sounds that came out of the CD.  (I was also surprised to see that I remembered the words after all these years!)<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"No More Tears\\" when it was first released in 1991 as a teenager and I enjoy it just as much today as a 30 year-old.  Two particular tracks that haven't gotten as much attention as others that I really enjoy are \\"Hellraiser\\" and \\"A.V.H.\\" Check them out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I tend to agree with a previous reviewer in that this was Ozzy's last really good album.  This is chock full of strong, original material.  His later works weren't up to par with \\"No More Tears\\" and \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" and, in recent years, he's been living off the residual effect of his MTV reality series \\"The Osbournes.\\"  Through that, he became part of the Establishment with the same people who crucified and vilified him in the past now kissing his derriere (I'm so \\"old\\" I remember when I was labeled a \\"devil worshipper\\" in grade school for liking him.  I'd bet those same people have jumped on his bandwagon today).<br /><br />In any case, I'll always love Ozzy and cherish his contributions to music (and his love of my beloved Beatles).<br /><br />Rock and roll forever!  - Donna Di Giacomo
B00004Z459|1.0|I am not reviewing Linkin Park, as a metal band. They  arent.  <br />But Linkin Park plays stuped repetive music.  <br />Basic stuped primitive riffs,  simple electronica effects, whiny voice with pseudo screams and rapper who just talks garbage.   Whoppee  do.. They have those fancy music videos, while their \\"music\\" is just  corporate stuff, dedicated for average lazy teenagers to move \\"their  ass\\"  and  \\"have some chicks and party\\"  with this so called rock music.  <br />PLease don't through Linkin park in rock/metal charts.  <br />They are equavalent to Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and other garbage artists.   <br />I used \\"Hybrid Theory\\"  as  a frizbee.  <br />Ladies and gentelman, there are 100s of more interesting bands out there.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|Not many people seem to have liked \\"Munich\\", and the reasons are many, the most prominent of which is that doesn't satisfy either of the \\"interest groups\\" with which the film deals. It is too soft (which probably means that Hollywood narrative conventions and the film's considerable budget count against its ability to untangle or \\"give voice\\" to some very iffy ethical issues).  <br /> <br />On that note, everyone by now seems to realise that it's narrative structure is deeply flawed: how does Avner have flashbacks of what happened at Munich? They cannot possibly be his memories as he wasn't there... A cheap trick to gain an emotional response that unwittingly leaves audiences cold.  <br /> <br />And Daniel Craig as a South-African (a blonde haired, blue eyed Afrikaner!) is wholly unbelievable.  <br /> <br />Anyway: flawed, but good enough.
0131479415|4.0|Many, many books have been written about Agile Software Development - and I love most of them. But also I'm beginning to think, that they are repeating themselves more and more. They are all praising Agile thinking, norms and principles. That's fine - but it isn't very instructive. It doesn't take the reader by the hand and say \\"come here, this way... Let me show you how to ...\\". <br /> <br />But now - finally with Mike Cohns \\"Agile Estimating and Planning\\" - we have a book that both digs down in a specific discipline and on the same time takes the reader by his hand and help him find his way through the maze of estimating and planning in a highly dynamic environment. <br /> <br />Before I read Mikes book, I didn't realize excatly what it was, that I was doing with estimating and planning in my own Agile projects. I just did it... Now I understand how much there is to learn, when you are new to the planning-challenge in dynamic and Agile projects. <br /> <br />A detail I like particuarly is, that Mike describes both Ideal-Days and estimation-points as two different ways of estimating. I agree with the book, that Ideal-Days is too difficult to use. The idea is, that an \\"ideal day\\" is a day, where you can work all day without being disturbed. Everyone knows, that these days does not exist - but we estimate as if they did. Afterwords we add some factor to compensate for disturbance. My personal challenge with this technique is, that people tend to forget the difference between ideal days and reguler days, which of course leeds to too optimistic plans. Mike advocates for estimation points, which have worked well for mee. Reason is - i guess - that estimation points are never mixed up with working days, which makes planning much easier and more reliable... <br /> <br />If you need some great advice on estimating an planning in Agile (and other?) projects - get Mikes book! <br /> <br />Ole Jepsen <br />Founder of the Danish Agile User Group
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This film has been hailed as the scariest film since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I don't think so, the hype is not well-deserved.  Although the haters will probably pounce on my review and say it wasn't \\"helpful\\", not much I can do about it. <br /> <br />The acting itself was fine, as was the idea.  Too bad the execution and character development were not.  The first half of the film?  Sex and drugs.  Our three adventerous lads find themselves in Amsterdam looking to party.  So the intro to the characters?  Looking to get stoned and laid.  Wow.  I really didn't like any of these boys.  And therein lies one of the problems.  In a good horror film, you should be rooting for at least *one* person.  I didn't.   <br /> <br />We've got the nerdy American bookworm who is trying forget his ex-girlfriend.  We've got the wanna-be law student who on one hand is a health-conscious vegetarian, while on the other hand he's looking for casual sex and drugs.  Worse?  For someone who is supposed to be an adult, he has a thirteen-year-old's reaction to naked women.  Then you have the token foreigner leading the dumb Americans around to find the best places for sex and drugs.   <br /> <br />That's how they meet Alex, who tells them about a hostel in Eastern Europe where they can find women who will do anything.  Of course, instead of staying on their planned trip to Barcelona, they immediately hop the first train they can, head off to Eastern Europe to go stay in a hostel which is apparently not in any guidebook.   <br /> <br />Arriving at the hostel, they leave their passports at the front desk (huh?!?) and get checked into a room, which is conveniently enough co-ed.  Our dumb heros, who think only with their little heads, eagerly follow the ladies they now room with around like sad little puppies, and each one gets picked off one by one.  Turns out the women aren't impressed with anything about our boys except that two of them are American. <br /> <br />The token foreigner disappears, and our American boys run around a foreign city looking for him, encountering criminally insane children.  I guess this was supposed to either be scary or remind us about the plight of the poor Eastern Europeans.  It didn't work, it just came across as goofy. <br /> <br />Anyway, the bookworm gets himself kidnapped while his buddy is passed out in a backroom of a bar, wakes up in a dungeon, and gets himself tortured and killed.  It didn't last long.  Then our next American hunts around the strange city, and eventually discovers all is not what it seems.  Not really much of a plot twist, if you ask me.  He gets tortured by a bungling German, and things quickly go downhill from here.  His escape was utterly laugable, and utterly unbelievable.  He has two hands hacked in half, and runs around acting like nothing is wrong.  In an attempt at redemption, he saves a young Japanese woman who has had half her face burned off.  They escape the dungeon, and thus starts our merry chase through Europe.  Mind you, it seems physically impossible that these two are even capable of moving with the extent of their injuries, but I guess that would have just gotten in the way of the rather bad plot.  The ending was terrible.  Revenge?  In his condition?  Sure.  Right. Another sad shot at redemption. <br /> <br />The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is mainly because of the acting.  All the characters were believable, even if unlikable and dumb as bricks.  It helped the movie move along, taking a very bizarre and unusual hunting game, and making it somewhat believable.  Additionally, I'll give the folks behind-the-scenes credit.  They didn't overdo the gore.  Personally, I didn't find the film all that gory.  They could have gone over-the-top with the gore, and from what I had heard about this film, that's exactly what I was expecting (\\"People passed out watching it!\\", \\"I couldn't watch it in one sitting, it took me three tries to watch the whole thing, I was so scared!\\").  It was selectively used, and used in the right places to both frightening and comical effect.  I don't see the \\"unrated edition!\\" hype.  It seemed to me to be an average \\"R\\" film.  Finally, it was an interesting premise.  Foreigners paying the locals to find them people to kill.  A hunt where the hunter has his subjects captured for him, and then gets to torture his victim in any way he can think of.  It really was an intersting premise, even if it was poorly executed (excuse the pun).   <br /> <br />I actually preferred \\"Wolf Creek\\" to this.  Same level of gore, and although it was a standard horror film premise (kids on vacation get stranded and saved by the man who eventually tries to kill them), it was put together better.  The characters were likable, I found myself rooting for them, and much like this film there was (a) an extensive lead-in before the horror kicked in, giving us the opportunity to get to know the characters, and (b) use of physical gore to surprise us, rather than the use of gore for gore's sake. <br /> <br />Overall, I have to say I was disappointed with this film.  It was average at best, and it was a victim of its own hype.  Had it been a small film released straight to DVD, I may have enjoyed it more.  However, it just didn't deliver the goods.  So, three stars.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I, as all the others, heard this band with the tremulant and became absolutely obsessed.  ATDI was a good band, but immature in their use of their talent, punk was definately just a stepping stone.  Then came the explosion, De-loused, setting the world of rock on it's side.  I listened to the album for hours, finding every intricacy that was laid out in it's beauty, but alas, how would the follow up compare?   <br /> <br />It's 100x better. <br /> <br />I'm sorry, because that sounds like an exageration, but you must understand my musical stylings.  I'm a jazz man (who was introduced to rock by his parents, 2 guitar loving rock fans and have always had a soft spot for good rock (read: radiohead, sonic youth, Tool, Primus etc.).   <br /> <br />When I heard Frances for the first time, I litterally cried.  Upon listening to Miranda, I realized my dream had come true.  To all those catagorizing them as prog, take a listen to Mahavishnu Orchestra (hell, any John McGlauhin album)... to Miles Davis' 70's stuff, to weather report etc.  This band finally resurrected the one genre worthy of a superband. <br /> <br />And to those who think it's a pretentious album filled with ambient trash, go see these guys live.  I was kind of turned off by the noise too, but it was just a misunderstanding.  It isn't pretentious at all, on stage these guys build up with the ambient, after a song is complete, they don't stop playing, they slow, or individuals stop... but the keyboardist and the bassist will play a slow melodic whispy dream... until Cedric and Omar almost litterally explode into the next song that will abosolutely blow your mind. <br /> <br />Thinks I love about Mars Volta: <br />-Omars timing and tone:  He can choose the notes to play, but his timing is on par with the greats, listen to him burn away on Pisacis and L'via... the man doesn't miss a beat. <br />-Jon Theodore:  Everything about this guy screams he could be the best drummer of our generation.  I do liken him to Billy Cobham (he doesn't have the strength nor the speed of Billy), his technical precision and ability to flip on a dime are second only to Joe Russo (of *new* drummers) of the Benevento Russo Duo. <br />-The Fact that they are relentless: Frances never lets up, only for The Widow, which laughably HAD to be the single as no other song could possibly be played on the radio.  From the opening of Cygnus to it's return on Sarcophagi this band lays it down... a 100% effort. <br /> <br />I don't mean to rant, but this band could rule the world and deservedly so.  Due to the soon to be breakup of Radiohead (after 1 last album and tour, yay!) the rock world will be left without a king, and I truly, hopefully put all of my chips on The Mars Volta, they give me goosebumps.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I was truly touched by this movie, even though at some parts I wanted to fast forward because the plot slowed down. The cinematography was superb, Ang Lee did us Wyomingites proud (even though this is filmed in Canada). In Wyoming, this is a real issue that no one wishes to consider. Gay beatings do happen here (Matthew Shepard)and there are many homophobes here. Homosexuality is a taboo and Ennis had realistic thoughts about Jack and himself living together. You must be open minded while watching the film because it does get intense in some areas, but definately a film that needs to be watched at least once.
B000001FKY|4.0|You know, looking at the reviews on Pyromania, most everyone writes about how it's a great pop metal album, pop rock this and that.  In comparison to this album, Pyromania is hard rock and roll, and Hysteria is a radio friendly, songs easily accessible for singles, lite metal, pop rock.  Yeah, there are some great songs on here...but it just seems this band went balless after this release.  I mean Women, Love and Affection, Love bites, come on...is this a Def Leppard album or Bon Jovi?!?  Oh well, Rocket, Animal, Pour Some Sugar on Me, Armageddon It, Hysteria are all great tracks in between stuff that unfortunately would turn the band into pusses in about 4 years

B000EGCITG|4.0|In this splendid CD, Pink shows that she is capable to sing Jazz, Rock, Folk, and Pop music. With a couple mis-haps and many right turns. She makes a very enjoyable CD. <br /> <br />1. Stupid Girls-3/5-It's a very good message she is sending. Yet some of the lyrics don't make an extreme amount of sense. \\"Pretty will you f**k me girl, Silly I'm so lucky girl, Pull my hair I'll suck it girl, Stupid girl\\". Making that part of the song a little odd & hard to understand. The music and vocals are above-average. This was a very smart choice for her first single. Considering she neede to reinvent herself after the lack-laster promotion & sales of TRY THIS. <br /> <br />2. Who Knew-4/5-In this song of heartbreak she shows off some amazing vocals with some lesser amazing lyrics. Pink shines greatly on the 1st verse and chorus. This song could of been a 5 star if she would of kept the enjoyable factor in the rest of the song. <br /> <br />3. Long Way To Happy-5/5-This is absolutely a highlight of this album. Not much else to say about a song of this fine quality without going over-board with compliments. <br /> <br />4. Nobody Knows-3/5-In this song Pink talks about how nobody knows about her or her future but her. \\"And I think nobody knows, Nobody knows, Nobody knows but me, Me.\\" This is not filler, but it's music & lyrics are barely above-average. <br /> <br />5. Dear, Mr. President-5/5-This song is on a very touchy subject. Pink talks about how she thinks George Bush finds he is above the people in America. She writes this song with heart & soul, not pure hatred. Which makes it a more listenable song. Her vocals shine and the lyrics soar.This is another album highlight. <br /> <br />6. I'm Not Dead-2/5-Even on great CDs there is filler and this song is filler. The vocals, music, and lyrics are below-average. <br /> <br />7. Cuz I Can-4/5-This is a example that Pink may not be at her best in rock songs, but she can still shine. Her vocals are not the greatest, yet the lyrics& music are stellar. She seems to have a lot of fun on this song. Probably because this is a fun song. <br /> <br />8. Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)-3/5-Not exactaly a filler track, but not a album highlight. Her vocals and lyrics are extrodinary yet the music just doesn't work. Maybe if she had used a different producer this song would be a stand-out. <br /> <br />9. U & U're Hand-3/5-This song is a very club/rock song with music and lyrics that don't work for Pink(See #8). Because of this her vocals are weak. Still this is a great dance tune. <br /> <br />10. Runaway-4/5-Pink takes her vocals & writing skills to the next level, so she can write and sing a song that suits her very well. She talks about how she wanted to make her parents proud of her but, when all she gets is disappiontment, she runs away. the music is very suitable for Pink. This is a true Pink song. <br /> <br />11. The One That Got Away-3/5-This is a bluesy/folk song. Pinks vocals and lyrics are maybe the best on the whole album. Yet her music (To me) again just doesn't suit her the way it could. <br /> <br />12. I Got Money Now-4/5-Pink talks about how she thinks she doesn't need people to like her now that she has money. \\"You don't have to like me anymore, I got money now, I don't care what you say about me, I got money now.\\" Good Vocals, Good Music, And Good Lyrics. <br /> <br />13. Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self-5/5-This song is another album highlight. (See #3) <br /> <br />14. I Have Seen The Rain-2/5-Sweet that she did this song with her father. But below-average vocals, music, or lyrics. <br /> <br />In conclusion the 1st half of the album went smoothly but, gets a little rockey at the end.
0312995423|4.0|This book is very good. It put the reader in the cryptography world where exists a lot of technologies. The author added in the history, several cryptography technologies that are used to protect confidential informations. In parallel to this, occurs a tram of love and power.
B00004YM0D|2.0|Somebody from Florida asked about the missing song.  It's \\"Them Changes\\" by Buddy Miles, one of the all-time great funk-rock artists of the 60's.  He played with Hendrix, Pickett, Ruby and the Romantics, etc.  \\"Them Changes\\" is the best song in the movie, and it's missing from this soundtrack!  How could they exclude it?!!!  Without \\"Them Changes,\\" this soundtrack is a 2 (same tired old songs we've heard a 1000 times).  With \\"Them Changes,\\" this soundtrack would have been a 5.  Here's my advice:  forget this soundtrack and order the CD \\"Them Changes\\" by Buddy Miles.
B000069HKH|2.0|Sadly, as a once loyal suppoter of the boss, I acknowledge that he  simply doesn't have it anymore. The E street band has also grown either old or tired or both. I use to see BS at many of the small venues in New Jersey in his heyday. Great shows to be sure. In 2005, the last two shows at Shea stadium were a  total disappointment. After starting two hours late, he gave the most lackluster performance to date. Clarence stood there like a rock and barely played. The rest of the band sounded week and loose. Almost as if they really didn't care. The boss was moving around a lot but vocally off key and strained to hit any of the tough notes. What a disappointment. If you're a BS fan, I know you hear it. If your not a fan, don't bother. His day is done. Buy the old records and rejoice in what was once a truly unique talent.
B00005JMX6|5.0|People have compared it to Risky Business.  The major difference is that this movie has a much better plot and the ending is superb.  I highly recommend \\"The Girl Next Door\\". <br /> <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I first saw this playing at Best Buy and just had to have a copy. I grew up in the 60's listening to Cream and have studied and have been influenced by Clapton more than any other guitarist.<br /><br />Clapton, Bruce and Baker have even got better with age. Listening to them with more modern recording techniques just points to how much talent they have. Bruce still has the haunting high range voice, and Clapton complements it with his blues/rock pipes. Baker plays the drums with great intensity.<br /><br />The selection of songs is a very good sampling of their repetoire.<br /><br />I recommend this to any student of the great rock of the 60's!
0307276902|4.0|If this were a real story, WOW, but alas it is nothing but a good read.  Lots of people do these kind of things - lie.  What is the big deal, the book was moving and made you feel so what it was all a lie.  Aren't most of the love stories you read about or watch on T. V.  It is all just entertainment. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If I pre-order this here, will this movie be in English?  No Subtitles? Please tell me.
B000BCKFWK|2.0|I'm a comic geek, pretty much as ravenous for comics as they come, so I REALLY wanted to like this movie; furthermore, I liked Frank Miller's comic work on which this film is adapted.  But with much disappointment, I cannot give this film a good rating.  In fact, the only reason I do give it two stars is that I'll give them credit for trying new things, like trying to transfer the \\"look\\" of the comic onto the screen - and maybe for Bruce Willis' role, as well.  But the sum of the parts is that this is a disappointing film.   <br />    The movie's biggest flaw is that it tries much too hard to be \\"noir,\\" as if a room full of Hollywood executives were sitting around saying \\"let's make this noir.\\"  It simply doesn't work that way.  I don't how to articulate exactly the kind of artificiality that the film exhudes, but I would use a film like Kill Bill as a contrast: in that film, Tarantino is able to make a kung-fu movie; he didn't make a movie that \\"tried\\" to be a kung-fu movie.  Apply that to this film, except the other way around.  It tries way too hard to be something, so much that it is distractingly apparent.  The film seems to be saying \\"look at these stylized, hyper-visuals; look at this black and white; look at this ultra-violence,\\" without once really asking us to look at the movie itself.  I honestly wish I could have given this movie a better review, but I just can't.  If you did like it, you will love the comic, which is much better (though I still wouldn't put it at the top of my most recommended comics list)., wenn man es liest und es will sich auch nicht in den Kontext einfügen. Andererseits sind die abschließenden Handlungen nicht stimmig, ich will hier nicht näher ins Detail gehen, um nicht zu viel zu verraten. Insgesamt ist es aber dennoch ein wirklich gutes Werk, das vor allem die ganze Zeit über die Spannung halten kann. Selten noch habe ich noch ein Buch so schwer aus der Hand gelegt wie dieses.
B00005JLKN|1.0|This movie, based on the Thomas Harris book, is a remake of the movie 'Manhunter.' The story leads up to the events of the popular Silence of the Lambs film. Red Dragon was remade because the studio wanted to cash in on the surprising popularity of Hanibal Lecter. Unfortunately the supply of Thomas Harris books was exhausted. So they revisited and retitled this prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. In Thomas Harris's book and the original Manhunter Dr. Lecter was an intriguing support character only. But now Hollywood has discovered that Hannibal's character brings in moviergoers so they take every opportunity in Red Dragon to add or lenghten scenes with Dr. Lecter and put him center stage.     The original Manhunter was a fine film directed by Michael Mann. It featured Brian Cox (Bourne Identity) as Dr. Lecter and William Peterson (CSI) as Special Agent Graham. This movie is lacking in all aspects to the original (and to the book). While Anthony Hopkins's portrayal is as good as Mr. Cox's Edward Norton is clearly out of his depth. He is unable to convey the complex emotional trauma that Agent Graham experiences when he assimilates the mindset of a sadistic killer who wipes out entire families. Performances by Harvey Keitel and Ralph Fiennes are also wasted here. My advice-buy or rent the original.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This album brings back so many good memories and fun times?  Can somebody 29 say that? LOL, I like every song on this collection which is surprisingly inexpensive.  Anita Baker's GH was like 17.00, but still worth every penny.  And so is Phil Collins, I don't know if I a am more of a Phil fan, or a George Michael fan? I guess Phil since he has more material.  His Blue-eyed soul as it was called in my generation is wonderful Music.  Music being the key word there, there's music all around that just feels good.  Unlike the sexually-driven music of today.  I like Musicians who tell you stories or feelings in their songs.  Philly Phil always has something to say, insightful, loving, angry, or hurtful.  Phil and Michael McDonald are so under-appreciated in this world of music IMO.  This CD is off the chain!  If you like fun-time music w/ great acoustics buy this.  Another suggestion: George Michael\\"Ladies & Gentelmen: George Michael\\", Anita Baker's Greatest Hits; Chaka Khan \\"Epiphany\\" collection; Luther Vandross \\"Best of Love\\"; Marvin Gaye \\"Marvin turns 60\\"; Michael McDonald \\"Motown Hits\\".
B000B7HZXM|1.0|This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.<br /><br />Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.<br /><br />I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.<br /><br />More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.<br /><br />That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead.
B00005JOYA|5.0|I just got through seeing the matinee this morning. First off, you people who haven't seen this movie yet and are reviewing it need to shut your holes!  I hate people who review movies they haven't seen yet. All of you need your fingers broken off so you cant type up these ridiculous  reviews!  <br />  Anyway, on to the movie: First off,  It is actually a little closer to being a 4 star movie. I just gave it a 5 to offset some of these other bogus reviews. It is the best video game movie sofar, but it is not without its problems. Here are my very MINOR complaints: At time it seems slow, but it does keep you interested. The concept of the mother looking for her child starts to ware thin on you after an hour of watching it. However, there is enough FX, nightmarish scenery, and gore to keep any horror movie fan satisfied. There were actually some pretty cool and unique sequences in this movie. Many of which the previews don't ruin for you. I was very impressed with the violence in this. Most of the other video game movies have been very toned down compared to their game format, but this one holds true to its name. As a matter of fact, toward the end of the movie there is a scene that I will not give away, but I will say I am surprised the movie board let it slip out.  Let's just say mixing violence with children tends to really hit a nerve with your average movie goers. Finally, I must add one final complaint: like all other horror movies released in the last 10 years, bad ending! Well, maybe not bad, but it could have been way better! <br />   Verdict: It is definitely worth a movie ticket, go see it. Its like taking a journey through a nightmare. Great imagination was put into this one. I plan on purchasing it when it comes to DVD. P.S. See \\"The hills have eyes\\" too!
B0009X766Y|5.0|You want to own one of the best...then this is it.  Okay, critics and commentators alike can point out inaccuracies with the setting/music/etc....but it works!  This is the film that brought us all the \\"con\\" movies of today, plus you get great performances by starring and supporting players alike.<br /><br />  If you have been thinking of owning this...all I can say is \\"what has taken you so long?\\"\<br /><br />  Enjoy!a player to injury virtually every week during training ?  You didn't, nor did I, but this kept happening to my players,a dn yes I did play around with the training routines. <br /> <br />To be very honest, I think the game has been rushed in to the shops with out propper testing.  The cut down options (which did not bother me) and text only match (which I prefer) were not the only things to be changed from the PC game in my opinion.  I think the base engine was altered as well, probably optermised to the memory limitations of the PSP, resulting in a buggy engine.  To me, the more I played, the more this game became a joke.  As a result I have now removed it from my PSP. <br /> <br />Now to either wait to the next version of this to come out and hope it is much improved, or time to swap camps to Championship Manager.  Which ever I decide upon, this game is going in to my 'For Sale/Trade In' pile.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|Most people interested in a fantasy movie will have heard of the brothers Grimm and how they collected folk tales and put them into print.  This movie is not about those guys.  These guys do listen to stories but for another reason altogether.  For in the French-occupied Germany, the brothers are interested in pretending to be heroes who defeat monsters, ghosts and witches to gain huge payments from the towns they are supposedly saving.  But the evils are merely their henchmen who arrived early to set the stage. <br /> <br />But things get strange when the local French general (Jonathan Price) gets a hold of them and enlists them to put an end to some other stories.  The problem is that this time the stories may be real.  The brothers move through interesting sets, characters and plots as one would expect from a Terry Gilliam movie.  The story is interesting and the story they are investigating has elements of a number of classic Grimm tales. <br /> <br />As one would expect from the talents behind this film, it is visually stunning.  The story is well paced and the acting really fits.  Jonathan Price is simply excellent and at the top of his form.  The extras are pretty typical and what you would expect but nothing too special.  All in all it was nowhere near the film I was expecting (that became obvious right at the start) but it still managed to grab me and keep me interested.  Check it out.
0553579908|4.0|The strength of this second book is in the way a varied cast of characters is woven into a well told tale, and could justify 4.5 stars. As with the first book, the writing is a bit uneven, but the story engine keeps on keeping on, and I frankly didn't care all that much. If I want deep literary value I'll go read Faulkner. I agree with other reviewers who mentioned Tyrion as a favorite character, and who is a good example of Martin's remarkable talent for creating characters who are appealing and in a peculiar way, realistic for a fantasy novel.
B00005JO20|5.0|Peter Jackson has followed up his wonderful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy with an astounding remake of of King Kong that will leave you spellbound. <br /> <br />Jack Black stars as Carl Denham, a movie producer who is going to make a movie aboard a ship.  However, he secretly wants to find the uncharted Skull Island.  Unfortunately for Carl, his leading lady has disappeared, leaving his movie venture up in the air.  Naomi Watts stars as Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress who has just lost her most recent job due to the closing of the club where she was working.  By chance, Carl and Ann meet, and Carl offers the job of his leading lady role to her.  Ann accepts, and soon the members of the movie crew, including script writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) are on the S.S Venture bound for Singapore; or at least that was the plan. <br /> <br />Filming starts on Carl's movie, but while on board , the ship's captain receives a message that there is a warrant for Carl's arrest.  He is to change his course and head for Rangoon.  However, the ship encounters a dense fog bank and it slams into the rocky coast of an island. Skull Island. <br /> <br />Carl, Ann, Jack, and the others set off to explore the island.  Soon, they run across some blood-thirsty natives who succeed in killing several members of the party.  The ship's captain comes to the resuce in the nick of time, and everyone heads back to the S.S. Venture to prepare to set sail once high tide frees them from the rocks.  But, the natives manage to board the ship undetected and kidnap Ann. <br /> <br />Ann is bound and tied to a wooden rack and offered as a sacrifice to an amazing and mythical creature; a huge gorilla called King Kong.  Kong scoops up Ann in his huge hand and bounds away.  The others aboard the S.S. Venture soon realize that Ann is missing and head back to the island to rescue her.  But, Ann soon realizes that Kong doesn't intend to harm her.  In fact, she begins to like him as well.  But the determined crewmembers are intent on getting Ann back no matter what the cost. <br /> <br />Fierce fighting breaks out on the island as Kong fights against crewmembers and creatures alike, including three T-Rexs who try to kill Ann.  The fight sequence between Kong and the dinosaurs is one of the best sequences of the entire film.  Jack, having had his movie camera smashed to bits during one of the chases, comes up with another idea.  He wants to capture Kong and bring him back to the mainland and make a fortune on admission fees.  With the help of the remaining members of the Venture's crew, they manage to sedate the mighty Kong and bring him back to New York City. <br /> <br />Soon, Jack is standing before a packed auditorium with the curtain drawn.  The curtain goes up, and there is Kong, shackled with heavy iron chains.  Kong is still sedated, so at first he doesn't do too much.  But when he realizes that the girl brought onstage is not Ann, he goes beserk, rips off his chains, and goes on a rampage through the streets of New York.  Meanwhile, at a nearby club, Ann hears the commotion in the streets.  She sees one of Jack's promotional flyers blow by her window, and she immediately knows what's happening.  She walks out into the night to find Kong. <br /> <br />Once together, Ann and Kong somehow end up on an ice skating pond, with Kong laughing and playing on the ice.  However, this carefree moment is short-lived, as the New York National Guard finds them and begins shooting artillery at Kong.  Scooping Ann up in his hand, Kong heads for higher ground, namely, the top of the Empire State Building.  Kong, seeming to know what his ultimate fate will be, scales the building until he reaches the top, all the while carefully carrying Ann in his hand like a newborn.  Once on top and having suffered numerous hits from the guns of airplanes buzzing around them, Kong and Ann share a final, tender moment. <br /> <br />This is a tremendous film, and it deserves much more than five stars.  The special effects are simply out of this world.  The scenes on top of the Empire State Building are the best in the movie, with Kong swatting planes out of the sky like mosquitos.  But beyond the special effects, the story is very good, and touching as well.  The relationship between Kong and Ann is very moving, and you can see how much Kong cares for her by the way he protects her from danger throughout the movie.  The final scene on top of the Empire State Building is probably the most moving scene in the film.  Kong, resigned to his fate, makes sure right up until the very end, that Ann is safe. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The special effects will blow you away, but what will keep you watching is the touching and genuine relationship between a beautiful woman and a large but caring gorilla.  Enjoy.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I don't even know why I'm bothering to put the following information in this review, because it's more or less become common knowledge to A7X fans and haters alike, but for all those unknowing newcomers, I'll put it in: yes, Avenged Sevenfold's style has changed. While their older stuff as heard in \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and \\"Waking the Fallen\\" was mainly metalcore, A7X took the \\"core\\" out of their music and decided to go with straightforward metal, influenced heavily by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. But what I'd like to know is: why are so many people convicting A7X of ditching their old metalcore style for a \\"boring, punk rock-like sound\\"? In reality, their new style is closer to that of classic metal than punk. Most of the people who say this usually know very little about what metal actually is; if they did, they might appreciate this album for how rare a find it is in today's modern metal scene and how much the band has progressed since their debut. The music has changed, there's no denying it, but in my opinion, it's definitely for the better. The same anthemic songs and chugging guitars are still there, but this time they are presented with seemingly less repetition. A7X was always above the rest of the metalcore crowd, and their new album places them even farther up on the list, denouncing their former metalcore roots for a more (dare I say it) accessible sound that even devout metalheads can appreciate.<br /><br />And anyway, the band has very justifiable reasons for their change in style. First and foremost, lead vocalist M. Shadows' vocal cords became damaged after countless shows filled with intense screaming and he had to get throat surgery if he ever wanted to sing again. Following the surgery, he began working with a vocal instructor, and now he does nothing but sing. This can be both a blessing and a curse; a blessing because now his everpresent growls (which actually sounded painful, seeing as they  didn't sound like he trained his voice, most likely leading to his vocal damage) are no longer present, and a curse because this hampers his ability to perform older songs in concert. But still, the screaming in their previous works was somewhat annoying, and the voice coaching he took have done him some good. Also, it seems that, vocal damage or not, A7X had change in mind; an interview with M. Shadows in Alternative Press revealed that he and the band were tired of being heaped up with the other hardcore bands of their caliber and wanted to be more than just another teenage obsession. And I must agree, because there are too many bands with screaming vocals and simple guitar riffs.<br /><br />Now that I've used up half a page on that, I'll get to reviewing the album itself. The guitar style has gone from the chugga-chugga rhythm of American metal to the more complex riffing of European metal (though not to the extremity that the actual European bands use), and solos are more common than ever, with each song displaying at least one by guitarists Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates. The drum parts provided by The Reverend (yes, I know they're slightly tacky names, but the music is good, so I'll let it slide) seem more thought out this time around, with some excellent footwork and drumming that keeps the beat rather than reminding you what the beat is. The bass can't be heard all that well because of the cleaner production, but in those few moments when it becomes obvious (like at the beginning of \\"The Wicked End\\"), it sounds beautiful and soothing. And, last but not least, M. Shadows' vocals are more melodic and clean this time around (but also heavily layered at some points), and the best part is that he actually trained his voice before setting out on this escapade, making his vocals sound like he's actually comfortable singing.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a definite improvement over the last two albums with its wider variety (\\"Sidewinder\\" actually breaks into a pseudo-flamenco part at the end)and larger talent in each individual part. So, before you go judging the band for alienating their fan base (I think the fans are at fault for reacting so negatively), give this CD a listen and try not to focus on the change of style, but instead on the pureness of the music itself. Though most of my early metal bands aren't near the top of my list anymore because I've discovered something of more value to me, Avenged Sevenfold \\"City of Evil\\" still remains in my top 15 favorite metal albums because of its dissimilarity to most other popular American metal bands of our time.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Beast and the Harlot\\", \\"Trashed and Scattered\\", and \\"Strength of the World\\"<br /><br />9/10ach individual part.

B0002UOK04|5.0|Just as I was walking onto my street from school some guy in the passenger seat of a Ford Mustang leans out the side and yells,\\" HAPPY 420!! HEY!!\\" Ho damn I just cracked up and knew that in England, in approximately 1 square kilometer, there were atleast 7 people smoking weed. Anyways here is another almost unheard CD released sometime ago when Green Day just sapped up the fame with their-then newly released American Idiot. However, in order to sap this review of any shame, I won't talk about Green Day anymore. What we are treated with here is simply amazing. Jari was previously in the Viking Metal band Ensiferum, but the schelduled recording of Wintersun and the Ensiferum tour was during the same date. Jari was forced to choose between his booked recording of Wintersun and Ensiferum. He eventually chose Wintersun and was forced to leave Ensiferum behind. In my case, smart move...<br /><br />\\"Beyond The Dark Sun\\" is comprised of strong Power Metal drumming, melodic and catchy riffs rounded out by Death Metal vocals. The guitar work from Jari is pretty amazing. It's flashy, technical, and impressive without going over the top. Things really slow down for the better on \\"Death And The Healing.\\" The folk vibe is well in tact, but musically, things are brought down several notches. Jari's guitar work is really fantastic here because he shows the audience that he doesn't have to play lightning fast to get the job done. It's laid back and you can feel the emotion he puts into it as well.<br /><br />Some of the tracks here tend to get long, but because there is so much going on here it never gets boring. \\"Beautiful Death\\" is just over seven minutes and you would think that in this genre you can't or should go past the four minute mark, but the guys are so talented in composing that there is no time to think of boredom because the tracks only get more beautifully complex and multi dimensional. I think fans of different genres of music will get into this because there is so much to offer. The galloping riffs and beats are plentiful here. Jari and Kai are so talented and handle each instrument with great pride and intelligence. There is nothing lethargic or lagging here. This is Grade A music.<br /><br />Not too forget mentioning about the cover, which grabbed my attention way back in late 2005. The view of a fallen man during Winter's unforgiving reign. The sun shines as brightly as it can, unable to break the void of Winter's punishing atmosphere, wind, and vibe. It is very calm though, with the night fading on and the absence of life. The one thing that creeped me out the most though was that orangish/brownish aura off to the right a distance away from the snow corpse. Something about it just made we wish I wasn't at night out in the woods if I saw it.<br /><br />I never liked too much black metal or very power metal stuff, but this CD has emotion, skill, and talent plundered within. Two men handling the responsibility to create great music for the soul, the mind, and the metalhead. Not just any metalhead...but one who can appreciate the culture and the mind's eye represented not just on this, but in another world that only brings forth epic music.s so much to offer.

B000BTITYY|5.0|I have always enjoyed both Johnny and June. But I was not too interested in their lives. And I have to admit that this film was a bit depressing at first. It reminded me too much of Steinbeck. I started to question my purchase when before I could finish the thought, I was sucked into their life and this movie. This adds a new perspective on the classic songs. We see that they were just people and subject to personalities and environments as we all are.<br /><br />You will find these songs going through your head days after viewing this movie. Note at the ending credits the real thing as the real duo sings \\"Long Legged Guitar Pickin' Man\\"
B000EHRVP6|1.0|THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS    This movie was three parts:  1. Some young American guys and their zany friend being stereotypical horrible and rude tourists just trying to hook up - 40 minutes.  2. The time spent in this cool, torture 'hostel' - 10 minutes.  3. A getaway/chase scene - 30 minutes.    Not only was the only cool part only 10 minutes, but they barely touched on why these people do this.  The only hint that they gave towards one character is because he is a closeted [...].  It was just ridiculous.  It was a let down because it could have been good.
B000E6EHGI|5.0|I can't think of any recording that seemed to give more to me than this one. Many albums are cherished by me from many a great band, but this one is what I most remember from the days of my youth in the 70's.  I played guitar to this endlessly, I cycled it over and over some days (the music literally never stopped).  It carried me off to the sand castles on many an evening.  This GD studio album is about as good as any of their best material in my opinion (I love many other albums of theirs, of course, but this one captured my imagination the most for the journey it takes you on).  I was going to their concerts in the late 70's and this is the highlight material if it made it onto the show any particular evening.  What more intricate material does the Dead have to work with than this?  Older Dead was great, but for this period of their journey, this is a crown jewel.  They really get the collaborative energy going like it may be their last adventure.  Again, what more beautiful instrumental is there than Sage & Spirit in their whole repertoire?  Is there a sweeter and more expressive guitar lead than the Crazy Fingers tearjerker on any studio album?  The build-up of Help/Slipknot/Franklin's Tower into the Roll Away Mantra is like coming out of a dream!  And that jazzy but powerful feedback lead that punctuates the trip is heavenly.  They are on a tear on King Soloman's Marbles, Mahavishnu might fall behind!  All of side one (or even the first six songs) was a perfect transition.  Marbles scattered on a vortex coming together at the end to complete the experience.  Feels like an concept album that flows over you like a wave (it might have been the wind).  This album is inspired to say the least.  Everybodies dancin'!  I will vouch for the weirdness of BFA/Sand Castles, and I like it.  It always feels like that end of a trip feeling when you start noticing all of the sounds around you - you've gone through the vortex to the new space on the other side (with crickets)!  What a trippy little treat The Dead had up their sleeve here.  Like an epiphany and gift for the fans during this wave of the dead story...Let's get to the studio cause we've got somethin' to say!<br /><br />I got this Rhino remastered version of my favorite Dead studio album from the box set (identical to this), and it is the highlight of the bunch!  Not only does the sound quality sparkle, but the extras are really fun, many extended jams featuring Jerry having fun grooving on this or that, or having fun with texture or effects (check out Distorto).  Get out your guitar or whatever and play along, these are a blast -  and thoughtful addition to the material available from this great but kind of obscure period.  There's a band out on the highway, they're HIGHsteppin' into town, it's a rainbow full of sound...the stars were spinnin' dizzy, the band kept us so busy, we forgot about the time...WAS IT EVER HERE AT ALL (The Music Never Stopped)?  Enjoy this treasure, FEEL IT, DON'T ANALYZE IT!!  What a trippy little treat The Dead had up their sleeve here.

B00002MZ4V|5.0|Bottom line up front, this is one of the best John Williams compilations available.  It has not only memorable movie soundtrack songs, but also his music from the Olympics.  While other John Williams music CDs have lots of songs, this one has some of the best variety compared to others.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Thanks to Michael Buble I am proud to say I am a new fan! After hearing his hit Home, I decided to buy this C.D. and I am glad I did. Buble brings a style all its own with such classics from years gone by. \\"Save the Last Dance For Me\\" is a nice rendition. Even \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" should make the Beatles proud. What a talent! You will enjoy the music from this C.D.! Awesome!
B000BC8STM|5.0|Bought it on Amazon and am proud to say that I loved it! Cher never ceases to amaze her fans with outrageous, fantastic and lively performances. I've learned a little bit more about her by watching the Extras at the end of the DVD. It's not the best quality film, and it is dated back to 1991...but seeing this concert on DVD is a true treat to any of Cher's fans both old & new. There's definitely something for everyone, including the \\"Peppy Old Men\\", as Cher puts it.<br /><br />It's fun to see the same gang of people in Cher's entourage back then, as in the \\"Believe\\" and \\"Farewell Tour\\" DVDs. The backup singing is powerful as ever, showing us that Cher & her team only get better with each tour. And of course, Cher never looked so good! Her big hair and sexy peekaboo \\"Nearly-Naked\\" outfits rock! This is definitely my favorite \\"Cher\\" image. My DVD doesn't come with a booklet or liner notes (credits). I'm not sure if the entire batch are like this. The bonus material is fun. I appreciate Cher even more now, than before. Thank You, Cher, for releasing this fab DVD. I knew we could count on you! Cher belts out each song almost exactly as in her studio recordings, yet you can tell she's truly not a lip-syncher or phony.

0440236304|5.0|If you enjoy \\"Band of Brothers\\" movie and book by S. Ambrose then you will enjoy this account equally! This is another \\"troopers\\" version of the life, training and the fighting in Normandy at the time of D-Day. He(Donald Burgett) gives his account of the fighting action, fear and realness of war! It also provides another reasonable historical account of the 101st Airborne D-Day Normandy battles and the weeks that followed. I recommend as a \\"Must Read\\" for the actions of the 101st Airborne in WWII. Burgett also has good books on the actions of 101st Airborne in Holland and Bastogne!

B000002B7M|5.0|To date of writing, there are 2 different versions of 'Blizard of Ozz' avalible on Amazon.com. One is this one, which is the original thing. The other - absolute [...] The bass and drums in all the tracks for it have been replaced so Ozzy wont have to pay his former bandmates royalties.    So again, get this one - the REAL Bliz.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|As many others have said, I'm a devoted van of the 1995 Colin Firth miniseries and my copy of the book is dog-eared from much reading. However, after viewing the movie several more times over the course of the weekend, I've come to like it almost as much as the 1995 miniseries, I think.  The mini-series is good if you are looking for a skillful, faithful, and more complete adaptation of the Darcy-Elizabeth romance.  This version of the story however provides an intriguing artistic take on it - which is good, because a more \\"literal\\" take could never have succeeded in the two-hour-movie format, given the 1995 precedent.  The use of music goes beyond normal soundtracking to become almost operatic in its expressiveness of the emotion.  The essentials of the emotions between Darcy and Elizabeth really come to the fore - which is fine because a two hour movie can't take the time to slowly reveal them w/ the subtlety that the book and the miniseries did.  The chemistry between the two leads is gripping, and the changes to the plot - which mostly amount to changes in the setting (Darcy proposes the first time outside in a rainstorm rather than in the parlor) rather than substance. And though the dialogue was a bit jarring at first since it departs markedly from the book, on further viewings I realize that the writers generally did an excellent job of conveying the essential meanings in fewer and more modern words. <br /> <br />However, for those well-versed with the story bewarned - on first viewing several things about this movie were jarring: the pace (very fast - and not because they cut things out which was inevitable. . . the dialogue is delivered in rapid-fire-succession at points), Elizabeth's demeanor (aggressive independent instead of playful gentile independent), the dialogue (they didn't just modernize the language, they did subtly adapt the *meaning* of some things said in key exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy to make the characters more palpable to modernviewers, I think), and the total evisceration of important side plots (Wickham and Elizabeth's relationship, the presence of the militia in Meryton).   <br /> <br />Still, despite these things, I think they made excellent use of the two-hour movie format.  There wouldn't have been any point in trying to make an extremely faithful but truncated version of the story, because it couldn't have held a candle to the miniseries.  Instead they chose to do something a little different with the story, and I think it works.
B000E6UK32|5.0|If you're already asking yourself, `Do I really need another Blondie compilation?' then I must tell you that the answer is most definitely \\"Yes!\\" This is the most comprehensive collection the band has delivered in their thirty-year history. No, it's not a box set of rarities, it's a two-disc set with one disc of \\"sound\\" that contains their greatest hits of the past three decades and one DVD disc of \\"vision\\" that provides solid proof of why this amazing New York-based band, fronted by Debbie Harry, was recently inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. Of course, the obvious hits are here, beginning with the song that put them on the worldwide map - the #1 smash \\"Heart Of Glass.\\" Other #1 smash records that follow are the Deborah Harry/Giorgio Moroder penned \\"Call Me,\\" the reggae-tinged \\"The Tide Is High\\" and \\"Rapture,\\" which made them the first new wave turned mainstream band to have a #1 rap song, not to mention by a female lead. The widely exposed \\"One Way Or Another\\" is here along with the 1979 classic \\"Dreaming\\" and the 1999 rocker \\"Maria.\\" In between those obvious inclusions are tracks that have become Blondie staples ranging from their 1976 debut single \\"Rip Her To Shreds,\\" through 2003's \\"Good Boys\\" with a new mix added in 2005. Other masterpieces include \\"Atomic,\\" which topped the charts in the UK in 1979, \\"Sunday Girl,\\" a new remix of \\"In The Flesh,\\" \\"Denis,\\" \\"Picture This,\\" \\"Fade Away And Radiate,\\" \\"Hanging On The Telephone,\\" \\"Union City Blue,\\" \\"Island Of Lost Souls\\" \\"End To End\\" and a new single that's burning up the clubs as I write this, \\"Rapture Riders,\\" billed as Blondie VS. The Doors, with the classic 1981 track mixed with the phenomenal Doors' 1971 epic \\"Riders On The Storm.\\" Everything old is brand new again and sounding fresher than ever. The DVD of their performance videos include most of what's on the CD with the inclusion of \\"Detroit 442,\\" and a personal favorite \\"The Hardest Part.\\" The Bonus DVD track is a UK version of the Blondie VS. The Doors' \\"Rapture Riders.\\" It's inevitable that Blondie will one day deliver a box set of hits and rarities in one package, but until they do, pick up this \\"Sound & Vision\\" set, and hear and see why Blondie was, and is, one of the most important rock and roll bands of all-time.oors' \\"Rapture Riders.\\" It's inevitable that Blondie will one day deliver a box set of hits and rarities in one package, but until they do, pick up this \\"Sound & Vision\\" set, and hear and see why Blondie was, and is, one of the most important rock and roll bands of all-time. <br /> <br />

0977728501|4.0|I first saw this film way back in '84 when it got it's UK release and I have to say that it has aged very well (which you can't say about many films made in the 1980's). Yes, there are probably more dramatic and exciting movies out there, but the gentleness and poignancy of this film made it a subtle rarity in the flashy 80's.<br /><br />This is really a modern-day re-telling of the 1940's Brit classic 'Brief Encounter', and it is beautifully done. De Niro and Streep are (as expected) excellent, and they are supported by a fantastic cast (Weist amd Kietel being the most notable). However the best thing is the wonderful score by Dave Grusin (I became a fan thereafter). The piece is called 'Rondo' and can be found on his CD 'Mountain Dance' which is still available). Recommended.

0807818283|5.0|Wilhelm II, Prince and Emperor 1859-1900, was a hostile biography. This is the first of a 2 volume series, so it ends in 1900 even though Wilhelm lived in exile in Holland until 1941. <br /> <br />[The sequel is:  Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900-1941 (Cecil, Lamar) Publisher: University of North Carolina Press (October 1996) ISBN: 0807822833] <br /> <br />We are led to believe that Wilhelm II was a bizarre and incapable sovereign because he didn't work hard, wasn't a good listener, was isolated from outside influences, picked associates for their loyalty, and thought that the government should be composed only of those who agreed with him.  Isn't this a universal set of attributes for all government leaders?   We could have assumed all of the above, and then gone looking for differences that set our subject apart from the pack. <br /> <br />Wilhelm II considered socialists or radicals \\"to be criminals unworthy of his grace and favor.\\"  My guess is that the author has leftist or Anglophile leanings which were the basis for his criticisms of Wilhelm II.  <br />  <br />Wilhelm II was manly and robust, spoke frequently of religious manners, and was polite and friendly as well as very civil in social matters.  Naturally, all of this would be unacceptable to a leftist. <br /> <br />The author faults Wilhelm for being callous in his emotions, and further castigates him for not having a more compassionate feeling about his subjects-but then he also blasts him for allowing momentary impulses and personal feelings to govern his actions.  So, which is it? <br /> <br />Kaiser Wilhelm II planned to ameliorate the condition of the working class, both as a religious duty and as a bulwark against socialism.  He correctly perceived that socialist dogmas were incompatible with Christian ethics and impractical in execution and ruinous to both individuals and society.  And this guy is \\"foolish\\"? <br /> <br />Industrialists were dedicated solely to maximizing profits, and exhibitedno concern for the working class.  Wilhelm wanted a mutually advantageous relationship between employer and worker.  Wilhelm was convinced that if management did not make timely concessions, violence and socialism would result.  He wanted to use the power of the crown to protect workers against unscrupulous employers.  He was sympathetic to the eight-hour day.  The progressive Wilhelm II wanted abolition of Sunday work unless absolutely necessary, no night employment for women and children, no work by women in the last 3 weeks of pregnancy and for a similar period after delivery, a pause in the workday for women to accomplish their domestic chores, and limitation of labor by children under fourteen. <br /> <br />Compared with those of similar position, Wilhelm II was a benevolent and farsighted ruler.   This was a very good book.  Perhaps the author should read it. <br />
B00006CXXU|2.0|Christina Aguilera's voice lately sounds terrible,there are only two good songs on this album which are Make Over and Cruz. I liked these songs on frist listen. I have never been a fan of Aguilera but i give her credit on writing this album. If you're a huge Christina fan, then this album is for you. She's too trampy for me, put your clothes back on girl!
B000060MMI|5.0|Flogging Molly is perhaps the one band that deserves a lot more attention. I didn't even know about these guys untill a friend of mine let me listen to the very first song on this CD, Drunken Lullabies. Since then I was hooked. Each song is great to listen to, and this is a CD worth your money, especially if you get it at Best Buy or Wal-Mart.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs: <br /> <br />\\"Drunken Lullabies\\" 10/10: Best song on the CD [My opinion] sounds like a mix of country with Irish songs in the beginning. Very fast paced and great lyrics to listen to. <br /> <br />\\"If I Ever Leave This World Alive\\" 9/10: Slow tune but very nice to listen to, especially if you want a time to relax and just listen to good music. <br /> <br />\\"The Kilburn High Road\\" 9/10: Another song that is fast paced to listen to. Everyone sings in this song as the chorus comes up.  <br /> <br />\\"We're The Rebels of The Sacred Heart!!!\\" 10/10: Another song that starts off slow but really picks up. At five plus minutes long this is one great song. Love the ending! <br /> <br />\\"Another Bag of Bricks\\" 8/10: Not one of my great favorites, but a good song to listen to once in a while. <br /> <br />\\"The Son Never Shines [On Closed Doors]\\" 9/10: Slow paced all the way through, but a nice touch to end the CD. Listen to this at the very last, because that is when it is most effective.  <br /> <br />Don't think the other songs are bad, these are just my personal favorites. You might find the other songs better than mine, but you need to go out and buy this CD so you can compare!!! <br /> <br />Highly Recommended...
0393317552|1.0|I quit reading this book about halfway through because I became so frustrated at the author's style.  It's obviously appropriate for authors to have biases (we all do), but when writing a factual history based on substantial research those biases should not be so evident.<br /><br />Mr. Diamond (from UCLA) is too apparent.  How can he write that some island societies had no organized communities, yet at the same time say they \\"renounced war\\"?  How and why would an unorganized community having no contact with other communities \\"renounce war\\"?  Also, can we really say that one of the primary reasons that more developed societies defeated the hunter-gatherers is because the developed societies had religious leaders to justify war?  It's perfectly acceptable to be a peace activist or to be very skeptical of religious believers (viewpoints that I am very confident are held by Mr. Diamond), but having those perspectives be so evident in what is supposed to be a factual history greatly discounted the validity of this book for me.  There are many other examples I could share of Mr. Diamond unnecessarily injecting into history what appeared to me to be his personal left-wing biases.<br /><br />Mr. Diamond's premise that geography, and then 'guns, germs, and steel', overwhelmingly influenced the course of history seems well-founded to me ... but I will take away nothing other than that from this book.
B000002LKU|5.0|One of my favorite CDs. I purchased this CD when it first came out in something like 1990. I never tire of the CD and put in rotation in my vehicle CD player every few months. it usually stays there even when I change all the other CDs. <br />Not sure how true it is, but I heard that at the time this CD was made, that, other than Mark Knopfler, the other members of this group were Nashville studio musicians. They are plenty good at what they do, both singing and playing music. <br />Great CD, I just wish they would have made some more music together.
B00008438V|5.0|My best friend Are made me see EVERY teenage-film on VCR or in the theatre in the 80s....At least that`s how I feel about it hehehe...<br /><br />This was 1 of his favorites and looking back on it is is simple fun because it takes me back to my youth, my memories of it - and the bunch of films we saw with the Brat Back(Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, Kiefer Sutherland, C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio and so on)...<br /><br />On its own it may seem silly for a first timer, but for me it was and is  pure magical unspoilt fun:-)
B000001ESF|5.0|After the utter failure of the album CARESS OF STEEL Rush really had their backs against the wall, and basically they knew they needed a brilliant and powerful statement to make, to bring them back to respectability, and 2112 fitted the bill nicely, and kept them afloat in the world of rock music. The side long track 2112 is the best side long song, and the arguably the best concept song ever (at least it is to me). Every movement is brilliant and it really tells a great kind of a sci-fi story. Brilliant, just brilliant! The second side (for you who remember vinyl albums) is superb also. This is one of the few albums where Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson wrote the lyrics to a couple of songs. Alex wrote &quot;Lessons&quot;, which is one of my favorite Rush songs ever. Geddy wrote &quot;Tears&quot;, which is a great soft ballad that is pretty moving indeed. Then, the other three are penned by Neil, and they are &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Something For Nothing&quot;, and &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot;. I guess that Neil and the boys were real connoisseurs of pot, as you can tell from &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot;. That kind of makes it look like pot smoking is cool, which I thought was cool when I was in highschool because I was smoking it then, but now that I got off the stuff over twelve years ago, it kind of bothers me, but what can you do. That would be the only blemish on the entire album, but the music of the song is very good. &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Something For Nothing&quot; are two of the very best Rush songs ever. This could be the best Rush studio release to start your collection, but you might also consider MOVING PICTURES and PERMANENT WAVES. Happy listening!!!<br /><br />P.S.- Are you guys giving me unhelpful votes on my review because I mentioned something about not liking the words to &quot;Passage to Bangkok&quot; because of the glorification of pot. That was just a little gripe, so go off in the corner and smoke that wacky tobbacy, and stop getting your panties in bunch!, and stop getting your panties in bunch!
B000E97Y6K|4.0|King Kong was a good movie the special effects were a little better than I thought they would be but not as good as War of the Worlds (best F/X ever). Yes, I did think it was a little long but I think the 2h 57m was worth it. It is a really fun movie and at some points touching. Once they get on the island it is non stop action from the Dinasuar stampede to Kong fighting the T-Rex's to the crew fighting really gross bugs to Kong running around old time New York. Overall I gave it a B+ check it out.
B00005YIPM|3.0|I would give this album 5 stars as it deserved it musically. But this is a well known example of a poor recording (mastering) effect. From its original source this album was poorly recorded (what a sin!) so if you are expecting this album to be your reference album to showcase your system abilities and the sacd techonology be aware that it will give you a bad surprise. The audible distortion is evident and it shows. I think its better to have this album on a regular CD, you are not going to gain practically nothing having it in a superior format, only revealing more its recording mistakes. The version I have heard that most satisfies me sonically speaking is the 200 gram super vinyl version, fwiw.
B00000B9BD|5.0|This excellent 1972 release by the Strawbs is much proggier/rockier sounding than From the Witchwood (1971), with electric instruments outweighing acoustic instruments.  The lineup at this point no longer included Rick Wakeman, who had (rather abruptly) joined Yes.  Apparently Dave Cousins was very upset by the way Rick left the band, which was expressed in the angry-sounding track Tomorrow.  In addition to Dave Cousins (vocals acoustic/electric guitars, dulcimer) the other players on the album include the superb keyboardist Blue Weaver (mellotron, Hammond organ, harmonium, clavioline); John Ford (bass, vocals); Tony Hooper (guitars, vocals); and Richard Hudson (drums).  The overall sound of the album is dark and features plenty of brooding mellotron parts and a few delicate, folk-flavored acoustic pieces (Hey Little Man...Wednesday's Child).  The track Grave New World is the best example of gloom and doom on the album and is simply loaded with mellotron (w/string setting) - it is my favorite piece on the album in fact.  On the other side of the equation is some brisk Hammond organ work - Blue Weaver certainly gives Wakeman a run for his money on the track Tomorrow; aggressive bass parts played on a very trebly Rickenbacker bass; rocking electric guitar work; and some heavy drumming.  In general though, the heaviness is not overbearing in any way.  Although Dave Cousins certainly has an unusual voice, I actually find it very listenable.  The three and four part vocal harmonies are also very nice - the folk inflected vocal harmonies on The Flower and the Young Man are especially good.  Although prog, folk and rock styles predominate, there are Indian influences as well (Is It Today, Lord?), along with a bit of silliness.  Specifically, the track Ah Me, Ah My is silly in a Monty Python, barbershop quartet way and really does not fit with the heavy gloom that characterizes most of the material.  This is a minor complaint however, and does not affect the quality of the listening experience. The remastering of the album is generally pretty good and features improved sound quality (although the bass is screaming), along with detailed liner notes and restored cover art. The bonus tracks Here it Comes and I'm Going Home are not especially good. Overall, this is a wonderful Strawbs album and is recommended along with From the Witchwood (1971); Hero and Heroine (1974); and Ghosts (1975).listening experience.

0553804367|3.0|I came upon this book because I recall the bestseller has a similar name, \\"A Brief History of Time\\".  According to the flap, this is a concised version of the original, which is so much the better since in any piece of non-fiction, we just want to extract the knowledge from it as fast as possible, yes?  This is also an updated version of the bestseller since it has been some time since the original was published.<br /><br />All in all, it was a very good summary of the major findings in physics and astronomy.  A good review of what you learned in high school or college.  It is probably a little bit dry for normal readers and at times may be hard for the average reader to understand such technical concepts.  But on the same light, there is no way to really explain in layman's terms.  So kind of a dilemma here.  Sometimes I would have to reread portions of the book to better understand it, other times I just skimmed through it and hope my subconscious got it...ha.  Again, the beginning documents the history of physics and astronomy so it may be boring for some who have learned it in school or if you are in school already it would not be anything new.  The last two chapers are quite interesting though, especially the chapter on Wormholes and Time Travel.  It is hard not to think about movies that are based on the logic presented in the book.  I would recommend it to anyone thinking of writing something creative like a screenplay.  This book has potential for many interesting ideas for a good sci-fi story.  On the whole, it is a good read, however I still find it a little bit too technical and hard to digest at the same time.  Have fun.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Probably Yes' second best offering as a complete album, next to Close to the Edge. Sure, no Bruford, no Wakeman, but Alan White and Patrick Moraz hold their own here. I think I may actually like Moraz better than Wakeman...a little jazzier, but still an excellent, classically-trained keyboardist with as many (or more) keyboards as Wakeman. Howe's guitarwork is great, some of his best work, and Squire's sweet basslines and Anderson's soaring tenor vocals sound as good as ever. The epic \\"Gates of Delirium\\" is one of Yes' greatest long tracks, with possibly the most intense instrumental section of any Yes song. It's up there with \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"The Revealing Science of God\\". \\"Sound-chaser\\" is a daring tune, even for Yes, but is a great tune that really rocks in the middle sections. 'To Be Over' is a great ballad, in the style of \\"And You and I\\", very beautiful. In my opinion, progressive rock fans should not be without any of Yes' albums between 'The Yes Album' and 'Going for the One', Yes' last truly great album. This music is quite indulgent, but fans of great music, made by great musicians, for the sake of music, should definitely get this.   This edition features some extra tracks, but these don't really add much to the album (in fact, they sort of break up the feel and continuity of the album). Still, this remastering sounds great, includes some nice photos, lyrics and liner notes. A huge sonic step up from the original Atlantic release from 1990.  Yes \\"newbies\\" will probably want to start off with a compilation, or 'Fragile' or the 'Yes Album'...if you like what you hear there, then get 'Close to the Edge', and then get this album.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|My family enjoyed watching this when it came out on DVD.  However, there's no rush to watch this one the way there is to watch the original.  Who could top Gene Wilder?  And if the music's catchy, the kids take to it.  Sure, the original had a few cheesy effects but at least it did get a treatment from the author of the book, Roald Dahl.  What this one lacks are all the sly one-liners that Wonka throws out there, and of course the memorable \\"Good day, SIR!\\"
B000EGCITG|1.0|Let me tell you something about this CD: BLAND, BORING, and TOTALLY FORGETABLE. Just a bunch of noise and insipid lyrics with no type of melodies. I've heard *way* better pop albums.  Pink is no different and no better than anyone else out there right now. I don't even know why she came back- no one really missed her. Maybe I would take her seriously if she played an instrument and wasn't hypocritical and boastful. Why cry about \\"the homeless in the streets\\" in \\"Dear Mr. President\\" and then boast about your rims, diamonds, and someone's house fitting in your swimming pool in \\"Cuz I Can\\"? Since Pink is concerned about the homeless, she should invite them to live with her in her big house and ride in her expensive whips. Skip this juvenile album from this Janis Joplin wanksta at all costs.
B0000CDL93|4.0|<br />MY IMPRESSION - - INCREDIBLY WELL DONE DRAMATIZATION: BUT WHERE EXACTLY IS THE TRUTH?  <br /> <br />To evaluate this film fairly is like evaluating the book \\"State of Fear\\". If one agrees with the Author/Director's conclusions, the film or book is great. If not, it is garbage or worse, in one's opinion. I have chosen to treat both of these as prime examples of fictionalization. In that light, this film is terrific entertainment and does indeed get people thinking and politicians worrying.  <br /> <br />A FICTIONALIZED INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS - -  <br /> <br />Of course, it is a shame that everything in the book is not pure fact. Watching this film, one becomes certain that Clay Shaw, played by Tommy Lee Jones in an Oscar-winning role, was certainly guilty as sin. After all, we all but saw him commit the crime. Jim Garrison played deftly by Kevin Costner proves every point including Clay Shaw's perjury as we see the answers to the questions Garrison is asking in flashback form which is followed by Shaw telling yet another lie. The same style is used with John Candy's character Dean Andrews answering the question, \\"Did you ever met Clay Shaw?\\", with, \\"I never met the dude\\", while he asks for more cashews from Shaw in a simultaneous flashback. Oliver Stone uses this flashback device as a sort of lie detector for the viewers' benefit and entertainment throughout the film to reinforce his point. The benefit is the immediate comprehension of the point that Stone wants to make, but the entertainment value is the more lasting one. In essence, watching these scenes over and over is just as comedic each time but as one gets familiar with the facts [as they are being presented], one can both see the flaws in the argument and be drawn to collecting the facts oneself from more objective sources. If only Stone had been a little more objective with his arguments/facts, this film would have been a great gift to humankind instead of just great entertainment for film fans/JFK conspiracy theorists.  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE 2 DISK DVD SPECIAL EDITION:  <br /> <br />There are scenes in this DVD that are not on the VHS or theatrical releases. These additions make much of the rapid-fire quasi-facts presented during the Garrison explanations at trial make more sense. Widescreen helps too, as this ensemble cast does not quite fit in full frame in some sequences.  <br /> <br />FEATURES: THIS DIRECTOR'S CUT 2-DISK SET IS WORTH THE DIFFERENCE!  <br /> <br />Deleted scenes are usually best left deleted. This film is no exception as they really slow things down, but they do add understanding to the heart of the film's premise. There is also a thought-provoking feature which details what the Congress has done regarding looking into this matter (JFK's assassination) after this film's release.  <br /> <br />-- * ABRIDGED LIST OF THE CAST -- *  <br /> <br />Kevin Costner - Jim Garrison  <br />Sissy Spacek - Liz Garrison  <br />Joe Pesci - David Ferrie  <br />Tommy Lee Jones - Clay Shaw  <br />Gary Oldman - Lee Harvey Oswald  <br />Michael Rooker - Bill Broussard  <br />Jay O.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This is by far the best cd I have ever listened to.  I first really listened to a Green Day song a about a month ago when Fuse (ch. 339) had that big \\"marathon\\" of Green Day stuff.  I rewatched the \\"Making of American Idiot\\" about 30 times before I finally decided to buy the cd, but then I couldn't find it.  So when I went out of state a made a point to find it somewhere, and I am so glad that I did.  It's in my cd player almost constantly, unless I'm listening to one of their other cd's.  I listened to it the entire time I was in C.A. and the entire way back to washington (that's over 1000 mi. in case you were wondering) and I haven't gotten tired of it.  The way that they structured the cd so that it tells a story is flawless, and there are no songs that just don't fit.  It's perfect.
0375831002|5.0|I just finished a haunting novel called \\"The Book Thief\\".  The title<br /><br />character reminds me of an Anne Frank<br /><br />(in that she writes of experiences no young person should have), on the German side.  The novel makes you<br /><br />realize if you didn't already (Seeing the Plotzensee memorial in Berlin<br /><br />which is where Germans who didn't agree with Hitler were executed made me<br /><br />realize that there were many who resisted Nazism), that many Germans were<br /><br />good, ordinary people who suffered a lot especially if they didn't agree<br /><br />with Hitler. The book is fiction, but is inspired by stories told to the<br /><br />author by his grandparents.  The characters will stay with me a long time,<br /><br />especially Hans, who becomes a wonderful father to a little girl (the title<br /><br />character) who was sent to live with him and his wife because her father who<br /><br />was a Communist had been sent to a concentration camp and her mother was<br /><br />destitute and no longer able to care for her. Hans and his wife Rosa who is<br /><br />the proverbial tough cookie with a heart of pure gold,  also shelter a young<br /><br />Jew who is the son of a  friend of Hans who had died in WWI and who had<br /><br />taught Hans to play the accordion.  Hans also gives bread to a Jew who is<br /><br />being marched through the street with a group of prisoners from Dachau. He<br /><br />is beaten and drafted into the German army and given the dirty job of<br /><br />propping up buildings that have been bombed and unearthing and disposing of<br /><br />the dead after the bombings.<br /><br />Through it all Hans remains the kind decent person and the beloved foster<br /><br />father of the book thief, who calls him 'Papa' and loves him best in the<br /><br />world. The book thief  steals books from the mayor's house, aided by the<br /><br />mayor's wife, a woman damaged by the early death of her only son, who leaves<br /><br />the window open so that the girl can enter. The books which she begins<br /><br />reading with the assistance of Hans, who cannot read very well himself, but realizes<br /><br />the importance of the books to the girl, help her  to escape from the<br /><br />horrors which are a part of their daily life.  The books and Hans' accordion playing begin the bond between Hans and his adopted daughter which becomes as strong as if Hans had been her birth father. The reading of the books give her and the young<br /><br />Jew with whom she shares them, as well as a cranky neighbor, a refuge from<br /><br />the chaotic world in which they must exist.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Wow, what an amazing visual film. Being someone who loves cinematography and artwork in general, I acquired this film quickly after hearing about it. I wasn't disappointed, except for the story which was just so-so. <br /> <br />Almost the whole film is computerized and almost has a painting-like look to it. In fact, many scenes look as if Edward Hopper had painted them. Yet, it is a live-action movie with real actors whose faces aren't altered, except for Gywneth Paltrow's hair which is made more blondish and shimmering. <br /> <br />Story-wise, it's nothing special, just a corny old-time serial story about someone using high-tech robots and spaceships to take over the planet. The time period, however, is pre-World War II so to see this futuristic type of robot is a bit of a stretch. Nonetheless, it's a strictly old-fashioned sci-fi story with little profanity and, except for the robots, a great retro look. <br /> <br />Going back to that \\"look,\\" this film is still very worthy of viewing because it's absolutely stunning to see. There truly is nothing quite like it. I'm sorry it didn't do well at the box office because that won't encourage others to make more of these visually-inventive kind of films. This must look beyond incredible on an expensive plasma TV set! <br /> <br />Also notable is the sound. The better the sound system you have, the more you will be blown away with the audio here. It's as good as the visuals. If only the story was as good!  <br />
B00003CXAW|5.0|Possibly one of the best movies ever made.  The origional 33 version has always been the best, Kong is more of a beast, true he has a soft side for the blonde of his dreams.  But the new 2005 version has a more passive Kong than this origional.  But what am i saying the origionals are always better.  This is Kong remastered as you've never seen it before, amazing set amazing movie!
B00006DEF9|5.0|This is one of those handful of films that is universally loved and respected and I have to join the crowd on that. For over 50 years it has been considered the best musical ever made and I can't argue with that, either, especially with the newly- restored DVD version that came out a short time ago. The film never looked and sounded better! <br /> <br />In a nutshell, the reason for the high praise, I would think would be: 1 - Likable lead characters (Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor); 2 - Excellent song-and-dance numbers, capped off by one of the most famous of all-time, the title song \\"Singin' In the Rain,\\" featuring Kelly; 3 - Very good humor throughout the film, aided by Jean Hagen's dumb blonde imitation, which may be the best ever put on film; 4 - Spectacular color (please get this latest 2-disc DVD), and 5 - of course, simply a very entertaining film start-to-finish. <br /> <br />A few side comments: Kelly gets the legacy with his title song dance but O'Connor's dancing in here is just as good. In fact, one of his solo routines reportedly exhausted him so much he could not work for five days. A nice bonus is seeing Cyd Charisse in here, showing off her dancing skills and great legs.  <br />
B000063JDE|2.0|Blue Velvet, adored by all gothics, S&M enthusiasts, and geeky, self-described (i.e., uneducated) 'film buffs,' leaves you with the same exasperation and puzzlement endemic to David Lynch films.  Proponents of Blue Velvet will tell you that it explores the 'dark side' of everyday life, what mainstream America doesn't really want to address...don't buy into it.  Lynch's vision cannot stand in for anything that most of us will ever experience, and its absurd exaggerations drive the point home.  Perhaps the problem is watching this movie with twenty years worth of perspective, or maybe it was always this mediocre; whatever the case, Dennis Hopper is more overdramatic than scary, and (again, as is the m.o. of Lynch) the plot is hardly satisfying.  The characters make irrational choices, with absolutely no explanation (why does Laura Dern suddenly forget that her new boyfriend has been sleeping with the psychotic woman they have been watching?).  The final scene is particularly troubling...not because it 'shakes the foundations of cinema and everyday life,' but because it plays out without any coherence (the shady detective standing in the apartment, with no explanation for why he is suddenly immobile?).   <br />If you've seen Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, you will not be surprised by the seemingly arbitrary confusion Lynch too often indulges.  Whereas other experimental filmmakers seem to have a point to make with their choices, one has the feeling that Lynch instead constructs a pseudo-mystery without bothering to let the audience ever understand.  In all fairness, at the time of Blue Velvet Lynch had not yet reached the stage of simply throwing unconnected and unexplained plot twists into his film; still, most viewers will be left wondering what the hell they just watched, and why it has been canonized in American cult-cinema.
B00005JNQS|4.0|Animated movies are usually pretty good but nothing that great to me. However, this one is a \\"keeper.\\" It gets high marks for all the jokes in here, lots of which are adult-style but not sleazy or filled with sexual innuendos, although there are a few of those, enough to make this PG, not G. However, the vast amount of clever lines is the main attraction here. <br /> <br />Actually, the jokes come so hard and fast, it's hard to keep up with all of them. The visuals aren't gorgeous, as many modern-day animated films have become, but they are interesting. Not only is there a ton of gags to hear, but there are to see, too. You almost have to stop it frame-by-frame to see all the funny stuff penciled in the artwork. <br /> <br />The story couldn't be simpler but it manages you keep your attention and doesn't overstay it's welcome, although I think animated films are more effective it they don't go over 80 minutes. This one is closer to 90. <br /> <br />There is a good message in here, too. Maybe I'm mistaken but what I heard was the idea that just because people might be old, decaying and not as productive for society, it doesn't mean you have to discard them. Life has value and is precious from conception to dying of old age. Amen to that!  <br />
B000002H97|3.0|I love this album for that 1 really great song, Enter SANDMAN... <br />and it is one of my favorites of all time. 3 stars because Enter <br />Sandman is the best......BUY IT. <br />
0800141660|4.0|Wow, here's an emotional story that gets you involved and wears you out by the end. I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals. <br /> <br />Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson (see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End). Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it.  <br /> <br />It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing, too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom, Titantic. <br /> <br />One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British, you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England, in which this story takes place. The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen, on both the inside and outside scenes. It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score, too. <br /> <br />This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it's still very much worth seeing, and adding to one's DVD collection. It''s great film-making.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This album is one of the very best. I love each and every song on this. Each and every song rocks AND THE LYRICS ARE GREAT. If you don't have this album buy it now with Making movies, and On Every street and remember Dire Straits have lots of talent.
B00005UK1F|5.0|I realize a lot of people give extra high ratings to concept albums, especially single song concept albums. Most of the time the ratings are totally undeserved. However, this album really is interesting. I was very skeptical because with the exception of Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick, most of these projects fall woefully short of a 5 star rating.  <br /> <br />In all honesty, so does this recording. It isn't an \\"absolute, must have or your life will be unfulfilled\\" kind of recording. However, it is better than most skeptics like myself would have thought. Even my \\"metal-phobic\\" friends and co-workers enjoyed this effort. It's got enough metal to have a bite when needed and enough prog to draw you into their world. I've only listened to the album 7 times since buying it a couple weeks ago, so I'm not too deeply involved into the lyrics and story. Then again, I rarely pay attention to lyrics unless they are audaciously bad.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to go into minute by minute detail other than to say as others have said that the female vocalist's solo in the middle of the song is not only bad, but it is also out of place and ill-fitting the rest of the music. Personally, I ripped this into a sound editor, removed that section, and reassembled the track. That alone puts it in the 4.5 star category. All in all, this is well worth the $12 investment and will definitely provide a lot of musical enjoyment in the years to come.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones aren't a punk band. They are a hard rock heavy metal band. And all the songs on this album are heavy metal style. Joey <br />Ramone still sings the same voice though Johnny Ramone plays electric heavy metal guitar. The Ramones were always a rock and roll band.
B0000CC61G|5.0|After a few months of searching, I was finally able to get a copy of this album. It's the digi-pack version with the bonus track to make things even better. If you are a fan of symphonic prog, especially the styling's of Genesis and King Crimson, this is THE album for you. Here is a band that knows their influences, but offers their own unique take on things. The Swedish folk overtones add a dimension that helps to make the compositions unique to the giants of '70's prog.  <br /> <br />The musicianship is almost startling, even more so when you consider the age of the band members (all under 24). The drumming is what struck me first and foremost. The drumming is both utterly complex and amazingly delicate depending on the mood the band is trying to achieve. And speaking of moods, Anglagard switches time signatures and musical styles with blinding speed and dexterity. Music this complex is rarely shown on a debut release. And yet, they have the uncanny maturity to make all that complexity musical. This isn't just complex for the sake of showing off, they are very cognoscente of this being music and not a mathematical exercise.  <br /> <br />I'm simply in awe of this band; one listen to Jordrok and I was hooked. Now I would consider it my absolute favorite instrumental, even more so than La Villa Strangiato. That's something I never thought I'd say. If I could give this album 6 stars; I would. I honestly don't think you can be a serious symphonic prog fan without a copy of this album. Hybris is that good and that important.

0736063684|5.0|At one point I thought I knew what I needed to know to benefit from regular weight-lifting.  I'd look forward to new editions of Men's Health in order to learn about new exercises to help motivate myself.  Thanks to this book, I've realized just how little I really knew, and I can get the motivation of a new exercise or a fresh workout every time I pick this book off the shelf.  In fact on cold, dark, early mornings it is frequently in my hands, motivating me to get out the door to the gym before work.<br /><br />I would agree with previous reviewers - the diagrams are excellent and educational.  Also, the sections on weight-lifting injuries (and how to avoid them) are invaluable.<br /><br />I feel like I should mention that this is the only weight-lifting book I've ever purchased - it is the first and only title I've ever needed.P500 runs rings around my old HP D145, even with the lack of a copier feed, this is a great bit of kit.    My MP500 is about to run out of colour ink, but I have printed off over 100, high resolution A4 photo's for work.    All in all, I'll get back my money on this soon. It is a bit of a dust magnet, but it's black and it does the job well. I am impressed with this printer.

B000BT97AO|5.0|MirrorMask (Dave McKean, 2004)<br /><br />All hail MirrorMask, and just after you're done, spend some time wondering why on earth this film didn't get much wider distribution. Just having the names of Sandman collaborators Neil Gaiman (Neverwhere) and Dave McKean (his feature film debut) would seem to imply a pretty good drawing power at the theater, and its run on the American art house circuit was-- given that it played on a grand total of forty-one screens in America in its widest release-- an unqualified success. And yet, if you lived outside the \\"selected cities\\" you always hear about in TV commercials, you never got the chance to see it until it popped up on DVD. Well, now it's on DVD, and I cannot recommend strongly enough that you see it at you earliest opportunity.<br /><br />Helena (Benath the Skin's Stephanie Leonidas) is fifteen, the child of a husband-and-wife team who run a circus. She's tired of the itinerant lifestyle and wants to settle down. Just after she and her mother, Joanne (Gina McKee, recently in The Divine Secretsof the Ya-Ya-Sisterhood), argue, Joanne collapses and is rushed to the hospital. The night the doctors have some exploratory surgery planned, Helena wakes up from a fitful sleep and finds herself in another world, where she and her newfound companion Valentine (Beyond Re-Animator's Jason Barry) have to save the world from sliding into dissolution.<br /><br />McKean, who's well-proven his wide-ranging and dramatic artistic vision with the graphic novel Cages, takes things up a notch here. I was expecting something as somber as Cages or the more somber moments of Sandman, but MirrorMask isn't it; it's far jauntier than I expected from Gaiman and McKean, with liberal touches of whimsy in among the pervasive darkness. It's your basic quest storyline done up in the most wonderfully visually arresting of ways. As a cult kids' flick, it's certainly on the level of, say, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory; about the closest adult analogue I can come up with is The City of Lost Children, with a dash of Dark City for good measure. McKean has created an adventure tale that is in every way impressive. See this. **** ?analogue I can come up with is The City of Lost Children, with a dash of Dark City for good measure.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|Jarhead (Sam Mendes, 2005)<br /><br />First off: for those of you who haven't yet seen it, despite what the trailers imply, Jarhead is not your typical soldiers-in-wartime movie. It's not a soldiers-in-peacetime movie; either; it's about that period of \\"hurry up and wait\\" the we called Operation Desert Shield.<br /><br />Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a marine. No one, least of all him, knows why. (\\"I got lost on the way to college, sir!\\") He survives boot camp and, after some training, ships off to the desert for Desert Shield, where there was little to do but play tricks on reporters, watch war movies, and slowly go insane. Swofford and his seven teammates do a lot of all three.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this movie is, basically, about nothing, it's very well done. Mendes brings in some of the out-of-touch-with-reality vibe that made American Beauty such a fun movie and combines it with a very, very wrong humor. It's all the insanity of Apocalypse Now-- a film to which it wears its debt naked on its sleeve-- without all the things blowing up. Gyllenhaal is supported by a fine cast of others, including Jamie Foxx (who's really come into his own as a dramatic player), Peter Sarsgaard, and Evan Jones, who looks more like Flea with each passing day.<br /><br />Fun, even-- especially, perhaps-- if you're not a fan of war movies. *** ?
B00005221M|4.0|...I have seen this movie. And I can tell you that this is a very good movie. There is something for everyone here. Action, adventure and romance. The movie takes place during the French and Indian War here in America and is a tale of revenge, love, loyalty and war. The movie has a slow start as it brings the viewer up to speed as to who the charectors are but when the action starts it starts and continues on with its ebb and flow at a good pace. If you want a movie that will statisfy you then this movie is it.
0375831002|5.0|as you can tell from the reviews below it is an awesome book.<br /><br />At first i had little faith in this book considering that the point of view this book is written is foggy and unclear, but i see now it brings the book together at the end.<br /><br />Liesel is pretty much and orphan when she reaches Hans & his wife. he brother dies on the train ride there, she has never known her farther, and her mother is taken away by 'them'. through out the duration of the book, you are always wishing Rudy, the boy next door and liesel's best friend will get the damn kiss! so when i hit the last couple of chapthers that hinted toward his death i cried! i have never cried readin a book before, but it was just that good. Max,the Jex, quickly became my favorite supporting charater after Hans; The only papa Liesel'd ever known.<br /><br />this book had...not a dissapointing ending, but one no one see's comming nor one that any one with a heart wants.<br /><br />THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK I'VE EVER READ AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN DO BETTER!!!!
0966247809|5.0|Après des années de censure, l'ultime oeuvre de Pasolini nous revient comme une gifle ou comme un boomerang. Il faut prendre très au sérieux ce qu'en a dit l'auteur lui-même avant d'petre assassibé puis hideusement caricaturé. Ce film n'est ni un hommage à Sade ni une dénonciation tard venue du fascisme mussolinien. Il prophétise ce que la société de consommation est en passe de faire à nos jeunes, un fascisme \\"soft\\"... au moins dans un premier temps... Exemplaire à cet égard la deuxième partie, \\"le cycle de la merde\\": car à force de leur en faire ingurgiter au sens métaphorique (gadgets, télé-réalité, sous-vulture abêtissante...) notre société ne fait pas mieux que ceux que nous voyons ici leur en faire bouffer pour de bon. Les voyeurs et les profiteurs sont toujours les mêmes. Les quelques figures de la révolte qui émergent, tel le jeune homme nu qui lève le poing face à la mitraille, n'en sont que plus significatives. A noter l'exceptionnelle qualité des bonus, vraiment utiles à une compréhension distanciée de l'ensemble.
B00005JO20|5.0|The remake of King Kong .. is more than good, it! great movie watching. I love it & I like it, Kong .. was super & I feel so much for him. He was almost human. But , I miss Fay Wray, alot, she was the one King Kong loved in King Kong of 1933 movie but, again it works well & well done as a remake. I still , like the 1933 King Kong the best. Why? Well .. I grow up with as a kid & kids never forget a movie they love. Both are great .. so take time & watch them both & have a fun time watching. Give Them both 5 stars .. as great movies .....
B000E97HIA|4.0|During the eighties Prince was called the black Mozart. A comparison he earned with his eccentric behavior and elective approach to music. His eighties albums were at times strokes of genius and always original. Prince never repeated himself and always managed to be a pleasant surprise. He managed to combine the experimental and the commercial like no other, often managing to write beautiful pop songs in the process. At the time he was the leader of the pack.    Those days, sadly, are no more. During the nineties his career slowly started to decline. This wasn't all because of his feud with Warner brothers and his name change. Part of it was simply his output. Prince seemed determent to prove he still mattered as an artist. Often firing one tiresome concept album after another at us. Each effort seemed more forced than the one before. When Prince decided to become a Jehova witness his career seemed over and done with. In 2004 he took us by surprise with Musicology. A loose and funky album of the kind he hadn't produced since his excellent pop-soul album Diamond and Pearls. Nothing groundbreaking  but very pleasant and joyful. Prince seemed to have found his muse. Apart from the loosely structured funk jams there were fine pop efforts as well.    3121  finds Prince continuing this trajectory. With Musicology al lot of us felt that it could be an one off lucky streak. With his new album he proves he is quite capable again. Prince seems to have stopped trying to reinvent himself with every effort. It seems as though he now realizes than one can do that only so many times. On 3121 we find a very relaxed Prince relying heavenly on his strengths. This means that there are loose funk jams just as on Musicology and very well crafted pop songs. The songwriting is lighthearted and offbeat, imaginative and naughty. Something he didn't accomplish in a long time. Although he isn't as explicit as he used to be, Blacksweat and Lolita are among the sexiest songs he's written. The synth chops are a nice throwback to the start of his career. The album looses some of its appeal near the end. Get on the Boat and the Dance are not among his most original compositions. But by then it doesn't matter anymore. Prince is back!
B000ERU6QC|4.0|Boys Good news!!!! Eagles Of Death Metal are back!!!!!! this time the formula seems to be reduced to Jesse and Josh only but the result is still Eagles Of Death Metal , perhaps a little colder than Love, Sex, Death metal, the duo offers a collection of songs that goes from hard to pop, from Heavy to Southern with funny lyrics, funny vocals and music not overproduced at all, this is an album to enjoy completelly without thinking really hard on the concept that this duo offers, put it on your equipment and they will do the rest <br />HM
1594200653|5.0|This is a very superior book in an inferior genre: the overview of modern European history (usually aimed at the first-year student set).  I read a whole bunch of these as a student, but I haven't opened one in lots of years: the nearest was Mark Mazower's Dark Continent, which isn't really the same sort of thing.  Nevertheless, I found Postwar really absorbing in a way that those earlier books weren't. I gave up reading the other ones partly because I kept finding myself unconscious with boredom, face down in the gutter, but there are none of the standard problems here: Judt doesn't plod, he has a distinctive voice, and he doesn't just serve up one damn thing after another - we get a coherent narrative of the sociology and politics of pretty much everything west of the Urals (excepting Switzerland, which, for some reason, is more or less ignored - maybe it's because Judt's a Limey :-).    Anyway, my intuition is never to trust a really well written book: the better the book the more I feel I need to get a second opinion. Postwar drove me immediately to Hitchcock's The Struggle for Europe (which I found unreadable, alas, but that is another story).    Some more detail:    Judt is supposed to be a europhile, but there is no evidence of affection here - he has a coldly analytic eye. In the end he does make it clear that he prefers Europe, but he clearly doesn't particularly like Europe, or at least the sprayed up concrete, ethnically cleansed remnant that is all that's left of it (the guiding spirit for the project seems to be Raymond Aron).    The economics isn't on a par with the sociopolitics - you get the feeling that Judt is just regurgitating stuff he's read; for example, he makes a nice point about how radicals in Portugal didn't learn the lessons of the failure of similar southern attempts to implement land reform in the Italian north, but then misses the parallel point about how the German West failed - and are still failing - to learn the lesson about the East from the Italian North's years-long unfocussed subsidy of the South.    He doesn't like - and thus somehow doesn't get - the pop culture of the Seventies and the Eighties (he's clearly a Sgt. Peppers sort of guy), going so far as to grumpily imply that Sex Pistols are not as good as the Beatles.  Well yeah, but this is kind of missing the real (and more revealing) point, which is that the Sex Pistols aren't as good as the Monkees.    Finally, I really enjoyed the driveby on Susan Sontag (totally gratuitous, and the more entertaining for it).  Just about the only non-politico non-european in the book, she's shoved on camera and efficiently whacked even as she's still squinting into the Kliegs.  Takes barely a line - one blink and you'll miss it (though you can find it again easily, since it's in the - somewhat flakey - index: Suzie's there, but not, e.g., the Beatles).
B00005JOFQ|4.0|A good story and acting should define a movie, especially in the category of drama. Unfortunately, what ruled (and ruled out) this movie for many were labels attached to its release. The key was to look beyond those labels to be able to see a good movie.<br /><br />`Brokeback Mountain' is a very good movie when broken down to its talents:  story, script, directing, acting, cinematography and music.  I have almost no disagreement w/any of those subsets.<br /><br />In short - this is a story first and foremost about love. It's not a gay love story, but one of how love can go unfulfilled - and again, not with only the male leads in this movie. The fleshed-out script that was executed flawlessly.  Lee's directing was dead-on and the Oscar was well deserved.  As mentioned in numerous other reviews - the scenery, cinematography and music really set the stage for the overall look and feel of the movie.<br /><br />The reason the movie gets 4 stars for me was the acting.  Sure Gyllenhaal did a good job, but he didn't do a great job.  It was Ledger who shined.  I do think he was robbed of so many acting awards for this project.<br /><br />Ledger's character's pain at not being true to himself or the ones he loves (and I'm not just talking about `Jack') was palpable. His suppression of emotion is exactly what you'd expect from a character like that during a time/environment like that.  There were two scenes that got to me more than anything in the movies:  Ennis sobbing in an alley after coming off the mountain - and greeting Jack when he came for his first visit.  To me it was complete raw emotion and perfectly acted.<br /><br />I thought Williams did an excellent job in her role. It'd be nice to think she'll be known  more for this than something like `Dawson's Creek'.  Only Hathaway, playing Jack's wife, seemed miscast.  She wasn't as fluid an actress (or maybe it was the part) as the others. Trivial but everyone aged over those 20 years - and she looked like a 20 yo w/a succession of bad wigs. She was fine - just not to the caliber of the other actors.<br /><br />Do I think this is worth a purchase?  Yes.  I saw it in the theatre and purchased the DVD when it came out. If labels didn't apply - it'd be an instant classic0 yo w/a succession of bad wigs. She was fine - just not to the caliber of the other actors.  <br /> <br />Do I think this is worth a purchase?

Unplugged serait sans aucun doute le premier (voire unique) album en espagnol que je s?lectionnerais sans h?siter. C'est un ? classique ? pop/rock dont on ne se lasse pas et, si on parle un tant soit peu espagnol, on l'appr?cie d'autant plus. <br />Je ne suis pas une fan de musique pop en g?n?ral mais je peux reconna?tre un bon titre, une chanson parfaite. <br />L'album ouvre avec ? No para de llover ? - titre pop tr?s engageant - mais d'autres titres nous permettent aussi d'appr?cier la capacit? de Man? ? int?grer des rythmes mexicains, latins, plus traditionnels dans leur musique et, ce, de mani?re tout ? fait naturelle. Il n'y a en fait pas de mani?risme chez Man?, c'est simple, direct et impeccable. Les th?mes des chansons sont classiques (amours, rupture, relations, etc.) mais aussi sociaux comme dans ?

(mon titre pr?f?r?). <br />Je suis surprise de la comparaison entre Fher et Sting ; je pense sinc?rement que Fher et son groupe ont beaucoup plus de profondeur et de simplicit? que Monsieur Sting, qui ne m'impressionne que rarement. <br />Cependant la comparaison faite avec U2 peut se comprendre ; il y a dans la musique de Man? un caract?re ? universel ? - dans le message et la qualit? du rock - comme dans la musique de U2. Leur musique cependant refl?te beaucoup plus - et avec une certaine fiert? et tendresse qu'on se doit d'appr?cier- la culture d'origine du groupe, ce que U2 ne repr?sente plus vraiment, voire plus du tout (et c'est dommage).  <br />Si quelqu'un veut decouvrir Man?, je commencerais par cet album ; probablement l'essentiel.  <br />Y que lo disfrute mucho ! <br />
B000E97Y6K|3.0|My wife and I watched this beast of a movie over the course of two nights separated by about two weeks.  She asked me what I thought, and after I thought I came up with these points, both right and wrong.<br /><br />Right:<br /><br />1.  The beginning.  I really enjoyed hanging out in 1930's New York  and getting to know the characters.  \\"This is going to be a deep and thoughtful treatment of the King Kong story\\" I thought.  That lasted until the infamous dinosaur chase scene.  More on that later.<br /><br />2.  The ending.  I also thoroughly enjoyed Kong's final minutes climing up the Empire State building and his valiant but futile effort to fight off the fighter planes.<br /><br />Wrong:<br /><br />1.  The end of the beginning:  So, all of a sudden this movie that I'm really getting into becomes another stupid stunt-fest starting with a ridiculous and seemingly endless chase scene with humans running along with a stampede of dinosaurs.  Hey, those guys would have been dead in a few seconds.  Wouldn't it have been smarter to stand close to the canyon walls and let the dinos run by?  That's what I would have done.<br /><br />2.  Stunts, stunts, stunts.  Ann \\"Gumby\\" Darrow gets jerked around enough to put her in a whiplash collar for years but suffers no ill effects.  In fact, we know she doesn't die during the King Kong story so all this putting her in front of snapping T-Rex nasties is a total and laughable waste of time.<br /><br />3.  The beginning of the end:  So, Kong is finally overcome by chloroform and all of a sudden he's on Broadway!  How did they get him on the ship?  I really wanted to see that!<br /><br />4.  If only all that time has been spent on character development and deepening the story!  Or, spend more time on Ms. Darrow and Kong's relationship.  I didn't need to buy the two-disc special edition because I really don't care to watch all the features on disc two.  I really don't care to see it at all.<br /><br />So, this was a movie that was entertaining for both the right and wrong reasons.  I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.  At lease I can loan the DVDs to a friend or two and save them a rental fee.o, this was a movie that was entertaining for both the right and wrong reasons.  I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.

B000AMJDHY|1.0|What is it about this band that agitates me the most? Is it the bouncy, poppy, feather-light rhythms I have grown to loathe from the deepest depths of my soul? No. Is it the guitarist playing the same chord throughout the verses, giving the music a quality similar to the Chinese water torture? No. Is it the singer's abominably whiny voice making me wish I had a gun? Close, but no. What really gets under my skin is that this lighthearted, poppy, candyfloss garbage being the \\"next big thing\\" while here are brilliant, original, passionate, innovative rock bands out there like Opeth, Agalloch and Amon Amarth being completely ignored. If you enjoy passionate, soulful rock music, you have Amon Amarth. If you enjoy odd, quirky rock music you have System Of A Down. If you like happy, uplifting rock music you have Dragonforce. But there is nothing this excuse of a band have accomplished that hasn't been already done by the aforementioned bands uncountble times better. There is absolutely no merit in this pigswill.
B000001ELD|1.0|Are they kidding with this release? This is the 1978 solo record by the blood-spitting Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. Paul Stanley's solo lp is much better (see my review). I couldn't honestly see too many fans actually buying this CD reissue EXCEPT for maybe bored (yawn!) completists. I don't like to whine that much, but this disc was sort of tough for me to sit all the way through. There are a few so-so cuts, like \\"Burning Up With Fever\\", \\"See You Tonite\\" and possibly \\"Mr.Make Believe\\". But the album's closer \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" almost made my dinner come up. Simply avoid at ALL costs.

B00000IREA|4.0|I HAD to call my ex to ask her!<br /><br />The original version showed a lot more. More skin, more sex, more wild crazy sci fi. The screen was exploding with Jane's boobs. I thought there was more Anita too!<br /><br />This version is still good, but its a let down not to see the original. Its not a serious flick. Its not really artsy. Its a silly sci fi with a little skin and a lot of implied sex.<br /><br />I like to watch it and smile. :-)zu einem Friedensschluß zu kommen zwischen den Männern und ihr, zumal auch Malavoie seine persönlichen Dinge ( seine Frau hat ihn schändlich verlassen) von den beruflichen zu trennen gelernt hat.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Stop me if you've heard this one before: two gay cowboys and a sheep walk into a bar in Wyoming. The one cowboy asks the bartender, \\"say, do you serve sheep in this bar?\\" And the bartender says: \\"Naaahhh, pardner, but we do make some mean Buffalo Wings!\\"<br /><br />Ba-dump-bump.<br /><br />Anyway, Ang Lee bellies up to a different kind of bar with \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", a tale of the Love that Dare Not Speak its Name in 1963 Wyoming, where the men were---umm, well, fairly manly---and the sheep were pretty damned nervous.<br /><br />It's all about Jack and Ennis, two sheep-herds who venture out on the Lone Prair-EE and end up driving a lot more than a herd of sheep across the plains.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback\\" is just not all that: this movie is Lonnnnng. Dear Jesus, they don't even tell you it's nearly eight hours without a potty break, and yeah, it packs its tale of anguish, terror, and white-hot bull-riding over the course of 30 years or so, but in the end you'll feel like you've been hanging with these two Tumbling Tumbleweeds for a hundred years, old hoss.<br /><br />Now: it's amazing that Ang has been able to package up a sliver of Flyover America and make it palatable even---especially!---to the Upper East side Manhattanite's super-chic & utterly sensitive sensibilities: hey, who doesn't like a movie about gay cowboys! Hell, these are the kinds of Blue Staters *we* can dig---you could even, Hell, take these cowpokes---woops, sheep-pokes---to a Broadway show!<br /><br />But edgy and dark it's not. No, Love is not a \\"Force of Nature\\": it's the chemical and biological bilge that clouds the mind until the breeding is done, and then it's either race the pack of little vermin you spawned or pay child support until you're a poor old geezer eating catfood out of a tin.<br /><br />Or not: the real irony of \\"Brokeback\\", the real tragic cruelty, is that Jack and Ennis are doing nothing that hasn't been done throughout time, only Mother Nature has no use for them: they're not breeding, and so they've turned into an evolutionary Box Canyon, so to speak. Mother Nature is a real b*tch when it comes down to it: She turns her back on our boys, and the rest just plays out like a gunfight at the Not-O.K. Corral where everybody's packing black talon ammunition and the winner gets an acid bath.<br /><br />Dark and Edgy? Nah, it's just eyeball-rippingly slow and dull, a Lifetime movie with better cinematography.<br /><br />So what we're treated to during the 20 hours this movie takes to unwind is this: lots of strained, mooning looks and glances, a little splendor-in-the-tickle grass by the campfire, and about a century of agonizing over a little innocent putting-from-the-Rough. Sheesh.<br /><br />Acting? It's fine, if you think it's all that hard for two gay Hollywood actors who wear eyeliner and makeup for their roles to 'pretend' to be two gay Wyoming sheep-herders who wear eyeliner and maeup for their roles. Jake Gyllenhaal does his freakish thousand-yard-stare thing in this one, and does it well: he's definitely wearing the chaps in this relationship---by contrast, Heath Ledger is the Nancy, wearing that anxious \\"but will you respect me in the morning\\" look. The chicks (Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams) are just props.<br /><br />If Ang Lee had wanted \\"Brokeback\\" to be truly dangerous and edgy, he would have made a full-bore porn flick and let the MPAA slap the damned thing with an NC-17, and really pushed the sex in our faces: made it one sensuous, liquescent romp of riding and roping and driving those cattle across the plains! Don't gotta understand them, just drive and rope and brand them, Rawhide! Then he could have really marketed the WIDESCREEN version of the flick, for those looking for something really uncut, so to speak.<br /><br />Or at the least, he could have broken up the monotony with a raid by a war party of Apaches, or even had Jack do a little \\"Crouching Tiger\\" maneuver, chasing Ennis through the trees and prefacing their wild coupling with a little bamboo staff-fighting. That would have rocked, and I would have given this flick at least three stars.<br /><br />Alas, no dice: we just get a prettier version of \\"Bridges of Madison County\\", which Gylenhaal filling in for Clint and Heath wearing the prairie skirt. Our fathers got John Wayne battling Apaches and Commanches: our generation gets Heath and Jake bumping uglies on the Lone Prairie. Is it any wonder we're messed up?<br /><br />In the end, you'd be better off checking out \\"Open Range\\", which is basically the same story, only with a gunfight, a hanging, and a helluva lot more sublimation.<br /><br />JSGgh the trees and prefacing their wild coupling with a little bamboo staff-fighting.

B00005JOYA|1.0|MOVIE: Silent Hill is one of the greatest video games ever made. It utilizes atmosphere and sound to build suspense, and it also has some of the most grotesque and disturbing things you will ever see. The games are tense and incredibly entertaining to play. Konami did such a great job by using the environment as a supporting character. The movie does this. The movie looks exactly like the game, and it actually starts off rather promising. I gave this one a try since I love the games, and I think Cristophe Gans is a pretty good director. Let me tell you, the movie is absolute trash.  Even die-hard fans of the game will be asking themselves \\"what the frick is going on?\\". The plot makes no sense, the acting is downright awful, and the dialogue is just soooooooooooooo bad. The movie's plot has a mother and her daughter go to Silent Hill in hopes of figuring out her daughter's sleep walking and why she utters out \\"Silent Hill\\" as she talks in her sleep. What follows starts out intriguing but just ends up being absolute badness. At some points I actually dropped my head and shook it in shame. It's the most frustrating movie ever. You keep asking yourself \\"why would they do that, that doesn't make sense.\\" The only thing this movie has going for it is some excellent production design, decent visuals, and good cinematography. However, the script is a total mess, the characters are hollow and empty, and it's not the least bit scary. Not one thing about this movie was scary. At some points they start to build tension, but it never peaks. Nothing makes you coil up in anticipation like the game does. The game got under your skin, at points when I was playing the games I would be like \\"oh god, I don't wanna open that door, I don't wanna see what's behind it.\\" With the movie, they never achieve that sense of tension. I mean, I was utterly speachless at times, at a loss for words as I tried to comprehend the reasoning for some of the choices the filmmakers went with. The film just unravels into a steaming pile of poo. I mean, how? . . . why? . . . it's just . . . arrrrg, I'm so frustrated. I am at a loss of hope for the horror genre.  Never will we see a great horror film again like The Shining or The Excorcist, never. We will never see a great video game adaptation either, I mean, they just keep ruining them.  How did this happen. They had such a great thing to work with, they had the opportunity to make a very atmospheric horror movie, and they just said \\"ah, to hell with it, let's just add crazy loonies and confuse the audience.\\"<br /><br />ACTING: No. Yuck. I don't want to talk about it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Don't see it, especially if you're a fan. It will ruin Silent Hill for you.  Now I will never be able to play the game again without thinking about this ludicrous movie. The only explanation I can come up with is that Uwe Boll had a little chat with Cristophe right before production started.unravels into a steaming pile of poo.

B000CNFC76|4.0|MOVIE: Bill Paxton makes his sophomore feature directing attempt, and this time he does a complete switch of genre. His last film, Frailty, was a suspense film and now he is behind the wheel of a Disney film. I have to admit I went into this one with low expectations. I expected the typical run of the mill overcoming adversity story. Also, it's a movie about golf. The story is about Francis Ouimet, the youngest person to ever win the US Open. The film is not bad at all, and is actually an intriguing watch. Marc Foster wrote the screenplay based on his own book. Paxton's attention to detail really sells this as a period piece. It takes place during the early 1900's, and the audience feels like it's the early 1900's. The costume and production designs were very good. Paxton also does a fine job of directing even though some of the golfing sequences feel too out of place. I know they were trying to find different film techniques to make golf entertaining to watch, and even though they felt out of place they worked. The slow motion sequences in the rain are particularly noteworthy. Overall, this is a great film that anybody can enjoy. Just because it's PG and it's a Disney film doesn't mean it's aimed for the kiddies. In fact the young ones may get bored with this movie and not even understand some of it. The film has a running social commentary on the class systems. Francis starts as a caddy, a lower class citizen who defies customs and plays among the upper class. This class struggle helps to round the characters out and make them more dynamic, which in turn makes the film a compelling watch.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting in the film was also quite good. Shia LaBeouf stars as Francis and does a great job with the role. I didn't like him in I, Robot or Constantine, but I have to admit after seeing him in this role he looks to be a prominent star on the rise. The rest of the cast does an admirable job in the supporting roles and their performances help sell the golf scenes and make them entertaining to watch.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: What may look like another sports themed Disney film is actually a great and inspiring story about class struggle and the making of a new champion. Great performances and a great story make the film worth the time.cenes and make them entertaining to watch. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: What may look like another sports themed Disney film is actually a great and inspiring story about class struggle and the making of a new champion.

This may be my favorite Sonic Youth disc, though I'm sure next week it'll be EVOL, follwed by another...They are all great!!<br /><br />Buy the remaster, you won't regret it!
B00005JOYA|5.0|For a truly unique film experience check out \\"Silent Hill\\".  As a fan of the games I expected to be impressed but anyone looking for innovative filmmaking and extraordinary (WOW) production design should find this film fascinating.  I am firmly convinced that Gans and Avery have hit a home run here.    For those who have never seen the game, \\"Silent Hill\\" is the best ever survival/ horror game series.  It is difficult and confusing (a lot of mazes and D&D-like details) so expect major disorientation at times during the film-which is a bit like actually playing the game.       The acting was convincing, the editing extraordinary, and the atmosphere oppressive.   Not 100% how I visualized it before viewing but even the differences tended to work in favor of the film.     The town itself looked and actually felt familiar, unlike the mess they made of \\"House of Wax\\".  This is definitely the sort of film best seen on the big screen with a theater sound system.   Everyone should be totally creeped out.    Enough said, more at this stage might spoil things so read on only if you have already seen the film or if you don't mind some spoilers.      Dahlia Gillespie had a daughter (by an unknown father) named Alessa. Alessa became the town outcast until a bunch of religious nuts (led by Christabella) decided she was a witch and must be sacrificed to keep evil out of Silent Hill.  Dahlia went along with this because she was afraid of her own damnation for having the child.  But the ceremony went wrong and the nutcases were not just killed but sent to a netherworld between heaven and hell.     The dark side of Alessa ended up in the same place but she was split into duel entities and the good part stayed in the normal world where she was adopted by Rose and Chris, and named Sharon.   Sharon's sleepwalking is caused by her connection with Alessa who wants her to return to Silent Hill.      On the way to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon arouse the suspicions of a motorcycle policewoman (Cybil Bennett).  This happens because Cybil has been extremely protective of children since she saved a little boy from a psychopath.  Cybil follows them to Silent Hill (once a coal mining town that was abandoned because of a burning seam of coal under the town).   At the town limits a mysterious girl appears and both vehicles crash.  When Rose and Cybil regain consciousness Sharon is gone.    As they explore the abandoned buildings they discover a church with a warning siren where the religious cult hides when Alessa (presumably) causes a darkness to take over the town; for some reason the darkness and Alessa cannot enter the church.  It turns out that Alessa sent her Sharon identity back into the world of the living to bring back someone (Rose) who can take her into the church where she can finally exact her revenge.    Everyone is dead in the netherworld of Silent Hill, even Rose and Cybil-they don't know it yet but they died in the accident-because you can only  enter the town if you are dead.   Alessa needs Rose which is why she died, it was just Cybil's bad luck to have been involved in the accident.     The tip off to their being parallel towns comes when Rose's husband Chris enters the real Silent Hill and finds nothing supernatural in the place; although he senses a connection with his wife and adopted daughter, he finds no tangible sign of them.   Rose passes right through him and the ending scene of Rose and Sharon in their home is blurred, but the scene with Chris in the parallel home is completely clear.    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B00005JOE8|4.0|I never read the graphic novel that the film \\"V for Vendetta\\" was based in. I heard about the comparisons to the current political climate but I went into this film as that it was merely entertainment. I did not go in with any pre-conceived notions or political agenda.<br /><br />After the artistically disasterous Matrix trilogy (sorry, all three films were three too many), the Wachowski brothers return to the big screen with a vengenece with the explosive \\"V for Vendetta\\". The setting takes place in the future where the United States is no longer the lone superpower on the planet and is in a complete disarray. Britain has now taken over the US's role. Along the way John Hurt's character Adam Sutler has risen to power and became a totalitarian dictator. Hugo Weaving plays a mysterious figure named V who hides behind a mask. His intentions are to bring down Adam Sutler and his cronies. Natalie Portman is Evey, a young woman who accidently gets caught up in V's escapades when V rescues her from some strangers who tries to attack her.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film a bit. The action sequences and the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved listening to Hugo Weaving speak through the mask so eloquently. It was quite a departure from his villainous role in the Matrix series. I loved the diversity in the music which ranged from orchestral to modern day indie pop (Cat Power). The film isn't completely perfect. I thought some scenes tended to drag on longer than they should have been but overall I enjoyed \\"V for Vendetta\\" as a whole.
B00005KB9R|5.0|I find it fascinating how everyone seems to forget that the band is The Wailers (AS IT IS ON THE COVER) and not just a solo endeavor. Incredible album by THE WAILERS! One reviewer even states it as \\"HIS ultimate work\\"! This was the last time The Wailers were just that before corporate recording companies decided to put Bob Marley out in front.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Oh boy was I excited to get the unrated version on DVD as I missed it at the show. In short, this movie sucks - it sucks bad. <br /> <br />1) After the first 10 minutes, I wanted to rip it out of the player, snap it in half, and dispose of it properly - rid the world of this trash. Why? The scenes of Amsterdam (was it even filmed there??) If you've ever been there, this film will piss you off with its childish, inaccurate portrayal. <br /> <br />2) Was this supposed to be a comedy? I'm not sure. It's that dumb. <br /> <br />3) The torture is way over-rated. Check out Audition instead. <br /> <br />4) Only near the end do we get the story.  <br /> <br />Is it a fantastic concept? Yes it is.  <br /> <br />Could it have been one of the truly great cult movies of all time? Oh yeh - definitely.  <br /> <br />Did Roth even come close to pulling it off? Hell no. <br /> <br />Overall, Cabin Fever is a masterpiece next to this garbage. Even the gore is weak - has a video game feel to it. And the eyeball gag? Oh gee, I think this has been done a few times through the years in horror cinema.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for good dialogue - there's one good scene about 2 minutes long.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for gore - go elsewhere. <br /> <br />If you're looking for suspense - keep looking; I mean who cares about these people anyway - I know I didn't. Character development is close to non-existent in this film. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this is a good start for an emerging (or unused in a while) genre. Taking this exact storyline, I'd like to see someone other than Roth try a remake. It could go down in history as one of the great cult films. As it stands, it's near worthless, and totally laughable.
B00005JOE8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. I thought it was well directed, well acted, and well written. I thought it had a really interesting story and great action scenes. So far this is one of the year's best movies.
0743454537|5.0|I know the Year just started, but this has to be the best book I have ever read. I couldn't put this book down!! I have to admit I would have never picked this book up, but my sister (who never reads) gave it to me to read, after her roomate told her to read it. So needless to say if my sister read a book, and liked it, it must be good.  <br /> <br />The whole plot is amazing, and even though Cancer is what is supposebly breaking up the family. I could relate to all the issues, from not being a close family anymore, to mothers choosing to be at the side of one sibling and ignorning the rest.... Im not gonna give away any more, but if your a family person, this is a must read. You'll enjoy every bit of this book, while it has its seriousness, there is humor thrown in there also. I have told all my friends to read this book, and not one has said that they don't like it.
B00005JOYA|2.0|The movie starts out pretty good, and I must say that the music and the visuals are incredible in this movie. However, WHY did they change the cult mythology that was essential to the silent hill game? Instead of a pseudo-satanic cult trying to give life to a demon, the movie has a wacked out fundamentalist christian cult that wanted to cleanse evil. That made NO sense, and it really detracted from what would otherwise have been an acceptable adaptation of a frightening video game.
B00004XONN|4.0|I might as well throw my 2 cents into the pile: <br /> <br /> <br />I heard \\"National Anthem\\" when I didn't know who the hell Radiohead was. I had heard \\"Creep\\" but couldn't name the band. I loved this song; it was fun to listen to, and it wasn't like everything else I had heard. <br /> <br />I listened to the rest of this album and I enjoyed it. I liked its changes and varieties and weird noisy moments, for the most part.  <br /> <br />I picked up O.K Computer and The Bends and I prefer them over Kid A, but I still contend that \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" is one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard. Moments of beauty in chaos characterize this album, and the chaos manages to be beautiful, too. <br /> <br />Experiments can be repeated, and built upon. Compared to really out-there noise music (Steve Reich anyone?), this album is pretty much within the bounds of convention.   <br />People who are only interested in 2 guitars, a bass and drums, with solid catchy melodies to hold on to- steer clear of Kid A. Hell, listen to The Bends.  <br /> <br />But dismissing this album as pretentious noise with a cursory listen is childish. Kid A offers genuine musical goodness with a side of noise.  <br /> <br />P.S. If the processing puts you off, listen to \\"Idioteque\\" and \\"Everything in its Right Place\\" live on I Might Be Wrong. They gave me goosebumps the first time I heard them.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|I thought that this movie was very entertaining.  I don't think that it was scary though. There are just a couple of torture scenes. But, don't let this be the reason to not watch the movie.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good movie, and a good story. It is a good story because it is realistic - a couple of college boys going off to Europe to have fun, end up in a weird town, meet up with some cute girls, and become the unwilling victims in a scheme where weirdos pay big bucks to torture and kill other people. <br /> <br />Also, I think that anyone who watches this movie will be very satisfied with the ending, because what comes around, goes around.  <br /> <br />You will definitely root for the hero in this movie when you see him handing out justice left and right.t geschaffen wird, der nicht mehr zu verwalten ist.

The only difference is he changed the key. I purchased this album strictly because I am a Floyd fan and collect every members solo albums and such.  <br /> <br />Like I said, this album is decent but not as good as some of these reviews.

B00005JOYA|4.0|I went to see Silent Hill opening night and had high expectations for it. With that being said, it did not disappoint but did not completely fulfill my taste for a Silent Hill movie adaptation. The visuals were second to none, but the plot just didn't feel like  it was Silent Hill. I hate that they made the demon a victim of a stupid witch burning cult. From what I remember in the games there was a cult who worshiped some sort of demon god and he was unpleasant just because. We, as moviegoers and gamers alike, want to see basically the same story plot and visuals. Visuals did surpass my expectations. The town of Silent Hill was wonderfully captured as well as the monsters too. But plot is a crucial element in any movie whether it is a video game adaptation or not. Didn't find it as frightening as the Silent Hill games as well. This movie had to be pretty incomprehensible to people who had not played the games. Visuals earn Silent Hill 4 stars alone. If the visuals weren't up to par I would have given this movie 0 stars. Filmakers need to learn to find that us fans are real nitpickers especially when you are charging us 10-12 dollars a movie to see,and ends up not satisfying fully. Somebody try again at adapting a Silent Hill movie and this time make it have a plot worthy of the name Silent Hill. Thank you.
B00005JOYA|3.0|All the reviews of this movie have either been positive or negative. People seem to either love this movie or hate this movie; I for one am in the middle but leaning more (much more) towards like. Of course going into the movie with the information I had on it is also influencing my review.    Rose cannot accept the knowledge that her daughter Sharon is dying of a fatal disease. Over the protests of her husband, she flees with her child, intending to take the girl to a faith healer. On the way, she ends up driving through a portal in reality, which takes her to the eerie and deserted town of Silent Hill. Sharon disappears in Silent Hill, and Rose follows what she thinks is her daughter's silhouette all over town. It's soon clear the town is not like any place she's ever been. It's inhabited by a variety of creatures and a living darkness that descends and literally transforms everything it touches. The human inhabitants - the ones who are left - are trapped and fighting a losing battle against the Darkness. Joined by a cop named Cybil, who has been sent to bring her and Sharon back, Rose searches for her little girl while learning the history of Silent Hill and that Sharon is just a pawn in a larger game...    That's the premise of Christophe Gans' game to movie adaptation. I went in to this movie knowing the premise. I've never played any of the games in this series but I really want to. Gans' did a terrific directing job. The sets look amazing. Everything is beautifully shot and he uses some camera angles which I am going to assume resemble the games' angles in some parts. All in all, his directing job is very well done; you can tell he loves this series.    The script for this movie has been under a lot of scrutiny. Ok, it's not perfect and yes, it does have some corny, cheesy and out of place dialogue but I looked past that. I could have used without Rose yelling \\"Sharon!\\" over and over and over and over again. I was expecting Ozzy Osbourne to pop up and share in the yelling.    The acting is what you'd expect in this kind of movie. Who's here is solid, not the best but they get the job done. Mitchell does a great job as Rose while Sean Bean is just there. Jodelle Ferland is good as the child as well. The score is just ho-hum. It's not bad but it's nothing memorable. They use the \\"Silent Hill Theme\\" too much (don't know if that's the games' theme they're using or the movie's theme).    The effects in this are top notch. The monsters are inventive and creepy. They're unlike anything I've seen. It also helps they're not all CGI. They're people underneath there and there's very little CGI used.    Ok, now to the information on why I rated this a little higher than I normally would have. This movie's run time is 125 minutes (approx.). Things seem missing at some places and not everything makes sense at the end. That's because the original cut was longer than King Kong, it was 3 and a half hours! So yeah, lots of things were cut, I guess that's why I'm being lenient to it and not bashing it. I went in expecting that and wasn't disappointed. This gets a higher grade because I understood things got cut out. The movie entertained me anyways. So I wasn't fully aware of what was going on in some places but I was so wrapped up in the world I was drawn into that I really didn't care. That's kind of like Doom, it's an empty empty movie but it's fun. Silent Hill is a movie with a simple plot and things were cut out but it was fun. Was Doom a \\"good\\" movie? No. Was it a \\"fun\\" movie? Yes and that's all that matters for a flick like this. I didn't go into this movie expecting gold in the first place and I wasn't let down. I guess the biggest thing that irked me was the ending. I heard about this huge amazing ending that left the movie wide open for a sequel. Sorry, it didn't. Sure, the ending was damn cool but wasn't what I was expecting, which is my fault and not the movie's. I enjoyed the very ending cause we don't get full closure. The ending is enigmatic but it doesn't hurt the film. My other large complaint is that the Sean Bean character really serves no purpose. His scenes only detract us from Rose's situation, a world that we've become a part of and entwined in.    So no, this isn't a perfect movie, not many are. And yes, things were cut out and that will cause people to be lost. Is this the definitive videogame movie? Far from it. But I went in knowing this wasn't Gans' true vision, just his best effort to put out what he was allowed and for that I congratulate him. He created a pretty alright videogame movie. I'm hoping his cut is a great one. The dialogue will make you laugh and the acting isn't the greatest but it's supposed to be a fun ride and I for one am glad I took that ride.     NOTE: I actually give this movie a 3.5 but seeing as how I can't give it that on the star line...you know.
0553212621|4.0|A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the \\"sturdy\\" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands.  Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent.  A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.<br /><br />The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her.  In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of \\"his\\" child.  He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist.  Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper.  Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically.  The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her.  To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life.  Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government.  Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.<br /><br />Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living.  The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader.  Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to  outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity. n Mary Whipplefe, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.

B000071IYQ|1.0|I bought this new at a Borders about 4 years ago and paid about $60.  If you pay $150, you're getting ripped off.  It's a great set, but not at this price.
B000BJS4OY|3.0|First, let me state that I'm not that big a Springsteen fan, and that I bought the collection for my wife. The added material in the package is great and lends tons of information to the casual fan. But after listening to all the hard work that went into the album on the \\"making of\\" DVD, I was HIGHLY disappointed in the remastering job. Extremely flat and lifeless. I understand that we're talking about an old recording, but give me a break! Listen to \\"Lazy\\" on the 25th aniversary Deep Purple \\"Machine Head\\" CD if you want to hear excellent remastering. Or the Beatles \\"One\\" CD. I could go on with tons more examples. I wanted to be blown away by the disc, but can't say I have been. Great for people who have to have everything, but don't buy it for the remaster.
B00005JOE8|5.0|I have to say this: I don't get emotional and I don't really care for the movies I watch today. My list of favorite movies has only 2 items. So when I say V For Vendetta is the best movie I have ever watched, I mean it. I watch it for the first time a week ago, and since then I watched 2 more times, and I admit it, I'm going to see it again tomorrow. Every time I walk out of the cinema I'm smiling and my energy is at its full.<br /><br />  Fascism, totalitarian government, dictatorship, terrorism and most important, anarchism. Those are the things that make this movie real. And that's why I sob whenever I see that ending. Evey's last words in the movie, that music, that image...that's the most beautiful movie scene I have ever seen.<br /><br />  V is a truly charming character. I fell in love with this movie and with him. His idea, his purpose, although not clear in the movie, is extremely inspiring, and it made me spend almost all of my free time reading, learning and understanding anarchism and all its forms. The whole movie is thrilling to me, it's filled with amazing lines and points of view, but nothing compares to the final scene. No matter how many times I watch it, it always gets to me and makes me cry like a baby. It's the most bittersweet thing I have ever felt. It's the high point of a passion that started a long time ago and that is not shared by only one person, it is every person's dream.<br /><br />  One last thing: the sound track couldn't be any more perfect and suitable.And some people might say it's boring because it deals with politics and we are tired of it. But the difference is that in this film there's change. There's hope. There's dream. And for me, that's what is really entertaining.
B00005LW7R|2.0|This one doesn't compare to Giulini's landmark recording or Karajan's...Terfel is terrific and the rest of the cast simply cannot compete...Hampson bellows and bawls his way as usual...he is no match for the memory of Warren, Merrill or Nucci...save your $$$
0688170528|5.0|Like others, I found this book one of those books you cannot put down. The flashbacks made the book entertaining, as if the plot itself was not entertaining enough.  <br /> <br />Since I found myself loving this book so much, I could not help but get a tiny bit defensive over the comments. It irked me immensely to read that people didn't 'know' the characters enough. <br /> <br />The characters were obviously not directly characterized through this novel. Indirectly, the characters were displayed through the flashbacks, dialogue, and action. Heck, during one part of the novel, the mom goes through her diary. I think the best part of a novel is reading it and based on inferences and thinking, making conclusions on the characters. Thats what make a novel better than most. Thats what makes a novel great. <br /> <br />Moreso, I felt that Picoult portrayed a much more intimate relationship than a high school love. I find it impossible for some people not to be able to see that. They grew up together and I felt they were truly each other. Even if one party did not love the other like they did, it was still a very intimate relationship, showing more intimacy than the common friendship, even between most high school 'best friends'. <br /> <br />The reason, I believe, this novel is so amazing, is because it makes you think. The controversial subject with characters you would never expect in that sort of situation made an impact on me. One of the hardest concepts an author needs to master is the art of influencing people and making a statement, which in my opinion, is what a novel is all about. A novel is the art of expressing the authors opinion or view on something through fiction. I truly think Picoult mastered that concept, and not only that, she displayed this skill with knowledge and sophistication.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|The movie world is full of countless flicks that will make you jump, scream and maybe hurl your popcorn across the cinema. Boogeymen creep from closets. Lunatics are killed but keep getting up. Tiny dolls with knives menace entire communties. Most people enjoy a harmless fright. It's all good once the credits roll and the theater is lighted again.<br /><br />Hostel is not a harmless fright. It's bleak, bloody and bold and suited only for those who like to wander to the really dark places. It's a gloomy, hard tale every bit as traumatizing to the intellect as it is repulsive to the eye.<br /><br />In short, I freaking love this movie. And it all starts with lively music and naked people. For the first 45 minutes, I wanted to be a reckless teen again. I wanted to get myself a passport and backpack and prepare to tramp all over Europe. I wanted to wander with my friends and experience the liberal offerings of those far flung countries. I wanted to indulge in all the vice so vividly advertised in the opening scenes of the movie.<br /><br />By the time it was done, I had endeavored never to leave the safety of the United States. Nossir. I'll burn the passport, drop the backpack in a river and stay right here where 911 is always a finger's length away.<br />Much fuss is made about the graphic violence in \\"Hostel.\\" It's certainly graphic and violent as they come. Yet, it's not the blood and gore, drills and saws that will leave you unsettled. More disturbing is the concept at the very heart of the tale. The idea that Americans abroad could be snared into a sinister underworld and then sold to wealthy sadists to do with as they will. What gnaws at you is how handily such a business could operate.<br />There's a scene midway through the film where a young man awakes with a hood over his face and only a small hole to see through. His feet are bound to the floor. His hands are bound behind him. He is a prisoner in a dark, dingy roomand the horrible truth of his situation becomes abundantly clear soon enough.<br />The movie works because it plants you in that very chair. You feel the rising desperation as it becomes evident what your role is here. You are a plaything for a madman who has paid good money to satisfy all the depraved longings in his sick heart. At his disposal is a nauseating variety of tools. There are drills and blades, saws and hammers, needles and scalpels. All the things that have scared you since your first visit to the dentist or doctor are right here and there will be no anesthesia.<br />Yeah, it's pretty damn jolting when the first young man gets a drill bit sunk into his thigh. But more revolting is the notion that this is the only beginning. Because a person who pays enormously for such nasty pleasure is surely not going to be quick about it. You feel the grinding and growing horror of the victim's plight. Screaming will get them nowhere. This is a place designed specifically for screams. There will be no human rights groups stopping by. There will be no U.S. led rescue operation at the last minute. This is a place with a name like Ardvarkia, or Ohyuckia. The safety of home is a long ways off and the people back there are blissfully unaware of this strange country and of the terrors therein.<br />Sure, in-your-face images of dismember legs and hanging eyeballs will ruin your popcorn. But it's the heavy feeling of isolation and helplessness that will cloud the rest of your day.<br />There are plenty of people who refuse to see this flick. If they are timid about unrestrained nastiness, I don't blame them. Don't blame them at all. But if you're even mildly curious about the movie, I say go. Go spend a couple hours with Tarantio and Eli Roth, and you'll feel a little better about missing those overseas trips when you were a cocky college kid. You never go the high times in Barcelona, it's true. But at least you have all your fingers and you never had an eyeball dangling against your cheek.<br /><br />If you still geta giddy delight watching the ear scene in \\"Reservoir Dog,\\" go see this movie. Just cut your date some slack if he or she starts squeezing your hand with bone crushing might. It's only human to recoil against atrocities committed against humans. And a story that can reach a person on that primitive level is a success. I give \\"Hostel\\" two thumbs up to go with the three or four laying on the floor.ir Dog,\\" go see this movie.

B00011CZRE|5.0|\\"Seven\\" is one of those movies I enjoyed thoroughly from start to finish. And yet I wandered around in gloom the rest of the day.<br /><br />This is a movie filled with vivid death and mounting mystery. The premise is brilliant and the acting superb. A twisted killer is afoot and he is slicing, dicing, overfeeding, and generally having a great old time offing people in accordance with the seven deadly sins. The victims become stark symbols of man's greed, lust, envy, gluttony and so on. It's a brilliant mind that conceives of such a blueprint of death, and it's that brilliant mind that makes him so difficult to catch. Unless, of course, he wants to be caught.<br /><br />The movie is gory and violent and those things are wonderful for your film going experience. What gets you is the low lighing, the constant rain, the dolorous music. David Fincher wants you to feel gloomy and he achieves this. Throw in a nasty, jarring ending and you'll wander away from this movie feeling like somebody tortured and killed your dog.<br /><br />I mean that in a good way. A must see movie.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|On the above it was only because i lost discs and just wasent interested at the time FF8 in my opinion is one of the best games of all time, not just RPG of all time. Anyone know if they have any movies based on FF8 or FFX if they so forgive my ignorance. Now on to what youve been waiting for the review after sitting at my friends uncomfortable chair watching the japanese version he had downloaded onto his computer, for like a week all i was talking about was how cool Advent Children was. downloading pictures to my PC getting ticked off when my friend burnt it and it dident turn out right, and when i ordered the japanese version last year off ebay and got ripped off. I have preordered it and hopefully the english version will not take away from the brillance i saw displayed in the japanese version. My comments on this movie will indeed be short and people are bound to disagree after watching it i said it was \\"the best movie ever made, GOD in cinematic form\\" Until i see otherwise this is going to be one movie i am proud of owning for a long time to come. Hint long time is forever. My limited intelligance can not accuretly detail all the emotions i felt watching it, it tugged at my heart strings and god forbid anyone give this movie i bad review again amen.nauigkeit - überraschend gut für eine funkmaus. vergleichbar mit meiner bisherigen (kabel)maus. zum spielen zwischendurch sehrwohl geeignet- schnelle fps shooter aber nur bedingt- kabel wegen dem \\"stromspar lag\\" zb: den hat sie nach 10 unbewegten sek. sie muss erst wieder \\"anspringen\\" weil sie in diesem modus sehr kleine bewegungen ignoriert. im klartext: lässt man sie ein wenig stehn und bewegt sie dann wieder, \\"klebt\\" der cursor noch ca 1/10sek fest. ein pro-gamer nimmt eine kabellose wie die sicher nicht zum zocken- ich denke aber dass dieser trotzdem jeden \\"nicht pro\\" in grund und boden stampfen kann, auch wenn er die mx610 dabei verwendet und der 08/15 zocker eine razer bzw G5 ;) <br />ein freund von mir hat die ältere mx700 (auch kabellos) und jetzt auch die mx610- er findet die 610er bei weitem präziser. ich habe den usb-transceiver am usb hub 10cm neben der maus- je näher desto besser! <br /> <br />batterielaufzeit- angeblich sehr lange, konnte ich aber noch nicht bestätigen. sie fährt gekoppelt mit dem pc herunter bzw auf standby. einleuchtend, dass das batterienschonender ist. <br /> <br />kompatibilät bzw \\"blinkende-tasten-funktion\\" - etwas enttäuschend, da die email-taste mit dem aktuellen treiber nur mit outlook kompatibel ist und die messenger-taste nur mit icq (und msn messenger glaub ich auch- bin mir nicht mehr sicher). <br />alles andere geht nicht- wie zb der gaim messenger- oder das emailprogramm vom mozilla. bessere unterstützung von alternativen applikationen dieser art wünsche ich mir. ein traum wäre, wenn das blink feature mehr od weniger frei konfigurierbar  wäre (die mx610 ist die erste maus die nicht nur daten an den pc sendet sondern auch information erhalten und verarbeiten kann mittels mikrocontroller). ach ja: die \\"vor/zurück\\" funktion der daumentasten geht im iexplore wie erwartet- im firefox aber nicht(!) meine alte intelli explorer konnte das- also, wenn das nicht lächerlich ist...! man kann zwar die daumenbuttons mit den keyoard hotkeys vom FF belegen- aber so verliert man die standard vor/zurück funktion. (falls das eine marketing strategie von logi+m$ sein sollte, dann ists eine unverschämte frechheit) <br /> <br />fazit: <br />eine wahre handschmeichlerin- etwas pummelig vielleicht, aber super verarbeitung und sooo schön :) für den office alltag tadellose präzision, allein die treiberunterstützung (vor allem) der blinktasten ist ein definitives manko, wenn man nicht die standard applikationen verwenden möchte. logitech sollte schleunigst die treibersoftware updaten. <br /> <br />ich habe den kauf der mx610 nicht bereut- eine top maus :) <br /> <br />1 stern abzug allerdings wegen der suboptimalen treibersoftware
B000EGCITG|5.0|I'm a 39 year old stay at home Mom of two who grew up first with the music of my parents generation from the 60's and 70's and then with the Music of the 80's.  Over the last decade, its been honestly hard to say that there has been any music that I have considered worth listening to and playing.  Not the case with Pink.  I had a friend send me a link with the song \\"Dear Mr. President..\\" that after listening to it had me near tears because it was as if she and the Indigo Girls took all the feelings and thoughts in my mind and heart about what the Bush Administration is doing and put it into a song.  Lines in the song like \\"How could a father hate his own daughter if she were gay?\\" or \\"Wanna talk about hard work? How about minimum wage and a baby on the way!  You don't know about hard work!\\"  or \\"How do you sleep at night when the rest of the world cries?\\".  It's powerful stuff combined with her fantastic voice and beautiful guitar music, as well as the talent of the Indigo Girls. <br /> <br />I then got the CD and listened to all the rest of the songs and they are all wonderful, each different and addressing different topics, some serious, others not so.  This woman is seriously talented and an artist that I think will evolve and grow as she matures.  No Britney here.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|The movie is perfectly casted and acted, and the butler was simply a hoot!

That is beyond selfish and cruel, but that is blithely ignored by the offending parties during the course of the action.<br /><br />And, come ON!! Who in their right mind would ever leave - sigh - Dennis Quaid????
B000001ESN|5.0|It seems as though Rush has lived through three incarnations.  The first began with the band's self-titled debut and ended with HEMISPHERES in 1978; this was the band's traditional hard-rock period.  The second began with the release of PERMANENT WAVES in 1980.  During this phase, Rush began experimenting more with synthesizers and created a sound that was more \\"new wave\\" than \\"hard rock\\".  That said, PERMANENT WAVES is a magnificent album, ranking beside MOVING PICTURES as the band's finest achievement.  It opens with the affectionate \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", followed by the high-powered anthem \\"Freewill\\".  Alex Lifeson's guitar work meshes with Geddy Lee's synthesizers to create an apocalyptic, stormy atmosphere on \\"Jacob's Ladder\\".  \\"Entre Nous\\" is the band's (successful) attempt at making an intelligent love song.  The calm \\"Different Strings\\" was the final Rush song with lyrics written by someone other than Neil Peart (in this case, it's Geddy Lee).  Finally, the album closes with the nine-minute \\"Natural Science\\", which features those wonderfully intellectual and analytical lyrics which Peart is so skilled at writing.  With PERMANENT WAVES, Rush burst into the experimental 80's, showcasing a new sound and attracting more attention than ever before.  It seems impossible that the band would reach higher heights than this - yet on their subsequent release, MOVING PICTURES, Rush did just that.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The riffs will remind you of the brash drumming of Led Zeppelin, combined with the latin rock quirkiness of Santana.  Weave in some murky Tangerine Dream and Skinny Puppy soundscapes and lilting vocals, reminiscent of Freddy Mercury (but still having the Robert Plant creepiness).  This layered and frenetic combination has put many of my friends off when they listen to it, but I'm hooked.  This will wake you up like coffee in the morning!    The stream of conscious style lyrics are a playground of images, AND it's a concept album with a booklet available online.    What more could you want?!  This band is the last refuge for rock fans.  Hopefully you enjoy jam sessions!
B000001ESF|5.0|Rush finally hit it big with their fourth album, 2112 (spoken \\"Twenty-One Twelve\\").  Despite popular belief, 2112 is not a concept album.  It is divided into two halves.  The first half consists of only one song: the epic title track, a dark sci-fi tale of a future where the government controls what we see and hear.  The second half of the album consists of five stand-alone songs, the best of which are \\"A Passange to Bangkok\\", the detached \\"Twilight Zone\\", and the sorrowful \\"Tears\\".  2112 has a little less of the high-powered prog rock one expects on a Rush album and a little more of dreamy songs filled with longing or sorrow.  That's not bad; it's one of the things which makes the album unique.  2112 is considered by most fans to be the band's first truly classic release; to this day, it ranks among the best rock albums of the decade and the very best of Rush.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|There's not much point defining The Mars Volta, but their style includes punk, latin-jazz improv, electronica with a taste of metal art rock.    It was hard for me to choose a favorite between De-loused in the Comatoriam and Frances the Mute, but eventually I landed on Frances the Mute because it seems to have been effortless for them to produce this gem.  It has latin jazz influences (and who doesn't feel latin jazz?) and long rock improvs that will haunt you like a great Led Zeppelin song.  How can these divergent styles possibly create something good?  I don't know how, but it works.  Zeppelin meets Santana meets Pink Floyd, but it still sounds modern.   Some cool summer evening, when the night sounds start to fill the air, try listening to track 8, \\"Cassandra Geminni / Tarantism\\" and see if you don't feel as if the world just drops away, abandoning you to the stars.
0722535201|5.0|I have read many of Paulo Coelho's books during the last year, and I am constantly amazed by how he's able to thread amazing spiritual lessons within fictional works - and all of them page-turners at that!<br /><br />\\"By the River Piedra...\\" is about love - the love of a man & a woman, and the love of each of them for God.  It also explores the feminine aspect of God - describing God as having both male & female \\"attributes\\" (for lack of a better word), as well as the idea that we all have the ability to perform miracles - in our own lives, and in the lives of others.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a beautifully written spiritual book - one that lends itself to reflection.  If you are at all interested in fictional books with a spiritual lesson, I would highly recommend not only this book, but all of this author's books - they all have something wonderful to offer!
B000000WFZ|5.0|This is a truly fantastic soundtrack.  <br /> <br />My personal favourite song is a small, overlooked gem, a short piece called \\"Brothers\\". A simple tune, flute and guitar. So clean, so soul-touching. It belongs to a relatively inconsequential scene of the movie, when Rodrigo is training his brother Felipe on his horseriding skills. It is a song that exudes tranquility, transmits the joy of living. In less than a minute and a half (even shorter in the movie). <br /> <br />I could listen to it all day long. It's not one of the \\"great\\" tunes in the movie (no big orchestra, no choir, no weight, no top scene to go with it), but if I had to keep only one song from this soundtrack, \\"Brothers\\" would be mine.  <br /> <br />One of the nicest songs I have ever heard, a masterpiece. To me, the CD would be worth it if it were only for this song, but there's many more beautiful and more famous songs (Gabriel's Oboe, On Earth as it is in heaven, etc) of which the same could be said. Buy it.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|As we have come to expect from the Final Fantasy saga, this DVD is full of lush backgrounds, a wonderful storyline, intriguing dialogue...etc etc. My favorite part of this movie is when Cloud is trying to outrun his pursuers on his motorbike, wow talk about exciting! I love the Final Fantasy series but I feel that \\"The Spirits Within\\" kinda failed the franchise...it was boring, contrived, and didn't do much to whet the appetite of the die-hard FF fans. Advent Children more than makes up for the last movie...they must again save the world from evil, but this time you will enjoy watching them do it! You will love this movie, believe me!

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Either every other album that came out in 2005 just sucked or Sufjan Stevens Illinois is a truly one of the great ones of all time.  That according to metacritic.com, a website which complies hundreds of the top critics reviews and year end top ten lists for each year since 2000.  Not only was Illinois listed as the best overall reviewed album of the year but it also led the way in being included in more year end top ten lists than any other album.  Within the top ten lists, it had more #1 and #2 rankings than its challengers. <br /> <br /> Was 2005 just a bad year for music?  I don't know, but I do know that Steven's record is one of the most unique and indescribable projects I have ever heard.  I've just finished my third listen through the album and I'm still having a hard time painting him into a stylistic corner.  I've heard it described as indie folk rock but when I think of that description doesn't make me think of Sufjan's music at all.  The best way I can describe it is very talented, well thought out, creative, and you can tell a lot of effort went into to making a quality presentation.  He said in an interview with Pitchfork Media that he doesn't like it when artists wear their influences on their sleeve and he certainly practices what he preaches.  That's why it's so hard to figure out.  So to give it my best shot, think indie folk rock with a dash of Polyphonic Spree and a pinch of The Flaming Lips. <br /> <br /> The most talked about song on the album is, of course, John Wayne Gacy, Jr.  This is possibly the most haunting song I have ever heard.  I've heard songs with tunes and songs with lyrics that each have left me with an eerie feeling before but never such a perfect combination of the two.  This is a song where you turn up the volume, sit alone in an otherwise quiet room, and listen.  It's a song you don't want to listen to too much and actually feel weird for being so intrigued by it, but you keep coming back. <br /> <br /> I think Sufjanspeaks with the voice of a postmodern when he says \\"Oh god of progress, have you degraded or forgot us? Where have your walls gone? I think about it now.\\"  I think he is here echoing the sentiments of the generation X and more specifically the MTV generation and its religious side, the emerging church.  Speaking of religion, you can't escape the pervasive Christian imagery throughout his lyrics, both in Illinois and Seven Swans.  These being the only two I've bought so far and certain to be the first of many I purchase in the future. <br />

Although I have been listening to the music of one Tom Waits for decades, every since I heard Jerry Jeff Walker  do a cover of his classic song of  loneliness, longing and reaching for the elusive promise of Saturday night dreams in \\"Looking For The Heart Of Saturday Night\\",  I am not familiar with his biography. All I know is that aside from his own far-reaching musical endeavors, as expressed in numerous albums over the years, he has acted in some motion pictures, most notably as a skid row philosopher of sorts in the movie version of William Kennedy's \\"Ironweed\\" (a natural, right?) and has provided the soundtrack music to many movies, most notably the Al Pacino-starring \\"Sea Of Love\\". That Waits soundtrack version of the late 1950's, early 1960's classic teenage anthem to longing and love is just the right example of what Brother Waits means musically to this reviewer. Taking that simple song of teenage longing, Waits' husky-voiced rendition reaches back and turns it into something almost primordial, something that goesback beyond time to our first understandings that we are `alone' in the universe. Enough said.     But so much for all of that because what I really want to mention is the \\"Waits effect\\". Every once in a while I `need' to listen to words and sounds that express the dark, misbegotten side of the human experience.

0553565915|1.0|I love delusional Oprah-style stories. They give me a good laugh. Sorry, I know we're not supposed to judge a book by its cover nor should we judge a person by her face, but I knew just from the backside cover this woman wasn't the most intelligent person ever, which is confirmed through her own claim that she didn't graduate from high school, through her prose style, and through the content of the book. How this book is supposed to be the textbook of near-death experiences is beyond me.<br /><br />I'm a wavering Catholic, and I don't know how Mormon or how unscientific this book is, but I know it's not very plausible. Yeah, okay, the light thing in the beginning may be a good transition from life to death, but why on Earth would the three spirits look like three men? For that matter, why would all the spirits have any gender? (By the way, the author's attempt to be a feminist gave me a really good laugh.) Also, if talking with mouth is such an Earthling thing, then why do these people look like Earthlings? And why does the heaven look like the Earth, from the way she describes it? And if we go by the author's words--that all spirits are there before they were born--then technically reincarnation is possible? And reincarnation is a Buddhist belief, isn't it? Finally, it's most disturbing that the demons she saw were half-animals and half-humans, as if ugliness/impurity=bad.<br /><br />It just made me wonder why the author's family hasn't taken her to a mental hospital. She may be well-meaning, but hallucinating all the time can't possibly be good. I mean, seeing a messenger at night predicting the future? That is so Old Testament.
0446577383|1.0|I am a big fan of Baldacci, and the plot of this book is awesome, however, too much information at the beginning makes this a slow read and easy to figure out the end halfway through the book.
B000784WMW|2.0|Whilst I agree with previous reviews as to the praiseworthy likeness of this adaption to the original novel, its downfall is the poor technical production with which it was dealt. <br />There are many brilliant productions to come out of the BBC and who can forget the most beautiful ever - Pride and Prejudice. Thus it is by this series that I look to all others produced by the BBC and why I was so disappointed in Jane Eyre. <br />The actors and the script adaption deserved better than the dreadful location, filming and lighting of the scenes. <br />The outdoor takes are about the standard of a home made movie but the indoor ones are worse still. The fluorescent look of the lighting made me feel the whole time that I was standing on the set behind the cameras in the studios of the BBC. It is garish and completely detracts from the story.  <br />Why was so little attended to? Even the costumes of Mr. Rochester's wealthy connections were dull by comparison to the richly created wardrobes for the characters in Pride and Prejudice. Very dull indeed. <br />I donated my own copy of this series on DVD to my local library for it is best served as a teaching aid to students studying the novel.
0060511109|1.0|This is a truly terrible film. Its first main flaw is that it is really boring, particularly for the first hour or so. Secondly the actors have no charisma and the chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is non-existent. The film trawls through four or five of the most embarrassingly cringe-worthy sex scenes ever filmed (the scene with the tie round the eyes being the nadir chosen from a wealth of stinkers). The most annoying thing about this film for UK viewers is Woody Allen's distorted idea of Central London. When was the last time you happened to bump into someone you knew in the city whilst shopping. I could almost forgive him if it was a one-off, but it happens again and again, as if London were a small village. In a similar vein, why is it that every office worker seems to work at the gherkin? The answer - I suppose the tiny London village must have only one office block. Admittedly the story picks up slightly towards the end, but the lack of any sense of realism is painful, not forgetting you'll have to have an iron will if you're not to wrench the disc from the player during the first fifteen minutes, before spontaneously flinging it onto the fire. Avoid!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Two nights ago I was at the Kodak Theater to witness the BEST concert of 2006. David Gilmour's \\"On an Island\\" stop in Hollywood, CA. It was amazing! 3 hours of music: 1 hour of \\"On an Island\\" beginning to end and 2 hours of Pink Floyd, with everything from Dard Side, Wish YWH, and even a \\"blast fromt he past\\" as a rendition of See Emily Play. It's funny, except for the drummer this is the **same** band that played in 1994 the concerts that are going to be on the Pulse DVD: David Gilmour (guitar and vocals), Richard Wright (keyboard and vocals), Jon Carin (keybords), Dick Parry (sax), Guy Pratt (bass), plus the addition of Phil Manzanera on guitar. The LA date was particularly exciting as David Crosby and Graham Nash came on as backup singers on both the solo and Pink Floyd tunes. It was great! Anyway, the interesting tidbit regarding The Pulse DVD is that the concert program has the following quote on the page that includes David's BIO, and I quote: \\"... A live album and video, Pulse (soon to be on DVD), followed in 1995.\\" <br /> <br />So, wait a little longer until September. <br /> <br />An if you can go to the Royal Albert Hall to see Roger, it's a cannot miss concert.
0316921173|5.0|Just by looking at the book, or at least the page count, you can tell this book isn't for everyone.  There's no linear storyline, there's no tidy conclusion.  There isn't even really a tidy beginning!  You'll be utterly lost for at least the first 100 pages, I promise you that.  But then somewhere around this point, the book goes from frustrating to interesting.  And then from there it escalates into the most thought-provoking and intriguing novel I've ever read.  The Incandenza family is just weird, but strangely likeable.  Many of the reviews here mention DFW's tough vocabulary, but I assure you it isn't as bad as you might be led to believe.  Usually you'll forget about any excessive wordiness because you're so anxious to see what happens next.  There actually were a couple of times in this book when I laughed out loud (Just how many times does 17 go into 56?) and many more worth a smile.  A few reviewers have compared this to _House of Leaves_, and while I loved HoL as well, it doesn't have the kind of depth of _Infinite Jest_.  My only real complaint is some of the passages to me felt just unentertaining.  More than I few times I found myself counting pages until the next passage dealing with Hal and the boys at ETA, or just the Incandenza family in general.  And I guess my other complaint is that I can't find any other teenage girls who have read the darn thing.  This is the kind of book I'd just love to have a discussion on! <br /> <br />Not everyone is going to want to read 1000+ pages for a novel with no ending.  But for some reason, it just works for this book.  I can't even believe that I actually read all of it, looking back!  But I sure am glad that I did.  Easily the best book I've ever read, I know I won't be able to get it out of my head for a long, LONG time.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|I was astonished at how bad this movie was. The editing was poor; the acting was poor. There was no chemistry between the actors involved, unlike the chemistry between Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges in the 1976 version. They made the original remake actually work--no small task considering the fact that the special effects amounted to a man in an ape suit who slouched and beat his chest. The latest version of \\"King Kong\\" was another story entirely. Despite having access to spectacular special effects, fails on every level. Even the special effects were cheasy and overdone. I was left yawning, waiting for the next scene to start. One of my biggest problems with the movie was the gratutious violence. Kong was not portrayed as a confused, albeit fearsome monster who elicits a certain level of sympathy, instead, the new Kong is portrayed as a mean-spirited, blood-thirsty sociopath who kills for no particular reason. When this monster is finally killed in the end, one is not left feeling sympathy, but relief instead. Not only a sense of relief that an angry, murderous beast can no longer threaten New Yorkers, but relief that the movie is over. This movie was a great disappointment and I am amazed that someone could screw up such a good story.

I love a good horror film but this movie is strickly about sadism, not horror. It begins with three very immature young men seeking sex and finding a lot of women with huge mammaries. It ends with graphic scenes of torture leading to equally graphic scenes of bloody revenge. There is so much blood and suffering in this film that you can almost smell it and no great suspense to the plot other than which part of the body will be drilled or lacerated next.
185984054X|3.0|Hitchens' critical exegesis of the late mother Teresa is short, elegant, polemical, but undeniably circumscribed. His introduction is a weak precursor to an otherwise provocative examination wherein he `proves' that the footage the Catholic church employed as evidence of divine light was a fabrication. This doesn't seem particularly surprising.<br /><br />Underneath Teresa's efforts was not an effort to further the total quality of life of the world's poor, but rather, to further the ends of the church, which never seeks to fully emancipate the poor in any enlightened sense. Hitchens quotes Teresa to the fact that<br /><br />\\"There is always the danger that we may become only social workers or just do the work for the sake of work...It is a danger; if we forget to whom we are doing it. Our works are only an expression of our love for Christ\\" (pg. 31). Theresa's work was a `fundamentalist religious campaign' but it was also a campaign that sought support from well known fascist slime.<br /><br />Then we find Teresa's fierce propagation of the church's pro-life stance. She says, \\"today, abortion is the worst evil, and the greatest enemy of peace\\" (57). Pro-Life Catholic dogma may also prove to be the main cause of the aids epidemic in the southern hemisphere today.<br /><br />Turning to page 67, one finds one of the few slices of documentary evidence Hitchens manages to provide, an order from Teresa seeking clemency from Charles Keating, wherein it is shown that she received large sums of money from a well known fraud and swindler. Is this immoral? Or is it an inescapable facet of organizing public institutions? Hitchens believes the former. You can decide for yourself.<br /><br />On Teresa's involvement in Guatemala during the contras aggressive war against the leftist Sandinistas (which she consistently blasted), she stated, \\"everything was peaceful in the parts of the country we visited. I do not get involved in that sort of politics\\" (pg. 93). Hitchens is right to point out false sanctity, but like his trial of Henry Kissinger, he tends to microscope the individual's crimes and failings while neglecting to address the larger structural and institutional features that allow that precipitates the behavior and allows it to flourish.ight to point out false sanctity, but like his trial of Henry Kissinger, he tends to microscope the individual's crimes and failings while neglecting to address the larger structural and institutional features that allow that precipitates the behavior and allows it to flourish.

0930289528|5.0|One can make much of the differences between Moore's now several decade old graphic novel and the recent film.  The author's own displeasure with the changes of his work in the adaptation can be read in many places. Yet in its own right, V for Vendetta stands as an excellent example of Moore's early efforts to push the boundaries of the graphic novel, an effort which in went a long way to revolutionizing the medium.   <br /> <br />Moore saw the potential of graphic novels to explore BIG ideas, in this case the conflict between totalitarianism and anarchy.  Some of this theme gets lost, such as his interest in the notion that in the post industrial age conservativism and liberalism both in the end led towards government oppression.  However, Moore does do an excellent job brining the characters to life and showing how graphic novels can capture a big story.   <br /> <br />Those interested in the medium can see how this effort leads into Moore's later work, such as the ground breaking post modern Watchmen or the very clever scifi/comic commentary of Top Ten.  One interesting aspect of V is that it demonstrates the collaborative effort of the medium; more than a few fans found the art of this particular work not up to snuff.  Indeed, Moore's later work stands out for his collaborations only with the finest artists working, such as Gene Ha in Top Ten. <br /> <br />Readers unfamiliar with Graphic novels may wish to start elsewhere, such as Watchmen.  However, those familiar with the medium will surely wish to read this seminal work.   <br />
B00009UW0N|3.0|Well this is it. The movie that started the slasher genre in its popularity. All of the cliches... dont have sex... dont say ill be back... look in the backseat... theyre all here! So it took 18 years to (d)evolve from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho to this. The dirty secret of slashers of course has always been that theyre very reactionist and subtly misogynist, and Halloween would hardly be the first slasher if it was an exception. The killer of course doesnt go after kids or adults (except the latter for utilitarian reasons), he mets out old testament justice to teens, especially teen girls, who do naughty things. It was shocking at the time, but it also mellows with age. Besides, there is a certain quality to this movie, the godfather of them all that is very period-specific to the 1970s. If it wasn't the 1970s it couldn't really work. All of the shock, even all of the fear, is gone (though the suspense, aided by music, will always be effective). All that is left is art. Its almost beginning to have a \\"campy\\" sort of quality to it. I reccomend showing late night to a group of 13 year olds.
B000031WYP|5.0|This disc proves how important it is to choose the right cast.    Karajan's restrained, wagnerian-influenced aproach is the apropriate way to interpret this opera!  The problem lies with the execution of Karajan's(/Mascagni's? ) vision, which demands a very able tenor, with perfect italian and flexibility of a lyric tenor together with the long breath of a heldentenor.  Such a tenor was found - Carlo Bergonzi.    Another important decision is who shall sing the part of Santuzza.  I think that a dramatic soprano/mezzo is the most effective.  Mezzo-soprano Fiorenza Cossotto as Santuzza is an excellent choice.  She sings beautifully without ever yelling, crying or screaming, but still with a certain dramatic impact.  The fact that she's a mezzo and not a soprano is also an advantage, for there are many low notes which should have dramatic strength many sopranos don't posses.  Nevertheless, she has no problem with the high notes either, and she could have easily developed into a fine dramatic soprano, but then we would have lost the greatest mezzo of the century.  Still, I would love to find a recording of her portraying a wagnerian role.    The rest of the cast is good, Allegri and Martino have beautiful voices and Guelfi is an apropriately violent Alfio.  The Chorus and Orchestra of La-Scala are the best.    Is there anything more to ask for?
B000DZIGDU|2.0|Here's the lowdown on \\"Jarhead.\\"  It's a movie about modern day marines who act more like prehistoric cavemen.  Except these cavemen speak a form of English that is full of profanity and offensive slang.  I'm not kidding--it seemed like the \\"F\\" word was in every other line.  Real educated.  And when they're not partying or hazing each other, these guys are stoked about killing the enemy.  The main theme of the movie is their disillusionment, because modern warfare doesn't even give them the opportunity to shoot their guns in combat.  When they come home after the war is over, they're faux heroes. <br /> <br />Gyllenhall has been lighting up the screen since \\"October Sky,\\" but I was actually most impressed by Peter Sarsgaard this time.  Part of that may be because his character seems to be the only one who has any sense, even though he also has an unreal lust for blood.  For those fans of Jake who care, you can see him in one scene wearing nothing but a Santa hat and an extra one on his head.  Hooray for Hollywood! <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece that lingers with you long after the movie is over.  The film is about two men who fall in love quite by accident in the summer of 1963 while they are tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain. <br /> <br />All of the characters in the film are baffled by this \\"thing\\" that has happened to them because it did happen to them even if they were nowhere around when Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist first fell in love.  Heath Ledger, who plays Ennis is excellent.  Ennis allows his fear of what this love means if anyone finds out, to color the way he walks, talks, and ages.  In spite of the fear though, Ennis finds a way to be with Jack, even if it is for only once or twice a year.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack Twist is haunting as Jack tries to persuade Ennis that they should give up their marriages, buy a ranch together, and live the \\"good life\\".  Michelle Williams, as Alma, Ennis' wife, steals a scene as Alma witnesses an embrace between Ennis and Jack that she knows is going to deprive her of the life with Ennis that she craves.  Anne Hathaway, who plays Lureen, Jack's wife, portrays in a telephone scene how Lureen has sunk into a bleached-blonde cold shell of her former self. <br /> <br />Ang Lee orchestrated this \\"thing\\" that happened to these people beautifully.  The passion between these two men that spans twenty years is as sweeping as the landscapes.  The audience members are left with craving such a passion in their lives if they've never had it; if they have, they are left with wanting to foster and protect it if it's still there or to cherish and seek it again if it isn't.

B000E1YVZU|1.0|I saw the stage production of RENT several years ago and thought it was wonderful - one of the most heartfelt, daring and compelling Broadway musicals I had ever seen.  I distinctly remember sitting in the theatre and thinking Act I was great and Act II was spectacular.  I couldn't wait to see a filmed version of this groundbreaking work. <br /> <br />Well, what a HUGE disappointment.  The film rendition of Johnathan Larson's play was an anachronistic mess that at times seemed so syrupy sweet I thought I'd need a massive dose of insulin!  It also felt oddly outdated, as if it was made 15 years too late.  And, the oddest and most inexplicable thing of all is that some actors who appeared in both the stage and filmed versions of the work seemed miscast in the film, creating major credibility problems!  They actually made me feel uneasy because their characters had a comical edge that was definitely not intended.  This was an odd phenomenon that led me to believe the problem with the film was its director.  Chris Columbus, the captain of this sinking ship,  was completely out of his league - he just didn't have the chops to give it the edginess or urgency that it deserved, and that really came through on stage.  I am not of the school of thought that stage plays never translate well to film - just look at  DEATH OF A SALESMAN, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE or musicals like WEST SIDE STORY, DAMN YANKEES, or BYE BYE BIRDIE.  And one of my favorite musicals of all time did not originate as a stage play and was considered a brilliant example of the French New Wave -  a work called THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG -  that proved musicals could be intensely powerful.  RENT, however, simply missed the mark.   It was disjointed, unbearably long, way too politically correct and terribly dull.  And I could swear Chris Columbus added material to the film not present in the original stage production that further weakened the potency of its story.  So, in summation, this was an extremely unflattering filmed translation of an otherwise powerful statement on a particularly dark period in our history.  Too bad... I really wanted to like it.

The energy, the lyrics, the overall power.  After their next album, U2 became overly political, and toned down (or some of you may just prefer to say \\"polished\\") their sound.  While their lyrics have never diminished, their raw energy and faithfulness to the roots of rock have faded.<br /><br />Pick up this album, and October NOW, and you'll see real rock at its best.  I almost didn't think it was really U2 when I first heard this album.  They have decent albums here and there over the years, but this one is where it all began, and still their best album by far.
B00003CXFV|4.0|When i first saw this movie, i thought it was fictitious, so i thought it was boring. but then when i found out it was real, i was really impressed. i'm not really sure how they were able to document it since at the time JULIA ROBERTS was a nobody. i also didn't know that she used to work at a lawfirm. I mean, i'm not really sure how documentaries work, but why did they decided to make a documentary about JULIA ROBERTS? they couldn't have known what she was going to discover. anyway, i'm really really glad that they did because it was really amazing and touching. And look at all the people who became actors because of this movie! wow. wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
0060934719|5.0|As I was reading the first few pages of the novel I thought it was boring; that was so until the storyline developed in the succeeding chapters. It held my attention in such a way that putting it down would be hard. Tristran Thorn, as a protagonist, is very charming and refreshing in a particular way, and this was especially exemplified when he set out for a journey beyond the wall to retrieve a fallen star for his love, Victoria Forrester.<br /><br />The writing is simple yet very figurative. Neil Gaiman's talent with words becomes noticeable as one progresses with the plot. His preferred words would definitely take readers to a world beyond this one. I can even say his words are enchanted, because they have the power to take anyone's imagination to a place where it's easy to believe that fairies actually exist.<br /><br />Basically, this book is worth your time. The first few pages may be a bore but the succeeding pages would soon turn into something a little more than expected. Fast-paced in the sense that the twists and turns are placed correctly along the storyline, by the end you'd want the story to go on and on and on. Also filled with realistic (in the way humans are), lovable, and delightful characters that are both human and mythical beings along with dangerous, treacherous, and ill-minded villains in the name of power-greedy princes and evil witches, Stardust gets into readers like they too are characters on a journey with Tristran and Yvaine to find something more meaningful out of their lives. A book worthy of belonging to any person's collection, book lover or not very much so.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx about two men who, young and poor, meet in 1963 when they tend a herd of sheep for the summer on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is laconic, introverted and plans to marry shortly. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an outgoing rodeo jock, estranged from his family, who dreams of better things. Isolated and increasingly attracted by their mutual differences, the two men have a passionate affair. When the summer is over, Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams), and they start a family. Jack moves up in the world by marrying Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the rebellious daughter of a well-to-do farm equipment distributor in Texas. Ennis and Jack see one another sporadically over the next couple of decades on fishing trips where they rekindle their relationship, and Jack becomes increasingly frustrated with Ennis' resignation that their association can never be more than occasional and secretive.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a story of cowboys, but it is not a \\"Western\\" genre film. It's an \\"epic love story\\" genre film in the sense of being a stock story of 2 people who fall in love in their youth and are kept apart by social conventions. We've all seen this plot a thousand times, but \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" fails to convince as either \\"epic\\" or \\"love story\\". Annie Proulx's short story is intimate and focused. The material isn't suitable for an epic. The film doesn't have the production values to pull it off anyway. The 1.85:1 format doesn't flatter the Wyoming landscapes, and attempts at grand vistas undermine the core tension in the plot. As to the love story, I don't see it. There is no chemistry between Ennis and Jack and no evidence of undying love. Ennis and Jack seem like buddies who get the hots for one another now and again. Their fishing trips come across simply as nostalgia for a time when they were young and happy, not stolen moments of desperate love. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, the short story gives the same impression. But it's clearly not what the film's screenwriters or director intended.<br /><br />The filmmakers intended a love story with a message (so they've said). For that, the actors needed help from the editor and cinematographer. The short story has no such agenda. Annie Proulx's story succeeds precisely because it focuses on the intimate relationship between these 2 men to the exclusion of everything else. The film shows us a lot of open spaces and wide angles. Poorly chosen lenses and landscapes make it difficult, if not impossible, for Jack and Ennis' alleged frustration and desperation to come through. Poorly chosen cuts and excessive length dilute the main storyline. Forty-five minutes should and could easily have been cut from the film to focus its emotions. Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana intended to \\"flesh out\\" Annie Proulx's story. But instead they stretched it out and watered it down with extraneous material. Alma, who is a credible, embittered character in the short story, has been made weak and weepy. Her acrimony is transferred to Lureen. Ennis comes across simply as someone who can't decide what he wants, and Jack as someone who always wants things that are out of reach. The trouble is that the movie is about two men deeply in love. Supposedly. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is excessively long, unfocused, and unconvincing.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006): There are 4 featurettes. \\"On Being a Cowboy\\" (6 min) includes interviews with the cast, director Ang Lee, stunt coordinator, and animal wranglers on how the actors learned to ride and rope. \\"Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee\\" (8 min) includes interviews with the cast, producers, and cinematographer in which they speak about Ang Lee. Lee himself talks about the film's dramatic themes.

B000EBEHR2|5.0|Honestly, i stumbled onto this band without anyone referring them or any article praising them.  I think each song on here has it's unique melodic flow and sound and Brian Molko's voice is outrageous!  Infa-red is one of my favorites and Personal Needs is great too.  Never since Belly have i came across an album that again i like all the songs and no one else i know does!
B000E97Y6K|1.0|Why do they re-make good movies.  They were good to begin with.  They should re-make bad movies and try to make them better. <br /> <br />This movie was more of a bad video game than a movie.  The special effects were so obviously inauthentic that they were almost laughable. <br /> <br />The first hour was fine, and was comedic.  Then the movie got into gore when the party got to the island, and any thought of comedy disappeared.  It seemed like a horror movie.  And then when Kong appeared, it switched to action/fantasy.  In New York, it was just plain silly.

B00005JOYA|3.0|It takes a lot for a video game to scare, shock, or disgust me.  The only two games that immediately come to mind are Resident Evil and Silent Hill.  These games are the only ones that I can remember actually being scared to play when I was alone.  I think I was about 12 when the first versions of these games came out, and all of my gaming systems were in the basement.  Therefore, whenever I felt like playing, I had to go all by myself down into the basement to plunge myself into the terrifying worlds that these games transport you to.  However, other than being frightening, Resident Evil and Silent Hill had very little in common as far as the focus of the game itself.  While Resident Evil was a \\"zombie game,\\" Silent Hill was much more atmospheric and creepy, with less violence in general.  When the Resident Evil movie came out, I was very excited.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the resulting film.  It wasn't a terrible movie, but they took way too many liberties with the storyline, and the film turned into more a creature flick than a zombie movie.  Resident Evil was one of the first movies to be based upon a game, and its failure to materialize really set the standard for future movie to be based on games.  I mean, just think of the video game movies of the past.  You've got Mortal Kombat (not horrible), Doom (horrible), Street Fighter (ridiculously bad), Final Fantasy (waste of money), Tomb Raider (at least it had Angelina Jolie), Super Mario Bros. (I don't wanna talk about it), Bloodrayne, House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and the list goes on...  To say that video game movies have a bad reputation is a serious understatement.<br /><br />All that said, for some reason, I was really excited to see Silent Hill.  Let's be honest here.  I wanted to like this movie.  No, no, I wanted to love this movie.  It had a great director (Christophe Gans) and a great screenwriter (Roger Avary) and the source material was actually better than most video games, so why wouldn't it be a good movie, right?  Those were all the ideas I had in my head when walking into the theater.  And when I want to like a movie, I find something to like about it, no matter how awful it might be.  To be frank, Silent Hill was one of the absolute weirdest movie going experiences that I have ever had.  I am completely torn on this movie.  As a video game adaptation, strictly, this is by far the best that has ever been released.  This movie is true to the game in every aspect.  Whether it is the scenery, characters, dialog, music, or camera angles, the film is basically like watching someone else playing the video game.  Granted, to write a screenplay you have to create some sort of story to give it some meaning, so the revolving story around the events that are taking place is mostly created by the screenwriter, but it is still an OK storyline, even though it strays from the games (at least the ones that I have played) in a few ways.  However, as a movie, Silent Hill just doesn't really work.  It seems jumbled, the dialog can be extremely hokey at a bunch of moments, and it does drag at some points.  For a lot of viewers, I'm sure, the movie will seem like a bunch of random, nightmarish segments all just thrown together like an episode of Saturday Night Live....but from Hell.  However, for those of us who have played the games, there is a much higher level of appreciation that is attainable here.<br /><br />Rose and Christopher's adopted daughter, Sharon, has a sleepwalking problem, and during her \\"episodes,\\" she is constantly talking about Silent Hill, a town in West Virginia.  After a particularly intense episode, Rose decides that she needs to take Sharon to Silent Hill and get all this figured out.  Rose and Sharon head off to town while Christopher is left alone at home, fuming over everything that has been going on.  They eventually get to the abandoned town (mine fires burning underneath caused massive deaths) and a car crash separates mother from daughter, and from there the movie devolves into an insane nightmare with some images the likes of which have never even been seen by these eyes.  There are some creatures in this film that the images will stick with the viewers for a long time to come.  Pyramid Head is an amazing, unfortunately underutilized demon that plays a frustratingly small role in the film.  When he does appear, however, he does not disappoint.  The dead man in the bathroom stall (I don't know a specific name) is a truly disturbing image.  As he crawls along the bathroom floor, with his black tongue flicking out, and his legs tied all the way back above his head by barb wire, I was very uncomfortable.  Once again, however, he is only in the movie for that one scene, and not much really happens other than we get to see him, and then Rose runs away.  The nurse demons are in the film as well, and their scene easily provides the most tension-based part of the film, as Rose must navigate through their twitching, evil bodies without letting them sense that she is there.  All these random encounters with demons represent about ? of the movie.  As the last half hour approaches, the viewer is given the classic flashback sequence to explain what is going on.  And while I feel the explanation is unnecessary, I do understand why Roger Avary decided to add it to the film.  If there was no explanation, the chances of anyone liking this film who hadn't played the game would be decreased to zero.  Once the flashback is over, the climactic sequence does not disappoint in any way.  While most of the gore is CG, it is over-the-top enough to where I didn't really care.  And there are a couple of really disturbing moments (just think about a little girl dancing and skipping around in a shower of blood from one of her victims).<br /><br />After the credits started rolling, I decided that I didn't like Silent Hill.  It wasn't really a movie, in a lot of ways, as I said earlier.  And most of the other people in the Gateway theater didn't really like it either (there was a lot of laughing and ridiculing going on).  As the night wore on, though, and I talked about the movie a little more with the people I saw it with (who both thought it wasn't bad), I realized that I was looking at the movie in the wrong way.  I can't \\"rate\\" this movie based on how good of a film it was, I need to judge it based on the source material and how it applied the plot of a simple video game as the basis for a 2 hour movie.  Like I said, as a video game adaptation, this movie blows all other out of the water in every way.  Quality, loyalty, and visuals are all out of this world and directly comparable to the game.  Therefore, I have now decided that I did like Silent Hill, and while most people who see it probably won't enjoy it at all, it pretty much did what I expected it to do, which was disturb me.  It isn't a \\"scary\\" movie really at all.  I can't think of many moments when I was genuinely scared, but I can think of plenty of moments when I was staring at the screen saying, \\"Oh dear Lord, no.\\"  And if a movie can make me do that, it has definitely succeeded.arates mother from daughter, and from there the movie devolves into an insane nightmare with some images the likes of which have never even been seen by these eyes.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|It's amazing how 47 minuntes can mean a world of diffrence to make a good film a great one. I saw this movie when it to was shown in theaters and though I soon found to be my favorite movie of the year but as good as it was it still lacked something the narrative was always moving the story from one battle seqenence to another it seemed choppy there so many holes in the plot there was nothing in between that made us care for these characters.  <br /> <br />I even remember asking people which I saw the film with \\"that was good but don't you think there should of been more to this film\\" then towards the end of the year I started to hear that this indeed wasn't the original version the Scott had intended to release but a truncated inferior \\"studio\\" version that had been requested so they could get more showings a day a theaters across the country.  <br /> <br />But now finally because of DVD people get to see a movie that is more complex with charcters that are more fully fleshed out which just adds to the richness of the story also it actually feels shorter than the previous incarnation. I mean the true treat of this release is the film it self but it also comes with a mountain of supplemental material the documents ever aspect of the films production from pre-production to the evental release of the film. This movie is going to go down in history as one of the great film epics. <br />
B000000WFF|3.0|I'm not a big fan of this album as a whole but I really do feel that <br />Never Give Up On The Good Times is a great song!!!.. so if you're looking <br />for more Spice Girls (especially if you only have Spice), then I would <br />go ahead and get this album.. if nothing else.. atleast for this song!!
B000002JOH|5.0|This is an incredible album. When I bought it, it didnt leave my player for a month strait and it was on constant repeat. This is how amazing Pantera is. There are no fillers! The riffs are amazing! Not only technical but they're catchy and have a groove. This is a possibly the best Thrash band in existence. DD rest in peace man, you are missed.
B000001GAO|5.0|A traditionalist might not like this recording due to the fact that Bernstein takes movements like the \\"Lacrimosa\\" and dramatizes them a bit more... but I feel that (even though this might not be the most traditional performance of the Requiem, Bernstein does something that no other recording touches...) <br /> <br />Bernstein romantisizes this work... he slows it down!!!!....and I feel that he conducts it in a way that feels more like 19th century romanticism rather then the classically, square approach of the 18th century... I really believe Mozart would have appreciated this rendition because he was a creative thinker!!!! This is a beautiful recording... it meant a lot to Bernstein who dedicated it to the passing of his wife.. it's nearing the end of his own life as well.... If you're a classical purist and you want a more traditional recording of Mozart's Requiem, I don't know if you'll like this recording but that won't stop me from recommending it to everyone!!!
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|I considered myself a Strokes fan.  I have \\"Is this it?\\" and \\"Room on Fire\\".  They would be on repeat for hours, becuase I could get into each song and love it.  They were great albums, and I was very excited about the release of \\"First Impressions of Earth\\".  But, I'm sorry, i couldn't get into it.  It didn't attract me to it whatsoever.  I heard \\"Juicebox\\" a few times on the radio and got hyped, but that hype was over when I got the CD.  I advise anyone not to buy this album and invest in one of the other albums.
1594200823|5.0|There are some writers who have the knack of making a topic come alive, and Michael Pollan is one of this select group. Pollan proves to be a witty and informative teacher on all things \\"food\\" in this book, and made this reader (who has a very utilitarian view of nutrition) take a new perspective on what goes down his gullet.<br /><br />THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA is organized into four sections, each of which relates to a different meal. (The meals are from McDonald's, a Whole Foods \\"organic\\" meal, a truly organic meal from a farm, and a hunter-gatherer repast.)<br /><br />Pollan starts with the earliest beginnings of what made the meal possible, and then researches forward until the food hits the plate. In the process, the book brought home for me the moral and political importance of what I buy. I'm fortunate to live in a city that has an abundance of stores that specialize in organic, local produce and meats. It costs more, but the ethical considerations of not supporting these food sources is more than I can bear, and OMINOVRE'S DILEMMA really drove that point home in an effective, non-preachy way.<br /><br />There are original and startling insights here. For example, Pollan clearly illustrates how corn permeates all strata of the U.S. diet, and that ain't a good thing. I also liked his confrontation of our avoidance of the \\"animality\\" of the meat we eat, both in the animals that form our meals, and in ourselves as we savor dead flesh. (Ick! See what I mean?) A really well-done book on an important topic.

I kept thinking about it all day at work, and as soon as I got home, I went straight to reading again. Wow. This is an incredible work, one that will easily be among the top of my fav list of the year, if not the decade.<br /><br />Other reviewers have sung this books praises better than I could add, except if you are turned off by the supposed label of 'lesbian lit', you will miss one of the best pieces of literature to come around in years.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I don't quite know what to make of 'Hostel'. I'm not sure if I liked it or hated it, because when I was watching it all I could thing about was how crappy it was, and now I'm thinking back, and thinking that perhaps it wasn't so bad. I think, for the most part, that it's just Eli Roth movies that I do this with. I did the same with 'Cabin Fever', so maybe his movies are terrible and I have yet to see that, or maybe they're great and while everyonbe else is running down to the mall to see his newest movie, I'll be debating whether or not I like his movies. Ultimately, I decided that I liked 'Cabin Fever' because of its grisly sense of humor, and the fact that it had a grim ending, something movies rarely have these days. 'Hostel', on the other hand, had no sense of humor. And even when it did it was mean spirited. But going into the movie I knew it wasn't going to be very funny, if at all humorous.    The first half hour or so of the movie is spent on the two main characters, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), picking up hookers at Amsterdam hostels. Seemingly, there is no point to these scenes, but it is clear what writer-director Eli Roth is trying to say. Later in the movie, several characters pay to torture someone, basically buying the right to kill a person. Roth has cleverly contrasted to world of prostitution, where sex can be bought for a price, with this nightmarish world of torture. He is trying to say that prostitutes are being sold, and now torture is for around the same price. This contrast was interesting, but the movie needed more action in the first act. However, there is something very interesting about the torture comitted in the movie.    In one of the movies funnier statements on how much Europe hates us Americans, the torture cards handed out have three sections that you can choose from to buy. With each one the price goes up. The first is local, the second tourist, and the third is American, which costs $25,000, and it's funnybecause almost every victim in the movie (with the exception about about three) are American's. This was probably the funniest thing in the movie, and it's not even real laugh out loud material.    The plot involves Josh, Paxton, and their friend Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) going to Amsterdam for the summer. They hope to find hookers and drugs, and they do, for a little while. Eventually, one of Oli's friends reccomends to him a hostel where the \\"[girls] are so hot they'll [have] any guy with an American accent.\\" So the three horndogs set out for Slovakia, where they have a strange run in with a man on the train going there. However, once they get there, they could care less. They meet several prostitutes, and go to the hot tubs alot. Eventually, Paxton and Josh hear about another hostel, from two of their friends, Natalya and Svetlana. But before they can try it out, Oli dissapears. Then another one of the guys dissapears, leaving the reamining one to try and track him down. Unfortunately, the two that have dissapeared have gone away to the hostel, which is more of a hostile.    The torture scenes in the movie are few and far between, and those that are there are not prolonged or terribly gruesome. I actually found this to be a plus for the movie. It hardly ever seems like things are left to the imagination anymore in Hollywood. In 'The Hills Have Eyes' did the camera ever cut away? No. And most people loved that and said it was the coolest movie ever. But I thought it was a piece of [...]. The last act of the movie, when the plot really gets moving, is very interesting, and I enjoyed it because of how claustrophobic it made the viewer feel. This was a good movie, but I don't know if it's one that I could wholeheartedly reccomend. It's not scary, but it is entertaining to an extent. I would say see it if you have some extra time one day, and if you like these sort of movies.
B000001ES9|4.0|For a debut album, this is a different, but still a good energetic release. They don't do half bad without Peart. The songs are pretty simple and basic and a bit silly, but they still rock really hard. The only song that made me want to listen to this was the track &quot;Working Man&quot; because I had heard it played a lot on the radio and thought it was a really cool tune. It's the only song that's really classic on here since this album was without Neil Peart. You kind of wonder what kind of albums they might have made if Peart had never joined the band. The songs &quot;Take A Friend&quot;, &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, and &quot;What Your Doing&quot; are pretty cool tunes also. There is definitely no mysticism on this debut, but bad boy Peart would soon come to the rescue, and all Rush fans are glad of that. Enjoy!!!
1592400876|1.0|I just returned from a bookstore where I happened to see this piece of drivel prominently displayed. The punctuation errors on the front cover, alone, should raise significant warning flags to those who are interested in the topic. Skimming the book also revealed that the author must suffer from a chronic case of \\"zero tolerance for punctuation.\\" Those who are really interested in punctuation should avoid this monstrosity like the plague!
B000001ESJ|5.0|I would like to give this recording a five, but because it has a couple of kind of weak songs, it will get a four star rating. I heard some say that this is their favorite, but you really need all six songs to be powerhouses for that to be true. I am getting into Cygnus X-1 a little more than I used to, but it's still not very melodic and Geddy seems to be screaming a lot throughout the track. The song &quot;Hemispheres&quot; is Cygnus X-1 Book II and is far superior to Book I from FAREWELL TO KINGS (I think most would agree with that point). Then there's the weak &quot;Madrigal&quot;, which should have been booted from the album. The three superb songs would be &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;Closer To The Heart&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;. &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot; is also merely good, but nothing to write home about. I think they exhausted their creativity from the previous album, 2112, because 2112 is far superior to FAREWELL TO KINGS. &quot;Xanadu&quot; is tied for number one with a couple other Rush songs as my favorite, and it's almost worth buying the cd just for it. I wouldn't recommend this as your first purchase of this group, but maybe as your sixth or seventh studio album purchase. Enjoy!
B00030590I|4.0|After two viewings, I am still not sure what to make of this film, story-wise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which, for many people including me, was the drawing point.  I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it IS visually spectacular. <br /> <br />It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to, to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience, waiting for just the right conditions, such as the smooth, silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day. <br /> <br />Overall, I didn't think the story was that appealing except for the good message at the end, about the good of all being more important than satisfying one's personal vengeance. Well, who could argue with that?  <br />As for the rest, perhaps being a Westerner unfamiliar with Eastern culture, it's harder for me to relate to the mind-set. I would be interested to know how Asians viewed this story, as opposed to similar films. <br /> <br />Sometimes I think these wild Crouching Tiger-like action scenes are too long and overdone, but at least in this film they were very original and, once again, more visuals feasts than anything else. On my second viewing, I discarded the subtitles and went with the dubbed version to concentrate more on the stunning look of this film. It paid off. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't quite follow everything, each scene is such eye-candy that you can't go wrong viewing this.  <br />
B000EHRVP6|5.0|A lot of people do not like this show because it is not what they are use to seeing.  You know the type, they go watch a movie and have to go home and read what Ebert says before forming an opinion.  Most of the herd are incapable of original thought.   <br /> <br />This movie has a lot of blood, guts, and gore.  But it was an entertaining ride.  Why else would we watch a movie?  I loved it,  I was into this flick from beginning to end.  More than I can say for most of the crap coming out of hollywood.   <br /> <br />
B00003CXS4|4.0|I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes.  <br /> <br />So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so? Well, because I usually enjoy \\"stylish\\" film-making and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy, played by American Brad Pitt, is almost intelligible. <br /> <br />This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film, at least for the first viewing, or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before: the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway, I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on, especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB. <br /> <br />Something wacky is going on every few minutes in this film. The attitudes of the criminals are rough: these are low-life people in the underworld: extremely tough people with the toughest being \\"Bricktop\\" (Alan Ford) who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of f-words in here, too. <br /> <br />The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange, so cartoon-like, that - combined with the unique visuals - it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release , atleast here in the States, such as Jason Statham (\\"The Transporter\\") but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here. <br /> <br />This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all tough-talking, almost-crude men (plus a funny dog). It's so weird, I'll just end with the clich? that \\"this is not for all tastes\\" but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different, you might want to give it a shot. Just remember to turn on the subtitles.  <br />
B000000XB9|5.0|Whoa, I don't even know where to begin on this one! Might as well start with the basics: Chronicle covers CCR's twenty biggest hit singles. Seeing how popular CCR is, this means it's loaded with classics such as Proud Mary, Green River, Fortunate Son, Bad Moon Rising, Have You Ever See the Rain, Who Will Stop the Rain, I Heard It Through The Grapevine, Travelin' Band and Run Through the Jungle. Of course, all of these songs are top-notched! And though they aren't the most proficient band out there, frontman John Fogerty positively sings his ass off on each cut. Anybody serious about rock should have a copy of this.
B000065V3H|1.0|1987. One of the worst years for movies. There were a string of losers that came out what seemed like all at once. There was the remake of \\"Wanted: Dead Or Alive\\", \\"Stakeout\\", \\"Adventures In Babysitting\\", and then this one. These were all losers because they had a shallow plot, a lack of talented actors/actresses, and no moral fiber to them whatsoever. With \\"Wanted\\" every 2 seconds there was swearing, \\"Stakeout\\" was just plain stupid, \\"Adventures In Babysitting\\" showed me that the young were starting to yell back at authority, and this one what people will do to be noticed and accepted in the popular group. I just feel that the world has come to this, and it wants to go even further until there are absolutely no moral absolutes. I witnessed this in my late teens early 20's, and now as I'm pushing 40, and have a child of my own I look back on this, and want to grab him, and run to hide. I know my outlook on life has been altered a bit....maybe a little anyway, but I have to still deal with what my son learns out in the world, and if it's not of strong moral fiber then it must be rid of; this goes for me too. It's still terrible after almost 20 years.
0563524928|5.0|As soon as Bill Bryson was old enough, he packed his bags left the place of his birth, the little known Des Moines and headed for Europe, he didn't intend to return back home but eventually after many years, a marriage and a family Des Moines did lure him back and with a caustic sense of nostalgia and dry wit in abundance he returned to the land of his childhood, and drove across what for him because the lost continent that perhaps never really existed in the first place...<br /><br />This book was recently broadcast on BBC7 over a series of days, late at night I might add, which was not a good thing because I laughed so much I couldn't get to sleep afterward!<br /><br />What a wonderful way of getting into Bryson, hearing it read out  to you, and though he is totally irreverent about the country of his birth, you are also aware that he has a great deal of affection for the land he choose to leave for Europe's chilly shores.<br /><br />Yes Mr Bryson can come across as being very judgemental about \\"hicks\\" \\"chicks\\" and we won't say the other word that rhymes with \\"hicks\\" and \\"chicks\\" but there is something quite charming about the way he rambles his way across the USA, visiting and critiquing places you and I will never probably get to see but he made me aware of a very important fact whilst I was laughing hysterically, for many of us there is a \\"lost continent\\" waiting to be rediscovered and I for one will one day go back to the place of my birth, \\"up north\\" we call it here an England and I can't wait because I know I will probably feel the same way that Mr Bryson did only on a MUCH smaller scale!
0066620996|4.0|Finished reading mine today. The author talks about many interesting aspects that make a company great - starting from people, its discipline, its core strategy, value drivers, etc.  <br />Also interesting is the argument why companies like Philip Morris are a great company in spite of their products. <br />What I also like is the number of aha experiences I had while reading the book. Its only with a few books like \\"Innovators Dilemma\\" or maybe Tipping Point types.  <br />Building to Last is another book from the same author which will make a great reading with this book. <br /> <br />The arguments in this book are very well followed. Every time, I read a conclusion, many questions (why, so what, etc) went through my mind. Pleasantly enough, I found they were almost always answered at some point in the book. <br /> <br />
B000002B2T|3.0|It doesn't sound like Alice in Chains at all, obviously cause Mad Season is it's own entity, but there are a couple of handful of songs that are good (Long Gone Day, November Hotel, River of Deceit). Not great. Most of the album is dull and predictable. I'd only recommend buying a used copy. It'd be cheaper.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|This cd is bangin from beginning to end. Van Hunt supplies the listener with various genres of music such as R&B, Rock, and 80's new wave (yep, that's right). I have listened to this cd with an open mind. Van Hunt seems content on not repeating himself, which I respect in artists like him. He is not afraid to honor his influences (Prince, Sly, Curtis), but at the same time he has managed to merge those influences into his own style. I like the production and arrangements on this cd. Personal favorites are Being a Girl, Hot Stage Lights, Ride Ride Ride, Suspicion, Character, and At the end of a slow dance. If you like Black artists that play diverse styles of music, then I highly recommend you buy this cd.
B00003CWLF|1.0|I didn't even watch the whole movie because it hurt to watch Jodie punched a blow of disrespect to someone of higher status (the royal family). If you have any respect for your elders, your grandparents, and especially royalty, please don't watch this film.  <br /> <br />This film makes it look as though Anna is of higher status than the king. It is not all that surprising since this movie was adopted from a book written in the age of Britain imperialism so the content of this book highly favoured the British. The writer of the book probably thought that she was indeed better than Thailand as did many european countries who attempted to set up colonies over the world.  <br /> <br />Recommended for those who can see past through the movie's faults.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|At Least the Werewolves looked like werewolves instead of werecats this time!<br /><br />And the main werewolf at the end was ungodly awesome!
014240165X|3.0|When I first read this book, I was a lot younger and I didn't demand a great deal from my stories. Hence I fell absolutely in love with this story with it's fast-paced, movie-styled approach to writing. However, when I look back on it now with a more critical eye, the whole story was actually a well dressed-up formula which leaves little room for character development, although the plot remained pretty intelligent nonetheless. <br /> <br />The story, stripped down to the nuts and bolts, was excellent. It twists and turns all over the place, leaving cryptic clues along the way, making the reader continually guess and more often than not be wrong. You're never totally sure who can or can't be trusted, who knows or doesn't know what, and there always seems to be another complication or innovation in the storyline lurking over the page. This book is your archetypical page turner, and you won't find yourself reaching for anything else before it's all over. <br /> <br />However, when you read into it in more depth, problems start to arise. The foremost of these is with the character development. The characters in the world of Alex Rider seem remarkably one-sided. For each of the characters in the story, there seems to be one description that fits them and their entire persona is built around that description. For example, Alan Blunt is emotionless, Smithers is jolly, Herod Sayle is temperamental, and so forth. By far the worst issues are with Alex himself. Where did a fourteen year old find the time to be so flawless? He's intelligent, athletic, brave, inquisitive, he has a black belt in Karate, he's multi-lingual... this can be slightly irritating for those of us with faults. What's more is that the majority of his speech seems to be made up of pseudo James Bond witticisms, which, although they might give us a laugh, give us very little insight into Alex as a person. <br /> <br />Another problem is that large portions of the plot seem unnecessary. While the book is 250 pages long, it could've been told in 150. There are often long action sequences which, although entertaining, add nothing to the story. It's almost as if \\"Stormbreaker\\" was written as a film script rather than a novel. I mean, at the end of the day, was it really necessary for Alex to get stuck in that car crusher? Didn't think so. <br /> <br />Altogether then, if you're looking for a book bulging with thrills and action, this is for you. If you want an insightful book with poetic meaning and charectarisation, avoid like the plague. \\"Stormbreaker\\" is ultimately a thrill ride with little depth.
B00004RF98|5.0|Singin in the Rain is perhaps one of the best loved musicals of American history. It focuses on movies making the transition from the silent to the sound era. Stars Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagan) plan to make The Dueling Cavalier as a silent film until sound revolutionizes the industry. It is created as a sound film, but they have much more trouble with the new technology than they imagined, not to mention the fact that the leading lady has a horribly inappropriate voice for her looks and for the part. The movie is saved when Lockwood's girlfriend Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) agrees to dub the part, helping to turn it into a musical. With the help of their wisecracking friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), they serve to make the film a hit.<br /><br />All of the actors have their charms in this film, even the annoyingly vocalized character Lamont. O'Connor is funny and exuberant throughout the film, Kelly is charming and mischievious, and Reynolds is incredibly sweet.<br /><br />The only drawback is the long \\"Gotta Dance\\" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Although it demonstrates the ability to tell stories without dialogue and the power of dance, it tends to lose the audience for a moment. Some will enjoy it, but it takes the audience out of the film for quite a while for seemingly no reason. The rest of the music is great; most of it has been taken from other films from past eras (think Moulin Rogue) and incorperated into the story. The flapper era is captured more glamorously than it truly was, but it adds to the charm of the film. The film relies on stereotypes of silent films, but it also thrills film buffs with the references to classic movies. This film has something for everyone which makes it truly one of the great films of American cinema.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|I was surprised by Underworld Evolution, as it was a lot better than the first one.  With an even better story, improved special effects and an awsome villian UE is a clear improvement from the first Underworld.  The critics have underated this movie way too much.  I really thought this was a decent attempt at the Werewolf VS Vampire horror flick.  It had plenty of action and gore which is the movie's desired intention.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was a good entertaining movie and i'm sure an Underworld 3 will follow.
B000301YY8|1.0|Hey folks. If you like Celine Dion and emotionally vacuous power ballads that profusely effuse about love but in actuality have nothing to say about real emotion, then this record will tickle you in places that you didn't know could be tickled. However, I am not one of these people, and as such I would not buy this album or recommend it to anybody with a modicum of emotional intelligence. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this album at all costs, and perhaps buy a Kelly Clarkson record -- she does the same thing but with a less annoyingly cloying falsetto. Thanks for your time.
B00003CXAW|5.0|King Kong (2-Disc Special Edition)~ Robert Armstrong is one of the best monster movies made and one realizes what a masterpiece it truly is if one compares it with the horrid 70's update. Fan Wray is absolutely stunning in the role and she is one of the most beautifull stars ever to grace the screen period ( and whom can forget the effective scream that she displays on so many occasions and that scream is one of the best ever filmed as it sounds so authentic). The special effects might look cheap but believe me at the time they were the best the business could offer and the music is very effective and dramatic. I love the monster battle scenes and the story line and script are much better then many monster movies written since. Highly Recommended indeed.
B0006AOLC2|1.0|Volume 1, Chapter 2 begins the chronicle of  Adolph Hitler's life as a young man and the life of \\"too many young men\\" in similar self destructive positions..e.g. it discusses how his ideology was molded in  the effects of 'short term' labor, it discusses via his observations of many others,the effect of acoholism on \\"a man, his wife ,his children\\"[no goals could lead one from initially using a paycheck up in 3 days and eventually having it go the same Friday as getting paid often not returning home until a Sunday or Monday..it blames the \\"burgoise\\" for apathy and ignorance of the long term results of a Austrian society going decadent and tries even as early as these  chapters to sublimely recruit its readers to reflect socialist/communist values(the country leaned toward Socialist Democracy)as being the key to turning young men from nothing to value to \\"giving even life\\"(as  soldiers) to make the country something close to pre World War 1 \\"pride\\"(in other words why try to ever be arrogant enough to think of yourself as being of value, find something abstract to deem worthy)... it also incites prejudices(as to questioning why blacks should be trained to do anything of value ,which could be given to Aryans as well as to blame  Jewish for the change from the neighborhood craftsman being replaced with department stores, etc..He had become driven at some point to seek out the identity of the  200,00 Jewish in a country of 2 million people by searching faces and trying to guess which man were Jewish..The book has an index,while not a complete index does list most of the topics on the pages which I scanned.
B000E97HHG|5.0|2000's X-Men saw the first of the really high calibre super-hero franchises of the 21st century, The X-men, Spidey, the Hulk(come on it was all right!) to name but a few. Like the beginning of all great franchises, whilst being a film of small scope, it hints at huge back stories and since its character development was so interesting, the moolah that it generated financed the more detailed and excellent X2.<br /><br /> It opens to bleached rainy 1944 in the jewish ghetto where a young Jewish boy is wrenched from his parents in a tear jerking sequence. The wire gate bends and buckles to his anger, he is knocked unconscious by the butt of a rifle... The themes of discrimination could not be hammered home more bluntly. We move to the near future where a young girl in the first flush of love is agonisingly separated from her loved ones because she is different with dangerous powers. We move to a sweaty dingy cage where a feral young Clint Eastwood look alike dominates the ring, yet he is a tortured individual with a backstory. These miscreants are given shelter by Charles Xavier at his \\"special\\" academy. These mutants are feared and ostracised by society especially ambitious Senator Kelly who wants a mutant registration act. Charles Xavier believes in the good of mankind but Eric Lensha (our boy from WW2) is bitter and wants to dominate mankind. The film floats between super hero cheese but keeps a foot in reality and this is why it's been such a success with the outsiders in fact Bryan Singer feels it has a Gay connotation! This may or not be true but this is a very satisfying and thought provoking film with an occasional burst of humour. When Wolverine is asked to verify that he's the real deal and not a doppelganger by Cyclops he utters\\"You're a Dick!\\" revealing hid identity and true love rival sentiments.Anna Paquin is excellent as Rogue, Halle Berry is beautiful and is storm, Ian McKellen hams it up as Magneto and good old Darth Maul/ Ray Park crops up as Toad. X2 kept up the quality and consistency and X3 looks like a belter! Good old Frasier himself blue and furry as the Beast, Real hard man Vinny Jones as the Juggernaut, the re emergence of \\"Angel\\" my Marvel salivary glands are going wild ,it's like a roll call of old mates from the Marvel comics of my Youth but Singer a true genius wisely avoided putting Wolverine into yellow spandex, a fact he alludes to in the film! Bring it on X3! JOIN THE EVOLUTIONNN!!!!(eh!)up the quality and consistency and X3 looks like a belter! Good old Frasier himself blue and furry as the Beast, Real hard man Vinny Jones as the Juggernaut, the re emergence of \\"Angel\\" my Marvel salivary glands are going wild ,it's like a roll call of old mates from the Marvel comics of my Youth but Singer a true genius wisely avoided putting Wolverine into yellow spandex, a fact he alludes to in the film!

B00005GL0M|5.0|If you are a classic rock fan who has exhausted the Beatles' later catalogue and aren't sure if you like the early stuff as much, listen to this CD. It will convince you of how great the early Beatles were (something that people born after the 1960s might find harder to believe than those who were alive then). \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" was one of the first songs I tried to figure out on guitar. But I never bought the CD until much later. I purchased A Hard Day's Night to get closer to being a Beatles completist. I didn't expect it to be as good as it is. It's great. As Albert Goldman said, this was the closest that John came to making a solo record while he was with the Beatles. Paul's work is not nearly as strong. A Hard Day's Night is perhaps the Beatles' crispest and cleanest album. It rocks, has great harmonies, and crackles with the energy of guys on the top of the world. After listening to Pepper for the millionth time, you might need some good old rock and roll. A Hard Day's Night delivers that.
0380018179|2.0|I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it. <br /> <br />SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also \\"developing a very feminine figure,\\" Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand \\"Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be\\" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's \\"stolen\\" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care. <br /> <br />All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old (\\"I'lltell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!\\"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious \\"tragic\\" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a \\"monster\\" and a \\"b* tch,\\" for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick \\"the end\\" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. <br />
B00004XQP4|5.0|I totally love this great album by Green Day. My favorite songs on this are Warning, and Minority. They are worth repeat. Minority really makes me laugh. Buy this album with American <br />Idiot today.
B00006G8HX|4.0|I never got into Trek films until I was like 15 or 16 yrs old \\"although I never really bothered watching the first one of them then lol\\". While everyone was worshipping the Wrath of Khan or even Star Trek 4 with some people \\"which are both great don't get me wrong\\", I always loved the Search for Spock. I mean where else do you have Christopher Lloyd as a ruthless Klingon ? Or Kirk getting in a big one on one fight at the end and kicking some ass ?<br /><br />  You also have James Horner's awesome musical score. Yes the late great Jerry Goldsmith did some really good Trek scores as well but I always wished Horner would come back and just do one more. I really hope he comes back to do the score for the announced Trek 11....which will really be a prequel about how Kirk and Spock met on....Brokeback Mountain lol \\"am kidding about the last part. Anyway Horner's score for me is what made the Wrath of Khan and the Search for Spock seem like the only Trek films that are like space operas. It's one of the most lively Trek scores and the films need him again.<br /><br />  Anyway the film takes place after Spock's heroic sacrifice in the Wrath of Khan. His casket was launched to a mysterios planet. There the planet has a mysterious effect on his body which has him reborn. Kirk steals the enterprise to go to the planet after weird behavior by Bones. It would seem that Spock left a little of himself with Bones before his death. So Bones is sorta possessed by Spock in a way. So they need to get Bones with the reborn Spock to form some sort of ritual. I know that all sounds silly but to me the whole Spock rebirth isn't even what makes the film good for me. I mean you have Klingons killing Kirk's son and get to hear him say \\"you Klingon [...]!, you Klingon [...]!.....you...killed...my...... son! lol. To me that's about as classic as when he yells \\"KHAN!!!\\" in the Wrath of Khan. This is still one of the funnest and most entertaining Trek films ever.
1591840562|5.0|This is a book every business man/women should read, no matter whether they want to start something or are already beyond that step. I am not sure whether I got a lot of new ideas out of this book or not, but I certainly got a lot of ideas about doing things I am already doing better.<br /><br />This book also is a quick read. I read it in one sitting, which is partially due to it not being all that thick, but it also is due to the book being very readable.
0967372135|5.0|This has got to be one of the best books I have read for a number of years.  It grips you from the beginning to the end.  It takes you through the history of drug supply to the US from Mexico, the drugs for arms scandal in a way that its truely gripping.<br /><br />Buy this book and you wont be disappointed
1424116155|4.0|This is a great album.<br /><br />Not your normal run of the mill hip-hop/r'n'b, this album has an eclectic mixture of smooth soul and rap, mixed to some great hip-hop/dance breaks.<br /><br />Of course, there is still the Fantastic single \\"Crazy\\" (almost worth buying the album in its own right?) ....great tune, great voice.<br /><br />My only criticism would be the short duration of the tracks, some less than 3 min long (the CD itself seems only 1/2 - 2/3 full....hence the loss of one star...I'm sure he could've crammed at least 5 more songs on there.)<br /><br />Apart from this though, an excellent album especially if you're not simply after same ol' - same ol'  dance/hip-hop tunes.
B00005JOE8|1.0|After the cinematic excrement that was The Matrix 2 and the cinematic excrement of the excrement-eating fly that was The Matrix 3, you'd think they'd be tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail.  But here they are again with another bloated, self-important bore-fest that might as well be called \\"Yawn!  The Movie.\\"  Many have said that \\"V For Vendetta\\" doesn't answer all the questions it raises.  That's not accurate.  It doesn't answer any questions, and unless you're a sociopathic mad bomber it shouldn't raise any either.  Because that's exactly what V is: a sociopath.  That's not what bothers me.  I enjoy anti-heroes.  What bothers me (aside from that the second half is almost as action-packed as an episode of \\"The View\\") is that the Wachowski brothers make V less an anti-hero and more a freaking messiah!  They claim that V is not intended as a hero, yet never do they condemn his actions in even the smallest way.  Conversely, they portray V as a paragon of righteousness.  They even go so far as to say that Guy Fawkes was \\"a great man.\\"  Guy Fawkes was no more a hero than Timothy McVeigh.  The idea that he should be represented as such is nauseating.  That being said, there are a few positives.  It starts out interesting enough with V hunting down and killing government officials who ran a concentration camp from which he escaped.  The use of color is brilliant.  It's visually beautiful from start to finish.  But it takes a serious nose dive in the second half, devoid of any real action.  That is, until the climax, which begins with a fight scene in the same slow-motion style that so copiously littered the Matrix trilogy and made parts 2 and 3 unwatchable.  There's finally some action, and it's THE SLOWEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE!  I was furious.  It was effective in one way, though.  After seeing it, I did want to start my own revolution.  Agains Hollywood drivel like \\"V For Vendetta.\\"  Seriously, it's bad.
0446677450|5.0|Ok,<br /><br />People complaining about this book mainly because it's only an inspirational read and does not go into the details on how to do it, and is not realistic.<br /><br />Well, for me it's a great starter if you have been just struggling for the pay raises and frustrated, or don't even care about that (this is my case).<br />Further, if you think you are making enough money yet you are still in debt (my brother...heh)...<br />I guess that's fine, most of us do, until you reallize that your life style will really bite on you and bumps you out.<br /><br />First of all, this book is about a perspective IMHO.<br />How can you expect to cramp all the knowlege in the areas of accounting, investing, starting a business, etc in a small book that can be read in one seating?<br />The rest is for you to study and observe with further readings and actual experiences.<br /><br />Don't be pesimistic or have too much doubt about your potential to be successful in everything.<br />Easier said than done?<br />Of course it is, otherwise everyone will be rich and we will have to be dependeded on illegal imigrants to do all our dirty works (geez, btw why does California want to kick out all the illegals out, when they are already fabricated so deep into our economy...idiots...just think of a better way to collect tax due...)<br /><br />To me, when you meet someone who has real good insight and character, will change your life profoundly than reading hundreds of dull hyped up books.<br />But this books to me is like the one of those rare chances of meeting a good minded person, will effect you in the same profound manner.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I first saw this movie before I even played the guitar. It is inspirational. Ralph Macchio does an excellent job of slipping out of his Karate Kid persona and slipping into the bright eyed overly confident wieny that most beginning artists tend to be. His pairing with Joe Seneca is perfect. The storyline and ending may be foreseeable,,, but the journey is fantastic. Most movies are predictable. The boy gets the girl, the cops get their man,,,,it's a movie. Made for fun and entertainment. And so Willie Brown saves his soul,,, Big Deal!!! It's great.
B00004TLV9|5.0|WOW - Absolutely Brilliant!!!<br /><br />Having read Angels & Demons, been enlightened about the Rome/Secret Societies/Science web this was explosive, difficult to put down and left me eager to explore more...<br /><br />Forget the hype, and be prepared to open your mind to an enjoyable, charming and well crafted novel, Stephen King manages to scare you and this author manages to open your mind.<br /><br />I was not the 'art-admirer' person before reading anything like Da Vinci Code (inc. Angels & Demons) and Dan Brown informs the reader without boring you and now I look forward to seeing beyond a canvas in the future.<br /><br />As for the storyline, blimey, it is non-stop with characters you will relish reading about and what you will find out in the end is somewhat mind-blowing.<br /><br />Those who are slating the book are free to air their opinions but I am certainly not one of them.  I doubt any of the REAL critics could write a more exciting story than Dan Browns Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Questions of faith, secret societies and codes are some of the topics Da Vinci Code explores.  Robert Langdon takes you to Paris, Rome and Scotland with another reason to go apart from killing time - if your like me who was captivated and inspired I think the next steps would be to visit these places, appreciate the 'spin', fantasy and conspiracy theories and see if we are indeed living life oblivious and ignorantly...<br /><br />Fascinating Read - go for it!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|It's interesting to read other reviews, especially the negative ones. They all start the same: \\"First let me say that I've been a Metheny fan for 30 years, BUT...\\" I too have followed him for a long time and besides sharing in his music, have been a careful and curious viewer of his creative journey. Like some, I have questioned some of his musical decisions, with what I see as a somewhat repetitious and \\"watered down\\" approach his band has taken at times. <br /> <br />But Metheny is so much about musical exploration, and not necessarily about producing music everyone likes or agrees with. A while back he said in an interview that when all this is done, he hopes people will look at his entire body of work and find interesting and compelling threads that tie it all together. What a cool concept that puts efforts like This Way Up into amazing clarity, when viewed as a piece of the creative whole. <br /> <br />This Way Up is right up there with Imaginary Day, Secret Story, Question and Answer, and Still Life Talking, in terms of creativity, musicianship, and what Metheny and Mays do so well - draw you in to a compelling musical space that tells a story. The difference with TWU is of course the length of the work. It appears that this \\"classical\\" form has signaled a very dynamic plateau for the band, and is the album Metheny and Mays have been hinting at making for many years. <br /> <br />I love the way Metheny's guitar takes a back seat in this work, not that he doesn't deserve center stage, but his familiar noodling is so varied and understated - it folds in so nicely with the huge complexity of other sounds and textures. Some have said that this music meanders, but doesn't really get anywhere. I wonder if they have even listened to it in its entirety. Or more than once or twice. The more I listen and really \\"get into\\" the music, the more complexities I hear and the richer the experience becomes. Isn't that what it's all about? <br /> <br />This current PMG personnelis fabulous! Sanchez's hop-skip skittering symbol and snare play, Mays melodic foundations, Rodby's versatile virtuoso, Vu's sassy, street level impressionisms, Maret's rich tonality, and of course Metheny and what he brings - it all adds up to an amazingly complex and fulfilling soundscape, much like Metheny's career as well. <br /> <br />I am convinced that this album will be looked back on as a brilliant high point in Metheny's stellar career. I couldn't be more thrilled to be along for the ride.
0380730405|5.0|Rebecca is a mystery novel in which nearly every character makes false assumptions that lead to false conclusions.  From the catty and gauche widow Mrs. Van Hopper to the suave widower Maxim de Winter, nearly everyone in Rebecca is wrong about something. For the nameless narrator, her incorrect assumptions are founded on Mrs. Van Hopper's gossip and build on each other until they have constructed a person and a past that never existed and a future in which every action and utterance have two meanings-the one that the narrator perceives and the real meaning.<br /><br />For example, Maxim's sister Beatrice tells the narrator that she is nothing like his first wife, the late Rebecca de Winter, who died in a tragic boating accident. The narrator accepts this statement and remembers it as she learns more about Rebecca. She feels herself to be plain, uninteresting, shy, and unsophisticated. By contrast, and by all accounts that the narrator hears, Rebecca was beautiful, fascinating, charismatic, and witty. Even Maxim's carefully diplomatic estate manager, Frank Crawley, tells the narrator, \\". . . I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life.\\" Not surprisingly, the more she learns, the more the narrator needs to know about Rebecca-a first wife whom she cannot have replaced in the brooding, moody Maxim's affections.<br /><br />The narrator falsely interprets other people and what they say and do. The intimidating housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, gives her several hints that Rebecca was exacting and demanding in her management of the household and staff. The second Mrs. de Winter is also told how much Mrs. Danvers loved and admired Rebecca. The implication is clear; the narrator's only hope of coming to terms with the formidable housekeeper is to take charge. Instead, she decides that the best way to mollify Mrs. Danvers is to make herself unobtrusive and to let her have full rein over the household's management. Her na?vet? and self-effacing behavior give Mrs. Danvers a reason to despise as well as dislike her.<br /><br />Many, if not most, readers are probably misled as well. Rebecca's appearance and charms are described by several people in several places, and her name or initials appear on nearly everything she owned. On the other hand, the narrator is never described or named. Even when Mrs. Danvers calls her \\"Mrs. de Winter\\" over the house telephone the first time, the narrator responds with a denial of her new identity but without reference to her former one. \\"I'm afraid you have made a mistake. Mrs. de Winter has been dead for over a year.\\" Surrounded by Rebecca's belongings, Rebecca's servants, and Rebecca's friends and husband, the narrator sinks further into anonymity.<br /><br />There are few clues to the narrator's looks, other than that she has \\"lank hair\\" (compared to Rebecca's \\"clouds\\" of black hair) and that she is \\"plain,\\" according to herself. Yet Rebecca's cousin, Jack Favell, flirts with her and repeatedly hints that she is a fresh, attractive younger wife of the sort that affluent older men like Maxim often choose. The reader should also ask why Maxim does marry someone who apparently is so different from the first wife he adored.<br /><br />In Rebecca, passion seems as repressed as open communication, but sexuality is not far beneath the surface. The relationship between Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers is full of sexual overtones. While Maxim may be willing to replace Rebecca in his affections and his bed, Mrs. Danvers clearly is not. As a comfort, she clings to Rebecca's old bedroom suite and to her apparent contempt for men. Mrs. Danvers says of Rebecca, \\"She had all the courage and spirit of a boy, had my Mrs. de Winter. She ought to have been a boy,  I often told her that.\\" Even Maxim says, \\"She [Rebecca] looked like a boy in her sailing kit, a boy with a face like a Botticelli angel.\\"<br /><br />The narrator also refers to herself as being like a \\"schoolboy\\" or \\"boy.\\" The incident at the costume ball and Mrs. Danvers' ensuing description of Rebecca begin the narrator's transformation into Rebecca, or at least a woman more like Rebecca-confident, assertive, and, later, sexualized. She tells Maxim, \\"I've grown up, Maxim, in twenty-four hours. I'll never be a child again.\\" With her new knowledge of Rebecca, she makes an offer to Maxim: \\"I'll be your friend and companion, a sort of boy.\\" It is this offer and admission that finally elicits the truth-a truth that was under all the cascading false assumptions, misinterpretations, and lack of communication.<br /><br />Rebecca is an outstanding mystery and character study that captures a world on the cusp of irrevocable change. Maxim's marriage to Rebecca seems to have been made in the old tradition; as his grandmother says, \\"She's got the three things that matter in a wife . . . breeding, brains, and beauty.\\" Their marriage is a contract in which each plays a role. In contrast, Maxim's second marriage is modern; it is based on impulse and emotion, and thrives away from the constraints of society and tradition. When Maxim and the narrator come to Manderley, they are bound by the past-Rebecca's past, as well as a past world in which they are surrounded by servants and constrained by a decorum that requires the suppression of communication and feelings.<br /><br />The world around them is changing, however. When a ship wrecks off the coast and a crowd gathers to watch the rescue and salvage operation, a tourist points out to the narrator how Manderley, and all it represents, has become an anachronism. \\"Those are nice-looking woods over there, I suppose they're private . . . My husband says all these big estates will be chopped up in time and bungalows built . . . I wouldn't mind a nice bungalow up here facing the sea.\\"<br /><br />From the memorable opening, \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again,\\" to the well-paced unravelling of every false assumption and conclusion, Rebecca is an engaging, evocative, thoughtful novel that acknowledges the past before moving toward the future. The next time the night is deep and you can imagine both the silence of the woods and the roar of the sea, read Rebecca.<br /><br />Diane L.

B000EHRVP6|3.0|Well well. After the lame Cabin Fever, I didn't think I'd have the gumption to sit through another Eli Roth movie (or that someone would give him the money to make one, for that matter). But here I am, writing this review after spending a day metaphorically chewing over Roth's sophomore effort, Hostel.<br /><br />Experience they say, is a great teacher. While not without serious problems, Hostel is a huge jump forward for Roth as a filmmaker, all the way around. He shows that he's not just a horror movie-fanboy-hack, but that he might be a guy who, like Mr. Producer-guy Quentin Tarantino, brings the whole package to the table.<br /><br />The story here revolves around the shenanigans of three guys: an annoying, [..]young American named Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his [..] American buddy Josh (Derek Richardson), spending a few of their glory days backpacking around Europe with a zany, frat-boy-ish Icelander named Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson). The sex-starved trio winds up in Amsterdam. Locked out of their hostel after a late night out partying, our boys get a tip from a slightly geeky, big-nosed kid about a hostel just outside of Bratislava where they can find all the free love they can handle. Our[..] heroes jump a train first thing the next morning.<br /><br />Roth takes his own sweet time getting the ball rolling, spending a good forty-five minutes - the entire first act of the film - with the guys as they wander around and hunt for drugs and sex. Roth manages to throw in a couple plot points here and there during all the soft-core nude scenes to set up the next third of the film, which is all about the torture and layering on the gore; and finally bringing us to the grand finale, where some of the bad guys get their grisly come-uppance at the mangled hands of our lone survivor, Paxton (with some help from a group of rag-tag street kids).<br /><br />Overall, there's some good stuff here, if you're into this type of thing. There's a nifty cameo from Takashi Miike (of Audition and Ichi the Killer - and about a thousand others - fame) The cringe-inducing FX are some of the best I've seen, with as real looking bloody bodyparts as you're likely to find this side of Rick Baker. Roth clearly likes the genre he's working in, and it shows, even with the rough edges. The box art is enticingly creepy enough to suck you in and rent or buy the movie. Unfortunately, the DVD extras included here are the usual making of documentaries and silly, pat-on-the back commentaries, but the Roth and the guys are so clearly having fun its easy to come away enjoying the experience.<br /><br />In the end, I can't say I'd watch Hostel over again and again - it's no Evil Dead or Night of the Living Dead type of genre-defining classic - but it has enough cover-your-eyes, Whoo-Mama! moments to warrant a review with a handful of stars from this jaded old video hound, and has enough flair to impress me enough to hope that writer/director/jack of all trades Roth improves this much with his next movie (it's sequel time, kids). His could be a fun career to keep a dangling, blow-torched eye on.and about a thousand others - fame) The cringe-inducing FX are some of the best I've seen, with as real looking bloody bodyparts as you're likely to find this side of Rick Baker.

0156027321|5.0|I'm 17, and a junior in high school. I HATE reading books for class. I think it's a complete waste of time. And when we were assigned to read Life of Pi, I was pretty reluctant to even turn the first page. But after reading an exerpt from the book , I thought it seemed interesting. So interesting that I finished the book from beginning to end in just 2 days. I really enjoyed it. I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys good fiction.
B000007VCM|5.0|The Cult may be little more than a footnote now, but for a brief time in the mid-1980s (specifically the time it took to record, release and support this album) the genre-confused British rock band looked set to rival acts like U2 in quality, if not necessarily mass-market sucess, and add some much-needed gems to what was already a rapidly-declining contemporary music scene. LOVE, alas, was to be the only such highlight in the group's career, but it was and remains an extremely bright one.     Having cut its teeth as a better-than-average (though still largely undistinguished) Goth band with the negligible 1984 LP DREAMTIME, the Cult retained a bit of Goth's droning mordancy and eye-linered melodrama for the follow-up while abandoning its diffidence, monotony and silliness. Musically, LOVE is a bracing and ceaselessly inventive marriage of psychedelic swirl and new wave kick, with elliptical hippie lyrics from lead singer Ian Astbury on top and alternating gotta-dance/gotta-drink beats on the bottom to help maintain this delicate balance of styles throughout. The opening smash of \\"Nirvana\\" - a song far better than anything the as-yet-unformed band of that name would ever record - sets the pace, with Billy Duffy's glistening guitar work echoing against Astbury's arch calls for dancefloor salvation. \\"Big Neon Glitter\\" pairs post-U2 martial drums with effects-laden guitars - and the best scream on the album - to create a tune at once doomy and finger-popping. The title track slithers along sinuously, and things slow down even more for \\"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon,\\" a mini-epic whose naive ruminations on Native American mythology somehow manage (like just about everything else on LOVE) to work. \\"Rain\\" is a rouser, an unstoppable up-on-your-feet single with the whole band - and its vision - in top form. \\"Phoenix\\" opens with an extended tribute to Jimi Hendrix from Duffy, whose wah-wahing skills prove impressive indeed. \\"Hollow Man\\" may be the album's weakest song, but it's still far from bad. The flower power sentimentality of \\"Revolution\\" is a lot more effective, though - Astbury's moving lyrics sit beautifully upon their meditation cushion of crystalline guitar strokes and chorus vocals. \\"She Sells Sanctuary,\\" another single, provides a final and very welcome foot in the rump before \\"Black Angel\\" brings things to a close with one of the more effectively lugubrious seafaring tales you're likely to hear on a hard rock album.     LOVE stands among the eighties' finest musical moments, and at the absolute peak of the Cult's desultory and ambiguous career. With their next album, ELECTRIC, Astbury, Duffy and their changing cast of cohorts would take yet another sudden turn - into the terrain of heavy metal wannabes - leaving this singularly excellent and eclectic collection of songs to remain for all time a sort of genre unto itself - as well as a tantalizing promise of what might have been. Classic!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|The movie debut of Patrick O'Brian's amazing series of Naval Fiction was an event I regarded with a mixture of anticipation and dread.  Anticipation because the enjoyment that resulted in reading his books could be relived in a new medium on the big screen, and dread because I feared that Hollywood would do to the books what it seems to do best: butcher them.  I am pleased to say that Peter Weir's rendition of the Aubrey/Maturin novels does the books justice.  This movie is very enjoyable, to both those who have read the books, and those who have not.<br /><br />Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are reunited (the pair did an excellent job in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\"), and continue to perform very well together.  I can say that when I began rereading the series here in Baghdad to pass the time, I now see both of them in my mind's eye as I read, and it has enhanced the experience, not distracted me.  The other cast and crew do noteworthy jobs as well.<br /><br />The ship used to represent the HMS Surprise was the recreated HMS Rose, a tall ship that currently sails the seas today- I believe you can visit the website somewhere on the internet.  I believe the ship deserves almost as much note as the actors, because without her the movie would have been far lacking.  I've been fortunate enough to sail in her once myself, and Weir uses the Rose to good effect in this film: the sailing scenes and battle scenes are the best I've ever watched, by far.<br /><br />The story presented here is composed of a composite of conversations, and events, pulled from throughout the book series, and I believe that this was a good decision.  We can hardly expect Crowe, Bettany, and Weir to produce a 20 movie run.  However, they can take the best elements of the series and (hopefully) make a memorable movie series that is loosely based on the novels.<br /><br />In this film, Aubrey and Maturin are given the mission of `taking, sinking or burning' a French frigate, the Acheron, sent to prey on the British shipping in the Pacific.  The movie takes them from the waters of the south Atlantic to the Pacific and a long naval battle that pushes their ship and the men to the limits.  The Acheron has a seemingly uncanny appreciation for what Aubrey will do, giving way to a desperate conclusion that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This special edition DVD release contains some great special features, including the usual `making of' documentaries, cut scenes, and interviews.  It is worth the extra few dollars if you already enjoyed the movie or expect that you will.The movie takes them from the waters of the south Atlantic to the Pacific and a long naval battle that pushes their ship and the men to the limits.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|I didn't really hear of P!ATD for a while, until my one friend was telling me about them. He said they were so emo, it was hilarious. Being me, I had to hear this band and find out what all the talk was about. Now, I've changed my view on Panic! at the Disco, and I think that this is one of the best first cds I've heard to date.  <br /> <br />It starts out with an Introduction which I normally skip because it gets me to the first single on the cd. \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage\\" is a good single from this cd, but I wouldn't say its the best song on this cd. \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines\\" has a different feel, but is still a good song, and I think its worth listening to. I don't really care for the next song, but thats just my opinion. On to \\"Camisado\\", which I really liked when I first got the cd. It's another upbeat song that I just couldn't get enough of until I overplayed it. \\"Time to Dance\\" is another good one, but this song has much more of a techno feel to it than most of the cd. \\"Lying is the Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\\" is another awesome song, and I would say it's in the top three on the cd. The Intermission on the cd is cool because it is a techno break. The next song, \\"But It's Better if You Do\\" has much more of a swing feel to it, but is also a good song. Moving along, we get to the second single from this cd. \\"I Write of Sins Not Tragedies\\" is a really good song. I'd say it cracks my top three as well. \\"I Constantly Thank God for Esteban\\" is a good song, but I don't like it a lot because it is just a good song between two great ones. \\"There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet\\" is an absolutely amazing song, and it is my favorite on this cd. It has a swing feel to it, and is really catchy. \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\" just misses my top 3, but it also is a really good cd. <br /> <br />The way I look at it, this cd hasfour or five great songs, and a lot of good ones to compliment it. This is the way a band should come out; with one solid cd. I'll tell you that this is going to be hard to follow up with. I really look forward to the sophomore album from this rising band. <br /> <br />Top 5 Songs: <br />1.

Ce qui m'a particuli&egrave;rement plu au cours de la lecture, c'est le talent de Dan Brown &agrave; introduire au cours de l'histoire de nombreux renseignements sur l'art, les symboles, l'histoire... Certes pas la Pl&eacute;iade, mais on se laisse prendre &agrave; cette culture plus accessible et tellement intriguante... Bon point !<br /><br />D'autre part, certaines id&eacute;es tr&egrave;s int&eacute;ressantes (qui rel&egrave;vent presque du fantasme) trouvent leur place dans l'intrigue : des sujets comme la religion chr&eacute;tienne sont trait&eacute;s avec brio. L'introduction de l'hypoth&egrave;se \\"Marie Madeleine\\" est particuli&egrave;rement prenante.<br /><br />Toutefois, je ne qualifierai pas ce livre \\"d'oeuvre\\" : tout d'abord, le Da Vinci Code nage dans les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s... La soci&eacute;t&eacute; secr&egrave;te de l'Opus Dei n'est en r&eacute;alit&eacute; pas cette secte t&eacute;n&eacute;breuse qui est d&eacute;crite. Il s'agit seulement d'une institution de l'Eglise catholique, certes puissante, mais pas plus remplie d'assassins qu'une organisation de foot. Et il n'y a aucun moine &agrave; l'Opus Dei (ce qui montre l'ignorance partielle de Dan Brown, malgr&eacute; l'&eacute;panchage de culture tout au long du livre). D'autres id&eacute;es surfaites traînent ici et l&agrave;...<br /><br />Enfin, la plus grosse d&eacute;ception r&eacute;signe dans la chute de l'histoire. Une chute ridicule, avec retrouvailles familiales et des sentiments &agrave; la pelle (tr&egrave;s clich&eacute;) et un d&eacute;nouement absurde, qui laisse une sensation de profonde d&eacute;ception... On dirait que la remarquable inspiration de Dan Brown fait d&eacute;faut &agrave; la fin. Dommage.<br /><br />Da Vinci Code reste un bon roman policier original.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|If young men on vacation are really this shallow and misogynistic - we are all doomed. The three main characters romp through Amsterdam and points beyond, seeking and seeing nothing but naked women who might make themselves available with absolutely no strings. We glimpse what's intended to be the famous red-light district of the Netherlands, but the film really turns the whole landscape into one big red-light district. <br /> <br />Quentin Tarantino and the others who give the generally giggling, juvenile DVD commentary on the film, have one brief moment of realization. One of them tosses out the idea that the film is an example of what goes around, comes around. He remarks that the young men start out exploiting women, then end up being themselves exploited in far darker ways in the horror house where they end up.  <br /> <br />But then the commentators giggle on, showing that no such moral has sunk in very deep with them. And it seems certain that their point in making this movie was certainly not to provide any illustration of poetic justice. Their point in making the movie just seems to have been to make some bucks by getting a writhing of soft-core porn (verging on hard-core) out there on the screen.  <br /> <br />The actor who plays the prime villain does a good job and provides a few good presaging moments - as he talks about his gustatory preferences. Other than that, this movie is a waste of time unless you are into porn. And then you'd be better off just going into the adult section and being done with it.
B0000025DT|5.0|This is a great Electric Light Orchestra album and hardly needs another 5-star review but there is one thing I want to say, especially to Amazon. <br /> <br />The name of the band is not E.L.O.  It's Electric Light Orchestra.  Amazon has deleted all their Electric Light Orchestra band listings and replaced them with E.L.O. which, while it is a common one, is just an abbreviation for the band's name. <br /> <br />It makes sense for a search for E.L.O. to be redirected to Electric Light Orchestra.  It does not make sense for searches for Electric Light Orchestra to be redirected to E.L.O. <br /> <br />
B00005JOYA|5.0|The movie has almost lived up to the hype. Light changes have been made creating the near-perfect adaptation of a game to movie experience. I'd like to say that although the movie was close to the games there were some slight, but not damaging changes. Key charactors from the games weren't quite developed, or thier purpose in silent hill wasn't mentioned. No demi-god from dahlia, but instead a christian cult with witch burning tendancies.  The cult, originaly headed up by her, was suppose to bring the soul of \\"sharron\\" (not her name in the game) to alessa for that purpose. It was also using a hallucinagenic drug causing the panic of the townsfolk.  The change of light to dark worlds was a result of alessa's nightmares being drawn out of her. I also would've liked to see more action from the nurse tending to alessa. <br />Blending the creatures from silent hill 1 and 2 was not a bad move for the director and his depiction of pyramid head was superb!.  The atmosphere, music, camera placement, and mood was incredible! all straight from the games.   <br />The director knows that some people will pick and prod at this movie, but he by far has made a believeable creepy flick. Christophe gans researched his project and colaberated with the creators, he didn't guess and shoot. The story and plot, dispite the changes, flowed well and even leaves an ending that might spawn a sequal. <br />I loved all the games and this colaboration is a god send(or demigod send?) compared to the \\"other\\" game/movies.  Still, for what it's worth, lets be thankful that uwe boll didn't direct, colaberate, or make even a sugguestion on how to make an award-winning movie.  I could've made a better bulet time effect with a pocket pc and my razr camera phone!.  <br />To me Christophe Gans did it right the first time.  THANK YOU!
B0007Y79AI|5.0|This is a Shakespeare play about the prince of Denmark and tragedy surrounding the family. Many people want to say the prince Hamlet is indecision yet he outmaneuvers just about everyone and has depth of vision. Now watch as Hamlet discovers who killed the king, his father, and how he attempts to get his revenge.<br /><br />The only negative thing I could think of this Kenneth Branagh interpretation is the costume period is not what I was brought up on in the other versions and books. Jack Lemmon was sort of a distraction.<br /><br />Now that being said, I never knew how good Hamlet could be until I saw the Kenneth Branagh version. For some reason I never noticed the missing dialog in the other versions until I was treated to the complete dialog in this version. The filled in parts give the story more meaning. Everyone else, even Hamlet (1948) with Laurence Olivier seems like the Readers digest version. I do not think you want to hear comparisons and contrasts of acting styles; so I will just say this film changed what would have been a nice story to actually feel that you are there.<br /><br />Take caution before purchasing any rendition of Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet as there are some edited versions that may not be complete.
6304711891|1.0|This review is about the regular edition DVD, not the Criterion one. <br /> <br />The DVD is a piece of garbage. IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES. Not only does this waste space, but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if they took a pan&scan print and chopped off the top and bottom, like the Back to the Future box set fiasco. I will be comparing to my friend's copy he taped off TV to see if it is so.
B00005JO20|5.0|Peter Jackson is probably my second favorite director of all time, George Lucas is in first and Mel Gibson is in third. I never saw King Kong the first film, and from what my mom says, it was annoying. The overall film was good but the girl would not stop screaming. When I learned of King Kong being remade AGAIN, by Peter Jackson I was not that interested, but thanks to all those movie trailers, even though I only saw one trailer, they just make you want to watch the movie. <br /> <br />I did not even know much about King Kong except that it was an old movie where there is a huge gorilla, and it stands on top of the Empire State Building. I did not know where he came from or anything else. <br /> <br />When I finally got into a King Kong (Peter Jackson) hype, I went out and saw it. I went with my brother and a few other relatives. My cousin asked how long the movie was and I said, \\"Three hours.\\" Most of the people groaned, just because it was so long. When people groan about it being three hours I say, \\"Hey, it's a Peter Jackson film, what do you expect.\\" My friend says that the whole first hour of the film is just a waste of time, I do not know what he is talking about because that first hour is as good as the second and third. <br /> <br />I find King Kong divided into three parts. The first hour or so gives you the feeling of what is going on at the present time, and it takes you from the begining to Skull Island. The second hour is all that action on Skull Island, and by the time Kong is captured you will feel like the movie is over but there is still the final hour where Kong fights for his life running from the army and the air force, which is the third hour. Since the film is divided into three parts I will put the reviewing to three parts. <br /> <br />New York-1933. It is year two of the Great Depression, and the opening scenes will really show you what is going on in such a simple way. I really like the first thing that you see, monkeys. When I saw the monkeys I figured I would hear some narrator talk about how monkey have been around for so many years and blah, blah, blah, but it didn't. The opening music kind of adds some comedy to the situation, a song is playing called, \\"I'm sitting on top of the world.\\" You get to learn two of the main characters really quick. The Kong captive Ann Darrow, and the filmaker Carl Denham. Carl Denahm, a movie director, is about to lose his current film which changed location to an island, or what he calls, \\"Singapore.\\" After the location of the film was changed to \\"Singapore\\" the producing company decided to kill his film so he runs off with the film stealing from the company. It turns out his leading female actress decided to quit acting in the film because she found out that it was in \\"Singapore.\\" So Carl goes out and finds a starving theater actor by the name of Ann Darrow. Carl hires her and she agrees to go to \\"Singapore,\\" though she does not know what \\"Singapore\\" really is. By the time everyone is on the boat and leaving for \\"Singapore,\\" we are about a half-hour in, and the next half shows you more characters, and you travel for days. And then you hit it, Skull Island. <br /> <br />Part two-Skull Island-If you have seen the first Kong you know what happens to Ann, she gets sacraficed to King Kong or as the natives call it, \\"Tori Kong.\\" And once you see him, after waiting for a whole hour, your eyes widen and think to yourself, \\"Woah.\\" Woah, is right. And for the next hour there is the wild goose chase, you get to see Kong's emotional side, especially in the amazing visuals on his face. You see him wrestle a whole family of V-Rex's, yes V-Rex's, not T, but V. I find that almost every creature on Skull Island is an enhanced version of the ones we see every day. There is the gross bug scene, which I really dislike the slugs, and when I saw it in theater my stomach churned at a characters death just because it was so gross. There is a good amount of comedy on every part of the film too. <br /> <br />Part three-Kong's Fate-You should know what happens from here, and Kong's death is really dragged out from this point, but this really makes you wish that they would leave Kong alone. You could possibly be on the verge of tears by the time he gets near death, because he never did anything. And once agian because of the fantastic visuals you can really see how much pain Kong goes through. By the end of the film, if you think back at the begining you might remember a line that fits with the ending and possibly with today's society, Ann Darrow says, \\"Good things never last Mr. Denham.\\" <br /> <br />Peter Jackson has created such a masterpiece, that you will love this film from start to finish, this version I hope is better than the first version.
B0002XL2ZW|4.0|It's hard to find fault with such a successful album; the Scorpions were already a big name in the rock world, but 'Love at First Sting' propelled them into the major league, making them one of the biggest hard rock acts of not just the mid-Eighties but of all time. Released five years after Uli Jon Roth had departed and the classic Scorpions line-up had been born, 'Love at First Sting' was a solid combination of hard rocking mentality, heavy metal excess, commercial sensibility and the honest creativity of five talented musicians.<br /><br />However, despite its popularity, 'Love at First Sting' is not without flaws. It holds several classic Scorpions tunes, including what is undoubtedly their finest power ballad - 'Still Loving You', but it's also peppered with filler material, half-baked tunes that pass the listener by and fail to stick in the mind. Hence, at the time, 'Love at First Sting' was considered to be arguably the weakest album made by the definitive quintet of Klaus Meine, Rudolph Schenker, Matthias Jabs, Francis Buchholz and Herman Rarebell.<br /><br />It's starts impressively enough; 'Bad Boys Running Wild' is a brooding, menacing hard rocker let down only by its somewhat ridiculous title and 'Rock You like a Hurricane' is a triumphant slab of metal, ticking all the right boxes (dodgy lyrics, sing-a-long chorus and fiery guitar solo). The band scored a significant hit in the US with this single, enough for it to get a mention in an episode of The Simpsons. Third track 'I'm Leaving You' is a delight, with it's rather wistful but upbeat tone and 'Coming Home' became the perfect live set opener, the gentle intro creating a perfect contrast to the bombastic metal onslaught of the main song.<br /><br />But, the sheer quality of the gorgeous mid-paced rocker 'Big City Nights' is marred by it being bracketed by the lame effort of 'The Same Thrill' and the dreary plodding of 'As Soon as the Good Time Roll'. Even 'Crossfire' fails to liven up proceedings, despite its militaristic feel. Hence, the album as a whole tends to drag its feet.<br /><br />Fortunately, the best moment is saved until the end and the aforementioned 'Still Loving You' is a towering piece of lighters-aloft, misty-eyed majestic hard rock, one of the finest rock ballads of all time. The generally tedious nature of the proceeding ten minutes can be forgiven and for this song alone, 'Love at First Sting' is well worth the purchase price.ristic feel.

1558216847|2.0|The story just doesn't add up. The ghostwriter has gone off on a tangent and created a compelling story out of whole cloth. He did a lot of research, but not quite enough! The escape was made with only a few weeks preparation instead of the months of careful planning used in successful escapes. There is no mention of how they planned to get out of the camp until the night of the escape, and then it is so simple and easy as to defy belief. In the Gobi they go on walking twenty miles a day and more for six to eight days without water-not once but several times in succession. Not likely to be true even for men in the best of health let alone men who have already been on a semi starvation diet for years. Then they cross the Himalayas in the dead of winter and encounter the abominable snowman! Give me a break! <br />As others have said, there is no record of Rawicz or any of his companions that anyone has been able to find. In the epiloque written to the 1997 republication of the book, Rawicz offers a lame explanation as to why he has never kept in touch with his fellow escapees. The most likely reason is that they don't exist. Finally it was telling to me that writing for publication in 1956 he glosses over much of the story claiming loss of memory. Assuming he worked on the book a year or more prior to publication, many of the events would have been less than ten years in the past. My own war expperiences- including my time as a POW are quite vivid after many more years than that.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|A few weeks ago I heard the last cut...Where We Start... on our local public radio station. I couldn't help thinking to myself that it sounded like something that Pink Floyd would have made back in the 70's.  Little did I know that it was the unmistakable sound of David Gilmour.  If you love Pink Floyd you will love this CD!!! Castellorizon is a great opening track.  This is followed by the title cut.  Another wonderful song. The Blue is a spacey song...this brings me back to the 70's and the likes of Pink Floyd or Alan Parsons.  Take A Breath is another good song.  Red Sky At Night features some of the trademark sax playing that Floyd is famous for. This Heaven is an okay song featuring some odd lyrics.  Then I Close My Eyes has some weird backmasking/production on it.  I guess it would rate as average.  Smile...sounds a bit like the Beatles here.  The song would be rated fair to good.  A Pocketful Of Stone is nice.  I already began this review talking about the opening track.  It may be my favorite. Actually this CD is better then several of Pink Floyd CD's.  But, that's another review or reviews!!!
B000E97HIA|5.0|I've loved Prince since he first came on the scene so long ago.  This CD ranks with the best he's ever done.  I especially love to hear the (digital?) tape effects and him harmonizing with himself (Camille?) again on the title track 3121 (ala Erotic City), and there's at least 4 legitimate club-dance-hit-worthy tracks on this disc.  There's some good slow tracks too.  If you loved Prince through the 80s but were put off more recently, have a listen to this one.
076780421X|4.0|There are very few movies I enjoy watching over and over and over, but this one is soooo sweet, loving, tender and funny that makes my day. It's light and refreshing, true and honest, and most of all very tender. I love it and I'm buying to keep watching it. Beautiful! <br />
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Hostel is an ingenious if sick movie by newcomer Eli Roth(Cabin Fever) You need to take the situation of three young back-packers travelling to a place called Slovokia for drugs and unbridled sex, with a grain of salt. Just the name Slovokia doesn't sound like a horny young mans' idea of sexual paradise.  But it's the movies clever structure of three separate movie genres that disguise the movies flaws.  Part One is soft-core porn--Part Two is sadistic horror, torture and mutilation with an emphasis on the sadistic--and Part Three is revenge thriller.    Strangely Part three is the goriest with death by rock, motor vehicle and train and that old horror movie staple-death in a toilet. And there's even a pack of feral children who kill for candy and bubblegum.    The scenes in the torture chamber are a bit restrained however just the thought of being bound by handcuffs in a chair while some slobbering cretin is standing over you with a chainsaw is chilling.  The movie is worth viewing but is not for the faint of heart as it tends to be very intense at times.
0156012197|5.0|_This is the sort of tale that a person writes when he steps back and takes an objective look at civilization. This was the point of view of the author, stranded as he was in the Sahara with a broken aeroplane and on the edge of life and death. It was there and then that he met the only person in his life that he was ever really able to talk to- the apparition of the Little Prince.<br /><br />_This Little Prince was the sole inhabitant of a tiny garden-like world that was not much bigger than he was. It was there that he tended a single rose. However, this single rose was both delicate and difficult and finally drove him away. In his descent the prince encountered other worlds with a single inhabitant. They were all adults and all obsessed with illusions: authority, conceit, drink, wealth, duty, facts... They were all ridiculous and very strange. And then he fell to Earth. While Earth was much larger and had many more people than the other worlds they all seemed to share the same obsessions and illusions. He found it a place where a man could own a garden of thousands of roses such as the one that he had left, and yet appreciate none of them.<br /><br />_In fact, it was from a fox and not from men that the prince finally learned a secret worth knowing: it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. Men have forgotten this truth as they rush about in pursuit of the unreal and the unimportant. How appropriate that our Little Prince should receive this most Sufic doctrine of the \\"eye of the heart\\" in North Africa. May all of us similarly acquire such wisdom in our own brief, ephemeral sojourn on Earth.
0345475674|5.0|The novel was one in which was impossible to set down after starting. The plot line was historically accurate, however, not boring in the least. The true and fictional characters had such interesting personalities and led to some feudal and attractive subplots. They appealed to the senses and gave some insight on what the culture was really like - which is surprisingly similar to ours.  There was even some crudely ironic humor amidst the fear, violence, betrayal and many many forms of seduction encompassing the novel. The historical facets of the book also helped me out when it came to recalling significant names and places in acient rome, that were necessary in order to understand certain school courses and movies that were related to this era. All in all, it was thoroughly entertaining and intriguing, while satisfying the need to understand the important legacy left by ancient Pompeii.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I just finished watching Hostel. Being a horror movie fan and having heard alot about this movie, I couldn't wait to watch it. I was somewhat disappointed because the first half of the movie was quite boring and pornish. Now, the second half of the movie I have to say was Cool.  Cool gore scenes although I heard the movie was much sicker and gorier than it really was. Kind of a Chainsaw Massacre and Saw ripoff. I would have expected better from Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth. I'm not sure if there was a \\"rated\\" version of the film. I bought the Unrated version. If the rated version was cut down, then I'm sure it would have gotten a 2 star rating from me. If the whole movie would have been like the 2nd half, it would have been a great and cool horror film....... but, I'd suggest horror fans renting it and forward to the 2nd half of the movie!!

B000002KXV|5.0|Has anyone ever asked you to make a list of your favorite albums?  If you are anything like me, that's a tall order, and your list includes a mix of varied styles.  My list also tends to change over the years, with the creation of new music and performers. <br /> <br />However, ever since I heard The Nightfly, it has ALWAYS been on my list of favorites.  I was 27 when it was released, and it still never fails to please.  I've seen it described as a mix of pop, jazz, and rock, but it is sometimes listed in Adult Contemporary (please!).  It is the brainchild of Donald Fagen (of Steely Dan fame), but includes the support of many talented musicians.  It's an engineering masterpiece, and the quality of the sound is fabulous.  Also, it was one of the first CDs I bought when transitioning from vinyl to digital.   <br /> <br />If you have never heard it, take a few minutes and listen to the snippets offered here on Amazon, and then buy the CD.  Unless you have a narrow interest in music, and the current styles are your only influence, then you too should be pleased with The Nightfly. <br />     <br /> <br />
B0000508U6|5.0|Many people say that a rush of blood to the head is coldplay's best album,but i disagree.While AROBTTH was great and freshly diferent parachutes is just brillant.For their first album coldplay show remarkable maturity their are no bad songs on this album.Unlike AROBTTH and x&y.I think this album rivals the bends and OK computer.It takes a while to get used to radioheads albums(OK computer does anyway),but with parachutes you can sit down and listen to it from start to finish.Don't panic is a smooth easy to listen rock song.Shiver is one the great coldplay love songs.Spies is a great little melody with martins voice haunting and fortelling with such doom and gloom you can't help feeling sad yet the hope is there during the whole song telling us that  its ok.Sparks is a great love song a great prelude to the highlight of the album yellow.It is a well written song and one I regard as the greatest song coldplay have ever preformed.Trouble is fantastic and martin on the piano is super.Parachutes is short & sweet.High speed is a nice song as is we never change.Everythings not lost is a song of hope and rising from the brink of nothing and is great.
B000000H5J|5.0|Hmm...Hmm...first off to say that -Demanufacture- completes the Trinity with -Destroy Erase Improve- and -Heavy As A Really Heavy Thing- and -Short Bus-...well that's four albums so maybe not -Short Bus-. Haha Hung Lo yes BUY OR THE MACHINES WILL GET YOU!<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />Initially, the album places you in a cold setting of chains, gears, and steel with it's title track, \\"Demanufacture\\". You'll notice right away that Fear Factory place a lot of emphasis on the double-bass, and with Ray Herrera (a Demi-God I might add) behind the kit, they couldn't be in more capable feet. Aside from that, this sets the stage pretty much for the rest of the album nicely. Laden with fairly basic, yet essential riffing and chugging, along with Burton's yell-to-tranquil vocal approach, Fear Factory have written an album that is sure to please most looking for something to thrash to. With -Soul Of A New Machine- Fear Factory ended up nowhere at all (at the time getting placed on charts was good!). I remember when Ray had that laughable hairdo.<br /><br />\\"Zero Signal\\" was an immediate favorite, rising from the ashes with it's mellow electronic antiga prime. Then bashed up by Burton, who then at times, especially the last chorus, lays down his tranquil vocals, creating an entirely new atmosphere with each wake.<br /><br />Much is followed through, hence this being a concept album as we all know. Know of Fear Factory's abilities to enhance themselves in what they do. This, classic, is outstanding in all aspects.
B000ETQ18W|4.0|\\"Underworld: evolution\\" is the sequel to \\"Underworld\\", the supernatural thriller regarding an old feud between vampires and lycans, and as such is more of the same. By that, I mean uncomplicated fun for those who from time to time enjoy watching a fast paced film that has elements of fantasy in it, and that lacks food for thought but makes up for that with lots of entertainment value.<br /><br />Are you, like me, one of those people I mentioned above? If the answer is no, do not lose your time, this film is probably not the right one for you. If the answer is yes, I recommend you watch this movie, but only after having enjoyed the first one.<br /><br />Now I am going to talk a little about the plot of \\"Underworld: evolution\\", so if you still have to watch the first movie in the series stop reading now, in order to avoid spoilers. The plot of this sequels picks up where the last one left off, and does an excellent job of allowing us to catch up with Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire death-dealer, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the young lycan she has feelings for. Michael was turned by Selene into a hybrid of lycan and vampire in order to be saved from certain death, but that act of defiance and the fact that Selene killed an ancient vampire ruler to protect Michael, means that they are both on the run.<br /><br />But what exactly has Michael turned into, and will they be able to survive? And what will happen when Marcus (Tony Curran), another of the vampire elders, turns into a hybrid of a different kind, and finally achieves the power to free his dangerous brother, William (Brian Steele)? Things become even more complicated when we find out that Marcus was the father of all vampires, as William was the father of all lycans. On top of everything, Marcus and William s father, Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), decides to meddle and help Selene and Michael to stop his sons. The alternative is chaos, and a world full of crazed lycans running free and wreaking havoc.<br /><br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind. The result is that their story is more believable, and thus more engaging.<br /><br />All in all, I can say that I really enjoyed watching this film, and that I believe that is even better than the first one. Of course, \\"Underworld: evolution\\" is not perfect, but it is so entertaining that does t matter too much. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: To Len Wiseman,please hurry up and make another sequel, I want to know what happens next to Selene and Michael :)<br /><br />PS2: To parents, this movie has quite a lot of violence and a nude scene, so it is not adequate for children.ree and wreaking havoc.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind.

B00006JJ51|5.0|Classic West Coast hip-hop was the greatest thing to happen since, the end of hippies...well atleast it's better than the modern, mainstream hip-hop garbage that is plaguing this generation (and us). The first few tracks indeed carry legendary auras, especially the first two, but itensily in the second. This is genuine hip-hop, not that watered down crap talking about big-money, cars, hoes, or the lame junk that's always blabbering in almost every artists mouth today.<br /><br />My favorites include the first three tracks (Damn are they good), \\"8 Ball\\", and \\"Express Yourself\\". After this Ice Cube would make his stunning solo career, and after a couple more Dr. Dre would solidify his career, and oh would it be worth it.<br /><br />We should all notice that even after TWENTY YEARS these guys are still loved, idolized, and most importantly, listened to. Today you hear the new hip-hop/rap artists, and in about a few months/one year you will forget that they even existed. I wish whoever was looking into the barrel of that gun and all the original members of NWA on the cover was: 50 Cent, Nelly, Kanye West, Fat Joe, Usher, T-Pain, Mike Jones, Paul Wall, any idiot with Lil' in their name, Young Jeezy, Jay-Z, the b**ch from Black-Eyed Peas, Fred Dursts, G-Unit, D4L, Kid Rock, and a countless slew of other disgraces to hip-hop and rap. Praise the name that improved the game, listen to some true rap.
0743454537|1.0|I found so many things about this book that made it totally unbelievable beginning with the character of Anna whose mind works more like a 30 year old than a teenager such as commenting on the name and price of cocktails.  Not many lawyers are going to take a case without pay and spend this much time and become this emotionally involved.  A mother who is also a lawyer isn't going to put herself in such a compromising position as Sara (and when did she find time to do all this -- legal work and mother of sick child).  The coincidences just keep occurring: child advocate exlover of lawyer, son an arsonist with father a fireman, then father an EMT who rescues his daughter.  And that ending was just too pat.  In short, this is a good \\"beach read\\" but nothing of real substance here, and too bad because the subject is worth exploring

B000E97Y6K|5.0|Though I'll always have a special place in my nostalgic heart for the black and white version, this re-make is excellent! Though this screenplay sometimes risked going 'over the top' with the action scenes between people and various creatures, I loved it. Worth watching over and over. The fact that they've come so far in special effects helped add to the immense impact of this movie. Also, having the characters in color helps one see the facial expressions of the actors, and the facial expressions and emotions shown through the eyes increases the intensity and enhances the bond between 'beauty and beast'. Oustanding, excellent...and a special bravo for Jack Black who played his character with great concentration and flare.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

B000001DU5|4.0|Tears For Fears was one of the hottest bands of the 80's. The band consisted of two men: Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith.   Their crisp pop/rock hippy-ish tunes and stadium rockers cemented the band's position on the charts and their status in rock history.    Although many consider Tears For Fears a nostalgic act that was begging to vanish away; their classics cannot be denied: the Beatlesque Sowing The Seeds Of Love, the anthemic mega hit Everybody Wants To Rule The World, the mellow Woman In Chains, the stadium rockers and fan favorites Shout and Head Over Heals, the elusive Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down), and the groovy Mothers Talk.    Even though the band are not as big as they used to be, shed no tears for Tears For Fears, their best 80's music is timeless and it's all here on Tears Roll Down.    Recommended    B-
0446310786|4.0|I was shocked to see such a classic on Amazons best sellers list. I read this book 18 years ago in High School as an assignment. I can still remember the name of the main character Scout and I can vividly remember the writing brought her to life. It seems as if I was there, I remember the hot court room where her father defended a black man accused of rape of a \\"White trash\\" woman. I can remeber scout being attacked in the woods while wearing a halloween costume.I remember the sounds, and darkness almost as if it was a memory. For a book to leave such a mark on a 16 year old 18 years ago is a feat. If you love literature and vivid living writing you will love this book.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I just finished watching this DVD and I am so disappointed.  It is not only bad, it's boring.  The so-called \\"youthful take\\" on the story results in true tedium.   <br /> <br />There are a few films which, having been made, beg for the material to be retired because the film is so superlative.  Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is one; the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice is another.  Anyone truly wishing to experience a film version of Jane Austen's magnificent book should rent the A&E version.  No one can hold a candle to Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, especially these two twits in this movie. <br /> <br />Let me say that I like Keira Knightley, just not here.  I can't fathom why she was given an Oscar nomination.  And Matthew MacFayden was painfully dull as Mr. Darchy.  He had one expression - sullen - throughout, and the switch to loving Elizabeth came totally out of left field.  I didn't believe it for a second.  The two had no chemistry.   <br /> <br />Then there are the period details which are woefully wrong.  The older women like Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine were dressed in fashions 20 years out of date, while the younger women appeared to be wearing \\"early American pioneer\\" clothes in half the scenes.  And what was up with everyone's hair?  Elizabeth runs around with her hair down, in town!  That NEVER would have happened.  Don't get me started on Judi Dench's hair.  Yikes.  And it appeared that none of the Bennets owned a comb. Also, I know the director was going for realism, but how many shots of muddy hemlines did we need?   <br /> <br />All in all, I have to wonder why Hollywood bothered.  Was Keira Knightley that keen on butchering the role of Elizabeth Bennett?    Have we really grown so stupid as a society that we require \\"Jane Austen for Dummies\\" versions of her books?  Or have our attention spans grown so short that people can neither read the book nor watch the 5+ hours of the miniseries?  If that's the case, than I am sad.   This film was a waste oftime, of talent (Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn were underutilized), and of celluloid.  Do yourself a favor and skip it.
1400079179|4.0|What Dan Brown has done is take the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail and put it into a fictional plot. I find the theory of Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene a bit far fetched but there are small pieces of evidence in the new testament that Mary M. did things for him that only a wife was allowed to do. Example annoint him for burial, wash his feet etc. This book is not for Christian fundamentalists because they will find it very blasphemous. It is a nice little mystery/thriller plot with religious implications that are starting people thinking about things they have always taken for granted about Christianity.The plot is a typical Dan Brown plot formula:highly intelligent man gets involved with a highly intelligent woman, after her father is murdered,lots of mystery in who the real bad guy is, secret socities come into play, and the hero and heroine are together in the end.It is Dan Brown's situational settings that make his books so good. I will definately be going to see the movie.

B00005ASHM|4.0|Over the years I have reached the conclusion that Pet Sounds is the most overrated album in pop history. I first heard the record in 1973, my girlfriend at the time was a Beach Boys fan. Her brother liked the band but was off at college. He left the records he considered &#34;uncool&#34; at home, that is how I got to know the Beach Boys. The record brings back happy memories and it is still a nice album. It is a good example of well-crafted 1960s pop. There are four hit singles on the record: God Only Knows, Wouldn't It Be Nice, Sloop John &#34;B&#34; and Caroline No. They are good songs. God Only Knows is a great song. The rest of the album is pleasant but it sounded dated in 1973.<br /><br />Brian Wilson, who wrote the music and produced the album, hired the same L.A. session musicians who had helped create Phil Spector's wall of sound. The album was recorded in 1965 and 1966. The lyrics are pre-Dylan and were really written with a teenage female audience in mind. I never understood why the critics loved this album. It appeared at #2 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. For me, it's not really on a par with my favorite 1960s recordings by The Beatles, Van Morrison, King Crimson, Hendrix, Stones, Zappa and Bob Dylan. For me, Pet Sounds is just a good 1960s pop album.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Ms. Olstead may be barely old enough to drive, but she's no kid when she sings (Just listen to \\"Summertime\\"). She was born to sing and proves it on this CD. Her feel for the music and ability to change her style to suit it are remarkable. I'm betting that we'll be listening to this young woman for a long, long time.
B00006RINF|4.0|I like Lacuna Coil, though not so much as I like Evanescence or Nightwish.  I agree with previous reviewers who say the three shouldn't be compared in that their styles are different, but they all are similar in that they are darker rock bands with female lead singers.<br /><br />Cristina Scabbia has a good voice.  I think the male singer has an interesting voice more than a good one, but it's not bad.  The first songs on this CD were awesome--my favorite was Swamped--but after you get past track five, they all sound alike.<br /><br />And while I liked the vocals on everything, the lyrics failed to impress me.  There isn't much to them.  But then again, they're an Italian band, not native English speakers, so I cut them some slack there.  I've heard much worse lyrics, too, it's just they aren't extraordinarily creative and it's mostly the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />I would say you shoud try out this CD, but I won't necessarily buy a whole CD of Lacuna Coil's again.  I want a couple songs off Karmacode, so I'm going to buy them off of iTunes instead of spending $15 on a CD I won't like all the songs on.  I reccommend you do the same.<br /><br />This gets a 3.5 out of me, and what I liked by them, I really liked, but it's too repetitive.
0375831002|5.0|The summary in the review above lets you know what this book is about, but until you sit and swim in its poetic language, its vivid characters, and visceral tragedy, you won't understand the power of the Book Thief.  I'm a bookseller, and I've been handing this book to everyone who comes in my store, with whom I work, and my family and friends.  Markus Zusak uses language physically; dozens of times I felt punched in the stomach by a jab of a phrase.  Over the last twenty or thirty pages, I held my breath, I cried for an hour, and I had to tell my wife not to talk to me until I finished.  I have never read a story about war and love and life and death that has broken my heart so completely with its poetry and truth.  Congratulations to Markus Zusak on creating a novel that really should be around forever. <br /> <br />PS- I have to agree with previous reviewers that while this is being marketed as a young adult book (and I think high-schoolers should read this) adults will not be disappointed.  I would not give it to a child younger than high-school age because of some PG-13 language and the difficulty level.  This is heady stuff, beautifully wrought, but not simple.

Al Shephard - Smilin' Al of the Cape/Icy Commander - , Chuck Yeager, John Glenn \\"the flying monk\\" - are all sliced and diced by Wolfe's samurai sharp, if not unsympathetic, sword. A  brilliant work on patriotism, heroism and American masculinity, with none of the dull twaddle that characterises Wolfe's later works (particularly Man in Full).sehr gut gefallen und ich hab es gleich ausgelesen. Mary Alice Monroe fesselt einem von der ersten Seite an.

B00005JOWR|4.0|If you're anything like me, you've probably gotten pretty annoyed by the anti-smoking crowd these days.  I swear, if cigarettes are cancer, some of these people are chemotherapy.  We've all seen those obnoxious TRUTH ads where a bunch of unkempt, college-know-it-all types harass people trying to do their jobs and use all kinds of manipulative devices and questionable \\"facts\\" to push their anti-cigarette agenda (I should note in passing that I've never had a cigarette in my life, so I don't have a horse in this particular race).  With their prohibitive taxes and bans on smoking on private property, they've become even more controlling and arrogant lately, as they've done everything but force smokers to enjoy their habit in their basements while wearing haz-mat suits and spraying a fire extinguisher after each puff.  Whatever happened to personal choice?  Whatever happened to independent thought?  Whatever happened to open and honest debate?  Well, Thank You For Smoking is here to address those very questions for your viewing pleasure, with plenty of hilarious moments to accompany its amoral anti-message.<br /><br />Based on the excellent comic novel by Christopher Buckley, Thank You For Smoking isn't a satire so much as a classic black comedy in the Dr. Strangelove mold (not to say this movie is as good as Dr. Strangelove; I'm not about to commit movie heresy), aiming less to critique anything in particular than to defend the indefensible, so to speak.  The indefensible in this case is Nick Naylor, divorced father and fast-talking vice-president of the Academy for Tobacco Studies, a Washington firm that lobbies on behalf of Big Tobacco.  In lieu of a conventional plot, the movie basically just consists of a series of looks into Nick's life and work, with tons of little asides, flashbacks, and voice-overs from Nick giving it a sort of stream-of-consciousness feel.  The tone of the whole thing is pretty slick and smirky, but given its subject matter and protagonist I really don't think it could've worked any other way.  Aaron Eckhardt, who hasn't really impressed me that much in the past, was seemingly born for the role of Nick, as he pretty much embodies what I imagine a tobacco lobbyist would have to be like: cynical, smarmy, and utterly resistant to idealism of any sort.  He's made himself a pretty nice living by exempifying the truism that if you argue correctly you're never wrong, and he always manages to find a way to undercut the emotional appeals of the moralists who think they have him in a rhetorical corner.  Nick is actually rather similar to Nicolas Cage's soulless gun dealer from Lord of War, but not quite as much of a moral vacuum.  Nick's a friendly enough type, and a good dad to his too-smart-for-his-age son, but his line of work has made him very good at compartmentalizing and playing the role of devil's advocate.  I for one couldn't help but like the guy, especially since many of those on the other side were so obnoxious.  Besides, he's gotta pay the mortgage somehow, as he points out in what he terms the \\"yuppie Nuremberg defense.\\"<br /><br />It also helps that for such a short movie, Thank You For Smoking manages to generate a lot of memorable supporting characters, even if it doesn't quite have the time to develop them all.  Thankfully, Nick's informal membership in the MOD (as in Merchants of Death) squad, one of my favorite aspects of the novel, made it into the movie, and the roles of Nick's compatriots were cast about as well as you could hope for.  Maria Bello was a bit underused as alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, but she's still just as great as she was in A History of Violence, and David Koechner is brilliantly over the top in the role of vaguely rednecky gun advocate Bobby Jay Bliss (sure, it's not all that different from the role he played in Anchorman, but it's funny just the same).  The MOD Squad's lunch meetings provide some of the most blackly funny moments in the movie, as Nick, Polly, and BobbyJay compare strategies and death tolls and argue about who's the most hated.  It's sort of interesting in a morbid way, seeing three people brought together by the common bond of their seemingly despicable jobs.<br /><br />Going outside Nick's main circle, the movie provides a pretty unflattering portrayal of those who inhabit Washington in general, which isn't really anything new but still ends up being pretty refreshing in this case.  If there's one thing Thank You For Smoking makes clear, it's that lobbyists aren't the only people in the District with their hands dirty.  The movie shows us a political climate where pretty much everybody has a hidden agenda, from Katie Holmes's scheming reporter to J.K. Simmons's backstabbing boss to William H. Macy's grandstanding senator, all of whom make Nick look downright decent.  Indeed, the most honorable character in the movie is probably The Captain, the drawling, unreconstructed tobacco magnate who founded Nick's lobbying firm.  Brought to memorable life by Robert Duvall in what's basically a series of cameos, the Captain may have gotten rich by selling a hazardous product, the movie seems to be saying, but at least he's not bullying or manipulating people.<br /><br />In the end, how much you like Thank You For Smoking will probably come down to your stance on smoking itself.  If you think cigarettes are a scourge and those who produce them the embodiment of evil, you probably won't be able to make much of a connection with this movie's impious stance.  However, if you think the U.S of late has become too PC, too uptight, and too totalitarian, you'll probably appreciate seeing something that (at least partially) turns the moral tables for once.  Sure, it probably won't change the world, but Thank You For Smoking should at least help you laugh at it.rategies and death tolls and argue about who's the most hated.

B00005JNEW|5.0|I read the book this film was based on several years ago and thought it was absolutely riveting.  This movie truly captures the spirit of the book in a way that few adaptations can.  True, in the book, and in real life, the Permian Panthers met the Dallas Carter Cowboys in the semi-final game of the state playoffs and not the championship game, but the end result was the same. <br /> <br />The film follows a season of Odessa (Texas) Permian High School football and anyone from anywhere near the area has heard about West Texas football and how seriously it's taken by the inhabitants of the region.  Permian plays it's home games in a $20 million football stadium, an amazing thing for a high school to have.  High School football is almost always played on Friday evenings during the fall, hence the title \\"Friday Night Lights\\". <br /> <br />But this is not your typical movie depiction of sports, it's based on a real story like most movies about sports, but it differs in that it's much more real.  In this movie are all the ugly things that as much make up life as all the good things.  Early in the season the star player, Boobie Miles, blows out his knee and has to come to grips with the fact that he'll never be the same player, never go to the big-time college football school, never go to the pros.  He's 17, almost an adult and the only thing he is prepared to do in life is play football, and now he is physically unable to do that. <br /> <br />We also see the intense pressure leveled on the coach, Gary Gaines, to succeed; in Permian a good season isn't enough, a State Championship is always expected.  After the second early season loss, coach Gaines and his family arrive late at night back to their house, only to see about 30 \\"For Sale\\" signs planted by angry fans in his front yard. <br /> <br />In the end, the Panthers triumph, not on the field, not as a team, but individually, each knowing in his heart that he did everything possible to win.  And three players a coupleof days after the final game meet at the parking lot of the high school, and each go their seperate ways.  The QB tossing a ball off to a group of kids playing in a nearby field as he walks away. <br /> <br />And in real life, for 95% of high school football players, and 95% of college football players for that matter, that is the reality of football.  The last game for your school is the last game that you will ever play.  Football is unique in that respect, you don't see adult football leagues like you do soccer, baseball, softaball, volleyball, etc. leagues.  Once your school career is over, the game is done with you.  All you will ever do from now on is watch. <br /> <br />And the movie catches this poignancy perfectly, one of the most beautiful endings I've ever seen in a film.  The overall feel of the movie is more that of a documentary than of a dramatic presentation.  And it's wonderfully done.  Even if you hate sports movies in general, you should watch this one.  It's different, wonderful, and not to be missed.  You'll be sorry if you do.
B000060OFT|5.0|By: A.L.G. <br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes star in the tragedy Romeo and Juliet. Comparing the old movie to Luhrman's, I can tell Zeffirelli's wersion is geared towards a much younger audience. Luhrman has done a great job attracting a younger audience to an oldtime classic and favourite. Ho attracts a younger audience by setting the movie in modern time, with gun fights and cars. I dont want people to get me wrong, but given the option to watch Zefirelli's version or Luhrman's, I would have to pick Luhrman's version hands down. If Shakespeare were aive today I believe that he would want to attract a muti-aged audience. This move has a liitle bit of everything for the audience. Those who enjoyed the old version, will enjoy the new movie because the actors speak in fifteenth century old english. Although it is not spoken fluently it is a well done movie.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Team America: World Police's big problem is that while the idea is funny, it's one of the few things about it that is. There are a few good jokes (such as Sean Penn's vision of Saddam's Iraq as a Willy Wonkaland of chocolate rivers and lollipop trees) and it's almost refreshing to see an unashamedly right-wing comedy that picks solely on liberal targets in an age when Bush and co are just too easy targets, but it falls flat as satire by going for only the very softest targets and feels like an SNL sketch that somehow got dragged out to feature length. Indeed, comparison to Superthunderstingcar, the still breathtakingly brilliant 5-minute Dudley Moore and Peter Cook sendup of Thunderbirds from the mid-60s only heightens the film's shortcomings. Even the songs are at best only mildly amusing compared to the relentless comic genius on display in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. The production design and sets are quite magnificent, but there's not enough here for a one-off TV show let alone a feature. Forget the politics, this just ain't nearly funny enough.
0812968255|5.0|I have two translations of this book--one by Andy Fiala, and the the other by Gregory Hays. Hays' is far superior, and comes through very clear. I found it surprising how much different translations were and would highly recommend juxtaposing different versions before making any purchase.  <br /> <br />Most of the reviews below did a wonderful job describing the book already, so I feel no need to; but will add that Marcus Aurelius was a great and virtuous Roman emperor who could of had it all but instead demonstrated the beauty in living simply with self-discipline, self-mastery, and self-control.
B00080ZG10|5.0|The Aviator is a real surprise. I was expecting another aimless and repetitive Scorsese ramble at best, and was dreading far worse from John Logan's presence as screenwriter (this is the same John Logan who wrote Bats, The Time Machine and Star Trek Nemesis). Instead it turned out to be one of the very best films of the past year, managing to mix and match the epic public aspirations and the private hell of Hughes remarkably successfully. Not just a movie-buff's outing, the darkness is always present (who'd have thought bathrooms could be so terrifying?), always threatening, and the film's final image of Hughes horribly trapped in his obsession is genuinely disturbing. DeCaprio's performance was superb, catching the public face of Hughes so convincingly that he sold the film's interpretation of his private one and serving as a reminder of why he used to be regarded as a great actor before [i]Titanic[/i] turned him into a much reviled icon for the resentful boyfriends of smitten teenage girls. It's impossible to think of another actor of his generation giving such a fearless performance.     Excellent supporting performances too, especially Alan Alda, John C. Reilley and, most surprisingly, Kate Beckinsale, who overcomes being physically far too slight for Ava Gardner by capturing her strength surprisingly well. Jude Law made a bit of a pig's ear of Errol Flynn, though: they should have hired Nathanial Parker, who does a pretty neat Errol instead. Fabulous cinematography from Robert Richardson, capturing the evolution of color processes from the relevant eras with real skill and subtlety. And looking at how much more impressive Scorsese's version of the dogfights in Hell's Angels were than the real thing - not to mention that astonishing, almost apocalyptic crash sequence - it's a shame he wasn't around in 1930 to make it for real!
B000002I27|5.0|The Doors had already achieved mainstream success with their smash hit album \\"The Doors\\", and from the hype that came of that exceptional studio album, they knew their follow-up album would have to be commercially appealling. \\"Strange Days\\", while producing several radio hits, can ultimately be seen as the band's most eerie, psychedelic work.<br /><br />While their radio hits like \\"Moonlight Drive\\" had soothing, delecate melodies, other classics like \\"People are Strange\\" and the self titled track swift through dark, fluid rhythms, while Morrison's voice sounds gorgeously sinister. \\"Love Me Two Times\\" is The Doors at their bluesy best, with phenomenal guitar riffs from Krieger driving this song the whole way. \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\" features a haunting vocal from Morrison and a fluorescent melody behind him. \\"Unhappy Girl\\" experiments with entirely different musical sounds, and is a refreshing song. \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\" is an upbeat number, with Manzarek's aggressive, lively organ being the backbone of the track. \\"I Can't See Your Face on my Mind\\" is another dark composition with another lovely, almost intoxicating melody. \\"Strange Days\\" closes in a similar vein compared to their debut. It finishes with the longest song on the album, an epic work entitled \\"When The Music's Over\\". The composition moves along steadily off Krieger's clean guitar sound and the energetic organ work from Manzarek. Morrison also incorporates his unique, thunderous vocal.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Strange Days\\" is definitely not a Doors album to be overlooked, featuring some of their darkest compositions and eerie melodies. Jim Morrison's poetry is perfectly conveyed in these songs, and his moving vocals only enhance the listening experience. This album produced a number of Doors classics, and is the band at their most psychelelic. Highly recommended to all fans of the great 60s band.
B00006IUL7|3.0|Christopher Nolan's 2002 remake of Insomina is sadly his weakest film in an otherwise impressive filmography. The main problem is the relentless softening and sentimentalising of the material: Pacino's cop is much more sociable and wise rather than the Skaarsgard's morally empty cold fish, and is consequently much less interesting. Nolan keeps Pacino's shouty moments to a minimum and he does a much more impressive job of the sleep deprivation, but the audience-friendly characterization results in a clich?d stereotype on a predictable journey to inevitable redemption.     Sadly, the dilution doesn't end with Pacino but runs throughout the film. In this version - for those familiar with the original - the dog is already dead to avoid anything that might alienate us from the hero, the women are mostly father confessor figures, the hotel receptionist IS polite to the shot man, there's no kitten scene, Hilary Swank is saddled with a horrible \\"I know you're a good cop even if you don't\\" scene that lacks the cold condemnation and loss of trust of the original's finale and, most damagingly, it's strongly implied that the girl's murder was not accidental, which draws a line between cop and killer. A couple of key scenes are badly directed, most notably the shooting in the fog that highlights Nolan's problems with action scenes (although there is one good chase over logs in the river).     There are, however, strong points, mostly once Robin Williams enters the scene. The film does briefly address the complicity between cop and killer and takes interesting detours from the original, but it's still a film that works for a couple of reels at a time then goes off the boil for another couple of reels before staging another recovery.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|This was one of the greatest, creepiest movies I have seen in a very long time. I was amazed by the way Christian Bale literally destroyed himself for this role. His performance is unforgetable and will leave you stunned.<br /><br /> Christian Bale plays the insomniac Trevor Reznik, who has not slept in a year. Trevor has forgotten why he has trouble sleeping and starts to doubt his sanity when he meets a co-worker that he has never seen before and no one else seems to see. Trevor works in a machine shop with very dangerous equipment. His work place becomes even more dangerous as he continues to see this co-worker and continues not to sleep. Determined to find out more about this man, Trevor goes to the extremes. The more he tries to find out about this co-worker the more he starts to remember what caused his insomnia.<br /><br />This movie will keep you guessing until the very end. Having seen many movies like this one, I have gotten pretty good at figuring out what is going to happen in the end, but not with this film. Once I thought I had this movie figured out, but it kept taking unexpected turns and I had no idea what was going to happen. I could never tell if the co-worker or series of events taking place were really happening or hallucinations that Reznik had due to his insomnia. The finale is unexpected and shocking. It is very difficult for me to find a scary thriller movie that I like... and this one blew me away. I highly recommend it!
0156027321|5.0|I read this entire book thinking that this was the actual autobiography of Pi!  In other words, I thought this was a TRUE story!  Some of you are probably thinking that this reviewer is not the sharpest knife in the drawer but who on earth could make something like this up?  Think about it.....this story is so illogical that it has to be true.  The attention to detail that the author, Yann Martel inserts into this novel is unbelievable.  I guess this is why some people are brilliant authors and some of us are just readers! I read this book as entertainment.....I rarely look for metaphors or allegories or hidden meanings; I did that in high school and college.  But occasionally, someone will write something that is so gripping, it is all you can think about.  If I had reviewed the LIFE OF PI immediately after reading it, I probably would have given it 4 stars.  But now, months later, I keep picking up the story and thumbing through it, thinking about it, savoring it.  So, I figured this is a Five Star book.    Pi is a young Indian boy who, much to his parent's chagrin, is not quite sure what religion he wants to be; so, he practices his native Hindu, Christianity and Islam as well.  It is quite comical reading about his devotion to these religions; it's as if he wants to have all his bases covered.  Another thing Pi is passionate about is his father's zoo.  He spends his free time with the animals and tries to learn everything he can, both through observation and by his father's numerous lectures.  This education will serve him well when he starts on his long journey in the small lifeboat.    Pi and his family board a ship for immigration to Canada. While at sea, the ship sinks, killing all on board with the exception of Pi. He survives by jumping into a lifeboat with a hyena, and is joined by a Zebra with a broken leg, a fierce Bengal tiger and an orangutan. Eventually only the tiger (Richard Parker) and the boy survive. Months at sea are spent trying to stay out ofthe tiger's way, finding food, water, cleaning animal excrement and trying to stay dry. He even tries to tame this animal.  There were also storms to contend with.  It was absolutely fascinating to read this account of the day-to-day, hour by hour (sometimes), activities on the high sea.  This is quite a brilliant and compelling novel and I'm not being trite when I say I couldn't put it down.  People have compared Martel to Margaret Atwood and I agree that this is a fair and complimentary assessment.
B000002U9W|3.0|Before they became fabulously rich with their \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" album, Pink Floyd released a series of somewhat erratic records. In a better world, Capitol Records would release an anthology of the best pieces, but that isn't about to happen anytime soon. So, if you'd like to hear what Pink Floyd were doing before their major breakthrough, you're going to have to buy several of their CDs. <br /> <br />The title suite of \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is among the strangest - and best - of the band's pre-Dark Side material. It's an instrumental collaboration between the band and composer Ron Geesin, an attempt to wed Pink Floyd's spaced-out blues to an avant-garde classical structure. The result? Pink Floyd themselves pop in and out of the piece, performing in a style very similar to the way they played on \\"Echoes\\" and Geesin gives us some truly strange choral and French horn arrangements. It's atmospheric at times, but in a good way, and much of the suite could pass for the soundtrack of a late 1960s science-fiction movie like \\"2001\\" or \\"Planet of the Apes.\\" If that sounds like fun to you, then seek out this CD. To be honest, this is one of my favorite Pink Floyd pieces even though the band supposedly hates it. <br /> <br />The remainder of the CD is weak, \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" is a sound-effects collage that will probably be of minimal interest to anyone. \\"If\\" is an underdeveloped Roger Waters song, and typical of Floyd's attempts to create a more mellow, mainstream ballad sound. \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is one of David Gilmour's favorite compositions, and also the CD's only high point after the title track. At this point Gilmour hadn't yet achieved the technical breakthroughs that made him a major guitar hero of the 1970s, and mostly contributed pretty and evocative textures to the title track. However, Gilmour lets loose with \\"Fat Old Sun\\" and gives us a glimpse at what he was about to become. It's a pleasure and a delight to hear Gilmour on this Beatlesque tune. <br /><br />Given that almost all of Pink Floyd's early albums are of roughly equal quality, I would recommend this one as a purchase if you're fond of early 1970s attempts to wed classical and rock music. If you're forewarned that this CD isn't going to rival Floyd's later work, I think you'll find that the title suite and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" hold up very well to repeated listenings, especially through headphones.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|I can't beleive all these stellar reviews about this new album and the recent shows.Take a Breath rocked and echoes was [...] but the rest of the show was extremely tired only to be surpassed by the new Lawrence Welk inspired album On an Island.Folks this is David Gilmour i'm talking about here.you know,the ripping guitar player,is this what his wife has turned him into,how in the world does he actually think this is his best work yet ,like you keep reading about!!He said in guitar player mag. that he was done with Floyd:been there done that\\"when he was asked about hooking up with roger for a new tour,well if your so tired of your bread and butter,Pink Floyd,then why are you spending more than half of your live show playing that very same music Dave?I can't believe your not playing any tunes off your first 2 albums,which both have a bunch of rocking songs?What's up with that?I think he said,well everyone expect's me to play a bunch of Floyd.Well it's pretty rare for you to go around touring as David Gilmour to not even play anything off those first 2 lp's,which sucked.All of these people that expct to keep hearing floyd tunes should have gone to all of the shows you did with floyd inthe 80's and90's,I went,at the oakland coluseum outside and the arena next door, every time,and they were some of the most memorable shows i was ever at,thanks dave,but I also went and saw him at Berkeleys Greek theater as david gilmour and that show was one of my and my friends'favorite shows of all and we've seen everyone who ever rocked that came to the bay area.Ihave a suspiscion that these people that give 5 stars to this new sleeper cd are the same people that lock they're car for the 30 seconds when they run into the post office,or keep they're blinker on when they're well back in the line at a left turn signal for 5 minutes. Oh well,what're ya gonna do,I hope dave'll put out some more rockin stuff at some point,man if he was gonna play all that Floyd,how bout some Animals,all right i'm wore out see ya!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I know that this album wasnt that well received, but that probably is because no-one gives Madonna a chance anymore...they judge her on her perceived persona. To put it simply, this CD is awesome. The title track, both funny and strange, works well even with her stab at rapping. \\"Hollywood\\" is one of her greatest tracks...ever. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is inspiring and provoking, a classic. The production by Mirwais is crisp and hard-edged....perfect for the songs. Madonna reveals so much of her self in \\"Mother and Father\\" (about her childhood and repressed rage) or \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" (about living under the crushing spotlight of public expectations). The only fault I have with it is \\"Easy Ride\\", which kind of goes nowhere. Still, a classic.
B00003CXDG|1.0|This has be one of the worst movies ever made. The prolonged slow motion fighting scenes, the sentimental music, the pathetic apperance of Anthony Hopkins playing the cliched older wise man. All these things combined produce strong vomit reflexes in my gut. When Tom Cruise and his enemy charge at each other as in a joust on motorcycles and then leap off them to land on top of each other the unintentional guy on guy action oozes all over the screen. And when the movie ends with children carrying baloons i know that i have wasted precious timw with this garbage.unfortunatley metallica sells out and lends their music to this dud.
B000000WA4|5.0|i pity anyone who associates this album with nirvana or the grunge scene. i don't know why anyone can't call music rock n roll anymore. i mean... whatever happened to that?? anyway... yes this album deserves 5 stars, i mean it's pretty self-explanatory when you listen to it. some of my favorite songs (and i haven't seen anyone list these as favorites, i don't know why)are: bodies, where boys fear to tread, and thru the eyes of ruby. these are the most upbeat and heavy... but yeah.. overall.. a kick ass album!
B00005JOWR|4.0|Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is perhaps the most detested man in America.  As a smoking lobbyist, he must put a good face on the hated and waning tobacco market.  He is savvy and smart, making appearances on news interviews and daytime talk shows.  He creates spin in the cleverest ways.  (For instance, he must address a panel on \\"The Joan Lunden Show\\" and face an-ex smoker, a child who is dying from cancer.  He says that they don't want people to die of cancer because they would lose their customers, and he only recommends cigarettes when they are grown up.)  He must lobby \\"to pay the mortgage,\\" but he also must keep his son's respect.  Eventually, like many others, his son is caught up in the spin of his father's saviness.  He learns to become as persuasive as his father. Yet, for Nick, persuasion is still a challenge: He must stand up to a back-stabbing boss and his two partners in crime, one (Maria Bello) the alcohol advocate, and one for firearms.  Although his biggest nemesis is the senator of Vermont (William Macy), a pompous politician whose attempts to squash Naylor seem futile.  His second biggest contender is a beautiful reporter who exposes him when he is oddly vulnerable.    Based on a Christopher Buckley novel, \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is a satire that hits the right delivery.  It is not subtle, but it doesn't really become self-righteous.  The movie is funny, yet obvious, without beating the viewer over the head.  Sometimes the tension of the plot wains, but it is seldom unengaging.  The performances are good--especially Aaron Eckhart as the smooth, conniving Naylor.  It should be said that the previews are excellent, but they do give away too many of the punchlines.  (For those who are uninitiated, plug your ears if they start to show this film before you see it.)  For others who are sensitive, there is a great deal of profanity and a sex scene (which does make a point, by the way) that may deter some away.  Overall, it is a solid comedy with fine portrayals and enough punches to go around (politics, entertainment, and the tobacco industry).
B0000AQS0F|1.0|What can I say?  If you thought Buffy was Holy Writ, you'll fall right in line with the other apologists of anything Josh.  I, however, think its generic new-age psychobabble poorly disguised in a mixed-genre borefest.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|Yep.  Pharma companies are evil.  Got it.  Good acting, but I looked at the timer on the DVD player about 1:07 into the movie and was ready for this to be over.

0385504209|4.0|I wish to state that I probably have never read a book that more signifies the cliche \\"can't put it down\\". Chapter after chapter hooked me, and I got in trouble more than once by spending time reading it instead of tending to \\"more important things\\". Not only does it do it with standard cliff-hanger-danger chapter-endings, but also is superb with revealing bits of information regarding religion and history that made me want to hang in there and see where it was leading.<br /><br />I am a Roman Catholic who takes his children to church every week. I was raised in the religion, and believe that SOMETHING big must have happened 2000 years ago for so many people to write and die for this cause (on the other hand, folks are doing this today and I don't agree with them). I love the simplicity of the message of Jesus Christ, and think that the BASIC tenets are pretty darn good things to live by.<br /><br />But I'm also aware that \\"da rules\\" of the Church and the stories we hear are very possibly not 100% the way things actually happened. I am aware that the \\"official\\" version we have today is what was pieced together by people several hundred years after the life of Christ. I'm also willing to believe that writings that did not fit into a desired mold may have been excluded and destroyed.<br /><br />I am also very aware that the 50% of the population that can actually grow life and give birth have been treated very shabbily throughout history. Even today women cannot be priests, and hold no power in the Catholic structure. I would not be less faithful if women could be priests, Mary was not a virgin mother, and Mary Magdalene the love of Jesus. This book raises these questions.<br /><br />It also raises a very interesting discussion. Just WHAT IF the real Jesus Christ had a healthy male-female loving relationship with Mary Magdalene? What if she, in essence, was Jesus' girlfriend? What would God now be thinking of his creation (i.e., us) over the last, oh, 1700 years, to see that his \\"official\\" church was recording the love of his life as a common hooker? Very, very powerful stuff to think about.<br /><br />I love this book because it makes one think about these things, things I don't think make you less of a religious person for at least wanting to discuss it. But in my opinion, the book sets itself up way too high, and can't find an ending worthy of the build-up.<br /><br />The build-up we are given deserves no less. Thus, four stars instead of five.ears, to see that his \\"official\\" church was recording the love of his life as a common hooker?

B00000055E|5.0|I read some review where people said it was rushed. Tupac wrote these songs before he died. These songs were never altered, sold, poluted, or reprised by any other producer/artist. Eminem never got a chance to add his voice or 50 cent's to a song or album. I believed it was somewhat of a cry from the grave, or in a sense final words to poets and fans alike, who could benifet from his wisdom. This album is not be appreciated for its abilty to entertain a club or crowd. And not all rap albums arent supposed to. I believe this album to be the true voice of Tupac after his grave. It is familier of his \\"Me Against the World\\" album. I urger anyone who is looking for a cd to bump in their car, play at a party or while cleaning their house TO NOT BUY THUS ALBUM, But anyone who wants to know what Tupacs real future for his music to do so! Please lets not poision his legacy lets uphold it.
B000002B2T|5.0|Yes, this album lacks the virtuousity of Jerry Cantrell's guitar mastery, but after many years I just listened again with new ears and heard the AMAZING soul contained in this one chance collabaration.      It is on par with Temple of the Dog in my opinion, but different... simpler.  It has a sound reminiscent of an old blues album, full of angst and sorrow, with a fair amount of quiet space separating mournfully fuzzy surging guitars rhythyms and vocals, leaving ample room to ponder regrets and losses.      The pop contribution of the ballad River of Deceit in the context of surrounding material actually becomes welcome relief to the heavy thoughts accumulated elsewhere on this rather gloomy yet soulful album.    The legendary Skerik supplies his trademark soulful sax and steel drums, making for a masterful entourage that includes Pearl Jam rhythm guitarist Mike Mcready among others.     ABOVE really highlights the life and talents of Layne Staley, perhaps better than any other album I can think of, probably due to the fact that Cantrell is not present to distract from Layne's amazing vibrato and the deafing silence surrounding his dark presence.  The video is definitely worth having, even if only available on VHS.    While perhaps not a technical or lyrical apogee for the artists involved, it is distinctly unique and worthy of a few uncritical listens before a rush to judgement.  I often feel as if it is mood music for a very private wake.  It is a piece of tragic rock history, and it works for me.    A great album for Staley or Skerik fans (Skerik aka Nalgas sin Carne), for SAP or Jar of Flies fans, for blues/rock/grunge fans, for singing along with, for going to sleep to, or for feeling like somebody out there might have it as bad or worse than yourself.      Sweet dreams, Layne.
0099664313|4.0|This is the fourth in a series of what has been, until now, exceptionally well written time travel, adventure/romance books by the author. There are six such books published to date in the series. Those of us who are hopelessly addicted to this series are hoping for a seventh.<br /><br />I urge the reader to start at the beginning and read each and every one in the order in which it was written. Be not afraid of the length of each book. Trust me when I say that you will end up wishing that they were each longer, so riveting is the story that the author unfolds. Ms. Gabaldon is a master storyteller without compare, employing the superlative use of actual historical events with authentic period detail to weave a three dimensional tapestry of timeless love and adventure. While the core of the story is about a love that transcends time, it is an adventure story that holds the reader in its thrall.<br /><br />The love that spans time is that which twentieth century Englishwoman, Claire Randall, has for eighteenth century Scottish highlands warrior, James Fraser. Those readers who have read the first book in the series, \\"Outlander\\", know that in 1945, Claire, a combat nurse during World War II, is reunited with her husband, Frank, after the war. While on a second honeymoon in Scotland, she visits a strange, flat topped hill, where a forbidding stone circle draws her. Touching one of the stones, she is hurled through a vortex in time and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland, where she meets the brave and brawny, red headed Scot, James Fraser, with whom she falls head over heels in love. Finding herself thrust into the midst of clan warfare and intrigue, she and her beloved 'Jamie' have enough adventures to last a lifetime.<br /><br />The second book, \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\", is a continuation of that story, told from the perspective of the twentieth century where Claire, now a doctor, has lived for the past twenty years. Upon the death of her twentieth century husband, Frank, Claire returns to Scotland with her grown, red headed daughter, Brianna. There she discloses to Brianna the events of her secret past, as well as the truth as to who Brianna's biological father truly is and of the love that Claire bore him.<br /><br />While in Scotland, however, Claire discovers something that will change her future, as well as her past. You see, for the past twenty years Claire has mistakenly believed that her beloved 'Jamie' died in the historic battle of Culloden. It was there that the Scottish highlanders bravely fought the English in a misguided attempt to restore Charles Stuart, their bonnie Prince Charlie, to the English throne, only to be decimated on the battlefield. Those few who survived were branded as Jacobite traitors and imprisoned, and their families disenfranchised. It was this very event that Claire and 'Jamie' had conspired to change, only to fail.<br /><br />Their story transports the reader from the turmoil of the Scottish highlands to the intrigue of the French Court and regales the reader with the adventures of the two lovers, as they conspire to change the very course of history. It was this valiant attempt that ultimately brought Claire and 'Jamie' to the crossroad that would compel these star crossed lovers to part and have Brianna become a denizen of the twentieth century.<br /><br />In \\"Voyager\\", Claire, now realizing that the love of her life and soulmate survived the battle of Culloden, makes the decision to go back in time and find James Fraser, as she has not stopped loving or wanting him every waking moment for the past twenty years. Leaving her daughter, Brianna, she once more hurls herself into the vortex of time to eighteenth century Scotland to begin her search for James Fraser, inhopes of being reunited with her 'Jamie'.<br /><br />\\"Voyager\\" tells the story of what happened to Claire Randall and James Fraser in those intervening years. It tells of their ultimate reunion and rediscovery. Against a backdrop of historical events and period detail and with a cast of unforgettable characters, it regales the reader with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland. Reunited with Jamie, none the worse for wear, they seek to make a life for themselves. As their love comes full circle, they take to the high seas, and their adventures continue, captivating the reader once more.<br /><br />In \\"Drums of Autumn\\", the story takes somewhat of a detour, as it begins to focus more on Brianna. Back in the twentieth century, Brianna and her boyfriend, Roger, a Scot and college history professor, as well as descendant of one of James Fraser's cousins from clan MacKenzie, each independently make a discovery that stuns them. Roger keeps it to himself, while Brianna acts upon it. The discovery involves an old news clipping which tells of Claire's and James' premature deaths in a house fire in pre-revolutionary, frontier America. Brianna makes the decision to go to the stone circle to try and go back in time to change the course of history and save her parents. She does not, however, tell Roger of her plans. Roger, discovering Brianna's deception, follows on her heels and, on that strange, flat topped hill in Scotland he, too, enters the stone circle and is himself hurled into the vortex of time.<br /><br />Brianna and Roger catch up with each other in the eighteenth century only to be parted for a time, each having their own adventures. Claire and James by now are established homesteaders in North Carolina and are enjoying, what is for them, a relatively staid life. By the time Brianna catches up with them, an event has occurred in her life which may have the impact of forcing her to stay mired in the past.<br /><br />This fourth book in the series is a bit of a disappointment, as it could have used some serious editing due to the author's self-indulgence. Moreover, the characters are not so well drawn, as they are in the first three books in the series. Unfortunately, a pivotal character, that of Brianna, is uncharismatic and comes across as somewhat vapid and stupid. Brianna definitely needs work, if she is to capture the readers' imagination, as have Claire and 'Jamie'. At the stage of development in which she is, Brianna would be unable to sustain another book. The same goes for Roger, who comes across as somewhat one dimensional, though he does have potential, as he seems to have a latent smoldering and sensual quality to his personality.<br /><br />Still, notwithstanding some of these issues, this remains a compelling time travel saga, one which the many fans of this series will, undoubtedly, enjoy.op of historical events and period detail and with a cast of unforgettable characters, it regales the reader with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland.

015603252X|3.0|I liked the story of Amos Oz's life, but I was hoping for more colour on his teenage and young adult years and less on his young boy days.  I would recommend this as a story on Amos Oz but not as a story of Israel's history - - which is how the book is marketed.
B0007SN89A|4.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" was the last album The Beatles recorded as a group, though the \\"Let It Be\\" album was the last recording they released. This was certainly the end of an era, and none of The Beatles would go on to match the success that they had enjoyed collectively as one of the most imaginative, talented, and successful groups ever to grace the music industry.<br /><br />\\"Abbey Road\\" is an excellent recording. Interestingly enough, one of the best tracks on the album, and certainly his best effort, is George Harrison's \\"Something\\". This album has many good songs from which the listener may choose, however, and the tracks on it are as diverse in feeling as The Beatles themselves. The reality is that this album remains best known for the fact that this would be the last recording by The Beatles. As such, no music collection should be without it.
B00000JR29|4.0|If you like this band, this is the release that will most familiar to most as it was its best selling sophomore release as well as one of 1983's best sellers period. It was remastered in 2001 with additional cuts as well as US mixes of 2 hit singles, the massive hit Shout as well as the lesser ranking Mothers Talk.<br /><br />This is a hard review as the original release was perfect so who could argue with a decent remastering job? Especially is you are replacing a cassette or a CD purchased in the 1980a that has probably seen better days. So if either of the above apply, I would do it without a doubt. If you are not interested in their individual releases, and want their greatest hits you should stick to Shout: The Very Best Of Tears For Fears, which was also released in 2001<br /><br />My main (yet workable) qualm with this remastered release is the that it highlights that it has bonus tracks (which hard-core fans usually year for in principle), and with the exception of being able to hear the differences between the album versus US single cuts of Shout and Mothers talk, all the other bonus cuts make it clear that they should have remained in the vaults.<br /><br />I wish that had included some worthy B-sides, dance/extended remixes, as they did in ther brilliant rerelease of The Hurting, instead of what sound like working sessions/dubs of the main body of the release. The liner notes highlight that some did not think that the release, which only had 8 cuts did not constitute a full album and that those dissenters would be pleased to know that this release now had double the number of cuts.<br /><br />My response to those comments are as follows:<br /><br />To the critics: 8 great cuts beat some of the navel gazing artists who max. out a CDs running time just to give the impession that more means better, or even wrose put out 2 CD releases without any merit.<br /><br />To the writer of the liner notes and team behind this release. First, 15 cuts is less than 16 so while nit picking the number of cuts has not been doubled. The real problem, as highlighted above is that cuts 9-13 are true fillers.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I purchased this CD and made my own 5 star mix by recording the 8 original cuts (now remastered) and added cuts 14 and 15. The extraction of cuts 9-13 is essential unless you want to keep pressing for next song.<br /><br />I am a huge TFT fan and would recommend that any fan buy this collection, as long as they are not doing so due to the belief (those marketing knuckle heads) that they will be getting some unreleased gems. If money is tight and you already have the original CD, stick with that and save your money to consider purchashing their Ultimate Collection 3 CD release (2 CDs plus ! Bonus), which covers all their best, including great songs released when the group's popularity went down. It's not cheap but it has almost all the songs that any true fan would want. Not all, but pretty darn close.<br /><br />Thanks again to all of you for keeping this forum relevant and for your kind notes.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|This has easily become my children's (and my) favorite show -- and mind you they are 4 and 2!  We have the movie soundtrack too.  My 4 yo DD pretends to be Christine all the time! <br /> <br />I think all of the casting/singing was perfect.  I personally like it better than the broadway version, which amazes me. <br /> <br />It's definately one of those movies that I can see over and over and NEVER get sick of.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|So everybody says the same thing about Panic! at the Disco sounding exactly like Fall Out Boy, and I admit after listening to it the singers voices are very similar, but you can hardly call them the same thing. My friend forced me to listen to \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\" and I immediately fell in love with it. The lyrics are well written, and the way they are phrased throughout the song drew me in--it was so different! So I bought the album and in no way was I disappointed. Their sound is unique and it is not a FOB ripoff. Every track is great; I can't stop playing it!<br /><br />Top five songs:<br /><br />1)Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off<br /><br />2)Build God, then we'll talk<br /><br />3)The only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage<br /><br />4)I constantly thank God for Esteban<br /><br />5)There's a good reason these tables are numbered honey, you just haven't thought of it yet

I mean, come on, who doesn't want to read a book where he pretends to choke on food in order to have people save his life, as well as work a far-less that mediocre job in a colonial town... oh and go to sex a holic meetings... get over it this book rocks.

B00005JOYA|4.0|Great special effects. Stayed pretty close to the game. The best part was when this bull-dyke cop gets beaten with steel pipes and then burned alive (at the stake, sort of).  <br /> <br />All in all I'd recommend it and will go see the sequel when it comes out.
1560234806|4.0|Minority Report is one of those rare films that really does incite thought. Strongly philosophical, political and sociological it deals with a variety of complex issues that the majority of Hollywood films shy away from, e.g. determinism, justice and authority. It's also highly entertaining and superbly acted, with, as you might expect, first rate direction. The plot is fast paced, gripping, fluent, and avoids becoming episodic or didactic as many Sci-Fi films are. Whilst the action scenes are nothing special, they do keep you absorbed and are not overdone.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise are both at their best in this highly rewarding movie, definitely a good buy.
0670034711|3.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's \\"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,\\" chronicled her journey in three countries to basically \\"find herself.\\" After her nasty divorce and breakup with her then boyfriend, Liz, decided to take a break and get away from her normal and busy life. She decided to learn the Italian language in Rome, practice meditation and yoga in India and to balance the equilibrium of both spiritual and pleasure in Bali, Indonesia.  <br /> <br />I felt that this book dealt more with the author's personal journey as oppose to a typical travelogue. She presented more personal information about herself than about the places she travelled, which was fine. It was actually good as I felt that I knew the author personally. In addition, the writing was good; clear and concise but somehow I was not drawn to her book. I felt that her journey and the events were too \\"contrived\\" or rather \\"pre-planned.\\" In any case, this was a better than average travel/self-discovery book and I would recommend this for anyone who wants to learn more about the Italian language, meditation as well as the Balinese culture.
B00005B36H|3.0|BEFORE you go and think that I am crazy or unappricative of Tools efforts because I didnt rank this higher, please read on so that I can explain my reasons that \\"Lateralus\\" just isn't a masterpiece by Tool. If we trace back to the earlier days of Tool, \\"Opiete\\" and \\"Undertow\\" were both kick ass and right up in your face music. And then the masterpiece \\"Anemia\\" was released, and every single track on the album f**ked with your mind, and took your into another world that only Tool could take you to! SO here we are waiting, waiting, waiting for the newest Tool release (of course I am refering to a few years ago when we all were highly anticipating Tools \\"Lateralus\\" WELL as it seems most fans and reviewers (espically on this site) took it as a brillent masterpiece, and I look at it almost falling as a disaterpiece. First off, the album is no where near the intensity or feel of the previous albums, and it seemed that on each Tool release, each album built a little more and more on the insanity, and just when I thought that this was the album that was going to blow my Fu**king mind.....Fizzzzzzz.....I was very dispointed, and I dont understand what all the praise is about. Sure there are some good songs on here, and maybe Tool was trying to experiment a little more on the mellower, more techincal side of things, but for me, it just doesnt work. The lyrical content is no where near \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Anemia\\" and even though the album took along time to complete, it seems that Maynard James Keenan had has mind more involved with A Pefect Circle, since I think their debut blows this album out of the water! I will rate this higher then I would like, since the few good songs, really kick some ass, but there a just a few, and the rest seems like filler. They could have left us with something much better to go out with, but then again there is Always A PEFECT CIRCLE...
B000028U0Y|5.0|[vary the star rating, depending on whether you like the music or not ...] <br /> <br />A couple of points about this record (yes, I'm old enough to remember LP's, a necessary qualification for assessing Johnny Cash, who whatever he may have been, was not a teenybopper]: <br /> <br />1) the crowd-of-prisoner noises, including the celebrated roar that went up after the line \\"I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die\\", are dubbed in, <br /> <br />2) not only did he not shoot a man in Reno (or W Va. or NYC or anywhere else) but he did NOT do time, anywhere. <br /> <br />Quite a myth (in the sense of the real truth not being the important truth) built up around this guy. Partly the aura he created, like any artist (more of a performance artist, than a poet, I would say), partly the need of an intellectually and emotionally splitting society to have some sort of hero acceptable to a multiplicity of classes and types. If he's valid for you, great, just don't accept anything at face value. After all, this is America, a nation of embusteros.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|This film is disturbing to watch but has POWERFUL lessons for us all.     It was sad how much the two main characters had to hide the love they found.  I believe if some is gay deep inside they cannot pretend to be somebody else.  Pretending to be someone else is more harmful than helpful, and they end up suffering more.    Society is still scared to death of people who are \\"too different.\\"   What a powerful lesson this film teaches.  Even Dora should understand that her so called Christian moralizing does not match up with the truth exuding from this award winning film.    Until human beings are able to understand people who are different rather than hurting them, we are still running in place.   We have a ways to go.     It's all about tolerance the Golden Rule...treat others like you would like to be treated.  You should know this if you are a 5th grader or a senior citizen.  The ethic of reciprocity (or the Golden Rule) is a general moral principle found in virtually all religions and culture, often as a fundamental rule, a fact which suggests that it may be related to innate aspects of human nature (see altruism). It is most commonly rendered as \\"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\\", or in other words \\"treat others as you want to be treated\\".    In most formulations it takes a passive form, as expressed by the Jewish sage Hillel: \\"What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man.\\"   In Western culture, however, the most famous formulation is active, as expressed in the Torah as \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" (Leviticus 19:18).   This traditional guiding rule was (and is) so highly valued that it has for centuries been known in English as the \\"Golden Rule\\".      Congrats on those who had the guts and integrity to make this picture.  I hope it starts and long and healthy dialogue about tolerance and love.  This country needs good political dialogues so desperately.  We need more respect for each others' humanity.

The ending was a surprise and was pretty creepy.She is beautiful, writes her own songs, plays just about every musical instrument on her albums and possesses a truly exquisite voice.

B000EBFMYO|5.0|When Primal Scream followed \\"Screamadelica\\" with (the completely underated) \\"Give Out But Don't Give Up it\\" it was generally considered to be too massive a change of direction. Riot City Blues dwarfs even that as a radical departure, but fortunately this time there can be absolutely no denying that the move is 100% successful. The album is their most cohesive yet and is the best, uncomplicated, euphoric, party record made for years and years. It's the record they should have made when Mani first joined (a stunning free transfer comparable to Ronnie Wood joining The Stones - can you imagine The Scream without Mani?) and features songs that will blow the roof off any venue when played live; \\"Country Girl\\", \\"The 99th Floor\\" and \\"Hell's Coming Down\\" sound like an unholey union of The Pogues, Clash, Stones and Stooges (fighting in a drunken hoare house), \\"Little Death\\" is sex between Jim Morrison and John Cale, and \\"Sometimes I Feel So Lonely\\" keeps all the Bobby-G-in-Fragile-Epic fans happy, what a gorgeous song. Anyway, RCBs is just fantastic and as a life long fan I'm over the moon. Bobby and Mani have been telling anyone that they are the best rock 'n' roll band in the world - now they've got the album to back the statement up. Buy it and TURN IT UP.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I saw this movie maybe 5 years ago and one day I just thought to myself, I haven't seen it on television anymore, not even on non premium cable channels. The effects and scenery were completely out of this world. It was an adventurous, fun and touching film that wasn't given the attenton and props it deserved. If you have never seen it and you have a home theater system, oh man, you must have this movie because it will blow you away.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|3.5 stars.  I know I'm going to be beat up by Ms. Keys fans, and from what I seen of Alicia in interviews and everything, I agree she has talent.  But I've failed to be completely 'wowed' by her.  I keep waiting.  She's come close a couple of times but so far no dice.  Don't get me wrong there are a ccouple of descent songs.  \\"You don't know my name\\", for one and I'm amazed she won five grammys with this effort, but that just goes to show you that there are different strokes for different folks. Overall: Just okay.

Now, Jordan can moo, buzz, pop, and klop with the best of them! It's a very fun book that's not too long to read and holds their attention from beginning to end!
1400079179|5.0|To begin with, there are no lulls in this book. It is perfectly paced and does so with great effect. After the first 50 pages I felt that I knew what was going to happen but I was entirely wrong. I had purposefully stayed away from news stories about this book so that I would encounter it fresh and unbiased. The result is that its the best novel Ive read in the past few years. It covers the most coveted and revered stories from our childhood, when we are taught about Jesus and the New Testament and all that it involves. I was guessing at many times in the book and, a few times, I guessed right. For the most part, however, I was wrong or had no idea and finding the answers with the characters was like being along for a grand adventure. Well written, constructed and paced, it has solid characters, and a thrilling storyline. Highly recommended.
B000957O82|3.0|HITCH [2005]<br /><br />  \\"Hitch\\" is a romantic comedy about Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens [Will Smith], a \\"date doctor\\" that is trying to get hopeless romantic Albert [Kevin James] the woman of his dreams, Allegra Coles. But Hitch himself has fallen in love with Sara [Eva Mendes]! Oh no!<br /><br />  The movie is constantly switching between Hitch's relationship and Albert's relationship, which is a big disappointment. Why? Because all of Kevin James' scenes are great and funny, while Will Smith's scenes are very boring. Smith and James play their parts almost perfectly, but I guess James just got better lines.<br /><br />  I mean, take a look at the \\"Hitch\\" commercials they played in 2005. Almost all the scenes they played was from Kevin James. BECAUSE HE STEALS THE SHOW! When James is in the dancing scene, it's hilarious. When Smith is teaching James how to kiss, it's hilarious. But when Smith is throwing a salad or whatever at Eva Mandez, it's not...<br /><br />  The movie seems to drag on and on and on. It is about 2 hours long and about half of it is worthless crap that I didn't care about. Shoulda cut it down to an hour and a half and only had a half hour of Hitch's relationship!<br /><br />  For the laughs you do get, I woulda gave Hitch 4.5 out of 5 or something like that. But the boring parts just make it a little... well... boring! The only standout Will Smith scene is the \\"speed dating\\" scene, and that doesn't save the movie.<br /><br />*** out of *****<br /><br />Pros: Kevin James, \\"speed dating\\" scene<br /><br />Cons: just about everything else
B00005JLEU|1.0|I rented this film and forced my best friend to watch this with me after hearing all this fan faving on the film.  I'm open to new experiences.  In return, I got nothing.  This is the work of genius?  This is nothing but a strange and weird animation.  First clue to the reviewer that giving tips on how to watch this movie: a movie shouldn't need cliff notes.  Nothing, and I do mean nothing in this film makes one ioda of sense to me and I can't believe I'm wasting more time in posting a review this garbage.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|I wanted to see \\"Closer\\" because I love all the stars of the movie.  Also because it was directed by Mike Nichols who has done some very good movies.  I think I have to blame this on the editing because it was very hard to follow.  It is a movie that was very hard to understand and follow but it did have the good vs. evil plot on every person'a life.  It skipped around in time and place like it was just a random story about these four people and I really like a movie that has a definite beginning and end. I think you have to be a big fan of all the stars and the director to enjoy this movie, but I would not recommend it to everyone.
0375831002|5.0|I don't often read fiction because I find so much writing to be either contrived or predictable.  This is just GREAT writing. Many passages can stand on their own with deep meaning even out of context.  <br /> <br />Also the story seems to me to be much more about the manner in which things happen rather than just a sequence of events.  He does not often narrate about what the characters are thinking, rather he shows who they are by the many small things they do. <br /> <br />This is a book for adults more than children unless the children are \\"old\\". I am going to reread this at some point and get copies for several people. The Book Thief speaks strongly to the power of words to produce good and evil. Anyone interested in writing must read this book.

B00005JOEA|5.0|When I go to the movies, I don't expect to see a movie that will become one of my favorites, but V for Vendetta did just that.  This movie is great.  I've never read the graphic novel on which it is based so I don't know how true it is to it(or them?), but I do know this politically charged movie visits some valid points that are or could be problems in today's world.  Some people think it is too political, however, that is not what I got out of the movie.  This movie is a story of a government gone too far and the bonding of a nation to overcome tyranny.  Strong conservatives or otherwise close-minded people may not enjoy this movie (hence the very few bad ratings on this site), but as long as you go in with an open-mind, this movie shouldn't bother you, and you may find a new favorite movie of your own.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy appeared on Sunday nights on ABC as a mid-season replacement, following the highly-successful Desperate Housewives. By the time the nine-episode first season was finished, it was one of the highest-rated shows on television and it had bumped Boston Legal from the time slot.<br /><br />This two-disc set captures all nine of the first season episodes with a number of special features thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Grey's Anatomy focuses on surgical resident Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her fellow doctors and residents at Seattle Grace Hospital. Meredith is the daughter of one of the most famous female surgeons in history, Ellis Grey, putting a lot of pressure on Meredith. Adding to that pressure is the fact that Ellis is now suffering from Alzheimers and Meredith is struggling to keep that information from her mother's former colleagues. Even more complications arise for Meredith in the pilot when she finds that the man she had a one-night stand with happens to be one of her supervisors, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). This relationship is the key ingredient in the first season of the show, as Meredith at first tries to get rid of the feelings, then embraces them, only to be slammed with a huge surprise in the final minutes of the season.<br /><br />Pompeo also provides the voice overs for the show, which at times can be rather overbearing, but can also provide just the right mood to establish where the show is coming from. Her character is not the most popular person on television because of the whining, but I think Pompeo does a great job as Meredith, someone obviously dealing with a lot of issues in her life.<br /><br />Dempsey is also fantastic as Dr. Shepherd, or as Meredith's friends like to call him, Dr. McDreamy. This was a career-reviving role for Dempsey and he nails it perfectly and he gets to provide the biggest surprise of the season as the final episode comes to a close.<br /><br />Sandra Oh stars at Cristina Yang, the gung-ho resident who sometimes goes a little too far with trying to get the best cases. It is obvious she is a gifted surgeon, but her bedside manner is far from stellar. She comes across as cold and uncaring at times, but viewers do get to see other sides of her. She enters a relationship with a superior, Dr. Preston Burke (Isiah Washington) midway through the season, and that relationship has carried on into season two.<br /><br />Washington is solid as Dr. Burke. Like Cristina, he is very driven and focused on his work. He has had precious little time for a personal life, which is possibly why he finds Cristina so appealing, as she seems to be just like him.<br /><br />T.R. Knight's George O'Malley, is my favorite character on the show. He has a huge crush on Meredith, but can't bring himself to tell her. He is a sweet guy, and a good doctor, but his bumbling ways make him appear unsure of himself, especially around women, particularly Meredith. You feel good for George when he goes out with a cute nurse who really likes him, but it comes back to bite him, as he contracts a venereal disease that is spreading through the hospital.<br /><br />Justin Chambers was added to the cast late as Dr. Alex Karev. Like Cristina, he has very poor bedside manner, but is cocky as all hell when it comes to his surgical skills. He tends to push other people aside and do what he thinks is right, even if other people offer better solutions.<br /><br />Roswell veteran Katherine Heigl stars as Dr. Izzie Stevens. She paid her way through med school as a model and has to deal with the repercussions of that when Alex finds a magazine spread and posts the photos throughout the hospital. She came from humble beginnings and made herself what she is, which makes her a very likeable character.<br /><br />James Pickens Jr. stars as Chief of Surgery Richard Webber, the man who oversees all the other doctors on the show. His failing eyesight becomes an issue late in the season, but basically in the first season, he just plays the leader. He gets a much-expanded role in the start of season two, when a former relationship between he and Meredith's mother is revealed.<br /><br />Chandra Bailey steals the show as Dr. Miranda Bailey, known as the Nazi. She is the supervisor for Meredith and her fellow interns and it is her job to make their days living hells. She obviously cares about the new doctors, but she is tough, not afraid to yell or get mad when the need arises.<br /><br />This set features two commentary tracks on the pilot, one from creator Shonda Rimes and director Peter Horton, the other from Heigl and Knight, with Oh joining in midway through. There are also a couple of featurettes and a look at a trailer in a foregn language, which is kind of cool.<br /><br />All in all, although this is a chick show, I enjoyed the set, much like I enjoy the show every Sunday night. It is truly addicting television., but basically in the first season, he just plays the leader.

B000EMGJM2|3.0|This was a good cd. His first cd blew me away though -- so it was hard to judge this one. His voice is so unique and calming. If this cd was done alone, I would have said 'o yes, this is hot'. But comparing to the first one? Its ok. My favorite songs are<br /><br />1:Being A Girl<br /><br />2:Hot Stage Lights<br /><br />3:Ride,Ride,Ride - thought i put the wrong song on my ipod lol, TOTALLY different, wow<br /><br />4:Priest of Police.<br /><br />Mean Sleep was definitely done better by Lenny Kravitz and Cree Summer :- . Van was good - Nikka (I LOVE her) but she just wasn't right for that song.
B00081U7HC|4.0|Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute.  This immensely popular, modern fairy tale romance is a fantastic \\"feel good\\" must see.  I watch it every single time it comes on TV; I just can't resist. To tempt you if you haven't seen it...it's the story of a feisty, good hearted hooker named Vivian Ward, who is hired for a week by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, to serve as his escort at a number of business related social functions. Needless to say, the relationship doesn't stay \\"just business\\" for long.<br /><br />As events unfold during the film, it becomes clear that, while Edward might not understand too clearly the meaning of \\"prostitution\\", Vivian clearly does. And, it's another shining film illustration of that pearl of wisdom from Eliza Doolittle (of My Fair Lady) who enlightened us, \\"The difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves, but how she is treated.\\" Or, in Vivian's own words, \\"People put you down enough, you start to believe it\\".<br /><br />Great Cinderella movie...don't miss it.
0743454537|5.0|Another reviewer wrote the following:  \\"But then, just as the reader is preparing for one of two or three possible, conceivable, endings, Picoult does something for which I cannot forgive her. She throws in an ending for which no one can be prepared and for which no one SHOULD be prepared. It was gratuitous, capricious, disjunctive, and entirely unnecessary. It will be a long long time before I ever pick up another Jodi Picoult book.\\"<br /><br />However, that is *exactlty* what I loved about the book!!!  It was one of those books where I kept thinking \\"OK, this is how it's gonna end...\\"  \\"No... THIS is how it's gonna end....\\"  \\"OMG, *THIS* is how it's gonna end...\\"<br /><br />And then the ending came... I *never* saw it coming.  I love books that keep me guessing - this one did.

B000002UC5|5.0|This album gets 5 stars because of Maybe I'm Amazed and I think it's worth buying just for this song!    I respect Paul for doing his own thing.. for trying to separate himself from The Beatles.. but that doesn't mean that his solo stuff was great... most of it is average... and I think  he kind of wanted it to be average (because I think he had motivational troubles)    On this album... it's pretty average... I mean it's nice but nothing stands out until (Drum role) Maybe I'm Amazed!!!!    It's almost like Maybe I'm Amazed comes out of no where and just rewards you.... it's Paul's greatest solo song.... I bet a bunch of people out there mistake it for a Beatle's song
B00005JSGK|5.0|Was watching it yesterday with my kids. <br />This is a non eviscerated, genuine product from another age. Hollywood is now sooo politically correct that everythings seems wrapped in plastic. <br />First scenes: rhino chase, man gets gored, rushed to hospital. <br />Crew learns the guy's ok. They smoke like toads, drink like sponges and after the boozing, drive the cars 3 hours to their camp. They arrive so drunk that they need directions to their own bedrooms. Then, they keep chasing live animals for zoos. <br />Try to see something even similar nowadays.  <br /> <br />Outstanding film, and a lot of memories.
0739339796|3.0|Dan Brown's THE DAVINCI CODE is a novel for those who think they are reading a serious book about a serious topic: the very sources of the Church's right to exist. For more than two milennia, the Church has based its dogma on its express belief that Jesus Christ was born of divine intervention, was killed by mortal hand, and rose from the dead by divine intervention. During this 2,000 year history, many have come forth with claims that Christ was born mortal, died mortal, and remains mortally dead. Dan Brown now writes of a Christ whose life, death, and resurrection has been manipulated by high Church officials to ensure the longevity and ongoing power of its own structure. There is no way to prove the claims either way, though recently Brown has been sued by another writer who claims that Brown plagiarized plot elements from his own book.<br /><br />In this book, THE DAVINCI CODE, Brown writes in a style that carries the reader along in such a manner that there is no chance that any implausibilities of plot will become evident. It is almost as if Brown has taken to heart the plot rules from a text called HOW TO WRITE A BEST SELLING NOVEL. He begins with a murder in an art museum by an albino who leaves his victim alive just long enough to etch onto the floor the first in a series of tantalizing clues that propel the reader from page to page.  The hero is a cardboard character named Langdon, who follows these clues as if each one were the Hoily Grail. The point of the novel is that Langdon is seeking the Grail.  Along the way, he (and the reader)are given some fascinating if unverified assertions about the birth and death of Christ. What he learns is that each clue is sort of like reading a text explicating the deconstructionist literary criticism of Derrida, who states that each element in a work of literature is no more than a sign pointing to other signs, which in turn point to still other signs.  The result is that you have a whole lot of signs but not much meaning. When I finished reading THE DAVINCI CODE, I felt that I had just been taken on an extended journey of biblical road signs with Templars pointing to Mary Magdalene pointing to Rosicrucians pointing to the \\"The Last Supper\\" painting, and so on in an infinite loop.  And all of this is not necessarily a bad thing.  What Brown has given the reader is all that most readers really want--a good read that teaches something along the way.  What it teaches is a function of that reader.  In my case, I learned to look at certain historical paintings with a new eye to see if the hand on Jesus's shoulder is more feminine than is usually assumed.aning.

B000EF7ZRM|3.0|Not a bad film at all. Leonardo Di Caprio looks a bit too young in the role (until some excellent make up manages to edge him up to about 30ish) but its a better performance better than usual (think Brad Pitt in Twelve Monkey's or Tom Holt's Amadeus and you'll be in the right ballpark). The story, although true, is a familiar one; a man's genius drives him insane and tragedy. I knew next to nothing about Howard Hughes prior to watching the film and am now facinated so I guess that means the film is a success.
B00004STPT|5.0|The melodies contained within this CD are haunting, beautiful, grave, tender, soothing, riveting, tumultous, reflective, and more to me. This is truly an awesome collection of melodies and themes, that, complement a landmark film like no other soundtrack out there.
B00005JO20|5.0|King Kong is one of the best movies of 2005 as Peter Jackson gives an excellent follow-up to his wildly successful Lord of the Rings series. This movie takes full advantage of special effects and other technology to bring Kong to life as well as some other creatures. With excellent lead performances and beautiful scenery and shots, King Kong is a needed remake of the 1933 classic. <br /> <br />Naomi Watts is outstanding as Ann Darrow, a struggling actress who accepts the lead role in Carl Denham's new picture. Denham, played by Jack Black, is also struggling in the movie business. When Ann accepts the role \\"she was born to play\\", the two set off with screenplay writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to Skull Island, an undiscovered island that supposedly holds primitive life, where Denham wants to shoot his film. When they reach Skull Island, the crew is immediately confronted by natives, who capture Ann and take her to be sacrificed to a monster that lives on the other side of a stone wall built along the edge of the native civilization. When Ann is taken by Kong, Jack Driscoll plays the unlikely hero trying to save her, while Denham sees a scheme to make money out of the venture after all. <br /> <br />Watts does an excellent job with the whole aspect of fearing Kong and attempting to make sure he doesn't eat her by various methods. The two form a surprisingly close bond. Unlike the 1933 film, the attraction is not just from Kong, it is mutual. Andy Serkis, who used motion capture technology to play Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, makes another excellent performance playing Kong. He captures the ape's emotions wonderfully, especially when he laughs at Ann's Vaudeville routine. <br /> <br />This film is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen. 1933 New York City has never looked this good, especially the view from atop the Empire State Building. These beautiful shots are completed by surprisingly moving moments, like when Kong and Ann watch a sunset from a high cliff, or when they share their final moment together on the Empire State Building, where Kong is trying to protect her from her own species. The end is heartbreaking, with Naomi Watts playing the best few minutes of running time in her career. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson does an excellent job bringing  Kong to life in this remake of the 1933 classic. The performances and scenery are great, there are enough creepy creatures and action scenes to keep us on the edge of our seats, and there are enough tender moments to strengthen the emotional relationship between King Kong and Ann. One of the best of 2005. 5 stars out of 5.
B000001FYZ|3.0|This is their album containing the famous and wonderful \\" Wind Of Change \\", I also like the Tease Me Please Me,To Be With You In Heaven and Send Me An Angel but the other songs are not that great.Overall the album is not as necessary laudy,noisy and hard for a metal album.
0312954468|5.0|This is as exciting as you can get if you love history and true adventure. The entire series, starting with River God is so absorbing and captivating that you can hardly put it down. I hate for books like these to end. Wilbur Smith is an extraordinary writer who can bring you right there and have you dreaming of the past and all it's beauty, violence, majesty, action and passions with characters you will think about and miss after you close the book. Keep writing Wilbur Smith!
B0002WS3RS|5.0|This excellent 1973 release by Gong was the second installment in the Radio Gnome Trilogy.  The lineup on this album is absolutely classic Gong and includes Tim Blake (VCS3 and mini-moog synthesizers); Pierre Moerlen (drums); Mike Howlett (bass); Daevid Allen (guitar, vocals); Didier Maherbe (woodwinds); Steve Hillage (guitar); and Gilli Smyth (space whisper, vocals).  A great deal of the music on Angel's Egg is very spacey, which is driven largely by Tim Blake's atmospheric synthesizer work, along with Gilli Smyth's cosmic and heavily-echoed \\"space whisper\\".  On the other side of the coin however, is some seriously virtuosic drumming by Pierre Moerlen and alternately spacey and heavy guitar work by Steve Hillage.  Bassist Mike Howlett is no slouch either and his thunderous playing really drives everything along.  As a general rule, this band was always comprised of superb musicians and their ability to swing from jazz rock, to space rock, to spacey free-form and back again always impressed me.  In addition to virtuosity, this music exhibits the quintessentially whimsical Canterburian sense of humor, which is expressed through the surreal and \\"dadaist\\" lyrics of Daevid Allen.  EMI did a great job of remastering this album, and the 14 page booklet features liner notes that \\"explain\\" the premise underlying the Radio Gnome Trilogy (up through Part II at least), and discusses topics including the Planet Gong; Master of the Spheres; Octave Doctors; Pot Head Pixies and the like.  In addition to the original album, there are five bonus tracks including a single version of Other side of the Sky, the outtake Ooby-Scooby Doomsday or the D-Day DJ's got the DDT Blues, a vocal mix of Love is How Y Make It, and an early version of Eat that Phone Book Coda.  Overall the bonus tracks are OK, and with the exception of the excellent Ooby-Scooby, do not add too much to the original album.  Fortunately, EMI did not use copy control technology on this album, so playback problems should not be an issue.  This album is very highly recommended along with Magick Brother (1970); Camembert Electrique (1971); Flying Teapot (RGI Pt. 1) (1973); and You (RGI Pt. 3)(1974).not be an issue.

B00008AWOD|5.0|Bands come and go, this is a band that is still going but sadly never really came to the limelight they deserve.  This album is my favourite from their collection, songs like \\"special needs\\" still keep their original sound, \\"english summer rain\\" is such a great song, for anyone lucky to see them live then this song will move you.  I think if you're looking for an introcudtion to the band then buy their \\"black market music\\" album as its more single orientated, but if you love the band then this album is just fantastic as it adds a little bit more to their sound than before.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|This 1974 album was released shortly after the departure of both Ian Gillan and excellent bassist Roger Glover in 1973, thus ending the Mk. II lineup (at least until 1984).  On the Burn album, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore (who cranks out some unbelievable leads), drummer Ian Paice, and keyboardist John Lord were joined by new band members David Coverdale (lead vocals) and bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes.  To say the least, I was a little suspicious of the new Mk. III lineup.  With respect to the new members, Glenn Hughes (like Roger) also used a trebly Rickenbacker bass (which is a major plus in my book), although he was not as technically advanced as Roger.  David Coverdale however, really belts out and is an extremely powerful singer.<br /><br />OK, so the new members fit in well enough, so what about the music?  With the explosive opening of the title track Burn I was convinced that the band was forging onwards without missing a beat.  All of the components that made Deep Purple great were in place, but there was something else too.  The arrangements on Burn seemed a bit more complex than usual, and what was this? Bach influenced chord progressions? Toccata-like Hammond organ solos? Mini-moog synthesizer solos on a Deep Purple song?  This was something a little different (much to the delight of this raving prog fan), and it appeared that the influences of prog giants like ELP had worked their way into the writing style of at least a few guys in the band, which are very much in evidence on the title track Burn.  In fact, Burn stands as my all-time favorite Deep Purple tune because it is so proggy.  Other tracks on the album that are different (and personal favorites) include Sail Away, which features more great work on the mini-moog and a highly syncopated 4/4 that makes the piece sound busier than it is; the experimental, mini-moog heavy track \\"A 200\\" (which is named after a disinfectant and seems to be based on Mars from Gustav Holst's Planets); and the spacey jam on Mistreated.  For those of you that don't like prog as much as I do, don't worry - 90% of the album is comprised of the solid, well-played bluesy hard rock that made the band so famous.<br /><br />As an aside, a lot of folks (including critics) have commented that Deep Purple employed funk styles in their music during this lineup.  To be perfectly honest, I hear very little funk in any of the pieces on this album - if anything, I hear American \\"boogie\\" influences.  My guess is that the \\"funkiness\\" is an artifact of the abundant use of a syncopated 4/4, which lends the pieces a little more \\"swing\\" than usual.  For those of you that are afraid of funk music, fear not - this is hard rock, pure and simple.  I should note that I have not listened to either Stormbringer (1974) or Come Taste the Band (1975).  These two albums may very well be funky, but I am still not entirely convinced that Deep Purple will ever be mentioned in the same context as groups like Parliament Funkadelic or Sly and the Family Stone.<br /><br />With respect to the remastered album, Rhino did a brilliant job.  There is a 23-page booklet loaded with informational tidbits and color photos of the band.  In that I am not entirely familiar with Deep Purple, I found the liner notes to be very helpful, but long-time followers of the band may dismiss them as \\"old hat\\".  In addition to the original album, there are five bonus tracks that were remixed in 2004 including the amazing instrumental Coronarias Redig (which was released as a b-side single), along with tracks from the original album.  With respect to the remixed versions of the original tracks, they don't sound terribly different.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album of hard rock that offers just enough spice and variety to draw prog rock fans like myself in.  For Deep Purple fans that are interested, Manfred Mann's Earth Band released an album in 1973 entitled Solar Fire that you may also like.  Although the album is closer to prog thanhard rock, there are enough stylistic commonalities that it should be of interest.hard rock, there are enough stylistic commonalities that it should be of interest.
1577311523|1.0|I read this book because of all the hype.  I found it very disappointing.  He makes strange claims about energy and frequencies that make no sense.  The entire book is just an overview of buddhism written by a white guy. <br /> <br />If this topic interests you, then read some REAL buddhism, or better yet, go to a temple.  I live in Toronto and there are literally dozens of temples here. <br /> <br />Tolle is the kind of huckster that reads other peoples work and then writes a book claiming the ideas are something new and feels he is right because people who are looking for spiritual answers tell him he is.  I don't think he is a \\"con man\\", but a lousy author with bad ideas that he has taken from other people. <br /> <br />There are thousands of other books that handle these ideas much better.  Please stop making guys like this rich.
B000002VC5|4.0|My first exposure to the Alan Parsons Project was with the Ammonia Avenue album (1984) while a senior in high school (also 1984).  Unfortunately, I did not explore the band much further than that album, which is too bad - this 1977 release is pretty good and a bit more interesting musically.<br /><br />The core musicians on this concept album about the \\"rise of machines and the fall of man\\", include Alan Parsons (organ, synthesizers, acoustic guitar, projectron, vocoder, and additional vocals); David Paton (bass guitar); Stuart Tosh (drums); Ian Bairnson (electric and acoustic guitars); and Eric Woolfson (synthesizers, projectron, vocoder, and additional vocals).  Although there are supporting musicians, including a steel guitar player, a cimbalom player, and a large cast of lead vocalists and backup singers, they are far too numerous to list here.  The vocalists (and there are several) are all pretty good and their voices work very well with the particular track they were selected for.<br /><br />The ten tracks on the album alternate between upbeat, orchestrated symphonic pop tracks and instrumental tracks that feature heavy synthesizer use.  Six of the ten tracks feature vocals and four are instrumental.  Unfortunately disco influences are present, especially on the track \\"I wouldn't want to be like You\\", which really detracts from the overall quality of the album.  My favorite tracks include the opening instrumental \\"I Robot\\", the moody \\"Don't Let it Show\\" and \\"Some Other Time\\", \\"The Voice\\", the Pink Floyd-esque \\"Day after Day\\", and the spacey, synth-heavy instrumentals \\"Nucleus\\", \\"Total Eclipse\\" and the haunting \\"Genesis Ch.1 V.32\\".<br /><br />In that Alan Parsons was a sound engineer for rock groups known for their excellent production values (Pink Floyd), both the sound quality and production are excellent, even though the CD has not been remastered.<br /><br />All in all, the I Robot album is recommended along with Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976) and Pyramid (1978) to folks that are interested in exploring British symphonic pop, which is an offshoot of progressive rock.  These three albums are the most interesting the entire symphonic pop genre had to offer.Pyramid (1978) to folks that are interested in exploring British symphonic pop, which is an offshoot of progressive rock.

The way this story was worte it really keeps you on the edge the whole time. I could swear i could actually see things as they were happening as I was reading it.  Very well written book. Stephen Ambrose did a fantastic job telling the story of these mens lives. Best book Ive ever read, start to finish!!!
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer self titled.  The blue album.  whatever it's called.  This is arguably where emo core had its nemisis, at least in top 40 land.  It seems like Weezer fans break into two group-those who favor this and those who favor pinkerton.  I really don't know where I am.  Kinda depends on the day.  Lots of people don't care for the later weezer, which is where I deviate, because I love Maladriot and Green (Make believe falters a bit), but just about anybody who appreciates post-nirvana grundge-emo-alternative rock \\"candy\\" can appreciate this.  If you don't have it pick it up, or beware on judgement day.
B000002IZM|5.0|Vangelis has released many fascinating albums over the years but in many ways he has never topped this unique electronic score for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. It's unfortunate that a musician as talented as Vangelis is sometimes lumped into the eternally derided category of \\"New Age\\" music because Vangelis is so much more than the many hacks who inhabit that new age domain. Vangelis is a magician with synth-textures for instance and his melodic gifts are quite rare. <br /> <br />Almost all the tracks here are great, from the atmospheric to the energetic, the man can do it all. This music makes the film better and it of course stands on it's own quite magnificiently, which is what every film composer strives to create. Vangelis is much more than just a film composer but it is interesting that he achieves much of his best work working on various films and Blade Runner is probably the best in that particular category. <br /> <br />For the tiny asking price, there is no way the Blade Runner Soundtrack should be missing from your collection. If you crave more from this melodically inclined electronic master, check out his albums, \\"Opera Sauvage\\" and \\"Direct\\".
0805066691|3.0|Let me first say, Dee Brown's book, BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE is a well written classic that flows nicely. It contains great structure and is a pleasure to read. Certainly no right thinking person would disagree that the American Indians were used and abused by the government at every turn. The treaties the Indians signed were more often than not, not worth the paper they were written on. Murderous cowards like Chivington betrayed those who declared themselves peaceful and friends of the whites, like Black Kettle and the Cheyenne atrocity at Sand Creek. While still under British rule, Indians of the Ohio Valley were victims of one of the first instances of bio-terrorism when the British knowingly and deliberately infected them with small pox.<br /><br />So while it is safe to say the sentiment of Brown's book is clearly accurate and justified, for the overall scope of the book, exception must be taken by anyone seeking the cold hard truth. Since Brown's book was published, and quickly popularized, most historians have followed Brown's approach to viewing the Indian wars of the American West from a strictly ethnocentric viewpoint. To them, the term \\"Indian wars\\" has come to mean only \\"Indian - White wars\\", fought primarily to interrupt the flow of the expansion of white settlement. Paul Wellman began this trend in 1934 with his publication of the account of the 1862 Minnesota Massacre, DEATH ON THE PRARIE. However, what Wellman began, Brown perfected, until we have now reach, in this country, where the history of the American Indian is involved, a sort of Zinnian approach (a phrase I coined myself after revisionist historian Howard Zinn) to the re-writing or revision of American history, in this case specifically, the history of the American West.<br /><br />I come to this conclusion for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is Brown's subtitle, \\"An Indian History of the American West\\". If that is, indeed, what he is seeking to fully examine, then Brown ignores the fact that Indians of different tribes held very different views of that history. He sought to interpret the Indian wars of the northern plains only as \\"Indian-white\\" wars and described them only from the viewpoint of the Sioux hostiles. Brown brushes off as \\"mercenaries\\" those tribes that became allies to the whites against the Sioux.<br /><br />To view the Crow (who white trappers and traders had predicted in the 1830's would soon be extinct due to their far more numerous red enemies) and the Arikara (who also lost their land to the Sioux) as white \\"mercenaries\\" is far beyond simplistic reasoning and completely overlooks the long history of Indian warfare in the region. The Crow, Arikara and many other tribes had been fighting the Sioux (and losing, for the most part) for generations before they received any effective aid from the whites. Brown is shortsighted in his work to attempt to lend understanding of the plight of the Indian without an awareness of the history of intertribal warfare.<br /><br />The Sioux migrated south and west to the Missouri around 1750. In the century preceding and following that movement, the Sioux engaged in war with at least twenty-six other Indian tribes, as well as the River Metis and the U.S. Army. Brown also fails to note that the most dramatic battles fought between the army and the Sioux were on lands the Sioux had taken from other tribes since 1851. Also overlooked is that the Arikara and Hidatsa chiefs who had signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 had both been killed by the Sioux when in 1864, the Arakara Chief White Shield petitioned the army to uphold its treaty and punish the Sioux.<br /><br />Brown's book, as I said earlier, is well written, and parts of it are quite accurate. However, portraying history from only one viewpoint is shortsighted and often has dangerous consequences. Such is the case here. Brown's book has been accepted as gospel and has since led the way to even further revision of the truth.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br />[...]><br />Monty Rainey<br />[...]
0060899190|5.0|My first thought was 'What an odd little book.'  I continued to flip through the pages; the artwrok was in turns quirkily or eeriely funny to gut wrentchingly personal.  Confessions from putting boogers in soup to being victimized are more hauntingly immediate by the illustrations than the actual words.<br /><br />  It is amazing how much you can sympathize with a stranger with only twenty words.  Not to be sappy, but in each card a stranger reaveals something so pure and unique, you can almost envision their daily lives.  And wonder about how to express your own secrets.
1591840562|5.0|Starting a small business can be overwhelming. Many people who try experience feelings of inadequacy much like high school students feel when trying to write their first term paper for English class. If you are hoping to start a business in the future, or you are in the midst of doing so now, I highly recommend you read this book. It is light, easy to read, and informative.<br /><br />The content of the book is broken into five groupings:<br /><br />1. Causation (think it up)<br /><br />2. Articulation (write it up)<br /><br />3. Activation (implement it)<br /><br />4. Proliferation (monitor it & reevaluate it)<br /><br />5. Obligation (be good)<br /><br />In a way, I found this book to be another one on business planning and strategic planning. However, it is presented in a different way than any other book I've read on these topics. This book reads more like an authoritative guide written by someone who has already \\"been there\\" and who did not have to do a lot of research to fill in the book's content. In comparison, many of the other books I've read seem to have been written by high school students writing their first term paper. Do yourself a favor and read this book. You will be glad you did.
B000EGCITG|5.0|First off....I love Pink. Even when her first, and least like pink,  cd came out, I loved her. \\"Missundaztood\\" showed us that this girl could really sing and write songs that were deep and could still get the party started. With \\"Try This\\", we saw a true rock star.  <br /> <br />\\"I'm Not Dead\\" combines her rock from \\"Try This\\", and her sassyness of \\"Missundaztood\\". For this record, Linda Perry is nowhere to be found. She helped Pink reach the top with \\"Missunaztood\\", but mysteriouly isn't here for this record. Even though she isn't here, Pink shines the most on this album than on any of her others. A collaboration that I didn't see coming, was with pop mastermind Max Martin, who is responsible for Britney Spears's first 3 albums, as well as helping *NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys, and creating the mega-hit \\"Since You've Been Gone.\\" He helped with the tracks \\"Who Knew\\" which is set to be the second single. This, the second track on the cd, is an amazing song. She sings her heart out and sounds a lot like the great Janis Jolin. A very relateable song that will touch you. He also helped with \\"Cuz I Can\\", probably the most kick ass song on the cd.  <br /> <br />\\"Woo hoo rock and roll. RA RA. Alright I drink more than you. I party harder than you do, and my car's faster than yours too. HA! P-I-N-K P-I-M-P. I'm back again, I know y'all missed me. I'm so so sick. Can't handle it. Yeah, I talk s***,just deal with it.\\"  <br /> <br />It's truely Pink's anthem. Her performance on the V-Spot on VH1.com is amazing. He also helped with \\"U + Ur Hand\\" a fun song about a guy who's trying to pick her up. You can guess what she's sanging about him and his hand that night. Mr Martin really knows how to write a catchy song. Rumored 3rd single. <br /> <br />All the tracks are amazing, but here are some of the standout songs. <br /> <br />\\"Stupid Girls\\"- This first single, which is so sadly true about our society. Whenever I see a girl like she describes, I sing it in my head. Thank you for finally saying it. From blogs I've been too, parents really love this song, as well as the in your face video. <br /> <br />\\"Who Knew\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Long Way To Happy\\"- An amazingly emotional track that seems like she's reading the minds of many people in this world who are going through so much. Powerfully written and sang. <br /> <br />\\"Nobody Knows\\"- Emotional, Powerful, Beautifully sang. That's all I can say. <br /> <br />\\"Dear Mr. President\\"- Once again....THANK YOU Pink for writing this song. It's taken forever for someone to write a track like this that is just so emotional and so true. That's the thing about Pink, she's gonna say what she thinks. She's gonna put it in your face and make you hear it. I hope Mr. Bush has heard this  track. She collaborated with the Indigo Girls for the vocals on this track. My friend cried when I played it. <br /> <br />\\"Cuz I Can\\" <br /> <br />\\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\"- GREAT GREAT SONG. It's all about how we wanna be with someone, but then we want them to go away so that we can be alone. The push and pull of a relationship. My friend's favorites.  <br /> <br />\\"The One That Got Away\\"- This is the bluesy, acoustic song on here that has not gloss or anything synthetic, just a guitar and vocals. It sounds like the songs that used to be sung in bars. I can just imagine people a smoked filled bar with people watching this great performance, and drinking beer. Great vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Conversations with my 13 Year Old Self\\"- Something we all do. Look back at our past. If you have an emotional track, then you can really relate to what Miss Alicia Moore is saying. She really hits you with the bridge that is so heartfelt and beautiful. <br /> <br />The rest of the tracks are all amazing as well. \\"I'm Not Dead\\", \\"Runaway\\", \\"I Got Money Now\\" (\\"Missunaztood\\" like), and the hidden track which is touching beyond belief \\"I Have Seen The Rain\\", a track with her father. <br /> <br />Pink once again stuns us with a CD that is amazinglywritten, sung, and put together. With the combo of Rock, R&B, and Pop, this cd's proves Pink is here to stay whether you like it or not.
B00009RDG9|5.0|Three facts about this film help to make it highly-rated in my book: it's very entertaining, moves fast and lasts only 90 minutes.  <br /> <br />So, if in the mood for a combination Fugitive/Rambo story with two very intense lead actors, this is a convenient diversion to play numerous times. <br /> <br />Tommy Lee Jones was the mentor who trained Benico Del Toro on the art of killing and now the ex-student has gone out of control and Jones must hunt him down, something the police can't seem to do. That's the story, simple as that. The only thing was a little implausible is that old man chasing down a kid for miles. Tommy Lee might be in shape, but he isn't young enough to do what he does here. However, both men are fun to watch and the action scenes are well done. You don't get bored watching this movie. <br /> <br />No, the film isn't high-grade mentality but it isn't totally stupid, either. It doesn't get carried and is pretty believable until the final chase scene. Along the way, we are treated the Portland cityscape and Northwest woods, both of which are nicely filmed and look great on this DVD. <br />
B00004XOWM|3.0|But so what? It's definitely not the worst either. This album can be enjoyable. Especially when you are 11 (or just don't give a fu*k about the lyrics) and need to have a lot of angry, catchy songs filled with a lot of curse words to rock out to.
B00003CXCW|4.0|On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but  the more I see it the more I like it and appreciate it.....especially on this special two-disc DVD. It sports a magnificentl transfer! This is a good visual film to start with, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place, and now it's given its full justice with this great-looking DVD. <br /> <br />To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again.  <br /> <br />Gloria Swanson, who plays the role, overacts and certainly is not appealing, even bordering on grotesque at times, but she isn't supposed to look good. That's one of the points of the story. Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration. <br /> <br />The most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler, played by Eric von Stroheim. He's amazing in this film. In supporting roles, I also enjoyed the wholesome Nancy Olsen and the young Jack Webb of \\"Dragnet\\" fame. <br /> <br />This combination of drama-soap opera-film noir is one of the professional critics all-time favorite films. Odd how they love movies and Hollywood stars so much, yet relish films that tear them down, as this does.  <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|When I bought this I had only heard 3 songs from it and thought that the rest won't be so good. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is awesome, but remember it's just the first track on the album, what follows is something truly amazing. There is no bad song on this album. The journey from the hard rocking \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to acoustic ballad \\"Polly\\" to haunting \\"Something In The Way\\" is a unique ride filled with some of the most memorable songs you'll ever hear. The cd as whole is just brilliant.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Although I enjoyed this film and rate it  high, I have to admit this was more than a bit of a stretch for most people, and for at least four good reasons: 1 - Anthony Hopkins being a light-skinned black man; 2 - Nicole Kidman being a white trailer trash person (no person that poor looks that good!); 3 - A beautiful woman like Kidman falling for a much-older man like Hopkins unless it was for money, which he does not have in here, and 4 - Ed Harris' character would have been locked up and unable to affect things in the end, as shown here. <br /> <br />If you can go along  with all of those credibility issues, you have a very interesting film on your hands to watch. It also look super on widescreen DVD and has a terrifice soundtrack.  Don't miss the beautiful piano piece during the ending credits, either. <br /> <br />Once again, I enjoyed the acting of Hopkins, one of the best of his generation. Just the looks on his face alone are fascinating in this film. Kidman is interesting, too, with my only complaint being her overuse of the f-word. Ninety percent of them in this movie come from her. Gary Sinise is the nice-guy friend who narrates the film. <br /> <br />This is a deep human-interest story of a black man who winds up - in an earlier era - posing as a white man so he can have a better chance at a successful career. In the process, he sacrifices his roots, his family and siblings, which comes back to haunt him. He's also a victim, ironically, of political correctness on the subject of race. Wow, it's unusual - and refreshing - to see how PC can run amok and hurt well-meaning people, as demonstrated in this story. <br /> <br />Going into further details might spoil the rest of it, so I'll end here. This is a film I found surprisingly engrossing and if you can withstand the f-word, one I recommend.  <br />

B000E1155E|4.0|I first heard them while driving along with friends, but it was turned down so low I barely paid any attention.  Then I heard the single and it's just one of those songs that you can't help but bounce around to.  I never heard the hype, thank god, because this album is actually pretty good.  It is rare to find an album where you don't skip over any tracks, I.E. both Franz Ferdinand CDs.  True, there are some songs that are catchier than others, but none of them are \\"putrid\\" as some people have referred to them as.  Bad words are used, but its not like every other word is \\"f*ck\\".  People just need to calm down and stop bashing on them.  Theyre in their early 20s and having fun, and the listeners can tell.
B00007KWHN|5.0|I'm really into progressive rock and this is definitely up at about the top of the heap of that category. I wore this cassette out when I was about to finish high school. I had a killer sounding car cassette deck that had a equalizer booster that was out of this world. This has four long epic tracks that I never seem to tire of hearing. Also, it has a couple of songs that some would think is filler, but they are far from that in my opinion. My two favorite songs on here are &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; and &quot;Your's Is No Disgrace&quot;. Brilliant stuff if you ask me. I've probably heard &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; and &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; a lot more on my radio stations, and of course, they're brilliant also, maybe I'm just a little sick of hearing them constantly, but they're definitely classic Yes to be sure. Steve Howe seems to be the ingredient and shot in the arm that they needed to become a progressive supergroup. I'm not sure of too many reasons to buy these Rhino remasters (except if the sound quality is greatly improved), because they often offer alternative takes and other kinds of worthless bonus tracks, but I have heard some say that they like the sound quite a bit better. I think that I just might keep my original issue and maybe think of purchasing it in the not to distant future. This is definitely the best album to start off your collection with, and maybe try FRAGILE next, but don't start off with RELAYER yet because it's a pretty crazy and wild ride for a newcomer. Enjoy this progressive masterpiece!!!
0393317552|4.0|This is a great read for anyone who would like to here another side of the \\"evolution\\" of human society through pre-antiquity. The use of logic is great, Diamond uses simple logic to escort his ideals about society through time. If read carefully this book makes great points and influences thinking *gasp* very interesting book for anyone that enjoys reading ideas about human society!
B00007KWHP|5.0|I've heard many people say that FRAGILE is better than THE YES ALBUM, but really, nothing could be further from the truth. There are at least three filler nothing songs that are super short timewise, but the THE YES ALBUM has absolutely no filler at all, period. Of course everybody thinks this is so great because of the three epic tracks like &quot;Roundabout&quot;, &quot;Heart Of the Sunrise&quot;, and &quot;Long-Distance Runaround&quot;, and &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot; is definitely to me worth the price of the album, but as a whole, this isn't anywhere near as good as THE YES ALBUM. HOTS sounded like it should have been a part of the YES ALBUM because it's kind of in that style. It's definitely one of the top four or five Yes songs. Also, the great bass line on &quot;Roundabout&quot; is killer. Chris Squire is definitely up there with Geddy Lee and Steve Harris as one of the best bass players. I still only pull this disc out about every couple of years to hear the three epic tracks because I have such a massive collection of mostly all different types of rock and even more classical, so all that adds up to about 2,500 cds. I definitely would recommend THE YES ALBUM for your first purchase if you are new to this group. It definitely should blow you away if you're smart. I still would heartily recommend this one after that. Enjoy!
B00067HP0A|4.0|\\"Mogambo\\" (1953) is a good film with an excellent ending that makes you want to watch it again. Of course, the excellent cast and the place where the story was filmed help, and a lot.<br /><br />This movie was directed by John Ford, and filmed in Africa. The plot is simple, but quite effective. Victor Marswell (Clark Gable) is a safari guide whose like is disrupted when a beautiful woman, Eloise Kelly (Ava Gardner), shows up at his camp, looking for a majarajah. Unfortunately for her, her \\"acquaintance\\" has left and she has to remain in the camp at least until the next boat arrives. Eloise starts to fall for Victor, and their attraction seems mutual, but not meant to be.<br /><br />However, things are further stirred up when a couple, Professor Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly) arrive to Victor's complex for a safari. The problem is that now Eloise likes Victor, Victor is attracted to Linda, and Linda has feelings for Victor but is married to Donald, who is not aware of what is happening around him and is only interested in looking for gorillas.<br /><br />Of course, that situation is a good recipe for entertainment. Throw in a great scenery and some wild animals, and you have a very entertaining movie. All in all, I give this movie 3.5 stars, and I think it is worthwhile to recommend it  :)
B00079FUI6|5.0|\\"Desperate Housewives\\" is a great show- it draws you as a watcher into the events, and you'll probably end up having strong opinions about the various ladies and their men.  By the time I finished the first season there were some that I hated, and others that I liked a great deal.  The narration of the show is done by a deceased woman named Alice Young, which is by itself a unique concept, and revolves loosely around how and why she killed herself.  Throughout the season the sordid undercurrents of Wisteria Lane (aka Suburbia USA) are explored in an entertaining and usually humorous fashion.  All of the Actors/Actresses do a fine job.<br /><br />I was hesitant to event give the show a chance, being a man; but my brother gave it a good recommendation, and I figured my wife and I could watch it and have some fun.  We did & we can't wait for season 2.
0825439019|5.0|\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" (1961) is simply a classic, one of those films you just need to watch. I did that tonight. Why didn't I watch it before? I suppose I wasn't curious enough, and I didn't think that this movie could live up to the buzz. Thankfully, I was wrong.<br /><br />The story takes place in New York, and is based on a novella written by Truman Capote, adapted to the screen by George Axelrod and directed by Blake Edwards. The cast is simply wonderful, and the wardrobe, stunning.<br /><br />One of the main characters is the exquisitely beautiful Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), an enchanting young woman with many secrets that lives off the gifts given to her by older men. Holly has a cat without a name, because \\"The way I see it I haven't got the right to give him one. We don't belong to each other. We just took up one day by the river. I don't want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I'm not sure where that is but I know what it is like. It's like Tiffany's\\".<br /><br />Holly's main purpose in life is to marry someone with lots of money, and finally be free. There is a small flaw in her plan, though: it doesn't take into account the fact that she might fall in love. However, that is just what might happen when she discovers a new neighbour, Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a struggling writer financed by an older woman, that happens to be very handsome and easy to talk to. When Holly and Paul meet, a friendship begins to develop between them. But can something else happen, when Paul has no money, and Holly is afraid of being in love and belonging to someone? Watch this film, and find out!<br /><br />All in all, I think that \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is the kind of movie you will want to watch more than once. Again, a classic to be enjoyed :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|There's a lot to be said about Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Square-Enix's ambitious CGI sequel to the popular RPG of the same name (minus the subtitle). A game that many remember as the Final Fantasy that has sold over 9 million copies to-date, their first RPG, and the game that spawned a million works of FanFiction and twice as many Sephiroth -- and Cloud -- \\"Clones\\" on internet message boards, Final Fantasy VII is one of the most memorable and groundbreaking titles in gaming history. <br /> <br />As such, there was a great deal of expectation that lay with this film sequel during its two year production period. It is, after all, the sequel to the title that allowed RPGs to achieve mainstream success in North America and other areas of the world outside Japan, opening up the eyes of many to a world of gaming beyond Fighting and Racing games, outside the simple dungeon-scrolling Adventure title and other genres, incorporating elements of them all while also achieving an end-product that -- while not necessarily better or inferior -- was most certainly different. Advent Children had a lot to live up to. Did it? <br /> <br />Before I pass my judgement in that regard, I will first touch on those many things I mentioned earlier that can be said about the film. First, and most obviously, if you're a hardcore fan of the original game or the Final Fantasy series in general -- provided, of course, that VII is one of the games you've played in the series -- then this film is for you. To say that it is fanservice would be an understatement (note that fanservice isn't a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination), perhaps illustrated greatest by the late introductions of the entire original cast to confront a powerful rampaging foe. That being the case, if you've never played Final Fantasy VII or don't know its story, Square-Enix would love for you to become engrossed by this film and join the ranks of Final Fantasy VII fans, but more likely than not, you'll join the ranks of those who chose to watch the film with little to no knowledge of its backstory and subsequently went through a head-scratching phase that lasted for weeks on end. This is to be expected, however. The film was, of course, not made with the uninitiated in mind. <br /> <br />That said, to be fair, Advent Children also left quite a few individuals who had played the game scratching their heads, so there's not necessarily any shame in that. Its story isn't quite presented on a silver-platter, leaving one to contemplate what they have seen and piece together a few things on their own, as well as make a few personal determinations that -- as of right now -- can be neither confirmed nor denied. Further still, there are aspects of the story that are greatly expanded upon by supplementary materials, some packaged with the film, while others are not. All of this adds up to a great deal of depth, which, sadly, many will overlook due to expecting everything to be within the film itself. Those more accustomed to the Hollywood style especially will fall victim to this unfortunate oversight. <br /> <br />All this isn't to say that someone who has never played Final Fantasy VII or previously viewed any Final Fantasy materials should steer clear of the film. It is, however, to say that knowing all this should serve as a warning to any who would consider viewing the film without first immersing themselves in its 40+ hours of backstory. To say that this lack of familiarity could detract from the experience would be putting things lightly. <br /> <br />That said, it is still possible to enjoy the film regardless of one's past experience -- or lack thereof -- with Final Fantasy. There's plenty of eye candy to admire, both in terms of the stylized action sequences and the impressive quality of the imagery itself. The film is the most impressive and ambitious CGI undertaking to-date, likely to catch not only the attention -- and appreciation -- of techies and those with an interestin computer animated rendering, but that of the average movie-goer as well. Even the most low-tech and non-computer-oriented of viewers will find something to marvel at in Advent Children's thousands of breathtaking frames. <br /> <br />While possessing the appearance of realism in both environments and people, the characters' designs were conceived in such a way as to alter their appearances just enough from that of real homo sapiens so as to maintain an air of fantasy and remind one that they are not witnessing just a movie, but the most visually impressive CGI film ever rendered. From the strands of each character's hair to the summoning of a Dragon boasting the power to decimate cities, Advent Children never fails to be visually stunning. Though the film feels somewhat sporadically paced early on and oddly edited at other times -- this likely arising as a result of the film not originally being designed with a full-length feature in mind, but, rather, a series of clips instead -- any disorientation levels out by the end of the first half hour and the last two-thirds of the film hold together extremely well. One simply has to get past a somewhat shaky start and the film will keep them in good hands from there on out. <br /> <br />With all that out of the way, we'll now turn our attention to those this film was made for: The fans. For many who have played Final Fantasy VII, they became utterly immersed in its world and some part of them never left it. For these viewers, this film and its supplementary materials should serve to play on their nostalgia and weave for them a tale both satisfying and arousing, equally thirst-quenching and thirst-inducing. However, it should be kept in mind that without exposure to the film's supplementary materials, even long-time fans of Final Fantasy VII may find themselves experiencing twinges of disappointment, or even feeling pangs of confusion. Just as one should view A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back -- if not also The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith -- from the Star Wars saga if they were to watch The Return of the Jedi, so too should one familiarize themselves with all of Advent Children's supplementary materials and related narrative, as they will fail to experience the full story otherwise. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this film is a monumental achievement from Square-Enix, Directors Tetsuya Nomura and Takeshi Nozue, and Scenario Writer Kazushige Nojima. It is a sequel both befitting and respectful of its predecessor, and truly feels like something that belongs as part of its continuity. The dedication and heart invested by its creators doesn't fail to shine, nor will a satisfying experience for fans of the original.

As i started reading this book I also related it to my life and found that many of the things which are mentioned in the book are true, not the story but the message the writer is trying to give. This is a self help book and I suggest it to be read by everyone. <br /> <br />
B00007LTIL|5.0|As many people have already stated this album is one of the best if  not the best Grateful Dead studio albums recorded, containing the perfect mix of rock blues and country.  What many people have not stated is this is one of the classic albums of American Rock.  This album has influenced so many other artists like Ryan Adams, his album cover for Cold Roses is a copy of this American Beauty's art and the music is a reflection of the Dead.  Many other artists have been influnced by the Dead and the every time I hear one of these artists I think of this album defining it as a classic for me.<br /><br />This is the first record of the Dead that I heard.  I was instanly hooked on the words and music of Ripple, Friend of The Devil, Operator, and Box of Rain.  These are the songs on the album that are almost haunting but always beautiful and calming.  Truckin', Sugar Magonlia and the rest of the songs are more upbeat but still beautiful.  After playing this album over and over I started to explore the rest of the Dead's extensive library and loved it just as much as this album.  In other words for people looking to start listening to the Dead this is the album to start with.<br /><br />This album was recently remastered and some extras added.  The orginal songs sound crisper and more beautiful than before and the extras are a nice touch espically the live version of Ripple.  Bottom line buy this album you will not be dissapointed.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I can't stand the Beatles.....why do people like them so much? The earlier stuff is really boring, especially Love me do. I've been listening to the Beatles for about a month and man how hard <br />they sucked. The 60's was a really bad decade of music. They just <br />don't make any guitar solos period. The Beatles don't make good <br />music, period. And this is one of the most dissapointing greatest <br />hits albums I have ever heard plus these guys only made like 7 <br />good songs. The best song on this is probably Hey Jude, and it <br />is one of my top and favorite songs I have ever heard. Also, The <br />Ballad of John and Yoko rocks!!!! A sad song about The Long and <br />Winding road.....ehhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! Stay away from this crap, Green Day American Idiot is much better because it rocks really <br />hard. Get that insted and ignore the 5 star reviewers of this <br />album.

0553208845|5.0|In a very clear and conscise style the author follows the life of the spiritual Siddartha on his path towards self-enlightenment. The protagonist's destiny leads him to successive lifestyle changes ranging from a possessionless ascetic to a wealthy merchant. Along the way he learns many things (like you can't receive pleasure without giving it) and gains many skills (the most important are waiting, thinking, and fasting). The most important lesson, however, is that you can teach knowledge, but you cannot teach wisdom. In order to gain wisdom and self-enlightenment one needs to experience life directly for oneself. Overall, the story is very powerful and thought-provoking.<br /><br />If you like this book, you should also read Herman Hesse's Demian which is at least as powerful as Siddartha and easier to relate to in modern times.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Eli Roth's \\"Hostel\\" wants desperately to be like a grindhouse horror flick from the seventies, in the sliced vein of \\"Last House on the Left\\" and \\"I Spit On Your Grave.\\"  It even has Quentin Tarantino, a huge grindhouse afficionado, as executive producer.  The last half of the film is as brutal and bloody as any horror film released in the last decade, and considering the studios so covet the teen audience that many horror films are released with the accursed PG-13 rating, this kind of cinematic poison is just what we needed.  Of course, the first half of the film is all build-up, so the audience is caught off-guard by the shocks to come.  Unfortunately, the horror crowd thrives on shock, so a lot of gore hounds are too impatient to follow a story, even one as simple as this one.  Three young men (can you say \\"target demographic\\"?), two of them the prototypical Ugly Americans and the other an Ugly Icelander, are backpacking through Europe trying to get laid as much as humanly possible.  A creepy acquaintance points them to Slovakia, where they are told the girls are desperate and willing to screw anybody.  Of course, they soon discover that all is not as it seems and that leads to the inevitable Very Bad Things.  This includes bondage, torture, murder and even worse, and we are spared almost no part of the ordeal.  Okay, so far so good.  I enjoy a good abbatoir slaughter as much as the next freak, and Roth goes about it with impressive enthusiasm (why leave an eyeball just dangling from its socket when you can also cut it right off?), but I really want a good story to go with it.  All that time at the beginning of the movie getting to know the characters is wasted, because these cardboard frat weasels are so stupid and unsympathetic that one wants them to be tortured; heck, many people would volunteer to do it.  In the film, rich jaded businessmen pay thousands of dollars to do the honors, and we, the audience, have only to pay the tiniest fraction of that to watch, but it still feels like a cheat.  We don't care if they live or die, so watching to see if and how they escape is rendered as pointless as the carnage they're subjected to.<br /><br />That carnage, however, is often pretty effective.  Milan Chadima's cinematography is grainy and gritty, lending an air of reality to the most outlandish scenes.  The gore makeup is used so liberally I wouldn't be surprised if it made up half the budget.  One scenery-chewing sequence features Rick Hoffman, as an American \\"client\\" of the den of torture, coming off as a totally psychotic version of Jeremy Piven (Ari Gold on TV's \\"Entourage\\").  It's actually more memorable than a lot of the blood-splattering set pieces.  Oh yeah, and don't forget to look for a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by acclaimed director (and probable inspiration for this project) Takashi Miike.<br /><br />If only the story lived up to these moments, then this \\"Hostel\\" would be worth checking into for a long stay.  As it is, rent a room but don't stick around long.  The smell of the undercooked script can't be disguised by buckets of blood.but it still feels like a cheat.

0316172324|4.0|The thesis of this book is that we all make snap judgements, relying on reasoning not available to our conscious thought processes.  This is not a novel idea.  Gladwell develops this idea by examining under what circumstances such judgments may be surprisingly good, and when they may be terrible.  He is not the most disciplined of writers, and this is not entirely a bad thing.  For example, I enjoyed the explanation of why a cola can do well in a taste test limited to sipping, yet do poorly  as an everyday choice, although this does not really relate to the main ideas of the book. I do sometimes find him verbose, and he frequently employs that breathless style that many popular science writers seem prone to.  Still, this is a deservedly popular book, interesting and informative.  For readers who want to understand unconscious thought processes in somewhat more depth, I unreservedly recommend \\"Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious\\" by Timothy B Wilson.  It is a tribute to Gladwell, that although I read his book after Wilson's, there was enough new stuff to keep me interested.  I wish every citizen could read Gladwell's discussion of the science behind high speed chases and their behavioral aftermath  - think Rodney King case which led to the LA riots.

But in the long run those people will feel just a little, and I do really mean just a little, disappointed. It does seem at times that you're listening to 11 tracks that could almost all be released as singles. This is not a bad thing at all, most bands would strive to achieve what Snow Patrol have here, this album will sell shed loads because its so much more commercially appealing than those before it. But for me, one of the charming features of the old albums was that for every 'Run' there was an obscure track that would never be released as a single.   <br /> <br />
0684824906|4.0|Team of Rivals is an excellent book.  It focuses its attention on Lincoln's time in office, his management of the Civil War, and most importantly his management of his diverse and competitive cabinet members.  It does a fantastic job of developing each of the main members of Lincoln's cabinet, all his rivals for the Presidential nomination.  The book makes clear Lincoln's intuitive understanding of human nature as he holds together the combative personalities and big egos comprising his cabinet.  Additionally, the book shows how Lincoln rose to political power through perserverance and an understanding of the importance of appealing to all aspects of American society.  This everyman approach to politics has been copied by every president since and Team of Rivals makes clear how much modern campaigning is indebted to Abraham Lincoln. Though at times the book is a bit fawning and tends to forgive or excuse Lincoln for many mistakes made during his time in office, it is meticulously researched, well written, and deserving of a place in the cannon of great Lincoln books.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Without a doubt, the highlight is the DVD of the 1975 show in London.  \\"Born to Run,\\" the album, had put him on the cover of \\"Time\\" and \\"Newsweek\\" the same week in October, 1975, one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story.<br /><br />The publicity and hype generated by Columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash:  \\"Nobody can be that good.\\"<br /><br />So here we see his first show ever in the UK, playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics, people thinking, \\"hey, 'Rock and Roll Future,' this is the land of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who - who do you think you're kidding.  No unknown kid from America deserves 'Time' and 'Newsweek.'\\"<br /><br />The show begins in almost total darkness, a piano softly plays, then harmonica, and a soft spotlight lights the kid from New Jersey who sings \\"Thunder Road,\\" accompanied by only piano.  An unknown song at the time, \\"Thunder Road\\" has become a Springsteen classic.  IMHO, especially given the expectations, it is a perfect understated opening.<br /><br />The DVD has the entire show, including everything from the hard rock of \\"She's the One,\\" and \\"Born to Run,\\" the song, to a much slowed down version of \\"For You,\\" an underated sleeper on his first album, \\"Greeting From Asbuty park, NJ.\\"  Bruce accompanies himself on the piano and I swear, this version of \\"For You\\" is so beautiful it could be the scruffy New Jersey kid channeling god.<br /><br />Any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking Springsteen was merely hype has no ears, no taste, or was xenophobic.  The show gives more than a big hint that this Springsteen guy is for real, as a songwriter and performer, and that \\"Born to Run,\\" especially, is an extraodinary album. There are only eight songs, but none are fill.  Repeated listenings of the four corners of the album (before CDs) \\"Backstreets,\\" \\"Jungleland,\\" Thunder Road,\\" and the title song are so good they become... well, addictive, works of genius, and lead to still more listening.  \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,\\" \\"Night,\\" and especially \\"She's the One\\" could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album.  Even the whispered \\"Meeting Across the River,\\" fits and helps the album become a coherent whole.  The songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts.<br /><br />As a footnote I'll offer the opinion that Bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as \\"Born to Run\\" and that is his next one, \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\"  Everything he has released is good;  a good bit of it is great, but I don't think anything else matches \\"Born To Run\\" or \\"Darkness.\\"  I don't know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released.<br /><br />The DVD of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock's greatest performer.

B000062YAZ|5.0|These guys are my second favorite of the big four of thrash(Megadeth is on top of course). Tom Araya's powerful wails are combined with his haunting, morbid lyrics. His basslines are pretty good too, and they keep the intensity going. Kerry King...ah yes. The solo in Angel of Death is proof of his talent. Jeff Hannemann is good as well, but he's no match for Kerry. Dave's drumming is intense and powerful, and he can really eat up the double bass. This CD is definately a must buy.

B000EGCITG|5.0|What I mean by that is, her first album she did called \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" had songs that sound more like hip/hop r&b. Like Pink was a black woman. Songs like \\"Most Girls\\", \\"There You Go\\", and some others. That's how she started out but as she got famous and did other ablums her songs sound different more like alternative rock. It's ok to change your image a little bit but she should think how she got famous. This ablum \\"I'm Not Dead\\", with the song \\"Stupid Girl\\" is a great hip/hop dance. I mean that's the Pink we remember when she made her debute. I wish this ablum was sold at Wal-Mart, like they can't sell cds with the [Parential Advisory]logos.
B000BMSU68|5.0|Supposedly for kids, this film will appeal to the kids in all of us. We started laughing out loud from the beginning scene and didn't stop until the end. Some of the scenes require more than a willing suspension of disbelief, but isn't that what comedy is all about?
0743457900|4.0|I did enjoy reading TTSS because of all the intricate details and I'm sure it was breaking new ground when written (well thats been proven false by my update by a TV show from 1965, see my update below about Danger Man) exposing the extreme paranoia that spies face. However, it seems so obvious to me now but never occurred to me until this \\"leak\\" in the CIA got busted (a disgruntled liberal who was clearly exposed and resigned, in 2006 I believe), why didn't they use lie detector tests in the agency? No mention of that option is revealed in the book. Also I guess I was expecting something more of an exciting ending, the realistic nature of the story telling (albeit no lie detector tests in this spy world), led to a mundane ending. A thinking mans spy novel until you start to think too much about it.       UPDATED April 2007      I just watched a Danger Man (AKA Secret Agent) episode called \\"Don't Nail Him Yet\\". In it is a foreign office's mole (ie a traitor), Stalinists (ie a Canadian liberal traitor), homosexual tendencies, a chase scene that eerily reminded me of the chase scene through the department store in this book, and John Drake (the actor Patrick McGoohan) saying the infamous line \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier....\\". This was done in 1965 and HAD to be a big inspiration for this book. I wonder if the author was ever asked this question or ever acknowledged it? Takes it down just a slight bit more in my book, but you intellectuals can keep raving about it. I still say, lie detectors, lie detectors, lie detectors. Oh and by the way, the Danger Man episode was AWESOME, a much more thriling ending than this book's!
B00005JOWR|5.0|When I first heard of thank you for smoking the title turned me off. I'm a nonsmoker and I think like most people? that cigarettes are death sticks. Once I saw the trailer I was more interested because it looked pretty funny and Aaron Eckhart is an actor I find interesting. I watched the movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it, it was quite funny and it also makes you think about the issue. What it came down to was would you make something harmful illegal or would you let each person make that choice for themselves. I believe in the latter.
B000E33VWW|3.0|Selecting the final segment in the life of author Truman Capote, the film \\"Capote\\", delves into the inner and certainly troubled soul of the American Novelist. The film itself, is a somber reflection of the price Capote paid to write what appears to be his most poignant work. The introduction of the book and the movie itself invites the audience into the real life drama of the Kansas family who were brutally murdered by two killers named Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins) in 1963. Along the way, one observes how adroitly, the writer is able to weave his tapestry between truth and fiction to achieve his ultimate goal. With the help of an assortment of great actors, such as Bruce Greenwood (Jack Dunphy) and Chris Cooper, Alvin Dewey) the film exhibits the enormous talent, and human flaws which made Capote a household word. Like an excellent novel, the movie is slow to build, but eventually achieves a touching tribute to the man.     This is your comment, you may delete or edit it.

0393317552|4.0|... tending to agree with what Agnew said below, that it wasn't just geography (though Diamond makes a pretty darn convincing argument that geography is a serious factor) but also the human factor. <br /> <br />There is no real argument with the idea that European and Asian immune systems were built up due to the encounter with so many germs, and that this certainly provided a seemingly divine shield when the Spanish went to South America and destroyed the natives, while remaining relatively immune to any South American illnesses (which Diamond explains in his geographical thesis). The book should be read for the presentation of this theory alone. It will resonate in your mind. <br /> <br />To say that geography is the only reason for all of history is, to me, faulty, however. Too many human variables are in the mix. The decisions that rulers make. The smarts of military leaders. The religion of the people. Also, the unpredictability of the human soul, which can change so much and affect the future in ways that no computer could calculate. The human race is too complex, and as a result the decisions, inventions, and innovations are also complex, and stem from more than simply the latest the availability of edible and/or usable resources. <br /> <br />Diamond is a brilliant writer and his book reads easily. It certainly is an important work. I just find that many brilliant theorists tend to make a my-way-or-the-highway claim when they present their theory. Geography may be a highly influential factor, but its not the only one.
B000E5N62U|3.0|My first reaction on listening to the entire CD was: A dozen years' wait for this?<br /><br />The good news is that the album is technically perfect and it's better than 90% of the garbage you'll hear on Clearchannel or Entercomm radio stations.<br /><br />The bad news is that the album is only 52 minutes long and doesn't offer anything Fagen hasn't already done better on Kamakiriad or Two Against Nature. While I wasn't expecting anything like the days of Skunk Baxter Steely Dan or even The Nightfly, I was expecting to hear some new ideas after more than a dozen years.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|... terrible movies the year it was released, Peter Jackson's King Kong showed every other movie director how to make a quality product. Entertaining through and through, this King Kong is a great update of a Hollywood classic like everyone is saying. But it's more than that.  <br /> <br />There is a scene where Kong is standing in a valley of skeletons - other members of his own species which have fallen vcictim to either the island's other predators or to time itself. It's a simple and beautiful scene, and shows Kong's strength as a survivor, while at the same time revealing his own sadness. The fact that this kind of pity can emanate from a CGI creation is tribute to PJ and to the actor playing Kong (the same actor who gave Gollum life in LOTR.) <br /> <br />I kept thinking of that scene when I watched Kong trying to cope with the new jungle he was taken to. Our jungle of New York circa Great Depresseion. Just as dangerous, with cars instead of dinosaurs and planes instead of bats. And the predator known as the human race.  <br /> <br />I can't wait for Peter Jackson to start making other, more serious movies like historical epics or great dramas (without big apes). Not only do I think he'll do a better job than someone like Ridley Scott, but his two main talents, for visuals and inspiring emotion, will definitely be put to great use.
B0009NZ3BO|2.0|I just got this CD yesterday and am terribly disappointed. Whoever mixed this remaster screwed up in a huge way.  Gary Green's guitar tracks are mostly missing from the album.  Sure there's some there on Give it Back and Empty City, but most of the rest is entirely absent.  The guitar solos are mostly there, but they are sometimes painfully loud and harsh. <br /> <br />The CD also has a rather bland sound stereophonicly (or is it even in stereo?).  The sound quality could also have benefitted from more treble / high end frequency response, but that's a complaint I've had about some of the other releases as well. <br /> <br />You'd think that DRT would have better quality control.  At the very least, someone with some knowledge of music should of at least listened to thing before distributing it. <br />
6305014140|5.0|Ninja Scroll is by far the best anime movie ever made to date. The story, characters, and action are all top notch and come togather to form an unforgetable experiance. This is the kinda movie that could cost 80 dollars and would still be a bargin. It has the right mix of story and action. It brings you into it's world of danger and deciet, and pulls no punches when it comes to violence. Theres also a constant theme of a woman's inferiority to man and her place in society, which is a refreshing change to all the BS that's flooding the T.V these days.This is definatly one of my top 5 movies of all time and the best anime movie I've ever seen. The only problem for fans of the genre is after watching this, no other anime will ever quite live up to it
0143036742|4.0|I found this book quite refreshing after a couple of recent bad picks. It concerns a love-sick (or lust-sick) 84 yr old male immigrant from the Ukraine who is marrying a thirty-four yr old immigrant who merely wants money and a British passport (in no particular order). The man's two daughters, now grown up in Britain with families of their own, are obviously very against the woman and the marriage. That's the humour side of it. There is a darker side to the story shown as flashbacks to the man and one of his daughters earlier lives in the Ukraine but not too much- just enough to give depth to things. The book is an easy read, a page turner, refreshingly different and delves into subjects like relationships between siblings and dotty old parents. I would highly recommend it.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|PRO: <br />First, the acting too me was overall great work. Penn might have seem to have overacted, but it fit his character well (an ex-convict who loses somthing precious (his daughter) while trying to live a straight life). Robbins has the tougher character of trying to find peace in his life as he continues to struggle w/ coming to terms w/ his past (being sexually abused). Dave (Robbins) is basically slowly dying (methaporically) but still has some hope in overcoming his problems. So Robbin's character is very psycological and depressing and Robbins does a great job. Bacon's character was more dull. His wife left him and he's just trying to get her back. He's tough and seem to have good morals (is a good cop and even rejects a coworker's advances). <br /> <br />Second, the directing to me was fine. Nothing special. It got to the point and told the story nicely. But Eastwood seem to get more praise for the fact that he's a legendary actor then skill.  <br /> <br />Third, the initial setup of the movie is great. Central to the storyline is basically the friendship of the 3 boys (Penn, Robbin, Bacon) and how they each had to endure the hardship of that tragic day. Mainly Robbins who remain traumatized. W/ the death of Penn's daughter, Robbins (the main suspect) descending towards insanity and w/ the cops (Bacon and Fisburne) and Penn slowly unravelling the murder, the build up was great.  <br /> <br />CON: <br />No Central Theme or Morals <br />The movie tries to focus on the three main characters and how they were each affected by the tragedy but eventually it becomes obvious that its mainly about Penn and Robbins. Bacon wasnt that integral to the storyline. Penn was built up like a hero and you sympathize w/ him because of the grief he was experiencing. On the other spectrum the movie starts to make Robbins darker. The movie wants you to think Robbins is evil and capable of evil because he was sexually abused. Robbins' becomes almost unbearable to watch (great acting job) in a sense that hes overwrought w/ guilt and imprisoned by his own consciousness and memory. So you go from feeling sympathetic for Robbins to disgust.  <br /> <br />But in the end it is Penn who is the evil one: a)winds up mistakenly kill Robbins and b) as we learn more about his past we find out he wasnt just a thief but a murderer too. Robbins resembles more of a hero when he confronts a pedophile in the act but wound up killing him (released his built up frustration and anger of not having a childhood). So although he unknowingly killed the pedophile he had the good intention and bravery of stopping the pedophile (confronting his past).  <br /> <br />So what exactly is the point of this movie? Penn seeks his own justice and kills the wrong man. Robbins is overcomed by his past and leaves him alienated from his own family. He holds all of the memories and anything related to it in his mind as to protect his family from the evils of child abuse. So in a sense Robbins is like a martyr but in the end there is absolutely no sense of justice.  <br /> <br />Penn gets off scot-free because Bacon as an ode to their friendship looks the other way. Bacon's character throughout the film was seen as a pretty decent guy but in the last act he becomes evil for this decision. The blood of Robbins is on both Penn and Bacon's hands. This is suppose to be a movie about the friendship of 3 young boys?  <br /> <br />The ending is absolutely horrible and made no sense. Forget about morals. Penn feels some remorse but his stupid wife (Laura Lindsey) makes him out to be a hero? What?? Just because he loves and protects his daughters he's a good father but yet he just killed a little boy's father. What is going on here? Then w/ the stupid parade at the end, everyone is happy except for Robbin's wife (who is the only character feeling guilty for not trusting her husband and leaving him when he needed her the most)and son (in a very sad scene at the parade). Bacon is happy because he's reunited w/ his estranged wife and baby. And he gives Penn a gesture as if to say everything is fine now. And why would the movie end w/o Robbins' wife confronting Penn and Lindsay? The conflict isnt over. Penn did an evil deed and goes unpunished again (he's killed b4 too).  <br /> <br />I watched the movie and expect more from the ending. When the final shot of the actual Mystic River came up i just had a great sense of emptiness. Much like the river the movie became transparent and underneath the river lied many horrors which the movie became. I expected a lot more from this movie. The ending was pretty dumb esp finding out that it was just 2 stupid boys acting like retards w/ a loaded gun? Even in tv shows like Law
B00008H2LB|4.0|Overall the album was good, but I was disappointed in some of the songs. <br /> <br />1. Foreword - Who really cares? Just a small short introduction. <br />2. Don't Stay - At first I didn't like this song. It just sounded like they couldnt think of anything good so they made it very similar to 'One Step Closer'. It grew on me though. (8/10) <br />3. Somewhere I Belong - Instant Hit! Probably the second best of all of them. (10/10) <br />4. Lying From You - This was once my favorite song on the album. It's still good, you can just get sick of it really fast. (7/10) <br />5. Hit The Floor - Sick. This song shames the name of Linkin Park. I cannot believe they even thought to put this on. (2/10) <br />6. Easier to Run - This was also once one of my favorites. Now it is just as bad as Hit The Floor. This song is nothing but a bunch of repeated rap lyrics and a boring chorus. (3/10) <br />7. Faint - Ahhh...probably the 4th best song on the album. This song combines the awesome power of Shinoda's lyrics and Bennington's vocals. (10/10) <br />8. Figure.09 - This is an o.k. song. More often I find myself hitting the skip button than actually listening to it. (7/10) <br />9. Breaking The Habit - This is probably the third best. Breaking the Habit is one of the few songs in which you will not hear Mike Shinoda's voice, making this song different. (in a good way) (10/10) <br />10. From The Inside - This song i find is very similar to Easier to Run, which is not a good thing. The song, once again, is just a lot of repeating the same lyrics 2 or 3 times. (3/10) <br />11. Nobody's Listening - I have found most people do not like this song. I also mark it as one of my favorites, probably the fifth. (9/10) <br />12. Session - An awesome instrumental. Probably better than Cure For The Itch. (9/10) <br />13. Numb - This takes the cake. My vote for LP's best song ever. It makes a great ending to any album...no matter how disappointed you were about it. (10/10) <br /> <br />Many Linkin Park fans would find this album to be good, and for those of you who do, it is worth your money. I do not regret purchasing this album and never will. The one downside besides a couple of songs would have to be the short length.
B00005JOE8|4.0|V for Vendetta will not be a film that everyone will see. It is, however, a film that everyone SHOULD see. <br /> <br />If this film didn't have source material that it is fairly faithful to, I'd say that the filmmakers wrote the script based on events of the last five years. That's how timely it is. <br /> <br />Known to the public as a terrorist, V, is a man who dons a Guy Fawkes mask and costume and attempts to bring about a revolution in a near-future England. Along the way he befriends a young woman - Evey (Natalie Portman) - who inadvertantly becomes his friend. <br /> <br />V for Vendetta is a very British film and that is a good thing. The cast is very British and very well schooled in their craft as character actors. As a result, the film is exciting, clean, crisp, and invigorating when it should be and dramatic and engaging when it should be. <br /> <br />The script is tight and well written. The content....well, it's amazing how timely it truly is. <br /> <br />V is the ultimate anti-hero. Sure, he is acting outside the law and performing acts that would constitute terrorism, but we must remember that the U.S. was founded on similar acts: the Boston Tea Party, the Revolutionary War, etc. <br /> <br />This film is about change and how it is necessary for people to take their blinders off and see what is wrong in the world and actively participate in making the change come about. <br /> <br />Amazing film!

B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hostel is a gore fest that dares you to not turn away from the screen. <br /> <br />As MODERN horror films goes, this is above average. As horror films go, it is below average. This is a far superior film to say....Friday the 13th, but a pitiful film in comparison to the German film \\"M\\" (from 1933). Why? Because MODERN horror films don't actually use HORROR (definition: creating a sense of fear or dread), but rather go for the cheap scare: gore and shock. Bill Cosby once said, \\"It is very easy to get people to laugh at dirty jokes, because they make them uncomfortable. It is much more difficult to get people to laugh at clean humor.\\" The same can be said for gore and shock. It is much easier to get a reaction to them than it is to create an overall sense of fear and dread. <br /> <br />Hostel, at times, does create a sense of fear and dread, but not in its scenes of gore and torture, but rather in the anticipation of those scenes. <br /> <br />Two American college aged young men and one man a bit older (from Iceland) are partying hard in Amsterdam as they backpack across Europe. They admit to having no interest in seeing the sites, but rather in being as randy as possible and participating in as many acts of debauchery that they can. This is the first mistake of the filmmakers. Since the three lead characters are not morally redeemable, it is hard to feel sympathy for them...with possibly one exception: Josh (Derek Richardson). Josh is quite possible a virgin and his friend Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is making it his job to see to it that Josh gets \\"lucky\\". While he does, in fact, get lucky, it would seem that Josh very possibly has feelings for Paxton beyond just good friends. When Josh gets bumped off, his is the only character we feel sympathy for. <br /> <br />While in Amsterdam, the guys find out that there is a youth hostel in Slovakia where the women will do anything sexual with anyone who wants it. Lame premise...but supportive of the naive and stupid tourists who would believe that anything goes in a former Soviet block country. <br /> <br />This is possibly the film's greatest strength. It capitalizes on the uneasy and unsure subconscious fears of the Western world regarding the old Soviet block countries. Sure, they're the new \\"wild west\\" where anything goes, but that can also include the bad with the good.  <br /> <br />The three guys head to Slovakia and this \\"hostel not in any guide book\\". When they arrive, the hostel appears to be more like a four or five star hotel where they have to share their room with three beautiful girls who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat. In fact, the first half of the film is a veritable \\"boob fest\\" in that more women run around topless in this than in most hard core porn films. <br /> <br />The guys get lucky immediately, but because we know that the hostel is is front for something far more sinister, we are actually allowed to fear for the characters just what is going to become of them. This is the one factor of the advertising campaign for this film that does its job. <br /> <br />Once the second half of the film begins, the story switches to a very gory version of \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", where men pay big money to torture, mutilate and kill other humans.  <br /> <br />I don't think I've given too much away, but to tell more would be giving away the simple plot. Is there redemption? I'll let you be the judge. Is it more than a simple gore film? Not really. Is it amateurish? No. The acting is decent and the scenery and the special effects are quite....realistic. <br /> <br />The DVD has almost no extras beyond various commentaries. This isn't Citizen Kane, so I just wanted to watch the film. Thus this sort of \\"extra\\" is, to me a waste of time - ego stroking on the part of those involved. <br /> <br />It's an inevitable film. One that will surely have sequels. And since you know you'll want to see them, go ahead and get this film.

0870703781|5.0|this is where color photography became art, and it is the MOST influential color work done to date. what can you say about this work except that if you are a photography student, lover, practitioner, or simple fan, you must own this book. this is the one folks, where it all began. giving it stars seems silly, but if ever there was a 5 star book, this is it.
6305971099|4.0|after the suprise hit of 4 we were given 5 one year later. it makes use of older horror movies (bride of frankenstein at the begining) and really becomes a fun if still slasher movie.donald pleasence is back still mad as ever dr. lommis or is that capt. ahab looking to end michael's terror once and for all. as the fourth movie ended with the possiable end of michael and his niece being the new killer it is shocking to see that michael is back and his niece is in a home after attacking her foster mother with a knife. <br />   a little more style and once again not as much gore make this entry into the series much better than most of the others. the only draw back is the ending that sets up a sequel that never really comes to pass.
1931788340|5.0|this is one of the first great works of color photography, and is still as fresh and significant as it was 30 years ago. forget all the imitators of today's contemporary scene, this was one of the first and is still better than anything to come along since (with the exception of sternfeld's american prospects which is equally great).  <br /> <br />and for those who say this is snapshot photography, think again. view camera, deliberation, and intent here are razor sharp and NOT filled with accidents or casual images.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|The reviewers who gave this film low marks are entitled to their opinion as I am entitled to mine. The initial urge to criticize this film dissipated after glancing at a quick second showing. It is not required that a movie be perfect in order for it to be perfected within itself given the constraints of various limitations. Those who cry foul and point to inaccurate text mirroring or cite smidglings of literary discrepancies seem to have bones too stiff for enjoyment. Although it is possible (usually in most films it is not only possible, but probable, that different actors may have carried success to further extreme - or inversely, failure), it seems pointless to snivel about it. We have these actors - these particular combinations - no others. This film came into a life of its own and spoke well to the human condition. The acting, overall, was excellent and in several instances phenomenal. Quite a wonderful pleasure. We would certainly be the poorer without it.

B00004VXF2|5.0|This CD is THE MOST POPULAR at water aerobics classes (whose typical member is over age 50), and has been for a several weeks. It is even more popular than both \\"Abba Gold\\" and the \\"Hooked on Classics\\" series. <br />I've lent this CD Series to so many water aerobic instructors (four different ones), for so many days, that I've actually purchased second copies, something I've done with no other CD. <br /> <br />So, why this popularity? Possibly because: (1) The music is positive/upbeat, (2) the variety, and (3) the excellent sound quality. If you know why the popularity, please tell me.
B00005JOI3|5.0|I guess I could say that I now finally understand this film. As one reviewer stated, this film has to do with a man dying on a road but as he is dying his mind recreates a reality that changes life's events and nothing seems to makes sense. I'm glad I didn't know this before watching the film because otherwise it may not have been so much fun trying to figure out what was real or not. I would have simply said to myself, \\"Oh, that's just his subconcious crossing over to his conscious mind. Nothing is going to make any sense.\\" Or, \\"fasten your seatbelts, because the subconscious mind is one bumpy illogical road.\\" In getting back to the actual reason for these minsconstrued events, when it comes to the human mind, there are NO limits, no barriers. The subconscious mind still baffles even the most astute psychiatrists. So when you take a man who has had a trauma to his brain and it starts hemmorhaging one cannot argue the possibilities of what will occur in his head. Tapping into memories, and very uncomfortable emotions like guilt and fear, the sky's the limit.  <br />I enjoyed the movie's visuals. Most people haven't even commented on the designs of most scenes. All the mid century mod-like furnishings were gorgeous. A lot of effort was put into creating all of this. <br />Back to other details. I noticed that Ewan's character was wearing \\"flood-like\\" pants but I thought he was just odd and quirky that way. Just like the people who actually did wear pants that way back in the 70's. But to now read about it by other reviewers as to why this was the case makes me think, 'how clever!' And the movie just keeps unraveling for me weeks later and I keep on thinking about it.  The title for this film is very appropriate as I keep pondering this film weeks later.  <br />One thing I found very intriguing had to do with Naomi's character and how she changed \\"careers\\" within a matter of minutes. Those of you who have seen this film know what I am talking about. I wonder, since this is all coming from the dying mind of Gosling's character, if this was his method of projecting his self hatred onto others and seeing them in the same light. But only, however, to change the facts (or to simply make yourself believe something else) that very moment right before you die. Did he purposely cause that car wreck that killed everyone in it or was it a blown tire and simply an accident? If it wasn't an accident, no wonder the phrase \\"forgive me\\" was written on the wall several thousand times. Did Naomi's character really try to commit suicide? Remember, in one scene she said something to the effect of, \\"I wonder if people will remember me.\\" She was doubting her value as a human being and thought she didn't mean much.  But towards the end she's now a nurse? Does that mean that nurses are more memorable than suicidal artists, or more valued? Was her being a suicidal artist simply a reflection (or rather a projection) of himself for those few last moments while dying on that bridge?  <br />This is why I liked the movie so much. It doesn't really have closure. Not much really makes sense. But it is an idea, a concept and I enjoy thinking about the possibilities as to how the human mind operates. I don't need a perfectly told story nor a perfect ending for a movie to get 5 stars in my book. In real life, not everything makes sense. This movie is like a well done painting by a very complex artist. As you study it and get feedback from others you continue to get more from it and understand it. <br />As Bob Hoskin's character said, \\"The Buddists had it right all along! This world is nothing but an illusion.\\" I couldn't agree more.

She's thoroughly self-absorbed and superficial -- judging herself and everyone else based on looks, clothing, money, etc.  The book begins when her world starts to crumble -- she finds her fiance in his boxers at her best friend's house.  But don't feel sorry for Darcy, she's not any better herself.  And to top it off, she's pregnant -- but not by her fiance.  So Darcy is facing the kind of crisis that can make or break her.  She quits her job and moves to London, for what she tells her unwilling host will be a short visit, even though she has other plans.  Yes, Darcy is a user, but over the course of the book, begins to change. <br /> <br />I found the transformation a bit incredible (well, more than a bit), and I also found her handling of money a bit incredible (is she totally detached from reality?)  But it's an entertaining story, easy to read, and makes you smile from time to time as you are asked to see the world from Darcy's point of view even though you know differently.  When she says she doesn't judge people by their shoes any more, you know she still does or it wouldn't be on her mind. <br /> <br />This is the second book telling about the same characters -- I'd like to go back and read the first, which tells the story from the viewpoint of another character. <br /> <br />Not Pulitzer prize winning material, perhaps, but it will probably hold your attention very well.
B00003CX95|5.0|It seems incredibly remiss of me not to have reviewed one of my favorite movies, a definite Oscar-winning `Desert Island' disc of mine.  As an early adopter of the DVD format it was a movie that I eagerly awaited on the shiny little discs, there was even a Web site launched by another fan with the sole express purpose of pressuring the studio into releasing the movie on the format. Thankfully Paramount relented in 2000 and finally released the movie and I was there the day it came out to eagerly snatch up my copy.<br /><br />The historical inaccuracies have been well documented in the past. Very little is known of the background to William Wallace, and what we do know comes mainly from an oral history originating after his death. Even what we do know is not translated accurately into the film. Perhaps the most glaring example of this is the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which is portrayed here without the bridge. This is seen as critical by historians since the bridge played a role in the Scottish victory.<br /><br />However, as screenwriter Randall Wallace (who had never heard of his famous ancestor until a fateful trip to Scotland)  said in a HISTORY channel documentary on the movie, the script holds true to the spirit of the Wallace history and technical issues finally proved prohibitive to filming the battle as it happened.<br /><br />The movie follows the story of William Wallace who led his native Scots in a revolt against the English King Edward the Longshanks  (played with wonderful villainous relish by Patrick McGoohan).  In an effort to \\"breed\\" out the Scots, Edward re-instigates an old practice whereby the English Lord blesses a marriage by taking the newly wed bride into his bed on the wedding night.<br /><br />Not willing to accept this Wallace and his bride (played by the impossibly beautiful Catherine McCormack) wed in secret. Then shortly after Wallace feels compelled to protect her from the lecherous advances of one of the Kings men, an action which leads to his bride being murdered by the  English.<br /><br />The reaction by Wallace is swift and brutal, and the Scots march down into England to wreak revenge on their occupiers.  Some of the violence is very graphic with heads getting lobbed off and severed arms spurting blood, but the graphic depiction of violence is necessary given that battles in that time were usually fought in close proximity and were violent.<br /><br />It's a story that I, as a native Scot, feel close to my heart and one that no doubt  left an impact on the voters of Scotland who finally voted  in the 1990s to partially secede from the United Kingdom to the extent that they now have their own parliament and are in control of most of their domestic policy.<br /><br />Perhaps surprising given his stature as one of Hollywood's leading men, Gibson handles his directorial duties expertly and in fact was recognized by the Academy in 1996 with a Best Director Oscar. He manages to weave together all the elements in what was a gigantic undertaking and gets fantastic performances from all involved.<br /><br />Special features on this DVD include a rather short behind-the-scenes featurette that includes shots of the Irish army dressing up as Scottish soldiers (yes, it was inexplicably filmed in Ireland and Scotland) , casting the movie (Gibson quite understandably was enchanted  by McCormack's beauty) and problems they had in the making of the movie. There is also a rather breezy commentary by Gibson that I liked with only one exception. My favorite dialogue in the movie is the stirring pep talk given to his troops by Wallace before engaging the English, however in the commentary Gibson talks right through it. Still it's great to have the commentary on the disc, which was released at a time when star commentaries were rare.<br /><br />Overall then, the movie is an inspiring tale of courage and love. It's well worth giving it a spin in your DVD player and clocking in at three-hours well worth the price.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Usually actors of such talent are not equally talented as singers, but in this case Phoenix and Witherspoon sang so beautifully I was convinced that they were dubbed.  I also came away thinking that Witherspoon deserved her Oscar but Phoenix was robbed of his, because they both put in Oscar-winning performances.  If I could have changed this movie in any way, however, I would have focussed a bit less on the romance between Carter and Cash (it more or less was the whole movie) and told the whole story of Cash more -- we get some insight into his childhood and why he was such prone to self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, but the rise from door-to-door salesman to megastar was glossed over.  I suspect it wasn't that sudden.
B0009WK5D6|4.0|Well, too bad the UMD format is not popular with PSP owners. It seems that some Movie companies will stop producing them soon.  Ohh, well.  I love this format.<br /><br />This movie is really very raunchy and funny. It is a great movie for young men and women, feeling the frustration of teen angst, and sexually charged situations.  I loved it.<br /><br />I'd also like to give props to the producers for including some (if not all, I'm not sure, as I never saw the DVD release) of the special features, which is a rarity on this format.  I hope more companies take note of this.<br /><br />Great effort on this UMD!!!
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is truly a novel of unfound proportions. It plays on the juxtaposition of naivety and wisdom, truth and faith, struggle and redemption, and most importantly, good and evil. Within the given boundaries of 600 pages, Steinbeck explores the psychological and mental desires of everybody, while also enlightening the readers with a theory on the purpose of life and its attributes. <br /> <br />The main storyline follows the vicious cycle of two generations of siblings in the Trask family, while also playing on the biblical reference to the stories of Cain and Abel, and Caleb and Aron. The two set of brothers, who set the stage for the novel, are always in conflict with one another in their desire to gain the love of their fathers. In its exploration of their interaction with the people around them and with their fathers, Steinbeck uses the brothers in order to explain life as the Bible does. He directly calls upon the stories in the vastly popular book in order to expound on God's meaning of life as it pertains to society and how people should view their lives in respect to others. He creates a whole commonalty of characters that help extenuate and expose the interactions of people and their effects. Cathy, another important figure in the book, is Steinbeck's way of placing evil in a light that takes a tangible form. Cathy is one character alone that while she amazes and builds suspense for the reader, she also disgusts and shocks the reader with her cunning ability to manipulate people at the lift of a finger. Her evil genius is solely a product of her desires: to get out of work in dismissing responsibility, to subjugate blame, and gain an enormous control over people. Steinbeck also delves into the meaning of life and how it is defined completely on the ability of choice. He acquaints the readers with the word \\"timshel.\\" Etymologically speaking, the Hebrew word directly translates to \\"thou mayest,\\" which Steinbeck uses to express his viewpoint on choice. He tells the reader that only he has the ability to choose the path of his life, and it is he who can conquer sin and break from past trends. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the book brings out the true battle of good and evil as the Bible interprets it, and reveals the true definition of life. As Steinbeck explores the issues that surround life in terms of faith, trust, and love, he creates an unbelievable book, despite its licentiousness, that leaps out of the boundaries delineated by society. The characters, the themes, the story itself, all of it comes together, creating a momentous book by all standards.
0307276902|4.0|I began reading the book \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" for a graduate class.  I probably would not have chosen this book to read on my own, however I am so glad that I had the opportunity to read it.  I knew going into the book the controversial issues that were going on, but I was determined not to let that ruin my perspective or enjoyment.  I truly enjoyed this book.  James Frey has an awesome writing style.  I loved the fact that I felt as if I were right there taking every step with him.  I loved how he was very detailed and was not scared to hold back his emotions. I loved the suspensefullness of never knowing what he might do next.  I can truly see how this book could help those struggling with a drug addiction.  Great book to read.
B00003CX95|5.0|Freedom has always been something man has fought for since the beginning of time.  Freedom from those who would oppress us in every way, from the way we dress, to what we are allowed to believe, even where we are allowed to live, we have always wanted the freedom to choose and to live as we see fit.  In the Revolutionary War, our ancestors that settled here to form the 13 colonies chose to rebel against the oppresive forces of England that had enslaved them all their lives.  Centuries before our ancestors fought for our freedom, Scotland was fighting for theirs from England, and even to this day that fight still continues to some degree.  To bring the story of Scotland's fight for freedom to the big screen, writer Randall Wallace got the attention of Paramount Pictures and Icon Productions who liked the idea, and with Mel Gibson attached to direct and star, everything else just seemed to fall into place for the dark ages epic \\"Braveheart\\". <br /> <br />\\"Braveheart\\" is the story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a brave Scotsman who has been lured from his quiet life, when the regional governor kills his wife (Catherine McCormack), to wage war on his country's oppressors.  Using his now famous longsword, fiery rage, and cunning intellect to rally his countrymen to fight for liberation against the King of England (Patrick McGoohan) and his vast army.  Wallace will not rest until Scotland is free or he is dead. <br /> <br />This epic film is filled with gigantic battle sequences that accurately depict the brutal, up-close nature of war before there were guns or cannons, when the only way to fight was with swords and bows and arrows.  Expertly directed by Mel Gibson (at this time Mel had only directed one other film \\"The Man Without a Face\\", most recently he directed the critically acclaimed \\"Passion of the Christ\\"), with brilliant acting by the entire cast including Mel Gibson, who of course had nothing but the best to work with in terms of story, as it was carefully crafted by Randall Wallace (screenwriter of \\"The Man in the Iron Mask\\").  \\"Braveheart\\" is definitely not a film to be missed by any fan of history or movies.  As a side note, Randall Wallace just so happens to be a descendant of William Wallace, which is why he was so interested in bringing this story to the big screen.   <br /> <br />If this review hasn't convinced you to see \\"Braveheart\\", then you should also know that the year it was released, 1995, it received 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, though sometimes that doesn't mean a film is necessarily enjoyable to watch, I guarantee with \\"Braveheart\\", the awards and accolades it received were well founded. <br /> <br />\\"Braveheart\\" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This is a great CD. I bought this CD not knowing quite what to expect. I had read the reviews and heard the hype and this is one time I am glad I listened to the critics because the CD is aweome.  The song titles are ridiculous and that is part of what makes this CD funny. When I tell people that one of my favorite songs is \\"Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking off her clothes\\" is great, because I usually get that crooked eyebrow/quizzical look. I then tell them to just buy the CD because they won't regret it. \\"I write sins not tragedies\\" is a great choice as the first single because the song sticks in my head long after I hear it. The video is great, if you haven't seen it download it immerdiately. It is one of the most original music videos out there. The CD has a neat almost carnival sound to most of the songs, that matches the carnival aspect of the video. The main downer of the CD is that I had a hard time understanding a lot of the words to the songs. Thankfully the book had the words to the songs so I could follow along and understand the song. Good CD to add to the collection though.
0446310786|5.0|Great classic book. No matter how the world changes, this story will always ring true. Easy read on a lazy afternoon. You'll fall in love with the characters.
B00004Y6NV|1.0|After releasing five great studio albums, Dire Straits released On Every Street which turned out to be its swan song. The album apart from Calling Elvis was awful. Heavy Fuel was a joke! This album only sold a fraction of what Brothers in Arms sold whilst Metallica's self-titled and Rush's Roll the Bones were slaughtering the competition. Even Pink Floyd's A Momentary Lapse of Reason is better than this!
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Ok I'm a very big Horror movie fan, <br />Saw, Saw 2, Texas chainsaw ect.... <br />This wasn't scarey, it was slightly gross... in places. But the movie trailer leads u to belive the whole movie is gross which it isn't. <br /> <br />The whole 1st hour is a waste. I mean yes you get to know the characters and feel for them but how bad can you feel for guys going to hook up with girls to just have sex? HAHA <br /> <br />Overall it was worth watching. I wouldn't buy it though. Wait for cable. <br /> <br />It did also have a twist at the end... it should have been talked about a few minutes more.  <br /> <br />And the end there is a justified action. Which was a nice ending.
B000002J0B|5.0|This is one Led Zeppelin's most diverse slabs of brilliance. I can listen to every song on this record, start to finish, any day of the week and not get a tad bored. The songs are thoughtful and well-crafted. Buy this immediately if you are a newbie.
0446605409|1.0|The plot (or lack of a plot) in this book in terrible.  It's more of a random set of spew typed into a word processor.  The book spends hundreds of pages describing an hour in time, has a bunch of random things happen, the 'I' character babbles semi-macho nonsense.<br /><br />I read 'Night Fall' first and figured, 'this author is popular, Night Fall must be an anomaly in badness.'  Nope, this book is almost as bad as 'Night Fall.'  It's a waste of paper and ink.<br /><br />The story has a bunch of important characters and threads that aren't resolved at the end.  The last 100 pages is just plain stupid... compared to the rest of the book which is a romp through the author/'I' character's self absorbed pointless meanderings.<br /><br />My wife kept asking, \\"if the book's so bad, why are you toturing yourself by reading it?\\"  \\"No book can be this bad... it's got to have an ending that makes the rest of the book worthwhile.\\"  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />There is nothing redeaming about this book.<br /><br />If you want the macho main character, go buy a Robert Parker book.  If you want a cop story, go buy a Michael Connoley book.  If you want the overly flip lead character, go buy a Robert Crais book.  Just don't waste your money on this book.
B00003CX5P|1.0|What was Lucas thinking, or was he thinking!!! I can't believe I kept looking at my watch to see how much more I had to endure. Is this really a Star Wars episode?! If boring wasn't enough... what's with the overt rascism in the characters... is this really a Star Wars episode?! George, are you still doing acid or are you just having flashbacks? <br /> <br />If no stars was an option that what I would have rated this film!!!!!!!!
0316172324|2.0|I can sum up this book in the following 3 points.   <br /> <br />1) the subconscious mind exists.   <br />2) Sometimes it can work for you, sometimes it can work against you.  <br />3) There is very little you can do about how it works. <br /> <br />The end.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|<br />I'm sorry to say that this movie was soooo bad, that it deserves -5 (negative five) stars; what I hated about the movie was that the first half was like Euro Trip (which was a good comedy) and the last half was like Saw, in other words a comedy and a horror movie mixed together in a bad way. The acting sucked! The villain was a wimp until the final scene! And overall this movie was gross and not scary! If you look for scary movies stick with: HALLOWEEN, HELLRAISER, THE FOG, STIGMATA, THE RING, THE EXORCIST, POLTERGEIST and JAWS 1+2, and if you are really looking for blood try THE DENTIST <br />
B000EHRVP6|1.0|With this movie? It was not scary, it had a few gross moments, too much unescessary nudity and sex that did nothing to move the story along. It was more humorous than anything else. Moral lesson, If you go to places like that seeking an anything goes sexual escapade than you get what you deserve.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|This is a dull movie that would have been better as a series of shorts. The whole thing goes back and forth between \\"humorous\\" and \\"serious\\" scenes, and you're never really sure what the movie is supposed to be about. You never care about any of the characters either - most of them are portrayed as drooling idiots when they're not spouting off dialogue that sounds like it was created by some sort of generic army talk generator. Worst of all is the soundtrack. Everybody Dance Now? Are you kidding me? It's like listening to a mixed tape made by someone who owns every volume of Now: The Hits.  Jarhead tries too hard to be deep, with its trippy visuals of burning oil wells and dramatic naratives, but by the time the film is over, absolutely nothing is said. Jarhead is just a wannabe war movie that even references Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter while ripping off Full Metal Jacket. Too bad because a good cast was wasted.
B000BTNIHW|2.0|This item would be very useful if it were better quality.  <br /> <br />I got one of these and noticed, after a short time of using it as a keychain, that it slowly leaks. I sent it back to Zippo and they replaced it for free, which is very cool of them, but the replacement they sent me has the same problem. Now I'm starting to think this problem is not specific to one canister. <br /> <br />So, if it didn't leak, it would be great. Since it leaks, I can't really use it for what I'm supposed to be able to use it for. I have to carry it upright all the time and I can't put it in my pocket, since I don't want my leg to catch on fire if I happen to be near an open flame. <br /> <br />Also, the \\"flint sleeve\\" on this thing is useless. You can put your flint into it, but it's very difficult to get it back out.
B0000CABBW|4.0|This film has a lot of heart, that's for sure.  Keisha Castle-Hughes gives an oscar worthy performance (maybe that's why she was nominated) and the film as a whole, while far from perfect, gives a whallop of a punch in the end.  The story of Pai, a young New Zealand girl who is hated then loved then hated again by her grandfather, is a truly heartfelt and moving story to say the least.  In their culture they believe that a firstborn son will become leader of the people.  The problem is that Pai's twin brother (who would in essence be the firstborn) died at birth and Pai, the daughter, was all that was left.  Her father, in haste and depression for losing not only his son but also his wife (she dies giving birth), leaves her in the custody of his parents.  His father is burdened by this and resents Pai for it, but as time passes he falls in love with her, until time comes for him to train the other firstborn SONS in the village for leadership and she tries to succeed herself.  The story is more a story of love than anything else.  Pai doesn't want to hurt her grandfather or defame her culture, she just wants to earn love and respect from her grandfather, a man whom she honors and respects and values dearly, loves as a she would love a father because he is the only father she's ever known.  There is a scene where she relates a spoken word essay about her culture and about her grandfather, and as she speaks in broken words and short breaths as tears fall down her face I (as well as my wife) were brought to tears for this beautiful girl, beautiful in both spirit and soul and that's what brings me to my title, Keisha Castle-Hughes, because simply put this young actress is astounding...she gave more heart in her performance then I've seen from a lot of leading ladies these days and so I am glad to see that she was honored by a nomination at such a young age.
B000B9NAL6|4.0|Based on a novel of the same name by John Buchan, The 39 Steps has Robert Donat pursued for a murder he didn't commit. Donat, who plays mining engineer Robert Hannay, finds himself unwillingly drawn into a chase across the Scottish moors in search of a man who he believes can clear him. Meantime, he narrowly escapes death and capture. Madeleine Carroll, a beautiful blonde, plays the romantic interest here. She almost gets Hannay killed, but in the end proves a valuable partner. <br /> <br />
B00001ZWTT|2.0|I don't know how a movie with so much going on can actually put me to sleep.  Oh, yeah, because what was going on was not even the least bit interesting.  Now I was shocked the feel this way, especially since Will Smith alone can carry a movie, but this film proved to be too much for even 'the greatest' himself.  In the ninties it seemed as if Will Smith was on top of the box office with smash after smash (Independence Day, Men in Black) but Wild Wild West can't even come close to compairing with those two films.  Hey, at least the soundtrack is tight.  Anyways, Will Smith plays Jim West and Kevin Kline plays Gordon and the two of them are sent to find some torso of a man who has kidnapped the worlds top scientists so that he can build a weapon to take over the USA.  So in the course of two hours time you see wierd gagets and loose women and some metal spider things and towns are destroyed and Will Smith dresses up like a woman (the best scene in the film) and really...thats all...I mean, the film itself has no substance.  Another pitfall is the fact that this film can't save itself from being corny...really really corny.  It falls into the same catagory as 'Men In Black 2'...stupid.  The difference between films like this and Will Smith's more successful efforts (Men in Black and Hitch) is that the comedy in those films was smart, not stupid...and the comedy here is just an agrivance.  Skip this one...it's not worth the agrivation.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Certain films just scream a purchase to me, even blind buys. The Fly and Dr Strangelove were pure blind buys and I didn't regret them. Sometimes though a film comes out and you just have to test the waters. Well going to the video store, I found out I got a free rental so I was very curious about Hostel so got that. Well, that saying of \\"I want those 90 minutes back\\" certainly applied to me. \\"Scariest movie in a decade\\"? Liars. <br /> <br />2 Americans and a Icelandic friend are in England backpacking looking for, what else? Women, particularly soon-to-be naked willing women. They overhear a story of a place that has incredibly easy girls who just love American accents. Well getting there, they meet 2 girls and soon they get suckered in to an odd place: people who pay to torture and kill people for a price, and wouldn't you know it? Americans fetch a mighty fine price. <br /> <br />Like Land of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, the Saw films and Wolf Creek, the film tries to horrify by showing disgusting images such as severed limbs or any other nasty business. Hostel doesn't delve into it right away but there's still a kind of pointless feel to it all. When the carnage starts happening, I can just imagine the filmmakers going nuts because they just wanted to make a violent movie. Gore can be used in a more artistic fashion such as war films but here it just feels violent just for the sake of it. <br /> <br />What piqued my interest was this guy at the college mentioned the film and one of the gory shots and a woman in the class said \\"every guy his age should see that film\\". Whether she meant it as \\"boys will be boys\\" who will see those nudity/violence filled movies or it shows commentary on a thing apparently guys love to do: go overseas and bed \\"hot European chicks\\". To be honest, I never was into that, preferring the romance and chase angle but this is a commentary and it's a well-told one at that, it's just too bad it's on a ridiculous and pointless movie. <br /> <br />If you want good horror movies, check out the Exorcist or the Shining or Carrie but if you're into gory stuff, you'll love it. Me? I want my free rental back.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|THE BAND: Gabriel has played with many session musicians over the decades... most notably on many of his solo records - David Rhodes (guitar), Tony Levin (bass), Jerry Marotta (drums), Manu Katche (drums), and Ged Lynch (drums). Gabriel himself is a master at many instruments - keyboards, piano, organ, mellotron, synth, synth bass, keyboard bass, Surdo drums, flute, recorder, various percussion, drum samples/loops/patterns. Guest artists on select tracks include Stewart Copeland, Phil Collins, Sinead O'Conner, Kate Bush, and Robert Fripp.<br /><br />THE DISC(S): (2003) 29 songs on 2 discs clocking in at approximately 151 minutes (Disc-1 is 76:01, Disc-2 is 74:35).

It's a worthy purchase, and if you're thinking about trading in your \\"Shaking The Tree\\" please reconsider. There are 4 tracks on \\"Shaking The Tree\\" that make it worth keeping in my book that you won't find here on \\"Hit\\". Listen, and then decide. With that being said - this \\"Hit\\" and \\"Miss\\" collection of Peter Gabriel is dead on accurate. Disc 1 (\\"Hit\\") contains the popular tunes that most listeners will recognize - \\"Solsbury Hill\\", \\"Shock The Monkey\\", \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"Red Rain\\", \\"Games Without Frontiers\\", \\"Big Time\\", \\"Steam\\", the Kate Bush ballad \\"Don't Give Up\\", etc. Disc 2 contains the deeper albums cuts that perhaps haven't made it to the FM airwaves - with the exception of \\"In Your Eyes\\" (one of his big hits from 1986's \\"So\\") that would have been better placed on disc 1. The only thing negative about this collection is that there are no track(s) from his 2nd solo album \\"Scratch\\" - surely something from this album should have been represented here (my choices would have been \\"D.I.Y.\\" or \\"Home Sweet Home\\"). The 2 unreleased songs are later era Gabriel gems. Gabriel is an island unto himself. His vocals instantly recognizable. His catalog is so different from anything else out there (his days with Genesis were equally unique). His songs are soulful, rhythmic, pop/rock and downright tribal at times. If you never knew which Gabriel studio album were perhaps the best (in my opinion he had two bests - \\"So\\" or \\"#3-Melt\\")... this definitive 2-disc \\"Hit\\" collection is THE place to start.

HIRED AS AN ADVISOR, HE WAS PUT IN THE MOVIE AFTER KUBRICK REALIZED THAT NOBODY CAN PLAY THAT ROLE THAT HAS NOT LIVED IT.  BRILLIANT MOVIE THAT DOESN'T PLAY ON YOUR EMOTIONS LIKE PLATOON OR ANY OTHER VIETNAM WAR MOVIE.  IT JUST SHOWS THE WAY IT IS FOR MARINES IN COMBAT AND THE LOVE THEY SHARE FOR EACH OTHER.

B0009UC7HA|4.0|Sahara, not to be confused with the 1943 Humphrey Bogart classic, starts off slow, but grows on you.  This 2005 film directed by Breck Eisner and starring Matthew McConauhey and Penelope Cruz is a treasure, mystery, spy, and adventure movie rolled into one action packed DVD.  Everyone does a good job.  The classic rock, pseudo-Bond soundtrack is annoying, but the Sahara desert backdrop draws you in.  A bit, violent, and maybe not for the small kiddies, but a good family film.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|Don't let the awful coverjacket fool you, this is the best movie of 2006.  All eyes were on Brokeback Mountain, another great film, but this is the Heath Ledger movie to watch -- and see what a great actor he is creating a totally different performance in the same year. <br /> <br />Any comparisons to shakespeare in love is ludicrous, this movie is so much better.  A great romantic comedy, a great comedy and a great movie period. <br /> <br />This movie is fun, heartwarming and hilarious.  I was completely surprised at how good this movie is and you will be too.   I've seen over a 100 movies last year and this tops my list.

This book keeps your attention and I would say that it makes reading fun. <br />
B000000I0I|5.0|I have been listening to this composition at suitable intervals for 30 years now.  Many of the reviewers here sound like this is about the best thing they've ever heard.  Count me in.  In one effort this album established the breadth of perspective of New Age music on par with classical music.  Hundreds of years from now when people want to hear only the best of our era, this work will be there.  Tubular Bells is Oldfield's wonderful if playful signature composition, but Ommadawn is his masterpiece.
0698119347|5.0|Alex had been told that his uncle, who was like a father to him had been killed in a car wreck.  Alex has a gut feeling that that is not what actually happened to his uncle, so he sneaks into the car impound lot to find the windshield of his car was full of bullet holes.  Then Alex is told that he must become a spy, and he gets sent to Sayle Enterprises, where he is nearly killed several times. <br /> Salye Enterprises is giving away computers to all of the schoolchildren. If Alex doesn't quickly uncover a deadly secret, it will cost him the life of all the school children in England. <br />I would give this book five stars, because it really draws you into it and makes you want to keep reading.  Once you're done you will want to read the next book in the series.  This book is full of action.  My dislike about this book is that a lot of the action seemed pretty fakey and if they ever tried to make a movie of  it probably wouldn't be very good. <br /> If you like James Bond or anything like that you will love this book. This book takes the Cody banks idea to the next level.  If you are into anything like that you will love this book.  <br />

Thanks Will,Grace,Karen and Jack for the laughs and now the memories.
B00005V0X5|5.0|The greatest album ever released... by anyone... EVER! I may be a little biased seen as I worship Megadeth and Sir Dave Mustaine... This is Megadeth's 1st ever release... this album (remastered) is the perfect example of how thrash metal should sound. Dave & Chris Poland were an amazing combination of guitarists...never again matched to the same degree thoughout the megadeth line-up changes... and Dave's voice on this album is like that of a rabid dog snarling and chewing his road to vengeance over the fools that fired him (No name dropping required). Buy this album or forever live knowing that the greatest album in history is not in your collection... <br />Best Track: Looking Down The Cross <br />Worst Track: N/A (tho these boots has annoying censored beeps) <br />Simmilar to: N/A, Nothing comes close... it's like the best of Judas Priest, Iron Maiden & Motorhead combined into one man! <br />Simmilar Suggestions: Peace Sells & So Far So Good by Megadeth, Show No Mercy by Slayer & Motorhead's Overkill & Bomber Albums.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I have loved this version since the first viewing! I must have rented it at least 15 times! I've seen others but for entertainment that keeps you engaged and not constantly pausing to go to the bathroom or for another drink, this is wonderful. I was never really a big fan, but after watching this version of Hamlet I've begun to delve into Shakespear's writings and I have Kenneth Branagh to thank for it. Please release this to DVD!
B000E8NQU4|5.0|This second historical musical outing took a break from the orchestral pop of \\"Days Of Future Passes\\" and dove into the land of psychodelia and rock & roll.  There are numerous special sound effects and fantastic song writing.  All is emphasized in the SACD format.  Here is a list of the extras on this set.<br /><br />Ride My See Saw (BBC Top Gear Session 16/7/68)<br />Tuesday Afternoon (BBC Afternoon Pop Show 7/10/68)<br />Simple Game (Single Version)<br />Departure (Alternate Mix)<br />Best Way To Travel (Additional Vocal Mix)<br />Legend Of A Mind (Alternate Mix)<br />Visions Of Paradise (Sitar Mix)<br />What Am I Doing Here? (Alternate Mix)<br />Word (Mellotron Mix)<br />Om (Full Version)<br />Simple Game (Justin Hayward Vocal Mix)<br />King & Queen<br />Dr Livingstone, I Presume (BBC Top Gear Session 16/7/68)<br />Voices In The Sky (BBC Top Gear Session 16/7/68)<br />Thinking Is The Best Way (BBC Top Gear Session 16/7/68)<br /><br />The alternate mixes of \\"Departure\\" and \\"Visions of Paradise\\" are worth the set alone.  This is a true feast for the ears.<br /><br />(Note: Disc 1 is an SACD mix made from the original quadraphonic tapes, however, for some odd reason, of all the seven original albums, this disc is SACD stereo - not multi-channel!  It is not the typical Moody Blues 4.1 mix (the center speaker was never developed from the quad mix). Disc 2 is the original remastered quadraphonic tapes, but mixed in stereo only - not SACD. This is seen as Disc 1 is gold colored and Disc 2 is silver.  Also note that because this was originally a quadrophonic mix, the center front speaker is not used).
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Those who are critical of this gem on the blues rock scene, saying he plays too fast, or something like that, must not have heard Stevie Ray or seen Mr. Vaughn play. He ripped it up live.  Bonamassa's critics probably wouldn't like Kenny Wayne Sheppard.  Joe Bonamassa has it all to be the next blues rock superstar.  Blues Deluxe showcases his voice and each of his guitar stylings, including slide and acoustic.  This is a superb blues album that was recorded so pristine you'd think the band is in your listening room. (What's a crying shame is that Joe's last 10 albums or so... since he's been with producer-extraordinaire, Kevin Shirley, sound like crap, muddying some incredible performances.)  Also, check out his first and best concert DVD from Germany at the Rockpalast, or whatever the place is called.
B000002BMV|5.0|Twenty-five years ago, \\"Escape\\" went to No. 1 with three top 10 hits. It represented a new beginning of rock 'n' roll after the implosion of disco. Emphasizing strength and freedom of youth, survival of love and new hope, it became a classic of that era that still holds up. Every song is a keeper with fantastic vocals and instrumental hooks.  Despite poor critical reviews, this album went on the sell over 10 million copies and is still a standard staple in rock & roll history!<br /><br />Note:  This is a Stereo SACD and not a Multi-Channel Surround, however, the sound is amazingly crisp.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I didn't see the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice in the theater, and rented it only when I couldn't find anything more interesting in the video store. I watched it once and was charmed despite my difficulty in understanding some of the dialogue. I watched it again and became captivated. This is a gorgeous version, and I am now a huge fan of Matthew MacFadyen's. He portrayed Mr. Darcy with subtlety and humor. Finally I 'get' the fascination with Austen's Mr. Darcy. <br /> <br />Warning: the performances in this movie are so stellar that you'll find yourself watching it over and over again, catching something new each time.
B0007M22TI|5.0|After seeing Celtic Woman on PBS, I could not miss the opportunity to see them live in San Bernardino yesterday. What an incredible, talented group of women these are! And the drummers are sensational! Even though I had already TIVO'd the PBS special, I am buying the DVD to get a super quality recording. Do not miss this group on CD, DVD and especially the chance to see them live! A beauty as close to perfection as you will find!
B00007GZR5|5.0|No other movie out there is as conforting for the soul as this one. All the transcending questions we have about where we come from, where we're going and why we're here, are amazingly portrayed in this movie. The plot gives us hope by showing that God does not punish, there's no judgement, hell is not eternal and everyone deserves a second chance (reincarnation).A tremendous achievement on screen!!!
B00006ADFL|4.0|I'll have to admit that my reason for wanting to see Heavenly Creatures was prurient. Anne Perry is one of my favorite mystery writers, and I was interested to see the movie Peter Jackson made about the murder she and her best friend committed as teen-aged girls. <br /> <br /> <br />Melanie Lynskey plays the part of Pauline Yvonne Parker, who grows up in a poor family. Her parents were never actually married, and they keep boarders in their home. Lynskey portrays Pauline as a very sullen teen-ager, and deserves much more credit for her portrayal than she has received. Very rarely do you see her exhibit true happiness in this film, and the few times she does, it is always when she is with her friend, whom she sees as the only way she has of excaping her horrible life. <br /> <br />Kate Winslet plays the part of Juliet Hulme, the privileged daughter of wealthy parents. To Pauline, it appears as though Juliet has the perfect life, but in fact, Julliet has a checkered past. Due to constant lung problems, her parents sent her away to live in the Bahamas for five years, leaving her in constant fear of abandonment. She meets Pauline on her first day of school after she and her family move to christchurch, New Zealand, and the two of them strike up a friendship.  <br /> <br />Although the movie depicts a lesbian relationship between the two of them, Anne Perry has staunchly denied that they were anything but friends. Indeed, it is not outside the realm of possibility that Perry is telling the truth as teen-aged girls frequently develop \\"crushes\\" on each other and have extremely intense personal friendships without any sexual involvement. <br /> <br />What is obvious, though is that both girls were highly imaginative, and they both fulfilled a deep need in each other. Pauline needed to feel as though she were a part of Juliet's wealthy family, and Juliet needed to have someone she could count on not to leave her. Indeed, in one scene of the movie, Juliet has experienced a recurrence of tuberculosis and her parents put her in a convalescent home before leaving to spend several months in England. Pauline and her mother are the only people to visit Juliet during that terrible time. <br /> <br />Juliet's world comes crashing down when she learns that her parents are getting a divorce. Her father is going back to England and she is being sent to stay with an aunt in South Africa. Once again, she will be abandoned by her parents and, even worse, she will be separated from Pauline. Pauline convinces her that if they kill Pauline's mother, the two of them will be able to stay together. <br /> <br />It is sad watching the scene of Pauline's mother preparing to go out for a day's outing with her daughter and Juliet. It must have been one of the happiest days in the woman's life-- her daughter was taking her to tea and then to a park, and then her daughter and her daughter's friend savagely murder her. It is the opening scene of the movie, and the closing scene of the movie. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson does a stellar job of weaving the girls' fantasy world into the real life elements of the story. Although he has taken some liberties with the story, that can be excused as neither of the women involved participated in any way in the making of the film. I can't say that I really enjoyed the movie so much as I thought it was an interesting portrayal of a horrible crime. However, the movie is a superb acting vehicle for a very young Kate Winslet and for Melanie Lynskey, both of whom do a terrific job of portraying their characters. The movie also foreshadows Jackson's genius and his attention to detail that we see later in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br />While I wouldn't want to watch the movie again, I am glad that I at least saw it. I've read about the crime and tried to picture the events in my head. Jackson did a terrific job of translating things that I've only read about into reality. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I somehow didn't feel the magic and electricity that I got from the 1995 mini series and Sense and Sensibility; which is a shame because I was all ready to adore this one too.  The reason I loved the mini series is because there was no stone unturned; every nuance of emotion was true to Austen's book. Even the narrations as Elizabeth read the letters. Too much goes on to gloss over the things that make you fall in love with the story.   There is no possible way to get the complete feel of the novel unless you have the time to do so.  Much like the Lonesome Dove mini series.  Although totally different genres, the characters felt real and were full-bodied.  The book had a light air to it much like the novel and the movie/novel Sense and Sensibility although both had their sad moments but I can't say this movie did that for me.  <br /> <br />  The only characters that I thought did complete justice to the novel and the mini series were that of Dame Dench's de Bourgh and Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins. I connected also from time to time with Knightly's rendition of  Elizabeth particularly when she overheard Darcy's opinion of her at the dance. Yet Blethens and Sutherland both of whose acting I adore just missed (more so Donald Sutherland) I don't blame the actors for this, mostly the director.  (I especially didn't care to Jena Malone's rendition of Lydia, which was slyer than it was totally oblivious, immature and childlike).  I just feel that this is such a beloved and full novel that leaving the small things that make it so wonderful isn't as satisfying   <br /> <br />I'm far from a novel purist but you just miss so much if all of it isn't shown.  If only Hollywood was brave enough to gamble on making something that length, this may have worked better for me.  But we know that will never happen.  I found it somewhat lacking and far from the BBC mini series caliber.   Maybe the extraordinary classics should all be mini-series.  For those who think this is good.... takesome time over a weekend to see the mini series with an open mind.  You'll be hooked!  <br />

0140544518|5.0|This post-modern story of the 3 Little Pigs takes a completely different approach than the other versions.  Author Jon Scieszka does a wonderful job telling the whole story from the Wolf's point of view.  The illustrations by Lane Smith enhance the text wonderfully through out the book.  There are many things in this story that the reader finds out about the \\"innocent\\" Wolf that nobody ever knew.  The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs is a funny childrens book that is sure to make anyone smile.
0393327655|5.0|Seldom have I come across a book that presents such a matter-of-fact scalding of the absurdities of religion.  We seem to be in a world where God has written a book.  Unfortunately there are several versions, each claiming they are infallible.  The different peoples of the earth, depending on the geography of their birth, are taught a certain version.  The franchise leaders agree on mainly one thing - that they will not tolerate each others' brand.    Despite this intolerance, there are many other ways they are alike.  They were all written at least a thousand years ago and reflect a bronze age mentality.  Some of their followers insist on taking every word of their book literally, which can be very bad.  They are all equally uncontaminated by evidence.  They all tend to think humanity is basically bad and that following their brand represents the only hope that people will act ethically.   They all advocate faith as the greatest virtue - that is, believing things that otherwise one might be medicated for believing.  Finally, all these believers of every brand get a free ride from criticism just because it's religion.    Tell a devout Christian that his wife is cheating on him, he will immediately hire a detective and put his whole life on hold.  Tell him his special 2,000 year old book was inspired by an invisible deity and that if he doesn't follow its tenets he will roast in Hell and he requires no evidence.   People were killed during the inquisition because they were accused of questioning the doctrine of transubstantiation - that the bread and wine of the Eucharist physically turns into the body and blood of Christ.  \\"Jesus Christ - who, as it turns out, was born of a virgin, cheated death, and rose bodily into the heavens - can now be eaten in the form of a cracker.  A few Latin words spoken over your favorite Burgundy, and you can drink his blood as well.\\"    When Harris finishes his - well, you would have to call it a tirade - he gets down to business with the serious situation regarding Islam today, why religion in general has a negative impact on society, and a few other topics.  Considering the sensitive subject matter, it's hard to believe that this book was a New York Times best seller, but it was - probably for the same reason that I had a hard time putting it down.  It is well-written and compelling.      As Harris says, \\"The only demons we must fear are those that lurk inside every human mind: ignorance, hatred, greed, and faith, which is surely the devil's masterpiece.\\"    I couldn't agree more.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|O.K., first of all, this probably isn't a film to show to really young tots who are just about to start elementary school, as they will probably get terrifiyed that they may get a teacher who is just like the Trunchbull (and of course kids that age will not understand that this is a partial fantasy and that no peron like that would be allowed to teach in this country in this day and age in real life). <br /> <br />Otherwise, this is a wonderful movie, one that certainly deserved to do better than it did in the theatre. Matilda is a little girl and a bonafide genius who is cursed with living with obnoxious, unloving parents who are too dense to notice her gifts, and a bratty older brother. Then the day comes when Matilda must start school. She goes to Crunchum Hall, where she makes friends and meets a nice teacher with a well-fitting name, Ms. Honey, and the evil, child-hating principal, the afore-mentioned Trunchbull. Ms. Honey soon recignizes Matilda's exceptional talents and wants her to be moved up several grades, but the Trunchbull will have none of it. (Ms. Honey tells the Trunchbull Matilda's memorized several multiplication tables, and the Trunchbull replies,\\"So can a parrot!\\") A new hope appears, however, when Matilda finds she also has the gift of telekinesis, and hatches a plan to get the Trunchbull to leave Crunchum Hall for good... <br /> <br />The best thing about this film is Maria Wilson's preformance as Matilda. The girl always manages to be cute and endearing without ever once becoming annoying. This is especially important as she's playing the title character and thus is always at the center of things, so that we actually enjoy watching the film because we enjoy watching her and it never once feels like a chore to sit through. (Sadly, her carrer seems to have been killed off thanks to being cast in pieces of crap like \\"Thomas And The Magic Railroad\\".)  <br /> <br />Also there's Danny Devito as Matilda's father. (Devito also narrates throughout thefilm, but not as his character, but in the third person.) Although as it's been mentioned before Devito doesn't much resemble the physical description of the father in the book, (who was described as a thin, wirey man,) Devito captures the spirit of the mean, crooked, thick-headed, unloving dad. You can't help but love Devito, even when he's playing this sort of character. The rest of the cast is great, also. Definetly one to own.
006056251X|4.0|To the London society, she is nothing more than a wallflower capable only of boring anyone to tears. But what no one, not even her fellow wallflowers, know is that Evangeline Jenner fears for what will become of her when she receives her inheritance. Until one night, fearful for her life should her mother's family have their way, she braves the night and goes to the home of Lord St. Vincent with the most outrageous proposition the notorious rake has ever received: marriage!<br /><br />Perversely proud of his amoral reputation, Sebastian has spent his life avoiding the likes of Evie. Yet, as he sat in his library waiting for her to explain the purpose of her visit, he begrudgingly realizes that the stammering wallflower isn't plain like he's always thought her to be. And the longer he stares at her, the more he notices that she is actually lovely. What's more, the bewitching chit actually possesses an innate toughness he has never encountered in a woman before. And with the ducal estate he will one day inherit in financial straits, Sebastian knows that he cannot afford to reject her offer - even if the condition is that they will never sleep together again after the wedding night.<br /><br />After my delight in the story of Marcus and Lillian in IT HAPPENED ONE AUTUMN, I couldn't wait to read this book to see what happens with Sebastian and Evie. I'm glad to say that I loved that these two end up with each other. Sebastian, for all his infamous reputation, proves to be a worthy husband. The little things he did for Evie that started on the way to Gretna Green, such as making sure she stayed warm, is so unexpected and sweet. As for Evie, I loved how she bloomed and slowly managed to shed her shyness. It was good to see her learn to stand up for herself, especially in those times when Sebastian tends to be high-handed. I loved these two together!<br /><br />DEVIL IN WINTER is another winner from Lisa Kleypas. If you're a fan of DREAMING OF YOU, which is my most favorite Kleypas novel, you will enjoy the reference to Derek Craven and his gaming club.<br /><br />Now I cannot wait for Daisy's story to see whom she ends up with.l enjoy the reference to Derek Craven and his gaming club.

0385504209|5.0|Critics say he copied the story, it has no depth, no culture. OK so this may hold some truth, but who REALLY cares? Dan Brown is making the story more accesible (look at the sales figures) and comprehensible (as the bible could be considered to have?) to the overall human population. The significance of such remarks depends a lot on whose reading it!! No matter who you are, it is worth reading and absorbing as it is highly likely that you will find something within that makes you stop and think, question and wonder. Aside from that, it is easy to read, travels at break neck speed, has a great many plots with unexpected surprises and the characters are easy to associate with. It could have you questioning aspects of your religious beliefs that until now you have accepted or left unconsidered. It is likely to leave you hungry for the truth or searching for something that your mind can be happy with for now, until you forget about it once more. At worst, it may make one stop and consider factors that are normally accepted as a part of an upbringing. HPC.
B000063DI9|5.0|After a few years of being into metal (which must mean that at some point I was into Maiden), this is still one of my favorite metal releases. I also consider it Bruce & company's best work. And here's why:<br /><br />: Dickinson's voice is excellent! This is the best I've ever heard him. His singing on this album is why he is regarded as one of the finest vocalists in metal.<br /><br />: The _excellent_ and tasteful use of synths. Maiden never lapses into that \\"80s\\" sound or cheesy territory with them. They are used perfectly and add a refreshing and original feeling of tension and atmosphere that their other albums lack (even _Somewhere In Time_, the previous album that started their dabbling into synthetic sounds)<br /><br />: The title track. It's the best Maiden song. Yes, I have a soft spot for \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", with the excellent guitar leads and harmonies that define Iron Maiden (it's also a perennial fan favorite). But not even that can compare with \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\". They take the epicness up a notch here, concluding with a dazzling finale of excellent guitar licks, and those awesome synths creating incredible tension that is resolved with the climax.<br /><br />Those are three reasons that I prefer _Seventh Son_ to any other Maiden album (in fact, it's really the only one I ever listen to these days). It still stands as a melodic, engaging, original (relatively), and totally epic metal milestone.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It's all about the story... right?  I mean...after playing FFVII the game and getting to the end,..how many of us LONGED for the story to continue?  I know I did...and even tho it took a while..this movie satisfies that longing and THEN some.  I've only seen the Japanese original with english subtitles, but even that was freakin awsome.  This movie is a must own for any FF fan and a definate \\"check it outer\\" for any anime/japanese CG film fanatic.  Pre-order, reserve, borrow your freinds...do whatever  you have to do to watch this film !
0345350499|4.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley's, The Mists of Avalon is a book that inspires, makes you really think, and is truly amazing. Ever since I have heard of King Arthur and his knights, I have been intrigued to learn more. This was the first novel on the Arthurian period that I was able to fully understand, because prior to this book I read Idylls of the King by Alfred Lord Tennyson, and good that book may be, it was hard to follow in some places. After beginning this book it didn't take long for me to become hooked, and even though I have not read any other of Marion Zimmer Bradley's works, I am curious about her other books on the days of King Arthur. The stories of Morgan Le Fay are of particular interest to me and she is a major player in Mists. This is so because this book is told from more of the women   \\"Behind the lines\\" point of view.      This book does not get into too much detail about the tales most of its readers already know such as the tales of the round table, ie the quest for the Holy Grail, Genevieve and Lancelot, how the sister of Arthur bore his malicious son, etc. These well-known and well-loved \\"facts\\" are in the book, and they are still relevant, but the underlying themes here are mainly the roles the many women in the days of Arthur played, and the battle of the newly formed Christianity vs. the old religion that was preserved on Avalon. There are also more side stories that are not as well known, such as the lives of the women on Avalon, and Morgaine's life after her forced marriage.       If you like/enjoy the movies about Arthur you will be absolutely blown away by this book. If you love this book i advise you not to watch the movies, they'll do nothing but upset you. If you plan to read this novel, but also have the movie, read the book first, because as with any book/movie combo the movie gives no justice to the book.     This book adds a realism to the times and the people that surround the tales of Arthur. Arthur is what we would call \\"whipped\\" byhis queen, his queen is an adulterer who compares herself to none, because she believes herself to be more holy than anyone she has encountered, Lancelot is arrogant and indecisive, Viviane is power- hungry and wants complete rule over Britain at the cost of anyone's life, Morgause is whorish and downright evil at times, and Morgaine is at times as overly fanatical as Genevieve but refuses to accept the suggestion that she might have to bargain with to get what she wants. This tale has been passed down for more than 700 years! But still the characters retain their humanness and we are able to relate, to a point with them until we realize the essence of the legends. Legends they may be, but when reading them we can't imagine them to be any less than real, and this book does well to remind us as readers that this is more than a legend.      This is my favorite book hands down, mainly because every word is dripping with detail, ready to be soaked up by our imagination, and has been my favorite book since I first opened the cover. I would recommend it to anyone of any age, whether you are new to the stories of Arthur, or if you have read every other bit of literature about that period, like I have. Even though I have come across many who don't like the stories of King Arthur and his knights, I am confident that they will fall in love with this book, and be able to open that doorway into the wonderfully exciting world of King Arthur.
0671027344|5.0|Because it was being touted as a \\"modern-day 'Catcher in the Rye,'\\" I didn't think there was any way that this -- the first novel by Stephen Chbosky -- could live up to its billing. I was surpised to find that it far surpassed my expectations. The short book is written as a series of letters to an unnamed \\"friend,\\" in which the protagonist, Charlie, shares the highs, lows, dreams, and disappontments of high school. <br /> <br />Charlie is a misfit -- he's been kept back a year because of a nervous breakdown -- but he finds a niche with a group of edgy older teens. During the course of this school year, he finds that love doesn't wear just one face, that friends sometimes have to take a stand, and that the past has a way of coming back. Highly recommended.
B00004RFFI|2.0|I watched Twister on cable and I admit I found the tornadoes fascinating, but what annoyed me about this film was the romantic sublot. Its a 'relationship in trouble' story, wherein the two leads (Bill & Jo) separated for an unknown reason and are forced back together under extremely contrived circumstances. Bill brings his fiancee to tornado alley while he tries to get his wife to sign the divorce papers. (I don't know about you, but Bill would be flying solo on that mission if I were the fiancee).  Jo procrastinates in an annoying way, forcing Bill to chase her. This was just stupid, unbelievable and extremely contrived and sets a tone of immaturity for the entire movie.<br /><br />Bill's character is indecisive and unlikeable. Not only can he not make up his mind about how he feels about his wife and his new girlfriend, he treats his current fiancee like dirt, abandoning her repeatedly when she needs him to play with a bunch of overgrown college geeks. If his fiancee had a touch of class she would have dumped his you-know-what the moment he started playing footsie with the ex. For god sakes, woman buy a clue! Paxton is a jerk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because this 'romance' was prominently featured in the film it was impossible to ignore and it distracted me from the tornado goodness that I really wanted to watch.<br /><br />2 stars
0895260131|5.0|Indeed there are at least 114 verses in the Qur'an that speak of love, peace, or forgiveness.....unfortunately most all of them are abrogated by what is contained in Surah 9.  The Qur'an is not in chronological order and Surah 9 is considered to be the last of the prophets revelations, and in Muslim teachings and traditions, therefore cancels previous verses.  Here are a few goodies from Surah 9.... <br /> <br />...Give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom to those who disbelieve--9:3  <br /> <br />...slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush.--9:5  (This Surah gives the command to kill those who do not convert to Islam) <br /> <br />9:14 Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers.  <br /> <br />9:29 Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low. (Fight against Christians and Jews \\"until they pay the tribute (the Dhimmi) readily\\") <br /> <br />9:33 He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the idolaters may be averse. (\\"That He may cause it to prevail over all religion\\"  The \\"Religion of Truth\\" (Islam) must prevail, by force if necessary, over all other religions.) <br /> <br />I could go on, but I will conclude with the continuation of the last verse you cited in your review...... <br /> <br />5:82 \\"Strongest among men in enmity To the Believers wilt thou Find the Jews and Christians; To the Believers wilt thou Find those who say, \\"We are Christians\\": Because amongst them are Men devoted to learning And men who have renounced The world, and they Are not arrogant.\\"  <br />Chapter 5 versus 85 - 88 (My source evidently varies from yours) <br />  <br />But you left out...... <br /> <br />5:83 When they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messengers, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their recognition of the Truth. They say: Our Lord, we believe. Inscribe us as among the witnesses. 5:84 How should we not believe in Allah and that which hath come unto us of the Truth. And (how should we not) hope that our Lord will bring us in along with righteous folk ? 5:85 Allah hath rewarded them for that their saying - Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the reward of the good. 5:86 But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are owners of hell- fire. <br />  <br />Basically, convert to Islam or die. <br /> <br />The good Muslims duty is to fight for Allah and progress toward a one world religion of Islam. <br />This book spells it out for you and displays the justifications Muslims use for their terrorist acts.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Steven Spielberg convinced me that he the best movie director around! This movie is simply superb. The storyline is intense and leaves a mark somewhere in your heart. The story is about the Mossad agent \\"Avner\\", hand picked by the Israeli Prime Minister \\"Golda Meir\\" to lead a team of another four Mossad agents and take revenge of Munich Massacre by eliminating the PLA group \\"Black September\\". The movie has very few moments of the Munich tragedy, but revolves more around the plot where \\"Avner\\" and his team members eliminate the Palestinian terrorists.<br /><br />Acting by Eric Bana is superb. Spielberg has done the perfect selection for his lead character, which looks fresh on the screen.  I am glad that the theme so intense and serious is handled by the genius and not by some new kid on the block.<br /><br />Many people will give negative remarks on the movie as most of the people have expected this like a action packed- fast paced thriller, but viewers with a liking for mature cinema will definitely like it. So, if you are looking for some Tom Cruise or Steven Seagal action, you are at a wrong place.<br /><br />A must for Spielberg fans.
B00065MDSG|5.0|I don't mean to imply that this is the best of all albums; I merely mean to say that there is nothing I would change about this album. Everything it sets out to do it does flawlessly. <br /> <br />The only unfortunate thing about the album is that it's very difficult to listen to while travelling. The volume ranges from eardrum-pounding to the barest whisper, so it's best listened to in a quiet room with top-of-the-line speakers or headphones. <br /> <br />This is a masterpiece of progressive rock, and indeed of music in general. I recommend it to anyone with an attention span.
0812976525|5.0|I picked this book up because I wanted to see the movie and I prefer to read a book before I see a movie based on it.  I thought the movie was good, but I thought the book was great.  The way style and humor were slick and masterful, and the character of Nick Naylor was somebody that you could both love and hate at the same time.  While the end almost seemed a little too convenient (I won't spoil it for others out there that haven't read it yet), it was still an amazing read that I recommend to anybody.  I've already moved on to some of his other books and am enjoying them as well.
1400079179|1.0|The funny thing about Dan Brown's books: they are all the same. I read one and really enjoyed it, and then read another and thought \\"Wow, it's like I'm re-reading the same book.\\" He is definitely a formula writer; he found something that worked for him and used it for everything else afterwards. It's almost as if he has a computer program that lets him substitute names, places, and circumstances, yet the events and timeline, even the relationship between the characters are exactly the same. This guy is a hack and an insult to every reader who has any sort of intelligence.
0743454537|5.0|Keep the tissue near by.....you WILL cry!  This story has it all.  Great characters, a dramatic story, and amazing humor.
B000059XUO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is the only movie that can excite me, put me on the edge of my seat, and make me cry all in the same hour and forty five minutes. It has everything from incredible fight scenes to a heartbreaking finale. The tragic death of Brandon Lee during the making of this film only adds to the heartbreaking reality of the love story behind it all. Brandon Lee gives a flawless performance in his final film that would have sky-rocketed him to stardom.<br /><br />Brandon Lee plays the rock star Eric Draven, who is killed, along with his girlfriend Shelly, on Halloween (The night before his wedding) by a bunch of thugs. One year later, Eric's restless soul is carried by a crow and he returns from the dead to seek revenge on the thugs that murdered him and raped his girlfriend and left her to die. One by one Eric makes his way down the line, with the help of a sympathetic cop, killing the thugs and finding his way to their leader who chooses who they kill. Eric also helps Shelly's friend Sarah (who is about twelve years old) develop a relationship with her drug addicted mother. Eric has two days to make things right before he returns to the grave, can he make it? I highly recommend that you watch and see for yourself. A dark, gothic action flick with awesome martial arts fights with a sad love story underneath. Without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever seen.
0066620996|5.0|I really love that Jim Collins explores essential aspects of growth and does it with a talented team - OVER TIME!!!<br /><br />The framework Collins and his team use to share the results of their research is masterful! The book is divided into three Discipled People, Disciplined Thought, Disciplined Action... and really, isn't this at the heart of success?  Beautiful, thoughful and fundamentally a wonderful contribution to those of us who love and are intrigued by organizational leadership, beahaviour and results.<br /><br />In the winter of 2004, Good to Great provided our leadership team at Tomoye Corp., with some excellent content to shape a collective inquiry.  Our team focused rather extensively on the Hedgehog Concept which centres around three central questions:<br /><br />1)What are you deeply passionate about?<br /><br />2)What you CAN be the best in the world at?<br /><br />3)What drives your economic engine?<br /><br />As you can imagine, these questions are essential to developing a clear and compelling organizational identity.  Our exploration of these questions was powerful - and would likely have been even more productive if the questions became integrated into our ongoing leadership team work and agenda.

0345350499|5.0|I usually don't read fantasy books. I got this as a present from one of my friends a couple years back. I have finally got the chance to read it. Wonderful book. I love the imagry of the book. It is starting to give Lord of the Rings a run for it's money.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, is an intriguing novel about Pi Patel, a young, Indian boy who endures much hardship during his experiences aboard a lifeboat, with his only companions, a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal tiger. His story is amazing and poignant, developed by Martel's vibrant description, as he pays great attention to the smallest details. It is ultimately a taxing journey of sacrifice and self-discovery. <br /> <br />Pi's journey starts aboard the ship, Tsimtsum, as he and his family begin their journey to Canada. The ship sinks, stranding Pi, and a several zoo animals, in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean. He learns, after the other animals have died, that he and the Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker, must rely on one another in order to survive this testing ordeal. Pi's resourcefulness allows him to endure his situation, no matter how difficult it may seem. At times, the routine that Pi is forced to adopt becomes somewhat monotonous, but is in keeping with his dire situation-being stranded at sea, with an already limited and now steadily decreasing supply of food and water.  <br /> <br />Martel spends all of part one of the novel, entitled Toronto and Pondicherry, developing Pi's character. He introduces the origins of his name, Piscine Molitor Patel, which is as diverse as his interest in religion. He is devoted to God, but wants to not only follow his family's Hindu faith, but the teachings of Christianity and Islam as well. It is part of Pi's unfaltering faith in all religions that allows him to survive 227 days at sea.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, Yann Martel creates a thought-provoking story of a young boy with extraordinary faith in many religions and a love of all animals. During his journey, he demonstrates his fervent belief in all things. Despite the initial fear he had toward the Bengal tiger, he comes to regard Richard Parker with much respect and amity. When he must say farewell to Richard Parker, he speaks from his heart, \\"I would like to say it formally: Richard Parker, thank you. Thank you for saving my life...I hope you will remember me as a friend. I will never forget you, that is certain. You will always be with me, in my heart\\" (Martel 286). Martel's skills as a storyteller and novelist are clear throughout Life of Pi, as he creates a mature, gentle character in Pi, one who is willing to accept religions of all kinds and has an optimistic attitude toward life. He endures much sacrifice during his journey at sea, but also demonstrates much self-discovery, as he never loses faith in his beliefs.  <br />
6305736650|5.0|[...] this movie gives so much pleasure it's impossible to resist putting my two cents in. Ever since I first saw it decades ago it's been by favorite movie (though I don't think it's the greatest ever made). Every character, from the sinister Bogart to the beautiful and confused Ingrid Bergman, from the cynical Claude Rains to the ambitious Sidney Greenstreet, is superb. And of course there's Dooley Wilson playing that midget piano, \\"Knocking on Wood\\" and crooning \\"As Time Goes By\\" which was written long before the movie was ever thought about. There are some odd things in the movie, too - the way Bogart can't pronounce \\"bourbon\\" so that it makes sense and the plane taking off in the fog (in the desert!). Whether Bogart would get Bergman at the end was kept a mystery throughout the shooting, but of course he would have to give her up - this was 1942, she was married to Henreid, and what kind of heel would he be if he got the girl? He's got Nazis to fight, anyway. The movie is a Hollywood classic and one that I'll continue to watch over and over again.
B000002B2T|5.0|This album features vocalist Layne Staley (of Alice in Chains), guitarist Mike McCready (of Pearl Jam), bassist John Baker Saunders, and drummer Barret Martin (of The Screaming Trees). I love Pearl Jam and I really love Alice in Chains (I've only heard one Screaming Trees song) so I had to check this out. This CD was made right after the final Alice in Chains album and was the final album Layne Staley ever recorded although he didn't die until 7 years later. This is really his farewell album though. In Alice in Chains, guitarist Jerry Cantrell wrote a majority of the lyrics. Staley wrote almost all the tracks on \\"Jar of Flies\\", a few songs on \\"Facelift\\", one of the best songs on \\"Dirt\\"  <br />(Angry Chair), and AIC's biggest hit \\"Man in the Box\\". On this album, Staley writes all the lyrics which gave him a chance to show how sad and alone he was. Staley was an extremely talented guy. He had a very unique voice that allowed him to sing hard rock tunes and then mellow songs like on here. His voice also expresses the pain he was going through, you can literally hear it in his voice. His lyrics are deep, dark, and painful. And he drew the cover of this album. Mike McCready has always been a talented guitarist and does some of his best work on this CD. Martin is a gifted drummer and along with Saunders creates a great rhythm section. But don't mistake this for an Alice in Chains album, because it's not. AIC was a hard rock band who mostly created hard rock jams. Every song on Mad Season is mellow, although a few are fast paced. This is a great change though and I love this CD. <br />Here are the tracks and some comments on each one: <br /> <br />1. Wake Up-5/5-Really mellow. Layne Staley sings it with a lot of pain in his voice. <br />2. X Ray Mind-5/5-It's not as mellow as the previous song, but it's great. It's really catchy. <br />3. River of Deceit-5/5-I read on an Amazon listmania thing, someone called this \\"possibly the saddest song ever recorded\\". I don't know about that, but it's definitley a sad song. Probably the saddest lyrics Layne Staley ever wrote. <br />4. I'm Above-5/5-This song is great. Really good drumming and guitar playing is awesome. The chorus is the best part of the song. <br />5. Artificial Red-4/5-This song is good, but it's the weakest on the album so far. <br />6. Lifeless Dead-5/5-Awesome! Totally awesome. Staley's cadence in the song is perfect, the lyrics are weird but good. <br />7. I Don't Know Anything-5/5-The most rocking song on the album. The drumming is really good, showing how talented he really is. <br />8. Long Gone Day-5/5-Has a simalar beat to the songs \\"Voodoo\\" & \\"Serenity\\" by Godsmack. This song was written and recorded long before those songs, but there is a simalarity. <br />9. November Hotel-5/5-This is one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard, it's freaking awesome! <br />10. All Alone-5/5-There's barely any lyrics, but this is probably the saddest song on the album. <br /> <br />Mad Season isn't better than Alice in Chains or Pearl Jam, but they were really good and had a lot of potential to become great. This first album is evidence of that, since every song is amazing. Any fan of Layne Staley should love it.  <br /> <br />GRADE: A+ <br />
B00064WSNW|5.0|If you're like me, you cut your KC prog rock teeth on albums like Lark's Tongues in Aspic, Red, Starless and Bible Black, the seminal Court of the Crimson King, Lizard, Islands, and In the Wake of Poseiden.  Then you come across this album and boy is it different. Get used to it. Robert Fripp took King Crimson and totally shook things up when they went into the studio to create Discipline.  For one, he added Adrian Belew, an avant garde musician, well known in the industry.  I believe it was this chemistry between Belew and Fripp that forever transformed the sound of King Crimson to this very day.  Anyways, each track on Discipline is a classic, so get used to hearing more from this album on KC's live compilations.  I think it's a matter of taste as to what manifestation of King Crimson really rocks your world, but Discipline would be a good place to start for anyone coming into the King Crimson universe.     My original review of this album reflected my surprise at the difference between Starless and Bible Black with Wetton at the vocals, and Discipline, and yes it did take a while to get my mind around the differences and begin to appreciate the new iteration of King Crimson with Belew.  All I would add is for anyone approaching this album to approach it with an open mind and you'll be opening the door to a pretty big musical universe full of creativity and imagination.
1400034779|2.0|I read this in my book club; otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it. The book never gets too involved in any one story. There are many cases Precious solves, too many. I was interested in the case of the missing boy and kept waiting for that to be developed. It wound up being anti-climactic. As I read it, I thought, this is it? I did enjoy Precious life story, and how she got to own her own agency. Some of the writing is very beautiful. Other members of my book club, said the other books are much better. Sadly, I'm not interested enough to find out. As for women detectives, I LOVED Maisie Dobbs by J. Winspear

Instead of living their lives together in happiness these two men married and had children because that is what is expected by society.

B0000019PA|5.0|At least it has a much higher probability of doing so than most other albums I've ever heard. I was introduced to this album when a friend told me I sing like Jeff Mangum (I now realize this is a dubious distinction) and I should check out \\"On Avery Island\\" by NMH. Though I love \\"Avery\\", \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" deserves all the praise (and more) that's been lavished on it. Mangum's lyricism, infused with dire urgency and warped imagery, hit nerves that every songwriter dreams of. This album is a mind bomb; it blows a hole in my consciousness every time I hear it. At this point I must have heard it ten thousand times. Do yourself a favor and disregard any insights you've read into the meaning of this album: Anne Frank, Christianity, Carrots, et cetera. Whatever Mangum meant is irrelevant; he and the band channelled something mystical and true... and put it on tape. The         feelings evoked by this record are as vivid as fever-dreams. Buy this album and play it for everyone you love.
B000002UA5|5.0|Before hitting their stride with albums like \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\" or \\"The Wall\\" Pink Floyd put out a few really weird albums. The two that stand out in my mind are this album and \\"Atom Heart Mother\\". Both have more tracks with combinations of musical sound effects than actual songs that you'd be able to jam to in a car. Out of those two albums, this is the better one. Disc 1 features four songs that are standout. <br />Disc 2 features projects by all four guys, doing their own thing. This album also has my favorite Pink Floyd album cover next to \\"Wish You Were Here\\". The picture-within-a-picture-witin-a-picture-within-a-picture thing is really cool. I don't really know if Umma Gumma is essential for the Pink Floyd collection, but it's a really good album and a forgotten masterpiece. <br /> <br />TRACK LIST: <br />Disc 1 <br />1. Astronomy Domine-5/5-Weird song, but has a really soothing beat to it and Roger Waters and David Gilmour singing simultaneously. <br />2. Careful With That Axe, Eugene-5/5-A trippy instrumental with some screaming. It's weird, but it's just like Track 1. Soothing beats. <br />3. Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun-4/5-The weirdest song on the disc. It's got this really weird drumming and then barely coherent singing, but it's not bad. <br />4. A Saucerful of Secrets-3/5-The weakest song on the album, I didn't like this at all. <br /> <br />Disc 2 <br />1.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon's \\"Serenity\\" is a wonderfully entertaining science fiction adventure that will fly by as you're watching it.  Like all great SF movies, the action and special effects serve the story and the characters, not the other way around.  Having said that, however, when the action and effects kick in, they really kick in.  There are terrific chases, space battles, and confrontations, as well as all kinds of other surprises.<br /><br />Those surprises, by the way, include some very clever revelations about the mysteries introduced in the short-lived but much missed \\"Firefly\\" television series, where the movie's characters were introduced.  For that reason, you might want to pick up the inexpensively-priced \\"Firefly\\" boxed set (you get all the show's episodes in the one set) and watch them before diving into \\"Serenity\\".  By all means, you don't need to do that- there's a painless and even clever re-cap of the show's major happenings in the movie's opening minutes- but why miss out on the fun of the show before enjoying the movie?<br /><br />Also, getting to know the characters by watching the show first will give added impact to some of the movie's major dramatic moments.  But be warned, that added impact won't always be of the happy variety, as Mr. Whedon believes that in order to generate genuine tension in a danger-filled adventure like this one, the viewer has to see that not everyone will make it out alive.  That's all I'll say on that score.  Well, I'll also say this: As well as directing the movie, \\"Serenity\\" was also written by Joss Whedon, so you know you'll be getting some funny stuff here, too.<br /><br />The DVD offers a sharp, clean widescreen image, and there are many interesting, fun extras, including a chatty, informative commentary track by Mr. Whedon.  This is one of my favorite DVDs, and I bet you'll like it, too.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This marvelous film's detractors, almost universially, either take issue with the plausibility of its pharmaceutical company bad-business plot thread, or accept that aspect in theory, but found a feature-length geo-economic lecture dry and boring. <br /> <br />I'm fascinated by these objections, because the film I watched wasn't quite about pharmceutical scandals. The film I watched assumed its viewers understood and accepted that high-flying, well-monied, western-world industrialists would always be tempted to exploit vulnerable third-world folks on the ground, and uses this stipulation as the backdrop for an incredibly potent love story. <br /> <br />Accpeting the reality of this sort of exploitation, and reflecting upon the terrible pain of those caught in the crossfire are different things, \\"The Constant Gardner\\" reminds viewers. Rachel Weiss' doomed heroine understands this. She's a great character--an astute, passionate young woman fully engaged in the lives of the African villagers she deals with daily at a health clinic. Her husband, by contrast, is a perfectly good man, but also perfectly pragmatic, systematic, respectful of authority, cautious and quiet to a fault. <br /> <br />What drives the film along is the incredibly observed and authentic way the quiet husband slowly adopts his late wife's sensibilities--it requires a terrible jolt, but when the man who never so much as shouts or doubles with laughter finally sinks to his knees and cries, it's devastating filmaking. <br /> <br />This isn't a story about the suffering woven by evil coroporations. It's a story about dynamic individuals navigating those ugly threads, falling in love, and slowly, painfully, if a bit too late, learning understand each other. <br /> <br />If, at movie's end, the viewer also elects to trace those threads back and resent the possibility that western economic interests exploit third-world citizens, all the better.
0380973634|5.0|This is a very imaginative book.  I was drawn into Neil Gaiman's underground world very quickly.  His view of the way we as a society view the homeless will make you really think.  I loved the way the author wove a love story, an adventure and a bit of science fiction.  If you want all of the above you will definitely find it in this book.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|If you played FFVII you know the ending is lacking. I guess that because of space and compression issues on those old CDs.  This movie opens exactly where the ending FMV in FFVII left off and is the complete ending to the game. Probably the best ending FMV ever.. The best way to watch this movie is to finish FFVII, watch te little snippet FMV at the end then pop this in. It will not disappoint.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|For many people, Advent Children will be difficult to swallow because of it's origins. It is after all a follow-up to the successful RPG game that was spun in 1997. The film gives a brief history of what those who did not play the game missed out on, but there are some drawbacks to this. For instance, Aeris's (the spirit who continually appears to Cloud throughout the film) name is never spoken throughout the film, as are many other characters. It's not a huge travesty, but as such a large part of the film's themes it's sad that she and other characters go throughout the film nameless. <br /> <br />In fact, there are many flaws with this film. The trio of clones who are after are protagonist from the beggining of the film, for example, appear out of nowhere, and have no stories embedded in the game. This gives viewers more options for discussions and theories which is the success of the mystery of these three clones. I couldn't discuss the other flaws without giving away spoilers, and I don't want to do that. Just know that with all the flaws there is something within these flaws that succeeds, like in the example I gave. <br /> <br />As a fan of the game, you will appreciate the rendered, stylish look of the characters and getting more up close and personal with them, particularly the Shinra employees whose personalities weren't so apparant in the game. In the film their personalities are abundantly more clear. You will also probably grow to love some characters more than you already do, as each character shines and has some uniquely stylish attribute, whether that be in speech or battle, that is entirely their own. Characterization is a strong point of the film. <br /> <br />It's visually explosive and has extraordinary style that rivals The Matrix. The animation is intensely fluid and sometimes I got lost in the animation, forgetting that this was in fact an animated movie I was viewing. The battles in particular are superbly done, and could only be done in CG ifthat tells you anything about how superiorly stylish they are. In fact, this really is an action movie first and foremsot. Certainly there are deeply felt themes of life and death and choices and family and friendship, but two thirds of the film are generally made up of action sequences. If you have never played the game, it's worth viewing purely for the action sequences. <br /> <br />The score is fitting, but what can one expect from Nobuo Uematsu, the music genius that he is. <br /> <br />Overall most Final Fantasy VII fans will like this film, and most people who haven't played the game will enjoy it if anything for the fluid animation style and gripping action scenes that make you wanna shout during the film. It's a true achievement, particularly for the cinema, and being #1 on Amazon.com should be a testament of how far it has reached.
0553579908|3.0|Mr. Martin starts to digress as he spends more and more time with more and more characters. The shifts in Points-of-View become tiresome. The story fractures as its focus shifts away from the Starks, the protagonists of his first novel. A good read, but really several stories rather than one coherent story.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater's second album, Images & Words, is one of the most ground-breaking and innovative albums of the 90's. It is a milestone in progressive metal and has been the inspiration for countless musicians who heard this disc and decided to play music. Whether this is the best Dream Theater album is debatable. There are people who will consider this and its follow-up their finest works, while some others will claim Dream Theater grew from record to record, always pushing the form of the envelope. However, what cannot be argued is that Images & Words is certainly the most important album they've released and one of the cornerstones of the genre. They have and probably never will sell this well again either. This is their only album that went gold Stateside, mainly because of their radio hit \\"Pull Me Under\\".<br /><br />The song starts with echoic acoustic guitars, creating a nice aura, before rolling drums enter the mix and make way for hypnotic guitar riffs by John Petrucci and beautiful synths by Kevin Moore. Inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet, \\"Pull Me Under\\" is highlighted by an infectious chorus, delivered masterfully by James Labrie, and a thick bass bottom. Petrucci's sweeping guitar arpeggios and Moore's textural synth work lay the foundation of the piece which lyrically deals with mixed feelings about revenge and death, and even the contemplation of suicide. For years, the abrupt ending of the song has caused controversy among prog fans. Some said it was a mastering mistake; while others disagreed, claiming the unexpected cut-off is meant to signify the sudden, unexpected death of a person, which makes sense. This can be best noticed at the very end of the track where Labrie sings an excerpt from Hamlet: \\"Oh that this too, too solid [sullied] flesh would melt\\".<br /><br />Made up of eight tracks, Images & Words is one of the most balanced albums Dream Theater have produced. Alternating between melodically strong, riff-heavy tracks to more moody, ballady pieces, the variety captured on this disc is stunning. \\"Another Day\\" is not only a more compact number, but it also offers one of the finest guitar solos by Petrucci you'll ever hear, not to mention the soaring soprano saxophone that runs through it. This is followed by \\"Take the Time\\", a song interlocking atmospheric synths and a groovy bass and guitar tandem. As its title and lyrics suggest, this song reflects the state of the guys' minds (this is the only track on the album with lyric contribution by each member). Without a label, singer, and a fully defined musical direction, Dream Theater decided to take their time to find their own niche, enriching the piece with a powerful vision of songwriting: great backing harmonies, acoustic and synth breaks, storming drum attacks, and a soaring vocal performance are all merged into the compositional framework which has resulted in a Dream Theater classic, still played live in concerts.<br /><br />Though each piece is vital to this album's success, the general opinion is that \\"Metropolis Part 1\\" and \\"Under A Glass Moon\\" are Images & Words' centrepieces. The former is their heaviest and arguably most technical work, littered with a jaw-dropping drum solo by Portnoy (after hearing it for the first time my head was spinning so badly I couldn't believe it for a second), great unison leads, killer bass breaks, and incredible melodies. Portnoy's snare sound may not be to everyone's liking as every Dream Theater album after this one exceeded its predecessor in terms of production and mixing. But other than that, some of the guitar work on this track also helped spawn their later masterpiece Scenes From A Memory. \\"Under A Glass Moon\\" is another Dream Theater classic. I love its symphonic opening, laced with plenty of Yes-like analog synths by Moore, lending the piece a distinct 70's feel.<br /><br />With all that said, the last two songs on the album are perhaps my favourites: \\"Wait for Sleep\\", given its neat piano playing, reflective lyrics, and excellent vocal harmonies, displays ideas that would be further developed and perfected on their following album Awake. This song was written entirely by Kevin Moore and serves as an intro to the amazing \\"Learning to Live\\", perhaps their darkest and most haunting (and longest too) song on the album. The lyrics of this song were inspired by the AIDS epidemic and it contains some direct references to a book by Ayn Rand. That said, the piece can be interpreted in any way by the listener, as Myung's choice of imagery and word plays are amazing (it's a shame he no longer writes lyrics in the band). I recently saw Dream Theater live on their Octavarium tour where they played this track, almost twice as long, yet rendering it equally emotional and effective.<br /><br />It would be hard to imagine a progressive metal fan who doesn't own Images & Words. Everyone surely has their own favourite Dream Theater album, but I shall repeat what I said in the beginning of this review: Images & Words is a masterpiece and the most important Dream Theater album, ever.vocal harmonies, displays ideas that would be further developed and perfected on their following album Awake.

B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is the weirdest film I've ever seen. It beats even the strangest surreal films, such as Un Chien Andalou. I tried to watch Eraserhead 20 years ago, but couldn't get past its stark images, eerie sound, and oblique, if totally nonexistent, storyline. Now, I think it's one of the best surreal films ever made. Seeing Lynch's other works since then has enabled me to see Eraserhead as his warped masterpiece.    The lighting and cinematography are great, and the lack of dialogue adds to the creepiness. It's a wonderfully nightmarish dreamscape of the macabre world of Henry Spencer.    Because there is no correct explanation of the film's meaning, it's a beautifully obscure work that can be interpreted differently with every viewing. Lynch has said that all the explanations he's seen of the film don't come close to the meaning he intended--and I hope he never explains it. That would just ruin the film's mystery.
B00005LQ04|5.0|People who dont like this movie dont understand it for what it is. Its a beautifully done masterpiece. This movie was not scary to me and IMO is not suppose to be. But it is a horror movie and delivers everything a horror movie should. The atmosphere, gore, and music in this film are almost perfect. But you dont get the kind of gore you would get in his gaillo films like Deep Red or Tenebre. This is one of the most visually amazing movies ever made, and most amazing movie ive ever layed my eyes on. Recommended for anyone with eyes and ears.
055357342X|3.0|I've enjoyed all of Mr. Martin's books, but they all suffer from one overarching fault.  They really should be several books rather than one.  His attention seems to jump from one character to another with no rhyme or reason.  There are too many stories to fit in one book.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I went into this movie with very low expectations. As a lot of other reviewers pointed out, the show has a lot of nudity and sadistic gore. But it was entertaining, I have to admit. Not once was I bored. I mean, how can cutting off fingers be boring? All right, I admit I like a little gore. But this movie actually had a pretty interesting plot. Three guys tour Europe looking for sex and think they've found paradise in Bratislava. Pretty far from the truth. I won't spoil it for yuh but they get quite a shock when they've realized they've been lured there by a sadistic crazy man who has \\"always wanted to be a surgeon\\". I thought Jay Hernandez did a great job in the lead role. I was totally rooting for him after he discovers the truth and tries to save his life (as well as that Japanese girl). All around a pretty good flick, if you like the \\"Saw\\" type gory horror movie. Perhaps Tarantino's goriest film. Not to be missed! I'll never stay in a hostel in Europe again. Haha. Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well written witty and fun series that my son received as a birthday gift - the whole family has enjoyed it immensely. <br />It is a must see if you liked the movie Serenity. <br />I hope there's a sequel! <br />Why does the public not know more of this great entertainment?
B0002IQNAG|5.0|A zombie masterpiece nonstop action,zombie flesh eating,Savini's gore and Romero directing you cant go wrong. George A. Romero is a brilliant director And his trilogy is proof (Land of the dead was not so good IMO).This ultimate editon is great but I didnt really like the european version, Argento is still the man though. The soundtrack is amazing (was even ripped off by hell of the living dead another great zombie movie) The blue zombies were an amazing effect and gives it a classic feel, everything about the movie gives it a classic feel.The first time I watched this and especially Day of The dead I wasent that impressed but WITHOUT A DOUBT they grow on you the second time around(maybe its just me).This is one of the greatest zombie movies ever made,if not the greatest one.
0553801503|4.0|Mr Martin gives us the next chapter in his saga for half of his huge cast. He should have given a book for each character.  This book reads a bit more coherently than the last two since at least we aren't distracted by half of his ensemble cast. We are still left dizzy from one Point-of-view shift to another, just not as bad. Again I wish he had just continued telling the story of the Starks rather than wandering all over his creation. He should have left the other characters to other novels. Again, too many stories crammed into one book. But still a rich and entertaining read.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I love the Beatles.THE BEATLES made great music period.This is a terrific value for money compilation from the fab four.All the songs are good.I only would have been happier if they had included ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC which is a superb song.I love the glorious sixties during which we got to hear music from great bands like THE YARDBIRDS,THE KINKS,CREAM and the emergence of three of the greatest rock bands in LED ZEPPELIN,DEEP PURPLE and BLACK SABBATH.Please ignore the one star reviews for this album and get it.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|Easily the worst film I suffered through last year.  I loved Traffic.  I own Traffic.  I've watched it multiple times, and enjoy the layered complexity of the film and it's characters.  Syriana, however, was the single most confusing film I've ever seen.  When it ended, we were all trying to figure out what had happened, or what the movie was even trying to say.  That oil companies run the world?  Whoa!  Big surprise there!  Is there anyone who doesn't already believe this?  If you don't, this movie isn't going to convince you, and if you do, then you're wasting what seemed like about 8 hours of your life by watching this flick, so do yourself a favor and skip it.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This movie was so amazing and I was extremely attracted to the theme.  The story involves alot of seduction and betrayal.  I call that the perfect mix for a teen movie.  I am a teenager myself, and I found it to be quite interesting.  The cast was great, and I think that made the movie even better.  It was a movie involvong every type of character, the good girl, the evil whore, and to top it off, one guy for both girls.  I would reccomend seeing it, but watch out because the content is a little intense sometimes.  I hope you see it and enjoy!
0671578855|5.0|As usual, the critical voices are few and far between. And their criticisms lack substance. One negative reviewer obviously did not even read this book, basing her review entirely on the cover and her own antipathy towards short men and popular culture.<br /><br />In this volume, Bujold treads new ground with Miles. This book is about relationships, not space battles. Again, widget-lovers should go elsewhere. Based on the negative review that I read I hazard that pretentious blowhards should stay away as well.
B00005JOYA|2.0|I went to see this movie because it was the only \\"scary movie\\" showing at the time.  I'm really into video games, however, I've never played any of the Silent Hill fourpiece.  I found that this movie left me unentertained, confused, and overall angry at the usher.  Granted that Silent Hill is chock full of suspense, I was never even close to the edge of my seat.  I would've rather paid $8.50 to see Iron Eagle IV instead of this attempt at a film.  Whomever produced/directed this movie should stick to video games or be shot in the kneecaps.  It has some okay special effects, and the plot alone had potential to be a video game-movie that for once didn't suck.  But it didn't.  If you are thinking about seeing Silent Hill with your boyfriend or girlfriend, just send me a money order for the cost of the tickets, and I'll travel to your home and slap both of you in the face.  At least this way will be less humiliating.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain has got to be one of the best movies this year.  Why it didn't win the 'Best Picture' Oscar I'll never know.  Being an Aussie, I am soooo proud of how far our little Heath has come!!  Not only him, but the whole cast did a really respectable job.  I've always loved Michelle Williams (I was a big Dawson's fan), and even though she really wasn't in the film that much, she did an amazing job when she was.  The casting of Heath and Jake was just perfect.  I really recommend you all see it.
B00000K3UU|5.0|<br />Yes, I am an Adam Sandler fan, but I'm not obsessed about him as some of his other fans are. I appreciate his humor, don't ask me why but I find him funny. Most critics batter him for childish antics, bathroom humor, violent slapstick, and immaturity. True, he can childish and immature in his humor, but he is just lovable enough to get away with it. Anyway, the people I know like to laugh at the one-liners and antics of BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WATERBOY. but not a lot people talk about BIG DADDY as much, and that's too bad.  <br /> <br />Meet Sonny (Sandler), a 32-year-old law school grad on the fast track to nowhere: Rather than take a high-paying job in a high-powered New York City firm, Sonny works one night a week in a tollbooth and hangs out with the deli delivery guy (Rob Schneider). Now meet Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a cute five-year-old who appears on Sonny's doorstep with a note from his mom claiming he's the illegitimate son of Sonny's best law-school buddy Kevin (Jon Stewart), who's just left for China. No problem, thinks Sonny: A son will get his life on track and help him win back his wayward girlfriend (Kristy Swanson). But when a compromising situation arises and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him, Sonny gets desperate and has social services look for a family that can take Julian. Instead of letting Julian end up in an orphanage he volenteers to look after him, giving the kid options instead of orders, letting him dress however he likes, bathe when he wants and eat what he likes, but soon he realizes that he needs to set boundries for the kid in order for him to excell school. Sonny starts to bond with the kid. But after ignoring calls from social services, Sonny is taken to court for Fraudulently hold Julian under his biological father's name. <br /> <br />I think this is one of Sandler's best, not only because he's downplaying his humor impulse to stutter like Bobby Boucher, get violent like Happy Gilmore, or act childish likeBilly Madison. But because he seems to have matured a bit as an actor and as a person. His humor is dry, but funny. Rob Schnider is hilarious as Nazo the delivery guy, and Steve Buscemi is uproarious as the homeless guy. Adam has really come a far way since BILLY MADISON, he's a hell of a lot more calmer, and a little bit more likable to the non-Sandler-fan community. Yes there is some bodily humor here, but it's marginal and it doesn't come from Adam, which is good because it wouldn't wear well on a man in his mid-30s as it would on a little kid. All in all, if you're not a Sandler-fan, you're better off not watching his earlier stuff first, because he can get carried away with the childish humor, so start off slow and watch BIG DADDY, THE WEDDING SINGER, or 50 FIRST DATES. <br />
B00003CXTG|1.0|This abominable excuse for historical fiction suffers from an overabundance of fiction and too little history. It is appalling to think that with the thousands of real people involved in the actual event, they had to dredge up two fictional cardboard cutouts to serve as the heroes.  The attempt to insert some history with Cuba Gooding Jr. fails abominably as he is underutilized and his insertion into this lengthy melodrama is clearly forced and tokenism at its worst.
0060512806|3.0|The book is quite good regarding discussion of cryptography, but the story lacks a bit in maintaining reader interest.
B0000214F0|3.0|Absolutely great hardcore porn scenes with gratuitious history thrown in for... why? Not sure. Seemed like it should have been one or the other, but this movie tries to be both.
0553213105|5.0|I admit I have heard of this book but never thought it would be interesting since the language was not easy. In general all classic novels are not easy. However, ever since I saw the movie, I couldn't help wonder what screenwriter has omitted from the original book. I decide to buy the book. To my surprise, I kept reading on. Usually when I read a book, I read a couple of pages then something came up. I never went back to finish the book. This book is different. The desire to know more about Elizabeth Bennet who was played by Kiera Knightly and Mr Darcy kept me going. During my lunch time at work, I read. At home, I would read until 3 or 4 am. Once I reached the end of the book, I wished Jane Austen had written the sequel. It's the most enduring romantic novels. Wished I was Elizabeth being admired by a rich noble guy like Mr Darcy.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|For anyone who has played Final Fantasy 7, this movie will give you goosebumps, so much of it brings the nostalgia of playing it, so long ago... Theres even parts where you'll be suprised at the aspects from the game that have been added, once you have it, pay close attention, even the most minor of scenes has clues to what has happened to the heroes and heroines in the time between.. <br /> <br />The graphics are simply amazing! More than once I found myself with my mouth open, just starring. The fight scenes, which by the way there are more than you can shake a stick at, are well thought out and coordinated. And the world of Final Fantasy 7 is complete in it's perfection. <br />The score is breathtaking and flows smoothly with the movie. The ochestra brings new life to the polyphonic tunes that we're used to hearing while watching Cloud. <br />Most of all, the replay value of this movie is very high. I saw the Japanese version 12 times and I plan to do the same with the english.. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a must have movie for any previous, present, or future Final Fantasy player/fan.
B00005JOYA|4.0|At many other other review sites, I saw a trend that disturbed me.<br /><br />This movie is not like the current crop of torture flicks out there.  There are no backpackers in the middle of Australia who spend two hours being slowly killed in excrutiatingly graphic ways.  No boorish American men who get their just desserts when they seek something new and horrid to play with in Eastern  Europe.<br /><br />No, Silent Hill is a nightmare you can't wake up from, where the most recognizable place, the safest sanctuary such as a grade school turn into a hell not even Dante can imagine.<br /><br />The cries of witch and burn her are real, when one considers the number of gay bashings that occur nightly and the hate focused on Muslims in the US.  The Burning Times my be over for the witch but do exist for anyone different<br /><br />Having said that, the leads turn in horrifingly real performances.<br /><br />Rose has to save her daughter Sharon, by any means necessary.  Sharon has nightmares that lead her into dangerous bouts of sleep walking, some of which become life threatening.<br /><br />In these sleepwalks, she mentions Silent Hill.  THanks to the beauty of the Internet, Rose finds Silent hill and off they go, leaving Chris, Rose's husband terrified of what the hell happened.<br /><br />Just as they enter Silent Hill (after of course being warned off by the well meaning neighbors) Rose has a car accident, which knocks her out.  When she wakes, Sharon is gone and Rose must find her.<br /><br />Like the game, reality is constantly shifting, with only a siren as a warning as we slide into the Hell dimension.<br /><br />THis movie is not for those who want a slash em, torture them and don't make me think movie.  THis is also not for the weak of stomach.  Some of the images are graphic and disgusting but each serves a purpose.<br /><br />This is perhaps the second best video game adaption.  I hold Mortal Kombat the original as the best, then this then Resident Evil.<br /><br />This is a true horror movie, playing on our fears and our nightmares not our gag reaction.  There are no monsters that jump at your witha klaxon of music, the monsters are there but they appear as silently as the name.<br /><br />This is a European Horror Film with a taste of Asia.  Well worth it for those tired of zombies and torturersars and our nightmares not our gag reaction.  There are no monsters that jump at your witha klaxon of music, the monsters are there but they appear as silently as the name. <br />This is a European Horror Film with a taste of Asia.  Well worth it for those tired of zombies and torturers
B000FA57RQ|5.0|It's awesome to watch Truth or Dare and then I'm Going To Tell You A Secret to see just how much Madonna has changed and yet how much she's stayed the same.  Madonna has matured, married, had chilren and sees the world through the eyes of what I think is a much wiser and introspective woman.  Yet she remains ambitious, bitchy, funny, witty and still the best live performer of our generation.  Ignore all the naysayers this is a wonderful movie and it's about time it's out on DVD!
0446608955|5.0|It was Landon Carter's senior year at Beaufort High School and things were going pretty well. At least that's what he thought. Although he was the son of a Congressman, he wasn't popular, or athletic, and worst of all, he didn't have a date to the Homecoming dance. Almost every girl in town was taken, every girl except for Jamie. Jamie was the daughter of the town's minister and she was also the nicest, shiest, and most faith filled person Landon had ever met. So why didn't Landon want to ask her? Probably because she was the last person that Landon or anyone else wanted to go to Homecoming with. But, Jamie was one of those people that you just couldn't let down. After going to the dance together, Landon and she became good friends. Landon even decided to star in the Christmas play with her and their friendship traveled a lot farther than he expected it to. Just when Landon thought that nothing could separate them, Jamie told him a secret that almost changed everything. <br /> I really enjoyed this book and it was a fairly quick read. Nicholas Sparks' books are usually always exciting and this one is as well. I could never put this book down and I always had to find out what was going to happen next. My favorite thing about this story is that Jamie is always trying to bring out the best in people. She is such a great person and she is trying her hardest to make Beaufort a better place. I didn't exactly like the part when Jamie revealed her secret. I felt that it was ruining the story, until I read on and finished the book to find out that it made the story that much better. I really enjoyed it. <br /> Although this is probably more of an advanced read, I think any girl would enjoy it. But with this being a love story, I don't think many guys would be interested. If you like twists and turns and reading the unexpected, I recommend this book to you. I hope you read it and enjoy! <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Do we have shades of David Lynch in Brad Anderson ? With three <br />films to his credit (please see Session 9 and Happy Accident), <br />we have among us a very talented Writer and Director. YOU MUST <br />SEE The Machinist. It is a WORK OF ART that is both disturbing <br />and moving. You will not forget this film, and Christian <br />Bale has a great deal to do with the beautifully disturbing <br />idiosyncracies of this film which deals with guilt, retribution and redemption with psychological obssession and decay as <br />a subtext and I won't say more about the plot. <br /> <br />Forget Brokeback Nonsense and Hollywood pre-marketed drivel. <br />If you are interested in artistry in film, then Brad Anderson <br />is your man. Enjoy.....
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Horny college kids travel abroad to find hot chicks and in the first half of the movie they do find hot chicks...and in the 2nd half they find torture and death.Director Eli Roth ripping off The Most Dangerous Game premise where the rich pay to kill and upping the horror cliche ante of sex leading to death...now it leads to graphic mutilation then death.Hostel is undeniably trashy,not very scary but it's also a lot of fun in a sleazy way.Like The Man Show this film seems specifically geared toward men and is an effective nasty little B-movie.Unlike Saw there are no clever games so it takes very little brainpower to enjoy this film.A likable cast,a wicked sense of humor,nice use of forgein locations,some good gore and an unapologetic immoral approach are what elevate Hostel over safer big budget Hollywood flicks.Not great art but it is great fun.
0698119347|5.0|Alex had been told that his uncle, who was like a father to him had been killed in a car wreck.  Alex has a gut feeling that that is not what actually happened to his uncle, so he sneaks into the car impound lot to find the windshield of his car was full of bullet holes.  Then Alex is told that he must become a spy, and he gets sent to Sayle Enterprises, where he is nearly killed several times. <br /> This place is giving away computers to all of the schoolchildren. If Alex doesn't quickly uncover a deadly secret, it will cost him the life of all the school children in England. <br />I would give this book five stars, because it really draws you into it and makes you want to keep reading.  Once you're done you will want to read the next book in the series.  This book is full of action.  My dislike about this book is that a lot of the action seemed pretty fakey and if they ever tried to make a movie of  it probably wouldn't be very good. <br /> If you like James Bond or anything like that you will love this book. This book takes the Cody banks idea to the next level.  If you are into anything like that you will love this book.  <br />
B0000X61UU|5.0|If you loathe exercise videos in which the instructor is telling you \\"good job - keep it up - way to go - that looks good\\" when you know they can't see you, this is an excellent alternative.  Cindy is clear in her instructions, of course her body is inspirational, and she doesn't insult your intelligence.  The video itself is shot in some beautiful locations and the music isn't overbearing. The actual exercise sequences are challenging and continue to be so - even if you use this tape several times a week for a few months like I did.  The best thing about this video is the results - I used this video several years ago and got down to a healthy size 4/6.  I just ordered the DVD version to get me back into shape after having my first baby and can't wait to start this routine again!
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Lord of War follows Nicolas Cage through dangerous territory who becomes wealthy dealing arms but is emotionally unaffected by the conflicts around him.With little emphasis on action (except for a great plane crash landing scene)and with a great sense of dark humor and stylish photograghy this film brings to mind the insider view of the mob in Goodfellas.Unlike other recent films with important messages Lord of War tackles a serious topic but also manages to be entertaining.Cage's performance is strong here compared to some of his other films because he doesn't overdo it...cold,crafty,and charismatic he's the riveting center of Lord of War.An ambitious film that succeeds on many levels.
0440224764|5.0|Imagine faking your own death stealing ninety million dollars, changing your name, ID, looks, and leaving your old life behind. That is exactly what Patrick Lanigan did. For four years he got away with it all. He hid in Brazil, always knowing that people were looking for him. Now the biggest story on the news is that the guy everybody thought was dead has been caught. The thing everybody wants to know is where is the money, but even Patrick doesn't know. He is held under many charges, but with a little help from his lawyers, he might be able to sneak his way out of this like he did to his old life before.<br /><br /> Some things I liked about this book is how there is always something happening. With so many clever twists and turns you never know what to expect. The characters fit together and do their part to make the book more exciting. Even though this is my first John Grisham book, I know I'll be reading more books by him. I didn't have very many dislikes for this book. Probably my biggest dislike had to do with the end of Patrick's love life. You'll have to read it to find out what happens!<br /><br /> If you're into mysteries and books with jury trial and lawyers, you would like this book. Also, if you've read The Pact, My Sister's Keeper, or Vanishing Acts, all by Jodi Picoult, you might like this book. Just like in Jodi Picoult's there is a good court trial, but John Grisham's books are a little more mature and serious. I hope you and enjoy!
B000E5N684|3.0|This Ultimate Edition could have been the definitive edition, had it been produced a little differently. <br /> <br />First, with the exception of the two new Sharon Stone items, Intro and Commentary, it is the same as the \\"IcePick\\" Unrated Director's Cut that came out some years ago.  When I mean \\"IcePick\\", I'm talking about the release that came in the clear plastic case with a little bonus metal icepick. <br /> <br />Second, the movie's video and audio quality are also the same as that IcePick version.  Which means passable, but not great. <br /> <br />This is where my biggest gripe with this item is located.  The video and audio quality. <br /> <br />What would have made this a truly \\"Ultimate\\" Edition would have been if they had made it a 2-disc edition, one disc with only the movie, and the other all the bonus features.  Many current releases do it this way. <br /> <br />As it stands, a one-disc version of a movie that is slightly over two hours (2 hours 8 minutes more exact) along with all the bonus material means that the video bitrate of the movie is limited to no more than an average of 5.0 Mbps. <br /> <br />A 2 hour movie can be encoded at 9.8 Mbps (almost the theoretical maximum) if placed entirely on a DVD-9 RSDL disc. <br /> <br />The difference between 9.8 Mbps and 5.0 Mbps is huge, as long as the source material is high enough quality to take advantage.  Since this edition says \\"newly remastered widescreen version\\" I would think the original video quality would be such. <br /> <br />In addition, we are still stuck with Dolby Digital 5.1 448 Kbps for the audio.  But with the extra storage that comes with a two-disc edition, they could have increased the audio quality to DD-EX 6.1 and DTS 6.1 formats. <br /> <br />Had they done that with this \\"Ultimate\\" edition, making it a two-disc extravaganza and increased the video and audio bitrates, this would have truly been the final, must-own version of this film. <br /> <br />So therefore, if you already have an Unrated Director's Cut version of this film, there is no need to purchase this \\"Ultimate\\" edition, unless you absolutely have to have those two extra Sharon Stone features.  The movie itself is the exact same material. <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Coming home from my second shift job one night a couple of weeks ago I found the copy of Illinois that I had recently ordered waiting for me in the mail.  I ordered it on the basis of the 30 second samples and the reviews written about this CD. <br />I put it on my stereo and was captivated from the first moment. <br />I have been a music geek ever since I heard the Beatles as a child and have had my share of the thrills of hearing something <br />\\"REALLY new and different\\" at different stages of the development of rock and modern pop that I have lived through. <br />Sufjan Stevens has given me another one of those moments like the first time I ever heard the Velvet Underground or the first time I ever heard Elvis Costello's \\"Red Shoes\\". Sufjan puts his beautiful melodies in inventive and attention-getting arrangements that had me thinking of people as disparate as Tom Waits and Mike Oldfield. And the emotional content of his songs <br />conveys a genuine tenderness and sensitivity that only a heart of stone would not be touched by.  This guy has definitely  raised the bar for not only indie music but pop music in general <br />(if you can call what Sufjan does \\"pop\\").  After I heard \\"illinois\\" I ordered \\"Michigan\\" which I am growing very fond of. Check Sufjan out. He's the real deal.
B0002S94OS|5.0|killer cd, Lamb of god just rocks out, no dicking around. I especially like the lack of repetitiveness in their song structure, it makes the album hard to get tired of. very good production too for a metal album. Perfect for playing loudly in public through your car stereo when their is preppy rapper kids and other undesirables roaming about. never fails to turn heads. <br /> <br />p.s. - do not mix with alcohol, may result in severe whiplash and/or other neck injuries associated with rappid  <br />banging-of-the-head.

This book is very detailed in mytholoical creatures...I enjoy reading it whenever I'm not doing anything...It will enhance your imagination with colorful pics of extraodinary creatures that might well exist!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|First time watching it I was taken in by the power and emotion of this film. It was disturbing and depressing. I couldn't understand how anybody could actually watch this movie over and over again. A few yrs later I decided to buy the movie with the PI two pack. Heard good things about PI and I figured Requiem was worth seeing again. After seeing it for the 2nd time it wasn't as depressing and disturbing as it was during the 1st viewing. My imagination made it more traumatic for me. Watching it the 2nd time I really got a chance to appreciate the acting (Ellen Burstyn was excellent in this) and the artistic story telling style of the director.
B00000ICD9|4.0|This one is probably one of those real love it or hate it films.  In some ways, throughout, it can be very depressing as a whole family evetually gets wiped out one way or another.  But it's depictions of Heaven and Hell are visual marvels unlike many movies I have ever seen.  There is the ultimate romance here - chasing ones family and soul mate through the afterlife, but like vampire movie -it's seems to make up its own rules about spirituality, Heaven, Hell, suicide to move the plot along.  If you look past these things however, it's a visual and romantic feast.
B00000099Y|5.0|=H= and the title track alone are worth having this album for. Best served loudly and preferably live.
1400079276|4.0|This is a stylish and compelling thriller full of mythic symbolism, classical music and talking cats.  Our 15 year old hero runs away from home and across Japan with nothing but a backpack full of emotional baggage and an Oedipal complex that would kill a horse.  His coming of age, living in a small library, triggers a psychological fantasy where memory, desire and reality battle it out.  This novel is quite creepy in parts but unputdownable.  It's like a Stephen King novel produced by Studio Ghibli.  A mesmerising ride.   <br />
0930289528|4.0|in my last purchasing spree along with The Elder Staves (Steven Oliverez), and enjoyed them both, though the differences in 'heroes' from reading one after another was kinda strange.  Recommend this, even if you're not usually into 'comics'.
0451196716|4.0|The Long Walk I would guess is either one of those books you love or dislike. I read this sucker and still have this book. Depressing at times and eerie at others, its one of those books that I can say I won't forget. I read it and liked it, though the ending is different from what I had expected I guess. I'd say try it out and see how it flies so to speak.
B00003CXCD|5.0|It's difficult not to have at least some, possibly subliminal, awareness of this classic and its imagery. Princess Audrey losing a slipper; Greg and Audrey on a scooter in Rome; Audrey bashing the guy with the guitar; Greg and Audrey at the end, back to Royal and Commoner; and surely - courtesy of \\"Only You\\" and Robert Downey's fine recreation with Marisa Tomei - the dare to risk hands being bitten off when put by the untruthful into the Bocca della Verita (Mouth of Truth) and Audrey's wild, coltish reaction to Greg's silly amputation mime (hand retracted into sleeve on extraction from the Mouth). These images have long since been absorbed into most people's cinematic vocabulary of the timeless and delightful: quite rightly so. Some of us have even been in the Eternal City on a fast-paced weekend break and still found time for furtive indulgence in a bit of our own movie-recreation magic, down at La Bocca with a camera on timer... <br /> <br />But come back, please, to this lovely film and you will find something that's more than the sum of admittedly exquisite parts. Dalton Trumbo wrote this under a Black-List-dodging cover, for a start; couple this with Director William Wyler's known insistence for precision-engineered scripting and you know you're going to be presented with a beautifully-shaped and paced experience. The casting is - of course - pitch-perfect, with Audrey justifying the latter iconics (which I've often considered a bit overdone in relation to her overall contribution) with a tremendous portrait of her character's initially innocent, fragmented, wrenched character, the evolution over the course of her self-discovering \\"holiday\\" and, most poignantly, the mature and genuinely regal way she conducts herself at the end. <br /> <br />The film looks wonderful, naturally; location-work in Rome throughout will tend to do that for your movie. But you may not remember just how erotic the wet, underlit kiss on the Tiber's night-time banks really is until youcome back. Or how funny the recurring shtick with Eddie Albert's bohemian photographer is. Or how spot-on the satire of the paparazzi is, for then and now. Edith Head does one of her finest fashion-jobs ever in this: not just Audrey, but all of them are dressed to perfection for their characters and their developments. Even the damned haircut is perfect! <br /> <br />\\"Tragi-comic\\" is partly right for the final impact of the story. It's ultimately very uplifting, though, in both theme and structure. Both Audrey and Greg gain something permanent and perfect, even as they retire to their respective sides of the rope barrier. And how lovely that, in so articulate a film, the script calls for them to convey the final truths they've learned, what they've lost - and what they (and we) will have with us to enjoy forever - all of this is brought to life without words, in the looks they share at the end, Greg and Audrey acting their hearts out from their stillness whilst the state occasion goes on around them. The implied confidence in Greg's public question and Audrey's response near the start of the scene, along with the covert handing back by the cheeky reporter and snapper of the candid photographs taken on Audrey's incognito escapades, constitute some of the least cynical and most generous gestures ever realised on film - everybody finds nobility at the end. <br /> <br />What a sweet and redeeming masterpiece this is! It's one of those films I'd cheerfully go and inhabit. Early on, Greg takes a \\"drunken\\" (actually drugged) Audrey up the outside courtyard stairs to his Rome apartment. In the night-light, she sways back to knock someone's door, just down a short flight from Greg's entrance; but he catches her hand (you should watch hands throughout this film) just before she can smack the door, twirling her up and away with comic grace, as if they're dancing. Well, I want to be the person who lives behind that door.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not my favorite Radiohead album (That would be \\"The Bends\\",) not even my second favorite (That would be \\"Pablo Honey\\",) this album still rates a five and still ranks high and above the normal fare available at your local music store. Radiohead did get pretentious with \\"Kid A\\" and, to a certain extent, \\"Amnesiac,\\" but that wasn't the case with these three albums I've mentioned. This is music for the medulla oblongata. Roll with it.
B00065MDRW|5.0|King Crimson's 'In The Court of The Crimson King\\" is more than  masterpiece, it simply transcended the boundaries of music at the time it was recorded - 1969. <br /> <br />The album starts off with 21st Century Schizoid Man\\".  The band wastes no time in getting the listener hooked.  This song is manic, highly metallic and heavy, and kind of jazzy in parts.  This song was the song that jumpstarted the \\"progressive rock\\" period of the early 1970's.  Although, keep in mind that Robert Fripp (and most likely the other founding members of King Crimson) have never considered King Crimson to be a progressive rock band.  With this piece, in 1969, you would have to have termed them an \\"experimental band\\", and that would have summed things up. <br /> <br />The next song is \\"I Talk To The Wind\\".  I like this song and it's a nice relaxed tune after thundering through \\"Schizoid Man\\".  This song is awash with flutes, soft guitars, and backing mellotrons and faint choral passages.  Truly a pleasant tune.  The drumming is interesting in its non-aggressive fashion. <br /> <br />The next tune, \\"Epitaph\\", is a war protest song  if there ever was one.  The music is magnificent and Greg Lake's voice is simply angelic with passion and just the right volume.  This song is highly emotionally charged and you can feel the poignant message behind the song.  The band is \\"on fire\\" with this song, as their songwriting was at a peak with this song. <br /> <br />\\"Moonchild\\", a long improv, is the next track.  I have always wanted to like this song, but it's simply not too interesting.  Parts of the guitar improvisation is interesting, but it's not enough.  The other players could have thrown in some off-key melltron wizardry to give the piece a little more color and dynamics.  The song is worth a listen, but you'll rarely come back to this one. <br /> <br />The title track is a superb piece.  The dynamics and sublime nature of the song make it a very interesting listen.  I find this song to be among King Crimson's darkest and most brooding.  The vocals are great and the backing guitars and mellotrons set a great mood on this tune.  Again, the drumming from Michael Giles is stunning. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is definitely worth buying.  It is a rock classic and no CD or album collection should be without it. <br />   <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Probably one of the best shows I have ever watched.  Saw the movie Serenity first which was good.  A friend told me that the movie was based on a TV series that was canceled by FOX.  I then watched all the episodes on DVD and was completely hooked.  Unfortunately another example of a quality show canceled by Fox who would prefer putting out trash for the quick buck.  Its too bad HBO or another of the Cable channels didn't pick this up.  I highly recommend this show.  You do not need to be a SCIFI nut to enjoy.  The writing/stories/actors/dialog are all excellent.  I was sad after I watched the last episode realizing there were no more episodes to come.
6304779607|1.0|I didn't even get through half the movie before I turned it off. It was boring, poor quality, cheesy, and the acting sucked. I was so fustrated with the movie, I sold it on ebay the next day. I am a HUGE Stallone fan and I couldn't believe this movie was such a disapointment.
B00004Z459|1.0|God, I sure hope not.  They throw a heavy and, though slightly catchy, predictable and overused power chord progression against some emo rap and you guys call it a \\"classic\\"?  Seriously, turn off your crappy radio for a few days and find some good music.  Into rap?  There's a huge amount of underground hip-hop artists that deserve recognition (blackstar, sage francis, atmosphere, aesop rock, apathy, esoteric, living legends, and on and on and on).  Into catchy guitars?  Queens of the Stone Age, Eagles of Death Metal, Kings of Leon, the Strokes, Frank Black, the Hives, the Cardigans (pre- Long Gone), the Coral.  Believe it or not, there IS better music out there.
B00005JOE8|3.0|I saw V for Vendetta and I liked it, but it was really violent.  I'm not a fan of violence.  The acting was good and the story was good, but the violence made it hard to watch.  Especially the throat slashings.  That's not pleasant. <br />Otherwise, good movie.
B00005JOE8|1.0|First of all, don't insult WWII veterans.  That's not cool. <br />Second, WWII veterans were fighting AGAINST what Hitler stood for, not for it. <br />Third, very few (if any) WWII veterans saw V for Vendetta.  I don't know if you noticed or not, but it's not their cup of tea. <br />And dudes, if you want entertainment see something else.  I could barely keep m y eyes open.
B000286S8S|4.0|Most of the hits are here.  But as a completist, I was left wanting more.  What happened to \\"Humans Being\\" (a solid Sammy effort) from the \\"Twister\\" Soundtrack? Or \\"Me Wise Magic\\"? And, like other reviewers, I'm disappointed that nothing from Gary Cherone made it into the collection (though I guess it couldn't be called \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" then).  \\"Without You\\" from VH3 was a great song, and \\"Fire in the Hole\\" from the same (and the \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" soundtrack) would have added to it.  A good collection, but missing some key tracks.   FOUR STARS
6304884419|5.0|This is a semi autobiography of Chazz palminteri who wrote this movie based on his play.the most interesting part to me was Calogero's racist friends Slick and Crazy Mario they chased that bus and they got worse as teenagers.Sonny was a better friend because he and C weren't prejudiced.But great music,songs and scenes in this movie I was totally intertained.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Ugh, this is one of the worst movies I have ever suffered through.  Watching this rancid exercise in self~indulgence is like being trapped in a car on a long road trip with a boring film nerd who just won't shut up.  I have been told that a lot of this tripe is \\"intentionally bad\\", which is apparently a good thing, but nevertheless intentionally bad is still bad.  It's evidently based on all the B movies Tarantino has seen, so I guess it's trash stealing from trash.  Avoid unless you're the kind of person who enjoys watching someone else play video games.

0802130208|5.0|If I'm being sent to Angola (the prison or the nation) and get to bring just two books?  As of today, I go with Confederacy and an ESV Bible (we'll make it the Reformation Study Bible in black leather).      After 805 reviews here, I have nothing new to add.  Just joining my voice to the recommendation list, and sharing my own small experience with this wonderful book.    I was up til 4:30am reading it last night and only got to p. 39, between the laughter, and wanting to re-read a well crafted paragraph over and over.  Kind of like the very first time you popped R.E.M. 'Murmur' into your CD player -- you just had to listen to each sng a hundred times.      The interesting part to this experience last night --  I had just heard a talk by Anne Lamott about her Xian faith and being an artists.  Wonderful stuff.  Met her afterwards and bought her new acclaimed book, Plan B.  Well, I didn't even crack the cover of the (certainly amazing) Lamott book all night, because that would require pulling me away from Confederacy.         Take David Brooks' DNA and splice its best parts with Flannery O'Connor's.  Add in some Jaques Maritain and P.J. O'Rourke.  Take the child that results and drop him into Uptown New Orleans  -- when science can achieve this we may finally get another comic novel approaching this.  Until then, we have Confederacy, and nothing else.    As has been noted in several of these reviews, Toole was a college instructor in New Orleans in the late 60s.  He wrote this novel and saw it rejected by all the major publishers.  He killed himself in response, age 32.  So his mother took the manuscript and forced it upon Walker Percy in 1976, who thought she was silly, but gave a look to the first page only because he rashly promised her he would.  He said he knew quickly he was reading the best comic novel of the 20th century.  Through his intervention it was finally published in 1980, more than ten years after Toole's death.  It immediately won the Pulitzer.    Its main character Ignatius Reilly is a New Orleanian freak through and through (his sole bus ride to Baton Rouge made him vomit).  He may be the only 300 pound sloth in history to wear an undersized lumberjack shirt on Canal St.   Percy has called him a mad Thomas Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas, all rolled into one.     Disclaimer: It is roughly R-rated.  Not good for many homeschooled 13 year olds.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon's book was one of the unique ones that I have read. The story of an autistic boy who tries to solve the mystery of the killing of the dog is many things: a comedy, mystery, child outlook and a sad story. I did not know that there were two versions of the book and read the children's version and was immediately captivated. It was sad that it did not make the short list of the Booker in 2003, though it won the Whitbread prize that year. I felt that it was better than books that made the Booker shortlist such as \\"The Good Doctor\\" and \\"Vernon God Little\\". Mark Haddon is an author of children's books and I was puzzled about his crossover book. The complete story is through the eyes of the boy, Christopher. Christopher decides to become a detective and discover who killed the dog. It is through Christopher's limitations as a narrator that the book finds its freedoms. Christopher cannot read facial expressions fluently. For him, the human face is an embarrassing zone: too personal, busy, subtle. Like the sun, it is dangerous for him to stare at it for too long.  <br /> <br />Autistic people are not easy subjects for novelists. Their interests are prescribed, their experiences static, their interaction with others limited. Haddon ingeniously uses Christopher's admiration for Sherlock Holmes to lead him out of this stasis, not to effect some miraculous \\"cure\\", but so that a story can happen. Detective fiction, relying on the accumulation of material facts, is the only fiction that makes sense to Christopher. As he collects facts relating to the death of the dog, he unwittingly pieces together a jigsaw that reveals to the reader the lies, grief and evasions of his parents' lives. Christopher sees everything, remembers everything, but cannot prioritise - cannot sift out what most of us regard as important. On the day he is told his mother is dead, he records his Scrabble score, and notes that supper was spaghetti with tomato sauce. But he isn't callous or indifferent. He can cope with facts, with concrete detail; emotions confuse and alarm him.  <br /> <br />\\"This will not be a funny book,\\" says Christopher. \\"I cannot tell jokes because I do not understand them.\\" But it is a funny book, as well as a sad one. But there is comfort as well as sorrow. Christopher's innocence makes him vulnerable, but it protects him too. At the end, when order is restored, we see that he is a touchstone for adult behaviour. Those concerned with his welfare have to learn to temper their emotional needs round his autistic inability to compromise. This is one of most imaginative books of the year with a unique perspective of a child's mind. People have complained that the book is not great literature. Granted that it does not have beautiful language, but it more than makes up for it in the way the story is put together and draws the reader. I read both versions of the book and find both brilliant. Highly recommended to adults and to kids.  <br />
B00007LTIA|5.0|Released in late 1973, this album would come to be known as THE concept album in prog rock, and is perhaps the most loathed recording by individuals that feel compelled to attack the genre.  One of the most significant criticisms leveled at the album is that the pieces are simply just too long, and that the sheer length strained the band's compositional resourcefulness to the breaking point.  In short, Yes was viewed as \\"milking\\" a theme for too long.  In contrast to this view, I feel that the album is absolutely perfect (it is a personal favorite), and would not change a single note.  Then again, I am a huge Yes fan, and in no way objective.<br /><br />Written by Steve and Jon during candlelight sessions held while on the road, Tales from Topographic Oceans is comprised of four, inter-related movements that were apparently based upon Shastric scripture.  The pieces themselves can largely be divided into two spacey, more subdued movements including The Revealing Science of God and The Remembering, along with two, more adventurous pieces including The Ancient and the remarkable closing movement, Ritual.  Ritual features an amazing bass solo by Chris (on his trademark trebly sounding Rickenbacker) and the live version of this track on the Yesshows album (1980) is truly something to behold.  One other item of note is that Squire used a fretless bass on The Remembering, although he does not play it like a fretless (i.e. with lots of glissandos).  I even have to admit that Rick turns in some nice performances here, in spite of his general dislike of the entire album (he left Yes after Tales..., only to rejoin for the Going for the One album).  His mini-moog solo on The Revealing Science of God is excellent and the loads of mellotron throughout the four works really make this album work for me.<br /><br />The remastering effort by Rhino is remarkable and the CD package boasts a huge booklet loaded with color photos and informational tidbits that will prove useful for old and new fans alike.  One of the most thrilling aspects of the new and improved \\"Tales\\" is the addition of a very spacey intro to The Revealing Science of God - a long piece made even longer!  The restored cover art took me back to a time  when I first heard this album (on vinyl no less) as a teenager.  Although the two bonus studio run-though tracks are cool, they really do not add much to the overall listening experience.<br /><br />Although I could easily go on forever, raving about this album I won't - this is a review after all, not a bloody essay.  Suffice it to say that this will provide one of the more challenging and ultimately rewarding listening experiences you may encounter.  So ignore all of the negative stuff people say about it and give it a spin.  Highly recommended along with all Yes albums released from 1971-1977 (The Yes Album through Going for the One).like.

B00000I8NC|5.0|Can't say enough. This is a masterpiece, pure and simple. I'm a fan of the \\"post-rock\\" genre; Explosions, Mogwai, Do Make Say Think, etc. In my opinion -- these bands, though I love them deeply in my heart, just can't morph into the plane Godspeed YBE! often reaches.  Well, that isn't entirely true; Mogwai, for example, CAN, but their problem is they never quite do it for an extended period of time. For 30 straight minutes, \\"Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada!\\" provides meditative, thought-provoking music that is at once indispensible for its musical prowess, but really, a masterwork because it manages to evoke an unprecedented amount of self-induced abstract thought.    Godspeed YBE! seems to be classified as pretentious or self-indulgent more often than I'd prefer to see. My response to that? Who cares. Is the band's intent obvious? Without question. Attacking the current state of the world (musically) in all its missteps and overall anguish is not a difficult thing to do, in theory. Anyone with a brain (and perhaps a heart) can look around and witness the contrast between what Humanity has become, and what Humanity could be. What makes Godspeed YBE! so wonderful, however, is that they do it properly -- with intellect, sincerity, honesty, devestation, and a general sense of idealism that is so far from currently being met one can't help but be moved during the album's apt running time. They do it on such a large scale that it really defies description; very few pieces of modern music seem to be able to so perfectly capture the sort of existential emotions that are as large as Life itself. Here, we have them.    So really, where one might criticize Godspeed YBE!'s overall intention, I would merely say that it's done with such profundity that any real sense of self-indulgence is transcended because this is, in my opinion, selfless music. It's just a matter of perception. Like other great pieces of art, Godspeed YBE! is finding the utmost brilliance possible within an existence that doesn't come close to meeting it. Within the despair is a gleaming sense of hope that noone can take away from us. This is not depressing music -- it is empowering and cathartic.    \\"Slow Riot\\" proves to be my favorite Godspeed YBE! album because I believe here they mastered their formula, somewhat described above. Musically, it is mesmerizing. \\"Moya\\" is my favorite piece the band has ever written, and while \\"Blaise Bailey Finnegan III\\" isn't quite as memorable or pop-natured, it is easily the more evocatively constructed work. The band's previous album, \\"F#A# Infinity\\", was heavy but erratic, and never reached any sort of climax the way \\"Slow Riot\\" manages to. Likewise, \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists\\", while providing some moments of musical genius, is by-and-large a far less emotive and cerebral a work. \\"Yanqui Y.X.O.\\", quite frankly, just doesn't do it for me, and even more so than this album, finds its merit simply within what it's trying to convey opposed to a good deal of musical warrant.    I'm going off the deep end here but I just want to say that this album is close to me -- perhaps more so than any other. Godspeed YBE! might be my favorite band if only for this album -- as I said, their others, despite flashes of Godliness, are too flawed.  The band's spin-off group, \\"A Silver Mt. Zion\\", fares better overall, and anyone who finds a home within Godspeed YBE!'s realm of music should go buy every one of SMZ's works. Nonetheless, this is a dreamy, romantic, introspective look at the world around us, and endlessly impresses me each time I listen to it.
B00000IL67|2.0|Who would want to buy this?  If you don't know Alice Cooper, why spend the money for a small sampling that doesn't do him justice?  If you are a fan, you already have most of this stuff.  If you're new to Alice, my advice is to start with Killer, then Billion Dollar Babies, then Love it to Death.  Those aren't my favorite albums in order, but it's a good start.
B00065MDS6|5.0|It just occurred to me that this, the least file-able album by King Crimson, finds itself completely without representation on the fairly recently issued  \\"The 21st Century Guide to King Crimson, Volume One 1969 - 1974\\".  Now, why is that?<br /><br />During its recording, Fripp was famously and curiously preoccupied with the mammoth undertaking of producing Centipede's \\"Septober Energy\\". With its ginormous number of musicians, some finding themselves pressed into service on \\"Lizard\\" and following behind the original line up -- with its now precedent-setting break-up -- the constituents of this King Crimson did not linger long therein. Coupled with the complexity of being the band's second first album, so to speak, problems are almost painfully apparent. Especially when compared with the near-flawless coherence and sheen of their debut. But concealed within its border-line wretched excess, melodramatic film-score cliches and medieval preoccupations, \\"Lizard\\" retains an exotic and even hurtful allure.<br /><br />There are some inherently moving Cor Anglais passages amid the battlefields of the title track, and some outright hilarious lyrics in the Beatles send-up, \\"Happy Family\\". But more importantly it has been said -- and written -- that it was during work on \\"Lizard\\" that the initial ideas which would some years later flourish on \\"Lark's Tongues in Aspic\\" found their origin, here within the folds of \\"The Peacock's Tale\\" and strewn hither and yon amid the debris left by \\"The Battle of Glass Tears\\".<br /><br />Commercial success has a tendency to set in motion any and all sorts of indulgence, hubris and countless hours of bad work. Setbacks tend to either force an end or force another solution. \\"Lizard\\" exists on that curious ledge that intimates the outlines of failure. Yet stepping off that particular ledge ultimately lands one within earshot of another solution. Here, the will and desire to reach that most elusive place where great and powerful music can exist is everywhere and nowhere. And as such, \\"Lizard\\" proves to be that most crucial and pivotal work in the catalog of a band that remains always so unsettled: music that is not an end, but the means to a future stronger still.And as such, \\"Lizard\\" proves to be that most crucial and pivotal work in the catalog of a band that remains always so unsettled: music that is not an end, but the means to a future stronger still.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|After hearing waivering reveiws about the film and it's theatrical release I found myself some what excited to see what all the hype was about as well as to see if Mr. Roth's 2nd attept at a good horror film was more successful than his 1st... <br /> <br />     Over the past few months I have been reading in magazines, reports that \\"Eli Roth's Hostel is making the audience run out of the theatre from pure discust\\" (which of corse made me even more eager to see the film) .... now 2 month's later after buying the film I relize that the gore statement is somewhat over-rated (wait to let me explain why!). I must confess that one of my true passions is to watch all sorts horror films (low-budget, big-budget, Chinese & Japanese, gory, suspence/thrillers) whatever! it doesnt matter what kind, if there is a horror film I have either seen or want to see it, BUT back to the subject at hand... seeing all sorts of horror film's, I know what to look at in one, and what Hostel brings has nothing unique,... Itilian & French horror film's do the same thing as Hostel does with ALOT more actual horror, any horror film with a decent budget what so ever can make a film THAT gory and un-easing, it doesnt take a brilliant mind, it doesnt take great acting, all it takes is a few million and a somewhat twisted mind. One good thing about this film was the .. (BEWARE.. SPOILER LIES AHEAD!) part where the Californian escapes with the one-eyeballed Asian, it was somewhat suspenceful as well as fast-paced, (unlike the first thirty minutes of boobs, sex & drugs!) <br /> <br />Overall all Roth's 2nd effort is an improvment from Cabin fever (his 1st film) BUT he is still a bit more than a little un-educated in the true definition of horror, and very far still from some of the great horror minds (directors) that are still around today as well as some that are six feet under ground  <br /> <br />Grade: C
0440237688|4.0|This was one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.  It was clearly well-deserving of the Newbery gold.  The plot attempts to paint a picture of a perfect world.  But as the plot develops, the reader sees aspects of this society which are more characteristic of the brutal reign of the Third Reich than the understanding and compassionate community which appears on the surface.  The fundamental problem with Jonas's world is that it's a \\"perfect\\" world in imperfect hands. <br /> <br />The story introduces enough twists and turns to make it comparable to any film ever made by Alfred Hitchcock or M. Night Shyamalan.  The ending of this book seems to have been hastily put together and was very lacking in terms of conclusion and continuity.  In short, it leaves the reader empty-handed so-to-speak.  And that was the book's primary flaw which I observed. <br /> <br />Overall, this is easily one of the best children's books I have ever read, and I have every intention of re-reading it.

B00004STUL|5.0|While I thought this movie was silly ... and the script was particulary ridiculous ... also the performances were competent but not transcendant ... and the whole identity confusion thing was unnecessary, but I guess when the script and story are so thin you have to find something to fill the 90 minutes. So yes, this movie is severely flawed and not worth anyone's time to see it, but (and it's a big but) you can see the genius of Michael Bay working his way through the film. Little things: the placement of a trash can, the bangles on Tea Leoni's wrist, the use of slow motion, when it doesn't seem called for. The rest of it is really intangible and I don't know whether he did this before or after that terrific Lionel Richie video he did, but there's a certain uncomprehensible quality that just screams ... Bay = Genius. So again, I would see this only if you consider yourself a Bayophile. Even then, you'll not like it, but you'll appreciate what Bay tried to do, even though everyone else let him down.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Vitalogy is the least strait-forward yet most compelling album released in the 90's. What Pearl Jam did here with glaring success was to take the strait forward concept album and toss it to create songs completely individual in sound and structure and then put them together with only similar production values to hold them together. The mood swings lunges left and right, the lyrics are vague metaphors and the record opens with an opus to Vinyl records and closes with a little boy saying he likes being spanked more than hugged.<br /><br />Pearl Jam didn't impress or stand out to those of us outside the \\"radio\\" music world, this is an artist album for those who appreciate that \\"pop\\" doesn't mean good and \\"artistic\\" doesn't mean inaccessible.<br /><br />A revelation. It's a shame they deviated so far on future recordings.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Explosions! Beckinsale! Toupees! Affleck! Squinting! Harnett! This film is like riding in the backseat of a '71 Toronado with a hopped-up Tom Sizemore behind the wheel on a humid summer night in Jacksonville, Florida. You sure as heck don't know where you're going, you feel a little sick and you can't tell Mr. Sizemore anything he doesn't already know. I, for one, salute Michael Bay. He's got what it takes people. He knows how to tell a story around an historical event and keeps the audience scratching their heads. He deftly weaves a tapestry of anguish, pain and confusion ... like Affleck must have looked when Bay was directing him. So, to all those people out there who say Michael Bay is nothing but a connected hack with gorgeous flowing hair and one of those whispery beards that make you think about Peter Horton in thirtysomething, I won't argue the point with you. What I will say is that Mr. Bay is a survivor and he's made of teflon. Teflon with touchable locks ... something we can all aspire to, right?
8590379825|5.0|Reading the first PiL left us with that hard-to-believe-it-could-get-any-better impression.<br /><br />But Roberto did it again and surprised us with another 5-stars gem!<br /><br />The Lua language has evolved (a lot!) and version 5.1 brings new mechanisms such as a full modules/packaging support system, tighter control over garbage collection, new (minor but significant) syntax notations, all of which justify this second edition. For the 5.0 user the book also offers plenty of new examples, such as graph management, extensive string content manipulation and a complete multithreaded C system using different Lua states in each thread.<br /><br />Lua itself would be a good enough reason to buy another book written by its creator, but PiL 2 is much more than one could expect. The book is full of brilliant solutions and tackles a wide variety of computing challenges, in the best Knuth style as hardly seen ever since.<br /><br />The text not only shows spotless academic rigour and consistency, but it is also astonishingly clear, pleasant to read and carefully crafted and lapidated by a writer who learned English as a second language.<br /><br />A bedside book!

Watching it for the 1st time was like being immersed in a magical land.. <br /> <br />Timeless and without a place....a true fairytale! <br /> <br />It is a bit dark (as most true folk/fairytales are) but that just gives it enough of an edge to make it that much more so complex. <br /> <br />A beautiful, delightful and enchantment!
B00006JU7T|5.0|The story of police officer Frank Serpico who, practically single-handedly, took a stand against the enormous corruption within the NYPD, and paid for it dearly, is still fascinating and still relevant; and thanks to a killer performance by Al Pacino, this biopic by Sidney Lumet stands the test of time. Serpico isn't quite as timeless as Pacino's and Lumet's second collaboration - the classic Dog Day Afternoon (also based on a true story, but with a bit more liberties taken) - but it rises entirely thanks to Pacino, who turned Serpico into a universal icon of integrity and idealism, with his beard, long hair and penetrating stare, as a hero who fights within the establishment and against it. <br />  <br />Along with The Godfather saga and Dog Day Afternoon this is one of Pacino's greatest performances, and one that earned him an Oscar nomination, and helped make him one of the prominent American actors of the 70's, alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman. Serpico was a part of the revolution in American cinema in that period, which was becoming younger, darker and grittier - and like films such as Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Dog Day Afternoon, Straw Dogs, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Midnight Cowboy - it stands the test of time. It's definitely not the best of that list, and it's not high on the list of all-time essential classics; but it's fascinating, gritty, realistic drama, with an important message, and for Pacino's performance alone it's worth every minute.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Come on, people.  This is a STORY -- a beautiful love story, a tragic, grief-inducing love story.  I'm amazed at the narrow-minded individuals who feel it necessary to judge the characters and their actions. (I'm gratified to surmise that, based on the galaxy of stars accorded this work of art, Mr. Lee is, for the most part, \\"preaching to the choir\\".) For those who were willing to experience this film with open minds, I can't imagine that it didn't tear their hearts out.  Ang Lee, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal made these people REAL  I am bereaved at the lost opportunity for a full loving life for these characters, and nothing that occurs to them or the tragic \\"collateral damage\\" of their relationship stretches credulity.  I know from personal experience that you DON'T choose whom you love, and love IS a force of nature. It grabs you, stomps on you and leaves you unable to control yourself in its power.  It can't be denied without  such life-shattering consequences as the ones so poignently depicted by these two incredibly talented young actors.  I've watched the DVD more times than I can count, and scenes steal into my mind constantly.  I have to find other diversions, or I catch myself weeping for Ennis and Jack at the most inopportune moments.  This is truly one of the most affecting films I've ever seen, and if anyone tries to take away my DVD and prevent me from indulging in my obsession with this incredible story there will be dire consequences!
B00080Z53O|5.0|Controversial issues can be approached humanely and aesthetic ways.  The SEA INSIDE is one particular film that accomplishes the daunting task of confronting euthanasia without overly politicizing the issue, but rather observing the beauty of life.  In this case, the real life of Ramon Sam Pedro (Javier Bardem) who became a quadriplegic after diving into an undertow in 1968.  For 26 years he struggled to live, but constantly contemplated death and the right to die with dignity.  This is the story of his 30-year struggle.<br /><br />The SEA INSIDE revolves around the people who have had to take care of Ramon as well as those who want to fulfill his wishes.  The movie is a circle of conflict between his family who refuse to accept Ramon's desire to die, older brother, Jose (Celso Buello), sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Riviera), nephew, Javi (Tomar Novas), and an admirer, Rosa (Lola Duenas), and the people who want to prove his case to the government for the right to die, his lawyer, Julia (Belen Rueda), and activist-friend, Gene (Clara Segura).  In this midst of conflicting views, Ramon harbors intimate relationships with Julia and Rosa in quite unique ways.  While interviewing Ramon, Julia takes a liking towards him despite that fact that she is married to German (Alberto Jimenzes), a friendship develops, but is only disrupted when she too suffers a debilitating state.  She contemplates death as well.  Ramon also befriends Rosa, a single mother of two young boys, who happens to become mesmerized with him after seeing him on television, but her relationship is almost fatherly or brotherly like.<br /><br />There are only little inklings of religious and political tones in the film, the courtroom scene, and the extremely funny segment where a quadriplegic priest visits Ramon.  But the film speaks loudly towards what Ramon's plight, not to be a burden to the people who have to take care of him, and the means it will take to achieve his ultimate goal - to have the one who really loves him who will carry out his wish.<br /><br />Director Alejandro Amenabar did a beautiful job at portraying Ramon's life.  The most exquisite scenes are the dream and flashbacks scenes, which Amenabar recreates from real life images of the real Ramon and his poetic renderings that were published shortly before his death.  In addition, the seascape is the highlight of the film as well as the narrative.  The DVD has interesting commentary by Amenabar that accompanies scenes of the film as well as the actual making of the film and screenplay by Amenabar and Mateo Gil.<br /><br />The SEA INSIDE is a thought provoking film that questions mortality.

B00005JNQA|4.0|It's always a nice surprise when movies turn out better-than-expected. The Interpreter, thanks to Nicole Kidman, was not just thoughtful, but involving. As with anything having Sean Penn in it, it was somewhat top-heavy in the 'message' department, but Kidman's elfin grace saved the day. Her portrait of a 'white' woman-and fair-haired as well; which kind of drives home the point-whose 'home' is a country where white skin is a cause of social displacement, discrimination and alienation, was understated and therefore effective. By comparion, Penn was ponderous and colorless; which is possibly as it should have been. His character, despite a contrived background that served mainly as a tool for some contemplative philosophy of life and death, remained essentially shallow and undemanding.<br /><br />The pacing of the story was uneven, but in this instance that was an asset. There was too much heavy stuff in here, which required some down-time on the part of the audience. All in all, the dosage was well measured and applied judiciously.<br /><br />For those who wonder, after they saw the movie, just what exactly was the 'point', or what it was all 'about'-apart from it being a political polemic, which, of course and sadly, it was to a large extend...<br /><br />Well, it's all in the ending-which in this movie does wrap things up, showing up the dismal and near-uncrossable gulf that will always exist between people who have something to live for and those who basically don't.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP

It's pretty raw, earthy, and bluesy, compared to their progressive period that started in the early 1970's. I aquired the newest remaster of THIS WAS about a year ago, and it seems that they have tamed the very shrill high frequencies that were on the mid 80's issue because it really hurt your ears back then. None of these songs are really among my favorite Tull material, but still the album as a whole is quite satisfying nonetheless. Just try THIS WAS and I bet you'll really like it. Enjoy!!!

And while the holy grail fetish is easy enough to ignore, official church doctrine has many times been enforced with violence. So I think it's a good thing that this novel has gotten many people to question the validity of blindly accepting dogma.

When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film.

There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork. <br /> <br />The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains.

Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy  called simply, \\"Kid,\\" who Dick and Tess take under their wing. <br /> <br /> The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed. <br /> <br />The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those \\"faults\\" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Johnny Cash is one of America's most legendary musicians. One of those rare artists that manage to transcend the genre they're moving in. Although Cash is unmistakably a country artists he always managed to appeal to a much broader audience.  In the fifties he had much appeal to the R&R audience of Elvis and Roy Orbison. In the sixties he became part of the protest generation because of his outlaw image and prison records.  In the nineties he came back courtesy of Rick Rubin. He was then embraced by both the alternative audience and the gansta rappers. At the MTV video awards Snoop Dogg paid homage to him, and numerous rockers took on his songs as he did with them. A movie on his life was just waiting to happen.    In Walk The Line director James Mangold takes a pretty straight forward approach to telling the Cash story. The movie follows a chronological path to the Folsom Prison concert. The registration of this concert would become his most enduring and biggest selling records. Joaquin Phoenix makes a convincing Johnny Cash. His posture, expression and way of handling himself seem to bring Cash back to life. Reese Witherspoon makes a formidable partner. Throughout the movie the interplay between them is thrilling to see. The romantic story of Johnny Cash and June Carter seems cut for Hollywood and certainly rubs of on these fine actors. Both Joaquin and Reese sing themselves in this movie, a daring choice that works out fine. Although the voice of Phoenix takes some getting used to his deliverance, timbre and timing often come awfully close to the real deal sparing us the discomfort seeing an actor lip singing  to a dead man's voice. Witherspoon actually sings better than June.    The way the story is told is somewhat disappointing. Johnny Cash was in life a dark and brooding personality, a man of extremes. Often torn between self-destruction and the need for redemption, consumed by drugs and his past, battling between his love for June and his hatred for himself,attracted to both sin and purity, Cash was not an easy man by any means. This ongoing conflict fails to surface in its totality throughout the movie. It almost seems as if Mangold took away some of the sharpest edges to make the movie more easy on us. This takes away some of the depth the movie could have had. Mangold chooses to focus on the romance and the music. Cash's fascination with scripture and self-destruction or his youth trauma remain safely in the background of this love story. Although this does deliver an entertaining movie it's not the definite bio-pic it could have been.
B000E33VWW|1.0|Regardless of the book 'In Cold Blood's stand-alone merits, I found this to be the most annoying and tedious movie that I have had the misfortune of watching in the last five years. Never an exciting moment, the main character's strange pitch of voice drove me crazy within 30 seconds of first hearing it. If you like extremely shallow and dull 'documentaries' then by all means buy this film right away! If you appreciate excitement and characters you do not want to do away with, go elsewhere, ANY where else...
0679422714|2.0|I hoped that Amazon.com would have exercised a little caution in writing a review for this Biography.  Yes, it's a sexy looking book with a sexy cover, and fun to read.  However, it's largely HISTORICALLY INACCURATE, especially the bit about Chiang Kai-shek letting the Communists go during the long retreat.  Many of the facts that Jung presents the reader with are disputed by many Chinese historians.  Round-table discussions have been held at a few historical conferences to focus mainly on the validity of facts that Jung uses.  If you're looking for a fun and interesting read that may or not be a load of inaccurate dung, read this book.  If you are more inclined towards a historically accurate book, I would suggest Jonathan Spence's \\"Mao Zedong\\".
B000003KMM|4.0|Okay, so \\"Major League\\" won't rate as one of the greatest comedies or baseball movies of all time. Still, this film is a must for all baseball enthusiasts. While Tom Berenger and Corbin Bernsen do admirable jobs, it's really Charlie Sheen, of all actors, who steals this enjoyable movie.  <br /> <br />The comedy is low, most of the time, but it doesn't dwell on the scatalogical, as most comedies for the past few decades have. And you'll never listen to \\"Wild Thing\\" the same way again. <br /> <br />
B00003CXRP|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Over View<br /><br />Tom Hanks (one of the best actors ever and my personal favorite) is Chuck who is a workaholic. During Xmas he decides to work and is shipwrecked. He has to survive and tries to get back home.<br /><br />Why it is good.<br /><br />It is a simple story. A majority of the film features Tom by himself on the island. He can hold the screen with no other actors, just by himself. Chuck's situation is a thought provoker. It makes you envision what you would do in his place  and that life is not fair but you have to \\"breath everyday\\" and there is a bittersweet ending. There is a sweet message in the movie.<br /><br />Maybe not for everyone.<br /><br />Since Hanks is by himself a large part of the movie, there is not too much action sequence which might bore people.
B00005Q4GV|5.0|People might criticize George C. Scott for his total immersion into, and his passionate portrayal of the character of George Patton--sometimes at the expense of the other actors appearing in the same scenes. However, this great movie is about the man, General Patton; it is not about an event during World War II, like Pearl Harbor, D-Day, or the saving of Private Ryan. It would be only natural for Scott to dominate the film.<br /><br />Even so, there is something about this movie that does work on a grand scale. The battle sequences, although at times historically inaccurate, are absorbing and gripping nonetheless. Patton's strategies are beyond reproach. His unflinching courage, as dive bombers take aim at him, as gunners shoot at him, as a plane falls in flames just over his head, are cinematic testimony to this perfect general.<br /><br />Fortunately, the filmmakers also show us the man warts-and-all. He was a media manipulator. He also manipulated his own superiors when he sought fame and glory. He was totally self-absorbed and defiantly impatient.<br /><br />There are better World War II movies out there, undoubtedly. But any collection of WWII films that omits this movie is woefully incomplete. This is a great movie that deserves to be purchased.
B00003CXA2|5.0|What can I say? It's FORREST GUMP and TOM HANKS.<br /><br />Brief Overview<br /><br />Tom Hanks is amazing as a lovable dim witted guy who didn't have a chance to amount to anything (his back was as crooked as a question mark, five measely points below normal). But his good heart and simple understanding of things helps him live a life we all envy.<br /><br />Why We like the Story<br /><br />We root for him because of his good heart and the way he treats people and love that he unwittingly becomes a college football star, medal of honor soilder in the Army, shrimping boat millionaire, Macintosh stock holder etc. Gump is present at so many historical events that it keeps our interest and the fact that Gump witnesses all these events and has no clue about the significance of these events makes it amusing and endearing.<br /><br />Quotes<br /><br />There are so many great quotes from this movie \\"Life is like a box of chocolates\\" \\"Stupid is as stupid does\\" \\"But Leitentent Dan, you ain't got no legs\\" \\"Sorry I ruined your Black Panther Party\\" \\"I gotta pee\\" ..... etc. etc. they are endless.<br /><br />O yea and the classic \\"RUN FORREST, RUN\\".<br /><br />Tom Hanks's Acting<br /><br />The amazing scene where Gump finds  out that he has a child, lil Forrest and he gasps  \\"Is he....\\" and can't say the word smart because he knows what life the kid will have if he is slow like his dad, how people will treat him and how lonely and inadequte the child would feel. Its an amazing scene and you feel the humanity of Forrest Gump.<br /><br />He is an amazing actor. His performance here makes slow forrest a human to us. We don't spend the movie seeing him as a sad retarded guy. We see him as a person, who has something to overcome. He is lovable but a real character. Forrest is not reduced to a typical \\"retarded guy with not personality\\". Many \\"retarded\\" people are depicted in movies as simple, who laugh at simple things and have no depth. But Forrest is a real character with depth thatTom Hanks masters. Oscar is greatly deserved with this movie!<br /><br />THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR DVD COLLECTIONS OR PEOPLE YOU JUST BUY A FEW MOVIES. ITS THE MOVIES YOU THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE!!!
B00005AQF7|5.0|Dont say he wasnt, if u dont remember, i was young but i had this and the chronic before all eyez on me, and at the time this album sold out faster than any ALBUM IN THE 90'S. HE WAS THE MOST WANTED, and i bet he still would have, if he was 2 be behind Dr.dre's crafty & amazing beat's. Everybody, even THE ONE & ONLY, BIGGIE SMALLZ, wanted some of Dr.Dre, & Snoop Dogg. If your a true biggie fan, u would have noticed biggie sampled dre in things don change, in this album, on lodi dodi, snoop's singers where sayin \\"doggy doggy doggy, cant u see\\" and in biggies hypnotize, they did the same. 2Pac wanted 2 make a album with just them 2. and all because snoop dogg was the best rapper before biggie and 2pac died. his flow left u wanting more, his style was better than any MC, and nobody shined better behind Dre's beats. He and Dre put the west on the map, not nocking eazy e, a real motherf*ckin g, but dre an snoop had the East on their knee's. Gin & Juice, Who Am I, Doggy Dogg World, Tha ShiZnit, Murder Was The Case, Aint No Fun, Lodi Dodi, Even The G-Funk intro was the Sh*t. The whole album was crazy, overall, better than illmatic, ready 2 die, me against the world and the only way it would be better than life after death and all eyez on me, is if u combine it with the Chronic. those albums are more positive and lyrical, but this was more gangsta, more fly, and it can have people from every coast, East, West, 3rd Coast South, bumpin their head's. U KNOW ITS TRUE.
B0001I561E|5.0|One of the better Disney Classics... maybe the second most entertaining after the Lion King.<br /><br />This is the best plotlines that Disney has come up with (after the Lion King.<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />Aladdin is a poor street rat and the hero. He falls in love with Princess Jasmine. But evil Jafar is trying to become the sultan and the most powerful person in the world. Aladdin gets the geni and must try to get the girl, and defeat Jafar.<br /><br />Why it is Good<br /><br />Funny<br /><br />THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!!!!! Geni is Robin Williams. Iago is Gilford Gottfried. These two are sooooooo hilarious!!!! I'm an Adult and after years since I first watched it is still hilarious. My 2 year old neice also laughed her head off. I think that it is one of the funniest disney movies. The comedy is perfect!!!<br /><br />Plotline and Drama<br /><br />This is an amazing plotline. It doesn't slow down. There is no part where the movie drags or you start to feel like the drama is just going on. It moves at a awesome pace where you just keep watching. The story is great. Its original. NOT DULL.<br /><br />SONGS<br /><br />The music is not as great as the lion king. But it doesn't take away from the story or slow it down. I mean there are no musical numbers that the story line stops and the characters start singing. The music helps drives the plots and is funny to. The better songs is the classic \\"A Whole New World\\" and \\"Prince Ali\\".<br /><br />ENTERTAINING my verdict<br /><br />THIS IS THE TOP ECHELON OF DISNEY MOVIE. IT TRULY IS A CLASSIC. IT IS ENTERTAINING FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS CHILDREN. ITS FUNNY. THE PLOT DOES NOT DRAG ON AND GET DULL. MUSIC DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE. THIS IS AN AMAZING MOVIE!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!
B00000DFTG|3.0|I got this cd for the music only.  I had read the reviews about Ozzy using the F word with every breath and it's all true.  I could really do without that.  It's pointless. <br /> <br />The music is great.  You get an opportunity to hear all the classics with updated equipment and production.  Sounds great.  Much better than the Live Evil cd. <br /> <br />BUT, again, we have Ozzy being himself, which is a shame.  Why on earth couldn't it have been an Ian Gillan reunion???  Or Dio?   <br /> <br />If you want to hear some great new versions of your favorite classics then buy this cd.  If hearing Ozzy say the F word 15 times in between each song is going to bother you then you might want to just leave this one alone.
0525457585|5.0|I first watched this movie in 1990 and read the book in 1997. It didn't occur to me to write a review back then but since I'm at it now, here it goes. This book is a delightful read. Most people would choose to read the book first and then watch the movie but they often find that the film (1984) does not live up to their expectations. I loved the movie and also the book since the latter has more depth plus I had the benefit of visualization from having watched the first and second films before reading the book. The novel is full of imagination and details that are not fully explored in the films. It helps to fill in the blanks in certain areas and features more character development. You really get a feel of what it's like to be Bastian in the sense the author intended. For me, The Neverending Story will always be a classic for having been first exposed to it at an impressionable age.
B0002CHIJW|1.0|I watched this film hoping for a great revenge flick, in which the victim of a brutal rape enacts the revenge on her assailents like they deserve. Unfortunately what I saw was a film about a woman who gets raped, the details being the main focus of the movie, and a bit thrown in at the end about her  getting revenge by killing the guys. Only the bath tub guy gets what he deserves. The other guys all get relatively quick and painless deaths. They should be killed like the victims in \\"Saw\\", but they actually seem to get off pretty easily.  <br /> <br />The fact that the rape scene is around forty minutes long proves the misguidedness of the film makers. It's like using the movie \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" to say that murder is wrong. It just doesn't work to throw the subject in our face and force us to stare at it.  <br /> <br />I just feel like this movie screams to be remade, with the rape being downplayed, and the revenge being emphasized. It could have been done far better.
0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris has a lot to say about religious faith and how it can affect our behaviour. In particular, he looks at fundamentalist interpretations and the harm it causes. Harris also accuses religious moderates of not doing enough to curb such fundamentalism. Islam is taken as a prime example but its predecessor Christianity, is not left out either. I was shocked to learn of some of the things people have done in the name of their god. Harris argues that religion should be subject to the same burden of proof as anything else because it seems to be an unquestionable basis for actions that have far-reaching consequences for a lot of people. I agree with him. If we are going to let religion guide our actions in matters of the state, then let it be subject to critical analysis. If it does not hold up, then we must let reason triumph over faith. There is too much at stake in this complicated world. Harris also talks about 'spirituality' from a non-religious standpoint and how we can have fullfilment without reverting to religious dogmatism. Whilst that subject is still very new to science, he presents something of an alternative to those who believe, \\"there must be something more\\". The only problem I found with this book was the extensive footnotes. I'm sure Mr. Harris has a lot to say about many things but that much digression in one book can be tiresome.
B00005JOE8|1.0|This movie's horrible!  It spends it's two-and-a-half hour running time cramming left-wing political propaganda down your throat and expecting you to like it!  An entire hour goes by without ANYTHING HAPPENING!!!!!!  The characters are two-dimensional and boring!    Ultimately, V For Vendetta supports exactly what it condemns--chiefly, prejudice.  Christians and Conservatives are villainous charicatures in this one-sided \\"morality play,\\" whereas liberals can do no wrong (even if they're murdering people and blowing up buildings). That's interesting, given the film makers focus on social tolerance.  I guess if you disagree with their viewpoints, you don't matter.  And is blowing up buildings really the best way to make a point?  I don't think so.  I hope you don't.  Man, I want my money back.  And my two-and-a-half hours.  Don't see this.
B000301YY8|3.0|With a dial set well away from AM, middle-of-the-road frequencies, it was by chance that Blunt appeared on our radar. There he sat at the piano, one evening presenting the mood music for Michael Parkinson's chats with celebrities.Appearance on such a format should have served as an indicator of Blunt's talents. Still, his waif-like intensity was winning as he soared through the lament,'Goodbye My lover'. The promise of this pop-ballad does not extend to the remainder of the disc. His voice and sensibility, pitched near early 70s Barry Gibb and Elton John, is likely to net a similar audience. It's just that there is a wearying sameness to the songs, the vocal idiosyncracities and arrangments, that collectively dimish the compelling,'Goodbye'. The adolescent corniness of the lyrics suggests that, were I to pursue Blunt further, he'd need to solicit other writers or deepen the game with his muse. Given the mega success of this outing, neither course is likely.
B00005JOYA|3.0|Back in the late 90's we had been playing Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark for a while, and the horror fans of the world were already complaining that the game play had began to turn stale. We're always crying for innovation (especially in films, but I'll spare you that complaint.) Konami answered our cries for innovation by presenting us with a very different kind of horror in Silent Hill.<br /><br />  Most horror games relied heavily on zombies, and quick \\"Boo... Ahh!\\" scare to get it's job done. Silent Hill didn't do that very often, but what it did do was expose you to extremely disturbing images, and monsters that defy any conventional explanation. Are they Demons? Are they undead? Or more disturbing, Silent Hill 3's \\"They look like monsters to you?\\"<br /><br />  The best thing about Silent Hill was it's amazing story which revolved around a young woman named Alessa Gillespie who had extraordinary powers, powers, her mother Dahlia wanted to use to benefit the Cult of Samael. Everything that happened to Alessa was at the hands of her abusive mother, including being lit on fire. Dahlia even went so far as to misguide and trick Harry into working against Alessa who was trying to prevent the coming of Samael when Harry had to break a seal at a certain place and time where Alessa would be doing some sort of incantation, thus halting Alessa's progress... what I'm getting at is that it's true that in the Bad and Bad+ ending of Silent Hill Alessa was the end boss, however, and it is true that she was the root cause of the twisted world of Silent Hill. But, the witches, Dahlia, and the Order (AKA Cult of Samael) were indeed the bad guys, and in the ending I got Samael herself was the end boss. (I say her because of Silent Hill 3's revelations.)<br /><br />  Silent Hill the movie starts off similarly enough to the game that for the first hour or so a fan of the game will indeed be at the edge of their seat waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the scares to come. People who haven't played the game may enjoy the story, and the visuals, but aren't likely going to be getting scared by this film either. Non-fans will say that they never got the impression that Rose was ever in any real danger. The moment death was at hand the enemies (Whether they be skinless demon children who now have eyes and mouths making them less creepy) or the infamous Pyramid Head (Originally a delusion by James Sunderland in Silent Hill 2) just dissolve the moment Rose is about to be killed, thus eliminating any real feeling of danger.<br /><br />  Fans of the series can simply complain that Christophe Gans strayed too far from the original story. While he nailed most of the visuals dead on the plot doesn't seem Silent Hill like at all. For a while this film was code-named Centralia. I left this film wondering if the original story was going to be Centralia, but that Konami, who was seeking to do a Silent Hill film felt that the two were similar enough that they could both save some time and money by combining their efforts. This, if true, hurt the production. Silent Hill's original story could have saved this production, and or Centralia could have been saved by not limiting itself to the Silent Hill universe. If Gans wanted to do his own thing, he should have, instead I now have no way to present the original story that I love to my family members who don't play games, and I had talked this one up quite a bit.<br /><br />  The first half of the movie, as I stated, is not scary, but is pretty cool nonetheless. Pyramid Head doesn't do anything uber-disturbing like his video game counterpart, but he does cause a really awesome fatality to one of the unimportant characters. Later on when the towns folks start screaming \\" a witch! A witch!\\" I found myself feeling nostalgic for Monty Python rather than the original Silent Hill. These movie folks need to stop straying for the original material.<br /><br />  The story also starts out following the original plot closely enough but looses critical things like the hallucinogen that the Order was using, Dr. Huffman was nixed,  and although Nurse Garland makes a brief cameo her character is changed dramatically. As I stated earlier, the original plot didn't deal with Alessa being nearly killed by witch hunters, rather being subjected to abuse at the hands of the Order, and eventually suffering from being burnt alive by Dahlia, which is why in her room you see messages like \\"Mom... mom kill...\\" and \\"help me...\\" It's true that Alessa's soul was split up like in the movie, but Alessa lured Harry to Silent Hill to help her to defeat the cult of Samael, not for revenge against a bunch of witch hunters.<br /><br />  Perhaps the biggest complaint I have about Silent Hill the movie is the ending. I know that Silent Hill spreads. It chooses who it wants, and when it will let people go. It's possible that Rose and Sharon were simply not yet allowed to leave, but many people felt that the ending meant that they had died in the car crash, similar to one of the bad endings in the original game. If this is the case, however, I do wonder how on earth Gans will follow this film up, especially since Alessa is the lead in Silent Hill 3. That's right, you play as Alessa. The bigger problem is that since the 6th Sense too many writers and directors think that the \\"Oh and at the end they're revealed to be dead\\" ending is still unique. If indeed that is the case here then, no Christophe, this is not a unique ending. It's another \\"me too\\" 6th Sense rip off. If there's more too it than that then it simply was not clear enough for the uninitiated.<br /><br />  For Silent Hill fans it should be noted that although it nails most of the visuals dead on, the creepy feel of Silent Hill is lost, largely in part for Gan's silly \\"A Witch! A Witch!\\" replacement of the original story. Fans will likely feel, as I did, that the movie is very cool, especially visually, but will be disappointed that Gans strayed so far from the original plot, and that the monsters are under whelming, and even misused.<br /><br />  One such example is the demon nurse sequence. The demon nurses work well in the game. One or two at a time the way they move is extremely creepy, but in a large group like this it looked to me like they would break out into the Thriller dance routine. It was silly, not scary. And Pyramid Head should have had a lot more to do with in this film.<br /><br />  Non-fans will likely walk away with no clue what just happened or what made the game so great.<br /><br />  Books and game adaptations do have to undergo some changes to make them work on film, and I understand that. However, pretty much every video game to film adaptation except Mortal Kombat has been absolutely terrible because they stray too far from the source material. Hollywood does their own thing, and then slaps a well-known label on it.<br /><br />  But I have to ask, if the story from the game is good enough to make one want to do an adaptation, then why change the original premise? Silent Hill and Resident Evil have both nixed the original protagonists in favor of less interesting female leads. I felt more for Sean Bean's Christopher than I did for Rose. Rose was never in any real danger, Christopher was fighting loosing his entire family. That element of the film worked well on an emotional level. There is no good reason that Harry Mason needed to be replaced with a woman. None. Whatever excuses Gans throws out there the only reason this was done is because recent horror films have this idea that women should be the lead protagonists in all horror films, likely because they scream better than men. Fans of Lord of the Rings would have screamed bloody murder for this had Frodo been made a woman. I have nothing against women in lead roles. In fact, in original stories like the Ring or the Grudge I encourage it. But if the lead in the original story the film is based on is a weakly thirty-something male writer who is a widower with a sickly 7 year old girl it aught to stay that way. It is not okay to change the lead protagonist when adapting a book, the same reverence for source material that Hollywood has for novels needs to be extended toward video games as well.<br /><br />  Simply put this movie would have been infinitely better had it stayed true to the original story, but like Resident Evil before it, it falls apart when it begins to stray. That said, unlike Resident Evil, this movie is still pretty cool based on its visual merits.<br /><br />  With that said this movie is not un-enjoyable, and is the best video game adaptation since Mortal Kombat. Just don't expect anything super special, let alone scary.and that the monsters are under whelming, and even misused. <br />    One such example is the demon nurse sequence.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I am sure this film, the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven, will gain a growing reputation over the years, and become another Blade Runner, another Scott epic that initially bombed, but later became a cult item, and then a recognized masterpiece. Shame on studio executives for screwing around with cinematic artists. But, hey, it's the rule of the almighty buck.
140004281X|5.0|This collection of stories, some which are actually related, are simply wonderful reading, excelletn rpose, artful, funny, mysterious and truly drawing the reader in.  Anyone will find this collection good.  The characters are truly coming alive, and the writing makes one unable to put down each story and yet yearn for more when theyu are finished. Highly recommended as a gift for anyone.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman
B00004YA66|5.0|Without going into any details about this wonderful movie let me say this is one of the most enchanting, well-written, captivating films I have seen for all time.  It is a well-developed synergy of drama, suspense and thriller.  It is true this film has some science fiction but it is extremely well done and serves to provide the necessary elements to support the rest of the film.  This is by no means a second-rate sci-fi film nor would I classify it as a science fiction film.  In terms of its suspense, let's just say Frequency demands you pay attention just to stay along for the ride.  That's not to say you feel as though you are working to stay involved.  On the contrary, there are moments you forget about your own surroundings and feel you are in NY watching those Amazing Mets.  And be prepared to be observant and attentive.  Those who do will only enjoy the movie even more since it is laced with small nuggets that make you have those ah-ha moments when you happen to weave two or more related events together.  The acting is first cut also.  All to many movies either have one or the other.  But Frequency holds it all together from start to finish.  This is a movie you can watch (and watch again) with your friends and family (not youngsters though) and have something to talk about for days.  So in conclusion Frequency provokes both the mind and the heart.  It truly is a movie that moves one along several dimensions.  There are only a handful of movies I have seen that I would rate 5 stars and this is definitely one of them.

How about this for a review, \\"If you ever considered that rock and roll might be the type of music for you, you might enjoy this album. Amazon has other exciting titles to choose from as well. some of these include, The President's Army band Plays The National Anthem, or Time Warner Presents the Happy Birthday melodies.\\" Good enough? if not there are a million other english speaking people in the world who would be more than happy to explain abbey road to you. PS this is indeed a great album
B0009A40ES|5.0|This movie from start to finish depicts the life of a Wall Street business man to a psychotic yet elegant killer.Prefering to dine his victims or just simply murdering them in gruesome ways. His girlfriend a pretty annoying girl and friends who only intimidate him, like having better crafted business cards. The acting is astounding, Christian Bale is able to obtain the image of a business man with manners and raving psycho(though the business man is better played.)It's not so much thrill as its is horror, but nonetheless this is one of the best serial killer movies.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is how art is supposed to work. The artist puts art into the community. The community reacts to this art, and the artist responds. This response is now where evolution is supposed to happen. The Postal Service is Ben Gibbard's (guitar/voice...) evolution. Along with Jenny Lewis, Jen Clark(?), and the Programmer From Dntell, this album spans genres from indie-shoe gazer-sap-pop to electro-synth-hop. Finally, something unique has come out of the indie-hipster community. And it's dancable. Also you should take note that it is over three years old. So, if you don't have it, where you been? If nothing else, this album is fun and sounds neat. So I say Way to GO Ben.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The ultimate beatles documentary.  If any artist deserves a documentary of this size, it is the Beatles.  This series is a must-see for any serious Beatles or rock fan.  For those who have read the books and magazine interviews, much of the information will be familiar, but for the rare concert footage alone, these DVD's are worth the cost.
B000AADYRQ|1.0|I will begin this by stating that I know Ben Gibbard (vocals/guitar...) is very talented. We all heard that in the mail album he put out three years ago with some friends of his. Also if any of you were paying attention when photo album or something about airplanes came out you would have noticed that this band(death cab for cutie) is decent.But then of course Transatlanticism came out. The sub par pop-jangle mixed with lyrics straight out of an eighth grade goth girl's poetry journal made me think that every band has a slump and so it is time for theirs. And now this. Plans. Unless you are in high school and just aren't old enough to have heard the aforementioned death cab for cutie albums, than you have no excuse thinking that this album is great. Between the un-inspired guitar noodling and the worn out indie-hipster-\\"I am trying desperately to simuletaneously recapture my undergrad dorm days and finish my masters thesis\\"-to old to wear bluejeans to young to let my malepattern baldness get me down-whine session, this album takes a back seat to even red sanford's wash your a** record. And for the record, this review is not about selling out.If it was about selling out I wouldn't have rated the postal service at 5 stars. This is about all of you fans who seem to think that every album ever made should sound exactly like every other album ever made. This \\"I prefer light beer and kraft cheese to the real thing,\\" mentality of music listening is ruining the industry. Music is not supposed to be as boring as these last two death cab for cutie albums. Chris Walla (guitar/producer...)is a studio genius, but If you think he was alone in that production booth without some sappy atlantic producer pushing him to turn up the suck knob then you all need to listen to the long winters first two albums.That is part of what makes death cab for cutie's early work tolerable; the fact that both the song writing and production were rather unique. But Watered down indie-pop is not the new way to go, it is not the way of the future. Take a chance. Listen to something you have never heard of before. It might make your life more interesting.It might even introduce you to local bands that are unique and interesting. It might get you out of your cubicle and into a club where you can interact with living breathing humans. this in turn might get you new friends that are real and not profiles on some blog somewhere. But of course if you want to slip through life listening to the same thing over and over again, I have some old Minudo albums to reccomend to you.
0767817478|4.0|This big budget big screen version of Japan's most famous lizard is a very Americanized version of the \\"Godzilla\\" story. The monster looks a lot like those that appeared in Steven Spielberg's famous dinosaur trilogy, and the assembled cast -- incluiding Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, Hank Azaria and Kevin Dunn -- are neither sympathetic to nor seeking to destroy this monster.<br /><br />This neutrality is what I found most entertaining in the movie. While all those monsters on Spielberg's island got to run around and eat people with little or no accountability, here the big guy finds his way across the ocean to the Big Apple and is clearly held accountable for his actions. When he meets his doom he leaves something behind that signals one or more sequels could be forthcoming.<br /><br />I thought every moment of this special effects-driven adventure was exciting, involving and entertaining. The story was pure hokum -- right out of the legend of Japan's original monster -- but the views you get of the big guy and the destruction he delivers are always clearly detailed. There's never any monster lurking in the dark, so you can't see who's the star.<br /><br />The acting, as if you can call it that in a movie like this, is OK. In particular, Azaria plays a photographer that takes the first picture of Godzilla in New York, which is, of course, the biggest story in creation when he arrives.<br /><br />Broderick delivers a performance that bespeaks the neutrality with which everyone confronts the dinosaur. Neither is he driven to destroy the creature, as if Godzilla were Osama bin Laden incarnate, nor does he do anything idiotic to protect it even though its appearance represents a new species on earth.<br /><br />I think this is a big screen film that delivers a lot of excitement on a topic you've seen countless times. It is clearly worth a night's rental and maybe worth purchasing. It is definitely a lot better than most films like this that are produced this century.produced this century.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is the greatest series I have seen so far! Every episode is an incredible rush of feelings. Definitely worth your money. <br /> <br />Can anyone tell me if the DVD set includes spanish subtitles? Because a review in other website said: \\"Disney presents Grey's Anatomy in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. Colors are vibrant and fairly crisp, with good saturation and detail. A few images appear a bit soft, but there are no other flaws. Optional subtitles include English and Spanish.\\" I just want to be sure. <br /> <br />
0783116934|5.0|Of all the movies I've seen \\"set\\" in the former Soviet Union, this one manages best to show the reality.  Stephen Rea, as Viktor Burakov, has what would be an interesting job as a forensic pathologist - except that he is hampered in what he can do or say by Soviet dogma and bureaucracy.  When he learns that a serial killer is targeting kids and other vulnerables, luring them out of the city to rape and murder them, he is outraged (and frightened for his own children's safety).  He is also determined to catch this man.  Unfortunately, all of his superiors deny the possibility of communism ever producing such a deviant and refuse to give him even the smallest tools to help catch him.  Many, many years pass, and Burakov diligently pursues murder after murder, forced by his superiors to take precious time out from true investigation to shake down other Soviet targets such as homosexuals (deemed dangerous by the Soviets).  Finally, when communism collapses, he is allowed by his superior, Fetisov, the one man who has been sympathetic to his mission, to use modern tools such as computers and assigned adequate manpower to stage a hunt for this horrible killer who has been piling up the bodies for over twenty years.<br /><br />All the leads here, Rea, Sutherland, and DeMunn, are very convincing, even if their Russian accents are not quite right.  Also authentically Soviet are the buildings, streets, and extras.  Since Burakov's real enemy here is the stagnation and apathy of communism, it would be inappropriate if the buildings he worked in, lived in, or searched were clean and tidy and well taken care of.  Fortunately, they accurately reflect what is going on during the death throes of an unworkable ideology - this was a bleak place to exist.<br /><br />DeMunn portrays Chikitilo as gray and passive/aggressive.  He is eminently overlookable which explains why, when caught the first time, he is released.  It also explains how he lured all of these kids to their deaths without anyone taking notice of him.  And while he is clearly a monster, there are scenes in which DeMunn manages to inject humanity and pathos making him seem pathetic in addition to being evil.<br /><br />Burakov's relentless pursuit of this killer despite the odds and what it cost him personally and emotionally are what make the final moments of the movie so touching.  This movie is difficult to watch as it does not shy away from the violence being committed (though what is shown is not gratuitous), but ultimately, it's the saga of one man's determination to do what is right and outwait an apathetic regime.  Very satisfying.hout anyone taking notice of him.

0743454537|5.0|This book is about a girl named Anna and her sister.  Anna was specially designed to match her sister Sara's blood.  Sara has cancer was not even expected to make it past a year, but with the help of her sister, Sara is now sixteen.  Sara now needs a kidney though and Anna decides that she has had enough and does not want to give up her kidney after all.  The problem was though that her mother will not listen no matter what she says; so Anna decides to take matter into her own hands and goes out and gets a lawyer by the name of Campbell.  Even though Anna is going to court will she win and if she loses does she have to up a kidney still? If she wins, how will her mother take the news?  Will she get what she wants or will she give in to her mother's pressure?  Will Anna save her sister again, or will she let her die?  These are the questions you get to find out as you read this amazing story. <br /> What I liked about this book is that Jodi Picoult doesn't give just the view of Anna and Sara but she goes on to show how it affects the whole family.  I like how she explained the cancer words that she used throughout the book.  I also thought that the book was really well written. <br /> I don't think that there was anything that I didn't really like about this book and that it is a really well book overall.  Sad but a very good book.   <br /> I would recommend this book to anybody that enjoys a good story, but a sad one at times too.  I would not recommend this to anybody who is younger then Jr. High because it is a longer book and just overall not written really for younger children to read; otherwise you should read it. <br />
B00005JOYA|3.0|I bought one of the Silent Hill games for my brother after he said it was one of the creepiest games on the market. A few months later, I asked him what he thought of it. \\"Boring,\\" he said. \\"It takes forever for something to happen.\\"<br /><br />What really made me want to watch the movie was the insane, over-the-top, hell-on-earth imagery that I saw in the previews. Oddly enough, I didn't see the same preview twice. It seems like either the audience was different each time (my Tivo tapes everything from cartoons to sci-fi shows to comedies), or that the studio felt it was giving too much away. Since I hadn't played the games, I didn't know what to expect.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a bang as Rose (the attractive Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (the stalwart Sean Bean) Da Silva trying to rescue their daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) from certain doom. It seems the girl sleepwalks, with vivid nightmares of a place called Silent Hill. The two parents have a fundamental difference of opinion as to how to handle Sharon's somnambulism: Christopher wants to get her drug treatment, while Rose decides she needs to visit the town to face her fears.<br /><br />You see, Sharon was adopted. And it just so happens that she came from Silent Hill.<br /><br />Silent Hill, as it turns out, is not a place anyone actually visits. Some time in the 70s, a terrible fire lit the local coalmines beneath the town on fire, and it continues to burn to this day. So it's completely off limits, with the added benefit of being a really creepy place to boot; soot and ashes float around in the air, creating a perpetual twilight.<br /><br />Against Christopher's wishes, Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill. Along the way, a pretty lady cop (Cybil Benett, played by the tasty Laurie Holden) gets suspicious and gives chase. It's hard not to notice that female patrol officers in Silent Hill wear tight-fitting leather chaps and shirts. But I digress.<br /><br />The chase ends with Sharon missing. Rose and Cybil are now in another dimension, the alternate realm known as Silent Hill. Now the movie really gets started.<br /><br />Silent Hill reminded me a lot of Dante's Inferno. It's more a tour of the place than an actual story, and the movie plays out the same way. Silent Hill is a combination of purgatory and hell, vacillating between the two realms at random. Every time darkness falls, a fire siren rings out and birds fly for the nearest church, heralding the arrival of hell. And what a hell it is.<br /><br />Silent Hill has to be one of the most messed-up visualizations of hell ever put on screen. It's like that brief glimpse of hell envisaged in Constantine, only they made a whole movie out of it. Throughout, we can never forget that this town suffered a horrible, burning fate. Twisted, melted children clutch and crawl, wail and whine. Nurses with warped heads sigh and screech, striking with jittery, film-stop motions. An evil janitor has been turned into a twisted S&M mockery, summoning demonic swarms of roaches with human faces. Then there's the big pyramid-headed demon, who drags a massive blade behind him.<br /><br />This is really good material for a video game. But after a certain point, the protagonists have to actually do something. Cybil shows promise: she's a cop and she knows how to use a gun. She manages to shoot several creatures in the head, and even beats up five men at once. Unfortunately, she disappears for half the movie.<br /><br />Rose, on the other hand, is an irrational, screaming wreck. While one might make the case that you would be the same way after what Rose witnessed, after awhile her purpose in the story seems to mostly just survive by not doing anything particularly clever. It starts to feel like the scriptwriters are protecting Rose for some greater purpose, failing to convey any sense of danger.<br /><br />Bean's character has no relevance to the film whatsoever. He goes through an investigation of what happened at Silent Hill, but fails to unearth any new information; everything he learns is revealed to Rose as well. IMDB indicates that Bean's character was fleshed out because there were \\"no men in the movie.\\" So filler was added to balance the gender equation, and it shows. Does anyone really care that there weren't enough men in a movie? This isn't a romance!<br /><br />The characters don't have much opportunity for plot development. At one point, after witnessing burning babies and phlegm-spitting zombies, someone says, \\"something terrible happened here.\\" I laughed out loud. My guess is the scenes were edited out of order. Yes, ladies, when zombies are clawing at you and a town is covered in perpetual soot, you can bet your bottom dollar that \\"something terrible happened\\" there.<br /><br />The other problem is that Silent Hill doesn't really want to offend anybody. Although there's plenty of gore and vague Christian imagery, the tragedy that created Silent Hill is directly tied to the dangers of religious fundamentalism. Instead of making a comment about modern day religious zeal by portraying the group as a believable cult, it comes off as badly transplanted witch-hunter dialogue. It's hard to believe the cult existed in a modern 70s town. Instead of making the cult members pathetically misguided, they come off as cartoonish.<br /><br />Despite its plot flaws, Silent Hill is a visceral experience. The monster effects are superb, using a combination of CGI and latex makeup that rarely looks fake. The contrast between the light of limbo and the darkness of hell is chilling. And then there's the use of sound; at various points, the movie becomes completely silent. Never has silence been so terrifying.<br /><br />The end is somewhat predictable and contrived, leaving it open to a sequel. And really, Silent Hill isn't that bad of a horror movie. It resorts to the slow terror of awfulness; not the oogity-boogity shrieking attacks common to what passes for horror these days. In that respect Silent Hill is an achievement: a horror film that is content to horrify. It's Hellraiser for the gamer set, and that's not such a bad thing.<br /><br />Now if they could only find something for Sean Bean to do...t happened at Silent Hill, but fails to unearth any new information; everything he learns is revealed to Rose as well.

B00005JOYA|4.0|I've never played the Silent Hill video games, so I can't say anything from that point of view.  But as a horror fan, I was extremely surprised by how good this movie was! <br /> <br />The visuals were great, not relying on CGI overmuch.  I felt that the inclusion of the \\"male\\" scenes were actually good because they added visual contrast - so you have parts of the movie that are in the Silent Hill \\"grey\\", the dark nightmare scenes, and some with the normal real-world chroma.  It adds to the visuals to have a regular point of comparison; if the entire movie was grey you'd become more accustomed to it, and if too much of the movie was shot in \\"Nine Inch Nails-vision\\", as some are, it would be overwhelming. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the plot - not sure where the criticisms of not having a plot come from; the protagonist is trying to find her lost daughter, but is unwittingly being led from place to place by the evil spirit of Silent Hill in an attempt to convince her to achieve its own ends.  (That's about 10 words longer than the plot description of most horror movies).  The characters were realistic and didn't fall into the horror movie cliches of either turning Ash-in-Army-of-Darkness style monster killing machines or into passivity; they were bold but imperfect.  There was resolution but ambiguity...  I found the ending a little interesting in that usually the \\"but it keeps going!\\" endings are usually not found in the \\"moral culpability\\" horror genre unless the protagonist gives in to evil somehow; you can read the ending in this way but I'm not sure Rose did anything any parent wouldn't...  The overall point of the movie was a human one, similar to the original Romero zombie movies - that the intolerance and hatred of an innocent, and stigmatizing her as \\"evil\\", eventually caused the innocent to become evil.   <br /> <br />There were flaws - there was a bit too much explanation in the \\"Architect\\" scene; I felt unrewarded for having figured that all out already.I felt the CGI-heavy scenes were weakest (the bugs, the barbed wire).  But nothing that a couple more minutes edited out wouldn't fix.  I wouldn't make the movie shorter just to make it shorter - unlike, apparently, the MTV-crazed twitch jockeys going to movies nowadays, I don't object to getting two full hours of entertainment for my $10.   <br /> <br />So, in closing, I felt like Silent Hill was a standout in the current crop of modern horror movies, which are pretty much just either remakes of older movies or torture porn.  It's definitely the best movie based on a video game ever - I have a guilty fondness for Mortal Kombat, but must admit its cheesiness.
0380789035|4.0|Chosen by my book club and definitely not my usual preferred genre for reading, I must admit that I enjoyed this book. It was hard to put down. I won't go into details..too complicated; but, an eye-opening look at our culture (past and present) and what we revere and believe in and how we will go to great lengths to preserve our beliefs no matter how pure or corrupt they may be.<br /><br />The book, itself, was an easy and fast read (for over 500 pages). I knew that the story was meant to be suspenseful and was slowly leading up to something big, but I was disappointed that the author took so much time to get there and so little time at the end to divulge the secrets and tie things up. I do admit that there were a couple of surprising things I did not see coming. Lots of metaphorical dialogue, brief and limiting conversations between characters and frequent jumps to the past left me confused at first, but keep reading and it all falls into place by itself (the graphic sex scene near the beginning caught me off-guard and was quite risque, but gets explained later; other than foul language and a few less graphic sexual scenes, this is a one-time event).<br /><br />Give it a try - you will enjoy it.
B00006DEFA|5.0|The original Amadeus is my FAVORITE movie ever! I absolutley LOVE it and watch it repetitively; I can quote dialogue from memory and have favorite quotes that I use regularly. I think you understand how I feel about this movie! By the way, my whole family (kids included) echo my sentiments.  <br />I chose to check out the Director's Cut and read its corresponding reviews to see if I could get anymore of this wonderful film. I would love to see the interviews, etc., but am fearful that adding deleted scenes to the movie itself will somehow ruin the whole thing and take away from my passion for it. I would like to thank those reviewers who have added commentary on what these deleted scenes actually include - you have filled in a few gaps for me and answered a few questions, but have also helped me to decide to stick with the original version. I can fill in the blanks in my head now, but still enjoy the movie in all its original glory and award-winning version (and sounds like my kids can still enjoy it, too).  <br />Watch this movie - you will love it! <br />
B0001M0A4I|4.0|Keyboardist Tony Banks always tried to keep some elements of classical/progressive in the music of Genesis, even as his bandmates Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford led him further down the pop path. It's really pleasing that he finally let his classical training have full rein  on \\"Seven\\". <br /> <br />I don't pretend to be an expert on the history or structure of classical music. However, I think Tony did an excellent job in producing interesting orchestral work here. As the liner notes describe, the pieces provide a lot of variety and contrast. My favorites are \\"The Ram\\", the most dynamic and forceful piece, (perhaps most distantly related to his rock work) and the gentler \\"Earth Light\\" at the other end of the spectrum. Still, the whole CD is really nice from start to finish and is hardly boring or bland.  <br /> <br />The only drawback is that you don't get to hear much piano from Tony, this being a suite for the orchestra. Maybe next time, he'll be able to write a piano concerto or solo pieces for piano in the same mold. Until then, \\"Seven\\" is a good debut for Tony as a classical composer, the best thing to come out of the breakup of Genesis.
B000BVD460|5.0|Ever since Eminem was discovered by Dr. Dre in 1999, Eminem has exemplified the rap artists that step ahead of the curve. <br />The most common thing discussed in rap songs are girls, drugs, and sex; Eminem's lyrics most oftenly consist of much more than this, making him quite honestly the best lyricist ever. <br /> <br />This album is very good composition of his work. Such classics as \\"Lose Yourself\\", \\"Stan\\", and \\"Sing for the Moment\\" have the listener remember just how utterly fantastic his work is. <br />Contrasting that, as any greatest hit collection with often make people discuss, there are certainly some songs missed (great tracks that were overlooked as being 'hits'). <br /> <br />Something I always enjoy other reviewers doing... I'll rate each song 1-10 in the same order as the track list on the CD. <br /> <br />1. Intro... N/A (see the title of the song) <br />2. Fack... 3/10 (one of the weakest on the CD, and a new song not found on any of Eminem's previous four albums; the beat is good, but the lyrics and the effects are kind of ridiculous in my opinion; still something to laugh at though I suppose; overall something that doesnt deserve to be here) <br />3. The Way I Am... 9/10 (fantastic song, really powerful lyrics, strong beat and chorus and verses, decent beat, Eminem doing what he does best; overall a strong song to follow an interesting intro) <br />4. My Name is... 6/10 (compared to his work now its not really up to par, but of course it brings nostalgia to everyone who remembers the song in middle school; as everyone knows the lyrics are decent as is the beat; however objectively its not nearly as strong as some other tracks) <br />5. Stan... 10/10 (amazing song, the lyrics are memorable beyond all others, the beat is very powerful, the chorus by Dido is amazing and serene contrasting the strength of the verses; really just a song above all others by any rap artist) <br />6. Lose Yourself... 10/10 (another amazing song, the beat is one of the best Eminem has ever composed, the lyrics are also memorable in their greatness, the chorus is really awesome as well, something anyone who listens to music has and will enjoy after hearing it; right next to Stan tracks 5 and 6 are Eminem's best) <br />7. Shake That... 8/10 (a really good contrast to the two previous tracks being a good song that aims for dancing and smiles rather than depth of thought, I myself love the verses and chrous done by Nate Dogg as he is a great hook singer; a fun song all around, unfortunately played out by the radio recently; but still good) <br />8. Sing for the Moment 10/10 (jeez, what an amazing song as well, the lyrics speak truly of Eminem's strength in this aspect of rapping-both controversal and honest, great beat, fanstastic chorus by Aerosmith's Dream On; overall in the top 5 of Eminem's best) <br />9. Without Me... 9/10 (like Shake That as a really fun song to listen and dance to-as well as being memorable from back in the day, beat is really good and the chrous is fun; overall a classic amongst great hip hop songs) <br />10. Like Toy Soldiers... 8/10 (really powerful song as well, Eminem doing what he does best again, strong lyrics, beat is ok, good chrous; overall a good fodder song amongst the CD) <br />11. The Real Slim Shady... 7/10 (furthering the serious/ridiculous pattern since track 6, fun song with a fun beat as well as semi-interesting lyrics, really good chorus; overall a classic from Eminem's arsenal, but not as superb as his stronger songs) <br />12. Mockingbird... 10/10 (again-like so many before it thus far-an amazing song with really really great lyrics, a great beat, and a chrous that is amazingly memorable, I always lick how the soft beat and chorus complement the strength of the words spoken and sung; overall one of my personal favorites) <br />13. Guilty Conscience... 5/10 (although I like Dr. Dre a lot for everything he's done-this song is kind of weak, the beat is decent, the lyrics are rather lackluster,and the alternating verses are kind of weak; overall: eh) <br />14. Cleanin' out my Closet... 7/10 (I personally never considered this song one of Eminem's best-but still decent in a good beat and of course very good lyrics and an ok chorus, I'd pick other Eminem Show tracks over this one at this point, however still ok as it is a song very much recognized by the masses; overall ok) <br />15. Just Lose It... 9/10 (another comical song, but still fun to listen to as it pokes fun at a lot, the beat is really fun, and the lyrics and chorus are really tight to just laugh to; overall with Without Me as the best of Eminem's more fun songs) <br />16. When I'm Gone... 10/10 (completing the real CD-excluding the bonus- and its rotate of fun and powerful songs, a really amazing song, again the lyrics prove Eminem is the best, strong chorus and a really tranquil beat just like the others; overall one of the best, a strong (real) conclusion to the CD) <br />17. Stan... 4/10 (don't get me wrong-I really like this song in its originality- however this take, albeit with another artist equally recognized as great, the piano beat is decent but not quite as good; my biggest upsetting feature is the Elton John factor-I think Dido was so much better as the chorus singer, Elton John's singing seems like he wanted too much creativity with the small hook; overall I really wish this song wasnt here as Stan is amazing enough by itself, however I can't blame too much for this song being here because of its recognition after the 2001 Grammy's 'I think') <br /> <br />Thanks for reading
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon channels the spirits of Johnny and June Cash. If you don't believe me, watch this film and see<br /><br />This story is about a  young punkish Cash...the one with a drug problem, emotion problems and groweing up problem. He is the  rebel with a  musdical cause. Phoenix does not just play the younger Cash, he dominates the vocals as  well. You can debate if he should have won the Oscar.  I am sorry he didn't but it still is an amazing performance. If you like this, catch him in the  movie Buffallo Soldiers or Ladder 49.<br /><br />And now to the Lady Reese, she is June Carter Cash.  Like Sissy Specek, Ms Witherspoon transformed into June. Her Oscar winning performance was earned and not handed out lightly. Now she can do Legally Blonde three without worrying!<br /><br />X-Files's Robert Patrick is great as Cash's Father ray. He is a stand out in this emsemble cast<br /><br />Do I think this film is a classic? NO, far from it.<br /><br /> However this film is a great piece of  bio filmmaking in the cinema of reality with such films like Ray, Capote, Miracles, and the Great Escape<br /><br />Well worth getting, all the performances are so well done<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD
B000000WCV|3.0|So I got into Daft Punks discocery album last year a lot... well I got really into the songs on the album but I had no clue who Daft Punk was or that they had albums out. So I set out to buy their stuf and ended up buying all their albums and some singles like Around the world, Revolution 909 and Alive 1997. <br />  I loved all the albums I got, except this one. I mean I love Around the world and Da Funk, but the others are really not that great... I mean I guess they are good beats and stuff, but as songs I feel they fall short. Although I still give this album much credit for it is their first. And they are good beats... <br /> <br /> -Bassically if your looking to buy this album because you liked Discovery or Human AFter All, you might be dissapointed
0930289234|5.0|I will agree with some of Watchmen's amateur critics and say that it gave me a huge headache the first time I read it.  Guess what that headache comes from?  Thinking.  Thinking long and hard late into the night about the human condition.  Struggling to comprehend exactly what makes the characters tick, and why there has to be so much trash in their world and ours.  Trying to overcome some of my instinctive, visceral horror at some of the events as they unfold toward their shattering conclusion.<br /><br />Watchmen is a book for those who like to think about the things that all of us fear.  In fact, it FORCES its readers to think by plunging them headfirst into a plot that's unintelligible UNLESS one is actively thinking.  It completely destroys the typical image of innocent comics and simply superheroes.  Rorschach is not the Dark Knight; he's the mirror image of the darkest in all of us.  Dr. Manhattan isn't the American Superman; he's God, and he doesn't care about humanity.  Ozymandias isn't the world's golden boy, Laurie isn't Catwoman...I could go on forever.  The people of Watchmen and their actions are both us and not us.  They are us through a telescope and under a microscope.  Watchmen takes all the mundane horrors of daily life, mixes in a little salt and vinegar, and throws them in our wounds.<br /><br />Watchmen was for me and so many others a masterpiece, a challenging, fascinating, and horrifying experience.  But it's small wonder that a lot of people don't understand this book.  Lots of us choose to go around with iPod headphones in our ears and tape over our eyes.<br /><br />...just don't blame me when Rorschach comes to call.
B00005JOIH|4.0|The review is focused mainly on the technical aspect of the this 2-discs edition of \\"Munich\\" DVD. The four stars is for the film, The behind-the-scenes features are insightful enough, covering sevreal key element of the origin of the story, and the making of the movie. The package is an attractive slip case over a fold-out custom-made digipak (which is miles superior to the single-disc edition), inside there is a 38 pages color booklet consists of photos and praising quotes from critics. However, they still seem somehow lackluster for a hard-to-come-by, much higher-priced \\"Limited Edition\\".    Most of all, I am very disappointed to see that this so called \\"Limited Edition\\" has broken the tradition of a string of Speilberg's films by not including the DTS track. In fact, this has been a concern for me with the recent Universal/Dreamworks catalogue. This is someone who back in 2000, set a benchmark for all DVD release with the 2-disc version of \\"Gladiator\\") A few years back, Universal/Dreamworks DVD never failed to tag on a far superior DTS soundtrack on almost all their DVDs (\\"Bourne Identity\\", \\"Shrek\\", \\"Spy Game\\", \\"Shindler's List\\", \\"Minority Report\\"... to name a few, even to the very recent \\"The Terminal\\" and \\"War of the Worlds\\"), or at least available as an alternative version of DVD in some earlier cases (\\"Road to Perdition\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", albeit at the expense of losing some extra features). Given that Mr. Speilberg himself was the advocate in DTS technology since 1993 as well as the front of Dreamworks studio, this was no surprise, and very much to the writer's delight. I never had a problem with Spielberg not giving a commentary track, because I could always relied on him to present a quality product (DVD, that is)    But this beloved feature have been unjustly missing in several DVDs that are screaming for its inclusion (\\"Bourne Supremacy\\", \\"Serenity\\", \\"King Kong\\" or even \\"Shrek 2\\" jump to mind). Those readers tasted the high clarityand pulse raising resonance of DTS would understand. Those who haven't, I sincerely urge you to find time to visit a reputable electronic store and ask for a demo. Now I realize there is limited storage capacity on one dual-layer DVD, especially if a higher video transfer rate is in order. But surely, is a French 5.1 necessary? (Sorry, folks who perfer to listen to dubbed French soundtrack. If we were encouraged to watch French films in their original language - and most of us do - I am sure it won't hurt you to try). I admit once in a while it is rather amusing to watch Indiana Jones shouting heroic banters in out-of-sync French, but for the subject matter of \\"Munich\\", I doubt that anyone would care to try. Besides, the extended version DVDs of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, each managed to fit in half of its film length (which is, allow me to remind you, pushing two hours), three different soundtracks (Dolby 2.0, Dolby 5.1 EX, and DTS ES 6.1) as well as four full length commentaries, while still keep a stellar visual quality. I am having a hard time believing Universal do not have the technology to compete with that. What puzzles me is that, while home theater equipments are becoming increasingly popular, and most of them are built with DTS compatibility, yet we will not have the option to have the softwares to experience it? We are gradually marching into the era of HD-DVD (or Blueray), yet the studios still expect us to settle with anything less than our home theaters' full potential. I can't help but to feel patronized.    (The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack is actually a Descriptive Voice Service - a narration of the screen for the visual impaired)    I probably won't be surprised to see if there will be an \\"Ultimate Commemorative Edition\\" not too far down the line (Or even possibly, a HD DVD release that includes everything we get in this package) Frustrating indeed. I only hope Universal will come to grasp on what really makes a \\"Limited Edition\\" DVD special, understand what a lot of DVD collectors who wish to relive the cinematic experience at home are hoping for. At least, offer an alternative version, so those who long for such feature will have the option.

0684803356|5.0|This rich novel explores many fundamental human themes including love, duty, perseverance, and sacrifice.  Like all great literary works, it transcends the era in which it was written and speaks to readers for generations after the author has passed away.  This is a great novel by a great writer, and I can't understand how anyone would rate this less than five stars.  The novel spans only a few days, and contains the story of Robert Jordan, a volunteer in Spain who is sent on mission to blow up a key bridge with a band of guerillas behind the Nationalist lines as part of a Republican offensive.  The novel is primarily a dialogue between Jordan and the members of the guerilla band.  The tension builds to the final confrontation at the bridge.  There are several extensive sidebars not directly relevant to the main plot, including the discussion of the fate of Pilar's village, and the last stand of El Sordo's guerilla band.  These are probably the best written, most detailed, sections of the novel.  Some would say that these distract from the main story, but I argue that they add richness and depth to the characters and to the events of the main plot.<br /><br />EH writes with a direct, readable prose.  His characters are complex and multi-dimensional, and often conflicted.  One may argue as to whether this is his best work or not, or whether he was a better writer of short stories or novels.  What does it matter?  This is one of the greatest war novels, indeed one of the greatest novels, ever written.  In terms of richness and depth, only Zola's La Debacle is comparable to this work.<br /><br />One thing in particular struck me about this story that make it an unconventional war novel.  Most war novels either take the philosophic position of patriotic glory for the homeland or war as a pointless exercise in destruction.  Robert Jordan has a unique perspective in this book in that he is an outsider fighting for a cause, not for a country or a government.  He isn't driven by patriotism, or love of country.  He isn't fighting for the national army of his homeland.  This gives him a unique perspective to question why he is fighting and what he is fighting for, particularly after he falls in love.tism, or love of country.  He isn't fighting for the national army of his homeland.  This gives him a unique perspective to question why he is fighting and what he is fighting for, particularly after he falls in love.
B00005KHJV|5.0|I only wish I could add John Carpenter's theme music to this review. Between the hackle-raising menace of that, and the looming presence of Michael Myers everywhere but in full view, Halloween has been stood firmly at the top of my all-time horror list for decades.<br /><br />It is ironic that this is the movie credited with setting the tone for the series of slasher flicks that followed. The success of Halloween lies in what it does not show, rather than what it does. The hulking figure of Myers is always at the corners of vision -- outside a window, or in the shadows across the street. We never see the knife blade plunge into flesh. Instead, Carpenter gives us just enough and forces a viewers imagination to do the rest.<br /><br />For the three or four people who have not yet seen this horror classic, I'll describe it briefly: A 6-year-old boy inexplicably stabs his older sister to death on Halloween night. For more than a dozen years, he waits in silence at an asylum, waiting for some unseen signal to set him in motion again. That happens on Halloween night in 1978, when a quite grown up Myers returns to his Haddonfield home to stalk the teenage girls who serve as mirrors of his long gone sister.<br /><br />You never see Myer's face, but for one small moment during the tense and terrifying final act. He is a silent killer who is there one moment and gone the next. Jamie Lee Curtis, in her film debut, quickly earns the scream queen title. Donald Pleasance is stellar as the harried, rattled psychiatrist who knows what evil is really stalking Haddonfield.<br /><br />\\"This isn't a man,\\" he tells the town sheriff in a gore crow voice.<br /><br />He's right. Myers is the original horrific killer who keeps getting up when he is supposed to be dead. Halloween is edge-of-your seat fright and it's a movie that should be watched every year when the big night rolls around. It's my favorite of them all. I cannot carve a pumpkin or watch costumed children roaming the streets without humming Carpenter's chilling music in my head. Best horror movie ever, best horror movie theme. I'll stake my bag of candy on it.s chilling music in my head. Best horror movie ever, best horror movie theme. I'll stake my bag of candy on it.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|If you'd refuse to buy a movie just because of the DVD cover art, then you must not have actually liked the movie.  I don't necessarily care for the \\"cover art\\" on a Domino's box, but that don't mean I'm never eating pizza again...  Secondly, the art is not complete.  Many DVD sites have reported that the cover will be a lenticular image, that morphs from Felicity Huffman, the actress, to Bree, her character.  Don't be so quick to judge a film by it's cover.  (And it's a great film, too.)
B000E6UK5K|3.0|I must say that this cd is what can be expected by a 60 year old man.  Hold on.... that is not necesarily a bad thing.  If you are expecting Pink Floyd you will be very disapointed, but if you want to hear 60 year old Gilmour you may be presently surprised. It is not Pink Floyd that is for sure, but then neither was Division Bell or Momentary Lapse of Reason, but that is another story.   There are some interesting moments.  Here is a track by track review: <br />Castellorizon: Great opening...  <br />On an Island: Decent song here, he still sounds very good. This sounds like a much younger Gilmour <br />The Blue: Nothing spectacular here, but it is okay <br />Take a Breath: Very Post Waters Floyd sounding, alittle 80's sounding in general. Great Gilmour solo in this song though. <br />Red Sky at Night: Average, but David plays the Sax! <br />This Heaven: Average again. <br />Then I close my eyes: Nice instrumental here, too short though. A nice looped guitar track that disolves into some nice playing by David. <br />Smile: This song is very Sir Paul Mcartney sounding, but it grows on me with each listen <br />A Pocketful of Stones: This song in my opinion is the worst song that any Floyd related prject has ever produced.  This is terrible and unimaginative swill. <br />Where we start: Good track, nice ending to an average album. <br />Pretty average and standard stuff on this album, it is not going to conjure images of Live at Pompeii or Syd Barrett that is for sure, gone are any experimental touches, but if you want to hear a nice album by a legendary guitarist you could certainly do much worse.  Personally I like it better than Momentary Lapse of Reason.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great quote from Joss describing firefly.  With alot of scifi coming out today many of which have failed, you see a future with wooden characters that quite frankly don't act human or deal with real human problems, which are complicated and can't always be expressed with words.  This show brought the characters to life and made us relate to each one.  This is masterful writing, this is Joss Whedon, and this is FIREFLY... <br />I miss this show!
B00005MP58|3.0|The admirable attempt of this film adaptation to remain true to the content and feel Jane Austin's enduring literary work cannot override the liability of lamentable casting. <br /> <br />Of the primary characterizations, only Ehle as Elizabeth stands out.  Firth is sadly wasted as Darcy (especially so because he SHOULD have made a perfect Darcy) since he spends most of his  film time standing or stalking about broodily, and delivers what lines he has in an affected, stilted manner which lends nothing to the character.  Both the main players seem unconsciously to be imitating Garson and Olivier in the older adaptation of the film (which despite flaws of costume and a condensed storyline is a thousand times more enjoyable than this effort and should not be missed).  Firth even wears a pinkie signet ring like Olivier, and twists it distractedly in his discourses with Elizabeth in uncanny imitation of Sir Laurence. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most ghastly casting error is Susahanna Harker as Jane.  While her acting skills are adequate, her appearance falls far short of the exceptional beauty required for the role; she puts one to mind of a blond, bug-eyed Mona Lisa, and unkind as it may seem this reviewer found it impossible to accept her in the role due primarily to her limited pulchritude.  In the same vein, the visage of Mary is also seems unnecessarily unattractive; in the first ballroom scene they either manufactured or left unconcealed a number of acne spots on the actress' face, which made me feel sorry for both the character and the actress.  <br /> <br />Also lamentable is the overacting done by Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet.  Her interpretation of the character is no more than an annoying stereotype.  One rolls their eyes when she appears on screen, and anxiously awaits her departure. <br /> <br />Bonham-Carter is likable and effective as Mr. Bingley.  Also effective is Benjamin Whitrow as the pleasant but generally inaccessible Mr. Bennet, Adrian Lukis as thetwo-faced Wickham, David Bamber as the obsequious Mr. Collins, and Lucy Scott as an underachieving Charlotte. <br /> <br />Beautiful countrysides, excellent efforts by supporting cast members and a consistently strong showing by Ms. Ehle, is in the end insufficient to incite enthusiasm for this adaptation.  (Curiously, the latest adaptation of Austin's work suffers an almost identical malady, except in THAT film it is Keira Knightly who is hopelessly under-utilized in the role of Elizabeth).
B000002BMV|5.0|Journey returned in 1981 with their second studio album of the decade, titled ESCAPE.  It's an excellent album, opening and closing with two strong arena ballads and filling the space in-between with high-powered hard-rock songs.  Steve Perry's long-winded vocals have never sounded better, especially mixed with Neil Schon's powerful guitar-playing, Jonathan Cain's strong/passionate keyboards and Steve Smith's sturdy drumming.  The album sports three billboard hits, \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\", \\"Open Arms\\", and \\"Who's Crying Now\\", but there's many other greats here as well, particularly \\"Stone in Love\\", \\"Lay It Down\\", and the emotional \\"Still They Ride\\".  The feeling of rebellious youth surrounds ESCAPE, and that feeling is just as strong after all these years.  This is an outstanding rock album, and in the eyes of many fans, Journey's greatest recording.
0393327655|4.0|The basic premise of the book is that institutionalized religion is no longer conducive to civilization. He makes the very reasoned argument that we are not, as a species, able to control our violent nature. This inborn need to kill those who disagree with us is exasperated by religion and, when combined with nuclear weapons, will eventually lead to the destruction of civilization, if not the species entirely. <br /> <br />Harris argues that codified beliefs are nearly guaranteed to incite violence. The basic premise is that if you believe, really believe, that the only way to please god is to obey the teachings of a specific holy text, then you will see violent actions to suppress other beliefs and strengthen your own as not just acceptable, but holy, just, and necessary.   <br /> <br />Harris can, at times, seem a bit caustic. I would recommend this book to people who won't be offended by someone who goes beyond just questioning the validity of religion. There are people I know that I would like to expose to some of the ideas expressed within the book yet I wouldn't recommend The End of Faith to them. This is, in some ways, a great shame. Harris had to state his positions in the way that he did, strongly and unapologetically, but he's written off a large portion of the audience that needs to see his work. A less divisive version would be more palatable and at the same time, less effective. <br /> <br />For people of faith, it would take a very dedicated reader to go through Harris' book and be able to sift out the useful truths without being insulted or at least so disgusted with the author's critical positions as to give up entirely. <br /> <br />For my complete review, go &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">here&lt;/a>.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Excellent album.Very unique touch to all the tracks.Somewhat reminded me of the killers when i first listened to it but they r very different.Ive listened to this album over and over and the lyrics never get tired and neither does the music
0743454537|5.0|In my opinion this is one incredible book. I have never read a book that portrayed so many emotions in so many ways. My Sister's Keeper really affected me in a positive way.  <br /> <br />It is about a family who is struggling with medical help. Kate the middle child was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of two. Kate now 16 often gets transplants from her donor/ sister Anna. Anna was genetically selected to be Kate's perfect match. Ever since Anna was a baby she has had to undergo many surgeries to help Kate. At one point Anna becomes tired of not having any say in her health, so she takes matters in to legal matters. Not only is this story about the health of two teen girls, it also has to do being able to make the right choice. This is a very controversial topic, although this is one of the things that makes it so good.  <br /> <br />I also really enjoyed how the novel switched narratives throughout it. This way you were able to here all sides of the story, all the family members, Anna's lawyer, and her legal guardian ad. The ending of this book is surprising and very upsetting. I cried so hard. Yet, there would not have been any other way to end it. I highly recommend this book. It has changed my views on many topics. <br />
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|A compelling tale of power, money and depravity which sets the dark mood for the earthy tone in this truly riveting action-thriller.  <br /> <br />Casino has often been compared to Goodfellas and indeed one of the few variations is that the film is set in the heart of swinging Las Vegas in the 1970's. Casino certainly holds enough merits of its own and certainly being a unique and highly origanal film within itself, deserves to be judged on such merits.  <br /> <br />The oscar-winning actor, Robert De Niro, one of Americas finest actors, heads the superb cast list. De Niro plays Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, a master bookie turned big shot casino manager, whose astute head for business, quickly deserts him when he marries ex-hooker, Ginger Mckenzie, which is played masterfully by the sultry Sharon Stone who displays a beleavably raw edge to her characterisation and plays out her scenes with conviction and gritty realism.  <br /> <br />Sams boyhood aquaitance, Nicky Santon (another superb turn from Joe Pesci, in another darkly vengeful role) turns up with a highly ambitious agenda of his own plans and this merley proceeds to take things on an even further downward spiral.  <br /> <br />Casino was shrewdly written by Nicholas Pileggis (who had enjoyed previous success with the cult classic, Goodfellas) and cunningly goes in for absorbing realism, expertly drawn characters that are played with instinctive conviction by the highly acclaimed array of stars and a whole host of intriguing subplots that leads to the dramatic, violent climax.  <br /> <br />There are plenty of stomach-churning scenes of brutal violence with such graphic images of a victims head being rapidly squeezed in a vice which is defintely one of the most violent acts that takes place in the film. Also the ending is a bit of a shocker where Joe Pesci and his brother are both beaten to death by a vengeful gang, and then are carelessly buried alive. Uncomfortable viewing on those particular scenes.  <br /> <br />On the whole though, Casinos well thought out and carefully prepared structure is accompanied by an enthralling and sizzling soundtrack that helps capture the mood and ambience of its era, effectivly. A genuine masterpiece. <br /> <br />
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is definately an album you have to listen to a few times.  It can not be compared to Ok or Bends because it is a departure from that type of music completely.  But where this album goes is just as good.  2+2=5, Where I End, There There, Punch Up, Wolf at the Door are all some of my favorite Radiohead tracks and trust me I have listened to alot of Radiohead.  So give this a try but don't expect Karma Police or High and Dry and remember that change keeps music from getting old.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder (born Steveland Judkins Morris) began singing in a choir with his mother and siblings at a very early age at the Whitestone Baptist Church, which lay in his hometown of Saginaw.  <br /> <br />By the age of 10, Stevie Wonder was a child prodigy. He proved a master on the piano, harmonica and drums and was adept at poetry and song-writing. Stevie was soon recommended by John Glover (who he was extensivley working with at the time) to Ronnie White, then a member of the fantastic, Smokey Robinson And The Miracles, who were signed to Detroits, Tamla Motown Records, founded by Berry Gordy who was instantly astounded by this child genius.  <br /> <br />Dubbed Little Stevie Wonder in his early career, he was rapidly signed to Motown Records, home to some of the most important names in the history of black music including Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye. It was clear from an early age that Stevie Wonder indeed was a deeply gifted singer/songwriter and muscian.  <br /> <br />Fingertips, released in 1963, proved an exhilirating masterpiece. Fingertips was virtually a harmonica instrumental but its just so totally infectious and caught onto the public like a magnet. Fingertips quickly catapulted to the top of the U.S charts and became the first in a long line of classics.  <br /> <br />It was clearly his Motown work that remained some of his most popular and compelling output. The vibrant, Uptight (Everything's Alright) was a highly infectious affair as was the more sparse production of Yesterme-Yesteryou-Yesterday. The rolling undertones of playful funk on the classic, Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours) were three classics that perharps were pure examples of how Stevie Wonder gradually adapted to more Pop styles where his work still vastly contained elements of traditional black rhythm and blues but was able to cross boundaries and break down many racial barriers (much in the way Diana Ross had). Though commercial in each of the tracks content, they all still firmly retained that earthy, soulful style, owing much to Stevies credible and unique vocal style.  <br /> <br />Stevie proved to be a masterful lyric writer and conveyed an effortless flair for ballads such as on the passionate, timeless, My Cherie Amour (written with Henry Cosby) and the more subtle and profound, A Place In The Sun.  <br /> <br />Like Marvin gaye, his work steadily progressed from the formulaic sounds of Motown to more creative, artistic and indepth material, releasing a string of quality studio albums throughout the 1970's. The startling Superstition was a sharp, nifty, funky number where Stevies voice effectivley cuts through the stark musical arrangements. He delivered a more anthemic message on the compelling, Higher Ground.  <br /> <br />The awesome, Living For The City, was an exciting, severn-minute epic which echoed the restrictions and perils of ghetto life. Much of his work steered more into profound political and social issues that perfectly captured contemporary times and deservedly gained wide acknowledgement from critics.  <br /> <br />Like Diana Ross (a close friend of the divas and he'd also written the dazzling compostion, Too Shy To Say for her 1977 studio album, Baby It's Me) his work eventually settled into the more Adult-Contemporary market that occupied the lower reaches of the charts yet fully remained an A-list novelty act. Such saccharine numbers like I Just Called To Say I Love You, may have become big cross-atlantic hits but this type of material lacks the dynamic of some of his earlier work.  <br /> <br />Even so, Stevie Wonder continues to this day to enjoy a large and loyal following. This being the definitive collection of Stevie Wonders work makes it essential to any serious Soul/R&B/Motown collection.  <br /> <br />
0671015206|4.0|My new goal is to read one book per month, the do a short review on that book. I got this goal after becoming a huge Dave Ramsey fan. I read his book, Total Money Makeover and loved it. Now I listed to his free podcasts everyday. <br /> <br />One of the books he highly recommends is The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley. This book will change the way you look at your next door neighbor, and the way you may think while driving through an upper class neighborhood. This book shows you how the tortoise continually beats the hair in the race to building wealth. <br /> <br />The book does have it's boring parts and can often read like an owners manual with lots of statistical data. But between all the stats and data the book can be highly motivating to help you save instead of spend. You'll learn all about PAWS & UAWS and what it means to have a big hat and no cattle. <br /> <br />Without going too much into it, I would say that although dull it is a good read with lots of hard core statistical surprises.
B000002N25|5.0|This was a little older than Ragpicker, Shangri-La, and Sailing to Philadelphia.  Mark has a bit more ...oomph on this album I think.  Even though all of his albums are respectfully different, and I love them all, this one is second only behind Sailing to Philadelphia in my mind.  Knopfler's guitar playing is toned down in his other solo albums...not so in this case.  It pops out at you unlike Shangri-La.  The songs are generally up-beat, and Knopfler is just having a good time.  As always, fantastic sound quality.  Highly recommended.
B00006M183|1.0|I WAS a huge PJ fan, heck I collect b-sides, imports and anything I could get my hands on.  While I still enjoy their older music I can not respect political cheapshots.  Case in Point: Bushleaguer , come on, seriously have you completely run out of ideas.  I know that they are bleeding heart liberals/socialists but could you inject some intelligence into your songs/lyrics.  Why not a song called ClintonDecay about the moral decay of our society?  I do listen to bands that don't follow my politcal leanings, i.e. SOAD.  Their song BYOB is obviously about the Iraq war but they pen it smartly.  They don't say \\"Why don't Bush,etc. fight the war?\\" instead they say \\"Why don't presidents fight the war?\\" which makes a political statement, however, it is not dated and sophmoric; heck they could be talking about the Civil War and Lincoln.
B00005U122|5.0|I recieved the DVD as a gift for my birthday a while ago. Let me start off by saying I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, but I am not obsessed by them. I listen to many kinds of music, I like Blind Guardian, Dream Theater and I even listen to harder stuff like Death Metal some times. Even thought I dabble in those things, I always have to come back to Pink Floyd to keep myself grounded. But this is not Pink Floyd... no, if it were Pink Floyd, the world would be a different place, for me at least :D <br /> <br />The sound is incredibly good in this DVD. Better go get some good surround speakers with all the good stuff. Pink Floyd will always have to right money to pay for good production. The camera work is excellent, the view is never obstructed or ambiguous like in Delicate Sound.  <br /> <br />I missed Mr. Screen (the circular screen that floyd use in their concerts), but the projections behind the musicians were very good. <br /> <br />Allright, the solos are not performed by David Gilmour, and they sound different. The musicians have done a good job, though. Snowy White has always been part of Floyd in concert, so his sound can be recognised... but Doyle Bramhall II... he was awesome. The solos on Comfortably Numb sounded a lot different from the original, but they rocked. Hard. <br /> <br />The show didn't miss on good old floyd synth lines. The synth section in the middle of Dogs is when Roger and the guys have the nerves to play some cards in the middle of a concert :D I thought that was funny. <br /> <br />Oh yes... and Roger. <br /> <br />Roger rocked. What else can I say? His voice is 70% what made the Floyd sound, and the sound is here. It was good to finally hear parts of The Final Cut live. Southampton Dock was very very good, a lot better than the album version, and quite emotional.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs on this one would have to be: <br /> <br />1) In The Flesh: the starts with an explosive barrage of flangered guitar mania. Roger looks extremelly thrilled pointing at people in the audience and ordering to have them executed. I love how he moves around on the stage showing the hammers sign, with his bass guitar hanging.  <br /> <br />2) The Final Cut part: This is like 3 or 4 songs, I can't remember correctly, but I love them. Excellent delivery. <br /> <br />3) Welcome To The Machine: This song is actually quite scary. <br /> <br />4) Dogs. Wow, just wow. This was an excellent part. People seem to want to skip over this song because it's so long, but it's worth it. A classic song that gives you the floyd feel.  <br /> <br />5) Comfortably Numb: Once again... wow. I have played the solos over and over and I just can't express how cool they are performed by the two guitarists, who harmonize together in the end to create a wonderful climax. <br /> <br />6) Each Small Candle: Amazing... amazing Roger Waters style emotion and rage. The song just seems to go deeper and deeper.  <br /> <br />Songs I don't like: <br /> <br />I feel the Dark Side of The Moon part fails to raise to expectations. Something is simply wrong... maybe because the original album relied so much on the other members to make it sound like pure Floyd. Doyle doesen't have the right voice for the job. <br /> <br />Wish You Were Here: Butchered... I think I skip over it each time. What a wonderful song and what a dreadful performance. It is clear that the album was David Gilmour's magnum opus... without him, it's nothing. <br /> <br />Shine on You Crazy Diamond: The song was pretty good, but a lot of the Floyd feeling was lost... too bad. They didn't use the right kind of distortion for the solos.  <br /> <br />In the end, I urge you to buy this album. If you are not a floyd fan, it's the perfect thing to get you into it.
B000ANXLB2|5.0|This is a DVD version of Herbert Von Karajan's great late '60s early '70s Beethoven cycle. Many of you must have purchased the original audio recordings when they were released by DG on Vinyl back then. They remain, to my ears, absolutely the best interpretations of this repetoire. I've been watching a symphony a day for the last week and they meet or surpass all expectations. The audio is crystal clear, brassy horns, piercing winds, deep resonant cellos and basses and shimmering strings. The video sets retain a bare bones \\"classic\\" almost Greek like feel, befitting early 1800s music. However, the subtle, creative use of video is very effective (the horns in the Eroica and the use of light at the climax of the 9th come to mind). Herbert Von Karajan was one of the best, if not the greatest, conductors of Beethoven. It is a treat to see his conducting style at work, the sheer strength of feeling, combined with traditional German reserve and hidden fragility of feeling. Much has been said about Karajan's clouded association with the Nazis. That being said, it does not take one iota from his talent as a great conductor. This is perhaps the best digital recording you will ever see of these works (Yes, Karajan was a pioneer of digital recording). Put aside the politics and enjoy one heck of a ride. Here's a bit of trivia. During the '70s I briefly visited Vienna. Young musicians in America sometimes carry pictures of rock star heroes in their wallets. I remember seeing a young teenaged violinist. Guess whose picture SHE had in HER wallet? You guessed it. None other than Herbert himself! LUDWIG VAN RULES AND OLD HERB LIVES ON IN DVD AS HIS CONDUCTOR!! Enjoy!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is Wilco's masterpiece album.  If you are just checking Wilco out and you're not sure where to start, start here.  This album strays from the \\"country\\" genre under which ealier Wilco is usually classified, but maintains the flow and focus that is somewhat lost in A Ghost Is Born.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot really shows off the band's stylistic range.  Upbeat poppy songs like Heavy Metal Drummer flow seamlessly into country-like songs such as Jesus, Etc. and darker songs like Poor Places.  The emotional and melodic nature of this album allows the tracks to follow each other easily, and makes the whole album feel like one piece as opposed to 11 separate tracks.  However, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a little melancholy, so beware if that's not your thing.
B000002MP2|5.0|I got Dookie shortly after my 12th birthday. I have always been a fan of punk music. So when my cousin told me to check them out I did just that. What did i have to lose right? <br /> <br />After listening to Dookie for the first time it became one of my favorite cd's right being Metallica's and Justice for all. My favorite songs soon were Longview Basket Case Coming Clean and When I come around. When I come around was the first song I learned to play on the guitar. <br /> <br />All in all it was a great cd and i was not disappointed. Even though there were some songs that I really didn't care for too much it will always be in my top 5 cd's. It was the cd that brought Green Day to popularity.  All I can Say is GO GET THIS ALBUM. With it's mix of blasting and high speed songs, catchy riffs and vocals, and incredible bass lines. It is a Must if you are a fan of punk music
0399213015|5.0|This book is one of my most favorite childhood books. It's a great book for young children to read or have read to them. The illustrations go with the story beautifully and make it come to life. I still get excited today about reading the book to anyone that will let me read it to them. Check this book out and other books by Eric Carle.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  The CD is a little different <br />from his typical style of music, but every song is <br />fantastic.  There is not one bad song on the CD.  I <br />listen to it every day.  The more I listen to the songs,  <br />the more I enjoy them.
B00080Z53O|5.0|It is a film about \\"live dignifiedly.\\" Ramon, the main role in this movie, had been struggling for his disease, quadriplegia, for over 30 years. He thought that it was not life, so he sought for euthanasia.  <br />This is a special issue. What this movie wants to tell us is about life and death. A person who lives happily can't imagine why there are people seeking for death, but Ramon did. Though it is an issue about death, I think the director still praised the beauty of life. We can see how happy Ramon was when he flied through the grass and the sea. From his fighting with the obstacles, he seemed to have a new attitude toward life. He always smiled at people who came to visit him; people around him all liked him. However, he'd said that when you couldn't escape what you faced, and when you had to lean on other people, all you could do is smiling instead of crying. I think that's also what the director wanted to show us.  <br />
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Ok. When I first heard them, I admit I did think that Brendon Urie's voice what a lot like Patrick Stump's from FOB, but now that I've listened to this CD 89765839465 times I can really tell a major difference between the two. Also, P!ATD's music more upbeat and catchy, and not as punk/emo as FOB. The lyrics are waaay better and plus Brendon can dance. =}
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've herd 3 great cd's in the past month...the new cd from CHICAGO...the new one from TOTO..and now \\"All the Roadrunning\\"....the other 2 are slick commercial masterpieces...but this new cd from Mark and Emmylou is nothing short of a pure gem...this is an amazing piece of musical talent and writing.  This cd fits like and old pair of shoes...you slide it in and your right at home from the first note...as one review said..this cd takes you back to when great cd's came along quite often...well that doesn't happen much now and the musical talent singned by record labels today is an embarrasment for the most part......THIS GIVES US HOPE that true musical genius can still survive in the world today...GOD I hope there's a sequel!!!!!
0151008116|5.0|Very rarely do I read a book and after finishing it, want to read it over again.  This is one of those rare books.   <br /> <br />Piscine Patel is an amazing character who illustrates that people of various faiths can coexist and even complement one another in their understanding of God.  While religions may profess to \\"corner the market\\" on the pathway to God, faith in Allah, Ganesha, or God are all valid. <br /> <br />Pi overcomes amazing, unbelievable odds as the ship he is sailing on across the Pacific Ocean sinks.  The only survivors in the lifeboat with Pi are a tiger, a hyena, an orangutan, and a zebra with a broken leg.  For over 200 days, Pi is able to survive while trying to keep his comrades alive. <br /> <br />Part comedy, tragedy, mystery, and romance, this book explores the savage in all of us and the lengths we will go to in order to survive.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|If you like acoustic blues and you like Eric Clapton .. you'll love  this ... if you're looking for searing guitar solos and over production this is not for you.This album is a tribute to Robert Johnson , who played acoustic blues and Clapton does a great job at replicating that sound . When you Got A Good Friend , Little Queen Of Spades , Stop Breakin Down Blues are a few examples of what is , as a whole , a very solid album.
B00005JKJA|5.0|After I watched it the 5th times I still couldn't get it out of my head. It's not that I don't understand, it's because I understand and I'm absolutely dazzled by the way David Lynch put together all the little pieces. It's the most beautiful jigsaw I ve ever seen, and it's definitely the most beautiful movie I ve ever watched. David Lynch is the greatest!  <br />(BTW, Rebekkah Del Rio's voice is wild!) <br /> <br />
0694003611|5.0|This book inspired the rest of my life. As a humble peasant I roamed the streets in search of a destiny. Then, I stumbled upon GOODNIGHT MOON!!!!! This book has the best plot, i could relate to it exactly. The themes are amazing and the characters exemplify my personality. Now as a McDonalds chef I know my life has changed.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Next year this movie will be 70 years old.It is still a visual treat!  <br />The animation is very detailed and beautiful, the colors after restoration have become full and alive. The scene where the Wicked Queen transforms herself into the old hag is still frightful and stunning.She is my favorite character of the movie.The story is funny, frightening and sweet at once. A true classic that everyone should own, regardless of how hard a copy is to buy these days...
B000002P2V|4.0|I bought this as an LP when it was first issued (still have it) and am now purchasing my second CD version as I wore out the first one.  This is Pete Townsend at his punk/rock best and longtime fans of The Who always count this among their favorites. The tracks on this CD are edgier than a lot of the previous 70's output from the band - \\"Trick of the Light\\" is one of the most underrated and underplayed songs on the album.  Pete lays down some amazing riffs that are especially appreciated when listening with headphones.  Buy it - you won't be disappointed.
B00005Q3TZ|2.0|michael bey's \\"pearl harbor\\" is one of those \\"what could have been \\" movies. with a screen play that would have been laughed at in 1941, mr bey has tied his great f/x scenes of the attack, to a love story that is the last word in corny. the number of times logic is given up in favor of the sappy love story just kills this flawed take on america's darkest day(9/11 not withstanding)!! at nearly three and a half hours it goes on forever and really after the attack there isn't much story left to tell. a very big miss fire from mr. bey and company!!!!!!!!!!!
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|As can be seen from the album jackets, there are a couple of things that Rihanna has improved since her debut album \\"Music of the Sun\\".  One of these things is that she has expanded her range from reggae/dancehall and lovers' rock to include pop and R&B.<br /><br />Hit single \\"S.O.S.\\" is an extremely catchy track, deservedly getting lots of radio play, and the best track to set the tone for the rest of the album.  Second single \\"Unfaithful\\" is the opposite - a slow pop ballad with a lot of piano in the background, similar to another track, \\"A Million Miles Away\\".  \\"We Ride\\" is another slow song, but more on the R&B side, as is the sad \\"Final Goodbye\\", \\"P.S. (I'm still Not Over You)\\" and \\"A Girl Like Me\\", with its Spanish guitar backing.<br /><br />Reggae tracks include \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" (a lover's rock beat); \\"Dem Haters\\" (again a slow beat); \\"Break It Off\\" (an energetic dancehall track with red hot Sean Paul - great track); \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" (slow jam, not the Queen song); \\"Selfish Girl\\" (another slow one); and a remix of \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\" from the first album.<br /><br />A reasonably good follow up to \\"Music of the Sun\\", but too heavy on the ballads which I don't think are her strongest area.  A few more of her trademark Dancehall tracks would have made this a much better album.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 25, 2006
0792841344|5.0|i saw this one the first time by sneaking into the movie(yes i'm that old) and was scared for a week. while it doesn't quite do that to me now the whole effect of the movie is like a nightmare you can wake up from. <br />   the plot is hard to follow at times but the tall man(a wonderful villian who will haunt your dreams)is turning people in slaves or something like that. just watch and let unfold and you won't be sorry.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I never saw Life is Beautiful when it first came out but always meant to when I found time. However, in the years since its release, I had quite forgotten about it until something I read recently rekindled my desire to view it. So I looked it up here, bought it, and enjoyed it several times. <br />The idea of a Holocaust comedy is intriguing and I sure wanted to see how something like that could be done tastefully. This film shows how that can be done. <br />Roberto Benigni is magnificent as Guido, a man who has such a cheerful outlook on life that very little can faze him for long. The film begins with Guido and a friend barreling down a twisting highway seemingly out of control in a car with failed brakes. They come into a town where a crowd lines the road awaiting the motorcade of the king and queen, not fascist officials as one reviewer said. As Guido frantically waves them aside, they think he is the king saluting and they salute him in return, and are still doing so when the real motorcade arrives with the impatient-looking royal couple inside. And the comedy continues... <br />I won't rehash the entire movie, others have done so, but suffice to say that Guido is such an irrepressible guy that he finds it within himself to have an outwardly positive attitude about everything even when all seems hopeless. <br />To me, the key parts of the film are: <br />1) The way in which he courts the beautiful Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) and persists even when it looks as though she seems almost sure to be wed to a wealthy and debonair childhood friend. How he snatches her from under that stuffed shirt's nose is hilarious. <br />2) The way he reacts to the anti-Semitism lite of fascist society. He keeps his head up, a smile on his face and tries to brush it off. When his young son Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini, asks about a sign on a shop that forbids entry to dogs and Jews, Guido deflects the emotional blow by joking that everyone has his own dislikes and that down thestreet there are other shops forbidding entry to other groups. So, since he (Guido) doesn't like Visigoths and his son doesn't like spiders, they will post a sign in their bookstore forbidding entry to Visigoths and spiders! <br />3)When Germans occupy part of Italy toward the end of the war, the soft anti-Semitism of Mussolini's regime gives way to the hard-core anti-Semitism of the Nazis. The town's Jews, Guido and Joshua among them, are rounded up and shipped out to a labor camp. When Dora informs the German commander that there must be a mistake, he looks at his list, sees that Guido and Joshua are Jews, and assures her there is no mistake at all and suggests she go home. She demands to be shipped out as well and is granted her wish. <br /> In the camp, Guido has to use all his powers of persuasion and imagination to keep the truth of their predicament from his son. He tells the doubting boy that they are in an elaborate contest to win a tank, and if he remains undiscovered, he will accrue the thousand points needed to win. How he manages to keep his son from being detected and how he keeps his spirits up, even when worry and apprehension lie just beneath his upbeat facade, is a wonder to see. His seeming optimism in the face of looming disaster even helps his fellow captives grimly endure. I don't want to give it all away, so it will suffice to say that Guido is ever the jokester to the end. <br />We've all heard the expression \\"If life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\\". Well, Life Is Beautiful is a prime example of someone doing just that. And while we all can't be happy-go-lucky types, that is the trait that let Guido carry on in what would be an untenable situation for most people. And that is the trait that helped him help his son live to see a new dawn. <br />All the lead characters give excellent performances, especially Benigni. The German characters are largely stereotypically sneering and bossy hate-filled Nazis, about the only sympathetic one being the camp doctor. There are a few scenes that are literally not credible, but even with these the movie is well worth seeing for the lessons it imparts and for the warm feelings you have at the end.
B00005JKG7|5.0|so says jamie lee curtis early on in \\"the fog\\" john carpenter's follow up to \\"halloween\\".with a little more money and more time to craft the film mr. carpenter gives us the deluxe film ghost story. and much like his hero,john ford, mr.carpenter has his stock company of players that you see in every movie.  <br />    this ghost story starts as we hear an old man telling stories to kids(john houseman is a great little role that he looks to enjoy). his last story of the night tells how the town was founded after a ship is run into the rocks and sunk after an \\"unearthly fog\\" rolled in and a fire on shore lead them astray. <br />     later that night, three fisherman sight an old sailing ship and meet very bad endings,and at midnight the whole town goes crazy.the local rev.(hal holbrock,having a ball) finds his greatgrandfathers diary and learns the people 100 years ago wrecked the ship of a leper who had lots of gold and wanted to build a coloney near the town. the town wanted the gold just not the lepers.well the lepers want the gold back and the also want payback for the 100 years under the water. <br />   the movie is creepy and very fun to watch(we even get jamie and her mom janet leigh workint together for the first time). as with most of his films the gore is very slight,so if thats what you like stay away, but if great ghost stories and a smart story are your thing you will love it.
0440234743|5.0|This was only the second book I had read by Grisham and I really enjoyed it.  It was interesting and somewhat suspenseful.  Most of the characters were pitiful, sad, unsympathetic people but that just made it interesting.  Perhaps it was Grisham's  attempt at showing the juxaposition of Rachel Lane and the siblings.  The book did offer hope and redemption and perhaps that is what touched me.  It did emphasis how money is not what is important in this world but that our relationship with God and others is what will really count.
B00005B36H|5.0|I remember about two years ago, when I heard the song lateralus and said \\"euuuuuugh its too long\\" or \\"eugggggh its too technical\\", back in the day I had a horrible taste in music. As Ive grown, Ive paid more attention to tool as Ive gotten an appreciation for the metal genre, and honestly, this album is amazing. After a few listens, this cd is incredible. The deepness and ambience tool presents is astonishing and should be acclaimed by all metal fans. Everytime I listen to Lateralus, I sense an aura that takes me to a different place. And with James Maynard Keenan's harmonic yet powerful vocals, Adam Jones' mesmerizing guitar tones, Justin Chancellor's pounding rythmic bass, and Danny Carey's incredible deep drumming, Tool are a force that cant be held back. And Lateralus proves this.
B00030590I|5.0|I've read many reviews on this and heard many opinions... now it is time for me to interject. There are some things that absolutely must be addressed.<br /><br />The action in many contemporary Eastern movies is often hard to grasp. Myth, legend, and history would (and did) have us believe that ninja, samurai, and other practitioners of martial arts were capable of superhuman feats, and this is clearly represented in motion picture form. Surely, we cannot stand on water. Granted, we cannot fly either. That being said, this movie does not gratingly or jarringly demand that you suspend your disbelief. In fact, action can hardly be said to be the focus of the film, though the main characters are virtuosos of combat.<br /><br />What IS the focus of this movie is the storytelling. Though the combination of the music and the scenery are consistently breathtaking, they are simply a backdrop to a well-woven tale that may challenge you intellectually and philosophically. There are twists abound, but they are not the gimmicks or cliches that we are growing accustomed to in the films of recent years. The movie does not build up to a single scene wherein the actors figuratively shout \\"Surprise!\\" and the credits roll while we are either left in shock or in disappointment depending on whether the twist was thought-provoking or just insulting. Though the story is for all intents and purposes told three times, it maintains a level of tension and invites the viewer to engage in internal dialogue to a much greater extent than just to ponder what will happen next. We are led to feel the losses or the successes of what we are watching unfold only to realize it was merely a deception, not only to the characters we are watching but to the audience as well! There are timeless questions of sacrifice, love, truth, happiness, politics, etc. etc. the themes that will strike close to home as we are all humans and our lives are made of such.<br /><br />My only minor disappointment while watching with this movie was the refusal to offer a truely \\"loose ends tied up\\" ending, seemingly typical of many Eastern movies of late. While I much prefer this to the Western \\"Hollywood ending\\", I have trouble not proposing more logical endings. The thing that I have come to realize is that movies are about people, and that people do not always act logically. If you cannot deduce the reasoning and the emotion behind the decisions made by the characters, that is your problem and not that of this movie. There is plenty of source material to provide multiple ample explanations.<br /><br />To sum it up, this movie is written, choreographed, filmed, acted, and scored with such loving attention that it is hard not to appreciate it. It is no stretch to realize the qualities which led Tarantino to attach his name on it it so prominently, though with all due respect not many people know what, if anything, he may have contributed (though you can find out in a few minutes if you search these reviews for his name).atching with this movie was the refusal to offer a truely \\"loose ends tied up\\" ending, seemingly typical of many Eastern movies of late.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|The previews did not show too much about this movie, so I rented this movie without fully knowing what it was about.  If guys were in the movie, and were naked and did perverse stuff like those ugly girls did, the movie would have been rated X!  Do those girls have low selfasteem or were they desperate for money?  I'm so sick and tired of seeing nacked girls in movies after movies.  I guess the movie industry only cares about catering to young immature guys with no taste then anything else.  AVOID THIS MOVIE!
B00005LK1N|5.0|Unless you're an audiomaniac, you're not really gonna notice any \\"drop-outs\\" and overall, the sound quality of this HDCD version of \\"Fragile\\" is very good.  The mini-lp sleeve packaging is a work of art and it even includes an 8-page booklet of colour pictures of the band members.  Everybody knows \\"Roundabout\\" but what struck me most about this album was the various genres that are represented here.  We have an adapted version of a movement from a Brahms' symphony, great classical solo guitar work by Steve Howe on \\"Mood For a Day\\" (my favourite piece), great hard rock on \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\", great pop on \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" and the rest are excellent tracks as well.  This is essential listening for any progressive rock fans and especially for aspiring guitarists as Steve Howe does simply brilliant work on this album.  Whichever version you decide to get, make sure you get this.  Highly recommended!
0393327655|1.0|I am a prof of philosophy and ethics, and up front will say that I am also a Christian, i.e., one who believes in the historical Jesus and the main tenets of Christianity. Now that that is out of the way, that is, now that I have shared my own agenda which is no longer hidden, I must say that I am disappointed in Harris' book on many levels. I am not disappointed because he goes on the attack mode of debunking faith over reason---not at all. I am bothered that he really does not take time to interact with the great philosphers of history, in detail. For example, it would have been interesting for Harris to interect with Augustine in his \\"Confessions,\\" to understand how he, Augustine, evolved from reason (thesis) to faith (antithesis) to the marriage of the two (synthesis) in a cogent philosophical system that rightly understood faith as an integral part of reason, and how reason relates to faith. I am left with the overall impression that Harris' own bias and hidden agenda is skewing his research and applied philosophy. Albeit, in his book he dismisses faith, but does not interface with faith itself as a necessary component of practical living itself, quite apart from religion. For example, I will go to bed tonight after a long day and as I drift off to sleep I will believe that I will wake up in the morning. Now, I may not wake up. But there is something in the human psyche that tells each of us every day that we will propositionally live out the day and make it home safely to our family. Now, here again, we may not. God forbid accidents, injury, heart attacks and all the rest. The only difference between this kind of faith and the religious kind is the object of faith. In religion, say, Christianity, my faith is in Jesus as Lord. In ordinary, pragmatic faith, while the overarching \\"faith\\" I have is in God, by practical reasoning, my faith is simply believing with a propositional outflowing of belief: I go to the mailbox believing that I will safely fetch the mailand make it back to the house without a plane falling on me. So, where is the notion of \\"the end of faith\\" if faith is really a practical part of life both within the matrix of religion and outside the paradigm of \\"reason.\\" Then there is the issue of \\"reason.\\" By what standards is faith within religion unreasonable? For example, if there is a god who spoke in time and in space through an individual, say, Jesus, and if Jesus proclaims that faith (Greek: pisteuo)or trust in God is the necessary prerequisite for etermal life, then how is that propositional statement necessarily unreasonable or untrue. In a word, it isn't by that syllogism or definition. So, where does this leave Mr. Harris? It would appear to me that Mr. Harris is applying his own definition of reason, reasonableness, rational, etc., and then using his own construct to build an argument. That is a logical fallacy which any student of philosophy should know. Thus, if there is such a notion as the end of faith in an imaginary world that Mr. Harris constructs, then can we truly construct a world in which there is the true birth of reason in a world where many of the most rational people have brought civilization to the brink of disaster? A Chairman Mao tse Tung emptied the world of 70-plus million Chinese; a Hitler depopulated the world of at least 10 million, Stalin another 50 million, Pol Pot countless millions, and the rest--all in the name of reason, what is reasonable and rational. When these \\"rational\\" dictators seized power and brought an end to the cultural \\"faith\\" of the people, did not their \\"rational\\" programs go beyond the pale to the realm of pure irrationality? Therefore, what is better, the end of faith or deeming \\"reason\\" a science that far exceeds faith? On a philosophical level, Mr. Harris' analysis produces many more questions than what he is obviously prepared to answer, and the answers he does provide are pedestrian at best, and give me the impression that he has not really done his homework. If The End of Faith is indeed a reasonable book, then, well, I will have to take it on... faith.
B00005KB9W|5.0|This live album from Bob Marley and his band The Wailers was my introduction to Bob Marley and reggae music in general.  It promptly turned all preconceived ideas I had about reggae inside out.  From that moment on, I was a believer.  The first time I saw this album, I was thinking to myself, \\"Reggae, what's so special about that? It all sounds the same, anyway.\\"  How wrong I was!    First of all, the sound is spectacular.  This performance sounds clean, fresh and lively; as if it were recorded yesterday.  Every little thing can be heard clearly.  Even so, it's not so clean that it becomes sterile and lacking in character.  There's still the energy and authenticity that gives a concert something special.    Secondly, this album has all the classic songs to make it worthwhile as an introduction to Bob Marley's music and indeed reggae in general.  Just check the track listing.      Also, the versions of the songs to be found here are fantastic and each musician is really impressive.  Anyone who says that reggae is formulated, boring or predictable has yet to give this album a chance.  This version of The Wailers has a real western/rock oriented approach to the music and it's really easy to hear why they have begun to appeal to a rock audience.  Besides, the playing is fantastic and has plenty of feeling.    You shouldn't any more reasons to buy this album.  It is just plain fantastic and made a staunch believer and convert out of me.
B00005JOYA|3.0|As an avid player of the Silent Hill games, I believe that gamers will find some disappointment in the movie. I waited a year for this film to hit the theaters with much anticipation. That anticipation increased after seeing recent pictures and trailers. But after just seeing the film, I regretfully feel the film failed to replicate the horror that Silent Hill first gave birth to back when I was still in high school.<br /><br />To judge which of the four games inspired the movie, one would say the film took aspects of all four. The story more or less combines with the first and third game, but mostly the first. Instead of Harry losing his daughter to the town, it's a woman named Rose. She collects little articles her daughter leaves behind that tell her to visit places like the school or the hospital.<br /><br />Along the way she discovers members of some weird Christian cult that wants to abolish the evil which governs the town. The director or script writer may have gotten this idea from the third game. Unfortunately, the cult in the movie differs so much from the cult in the game that Silent Hill fans will quickly shake their heads in confusion. As fans of the genre already know, the cult wanted to resurrect and spread the evil, not abolish it. It was a mistake to change the original plot, which tries to turn the story into a traditional battleground of good and evil, which sinks this otherwise promising film into yet another lousy mainstream showcase. Not as bad as the remake to the Fog, but not good enough for Silent Hill, for sure.<br /><br />What the film dose keep original is the look of the town and the monsters, which both come straight from the second game. The film uses music from all the games. And the nightmare world which encompasses the town every time the siren screams is a very accurate depiction of Silent Hell.<br /><br />Too bad each shift into the nightmare realm is very short lived, trying to reach a climax, but never quite getting there. The Rose character just runs around screaming until she eventually escapes from the monstrosities. Instead of wasting so much movie time on a silly Christian cult, the makers of this film should have sacrificed more time scourging our poor Rose. They should have made her endure anguish and torment beyond what her mental faculties can withstand, cripplingly her mentally, so that she resolves to curling up in a dark corner and laughs away her sanity.<br /><br />The horror in this movie was too weak to be called Silent Hill.<br /><br />And it will be a long time before we get anything (in literature, in movies, or in games) that will surpass the fear that Silent Hill 1 and 2 has struck into the hearts of people across the globe.e.

0060751967|4.0|Warning:  Do not read this book in public unless you are prepared for others to look askance at you while you laugh uncontrollably! <br />  <br />    Vampire coven master Roman Draganesti needs a dentist immediately after breaking off one of his fangs in VANNA, the Vampire Artificial Nutritional Needs Appliance (a sex toy with blood coursing through it), and Dr. Shanna Whelan is the only dentist available in the middle of the night.  Unfortunately, she is targeted for assassination by Ivan Petrovsky; Shanna is in the Witness Protection Program after testifying against the Russian Mafia hit she saw while innocently eating out with a friend.  Roman rescues her from the hit only to find out she's also terrified of blood!  Roman assists with that fear but will Ivan give up that easily?  And what exactly does Shanna's father really do for a living, anyway? <br /> <br />     The laughs keep coming in this Kerrelyn Sparks vampire novel.  Shanna is a strong woman who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to speak her mind- even to a bunch of supposedly blood-sucking demons!  Her sassiness and intelligence have kept her sane while coping with the Mafia hit and serve her well as she meets a variety of very different vampires.  She doesn't flinch at the Highlanders in their kilts or the geeky chemist, Laszlo, although she does put her foot down about Roman's harem. <br /> <br />     Readers will appreciate the wit and ingenuity of Sparks as she has created an all-vampire television network, DVN, with host Corky Courrant.  The drinks for vampires are particularly amusing- Chocolood was a hit with the female vampires but Blood Lite came into existence as the women started to get fat! <br /> <br />     The women of Ivan and Roman's harem provide a lot of hilarity as well- from their constant complaining about the lack of sex to the demands that women be given more rights.  This book is sure to delight vampire romance lovers everywhere!   <br /> <br />Courtesy of CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES
B000002U82|5.0|I just bought the album over the weekend and I can't stop listening to it. I listen to it about two times per day and I can't get tired of it. There's something new everytime I hear it. I lay on my bed and just listen to this straight through. It calms my nerves and relieves any stress. It keeps my mind open. I have never been able to do that with another other. Every song is amazing! It is best when listened to completely straight through. The songs overlap and make it seem as it is one excellent piece. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... especially for a first Pink Floyd album. <br /> <br />Best songs: Speak to Me/Breathe, Time, Money, Us and Them, Brain Damage, and Eclipse
014017821X|5.0|Carter's collection sheds a feminist retelling of many famous fairy tales.  I especially liked what she did with Blackbeard and the Puss in Boots.   <br /> <br />Included in this collection is the story behind the film, \\"In the Company of the Wolves.\\"   <br /> <br />Don't come to this collection expecting Grimm's.  Come to it expecting great storytelling and interesting perspectives on the tales we thought we knew so well.
B000EQH2QK|3.0|Shakira has a recognizable raspy voice. The lyrics are well-written in a very descriptive way. This should not go wrong, but still does not hit home like Laundry Service did. It starts with a provocative song, but then follow a string of love songs to her boyfriend and past boyfriends. To tell the truth they all sound the same and are too safe. Then she ends with a bang (Timor) and makes us ask for more. And I'm sure we will hear more!    01 How Do You Do: Mid-tempo tune about questioning religion when there's so much fighting. Good hooks and brilliant of Shakira to use this anti-war track to open the album. 4/5    02 Illegal: This ballad song reminds me of Underneath Your Clothes and I immediately take a liking to the chorus. About the way she's been hurt and how that someone could do that to her. 4/5    03 Hips Don't Lie: This is the reason I purchased the album. It's an anti-war flamenco-club song with very cool rhythm and cheaky lyrics. I miss more text, but still worth five points. 5/5    04 Animal City: Fame and fortune it not all its cracked up to be. It's an uptempo rocking track with good hooks, but could have been better lyrically. 3/5    5. Don't Bother: Shakira in fine shape telling her man to go with that other girl because they're more suited for eachother. 4/5     06 The Day And The Time: This is your average album filler. Mid-tempo track using too many metaphors. It goes under the string of soft ballads dedicated to her bf. 1/5     07 Dreams For Plans: Safe ballad. She is asking her bf if she has let her career take over her life and if it has changed their lives too much. 3/5    08 Hey You: Yet another song dedicated to her bf. This is a mid-tempo love decleration. I think it's intended to be a bit sassy, but it sounds a bit like a pink panther theme. 2/5    09 Your Embrace: This begins where track 6 ended. We get the point now! 2/5    10 The Costume Makes The Clown: Shakira comes clean what concerns Laundry Service and admits she couldn't stand formany of the songs she sang. Good melody and good lyricwork, but the song doesn't seem coherent. 3/5    11 Something: This is the worst song on this album. SLOW song about a previous lover. Album filler. 1/5    12 Timor: This is another provocative song, probably about the US's policy towards smaller countries \\"If we forget about 'em  Don't worry. If they forget about us\\", but it's named Timor (which was invaded in 1975 by Indonesia, but achieved full independence in 2002) so I could be wrong. 5/5    13 La Tortura: I never understood why this was such a hit. A hit on the dancefloor probably, but I can't relate to it. 2/5
B000092ZYX|1.0|Terri, Terri, Terri.  When will you learn?  Radiohead is a bunch of pompous poseurs who make Coldplay look like the Second Coming.  \\"All Hail the Thief\\" is a mediocre album that flopped and, as a result, Radiohead were DROPPED from Capitol/EMI.  And what does Terri know about Luther Vandross.  Terri is a racist who knows nothing about r&b.  Just get the live DVD from Destiny's Child instead.
B000EQ4G5K|2.0|After hearing Rihanna's 3 latest hits (recent hit: S.O.S.) I decided to purchase this album. I was expecting floorfillers with exotic rhythms, but ended up with a CD filled with slow songs that need to be remixed quite a bit if they're going to hit the dancefloor. Overall it is an OK - at times boring - mellow CD and Rihanna manages to show off her amazing vocals. Buy this CD if you liked Rihanna's previous CD or if you're into soft R'n'B tunes, but don't expect to find any tracks to even come close to S.O.S. Lyrically it is very good, but the melodies could have needed a quality control as they all sound the same. I understand she is only 17, but there are a lot of other subject than love to choose from, but she hasn't. The singles will stand out enough to not make her a has-been.     01 - SOS: You've already heard this poppy up-tempo dance number. Definitely the best song on the album. 5/5    02 - Kisses Don't Lie: An up-tempo dance number with a catchy beat to the chorus, but it doesn't deliver all the way. 3/5    03 - Unfaithful: Excellent lyrical work with a good melody and a good choice as second single from this album. You hear her voice is not fully mature, but it blends in good. 5/5     04 - We Ride: About being cheated to and ending a relationship because the other part ruined it. The \\"We ride\\" hook is catchy but the rest of the song is like every other song on this CD. 3/5    05 - Dem Haters: Dealing with the people who didn't believe in her and jealousy concerning her career. Again; good lyric work,but the melody is constant and there is no hook, catchy edge or anything else for that matter. 1/5    06 - Final Goodbye: The arrangements remind me of Seal's Kiss From a Rose. Slow ballad, some sort of love decleration and promise to be there till the end. 2/5    07 - Break It Off: A cheeky floorfiller with raggae beats, but Rihanna only has one verse she repeats constantly (exept for the ending verses). IMO; the song would have been better off WITHOUT Sean Paul. He ruins the entire song for me, but it will be a winner on the dancefloor. 4/5    08 - Crazy Thing Called Love: The lyrics are corny, but mainly she just sings \\"crazy thing called love\\" over and over again and how this one guy opened up her eyes for it. This is a serious albumfiller. 1/5    09 - Selfish Girl: Melody-wise it sounds like it begins where the previous track ended, but a tad catchier with a carribbean tune in focus. And lyric-wise.. \\"feeling like I do.. need you night and day..\\" Still it has an independent woman flavour over it; saying she won't share her man. 2/5    10 - P.S. I'm Still Not Over You: A tender ballad about a past lover she is not over yet. It touches all the thoughts we are left with when after a breakup with that special someone. Good lyric work, but the melody falls flat as there are no remarkable arrangements. 2/5    11 - A Girl Like Me: Mid-tempo track about being different from the rest and the need to be accepted like she is from the boy who is going to be with her. 2/5    12 - Million Miles Away is a passionate ballad about being together, but at the same time far apart. Its got a catchy chorus and safe lyrics. Buyers outside the U.S. should be relieved this is the last song on their CD. 3/5    *BONUS TRACKS*  13 - If It's Lovin' That You Want (remix): This remix is also slower than the original song. What's the point? Will the next album include a S.O.S. remix? 2/5    14. Who You Gonna Run To: When you include bonus tracks you still need to make sure they go through the quality control. This is the worst song on the album. Asking her bf who he's gonna run to when everyone else turns on him. 1/5    15 - Pon De Replay (remix): You've heard it and know it's a cool floorfiller. Surprisingly - and disappointingly -, this remix is slower than the original song! 3/5    16. You Coulda Been The One: No surprises here. I'm getting tired of writing the same thing over and over again so I'm guessing she's as tired of singing the same song over and over again. 1/5
B000F0UV0E|5.0|A friend who is a more experienced meditator than my husband and me suggested that we try meditating to this album.  We all usually do a Buddhist sitting meditation, where you pay attention to your breathing in one way or another, but this time he proposed that we make \\"hearing\\" the object of attention.<br /><br />What a fantastic way to listen to this wonderful album, and it made for an unusual and deep meditation for all three of us.  (Interestingly, our meditator friend thought it would be best for the FIRST hearing, when the music would be completely fresh.)<br /><br />It was almost a guilty pleasure.  \\"I Dug Up a Diamond\\" was especially apt for our listening situation.  \\"Belle Starr\\" is a heartfelt, novel take on a love song, and \\"Love and Happiness for You\\" is the title to write on a Post-It Note when you send this album as a gift to someone you love.  Harris and Knopfler's voices and songwriting complement each other like scrambled eggs and bacon.  Some of those guitar notes gave me physical chills, which also is a typical response to Harris's uniquely soaring vocals.  Having heard a few of the tracks on the radio before the album was released, I suspected this CD would be a winner, and I have been fully rewarded.<br /><br />Although I haven't seen Mark Knopfler in concert, I've had the pleasure of seeing Emmylou Harris at several of the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass concerts in San Francisco (thank you, Warren Hellman!!).  She's one of those \\"must see\\" performers, who makes every stage appearance seem like the one she's been looking forward to the most.<br /><br />So even if you don't want to \\"sit in meditation\\" with this album, listening to it with undivided attention will benefit you with its rewards and charms.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I heard one song from this band (Time is Running Out) and had to have the CD, after buying the CD, I had to have ALL their albums. There is a reason that Muse is one of the hottest bands in the UK, because they have a unique sound, huge vocal range, gripping hooks and beats and above all TALENT!<br /><br />This is one of those albums that you can listen to from start to finish without skipping tracks. It also makes you want to sing/scream/dance like a fool. Buy this CD you wont regret it!!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|It's funny, I've seen 3 previous Kubrick movies before this: A Clockwork Orange, the Shining and 2001. Only the Shining I liked as Clockwork seemed kind of boring and 2001 seemed really slow at times. Dr Strangelove is one of the few that I like and although I didn't find it a laugh riot all the way through, its satire and funny dialogue was perfect, and the performances were great as well. <br /> <br />An Air Force commander goes nuts and convinces a fleet of planes that Russia is planning an attack so he calls for an action to nuke them. The film switches between 3 locales mainly: the War Room with the President and other government officials, the crazy commander and a soldier trying to get him to stop and inside the plane, on their way to bombing Russia. <br /> <br />The performances are quite excellent with George C. Scott playing quite an animated Officer while Peter Sellers plays no less than 3 roles: the President, Mandrake, the officer trying to stop the rogue commander and Dr Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist in a wheelchair. Then of course there's Slim Pickens who replaced what was supposed to be Peter Sellers' 4th character as Major Kong. Also look for James Earl Jones, later being of course the voice of Darth Vader. <br /> <br />One of the most well-known images of the film is Major King yahooing on the nuclear bomb all the way down to annihilation. Whether this was the first time that a big vertical tracking shot was shown but it sure seems familiar now. Pearl Harbor's infamous shot, the boulder in Return of the King and even the end to Temple of Doom had similar shots so either this was the start or it was another homage but it's certainly a famous shot. <br /> <br />It's best if you go with the Anniversary Edition since the image is more cleaner. I watched the SE and there was print flaws all over the place. There's a couple new features which probably doesn't seem like much but for the best looking, get the Anniversary edition.  <br /> <br />It's certainly a funny movie and a well-made one and Kubrick, who is usually known for precision and coldness rather than emotional films, it's nice to see one that I actually like.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|The first time I heard this album I wasn't impressed. I thought it was lacking from all the other album. Then Infa-Red caught my fancy, followed by Song to Say Goodbye and then slowly other tracks started finding their way on my mp3 player. Its the same thing that happend the first time I ever listend to this band's music, it starts with one song that you like and then before you know it, you have the CD playing over and over again.<br /><br />Its almost impossible to pick a favorite...this album will not disappoint.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Only thing is it isn't an adaptation. The game Final Fantasy VII was released in 1997 and it had quite an ambigious ending. After the sequel to Final Fantasy X came out, the first sequel for the series ever, Squaresoft(later renamed Square-Enix) expanded on VII's storyline and now there's a PS2 game, a PSP game, a short anime and this film which is wildly anticipated. Speaking as a fan, it's quite fulfilling although some people might find one issue with it. <br /> <br />In order to understand this movie you need backstory: basically the Shinra Company is sucking Mako energy from the Planet(think of it as the Planet's blood in a sense) and no more Mako then no more Planet. Cloud and a group of friends is trying to take them down and also a man named Sephiroth, a feared and powerful Soldier. They succeed in beating him and a meteor he summoned is vanquished, only to do heavy damage to a huge city known as Midgar. If it sounds confusing I'm sorry, this movie does have a backstory and it's called Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br />In this film it's 2 years later, and Cloud has kind of become an anti-social loner. 3 Silver-Haired Men show up looking for \\"Mother\\" and believe Cloud is the one to lead them to her. To make matters worse, certain people are infected with Geostigma, a disease that eventually will prove fatal. So the film's really about Cloud and his merry friends trying to save the world again. <br /> <br />It's funny how game players understand the plot while Everyman is kind of \\"huh?\\". What plagued Spirits Within was most couldn't understand it. I did since I'm quite the game player but it baffled mostly everyone else. Advent Children solves this by putting in a small plot and a massive number of action sequences. It does seem like a feeling of style over substance but it's probably the coolest style you'll ever see. Speaking of which, the action sequences are great being exciting and frenetic, one hiccup is that the camera seems overly busy and with characters going turbo speed it's hard to tell what they're doing at times. The big fight in the end is of course extremely awesome and you'll probably watch the scene again once it's finished. <br /> <br />Another highlight is its visuals, this is one gorgeous movie and will certainly be one of the prettiest movies in your collection. Some noticed artifacts and such now and then but Square, known for their awesome FMV's in their games show off their talents here and it's stunning at times. The music seems kind of constant without much breaks but it's great anyway although big-time classical fans might hate the metal influences that repeatedly show up. It worked on the FF VII boss theme but here, I don't know, it works half the time. <br /> <br />If you've played Final Fantasy VII, you'll love it but you may not like the over abundance of action scenes and the lack of screen time for the rest of the gang. If you haven't played it, you might like it but you probably will have no idea what you're watching and won't make any sense at all. Not to me though.
B000CDIOYO|5.0|This version of the St. Matthew's Passion, conducted by Karl Richter, is a wonderful performance, Peter Scherier as the evangilist domanates the performance, with his fantasic voice. <br />The choir and orchestra play perfect together not a flaw can be heard. <br />I have waited 35 years to hear this performance again, I first saw it on my PBS TV station when I was 12 years old, and never forgot it.
B000286RKW|5.0|It was odd but I remember that my dad had a massive VHS collection and starting to become a film freak, I decided to watch a whole lot from Godfather 1-3 to Schindler's List to this one. It's funny how little I actually remembered of them. Yeah I remember the \\"how am I funny?\\" scene, the news on the payphone and one character's faux-made scene but I kind of forgot about it. Recently I decided to check it out and again and it was as great as I knew it was the first time, what little I remembered of it anyway. While I still see Raging Bull as a Scorsese masterpiece, this one is too. <br /> <br />The film, based on a true story, follows Henry Hill who gets involved with the mafia. Loving the idea at an early age he becomes a junior member, and helping out. As he gets older, he's dealing with everything that comes with it, including what happens when you kill a made man without a hit being called, as well as federal officers and a growing drug habit. <br /> <br />Some people might regard this as Godfather lite, a kind of ripoff passed off as something on its own. The only thing it's got in common is the whole mafia angle, that and Robert De Niro, who was in Part II. Godfather is about showing the inner workings of the top brass of the \\"families\\", this film's more about the soldiers, the so-called muscle who do all the jobs and handle the business personally. Sometimes they have to get quite violent including one unlucky guy who gets stabbed AND shot. The film's not as outright violent as I've seen but they're are some pretty un-kid friendly stuff here. <br /> <br />Performance-wise it's solid across the board. In an odd segue, George Lucas said he didn't want to work with Harrison Ford for Indiana Jones because of American Graffiti and the Star Wars trilogy, saying \\"I don't want my own Bobby De Niro\\". Well Scorsese is a huge fan of Robert De Niro, off the top of my head I count Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, the King of Comedy, Mean Streets, New York New York andCape Fear. Wow, lot of movies, good luck charm or just easy casting? Not to fear, he's reliable and he's great here too. <br /> <br />Another Scorsese repeat(although not as often), Joe Pesci returns in another performance of a manic character but that's alright. Although I don't like the laugh, Ray Liotta does a good job as Henry Hill but my personal favorite is Lorraine Bracco playing his wife, Karen. Perfect at first but then goes more and more crazy until her craziness matches Henry's. Everybody else is great too, including a too-quick cameo by Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br />It's of course quite a great film and a film classic in its own right which should be enough to warrant a purchase, but however, try your local video store for a try, you never know, you might hate it. I didn't though. <br /> <br />
B0000648WZ|5.0|Bedtime story, from Papa Bush to his young 'uns: Once upon a time, a long time from now, there was a United Earth.  A New World Order of peace, prosperity and freedom.  Everyone was clean and pretty and healthy.  Good genes, all around.  Black people too.  And the streets were clean, and the environment, and the trains ran on time.  Then one day, bad monsters attacked Earth, because the monsters were evil and ugly, and looked like giant bugs (because they were giant bugs), and they hated anybody lucky enough to have so much peace, prosperity and freedom, and who were so good-looking.<br /><br />But luckily for the happy people of Earth, their world government had the bestest military in the universe, with lots of gnarly weapons and way cool uniforms.  So  everyone enlisted like crazy to fight the ultimate war between good and evil.  The politicos and top brass called it the Bug War -- but for the young recruits, it was the kick-ass adventure of a lifetime!<br /><br />The bugs never had a chance.  The end.<br /><br />No, not a bedtime story, but Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, a dead-on satire of post-9/11 war hysteria -- astonishing because it was released in 1997!<br /><br />The film's satire was originally aimed at its source material: Robert Heinlein's 1959 novel, Starship Troopers (condemned by some critics upon publication as \\"fascistic\\").  But like humor-impaired Trekies, many Heinlein fans remained clueless and unamused.  They complained that the film had replaced Heinlein's socio-political military philosophy with mindless bug battles.  Few realized the joke was on them.  Verhoeven didn't so much ignore Heinlein's philosophizing as lampoon it.<br /><br />Heinlein's novel paints a future Earth in which everyone enjoys equal rights and liberties -- except to vote and hold office, which are reserved only to those who complete military service.  Enlistment is voluntary and non-discriminatory; any sex, any age.  Blue-haired grannies can sign up.  But no special treatment.  Many softies die in the sadistically brutal boot camps.  (However, you can quit anytime, without reprisal).  Another rule: everyone fights.  Cooks, supply clerks, nurses, medics, privates, generals.  No paper pushers or desk warmers in Heinlein's military.<br /><br />Verhoeven's Starship Troopers parodies Heinlein's romanticized military culture by trivializing and sanitizing war.  Soldiers are sexy and clean even after battle, ready to party hardy.  Ready to die.  Dina Meyer's deathbed speech satirizes an old war film clich?: while reaffirming her love for her main squeeze, she nobly adds that she has \\"no regrets\\" about her sacrifice.<br /><br />For \\"red shirt\\" soldiers, death is less sentimental.  Quick -- and quickly forgotten.  After shooting a captured soldier (to prevent a painful bug death) Michael Ironside curtly informs his platoon: \\"I expect you to do the same for me.\\"  Which they do.<br /><br />Starship Troopers was no big hit in 1997, but it has its fans, many of whom -- judging by review postings on Amazon.com -- confuse the film for a serious sci-fi epic with a \\"war is hell\\" message.  (Not surprisingly, post-9/11 postings are more likely to \\"get it\\".)<br /><br />Those who doubt the film's satirical intent should consider one hero's uniform, which can best be described as neo-Third Reich.  Clearly, Verhoeven's film was not informed by Heinlein's libertarian fans, but by those critics who interpreted the novel as fascistic.<br /><br />Also noteworthy, the film's stars are all strikingly attractive with well-chiseled Aryan features.<br /><br />However, their SS physiques are not part of the plot, but merely a hint at the film's underlying satire.  Plotwise, Federal Service (as it's called) is open to all, and the Aryan protagonists warmly welcome their sidekicks of color.  In one brief scene, a dumpy black female is appointed as the new Sky Marshall, promising to \\"take the war to the bugs.\\"<br /><br />However, because many moviegoers confuse fascism with racism, and because most of them were unfamiliar with the novel, the film's satire was lost on many.  For most moviegoers, the film was just vapid soldiers shooting giant bugs.  Further obscuring the satire, the soldiers were just too damn sexy, the bugs too mean and ugly.  We humans are inclined to sympathize with attractive people, which is why satirists often paint their targets in hideous garb (communists as pigs in George Orwell's Animal Farm, and as grotesque vampires in my own Vampire Nation).<br /><br />Starship Troopers takes the opposite tact, painting globalist fascism as imagined by globalist fascists.  Everyone is healthy and happy and sexy.  The satire is in the exaggeration of fascist ideals (as in Norman Spinrad's The Iron Dream).  With unwavering fortitude and unshakable confidence in Earth's inevitable total victory, Denise Richards flashes her Pepsident smile throughout the film.  In hairy battles, her mouth may turn sexily pouty, but her brilliant teeth soon return, vast and blinding, equally at home on a TV commercial and an SS recruiting poster.<br /><br />Want to laugh out loud?  The funniest scenes are the recruiting ads and \\"news\\" propaganda bulletins.  One \\"news\\" item features warmly grinning soldiers distributing bullets to the delighted squeal of eager schoolkids.  (How clueless do you have to be to post reviews at Amazon praising the film's \\"war is hell\\" message?)<br /><br />But the clueless are out there.  Unfamiliar with the book, smitten with the sexy stars and repelled by the bugs, many didn't \\"get\\" the jokes.  In practical terms, until 9/11 Starship Troopers was a satire without a target.  The war hysteria following 9/11 provided that, the players and events stepping tailor-made into the film's sites with amazing prescience, granting the film a powerful resonance that was lacking when it was first released.<br /><br />All the parallels are present.  The enemy -- the Bugs -- are pure evil.  The military, the news reports, the war, the government, are all beyond question.  If they make a mistake, they can be trusted to correct it.  United Earth we stand.<br /><br />The Bug War begins with a Bug attack on a city.  In the film's eeriest scene, a burning building's framework resembles the Twin Towers.  Also remarkable are the many random jokes that find a target post-9/11.  In adapting a 1950s book to a 1990s sensibility, Verhoeven tossed in some contemporary satirical barbs unconnected to the book, or even to much of anything in 1997 -- but which eerily resonate with our post-9/11 war culture.<br /><br />There is the film's black female Sky Marshall, a kooky but satirically pointless joke in 1997.  Yet it's a role tailor made for Condoleezza Rice.  There are the TV war correspondents, absent in the book, but today stationed in Iraq.  They pester the soldiers in battle, don't appreciate the threat, and are killed by the bugs.  There are the TV pundits who would understand the bugs, woolly and ineffectual as seen through the film's fascist prism (the New World Order likes to see itself as tolerant).<br /><br />Starship Troopers is a penetrating satire of post-9/11 war hysteria as might be imagined by an idealistic New World Order fascist.  It's hard to believe it was made pre-9/11; impossible to think it could be made post-9/11.  Starring Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey, and Michael Ironside.film's satire was lost on many.  For most moviegoers, the film was just vapid soldiers shooting giant bugs.

The satire is in the exaggeration of fascist ideals (as in Norman Spinrad's The Iron Dream).  With unwavering fortitude and unshakable confidence in Earth's inevitable total victory, Denise Richards flashes her Pepsident smile throughout the film.  In hairy battles, her mouth may turn sexily pouty, but her brilliant teeth soon return, vast and blinding, equally at home on a TV commercial and an SS recruiting poster.     Want to laugh out loud?  The funniest scenes are the recruiting ads and \\"news\\" propaganda bulletins.  One \\"news\\" item features warmly grinning soldiers distributing bullets to the delighted squeal of eager schoolkids.  (How clueless do you have to be to post reviews at Amazon praising the film's \\"war is hell\\" message?)     But the clueless are out there.  Unfamiliar with the book, smitten with the sexy stars and repelled by the bugs, many didn't \\"get\\" the jokes.  In practical terms, until 9/11 Starship Troopers was a satire without a target.  The war hysteria following 9/11 provided that, the players and events stepping tailor-made into the film's sites with amazing prescience, granting the film a powerful resonance that was lacking when it was first released.     All the parallels are present.  The enemy -- the Bugs -- are pure evil.  The military, the news reports, the war, the government, are all beyond question.  If they make a mistake, they can be trusted to correct it.  United Earth we stand.     The Bug War begins with a Bug attack on a city.  In the film's eeriest scene, a burning building's framework resembles the Twin Towers.  Also remarkable are the many random jokes that find a target post-9/11.  In adapting a 1950s book to a 1990s sensibility, Verhoeven tossed in some contemporary satirical barbs unconnected to the book, or even to much of anything in 1997 -- but which eerily resonate with our post-9/11 war culture.     There is the film's black female Sky Marshall, a kooky but satirically pointless joke in 1997.  Yet it's a role tailor made for Condoleezza Rice.  There are the TV war correspondents, absent in the book, but today stationed in Iraq.  They pester the soldiers in battle, don't appreciate the threat, and are killed by the bugs.  There are the TV pundits who would understand the bugs, woolly and ineffectual as seen through the film's fascist prism (the New World Order likes to see itself as tolerant).     Starship Troopers is a penetrating satire of post-9/11 war hysteria as might be imagined by an idealistic New World Order fascist.  It's hard to believe it was made pre-9/11; impossible to think it could be made post-9/11.  Starring Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey, and Michael Ironside.
B000AP04FG|3.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a light-hearted action comedy of no substance.  It's the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac combo meal.  The Smiths are both suprisingly amusing, Mr. Smith particularly charming.  Mrs. Smith's an ass-kicker in the vain of Lara Croft.  The movie's pace is very quick and never lets the viewer get bored. It's worth the couple dollars it costs to rent it.<br /><br />Just don't watch this movie if you're hoping for anything original, creative or mentally stimulating.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a blow-em-up movie with a few witty one-liners, nothing more, nothing less.  If you just want to sit back and enjoy a good (over-the-top) car chase or gunfight, get it.  Not that it's the best action comedy flick out there, but it'll do.  McDonald's doesn't make the best hamburgers but sometimes they really hit the spot.<br /><br />[It's really a 2.5 star movie, but I've rounded up rather than down]
1400079179|3.0|I engaged in this read after years of resistance: all of my coworkers and many friends had read it and talked about it ad nauseum.  I vowed to wait for paperback and finally gave in to the swell of popular acclaim.  I'm mostly glad I did so.<br /><br />Like many other Amazon reviewers, I found the quality of writing and character development mediocre at the best of times.  I'm hardly a literary snob, but the quality of simile and metaphor in this book left much to be desired.<br /><br />However, the writing is not the point of this book.  The point is the string of esoteric research that the novel deftly strings together, or occasionally presents out of context.  And what fun, thought-provoking research it was.  Some of the ideas were repeats of what I learned in college, and some were brand new to me.  Many devout Christian acquaintances have told me they enjoyed the book \\"as fiction\\", stressing the \\"as fiction\\" portion: I'm not entirely sure why.  Although the book seems to bash organized religion from the outset, it really serves more as a warning against desperation, greed, and fanaticism.  I thought the modern Catholic church came out fairly unscathed, if somewhat staid.<br /><br />I did find two print errors in my copy:  one was a simple typo, the other was a \\"***\\" instead of a page number on one page.  These aren't critical errors, but for a high-profile book that stayed so long in hardcover before transitioning to a medium I could afford, I was disappointed to see that the publishers didn't think highly enough of the customer to deliver a perfect product.<br /><br />Anyhow, it's a fun read, but definitely not a \\"must-read\\".
0739326740|5.0|I am not a typical book reader, especially for personal enjoyment.  As more and more peers of mine purchased the book and read it, they highly recommended it to me.  I thought I would give it a try, and thourogly enjoyed ever page from the first to the last.  It is very suspenseful and well written in every chapter and every page.  The plot continues to thrill and take serious turns persuading the reader to continue to read the book and ponder the events that surround the main character, Robert Langdon, and his female compainion, Sophie.<br /><br />The basic plot of the story will make the reader discover that the quest for the Holy Grail is not a question of where, but a matter of what exactly the Holy Grail is.<br /><br />Highly recommended and well written.
0740748475|2.0|I used to be fond of that comic strip as it was released daily in your paper. <br />but 15 years or so later, it looks like the strip really lacks diversity. it always gets back to a very limited amount of key issues or gags and over 25 pounds later (it's heavy not only because of its completeness but also because the publisher obviously picked the heaviest stock available) you're getting bored of the same situation coming over and over again. <br />not to mention the average job the publisher did at designing the set. <br />you might want to stick to your old soft paperbacks.

0767836324|5.0|Sometimes I think movie critics are the stupidest people in the world! If you don't like Peter Pan or fantasy, then yes, you won't like this film, but you have no authority to criticize it either.  I don't pretend to like horror movies so I wouldn't watch them or presume to judge them. Let someone who likes them critique them. <br />   That said, for fans of Peter Pan, especially the original book, this movie is the funniest, most intelligent homage to the myth possible. It captures the irreverent tone of the book without the typical modern sly disrespect of  fairy tales.  Almost every word of dialogue is perfect in hilarity or poignancy. It makes you laugh and cry alternatively. The movie is packed with more 'moments' than you could believe would fit in a movie (though it is over 2 hours) without feeling forced or over-stuffed; it flows beautifully.  The writers were geniuses with the concepts here -- a grown up Pan who is  afraid to fly, kids as happy thoughts, the symbol of the sword,the watch, and baseball. Don't miss Tootles' marbles, Hook's hilarious suicide attempt, Jack's picture of the plane crashing, the jogging chant, or the cell phone and lawyer jokes. <br />Wendy's performance is awe - inspiring, and the music is wonderful. <br />I missed not having Indians, but realize it would completely not have worked in this movie.  <br />Peter Pan is often used as a symbol of selfishness, so what better theme than to watch him finally 'get it.' Growing up in all the worst ways, and then in all the right ways are the thematic bookends to the movie. Some may find it smarmy, but it is an important lesson to learn and a great bridge from Victorian England, where most where grown up in both the right and wrong ways, to modern America where many don't grow up at all.  Most women and kids long for men to pay attention. <br />If you are the kind of person who thinks Pirates of the Carribean was one of the best movies ever, you would probably love Hook. They are the onlyones that could concievably be considered similar. And by the way, all the kids love it!
B00005MKA3|5.0|While it is true that Bob Marley was not the FIRST Reggae singer, he was certainly the most famous.<br />This unique reggae beat, with the pulsations of black nationalism, was released in 1979, and has since make it's mark in the world of music. It starts with the hearty lamentation of \\"So Much Trouble in the World\\" and is followed by \\"Zimbabwe\\" which was a song of inspiration for Zimbabwe's guerrillas fighting for Black majority rule in that country during the Rhodesian War/ War of Independence. Marley performed at Zimbabwe's independence celebrations of 18 April 1980. He did not know that the performance on the first day would be reserved for the special guests of the new elite. When the masses tried to attend the concert they where tear-gassed and hounded out the stadium by Mugabe' s militia.<br />Marley responded by singing \\"War\\". The next day his performance was subdued as he was already disillusioned by the behaviour of the new Mugabe regime.<br /><br />Today the song `Zimbabwe' is sung as an anthem of Zimbabwe's pro-democracy movement against the Mugabe tyranny as are other Marley hits like ` Get Up, Stand Up\\"<br />It is clear that Marley would not have approved of the genocidal dictatorship that Mugabe built up, in the last 26 years, any more than he did the white minority government of Ian Smith.<br /><br />There is the angry condemnation of the `Babylon System' and the Black Nationalist anthem \\" Survival\\" with the lyrics \\" Were the survivors! The Black survivors!\\"<br /><br />This was one of my first albums so the heady beat of this album holds great memories for me.<br /><br />\\"Africa Unite\\" is another is an ode to Marley's idealistic dreams of Pan African unity. And ` One Drop' is spiritual rendition of the longing for a true spiritual Rastafarian quest for authentic ideas of Haile Sellasie (the Christ of Rastafari) and Marcus Garvey.<br />\\" Give us the teachings of his majesty. We don't want no devil's philosophy\\"<br /><br />You can always put your own interpretations and feelings into these songs , and my own conception of the sentence sung above may be different to that of most Marley devotees.<br /><br />But then that only go's to show the genius of Bob Marley, doesn't it?my own conception of the sentence sung above may be different to that of most Marley devotees.    But then that only go's to show the genius of Bob Marley, doesn't it?
B000ELIVB0|5.0|After cheesy pop \\"Deep Cuts\\" (that featured the hit \\"Heartbeats\\") I could never expect this from The Knife, this album is so different, so weird in a good way and Karin Dreijer Andersson?s voice is very thrilling, most of the times it?s doubled with octavesup and make their sound even odder...standouts are \\"captain\\", which starts like an average new age song and finishes with a beautiful chinese melody and \\"marble house\\" which will probably be their next single. Try to listen Royksopp?s \\"what else is there\\" featuring Karin...This is ABBA on acid. Brilliant!!

B0000026KQ|4.0|I really like this album, but I am not sure it is quite a 5 star classic.  Released in 1989, the CD is 39 minutes long and the sound quality is very good.    The great thing about Jeff Beck is that he is always experimenting and pushing the boundaries.  The difficult thing is that you never know what you are going to get with a Jeff  Beck CD.  You might love one of his styles and hate his others.  Many people who like Beck's pop music (especially the days he was with Rod Stewart) or his jazz fusion, hate this CD.    This is a trio of Beck, Terry Bozzio (from Frank Zappa and Missing Persons) and keyboardist Tony Hymas.  The music has a very hard and rough edge to it, but it isn't heavy metal or hard rock.      There are vocals on two tracks, but it isn't singing.  It is like a manic rap.  It is strange and very addictive.  It is similar to the ending of the Tube's What Do You Want From Life.    Like Beck's Rough and Ready and Blow By Blow, I find the music very atmospheric and absorbing.  It is the type than can transport you to a different reality where you completely lose yourself in the music.  Your head is spinning when the CD is over.    I can't quite give this 5 stars.  There are some sensational tracks, such as the \\"vocals\\" Guitar Shop and A Day in the House.  The tracks in the middle are also very stunning, getting the most of the keyboard and guitar interaction.   But, some tracks are just merely good.  Two Rivers is a just mundate New Age type jazz number.  Behind the Veil and Sling Shot are fusion type numbers that Beck has done much better in the past.      If you like this, you have to get Jeff Beck Live at BB King's.    If you want to try something along the same lines but a little more melodic but spacy, with longer compositions, check out Francis Monkman Jam.
0609610570|5.0|Introduction <br />-- <br />The authors of EXECUTION: THE DISCIPLINE OF GETTING THINGS DONE explicate the importance of execution in organizations.  Although I am reluctant to state it, I honestly consider this book a must-read for professionals determined to enhance the capabilities of their organizations.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />HIGHLIGHTS:   <br /> <br />-- <br />What is Execution? <br />-- <br />It is a discipline and a system, built into an organization's strategy, goals, and culture.  For execution to work, leaders must be deeply engaged in it.  Essentially, it is a specific set of behaviors and techniques that companies must master to develop a sustainable competitive advantage.  Ultimately, the authors state that strategies most often fail due to a lack of execution. <br /> <br /> <br />-- <br />How to Develop the Discpline and System of Execution? <br />-- <br />It requires a rigorious discussion of an organizaition, constant questioning (productive questioning), tenacious follow through, and organizational accountability.  To execute effectively, leaders must know their organization, the business environment, and be unafraid to confront reality.  An important feature of execution involves linking rewards with desirable outcomes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Building Blocks of Execution include: <br />(1)  LEADERSHIP <br />(a) realism  <br />(b) clear goals  <br />(c) rewards for the doers  <br />(d) expanding people's capabilities.   <br />(2)  ORG. CULTURE <br />(a) understand the software (beliefs and behaviors) of an organization as well as its hardware (strategy and structure) <br />(b) the organization must act to new thinking, not think itself to new actions <br />(c) provide rewards to performance <br />(d) help people master the desired behaviors  <br />(e) facilitate robust dialogue in the framework of openness and candor and informality.   <br />(3) THE RIGHT PEOPLE <br />(a) \\"many jobs are filled with the wrong people because the leaders whopromote them are comfortable with them\\" (p. 116). <br />(b) spending time on developing people will result in a payoff of a sustainable competitive advantage. <br />(c)  hire people determined to succeed, look at their backgrounds.  Have they glided along their lives?  <br />(d)  critical:  hire people with a drive to succeed, negating the education and pedigree of a person.   <br />(e)  when hiring, understand that some people interview well and others do not.  (Why do people not understand this?)  \\"A person who doesn't interview well may ... be the best choice\\" (p. 129). <br /> <br /> <br />-- <br />EXECUTING <br />-- <br />The processes of execution are strategy, people, and operations.   To execute, all must be linked. The book contains incredible depth on the processes of execution, and it is very difficult for me to adequately review them.  Although, say, 130 pages are devoted to the processes of execution, the content is extensive.  Two concepts I should note are simultaneity and synchronization in organizations.   <br /> <br /> <br />-- <br />A Model of Execution? <br />-- <br />Jack Welch, according to the authors, is the best example of a business leader who understood execution.  Jack Welch's heart and soul were immersed in GE, and he was engaged in the process of execution personally and deeply; he managed the three core processes (selecting leaders, setting direction, and conducting operations) effectively. <br /> <br /> <br />-- <br />Conclusion <br />-- <br />Execution is crucial in organization.  In fact, it is what separates the successful from the failures.  Everyone must understand what execution is and how to execute for an organization to fulfill its potential.   <br /> <br /> <br />I hope my review was helpful for you. <br /> <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Clovis
B000FFJYCU|4.0|I saw this movie when it was first released in Honolulu at the Cinerama theatre in the true Cinerama format. I remember nearly falling out of my seat as the astounding race sequences played out before me. This is a truly organic race film, there are real drivers of the F1 era mixed in with the mostly European cast, though James Garner and Eva Marie Saint break the cross Atlantic barrier. This film is a wonderful technical masterpiece. It even has some fine dramatic moments in between the melodrama. Some might say this is the film's greatest short coming. That is true, but also where it really mirrors the emotional high that F1 has always worn on it's sleeve. F1 is a soap opera that is played out across the world, where the wealthiest mingle, though not too closely, with the proletariat for a few hours of high rev mania. Many of the courses in the film are still in existance, but they have been smoothed out and plundered of passion. Often the races held these days resemble a parade, but once in a while things go terribly wrong and a race ensues. And it is in capturing those glorious moments that the film really soars. You will feel the ripping of the air as a car tears through the streets of Monaco, and be stunned by the speed and savagery of a huge racetrack like The Spa in Belgium or the amazing high banked corners at the old track in Monza, Italy. The camera work is a virtuoso masterpiece of technical achievement. Many of the shots that we take for granted today on our live TV races were the brain children of the camera men who worked on the film. This film is the one all of that work we see on modern TV broadcast racing strives to emulate. You are in the race, in the cockpit, in the mind and the heart of the greatest racers in the world. And for those who know the history of the sport, the real greats of the sport in that era are on hand. Jack Brabaham. Graham Hill. Jim Hill. Bruce McLaren. Richi Ginther. Many of the great names that are featured in this filmdid not survive the harshness of the sport and succumbed to death because of failure of both man and machine. This film is a treasure. It may be out dated. It may be melodramatic. It may also be the greatest racing film ever, but some debate that the much more restrained, almost catatonic Steve McQueen film, Le Mans is the superior. I see them as equals, representative of the two types of mind sets in racing. The passionate, fiery visrtuoso who crashes as much as he wins, and the technician, the cool headed pro, who always finishes, and manages to win more than a few in the process. Which is better? You see these movies and figure it out for yourselves. I have.
B0009WFF7M|5.0|I have owned \\"Brothers in Arms\\" since it was released in 1985, first on cassette and then on CD.  It has always been on my short list of music that comes out of my 800-plus discs to be played often.  For all of my enjoyment from this fine album over the years, it has been rendered obsolete after just a few minutes of hearing this 5.1 rendering playing through my home theater system.  The mastering is not just a faux 5.1, but a true experience that makes hearing the songs feel like it is the first time.  The rear speakers stay busy with short fills, the center speaker is pure vocal, making Knopfler's voice so clear and distinct, and when that thunder storm cracks on the title track, the sub lets you know it is really thunder, you can feel it.<br /><br />For the price, you can't get a better rendering of a great album.  In short, the 5.1 DVD is a perfect way to hear this music, but at a cost.  It will make it hard to enjoy basic left / right stereo recordings again.
B0000027RL|5.0|So Pearl Jam turned into a \\"politically correct\\" band who was \\"above\\" \\"prostitut{ing} its music on MTV?\\"  If our star reviewer had been paying attention (and apparently she wasn't), Pearl Jam got tired of politically correct companies such as Clear Channel charging concertgoers unreal amounts of money for concert tickets while pocketing the *huge* difference (a practice that continues unabated to this day).<br /><br />BUT back to the music ...<br /><br />For high schoolers today who watch VH1 and see these retro shows about the 1990's and keep hearing about \\"grunge\\" music and want to know more about it, the best place to start is with Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" (along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\").<br /><br />For me, this album embodies the spirit of grunge and the change taking place in the music industry in the early-1990's, where the heavy metal so-called \\"hair bands\\" were on their way out and grunge would dominate the charts for a few years (while every other kind of music would be right up there with it).<br /><br />I enjoy the vast majority of \\"Ten.\\"  I have this on cassette tape (anyone remember them?) and pop it into my Walkman and it gets me through the day with a smile on my face.  I love the melody of \\"Oceans\\" and the in-your-face jams of \\"Once\\" and \\"Even Flow.\\"  \\"Jeremy\\" is THE standard grunge theme.<br /><br />\\"Ten\\" is grunge at its best.  - Donna Di Giacomo
B00005JLD4|5.0|This film is the true story of Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi) and her sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) & cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan) as they escape a training camp in the year 1931.  The film, based off the novel of the same name written by real life daughter to Molly Craig, Doris Pilkington Garimara, chronicles their capture and escape in brutal detail and puts you in their shoes.  A little background info for you, in the years between 1905-1971 the white settlers in Australia enforced a law that allowed all half-caste children (that's half aboriginal and half white) to be taken from their homes and brought to camps where they would be assimilated into white society.  The purpose was to stamp out the race.  They wanted these children to mate with other white men, and their children to mate with whites and so on and so forth until any traces of aboriginal desendence would be gone.  Kenneth Branagh (who resembles Ewan McGregor) plays the enforcer and owner of all aboriginies (it's explained in the outset of the film) and thus he's the villian sort-a-speak.  After the girls are uprooted from their home and placed in the camp they decide to escape, and escape they do.  The rest of the film follows them as they trek for 9 months through the Australian desert, following the rabbit-proof fence, a 1,500-mile fence separating outback desert from the farmlands of Western Australia.  There journey is a heartwrenching, heartwarming story of their desire and need to be who they are.  What is so important about this film is that at times we only see racism in this country, which to be brutally honest is the [...] of too many jokes, and so to see how others were treated sheds light on the subject and hopefully will help others see a need, maybe even in our own homes.  It's crazy how we, as Americans, know of racism, know of slavery...we're taught it in schools and reminded of it everytime we see shows like 'Black/White' and at times it's shows like that that make racism seem more like a joke then a reality, but while watching this film my wife and I started talking and you really start to see what racism really is and that it is a serious problem.  To hear the men in this movie talk about their beliefs and how they feel they are helping these people by in an essence 'making' them white is horrible.  I mean, they really thought they were doing a good thing.  The courage these young girls showed was amazing.  The conclusion of this film is heartbreaking, but as the actual footage of these courages young girls (old women now) rolls onto the screen your touched because your reassured that these women are real and that there story is as well.  Brilliant story...something we should all see.
B000F5FNSE|3.0|The second that I saw this title I had to have it.  It was by far the best book that I read all summer.  Percy Jackson is one of those decent kids that can't catch a break.  He has managed to get expelled from every school he has attended, but things are looking up at his new school.  Is it because of the influence of his new Latin teacher?  Disaster strikes when he manages to blow up his math teacher.   <br /> <br />    As the story unfolds Percy learns that he is the son of a mortal woman and one of the gods from Ancient Greek Mythology.  As a result of his parentage there are a host of really scary and gross Greek Monsters determined to kill him.  Percy spends the remainder of the book facing, fighting, and fleeing from various monsters including Medusa.  With the assistance of two colorful friends, Annabeth (the daughter of Athena) and Grover (a nervous teenage satyr) Percy goes on a quest that could save both the gods and mankind.   <br /> <br />     The book is a wild roller-coaster ride of action that I really hated to see end.  Thankfully the sequel: Sea of Monsters delivers just as much interest and action.  Bring on the next book.
B0006L16N8|3.0|This album sounds nothing like the previous 2. If you're expecting to hear music that sounds similar to \\"yellow\\",\\"trouble\\",\\"the scientist\\",\\"in my place\\" and so on,this is not the one for you. You can't appreciate Chris Martin's voice on this album because it's not as outstanding as it was in the previous albums.  <br />There are a few tracks that are good;Speed of sound,The message,Fix you,Swallowed by the sea(personal favourite) <br />It's not a bad album,but just because this is coldplay,I know it could have been better.
