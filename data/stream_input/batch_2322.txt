B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is really amazing! I enjoyed the first book of the series and had to read the second one. This book is exciting, sad, and amazing all at the same time. It is truly perfect, however  if you are going o read this book make sure you have read the first one!! :)
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is amazing! My friends and I watch it all the time! It is fun and if you're in the mood for a good laugh, this is the right movie!
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|Hard to believe some of the acrobatics performed during the movie.  I've been to several Cirque Du Soleil shows and this movie depicts the experience well.  The whole experience was a pleasure.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved it. Wish I could read it again for the first time. Have recommended it to all my family and friends.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think its really fun. You can find diamonds every once in a while. After a long.time it feels always the same. Sometimes it is not boring because with new challenges it is awesome
B00BY9GQHM|1.0|What is the difference between this one and the original Letters from Nowhere because I think the only thing G5 is trying to do is get people to spend another 3 dollars on a game people already bought
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Especially enjoyed the author's decision to write it into the first person, it made the character real, and obviously, flawed, while showing his obsessive defense mechanisms.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved this whole series all the way up until the end. The ending did not fill in some of the loose holes that were placed throughout the series. I was disappointed that I had invested time reading the trilogy because the ending was very lacking. I felt the author got tired of writing and just made a quick attempt to finish.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|This a great movie, don't get me wrong, but if you're not completely enthralled with the Star Trek series, this may not be for you, because at times, this movie really drags.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|For a while, I have considered Persona 4 to be my favorite video game. I'm going to keep this relatively short, because I could spend hours and hours talking about why I love these games so much. I played through the game twice between December and January 2008/2009 and clocked in about 160-170 hours between my two files. I dabbled here and there since then, when I tried to beat the game's ultimate boss and just to beat the game again, but I haven't really touched the game since 2009.<br /><br />When I played through Persona 4: Golden, I kept thinking how the game was better than Persona 4. I love how the people who form the so-called \\"Persona Team\\" and everyone at Atlus keep improving on their games. Persona 3 was an amazing experience, but they easily outdid themselves with Persona 4, and did it again here.<br /><br />P4G is without a doubt in my mind better than P4. Persona 4 Golden is the definitive version of the game. This isn't just a port. It is a substantial expansion and improvement from an already flawless game.<br /><br />The additional gameplay options, from the motorcycle and gardening, to being able to select your Persona's skills while fusing to, new Social Links and a new dungeon make the game feel fresh for those who have played it before on the PS2. The game is extended from April to the end of December to April to the middle of February. The story is not only increased with extra days on the calendar, but with extra scenes, new events (like vacations and school events), the aforementioned new Social Links, new animated cutscenes, and an extended ending.<br /><br />One of the more welcome surprises for me are the social features of the game. Yes, Atlus managed to successfully turn Persona, a 60-80 hour game that you play all by yourself, into a more open and interactive game. There is a feature on the Vita which allows you to show what other players did on this day and time. For instance, you can see what other people did after school. You can seeif people found nothing interesting or if they interacting with a Social Link that doesn't appear too frequently, or one you haven't unlocked yet. You can see if people decided to study at night, or if they found somebody around town at night. There is also a neat dungeon rescuing mechanic integrated in with your solo dungeon crawling experience.<br /><br />Finally there are great bonus features built into the game. There are clips from the Persona concerts that were held in Japan a few years ago. You can play any animated cutscene from the story at any time. There are trailers for Persona 3, Persona 4, Persona 4 The Animation, and Persona 4 Arena. There are early character design sketches. You can play almost all of, if not every single song in the entire game.<br /><br />I do have one thing I didn't quite like about Persona 4 Golden, however. Some of the changes make the game easier, and at times too easy. (Now before I explain why, keep in mind this was my third time beating the game, I played through the game on normal, and there are two or three harder difficulties than normal. Anyway...) As an example, after a certain point in the game, Rise will assist your party when you perform an all out attack. This makes the attack even more powerful than it would normally be. Also, at random times a few party members will perform a unique attack. A pair of characters (ex. Chie and Yukiko, Naoto and Kanji) will run out and combine their powers to unleash a special attack, after an all out attack. So not only is the all out attack more powerful sometimes, you can get a bonus attack for free. Also, if you increase Rise's Social Link high enough, she will randomly help out your party, by healing everyone, or increasing your party's evasion, attack, or defense. Again, keep in mind this is my third time playing through the game, so I should have absolutely no trouble beating the game on normal. Still, at times it felt like the game added a few too many bonuses and assists that give you an advantage over your foes, yet the game doesn't do anything to raise the difficulty. The game has two or three \\"hard modes\\" and you can fine tune the difficulty in a New Game+, but I still think Atlus should look into more ways to keep the game challenging in the later stages when they eventually release Persona 5.<br /><br />But why are you even reading this review? You should know by now. The Persona series is awesome and the Vita is great. Just buy this game already and enjoy 60-100 hours of pure gaming bliss.

0345529057|5.0|The books are better than the show and I am enjoying them. However, the series is not complete and Martin doesn't seem overly eager to get the last two books done - which is a bit depressing.  Nevertheless, despite the fact I hate reading a series that is incomplete, it's worth it and possibly will reread the books when the next book comes out - that's how good it is.

I felt like I was on an adventurous treasure hunt following the surprising twists and turns of this story. I will miss the characters and almost feel like I really did know them. I'm going to run, not walk to find another Kate Morton book.

B00APJLEGA|4.0|We loved the movie. However, if you have a preschooler that is mimicking things, the little old lady gremlin that  eats thing and says 'I didn't do that' is a favorite trick of my daughter and nieces. I was disappointed that the digital didn't have the subtitle option.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My kid and I love this movie. Also we can watch it any where with the kindle. Perfect for road trips.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I'd seen this movie many years ago, but I bought it because of the song \\"Matilda\\" on alt-J's May 2012 CD release called \\"An Awesome Wave\\" [[ASIN:B008OW1S3O An Awesome Wave]] I love the way this movie portrays the gradual building of a tender relationship between Jean Reno (Leone \\"L&eacute;on\\" Montana) and Natalie Portman (Mathilda Lando), and they do it without ever venturing into pedophilia, even though the character Mathilda tries to go there because she is bored and seems to want to push L&eacute;on in that direction, where he absolutely refuses to go!<br /><br />I have always loved Gary Oldman, who plays Norman Stansfield, the corrupt DEA Agent; I think he is one of the most versatile actors ever, and he always gives 110 percent to every role that he plays. The line that this movie and the alt-J song have in common is, \\"This is from Mathilda\\" (spelled Matilda in the song), when Jean Reno hands Gary Oldman the pin from one of the several grenades strapped to his chest. What a great scene! I think that Gary Oldman's character utters the very same expletive, when he realizes that he is about to be blown to bits, as he does in [[ASIN:B000QTD368 The Fifth Element (Remastered) [Blu-ray]]] \\"The Fifth Element\\": OH S***!!! Great film!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great game and lots of fun.  Only draw back was the adds but it was free. Worked well on the kindle.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|A friend of mine who owns a CD store in Italy(rare as hen's teeth these days) turned me on to \\"Taro\\" from alt-J's 25 May, 2012 release, An Awesome Wave[[ASIN:B008OW1S3O An Awesome Wave]]. I still don't know precisely what it is about the song Taro that affects me so much, but I get very emotional when I hear it, especially when bassist/guitarist Gwil Sainsbury creates that eerie percussive sound on the chorus toward the end, as he taps the fret board of his guitar with what looks like the outer plastic cover of a roll of surgical tape!<br /><br />The sounds on this whole album can be very subtle and are very creative, which causes me to listen very closely, which is a very rewarding endeavor. The very first time that I heard Joe Newman's voice, my reaction was, \\"Is he squeezing his voice box to create or affect that sharp sound, or is that really his natural voice?\\" I'm still not sure about that. But he sings in what would seem to be the very bottom of his falsetto voice range, and it sounds very different than what one is used to hearing from a singer. Yet I think that for just this reason, his voice conveys or expresses so much emotion, and elicits an emotional response from the listener, at least from this listener. As a singer myself, I sometimes cringe as he teeters on the verge of going off-key by using this vocal technique, and indeed he does stray a little off key on the 'hidden track' after Taro, called 'Hand Made', which if I were to be critical comes very close to the sound of baying hound dogs (sorry Joe and Gus!). Because of the soft way that Joe Newman and keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton sings, I would suspect that they need very good vocal monitors when they perform live. I have heard some performances online, in Amsterdam for instance, where it was obvious that Joe Newman could not hear himself very well, and I was embarrassed for him.<br /><br />I also love the unique sounds and beats that percussionist Thom Green creates, without a cymbal in site! All of the sounds and textures that alt-J create together make them one of the most interesting and unique group of musicians that I have ever heard, and their delivery can be an emotional experience, IMHO. This album is well worth stopping whatever you are doing to give it your full attention.ll of the sounds and textures that alt-J create together make them one of the most interesting and unique group of musicians that I have ever heard, and their delivery can be an emotional experience, IMHO.

B00002N9ER|1.0|These always brake when you try to slide a Mag Light into place.  I called the manufacture and they wouldn't help, nor replace.  I would not recommend.
B00AEFYCL4|1.0|This was a complete waste of 2 1/2 hours of my time.  I'm still wondering why people think what this kid did warranted his elevation to hero status in the movie (and apparently in the book, as well, although I have never read it nor do I intend to do so).  A journey of self discovery?  Yes, perhaps.  My intepretation?  An incredibly selfish and privileged--and very possibly mentally ill--young man chose to turn his back on his family and start a journey for which he was woefully unprepared.  For much of the movie, he talks about going to Alaska, but when he gets there, he basically has a sleeping bag and a 10-pound bag of rice.  Seriously?  To venture into the wilds of Alaska?  He supposedly graduated with honors from Emory University.  And he spent two years working toward getting to Alaska only to arrive with nothing he needs to survive?  Totally stupid or mentally incapable of making such a decision, you decide for yourself if you choose to watch the movie.<br /><br />Before you decide to watch this movie, I would suggest reading about the true story (not the book). And then decide if you want to spend 2 1/2 hours watching a movie that totally discounts much of that truth.<br /><br />While I feel for his family and the pain they have experienced, he did nothing that should have been made into a movie unless you think turning your back on your family and starting a slow journey towards your death is great movie material.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I regret I took my time to watch it.
B00005AVWB|5.0|Made in 1959, this courtroom drama is about a rape case and Otto Preminger knew how to push all the right buttons. Jimmy Stewart, a young Lee Remick, Eve Arden, George C. Scott & Duke Ellington! Need I say more? One of the best movies ever made & one of my favorites.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Costumes and Set Design are amazing - you would think it was filmed back in the day.  The actors are wonderful.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This is the CD direct from the movie. Excellant, there is no other way to describe it. If you loved the movie you will love the soudtrack. The raw emotion of the actors is still there, it is not a studio version. You can feel the pain and strife, you can sense the love and admiration this version lives up to the hype.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The concept and early parts of this game are a lot of fun, after all who doesn't want to create their own Jurassic Park? But once you level up into the upper teens the game becomes a laggy, unresponsive mess. Something as simple as collecting money takes twice as long as it should due to the game not responding to your taps, and good luck trying to complete the Code Red minigame, you'll be lucky to get it to recognize you tapped on anything let alone continue it for a minute.plus.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|EPIC, that is really all i have to say. This movie is epic, for the first time hollywood got it right, it is about the story, not the effects. Cineomatically one of the best films i have ever seen. Sticks to the book and broadway adaptation. The actors and actresses nailed it. Best work they have ever done. I cannot stand Russell Crowe personally and yet i loved him in this movie, excellant portrayal of Javert. Masterful. Hugh Jackman is so believable as Val Jean and Eponines portrayal will tear your heart out, she plays it so well you almost wish Marius would love Eponine instead. EPIC EPIC EPIC, there is no other word for it
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Adam is a very good lead male vocalist. The writing is excellent. Daylight is my favorite song followed  by Telephone and Moves Like Jagger, Great CD!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The series will keep you on the edge of your sword.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone who likes to read.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|Shawshank is our all time favorite movie.  The story is moving, the acting is superb, and you just melt listening to Morgan Freeman's narrative.  We introduced our teen girls to this great movie and they loved it; got all the nuances and now the 16 yr old wants to read the book.  Brilliant movie; great family time.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Completely misleading title.  Should be called, &#34;gratuitous violence and glorification of drug use...all in slow motion&#34;!  The original version was not a lot better, but at least it was watchable.  Don't waste your time...  I turned it off.

B0058RCVYS|5.0|&#34;I love it&#34;??<br />No.<br />It's a very good movie, with deep insights into the characters.<br />What I do not like (or understand) is why a brief sentence suggesting the content of a film is absent from the listings.<br />This would be a fine addition to the Amazon film lists. Take another look at how Netflix offers a capsule look at the films<br />it lists. To check out an Amazon film listing, one has to almost sign on to play the movie before making a judgement or comparing films before making a final choice. WAKE UP, AMAZON.
B0076NAVNA|4.0|As a new super group I have would expected a little bit more of composition.  It reminds me a lot of SMPTe but more Pop.  A couple of songs are master pieces of inspiration.  Hope next album becomes a little more musically technical
B000YJ54DU|5.0|#12 in the REACHER series is great -- this  actually completes the entire REACHER series for me.  I started just at the end of 2010 and now with NOTHING TO LOSE I am completely up to date with the series.  NOTHING TO LOSE has everything you want out of a Jack Reacher story -- a good and believable beginning,  settings that are familiar to most, twists and turns,  good action, a little romance, and most of all a good story.  AND I love the way, you get some additional info after the story climax.  G.McPherson Brown

B009JZWO3I|5.0|That's hard to do in a fourth season. This one is smartly written and acted. I'm a lawyer and I find it pretty realistic (except for how short their time is between landing the client and going to trial, but it's an episodic show). If you haven' watched from the beginning, go back and do so.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Good action movie. Great camera Angles. Actors were cast real well for the parts it sure di not disappoint at all.
1451638450|5.0|Just so reviewers know, I love Bujold's Barrayar books to begin with, so I went into this expecting to be enchanted -- and was!<br /><br />Our hero this time out is Ivan Vorpatril, who has been a very nicely developed character through the series, but not one that we're as familiar with as we are with his cousin Miles. It was a refreshing change, even if it does seem to be a one-off story, sadly. Ivan's girl-chasing ways have been well-documented in the series, as has been his lack of desire to reach higher professionally, and those traits are played against well in this story. Ivan finds himself in a situation that changes his life, and forces him to make choices he probably wouldn't rather make. It's a great story from beginning to end, a wonderful tale of romance, politics, revenge, honor and duty. The characters are deep, the story pure fun. And Bujold also makes sure that there are lots of cameos from other characters that series readers have come to know and love, of course.<br /><br />My only thought is that readers who aren't familiar with the Barrayar books probably won't get as much entertainment from the story. I would recommend starting with the first book in the series, and would definitely recommend reading the series, but even without reading everything that has gone before, Bujold does a really good job explaining the world she's creative and I think that the book would be a good read without the multi-book background. Just not AS good.<br /><br />I loved the book, and can't wait to see what Bujold has in store for us next!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love this book this is the second time I'm ready this book<br />I will probably read this book again
B004XKVPG6|5.0|Morgan Freeman as the veteran cop and Brad Pitt as the rookie are outstanding as the lead actors. They are backed by Gweneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, who make major contributions. I am impressed by the high ratings for this film, which I agree with. I will not spoil the film for new viewers by explaining what Se7en stands for: you will discover that in the first part of the film.<br />I recently reviewed the David Fincher film The Game. That film takes place in San Francisco, but the closing credits of the film disclose that some of the scenes of the movie were filmed in Los Angeles.<br />In Se7en I am guessing that the first part of the film was filmed in Chicago, which has the El or elevated railway (see The Fugitive by Andrew Davis and starring Harrison Ford, which was filmed in Chicago). The shaking in Brad and Gweneth's apartment when the train goes by points to Chicago. The closing scenes of the film showing the power lines in the desert point to LA, which makes sense if the final cut of the film occurs where the major film studios are located. What do you think?

B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I thought this movie would never end.  It's not like there was going to be a surprise ending or anything and it just went on and on.  I thought the acting was good though.  I would have preferred to see more of the interactions between Abe and his wife.  Of course, that would have required a lot of conjecture, but that's what Speilberg is good at and that's what the movies are all about.
B004ZJZPWA|5.0|Very nice movie for entertainment.  Hugh Jackman in his prime of course, but also captures the Steampunk feel for the late 19th, early 20th century.  Has the victorian setting of evil monsters versus good characters and of course the antique looking, yet fantastic inventions of that era.  In this case it's Van Helsing's crossbow.<br /><br />A plot driven adventure to be sure, so don't spend time looking for some deep character arc. It captures the essence of the old Monster movies of the 30's but adds high definition and special effects.  Great movie to sit around with a few friends, popcorn and drinks and cut up after the tense scenes.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I enjoyed the pacing of this game, but after a while, the levels began to be a little repetitive, and most of the power-ups were not especially useful. Still a very fun game overall.

B008DYZKQE|2.0|Thin characters, language and plot. Princess saves a Prince from a dragon. The Prince is ungrateful and shallow. She calls him a bum. The end.<br /><br />The tag line above is what my daughter said right after finishing it.
B00AHDXTIK|3.0|Most people wouldn't complain if a cable was too thick and heavy, but here's my gripe.<br /><br />I have the wall outlet less than 2-feet away from where this is being used on a new iPad. Because the cord is so heavy, it causes the shielding to twist and become (what appears to be) fragile.
B00A8LYYI0|4.0|This movie had very good and well used 3d. It moves along at a faster pace then the first which is very good. has a few little nods to the games.  Its just a fun little 90 min ride.  There are pretty much no featurs at all which is annoying considering that the UK got a few.  If you like fun 3d with some pop this movie is for you. If you are looking for a deep movie with a mind numbing story that makes you feel like your smart this is not for you at all.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a great game it goes on forever is addicting and fun<br />It's simple design but good graphics. With a timer and the race environment always changing it makes it addicting
B006MW3V6U|5.0|can't stop thinking about Downton Abbey.  I love all of the characters.  The story line is just beautiful.  Can't wait for the next season.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|A perfect blend of laugh and sadness, a well-written plot, so definitely five stars. Personally, I was intrigued by the book because I wanted to feel how terribly hard life can be in these teenagers' lives. I wish Gus hadn't died, but that reminds me that this story can tell a lot about how life actually is for some people. Eventually, what makes this book amazing is this: love is what saves the characters from dying without being remembered. Well done John Green.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|that is just it.  I really don't have very much to say about this little saga.  It is just ok.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Couldn't stop watching!! Great storylines. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are amazing actors!!!! Can't wait to finish Season 2! HIghly recoommend

B007SXB498|1.0|I enjoyed Pride & Prejudice but I had seen the movie. I could not follow the characters in this book at all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so much fun! everyone should play this game! have a grate day. and God bless love Jackie.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|when ever i tryed to open this app all the screen was black and then it asked if i wanted to send a email to the makers.this game does not work 4 kindle fires.<br />also i just removed the app from my device because its not worth it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was very crazy at times but it was a cute read.  I hope I never ever wake up married.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand By Me is a Coming of Age story that is based on a real event from Stephen King's childhood.  It starts on the last weekend of summer vacation before the boys head to Junior High School.<br /><br />The boys have inside knowledge of the location of a missing kid.  They decide that they will become heroes if they walk to the place and report the body.  The walk turns out to be a very long one, and there are several adventures involving a watchdog, a treacherous shopkeeper, a rival gang of older toughs, and a quick moving train.  When they find the body, they also discover that each of them have passed out of childhood and into the world of an apprentice adulthood.<br /><br />The movie is not as good as the book (but it isn't that far behind).
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I load it and it worked fine for 2 days and was starting to like it BUT Now every time i try to load it is just shuts down!!!!<br />so now i have a just have a icon
B004UID2LC|3.0|had down load this one for some reason the old app stopped working<br /><br />this one works ok but seem diferent to work with ?
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great series, and you have to love the references of towns and cities in Massachusetts.<br /><br />The acting is great and the storyline is not campy.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I never watch the show that helped start her career. I simply love the wonderful songs and her amazing talent. Kelly Clarkson ROCKS!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Good story which was fun to watch. Very good special effects. Movie close to the books story. Good movie for all the family.
B00011KHTM|5.0|The product arrived quickly and in good condition.  I use the adapter to connect my 13&#34; Macbook to an external monitor/projector.  This adapter works great and stays in place better than other brands.  I tried third-party adapters which seemed to work well at first, then began to either stop working altogether or would show only one color (such as all blue or pink) on the screen after only a few days.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Print was too small, but got ereader and downloaded it. Finished it in no time at all<br />Well worth the read. Well written, you could nearly see the characters it was so well explained
0553805371|5.0|While this was challenging for me to digest, I really appreciated Hawking's work and recommend it to anyone interested in our marvelous universe.  I read it twice--so far.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game  is cool. I have had NO troubles. I have full grown hammer head without buying any coins or gems... Great white here I come. I would pay for this game but I'm glad it's free.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This is my second cover and I love it!  It allows the buttons; stylus and charger easy accesss.  The strap to secure closing is great!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|so it's excellent however I did prefer Season 1 & 2 better.  I don't mind the gore of Season 3 just a few of the episodes were kind of long and drawn out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really fun and realistic. It is like taking care of an actual horse. I would recommend this to girls between the ages of 6 and 11
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is just as wonderful as season 1. What a fantastic series! Loved the stories, character development, and dialog. These are the strengths of a great story; not the foul language and gratuitous sex that most other series rely on! I have no negative comments other than be careful, once you start the series you won't want to stop.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was recommended to me by family, and boy, am I sure glad I read it!  Luttrell's detailed accounting of his SEAL training in Coronado, CA, through the terrible battle to his final rescue really made his story come alive.  I also gained a new appreciation for the hard work and abilities of the soldiers who complete this intense training all so they can serve and protect our country. Going wherever and doing whatever is asked of them, no questions asked.  My heart goes out to the families of the men who were lost in this battle.  Frankly, I found this book so compelling and inspiring that I am having my 13 year old son read it. Yes, there are some swear words in the book but given the context I personally don't have a problem with my son reading it. And for those with the harsh words about Luttrell expressing his opinions?  Get over it.  I am sure we would all have strong opinions after going through what he did.  I actually appreciated reading his opinions - they are part of what made the story &#34;his&#34; and not some recount by a random journalist.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book.  I couldn't put it down and when it was over, I was sad.  I recommend!
B0091LS07E|5.0|We purchased this CD for a family member....they really love it and listen to it frequently.  Alicia has a great voice and is very easy to listen to.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|The book started out promising and I was interested in reading about sub conscience decision making but the book became more about people who used the decision making process than the process itself.  About a third of the way in I lost interest.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Great movie and no problems streaming the video. I have DSL and it was sufficient. I can not believe I was so interested in that
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This is a great way to get the day started. A one stop show for news and other great information!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thought the second book was better. I still enjoyed the final book but felt that t this book dragged whereas the others kept my attention.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|A well written novel that forces you to pay attention to the details!  I had the chance to read this while I was on a train! Fun!!
B008VBYN80|4.0|It is a very entertaining game, but not to perfect for kids under 5. Its much to complicated. And loading takes WAY to long! But over all, the game is a perfect way to pass time. But the BEST part is that you get to fight with other Kingdoms!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I brought my Kindle Fire w/me to Panama, and this MicroShell Folio Case Cover was just the protction I had hoped for.  I would recommend it to all.  My daughter recommended it.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|good book up to the end.  really left you hanging, but just ok.  this was reccommended to me but i was very disappointed in it.
0439023491|3.0|Well, I went into this book with false beliefs. I figured, it's over. Nothing bad is going to happen now, so this is going to be kind of dry and boring. Not what happened at all. After all of the drama created in the first book, I really shouldn't have been surprised at the way things went in this second book. There was shock and awe, romance and adventure. So many different things that no one could possibly have seen coming. Overall, this was a really good read and I could not wait to get to the third book.
B00BGI07GC|5.0|Horribly addicting in the best way possible...I love this show! I wasn't to sure about it at first...knowing only Kevin Bacon and Shawn Ashmore but once I got into it, there was no going back!! It really does have \\"on the edge of your seat\\" drama and awesome acting by of course Kevin and Shawn but also Nico Tortorella, Adan Canto and James Purefoy. Very gripping...you never know what is going to happen next...and believe me..you want to know! Amazing show and I highly recommend it!
0439023513|2.0|Well, if you have not read the previous books, I am sorry to say there are going to be spoilers here. Yep, you read the above blurb right. They were sucked back into the games again. No one ever knew it was possible. And they survived. You quickly learn that some suspicions are true and that some of the things that you least expect really can happen.<br /><br />I did, however, find the ending a little disappointing in that there could have been so much more that was developed there, but the words that were on the pages seemed to barely scratch the surface. It felt too open ended and too shallow, too little left unsaid. I felt as though, to truly understand the story, I just needed to know more. I wanted more. I expected more. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but I felt like it lacked some kind of depth. The beginning was full of excitement and action and drama, and the end just fell flat for me.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|can play against ur friends..continuous game...always different..yet can only pick from selected choices. would love to be able to pick ur own things to draw.<br />great app..definetely recommend for all ages
0439023521|5.0|I admit, I picked this up and read this because I wanted to see what all of the hype was about. Everyone I know was talking about or reading this, or had seen the movie. I am funny. I will not see a movie if I have not read the book that goes with it, so I hadn't seen it yet. I have been getting some nudging from a friend, so figured I should read the book and see what it was all about.<br /><br />In the beginning, Katniss seemed kind of fickle to me, in terms of response to male attention. She has this guy right in front of her, and yet it is almost like she does not even see him. When I was a teenager, I would have killed for a boy to have been that attentive to me.<br /><br />I imagine Gale to be this handsome, tall young man who one would just melt into.<br /><br />When you get into the meat of the story, you start to see the dynamic of the characters and who they really are, but it takes a little while to get there. There is a degree of frustration in reading, because the writing is somewhat juvenile, but entirely too graphic for some YA readers in their earlier teens.<br /><br />The compassion Katniss is shown after she steps up after the horrific feeling when her sister's name is called is amazing, though. I mean, you never expect to hear them call Prim, because her name was only in there once. It just does not seem possible. But it happens, and it is there, in black and white, and I was shocked, horrified. All of the same emotions I imagine Katniss was feeling.<br /><br />But then you meet Peeta, who you instantly fall in love with, and find yourself tuning the pages just to see what is going to happen.<br /><br />Overall, the story was enjoyable and suspenseful, if a bit horrifying. I would recommend this book highly to older teens and adults (16-17+). I think some younger readers or some who are more sensitive might have a hard time with the level of violence in this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great app!! if u love temple run its the same idea.i love the graphics on this one better. its very addictive!!! definetely recommend it
1439153663|5.0|I just finished The Kitchen House and I would rate it among the best books I have read in my lifetime.  I felt such a connection to Lavinia and Belle that I hated to see the book come to an end.  I sincerely hope that Kathleen Grissom will write more books, however, I understand that writing this book had to have taken a lot out of her and it might be difficult to summon that kind of energy for more books.  If she writes them, I will read them!
B000NY12CI|5.0|This was an inciteful and riveting true story of growing up as a Somalian woman.  Don’t ask, just read it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|My son told me to buy this movie for him, it seems that all the kids in the school like it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I quite enjoyed this read despite all the negative reviews.  It's not quite as repetitive as they all make it out to be.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|this book is so good its not like tjose cheesy love stories where they immediatly fall in lov with each other no its the opposite it literally takes u through all the emotions one minute ur laghing like crazy and the next ur clutching a box of tissues its a relly good book that i enjoyed and u should totally read it!!! i only like entertaining books and if i dont like it it takes me forever to finish but with this book i finished it in one night it was that good like i kept trying to find a good plac to stop but there wasnt any place to stop each sentence just made you want to read more!
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|While the Walking Dead sometimes drags or might be a bit inconsistent, which is in almost all cases enough to earn a show an automatic 4, or even 3 1/2 star rating, at it's best the show is incredible. Thought-provoking, intense, tearful, joyful, scary, fast paced, unpredictable. Incredible enough to overcome any occasional blemish. TV rarely has little more than a minor impact on me. Usually it's just background noise or a simple way to pass the time. This is one of very, very few shows over the years that has me invested in the story and characters. Aside from WD, \\"can't wait for the next episode\\" really isn't part of my vocabulary.
B00992CF6W|3.0|it will not downlodad at all I have minecraft but it wont let me download this app I'm so mad
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is one book I have recommended to everyone I talk to. It seems so simple but it gives you an understanding of others that can be applied to all areas of your life but especially to your marriage.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game has poor resolution and it exhibits a limited story-line format compared to apple's version. I wouldn't buy it again.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|An absorbing, heartwarming read from beginning to end.  I absolutely loved it. You will be so pleased that you chose this book.
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|Martin Cruz Smith introduces us to Arkady Renko in what is to become the first of a thrilling saga of crime, political corruption, depression and death. But fantastic twists in the plot keep coming at you and the somber backdrop of Russia is shown in a subtle, almost endearing light. How does Renko cope with his decaying Russian environment? He's smart, he's lucky but he also has a dark sense of humor. He loves Irina the way he lives and works, with desperation. But he manages - against the specific instructions of the KGB and the militia to turn every stone and gradually allow truth to seep through.<br /><br />In the process, he destroys the finances and political careers of his bosses and finds a love so intense and so beautifully described by MCS that the reader becomes emotionally involved too.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|Let me start off by saying Batman is my all-time favorite superhero but this movie was a pretty big letdown.<br /><br />The movie begins 8 years after The Dark Knight and we find out that Batman has quit being Batman and now he's just limping around and sulking in his mansion. I didn't think they'd choose to go this route with a third movie but they did. The problem here is that as an audience member you want to see Batman right away and you want this movie to get rolling. It doesn't. They have to completely rebuild the character of Batman all over again. This takes 45 minutes. That is almost the same amount of time it took to build Batman up in Batman Begins. It was fine for that movie because it is an origin story and you are expecting it to be more about character development and not so heavy on loads of action. Finally after about 45 mins Batman does indeed finally show up and the movie does begin to get better and within 25 minutes of Batman being back you get to, in my opinion, the best fight in any Batman movie Batman vs. Bane The ending to this scene is very faithful to the comics and I would normally be ecstatic about this, but it means unfortunately that Batman is going to be gone for another 50 minutes!. I wouldn't have a problem with this if I didn't have to wait the first 45 minutes before being able to see Batman but this is getting ridiculous. Its become a Batman movie without Batman.<br /><br />During the second half of the movie it highly focuses on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Blake while Batman is gone yet again and the whole entire movie just slows down to a crawl. This is mainly due to Christopher Nolan's severe pacing issues which are present in all of his movies.<br />And when finally when Batman makes his reappearance near the end of the movie I feel pretty exhausted due to Nolan's bad pacing and I just want the movie to be over with. You do get another Batman/Bane fight and you find out I guess why they felt the need to make the character of Blake as large as they did. But in making his character who he is it was just a slap in the face to every Batman fan out there.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|It´s a great movie from the mid 80´s. I enjoyed everything, especially the music and fashion from that time. I highly recommend it.
0007229739|5.0|Great science fiction.  Couldn't get enough of it.  Creative story and interesting characters.  Don't want to ruin the story...saying that it's a science fiction is more than you need to know.  Go for it.
0756405890|5.0|This is my first book review, possibly because I've never been motivated enough, until now. With my unbridled penchant for fantasy and sci-fi, I've been steadily working through the Hugo award winners, but was running out of appealing options, and randomly came across Patrick's name in a plain-old google search for 'best fantasy novels of the 21st century'. So I thought I'd give 'Name of the Wind' a go. And I am SO glad I did.<br /><br />I love the fantasy genre for its imagination, its escapism, and its license to happily tear down the rules of standard reality and replace them with fascinating new ideas and constructs. However, I find it depressingly populated by a multitude of cookie-cutter swords & sorcery novels that appear to have originated in a lonely 14 year-old's bedroom. I often find fantasy to be annoyingly immature, excessively romantic, sickeningly florid, and very often formulaic and predictable.<br /><br />The Kingkiller series, however, is a breath of much-needed fresh air.<br /><br />It's intelligent, unpretentious, mature, insightful, funny, perfectly-paced, and above all, doesn't make you feel like you're being read to by a patronising teenager who thinks he's the reincarnation of some 12th-century warlock.<br /><br />Patrick's writing is refreshingly efficient - he doesn't wander aimlessly around a sentence like he's inspecting a rose garden - he delivers content using (seemingly) exactly the right words, getting his meaning across without any unnecessary embellishments, or flowery language. That's not to say that he can't wax lyrical when the need arises - his songs are elegant, polished and witty, and his Inception-like nested stories are also beautifully written. But he doesn't waste words, and doesn't add superfluous adjectives merely for the sake of adding adjectives. It's writing at the level you expect and deserve - it's like meeting a kindred soul who knows exactly how to talk to you.<br /><br />His characters are real, visceral, complex, and eminently likeable (where appropriate). Our main 'protagonist' (I hate that word) is revealed and developed with just the right amount of depth, complexity and duality to be truly engaging and familiar. He also constantly surprises and inspires with his annoyingly elegant (and obvious, but only in hindsight) methods for dealing with adversaries and tricky situations.<br /><br />The esoteric aspects are cleverly thought out, and never make you feel like you're indulging in a ridiculous flight of fancy. The concept of 'Names' seems to strike a familiar, ancient chord, but not one that's been previously heard in another book - it's reminiscent of existing Terran mythology, and feels like something that should really exist, if it doesn't already - at the same time as endowing the characters with all sorts of delightful and awesome powers.<br /><br />There is also a goldmine of wisdom in these books. So many storylines pan out in a way that made me take pause and think 'I should apply this sort of thinking to my own life'. It's like being subtly educated without your knowledge. I do actually feel that I approach my life slightly differently as a result of reading them. 'What would Kvothe do?' (- usually not what I'm actually doing).<br /><br />All in all, the Kingkiller series is fantasy exactly how I like it - deep, unpretentious, clever, and maddeningly immersive. I've rarely been so disappointed to finish a book, but so happy to have had it in my life. Possibly not since LoTR, in fact.<br /><br />Pure gold, all the stars.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you have this figured out, believe me you don't.  It was an exciting book but I really was disappointed at the end of it.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Although a bit pedantic at the start once the author settles into her own prose it really picks up. She is a master of her craft and a voice to be heard. Congratulations!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Saw it in 3D and it's great. Got this DVD right away and of course not 3D but should be good
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is a must for any Matrix enthusiast. It has all the extras and the anamatrix films that tie the whole series together.  Well worth the money.  I bought if for my husband for his birthday and he loves it.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|We liked this movie. It was good, but a little bit longer than it needed to be. There was a lot of action.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|A clever and sometimes frustrating game!  You will love it, but it will drive you crazy sometimes!  Very unique, very well made.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|It  is  one  of  my  favorites.  The  singing,  duets  and  musical  background  are  wonderful.  I  would  recommend  it  highly.  Great.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Lots of fun!<br />Challenging and a great way to pass some time while waiting for an appointment or when picking up children from an activity or school.<br />Keeps the mind moving.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Great show. Love this collection with all the extras. Just the SNL sketch included was worth buying this but also to have it forever!!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This movie was a funny twist on the real Pride and Prejudice. The characters were well played by the chosen cast. Scenery and props beautiful. Apart from a couple of off color statements in the movie it was fun. And the most wonderful part, the love story between Darcy and Amanda.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched Downton Abbey season 1 elsewhere. It was so good, I had to find the rest of the series. It is outstanding!! Very good dialogue, costumes, story line, character development, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I then purchased Season 3...
B0000AKCLS|5.0|One of the better Joe Bonamassa albums I've enjoyed. I've been getting Joe's music for awhile now mostly listening in the shop or in the truck. It's not unusual to be turning up the volume with this one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am enjoying mystery manner. When there was a popup about getting 10 diamonds if you ordered the tribes. I ordered , downloaded and am playing the game. I have not gotten them yet. Please check what the problem is.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this beautiful story, it has a silver lining.  Can't wait to see the movie.  It made me laugh and cry and those are the best stories.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I thought the movie was very good, everything I expected it to be, The scenery in the movie was beautiful the characters were brave, heroic and funny and determined to complete the journey. I think this movie is worth the time and effort to see with your family.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great, it's addictive and it's cool that you get chased by A giant monkey! I love it and the graghics!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a pretty cool game. It can get addictive especially if you try to see how fast you can get through the stages.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|This movie was poorly made: the acting is unnatural and unconvincing and the<br />whole movie was very very very cheesy.
B00AVF8USS|1.0|this movie shows up under 3D MOVIES OFFERED!!!!!!!! However when you are FORCED to purchase the movie..(because for some reason you are not allowed to rent), it is availble in HD or normal with out any indication that IT IS NOT 3D.  NOW, I am sitting here looking at 3 very ANGRY little girls who would gladly scratch my eyes to the point of me perminatley needing to wear3D glasses just to see, if giving the chance.....Other then that, its GREAT!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This really is more than I thought it would be. It is great for letting you know your battery is low and how much time you have left.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|The movie is interesting - even to adults. My 10 year old grandson didn't want to watch it (it was chosen by his brother), but ended up enthralled.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Awesome movie. Amazing talent and effects. My son is astounded by the tricks and the contortionists. Haha! A must see, I expected a Cirque De Soleil show that is what I got. This movie delivered very well.
B00985E3UG|5.0|If you are looking for a polemic ranting against the food manufacturing giants, go look some place else.  What you will find here is one of the more readable and well reasoned investigative works of journalism I've ever read.  Everything Moss writes is documented yet in an engaging minimally academic style.  Be careful for you may find yourself becoming furious with the food giants.  You must remember, however, they are only giving people what the people want.  Still, it is hard not to view the food giant manufacturers as giant drug dealers after reading this book.  Also, I will never view coke commercials again with innocence and naivete.  Read the book and you'll understand.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Excellent recording!  His talent and the choice of pieces make this a prize possession for me.  I will be buying more of Lang Lang.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|No rating because it wouldn't download.  Might have been a problem with my phone but tried several times to no avail.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you are a fan of The Moody Blues and especially Justin then you will love this CD. I just saw The Moody Blues a couple of weeks ago and Justin sounded better than ever. This disc really shows off his vocals. He is an amazing singer. A couple of the songs are redone from previous recordings. Great mellow music.
B000001FKY|5.0|Like Pyromania, This contains music that was meant to fill sports stadiums. Numerous masterpieces are included. It's a piviotal part of my limited collection of masterpieces from the 1950's to the present.
030758836X|3.0|Very cleverly constructed. Slowly drew me in deeper, and I was enjoying the trip. But then...<br /><br />...the ending! So disappointed. Didn't ruin the experience entirely, still worth reading. But frustrating. So close yet so far!<br /><br />Anyways, the truly interesting interplay here is the question: how well do you know your spouse? Very intriguing. That alone is a fun question to consider in the context of this book. Unless you reach some unpleasant conclusions! Maybe, in the end, we ARE all alone...  :)<br /><br />Erik Conrad Randall

B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Great continuation of the family saga--Fraser and McKenzie--and the beginning of a new generation with the union of Roger McKenzie and Brianna Fraser and the birth of their little boy.<br />Much of this book takes place in the New World and specifically the family's settlement in North Carolina. Will Brianna and Roger attempt to return to 1970s Scotland and Boston or will they remain in 1770s North Carolina?<br />I'm eager to find out the answer to that question in book 4.<br />Great suspense was created in this book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great illustrations and fun to play. Entertaining and just challenging enough to keep you interested to buy the full version.<br />Awesome game once again from g5!
B001EC2IV2|4.0|I watched this movie after reading positive reviews and was not disappointed. Besides the main characters I also enjoyed Robert Pastorelli's performance (he played Huey, the other writer in the movie Michael). There was a lot of violence in this movie. One reviewer suggested it as a movie that can be watched with kids. Well, someone puts a gun in his mouth and blows his head away. That is not something I would show kids. And there are plenty of other very violent events in the movie. Aside from that, even though it was made in 1996, its special effects are still inspiring and there are some surprises and comic moments. And Arnold is very Arnold.

B00BHU2A7I|1.0|Anthony Hopkins excells in almost everything that he does.  But, he just didn't translate as Hitchcock.  A naturally fat man was needed for this roll.  Hitchcock's mannerisms were so distinct;  I think that Hollywood could have done better in this case.
0691130272|4.0|This is a very thick book and covers a ton of material.  I also like that some of the images of galaxies are in color.  It starts off by going over some basic concepts, so even if you aren't very knowledgable on the subject, you could probably get through atleast most of this book.
0143122916|5.0|With the political landscape currently playing out in our news and North Korea playing center stage, this book is one that everyone should be reading if you care about the United States' involvement. Not only does it give the reader insight into the machinations of a total military thinking tank, it provides needed information about this closed society. I was not aware that the South Koreans are not especially empathetic about their northern brethren (as their entrance to their part of the peninsula will only cause them more hardship due to overcrowding, poverty and ever-present famine).  The author was extremely effective in conveying the plight of Shin, but truly staying loyal to Shin's account and allowing the reader to absorb it. What a horrific story, a true story and one that anyone who cares about the United States' involvement and this potential powder keg, should feel obligated learn about. With what is going on now and this \\"man child\\" running that country, Hitler comes to mind.

B00915G6MG|5.0|This 10th season of NCIS is one of the best yet, imho. Other shows have fizzled out of their 10th season but we already have an 11th season promised and they are going stronger than ever. I love how the relationships and back stories of the characters have developed, with more one on one with some of them (ie Jimmy and Ducky as in a recent episode and the episode of how Abby became interested in forensics) I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD. I hope they give us LOTS of DVD extras as a 10th season celebration! Here's to the 11th....and beyond!

B008133MDK|5.0|While I believe the writers killed off Sherlock too quickly, the rest of their re-write of the original short story &#34;The Final Problem&#34; was well done. Cumberbatch and Freeman delivered well each and every scene. I am very excited about Season 3. If you have not watched Sherlock BBC than you are most certainly missing out.

B00B8PRDHE|5.0|This captures the essence of a great night. There were so many highlights it's hard to know where to start. The Joe Walsh Special guest apperance is great & the Lukather/Rolie combination on the Santana songs are fantastic. Ringo is the ultimate host & the ending with all the Special Guests is EPIC! It was great to see Luke & Vince Gill having a BLAST at the end. Luke was all smiles the entire night. It was also cool being there seeing a wide variety of people enjoying themselves at the show. It was an AMAZING night as it was Ringo's 72nd Birthday at the Historic Ryman.

B00B23O97Y|5.0|Eric is good enough to name himself &#34;Old Sock&#34;.These songs were chosen by “Old Sock” himself as personal favorites from his own life. To heighten the experience, he invited some friends to come and join him on the record—folks like Steve Winwood, Chaka Khan and Sir Paul McCartney.  Billy Holiday made &#34;All of Me&#34; her song, but McCartney and clapton now own it!

B0016B6ZKG|3.0|\\"So many years ago on the radio/She crept into your soul and learned to love you.\\" Yes, and we loved to love you, too, baby. Donna Summer sounds happy to be making a new record, some 17 years after her previous album, but she sounds conflicted. Does she want to reclaim her position as Queen of Disco (\\"I'm A Fire\\") or just be the Queen and you should lover her for it? \\"The Queen Is Back\\" (from which the opening lyric is taken) is a reminder that, when she was a superstar, she had the world in her pocket.<br /><br />Her performances are decent, yet the material is hap hazard. Did a voice as powerful as Summer's really need to be vocodered on the title track? Ziggy Marley drops in to make the song more credible and the message seems to be a reflection on her old controversy with some of her gay audience. \\"Fame\\" does the same thing, with a auto-tuned chorus. Granted, it's not as blatant a ploy as the high NRG dance ploy of 1989's \\"Another Place and Time.\\" It's just that the album sounds generic. If it weren't for the quality of Summer's singing, this could be any-woman music of the 90's, even if it was released in 2008.<br /><br />The highlights are \\"Stamp Your Feet,\\" \\"The Queen Is Back,\\" and bluesy \\"Slide Over Backwards.\\" It's a shame she never got to release any more music, because despite the plainness of the songs (and it should be noted, she co-wrote all of them), Summer is obviously relaxed and enjoying herself on \\"Crayons.\\"
B003UF01SS|5.0|On a record player, the sound is beyond greater than a cd could give.  I love it, I am a huge HUGE A7X fan, and this album is amazing!
B00B7VPKMY|3.0|As indicated by the title \\"The Studio Albums 1972 - 1979,\\" all six of the Eagles' studio albums are here, and by now, everyone has their opinions of them. As for me, \\"Hotel California\\" is an indispensable album, and I have a very soft spot for \\"On The Border,\\" the first Eagles album I owned. But what you get here is problematic.<br /><br />The albums are from the 2002 remasters, which is fine. There are no bonus materials, so by now I am assuming that everything recorded from this decade that Don Henley and Glenn Frey want you to hear has been released. The CD's however, are packaged in single-slip cardboard sleeves. That means the gate-folds of, say, \\"Hotel California\\" or \\"The Long Run\\" are left behind. It also means that the print on the sleeves ranges from small to teensey weensie. There are no historical notes included with this box set. I guess if you want history, you'll have to watch \\"The History Of The Eagles\\" on blu-ray or read the copious notes in the two-CD \\"Very Best Of The Eagles\\" from 2003.<br /><br />Also, since the box-set from 2005 could contain \\"Eagles Live,\\" why not this one? Seems a bit skimpy to me. Still, you're getting the entire studio run of Eagles' albums, of which only \\"The Long Run\\" comes anywhere close to being a clinker. If you don't already have the discography or you want to delve past the greatest hits, this set will do as a quickie insta-collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 did not disappoint.  This show has great writers, and good actors, which really make it all work.  I believe this ranks up there with the best shows on tv, including &#34;breaking bad&#34;, and &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.

Definitely a great game for anyone who enjoys horse games.<br /><br />Well I have to amend my review because it was a great game until it started spamming me with ads every time I do anything. I bought in game content which is supposed to stop this and it was not spamming me with ads until after I bought the gems. So I have to rescind my 5 stars even though I was thoroughly enjoying the game the ad spam is unforgivable.

B009FZFONO|4.0|I love Amazon streaming.  The quality is great and I can watch on my phone when I'm stuck somewhere.  The Walking Dead series is very good (the comics are excellent) and the tv series has done a nice job of adapting the comics.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|2 Stars, That's all folks.  Maybe you can play a video game while you rent it, but I would wait for Prime or Netflix.  This comedy takes a stab at a good conundrum, but fails to deliver.  Beside for just being too long there are a few funny scenes, the movie makes me check the time left so often that I even finished watching the movie the next day.  I know their were a lot of great intentions here and I am a Paul Rudd fan.  Simply, It's like a lot of movies that just feel off and does not hit home.  It's your time and money so spend it wisely.  Don't say I didn't advise you.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Excellent movie!  It is so good that my students do not even mind it is in black and white.  We pair it with A Time to Kill for a unit of study and they do a film comparison.  Gregory Peck is awesome!

030758836X|5.0|I thought this book was simply fantastic. It's the kind of book that you can't put down once you start reading. I've loaned it to my mom and 2 of my girlfriends and they've all loved it!! The author takes you on a roller coaster with insane twists and turns in the story. I read the book when it first came out, and I just went back and re-read it and it was just as amazing as the first time! I will say that I was underwhelmed with the ending. After the incredible writing up to the very end, I expected more. The rest of the fantastic writing redeems it, though and I can easily see myself reading this a 3rd time soon.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Excellent movie, a must see.  A wonderful accounting of the struggles that the Jewish people encountered during Adolph Hitler's reign of terrior.<br /><br />GW

0062014536|5.0|So, I regretfully rushed through another book. My biggest downfall with reading: I can't get enough, but I want it to last forever. I finished REQUIEM, Lauren Oliver's final installment of the Delirium Trilogy. It definitely had me eager to turn the page (so much so that when I was done, my response was \\"Whaaaaat?! ALREADY?! Nooooo!\\") My problem always is that I find a book, realize it's a series, have a party (by myself), read all the books in about 2.5 seconds, and mourn the loss of an amazing book series for about a month, and repeat.<br /><br />With REQUIEM it was no different. Oliver has one of the best writing styles I've seen -- she can define the voice of her narrator very well. This is especially true in REQUIEM with the alternating POVs. She draws you in, gets you to love (most) of her characters, and then pulls it all away from you. You're left to sit in a corner and cry by yourself because this realm that you've put your mind and body in for three whole books has ended and now what are you supposed to do?<br /><br />Anyway, for those of you who haven't read the Delirium Trilogy yet, you really have to. It's along the lines of The Hunger Games and Divergent, but with one of the most compelling stories (especially if you're a teenage girl). In this dystopian society Oliver has laid out for us, love is an infectious disease which must be vanquished from society, referred to as amor deliria nervosa. The story centers around Lena, a girl nearing her \\"cure date,\\" where she will be injected with the cure for love, and essentially devoid of all feelings and attachments. But then she meets Alex, a boy, of course... and she realizes just how amazing love can be. While it sounds cheesy, or typical, or boring (I've heard all of these ridiculous generalizations), Delirium is none of these. The story is a compelling, heartfelt, page-turning adventure that literally left me in tears at the end of book one.<br /><br />Now having finished the third and final installment, I really don't know what I could/should do with myself. The ending is something that most people (so I've heard) dislike. While I initially had this reaction, due to its gut-wrenchingly open-ended, leaving-me-wanting-more ending, I came to realize just how important and profound the ending is. Lauren Oliver is able to sum up the entire meaning of the story in the last few paragraphs better than most writers hardly manage in an entire book (or series, in some cases). I don't really want to give too much away, because 1) I hate spoiling endings for people, just as much as I hate having endings spoiled for me, 2) I want people to figure out their own interpretation and thoughts about the ending, 3) Yes, there is a love triangle, and yes she does more or less \\"end up\\" with someone and I don't want to reveal who. So, please. Do yourself a favor. Read this book. Read all of these books. Even if you've never read a YA book before, or a dystopian book before. Even if you've never read before. Take your time. Breathe it in. Live it. Because once it's over, it will probably be one of the worst days of your life. I almost guarantee it.I really don't know what I could/should do with myself.

You won't be sorry that you added it to your family/kid-friendly movie collection.

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Ok, I regret passing on seeing this in the theater after watching it on Amazon.  It is a great action movie that is fast paced, and a far departure from the 1995 Spandex version by Sly Stallone.<br /><br />Trust me, if you are an action movie fan, just watch it and you'll see.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00BOLE7X0|1.0|Haven't watched yet....will soon.  But I hear that this is a movie with an agenda....to promote Sodomite \\"marriage\\".  So, my one star is based on that and I'll be watching to see if that's the case.  Wouldn't put it past Hollyworthless or King Speilberg.

B007HACDLK|3.0|I chose this book since it was a Mitch Rapp novel but was deceived by it.<br /><br />It did not have the intensity and trill of the other books in this series from this author.
B001QW8QYS|4.0|Looked really good on my Blue-Ray.  Acting was first rate.  Robert Taylor and the complete cast were just the ticket.  An outstanding movie.
B00B8WXFWE|3.0|I may be a guy, but am a lifetime NKOTB fan. I think they have had a great career and fun music to listen to. It was amazing what they have done in the last few years since their reunion. However, I honestly think it wasn't the best choice to allow another production compnay to take over for this album. It's not their signature sound, it sounds more like Europop, just not for me. Maybe it was meant for a more mature sound since they're in their 40's, but I wasn't really feeling it. Sorry boys, I'm still a fan, but this album didn't really cut it, best of luck on you tour and I hope it's a great success as always. Peace.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|First do misunderstand me I really enjoy watching the movie. I think they have now a good understanding of Tolkien corpus. They have translated in pictures in a way not so different of my understanding of the stories even if there have been too much war actions and green screen visual effects in the movies for me.<br /><br />But the marketing operation to sell the movies makes me sad. Like another review I do not want to buy any blue-ray versions because I do not wait for a coming extended version but rather the final marketing box offer of the trilogy on 2015! I bought the DVD two-disc special edition. After going through all the advertisements I could watch th movie, at last. When I wanted to see a making of on the second DVD I found nothing alike my expectations but already published stuff. I wondered even why the aim of this edtion, a one disc edition would have been enough with the internet link for the already published extra features.<br /><br />My conclusion:<br />It is Warner Bros which killed Harry Potter not Vodomort by the marketing sale operations of the movies, DVD, etc. It is Warner Bros again which killed Neo in Matrix not agent Smith by the marketing sale operations of the movies, DVD, etc.<br /><br />It would honest for them to release the movie trilogy every six months, I and we will be very happy not only be seen as potential marketing targets but as happy readers of Tolkien books or as happy movie goers too.

B003VTZSFY|3.0|Morris' book manages to be both tedious and fascinating in equal measure, ending with one of the more remarkable chapters found in any book of this sort. He spends way too much time explaining a tiresome and stilted metrics system that he uses to measure civilizations, intermixed with an expansive overview of all of human history. But the last chapter, a projection of the next 50 - 100 years, took my breath away.  Book = redeemed. Skim and then read the last chapter.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Best game, good graphics, awesome multiplayer, what more do you want  I played this for 6 hours straight nothing but multiplayer
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Best movie of the year in my opinion and quite a history lesson to boot.  Walked away after 2.5 hours wanting more.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|What an awesome rock album. At first I thought that it sounded similar to Clutch albums past. After giving this album a good listen, I am convinced that this is their best work in years. I can listen to this one ll the way through and not get bored. Each song is full of emotion and heart. I honestly believe that this is the best Clutch album in years.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|This, I think, is one of the best series of the Stargate franchise. Good story, action, and enough humor to add to the story, not make it campy. I suggest watching the entire series back to back.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I like the storyline it is a lot better than I expected and thought it'd be.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great for anyone who likes puzzles. No extra space needed, no card table in the living room. Lots puzzle options from size to pics.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This album is a classic and was a big change for the Grateful Dead.  Their previous albums had been jam oriented, this one showcases the songs.  The songs are all well written, and their use of vocal harmony creates a series of gorgeous tracks.  It's all still in the Dead's stoned-out folk rock style, simply better done than before.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are, for the most part, more like what you'd expect from the dead.  The live tracks don't have the best sound and they showcase the solos more.  They're worth the listen, just not as good as the album proper.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I haven't finished it yet but it's amazing so far!<br /><br />Good work Suzanne Collins!<br />It's the best book of the series!<br />Can't wait for the movie!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A good story line. Good graphics. Creepy enough without being cheesy. The level of difficulty is pretty good, and there's a map that lets you know where you are and where the action is.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is one of the best games i've ever played. The resson i gave it four stars is because you have to wait a long time to refill you energy. i wish it didn't take so long.
B004FEJ3VY|5.0|Why did you choose this rating? I loved the very good product<br />What you like or dislike it, I have no complaints Product<br />Who do you recommended this product? And personally I chose this product browsing AMAZON
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing, and I think it helps a lot for teenagers to read this. Because it gives us something to relate to when things are tough. In a world where you are constantly being judged, it can all be hard to take sometimes, but reading this always seems to give me some sort of consolation and reassurance that everything will turn out fine in the end. This book is a masterpiece, enough said.
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|This maybe a older movie but it sure has served the test of time and it is Well Worth viewing even if you have seen it years ago! I purchased a copy for my Daughter-In-Law plus a copy for myself! I would Highly Recommend it! It maybe a old movie however it is a Good one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and so addicting it a really good game when your bored it's worth the time and trying to unlock xp
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book was the first book I bought on my new kindle, and within a few pages I knew I had made a great decision.<br />I felt immersed in the story, I could see it all happening in my mind - not just reading words as some books make me feel. The twists and turns in this story just make me keep reading. In a week I had read the four books so far in the series and cannot wait for the next installment!<br />If you love old, mythical worlds with kings, magic and love, this book is so hard to put down.<br />I will definitely be reading more of Morgans work!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great replacement I can charge my kindle and keep on reading my books and surfing the net I love it
B008OOYALE|5.0|There is nothing wrong with this app that I can find except how much gold really costs. But other than that, THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER!!!!!!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was well done and very good at capturing the details of what was going on during that time.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved this movie - - appreciated the accuracy in the telling of the story. The actors all did a great job building tension and keeping it real.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I read a lot of the reviews the first day because i discovered that neither the Blu-RAy nor the regular DVD would allow me to pause and resume or pick a scene. After testing my player on several other DVDs and BRDs, I can tell you it is this set and not my player. I guess there was a rush to get the movie to market.<br />It's a movie, not the best but not the worst. Hugh Jackson is great, as is Eddie Tremaine, and I thought that Russell Crowe did the best he could with a script that limited his character's story. Understand that they had to limit the duration of the movie. Maybe better to limit the on-going chanted dialogue and increase time with the actual songs. Normally I like Anne Hathaway but I agree with others that she didn't show any of her character's strengths. I think my complaints are more against the director.<br />Interesting - while i was waiting for the  movie to recycle through the first hour when it restarted at the beginning rather than resume after pausing - I turned off the sound and occasionally watched the actors without sound. Impressive acting!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I can't believe this is my new favorite time killer.  it just goes to show that a good concept and execution will beat spectale and graphics every time.
B002TXZSLM|3.0|Another good novel.  Always a good spiritual message. Good storyline and well written.  Would read more of his books.  Enjoy the way he writes
B005VSRFEA|5.0|This book will give one a basic understanding of the interactions and connections we all share in our collective systems.  The ability to see broader and clearer will improve for the reader.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is sooo addicting!!!! I absolutly love it and highly recomend it! It is very well written and will keep you on the edge of your seat!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I gave 5 stars for this app, as I cannot sleep without brown noise, or brown noise and thunderstorms together.  I have a brain injury that makes silence make my head spin, but it also latches on to words and 'ticks' if I try music or tv.  This is the perfect solution as I can listen to any combination of noises I want!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Enjoyed this action and adventure flick. The characters performed well enough and not a heavy duty love story, which kept the movie from being slow.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is a story which anyone can relate to and enjoy.  Rodriguez is such a unique human being and so refreshing in this age when the motivation for so many musicians seems to be money and fame more than just the joy of creating music.  I hope that through this documentary Rodriguez will gather many more fans worldwide and be appreciated not only for his songwriting ability and musicianship but for the modest, non-bitter, very appreciative and grateful man that he is.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This first third of this book began to get tedious and I was about to put it down when I got to part two and I loved the twist! I couldn't put it down until I got to the last third and it became tedious again, I really didn't like the ending at all...
0385495323|5.0|This book is very well written.<br />The writing style is so easy to understand and the content so engaging that once you start its difficult to stop.<br /><br />It gives an overview of cryptography's history, the main players and the algorithms used.<br />This overview follows the real historic path, so you'll get a clear picture of the invented techniques and of the progresses made (by code makers and breakers).<br />Every key player is nicely introduced, characteristics, history and achievements, and inclusively a picture is presented.<br /><br />I only regret that the explanation of Quantum Cryptography could have been a little deeper.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has a lot of fun games in it and a lot of variety.  It does require some time to build up to unlock a new game.
B004ADV552|5.0|Go buy this cd/mp3 if you love tenor sax, and want to hear one of the great greats!  Buy it now!  What are you waiting for???
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this game every night before falling asleep. Not intensive but interesting enough. Also I appreciate. I can play this game for free.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I received the order in the time indicated.  The mail sent time was incorrect, so I was looking for the package much earlier than it was mailed.  The DVD's were wonderful.  I missed the entire !st season, part of the 2nd season, and part of the 3rd season.  It was fantastic to be able to watch the complete series.  I invited friends to have a Downton Abbey party.  We watched the entire series over 3 days.  I will continue to order from this company.  When I emailed them to check on the delivery, they replied immediately to see what the problem was.  They emailed me back to say that if I did not receive it within the due time, to let them know and they would correct the problem.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|If u like Majong u will like this game. Not bad for free!!!! Highly recommend it to fellow lovers of this type of game.
B009HNDCC4|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning series of this show but it's getting boring to me now I still watch it because I paid for all the series but not my most enjoyable show
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Good but a little too Hallmark channel for me - In your face romanticism, and political correctness unrealistic to the era. The actors, especially Maggie Smith, and the amazing Downton Abbey estate make it good television.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|i can't know how to reset the clock! it is difficult for me to figure without a guideline... thumb down!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well. When u play subway surf it looks like its in 3D and you are actually subway surfing. It is a really fun game but it is also addicting in a good way not bad.
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl is a tremendous roller coaster ride. The pages turn quickly as you delve into both Nick Dunne's and Amy Dunne's perspectives on their rocky marriage and Amy's disappearance. Flynn is a master at presenting key revelations throughout the novel, which have you changing your mind as to which character to root for. As with any story, there are always two sides, and Flynn shows both of them very well.<br /><br />Flynn's writing is exceptional. While easy to read, the writing also experiments with traditional styles, provides deep point-of-view, and offers thought-provoking metaphors.<br /><br />Caution: Use of foul language is abundant.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert/Opinion: I was not particularly fond of the ending, which seemed abrupt and somewhat disappointing. But despite this, it was a well-written, adventurous novel.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great Movie, if you like Lord of the Rings, then this is a must see. I didn't read book, but really enjoyed this movie. I read the Lord of the Rings and Loved the movies. Great for Tolkien fans.
B003KRGCTI|1.0|I'm sorry I ever purchased it, it was recommened and I'm sorry to say it is not a movie I would ever recommend.
B0095H4FAA|5.0|Stieg Larsson trusts his readers and proceeds at his own pace: deliberate, thoughtful, intriguing, yet action packed at the right moments. Lisbeth Salander is a remarkable new character in fiction: diminutive yet dangerous, remorseless yet likeable. The magazine reporter Blomkvist seems plodding as he inexorably discovers truth, then punishes perpetrators by bathing them in their own deceit. After a suffering a brutal attack, Salander is catlike in dispensing her own justice, results satisfyingly exceeding the crime. Together they face each other's dangers; apart they find their own very separate truths. We wonder how Salander navigates her imprisoned world, then marvel as Blomkvist comfortably circumnavigates his own.<br />Evil doers never see this pair coming, or casually dismiss their disparate skills; the powerful are brought to their knees while the world around them proceeds at its own implacably pedestrian pace. We fear for both our heroes when in danger, then uncomfortably nod in agreement at the brutally Biblical justice they dispense. Would we...could we...do the same?
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is a cool game I think all ages kids elders and adults should give this game a try the free roam is super amazing I hope you enjoy this game
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It is fast and fun but I only wish it had more tracks the one is okay but it gets really boring! THX 4 listening! Watch for my reviews their always quick and true!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and nice to learn some history. Just wondering if it is all correct. Some of the acting was a little blah. Yes I would recommend it any how.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|First, as regards Joe Jackson's DUKE ALBUM:  If you want a 1920's/1930's Duke Ellington recording there are hundreds to be purchased.<br />Joe Jackson put his own Joe Jackson touch to the music of Duke Ellington.  In other words: Joe Jackson modernized the Duke sound.<br />Now, Bryan Ferry has recorded his own music in the style of old 1920's jazz.  Probably because he has an affinity for that sound.<br />Dear G. Ratcheson, don't disparage Joe Jackson.  Bryan Ferry has created the perfect sounding old rendition of more modern music.<br />He did an excellent job.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app!!!!! It's Challanging and very fun.I play it way too much!!!! I feel addicted to this game.You can beat it if you put your heart to it.But know it gets harder and harder as you go up and up.Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|This book is interesting but as many other authors this is much of the same.  I am waiting for another of her gripping books.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter. She loves this movie. Very good quality picture (nothing to complain). Nothing different from other DVD.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Too many issues with streaming. Movie was interrupted too many times. I most likely will not use Amazom Instant video to rent another movie.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love the characters and the flow of the story, never a dull moment.  Dark and not a feel good kind of show but like the Shield except with a biker gang instead of a police vice unit.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|i love Jane Austin movies, i would recommend this to anyone who loves her stories too.<br /><br />i also ordered Persuasion
0374533571|5.0|Saw the movie, loved it!-I  HAD to read the book! Liked the book better than the movie!!! If you kinow anyone that is a bit obsessive and impulsive- this book is for you!
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I did not pay attention to the fact that I was ordering this CD from someone in the UK. It took me almost a month to receive it. Next time I will be paying closer attention when ordering.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the way E L James writes and loved the characters and story line.  I would love to see the series made into a movie.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|A must read if you work with marketing, PR or any other communication. Fluent language and lots of examples makes this book a joy to read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the way E L James writes.  I was surprised by the relationship between Christian and Jack.  Loved the ending side stories to finalize the book.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I am having good results and I loved the stories in the book. I also bought Tim's other 2 books as well.
B008MILL9G|4.0|I like the storyline of all three. Good casting. Interesting story and take on it. Would recommend for the price
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Superbly written life story of a SEAL Team six member that provides inspiration to the reader. A book, and a life that will last in memory for a very long time. Thank God for the warriors that protect the freedoms we take for granted.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Gorgeous film,Scenery, photography and story. A sad tale when a young boy loses his entire family but becomes a man on the rough and beautiful sea. I am a fan of all tigers. Gorgeous creatures! Bringing the boy and the tiger together to survive and then have them be separated after going through so much together. Tugs at your heart strings.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Year after year, the expectation is that Pixar will release the best animated film, with second fiddle going to either Disney or Dreamworks.  The two possible exceptions to this trend have been Dreamworks' \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" and Disney's \\"Tangled\\".  Now we have another alternative, \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\", Disney's big fall release of 2012.  Following in the transformation of Disney films from fairy tale musical to more focused on action and comedy, this movie contains elements from many of the other successful animated films of the past 20 - 30 years.  First, its numerous references to video games both overt and sly hearken back to the first Shrek, and to a smaller extend, the Toy Story films, in how they feature associations to culturally known icons.  The film's ensemble cast, and their relationships on stage also bear striking semblance to prior animated hits, most noticeably Monster's Inc.  Sully corresponds to Wreck-It Ralph.  Mike Wazowski becomes Fix-It Felix, and Boo is now Venellope.  The key difference is that the relationship between Sully and Wazowski in Monster's Inc is flipped 180 degrees in Wreck-It Ralph.  For me, the best part of the movie was the soundtrack; mixing elements of hip-hop, techno, disco and the traditional video game background music, it was a key part of the film's emotional punch.  As for this blu-ray / DVD package, it contains the film, the short clip that came before the movie in the theaters, and some additional features.  Like Disney's other films, the extra/deleted scenes are just sketches with voice-overs.  All in all, a great film and my vote for the best animated film of 2012.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Slow beginning but gets better as it goes along. great action! Always happy to see 007 return! A plus film
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|This book is an overview of the important features that will be included in the new HTML standards. As with most O'Reilly publications, it is written with programmers and other web professionals in mind rather than for the general public.<br /><br />The author seems to be especially impressed with several new elements that extend the language in the areas of media such as audio and video. He also spends time discussing the ease with which a web designer and programmer will be able to pull content from external websites and manipulate this data or content. He advocates more sharing of content resources amongst sites including media and sections of code.<br /><br />As a sometimes web programmer, I would have appreciated some code samples implementing and highlighting some of these new features to get a better feel for how they might be used and how they could be an improvement over the way things have been done under the current language standards. Since this ebook is actually a sample article rather than a full-blown, in-depth book on the new HTML5, I suppose we'll see these coding examples only in the full book.<br /><br />Recommended for a technically experienced audience.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|I loved  the original and love this longer version even better! Tim Burton has outdone himself. Great story with love, humor and friendship. Really happy to see this one again and again! Love going back to the time of the classic Hollywood monsters and horror flicks
B006MW3V6U|5.0|AMAZING show/characters/scenery/costumes! Wow!<br />Moves along pretty darn quickly for a drama series!<br />Those Brits sure know a thing or two about telling a story!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Really love the new additions. Great story and love story. Really makes you feel like you were on the Titanic living this moment in time
B004XANKVO|5.0|I am Pre-Med student.  While studying for the MCAT and having Classes I need a backpack where I can fit all my material.  Even though I have tons of stuff inside its still compact and doesn't stick out like my previous book bags.  It stores items efficiently and the padding on the back allows it to sit snug against my back.  What can I say?  I love it!  You definitely get what you pay for!
B004XQO8JG|3.0|A lot of action but not one of his best. Interesting storyline though. Good film for the money. Enjoyable. Good story
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved watching this show. It's fantastic. Warning: this end of this season is heartbreaking. I just leave it at that.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Excellent program. Love the reboot of the series. Great cast! Love the stories Highly recommend. Alex is great! A lot of fun
B005DJREJS|4.0|Well written, funny. A bit too much emphasis on alcohol consumption as a way to have fun.  There are other ways to have fun, people. But I love how funny and sarcastic Jenna and her friends are.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I have been a fan of Transformers since childhood. Love these films. Can't wait for #4!<br />Great action and storyline. Really love seeing and hearing Optimus Prime and Bumble Bee.  So great on BLURAY!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I recently started watching the walking dead from the beginning.  I was caught up within a week or so and on the edge of my seat for the season finale of season 3.  Can't wait for season 4, october can't come soon enough.  I love this show!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Love Tom Cruise in the role! Really a lot of action and good storyline.  Just as good as the other 3 MIP.
B000002O4X|5.0|Beautifully done, great variety and not boring. Follows the movie nicely. I have worn my copy out playing it. Combines some recognizable classics and cultural music from the background of the movie which are really wonderful. If you enjoy a variety of instrumental music that is pleasing and soothing, this is a great choice.
0802130208|5.0|What a thoroughly enjoyable book. Such rich and intriguing characters.  The dialogue is complex, hilarious and deep. I can't get over how well this book was written by a first time author.  Such a pity that he chose to end his life.  Can't imagine why this book hasn't ever been made into a movie.  On the other hand perhaps a movie couldn't ever do justice to the rich quality of the book. I'm afraid the PC police wouldn't ever let this book be made into a movie without seriously stripping it of its lovely dialogue and characters. Just leave it to the reader's minds eye to see the rich colors, tapestries, streets, settings and characters.  Farewell Ignatius.  Such good fun.
1451695195|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about NDE's.  It is very well written and easy to understand. For a doctor to explain in writing such complicated brain processes and medical issues to a lay person, he did a fantastic job.  The subject matter was a unique perspective for an NDE.  I have read many books on the subject that were scientific based and those that were from a singular personal viewpoint. This explained both well.  I review books thoroughly and am picky about what I choose to add to my collection and I would definitely suggest this book to be added to anyone's collection on the subject.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is fun to help pass the time! Love to play when I'm trying to relax! Keep up the good work !
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game I recommend to anyone. Time flies by..and also big fish games are  one of the best companies..Love their games...
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I liked many aspects of this movie; however there was never a point where I felt overwhelmed with the emotion and bewilderment that Lincoln is famous for. It was just okay, and I will probably never watch it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. It is really fun and enjoyable. I would recommend this to everyone. Hopes for the future: pet dogs and cats, birds, electricity, minecarts a<br />nd railroads, guns, scuba gear, planes, boats, and perhaps cars.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|Very good plot kept you guessing and of course great effects. Wish they would do a better bridge for the enterprise by now though looked a bit outdated!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the best and it is the only game I play I play it every day after school
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Dredd was an excellent remake and I think is was superior to the original Judge Dredd. From what I understand, the Dredd follows the Comics closer than Judge Dredd did...
B008J34466|5.0|I pre-ordered this before I knew she had a deluxe version exclusive at Target, I gave this one to my cousin and bought the deluxe which is worth the extra pennies, of the 4 bonus tracks 3 of them are some of my fave on the album
B00BVYJG18|1.0|Disarm The Descent sounds like it was recorded by a 15 year old with a few cheap mics and a macbook. The bass drum is so clicky that it sounds like someone recorded a single click from a click track and used that for the bass drum sound. The toms are so overly loud that when Justin does a fill or plays a beat with toms in it, that is ALL you hear. The guitars, including the bass, are so thin they have no presence at all. I couldn't tell you if the songs are any good because I can't bring myself to listen to it long enough to find out.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|the original movie with Charles Bronson wasn't ripped apart by this remake which I really appreciated, and I think Jason was a good choice for the remake
B00133KFGW|5.0|It thoroughly captivated me. I'm not a fan of Robin Williams but he did a creditable job.  Besides, any film Alex O'Loughin is in can't be all bad, right?
B003Y5H57E|5.0|love the story line, how it all linked at the end, chemistry between Emma and Ryan was so natural, great movie
B00005JPSM|5.0|I have this in my collection and purchased it for my sister-in-law.  She's a great fan of Catherine Zeta Jones.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I have used the case to support the Kindle in portrait and landscape on flat surfaces.  I use the elastic strap on the inside of the cover as a handhold when reading.<br /><br />I would like to see them add a couple of velcro dots or a latch between the back of the section holding the Kindle and the portion it hinges against to keep it from flopping when it shouldn't.<br /><br />Other than that it works well enough that I ordered a second one for my wife's Kindle.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I was a little reluctant to purchase this as I was under the impression it had a sad ending but not so, some parts were 'tear-jerkers', and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Of course this movie is great. I've seen it at least 5 times. I don't really know how I'm supposed to review such a popular movie. I really liked it! You should too :)
B006FE83UE|5.0|I never tire of viewing this classic, and I watch it at least once a year, if not more often.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie rocks. I've watched it countless times. The sequel is great too. If you're down for an action flick- check this one out!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The gritiest doctor yet.  Production is a little lower standard at the  beginning but a noce reboot of a classic series.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I was enthralled by the first 85% of this book. It was a very quick read. Jack Reacher is a compelling character. The ending left me with an 'eh' attitude. Not sure why. I will read the next Jack novel.
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the best Bond films yet.  Daniel Craig is the greatest Bond since Sean Connery.  Recommended to anyone who likes Bond and anyone who likes thriller, action flicks
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Being a major celebrity (Mclaine) sure doesnt equal to being a qualified parent.  What a sad life this child had, money doesnt buy happiness or is a substitute for ones parents growing up........it makes one wonder why McClaine even had a child given how narcissictic , self absorbed she is,  and to feel her child was competing with her, give me a break, she should have been flattered and encouraged her childs dreams instead of sabatoging her and later her family....The fact that the writer came out of this despite her circumstances is miraculous in itself.......kudos to her for surviving and accomplishing in her own right............
B008YZXYY2|5.0|... and it's a great one at that! Beginning with the face melting power anthem 'Gone Sovereign' and seamlessly moving into the groovy 'Absolute Zero', the album kicks off with a solid 1-2 punch. Tracks like 'A rumor of skin', 'My name is Allen', 'RU486' and 'Last of the real' keep the intensity high and the energy levels pumping while tracks like the almost soulful 'Tired' make sure that there's enough lyrical depth to rank as in my opinion the top album of 2012. A must have for any 'Stone Sour' fan old or new. Adding a bit of mystery into the mix is the fact that this is a part of a 2 piece concept album with an interesting story and engaging characters at its core. Looking forward to part 2 as well!
B0097HSS4M|1.0|no big shakes,  very VERY basic,  effects suck,  a waste of space,  no real avangarde options, total blah boring boring
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I found this series a very enjoyable read. Unfortunately all the hype is about the sex in the first book! What everyone is missing is t he actual story of Christian Grey! He is a very complex man and the love story between him and Ana is a wonderful story. I loved this series and highly recommend if you like to read good love stories.
B001JIHGO0|3.0|Nothing special. But the teenagers in my house liked it. Too long though. Almost like a lot of the action was just to fill time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were fantastic! Suzanne Collins is brilliant! These books are ok for teens, but I think you should be at least 13 because of intensity.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great family movie for all ages. Love the little yellow people. Good story line. Excellent ending.<br />Even teenagers in my house liked it.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|The first week was hard,I didn't think I was going to make it---the following week was easier. I have a tendency to fix the easier meals and stick with them. I'm 69 so find it a little hard to lose weight, I'm hoping to lose about 15 pounds.  The first week I lost one lb. which is less then some of the other reviews but then I think they were younger and it's easier. I found that my measurements for the food were not quite the same as the authors, don't know if that is due to the difference in British and U.S. standards.  All in all it works, you just have to stick with it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I expected a more dramatic ending. But still a good way to tie up loose ends for the season. I thought the second to the last episode was the best though.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I expected more.<br /><br />After winning the several academy awards I kept waiting for the acting to pop off the screen...it never got there.  I enjoyed Daniel Day-Lewis but that was about it...I surely have seen better acting in the form of supporting actor and actress this year and even out of these individuals in other movies.  Yet again disappointed in the Academy their choices.

B008Y78M60|5.0|This movie provides us with historical details about the trial of Mary Surratt, who was tried in a military court and hung as a co-conspirator in the plot to kill Lincoln.  Once again, our government is found to be lacking in concern over the rights of the individual and shows little concern for the principles set forth in the Constitution.<br /><br />The cast is top notch.  I did not find much to criticize in this movie.  I highly recommend it if you are at all interested in the untold truths behind what we were taught in history class.

B009NH6AOQ|4.0|I love seeing the zombies in varying states of ... umami but this show has really dragged for me and I really hate the commercial breaks BUT ever since the Season 2 finale, this has been a different show.  Having read the wikipedia on the comic, I dreaded Season 3 and while I hated the Andrea parts (unlike her conduct in the Season 2 finale), this season delivered so many more scenes that were just treats compared to the previous two seasons.    I would definitely buy this season for the maximum price of $25.  I think it would be awesome to be able to sit through a commercial free marathon but if it is never priced right, I will just watch via netflix.    I would never recommend Season 1 and 2 but this season was better than decent.  I noticed that Carol was practicing a la  Mengele when preparing for Lori giving birth but I never learned that this show is named after the musselman of concentration camps until I read [[ASIN:0806510226 Moni: A Novel of Auschwitz]].  Unfortunately, that means that this  incredibly entertaining show is the delivery system for what the musselmen were living in the midst of i.e. the destruction and decay of murdered fellow inmates some missing body parts because of the starving prisoners delayed their own executions unlike the cannibalism for unity practiced by the Japanese army on Chinese citizens as well as Allied prisoners of war quarterway around the world at the same time.      ++++++++      The walkers in the pit and their ending echoes    MASSACRE ON PALAWAN (December 14, 1944)    One hundred and fifty American prisoners of war, were incarcerated in a P.O.W. enclosure situated on top of the cliffs overlooking the Bay of Puerto Princesa on the island of Palawan in the Philippines. While working on the construction of an airfield they were made to dig three trenches 150ft long and 4ft 6ins deep within the camp. They were told that the trenches were air-raid shelters and practice drills were carried out. The shelters were small and cramped, the prisoners sitting bunched up with their knees under their chins. When an American convoy was sighted heading for Mindoro an air-raid alarm was sounded. The Japanese guards, thinking the island was about to be invaded, herded the prisoners into the covered trenches and then proceeded to pour buckets of petrol into the entrances followed by a lighted torch to ignite the gasoline. As the prisoners stormed the exists, their cloths on fire, they were mown down by light machine-gun fire or bayoneted, shot or clubbed.    Dozens managed to get through the barbed wire fence and tumble down the fifty foot high cliff to the water's edge only to be shot at by a Japanese manned landing barge which was patrolling the shore. Only five survived by swimming across the bay and reaching the safety of a Filipino guerrilla camp. One prisoner, who tried to swim the bay, was re-captured and brought back to the beach. There, he suffered the agony of having petrol poured on his foot and set alight. His screams delighted the guards who then deliberately set fire to his other foot while at the same time prodding and stabbing his body with bayonets until he collapsed. His body was then doused with petrol and cremated. His remains, and the bodies of the other dead on the beach, were then buried in the sand. US Forces captured Puerto Princesa on February 28, 1945, and weeks later discovered 79 skeletons within the enclosure. They were given a proper burial by the men of 601 Quartermaster Company of the US Army. In all, 145 Americans had died.

This is not a Mill, or a drill press, but is pretty good at small jobs.<br /><br />After 4 months, the swivel part that clamps the rotary tool snapped.  Replacement part is $18 plus $5 for shipping. Not sure it is worth paying half the cost of the machine to replace 1 part.

B0089EHWQE|4.0|I read this for a book club.  I was surprised by the subject of euthanasia. I wasn't expecting that based on the brief summary I read.  It was easy to read, and I related to the characters, especially being in the medical field myself.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I am a huge P!nk fan and this album rocks!<br />All her great work, although I am disappointed that<br />her duet with Steven Tyler (Misery) is not included.<br />Still, all in all, a really good album!
B008602KQI|2.0|There are some good parts to The Hunger Games movie, for instance, the casting is superb, and the acting is quite good. Ross manages to tell the story more or less, packing quite a bit in the film's 144 minutes. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.<br /><br />If you've read the book, you know that The Hunger Games includes a huge amount of detail, and trying to scale that level of story down into a single movie is a daunting task. If I were directing, I would have likely lobbied heavily for two movies: one that gave you the backstory on Panem and Katniss and took you into the capitol as it prepared for the Games, and a second movie beginning in the arena so that there's ample time to give you a sense of closure once the Games come to an end (in addition to showing how the Games develop the characters' relationships). (The story, after all, is more about the before and after of the characters.)<br /><br />The plot moves much too quickly, leaving the viewer with a sense of incompleteness and a feeling that they're probably missing some things (they are). That's not the biggest flaw in this movie, though I think it's probably one of the main contributing factors. This feeling may also be exacerbated if you just finished reading the books, which I did about 3 weeks ago. Perhaps a second viewing after some time would be more enjoyable.<br /><br />The biggest issue with The Hunger Games movie is the lack of emotional connection. You don't get to really know the characters. You aren't given much insight into what they feel. There's not enough dialog and human interaction throughout the screenplay to help you make such a connection to the them--especially concerning Katniss.<br /><br />Part of what makes the books so enrapturing is that you get to experience everything that Katniss does. You know what she's feeling, even though sometimes you don't like it. That's a hard thing to do in a movie where everything switches from first person to third person, and you either have to \\"experience\\" a character's emotions by their expressions and actions, or they have to tell you (by telling another character) what they're feeling.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br /><br />I think the prime example of this movie's flaws lies around the subplot of Rue. In the book, this is a believable interaction--Katniss teams up with the younger girl, helping her along, developing a connection with her, and finally making a plan to seriously cripple the Careers' ability to survive--a plan that goes smoothly until Rue hits a snare and is killed while Katniss watches. It's devastating.<br /><br />Contrast that with the movie, which compresses this scene in such a way that Katniss meets Rue, teams up, makes a plan, and Rue dies all within about 5 minutes. Yet, in the aftermath, Katniss is devastated. It's a bit hard to sympathize with her though, because we don't really understand how close the two had become.<br /><br />Likewise, we know in the first book that Katniss has more or less fallen in love with Peeta by the end, even though she refuses to admit it to herself and spends the next two books in the trilogy trying to resolve the internal conflict. But again--the movie utterly fails to clearly demonstrate this critical plot line, and the ending is just a total wreck.<br /><br />Character development around Cinna, Haymitch, and Effie is also quite weak, yet Cinna and Haymitch play critical roles throughout the final two books. There's a lot of catching up to do in this area if the rest of the movie franchise is going to work.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Hunger Games movie was a promising idea, that with a different director, might have succeeded. (I still don't understand how Suzanne Collins found all of this acceptable--though, after reading Mockingjay, maybe I should.) I'm encouraged to know that Catching Fire has a different director, and I can only hope that he is able to course correct where Ross and company failed.<br /><br />My final thought after seeing this movie was only that I hope the series gets a reboot and a remake in my lifetime. A book as good as The Hunger Games deserves an equally good film, and 2012's attempt simply does not do the story justice.<br /><br />Here's hoping for next time...ought after seeing this movie was only that I hope the series gets a reboot and a remake in my lifetime.

She has a unique voice that hovers above deep, layered melodies, from the first to last track. I was hooked from the first note she sang, and after I saw how devine she looked I fell in love. If you've had your heart broken and you would risk it all again, then this is the cd to drive off the edge to.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A friend of mine once said that you know you are reading an outstanding book when you find yourself in the middle of the day wondering what the characters are up to. This is my experience with \\"Wool.\\"<br /><br />It has been a long, long time since I've been so engaged in a storyline. I'm a pretty serious reader. I'm at the point in life where I don't want to waste my time plodding through a novel that is poorly written or underdeveloped. One of the downsides of the self-publishing boom is that there is a lot of sub-par literature emerging. Stories drop off in places where they shouldn't, characters are underdeveloped or overdeveloped, but dismissed midway through the plot because they were nonessential. Basically, there's a lot of emerging literature in need of great editing.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that while reading \\"Wool\\" and \\"Shift,\\" I have felt word by word that my reading is in the hands of a master. Howey has honed his craft impeccably. I whipped through Wool so quickly because it was simply fascinating. I've sped right along to \\"Shift,\\" and am about to finish that as well... My only complaint is that there isn't enough! Can't wait for \\"Dust,\\" and only wish there were more coming after that.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|this comic is not that bad compare to the movie so fans from the walking dead you will have fun reading this comic
B0095H4FAA|5.0|An intelligent, ingeniously plotted, utterly engrossing thriller.  It was truly exceptional, very meticulous in all its details, crossing every t and dotting every i.  Beautifully paced, even at 590 pages.  Two marvelous main characters, although Mikael Blomkvist is not as fleshed out as Lisbeth Salander, and I did think towards the end his personality seemed to shift around a bit.  We never learn how he really feels about Lisbeth.  The Swedes are perfectly capable of having sex with \\"friends\\", being quite casual about it all, unlike the guilt trips Americans must put on themselves sometimes.  And Lisbeth.  Blomkvist mentions Ausberger's Syndrome, but not very firmly.  What was it that made her so against men and people in general?  What ever happened with the lawyer?  She remains an enigma, right to the end.  A cast of thousands.  Thank god there was a Vanger family tree.  Is Larsen saying that these horrors are genetic?  I believe it must be.  A very dark-hearted story, unique and fascinating.  Murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue.  Complex and atmospheric novel.

B00AJLHUAS|5.0|This retro concept album is so well produced that the packaging is in the form of a book with slick glossy cover and Art Deco fonts. Illustrations are of Josephine Baker, with banana skirt and not much else, fox-trot dancers, and even a cubist form suggestive of Picasso's costume design for Erik Satie's ballet, Parade. [While the tempered sound engineering, designed to capture the 1920's sound, may be suitable for .mp3 downloads, you will otherwise miss the very worthy CD packaging and notes!] All the songs are by Bryan Ferry, at least in part, recorded earlier in art rock style for Roxy Music, but the performance style here is modeled on bands of the Roaring 20's and the early Jazz Age. The 15-member orchestra covers the usual cornet and trumpet, trombone, clarinets and saxophones, and piano, and adds viola, violin, double bass, and cello strings, and guitar to join the characteristic rhythm banjo of the time. Ferry asked the ghosts of Duke Ellington, Bix Beiderbecke and British dance band leader Billy Cotton and saxophonist Buddy Featherstonhaugh to visit for inspiration. Interestingly, the title's of Ferry's modern songs fit nicely with the romantic tunes of yore, such as Avalon, Don't Stop the Dance, and Slave to Love. The result is much more than a curiosity piece. It simply works. Pianist Colin Good scored the arrangements. Ferry's song, Isaac, and Michael Knight designed the packaging. The entire enterprise is delightful.

I wish they would have gone into more of Emily's character but I was very relieved with the ending. It made my heart hurt but it was worth it!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It is a great movie and all, but I think a couple of scene could have been taken out. Do not recommend for children because it is too violent and has a scene where it shows a couple kissing and acting to sexual in bed which did not have to be shown.

B00AHSMDQY|1.0|The movie totally sucked. I thought it was supposed to be a family movie because my little ones like batman. Way too adult oriented. It was like they were trying to take the original movies, but totally change it and fail tremendously. Waste of money and time.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The creators of this exceptional and brilliant drama are still hard at work, but it seems like, with this third season, they've started to slow down the pace of the storytelling. There's an occasional episode that is action-packed, but then the next two might be slow and short on substance. I am all about spending more time with these characters, but I want to be glued to the screen, like I was with the first two seasons. I'd be happier with fewer, more cinematic episodes.
B001DPHDCY|1.0|Kids did not even like it. We expecting it to be more interesting like the Dr. Seuss stories. Some parts were not very respectful which kids will reenact what they see and hear. Just teaching kids to be disrespectful. Thanks a lot who ever made that movie.

B00933JL0A|4.0|This game is very similar to the Win 95 game 'Serf City'<br />You build up a mideval town by bulding population and assinging them tasks. There are supply chains to consider, ie: to make bread you need a farmer harvesting wheat, a mill to turn the wheat into flower, and a baker to bake the flower into bread (the baker requires wood that is chopped down by a lumber jack).  All the people are animated - the lunber jack will go out chop down a tree and bring the wood back to his cabin, where another person will come to carry the wood to storage or where it may be needed.<br /><br />The bigest difference between this and 'Serf city' is there are no fuedal lords attacking you, so no warriors or guard huts / towers.  which for me I prefer, I like to focus on the building and developement, not have to worry and be distracted building a military and fighting.<br /><br />Be carefull, this is a time consuming game, takes a long time to build up a town.

B002PY86WI|5.0|Finally for those who held out from buying Madonna's many many hits, there is finally a best hits album that definitely delivers a bang for its buck. At a reasonable price, you get to enjoy A LOT of Madonna's greatest hits throughout the decades.<br />This is a must buy for any Madonna fan that hasn't jumped on the wagon yet.

B0001HAHXW|5.0|I've been a Clapton fan since my early teenage years since I started playing my father's vinyl collection. Then I progressed on to heavier stuff and for some reason forgot about him for a few years. After looking at a documentary retrospective I bought this and  was not disappointed. I'm back playing this and two other albums non-stop since they arrived.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It's an awesome app, but when you first get it it runs so slowly...<br />But then again, it goes faster and faster the more you play it.<br />I love how you get to breed dragons and get hybrids.<br />Get Dragonvale. You will NEVER regret it.

B0084AZXKK|5.0|Great story from classic author. It stands up to thy test of Time. It wss as enjoyable now as it was when I was a kid. I'm 56 now. Unforgettable characters and dialog.  A great read for 12 and up. Shiver me timbers! Arrrgh!
B0091VTISO|4.0|I recommend this movie for a true action movie fan!  Its surpizingly good!  And its a good Sci-fi addition to the Conan movies after so many years, its a pretty good job.

B005COO1X6|5.0|Always loved King, this is a Classic example of his abilities to, In relativly few words, capture and explain, believable characters and true horror.<br />Go read
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|The movie wasn't as horrible as I thought it was going to be after reading all the bad reviews. It was funny and I could appreciate the humor. My husband and I are 26, no kids yet, so maybe that's why we thought it was funny. I imagine if this is your life is this movie you wouldn't find it so amusing. Altogether not as good as knocked up but worth watching.
B0030ZOYHC|2.0|An excellent movie at an excellent price. But beware: If you check the back cover's content description, you'll note that a 20-page art book should be included. Not in this edition. In fact, it looks somewhat cheap, and you can tell when you read &#34;bluray&#34; on the upper trim and &#34;dvd&#34; on the bottom side of the cover itself, which looks like a color-copy of the original slide cover.<br /><br />If you check unboxings on youtube, you'll see the real edition, on par with the nice Evangelion 2.22 (including art book and a much better quality slide cover). In short, the movie is phenomenal as expected and this edition is just fair for the price I paid, but I feel kinda deceived anyways. Try to buy it elsewhere (in person) and check the contents first, if possible.
B004I8JUE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Told entirely through letters from one person to another, it keeps your interest and makes you feel you're personally involved.<br /><br />Loved it.  Bought a copy for my friend's birthday.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I live this app. I use it constantly. its easy to use and the cross platform syncing is perfect. pictures and files can be sent too.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did not enjoy this storyline in any aspect.  Kept reading in hopes of sudden improvement, then morbid curiosity.  Would not recommend under any circumstances.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Glad I got it, totally worth watching. It had a good story, great visuals and was just entertaining all around.<br /><br />It's good even if you're not into video games at all, so go nuts. :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great weather content, just love it. Set up just the way I like to see the weather each and every day as well as weekly.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Because this was worth grabbing, HD. Theatrical and directors cuts, all sorts of legit.<br /><br />Watched them all with my wife. Good times.
B0017HEX76|1.0|Beware. This version is in Korean. Look for one in English, unless you want Korean. I am returning this for an English version.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Lots of young T&A. That's pretty much the only good thing you'll get out of this movie. However they are portrayed as teens, so that might be a bit awkward if you're older... you pedo! lol
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This set has a little bit of everything. The part of Helm's Deep is nice. Good and bad guys with plenty of weapons. A rearing horse and a siege weapon. My kids love it. Refuse to take it apart to build other things and the Rohan warriors are the new heroes of every battle. Well done LEGO! Now make an Isengard set with ents!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This was a fun book to read.  I enjoyed reading it and would like to read more books by the same author.  Light reading and very enjoyable.
B0091REZMW|3.0|You have to have a larger screen to be able to see the hidden items because you cannot enlarge the rooms.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I liked the story and the acting. I thought the movie would have actually been funnier with less bad language. Some was okay to set the tone for Ted's character, but I think if they had drawn the line a little sooner, the movie would have appealed to a broader audience. Overall, I thought it was funny and entertaining.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I did not care for World War Z for two main reasons.<br /><br />1) I enjoy character development in books I read, and World War Z has about zero character development.  You're presented with a new character every 5-15 pages or so, and if there were repeats, I was so detached from the characters I didn't even notice.<br /><br />2) Where are the women?  I had been reading the book for several days, when I stopped and realized that none of the many characters in the beginning of the book were women.  And then, I flipped to the next page.  There she was, the first female character, who discussed gossiping around the work water cooler, and being too preoccupied with raising children and her weight to be overly concerned with the zombie apocalypse......REALLY?!  I'm not saying that many women don't discuss these things, or that there is anything inherently wrong with this character, but when I'm flooded with a sea of male characters of an extreme variety (heroes, scumbags, doctors, politicians, leaders, academics), and of the maybe 10 female characters in the book (I didn't count), several of them were overly domestic and gender-stereotyped, I'm going to have a problem.  We're talking about a book with dozens and dozens (if not hundreds? again, i didnt count) characters, and only one female character stands out as memorable.  I was so thrown by this that I googled &#34;World War Z sexist.&#34;  Granted, nothing came up, and I'm not calling the author a sexist, but I have literally never read a book before where over and over again I was frustrated by apparent sexism.  Frustrating.<br /><br />However, I have to give World War Z a few stars, because I did finish it after all, and there were a few chapters that really kept me reading.  But, I was disappointed.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This flick lives down to its name/ it is indeed very dark...the torture scenes that begin the flick are graphic and basically ruined the rest of the movie for us.  I would not recomend to friends or family.
0140177396|5.0|This slim volume is packed with beauty, compassion, insight and tragedy. It is  a story of two farm-hands traveling together in California in the 1930s. These two farm-hands have a special bond: George is small and clever whereas Lenny's huge and mentally disabled.  They share a vivid dream of owning their own land one day but tragedy occurs before they can bring their dream to fruition.<br /><br />The story begins in a clearing where Lenny is cradling a dead mouse. Lenny loves petting soft things but he is unaware of his own brute strength.  George takes care of Lenny and cautions him to stay out of trouble. George's devotion to Lenny is touching. The pair present a picture of goodness and beauty in a harsh world. Indeed, George tells Lenny:  \\" Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don't belong no place. . . . With us it ain't like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us.\\" Lenny loves this recitation and frequently asks George to repeat it. \\"Tell me about us, about how we different from other guys.\\"<br /><br />The first time I read this book I was in high school; a girl growing up in a suburban home. The story of two male farmhands struggling in the 1930's and yearning for land did not resonate with me. I couldn't relate to it. However, I recently reread \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and realized how much more there is to this little volume.  This books raises many important themes but one seemed to be of particular importance -- the theme of loneliness.<br /><br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" shows the many brands of loneliness. The farm-hands are lonely because they constantly travel and have no roots. Lenny is lonely because he is mentally disabled and unaccepted by society. Candy is lonely because he is physically disabled and he is afraid he will soon be canned. Crooks is lonely because he is black and forced to live alone in a room, apart form the other farm-hands. Finally, Curley's wife is lonely because she is female and stuck on a farm in a bad marriage. Throughout the book, each of the lonely people reflect on how crippling the loneliness can be. Lenny and George have each other and that takes the edge off their loneliness but the others have no escape. And in the end, George too is alone.<br /><br />The loneliness depicted in this book is poignant. Most of the lonely characters are lonely because society marked them as different, as inferior. Lenny and Candy are lonely because they are disabled; society has rejected them. Similarly,  Crooks, the black stable boy, lives alone in a room because society determined he could not sleep in the barracks with the white men. Society rejected him to because of his color.  If more people took George's approach and accepted those who were different and weaker, there would be less loneliness for both the strong and the weak.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Love, love , love this series!!<br /><br />Wish videos would not stop to load occasionally!!<br /><br />Watch all the time!!<br /><br />enjoy!!<br /> thanks
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The story was amazing and it gave me a sense of knowing each character personally.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I like star wars, I even love it. I do not however analyze each film frame by frame. While there are noticeable differences to those who care, it is visually appealing, and in my opinion a good addition to your movie collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love how entranced the story line has but I hate to think how it will all end for them. Now I'm craving to read the last book
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Never read the books but enjoyed the Lord of the Rings extended edition movies. After seeing it through, I am amazed and very excited to see the next in the series. A great adventure movie with characters you will fall in love with, super effects!

B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I think this is a fantastic time management (tm) game.  This is so much better than the &quot;dash&quot; tm games by Playfirst (and less expensive too!).  I really look forward to buying the sequel to this game on my Kindle Fire 1st gen.  I understand that the sequel is available for the Pc.  Hope to see it available for the Kindle Fire very soon.  Way to go Playrix!  Great game!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I had forgotten this classic, I only had distant memories, but when I watched The Godfaher, I had to see it again, but with my father, because he has thaught me the world of cinema and we have shared this passion through the years. The second film is excellent too, he third one is about a man whose decisions have made his family come undone, and he is in his last days. I love the featurettes, the wedding album of Connie, and the restoration process feature was a delight for me. I'm pleased with this item, it's a must.
0394826817|5.0|When I read this book, I found myself nodding my head so much and lovind the lessons taught. There is a story about the little pig who said &#34;I won't&#34; whenever his mom asked him for help. Then he learns he is missing out by always not wanting to help when his brother &#34;I will&#34; gets to have a fun day at the dock.  Sweet little stories about how to act appropriately when you are a guest and how to treat others. It is just darling. My daughter LOVES it because she watches the Richard Scary cartoons on Saturday about solving mysteries. She keeps asking me to read this book to her. I love being able to teach these lessons through this darling book. Highly recommended. :)
B004SIPA4G|5.0|It was like the first time when I watched the recut. The behind the scenes are just what a fan can require from a favorite movie. I have to see the theatrical cut, and of course I'll be delighted to watch it in HD. Five stars for this item. Thank you Amazon, I'm a big fan of yours!
B008602KQI|3.0|WARNING --Psuedo Spolier.<br /><br />It is a modern day re-telling of The Lottery, the 1948 short fiction from Shirley Jackson. It was largely predictable and without serious twists and turns. The better path would have been to give the characters more development and more reason to kill one another than because the rules demanded it. I watched it in two sessions and was multi-tasking whilst doing so. I could not have made it through otherwise. It was rather tiresome. Jennifer Lawrence is not a sympathetic actress, at least in this movie. The character, whose name I believe was Catness, or Cat-in-the-ass...was unattractive not believable. How did she develop all the skills and knowledge? It is not worth pondering long, for the movie is thankfully over, and in my mind at least, shall be quickly forgotten.
B00BNPUA5Q|4.0|Test devices:<br />HTC EVO LTE 4G<br />Samsung Galaxy S II<br /><br />Straight up, I've been a fan of the GO line of apps for a long time.  GO Launcher, GO Launcher EX, GO SMS Pro, GO Locker, and more have graced more than every single one my phones/tablets over the past couple of years. I've always been attracted to the developers continual rapid updates to its products, adding in this, fixing that, tweaking the other, etc.  So when they announced a new 3D launcher, I was all over it.  Until I saw the price.  To date, all the main GO products have been free, but Next Launcher is sixteen bones, more or less.  (At the moment, there is no free/trial version on Amazon, though you can pick one up from Google Play or via the Next Launcher page on Facebook.)  That puts it squarely up against the like of SPB Shell 3D and TSF Shell, (neither of which are available on Amazon).  For that kind of money, I'd be pretty torqued off if all Next Launcher was was a prettier version of GO Launcher EX.<br /><br />Once I got it installed on my devices, I went to town checking it out.  As which previous GO launchers, Next Launcher is all about customization.  \\"Out of the box,\\" it looks really, really good.  Next Launcher does its best to take advantage the CPU/GPU power in today's devices, as well as the more common high definition screens.  The default icons, transitions, and effects are rendered out in what appears to me to be far more detail and clarity.  Widget support is included as always, and the GO team has put together a four special ones of their very own for Next Launcher.  These four, Calendar, Switch, Clock, and Music, are free add-ons which you have to install separately.  Compared to the previous generation's widgets, the GO folks put a lot of time and effort into creating these, making them look and feel like a whole new thing.  That extends to much of Next Launcher too.  As an avid user of GO Launcher EX, I thought I knew exactly what to expect, how it would all work.  I was mistaken.  While Next Launcher does generally work the same way and you'll see familiar icons, a bunch of things have been moved around, look different, and act different.  So, in the end, I can't say that I found it to be just a pretty version of their old launcher.  It's got a lot more going on, and I expect that they will continue to add to it. In terms of performance, I found Next Launcher to be quite snappy on both devices.  The amount of memory getting pulled is more the stock launcher, but not excessively so.<br /><br />Does all this mean I feel Next Launcher is worth the asking price?  While it's good, real good, I do feel Next Launcher is overpriced.  Perhaps that will change over time, but at the moment I don't feel any one thing is compelling enough to spend the money for Next Launcher.<br /><br />*Note: Apps can get updates and change over time, for better or worse.

B003XOXPMK|5.0|SWABLR= She walks like a BEARDED rainbow! Great track....early use of the Vox Wah for Eric Comes in Tales of Brave Ulysses, very trippy lyrics and pounding drums....Sunshine...done in 5/4 time Ginger pounds an American Indian beat almost sounds upside down it is so forceful...Mother's Lament is just great, a fun treat and a nice look at the English sense of humor and pub culture songs...Strange  Brew -yes it is a 12 bar released as a single, which seems boring, but he lyrics and the beat fire this engine, although Lawdy Mama is Better! The Album Cover artwork is cool to hold in your hands and just look at....get the vinyl cover to appreciate it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story. Fantastic clothes. After watching this, makes watching ' regular' television quite boring. We need more series like this

B00846REIS|3.0|I read this after 50 Shades of Grey so it probably deserves four stars.  I thought the character development was good, but there wasn't a story, no excitement beyond the sex.

B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Very interesting, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The only con is that it had no purpose. At the end, you're wondering what point were they trying to get across?
0765334798|5.0|A very pop culture book. It is a bit cliche but if you like Star Trek, you'll love this book. I am willing to guess that the author of this book watched the original series of ST over and over until he could sing along and then realized that certain things really really didn't add up. Just a guess.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They have simplified the game to make it easy to craft items. Ur able to save and even change between peaceful and survival easily. I recommend this app/game.
0307887448|5.0|I am somewhat of a geek, and a programmer making it hard to find well written books that are targeted right at me. This book nailed it. There are so many books aimed at me but written at people who don't understand technology or understand me. Often those lousy books are then turned into movies by people also who don't understand technology or me. So many thanks to the author for this book.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories-Black  is a great small backpack for short trips with camera and tripod and lens.  The reason it only gets four stars are the straps that go across the shoulders are short for an adult male.

B0052UYJDC|5.0|For a reader like me, that hasn't followed her blog online, this is a great way to have her interesting blog posts collected into one ebook. I find the posts coherent, and although there is some overlap, it is not at all as bad as e.g. the incredibly repetitive collection of blog posts that is [[ASIN:1938793013 Minimalism: Essential Essays]]. And I think there are some real gems of thought in there.<br /><br />Be sure to check out her other book, [[ASIN:0984087311 The Joy of Less, A Minimalist Living Guide: How to Declutter, Organize, and Simplify Your Life]], which you will surely enjoy if you like this one.

0553062182|3.0|If your counsellor  mentions `Highly Sensitive Person Syndrome`, your first impulse may be to laugh.<br /><br />First, it sounds like a pretty wishy-washy name.<br /><br />Second, if you already suffer from Asperger (or some other) Syndrome; of what possible use could another condition be?<br /><br />Still, as you're always questing to find your way in a difficult world, you may accept your counsellor's recommendation to read The Highly Sensitive Person by Elaine N. Aron.<br /><br />If you do, you may be struck by three things:<br /><br />1. There's a questionnaire to see just how sensitive you are. Chances are you'll attain a perfect score.<br /><br />2. Elaine is obviously an HSP, and her empathy with your condition is very welcome.<br /><br />3. She offers some useful and practical life tips.<br /><br />Chief among these are:<br /><br />1. Be your own `parent' (i.e. look after yourself as if you still had a living and/or caring mother or father).<br /><br />2. If you're about to freak out in a situation, give it just a bit more time. Promise yourself you can leave if things remain difficult. There's a good chance that after you get over your initial panic, you'll be OK.<br /><br />3. You really can't afford to hide in your room forever. Especially if you have a partner. Give new things a go now and then. If something is too hard, you can always withdraw. But at least make an effort.<br /><br />4. While some parts of the book may be uncomfortable to read, it's true that without some pain there's little gain.<br /><br />On balance, you should find that The Highly Sensitive Person will reward your time and effort.

B0064NTZQ2|2.0|I watched this a while ago on my son's recommendation.  A typical Euro-twaddle triumph of style over substance, if you ask me.<br /><br />The opening scene is brilliant.  Just the driver, his wits, and a toothpick outfoxing the LAPD in slow, meticulous fashion.  I can see the director getting enthusiastic financing on that basis alone.  Which is a problem, because the rest of the film never congeals.<br /><br />We we know the driver is a strong, silent, super competent loner and soon find he is a chaste protector too - a modern Hollywood cowboy.  He makes van Damme seem soft, Bronson the life of the party, Norris a bad case of satyriasis, and Eastwood a chatty Cathy.  While I haven't been through 600+ reviews, I'm surprised I've seen no comment on this 10 foot high neon subtext.  If this is an attempt at a Verhoeven style parody, it's so deadpan, it left everyone behind.<br /><br />No great loss as I don't think this is a particularly effective approach.  Did Starship Troopers convince anyone?  If you want to razz the cowboy, have Dirty Harry deal with resetting a modem/router combo.  Of course, Eastwood would probably pull out the Magnum and shoot the damn thing, and we would all cheer.  But I digress...<br /><br />Which I had plenty of time to do while the long, significant looks, pregnant pauses, and inarticulate longings played out.  Nothing to do but anticipate the unexpected turn of events.  I will concede that the return of Standard and the immediate outcome was different. But soon enough we got on with it, a setup, a double cross, the fix was in!!! Who would have ever expected that???  This is where the film lost me.  I just didn't expect anything so lazy.  I mean what is the point of setting up Standard and the driver if the end result remains the same and it won't fool anyone? Is driving into an empty parking lot in a tinted-out car and sitting with the engine running really the best idea they could come up with?  And what is the point of that stupid mask?Argh...
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom continually keeps his readers in a state of deep thought. I have a whole new perspective on the aspect of time and the role it plays in our lives.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|We bought tickets to go see a parody called Spank! so I finally took the plunge and read this.  I did make it past chapter 2 this time and actually finished the book.  I think all the reviews sum up how poorly written this book is, so I won't even go there.  The story line is actually OK.  I was interested in confirming his issues so I bought book two, unfortunately it was verified on the first page so I haven't made it very far on that one.  The sex scenes (which are every other page it feels like) are boring, and that's about all the filling it had.
B00BEYYEE4|4.0|\\"If you think you're investigating adultery Mr. Taggart you don't know Nicholas Hostetler very well.\\" Private investigator Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) is struggling to make money. When Mayor Hostetler (Crowe) hires him to follow his wife to see if she is having an affair Billy is offered an amount of money he can't turn down. After his findings lead to a murder Billy isn't sure who to believe anymore. I have to admit that I wasn't all that excited about this movie going in. Not a big Russell Crowe fan and the movie looked a little too generic from the preview. While the movie isn't really anything that new I really did enjoy this and was entertained the entire time. There were enough twists and double-crossing going on that it kept me guessing who was telling the truth the entire time. That to me is the sign of a good movie. This is not a movie that will become a classic or win a bunch of awards but it is very much worth seeing and is very entertaining. I recommend this. Overall, a good movie to put in and try and guess the end. I give it a B+.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved the books and I am glad I read them before seeing the movie; I knew a lot of the details they left out.  I still love this movie and can't wait to see how it plays out on screen.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|\\"Imagine everything you ever wanted shows up one day and calls itself your life and then just when you start to believe in it it's gone and suddenly it gets very hard to imagine a future. That's depression, right.\\" Emily Taylor (Mara) is depressed. She has gone to a few doctors but nothing seems to help. Finally Dr. Banks (Tatum) prescribes her a pill that seems to do the job, until she murders her husband under the effects of the drug. Convinced that he was right in prescribing it he defends her and tries to help get her life back. Then he makes a discovery that changes everything. This is a movie where I had one expectation and ended up with something completely different. I thought this was going to be a suspense almost horror movie from the preview. What I got was more of a drama, but also much better then I expected. This is another movie that kept me guessing what was going on the entire movie and so engrossed that by the time it was over I almost wanted to watch it again. The ending is so satisfying that it really made the movie better. I highly recommend this movie. It's the kind you can watch a few times and catch something different each time. Overall, different but much better then expected. I really liked this. I give it an A-.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Love this app. I get up on time, it's easy to use,  and i love how  customizable it is. you won't regret it. :)
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|\\"You think I'm a hero, I'm not a hero. I'm a drifter with nothing to lose.\\" After a sniper kills 5 people the accused has only one request...Find Jack Reacher (Cruise). He shows up and is asked by the defense attorney Helen (Pike) to help her investigate the shooter he knows so well. After Reacher begins to dig what he finds makes him think the shooter is innocent. The problem is no one else does, and some want to get Reacher out of the way. I'm not sure what I really expected to see when I sat down to watch this, but I got something much much better. I think I expected another generic action movie, this is more of a mystery type of detective movie. That said, it is also a fantastic movie that keeps you guessing the whole time. I loved almost everything about this, the only complaint I had really is Tom Cruise. To me he really just didn't fit the part, but other then that this is a great movie that is very much worth seeing. You really aren't sure who to trust and who is pulling the strings. That makes the movie that much more fun to watch. Even for someone who isn't a Tom Cruise fan this is very fun to watch and his best movie in awhile. I highly recommend this. Overall, a very entertaining movie that keeps you guessing, Tom Cruise isn't a good choice though. I give it an A-.
0451232852|3.0|Slow read.  Am waiting for vacation in May to finish reading it.  I need to add eight more words to submit review.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|At first I wasn't sure I would like The Art of Racing in the Rain, but as a loyal member of a book club, I made myself trudge through the first chapter.  By the second or third chapter I was hooked.  If you have ever owned a dog, you've probably wondered what it was thinking.  Stein does a great job of giving Enzo a doggie-personality that many dog owners can relate to.  I found myself turning pages faster and faster as I read wondering what Enzo would be learning or relating back to us people in the next adventure.<br /><br />Although it is probably not one of my all time favorites, the engaging writing style, unique perspective, and underlying life lessons, make this a book one that I would recommend to anyone who has ever wondered what their dog was thinking.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'll be honest and say I didn't really care for this ending to the trilogy. It was anti climactic and I ended up feeling sorry for katniss and her family.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome for people who love war games.Not what I thought it would be but I was pleasantly surprised. Sweet game!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|This movie didn't provide the action that the promotion hype suggested. The music score was good , but the volume of the music seemed to drown out the characters voices. I had to use the close captioning option to &#34;hear&#34; the dialog.<br />I DID NOT enjoy the movie as I expcted.
B003IY48PS|5.0|I have been an evil dead fan the first time I watched the army of darkness where Ash shows everyone his boomstick. The original is the scariest of the entire trilogy, Bruce Campbell was the only humor in this movie. I do know some people that laugh at the tree rape scene but I find no humor in it. What you get with this movie is a classic Sam Raimi film that was a classic when it was released and proved he was an amazing director. The movie itself is just amazing and I had no trouble with the blu ray. I had read several reviews when I ordered this about the quality and possibility of it not even working. The quality was not the best but it was better than some dvd releases I have seen of this film and my player, and LG blu ray player, didn't seem to have any trouble loading or playing the disk. I recommend this to horror fans, Bruce Campbell fans, and people who enjoy B movies
B002JWD6AS|3.0|I thought this was a good read.  Although, I felt some of the actions of the individuals portrayed were not realistic for some of the situations described in the storyline.
B007EECSFA|5.0|loved the story every bit as good as The House at Riverton, lots of twists and turns  looking forward to reading more by Kate Morton
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you're bored and have some time to kill this game is for you.  An easy and fun solitaire that will keep you entertained for hours.  Good speed and no glitches make this app the best I've played since using my desktop years ago.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She outdid herself in the final book of the Hunger Games! Her depiction of the battles waged within the characters was extraordinary!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is clearly a gifted writer. I was hooked from the moment that I picked up this book and couldn't stop reading it until I was finished. I was literally that enamored with.<br /><br />The characters in this book are lifelike, or at least the author makes you feel that way. I suppose that's just a talent in some writers to be able to make characters come to life in the way that Hopeless does with its cast of characters. Holder and Sky literally had me at hello.<br /><br />If you're looking for a an excellent read pick this book, but be sure that you set time aside and clear out your schedule because you truly are not going to want to put this down. Beautiful and very well written.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins continued her story in a very descriptive manner. I felt I was there walking in the Districts. I even felt claustrophobic in the underground levels!
1476733953|5.0|I really am hoping that there is another Wool novel because this story needs to continue.  While the novel ends in a satisfying way the whole story becomes larger and larger as it is unveiled another book or two could easily be written.  The characters are well developed and are placed in a setting that becomes more believable over the course of the book.  I would high recommend this book and have already emailed several friends that they should pick up a copy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Outstandingly fun with great playability. Controls are excellent and only annoyances will be your own failures to react quickly enough. It reminds me of a modern day 3d trigger. Wonderful.
0374214913|2.0|The book started out pretty good for me and I understood it from the beginning.  Clay, a computer programmer, loses his job the recession and finds a book store clerk position at the Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore.  The store is narrow with very high shelves that when you climb up the ladder, it's like going up a mountain of darkness, filled with shelves of strange and unusual books.  This store is patronized by some unusual customers, and I would not actually call them \\"customers.\\" They come and \\"borrow\\" books, not buy, but borrow.  After a few weeks of trying to be friendly and get to know these weird customers, Clay calls on his friends to solve the mystery.  That's really as far as I got and some of the tech speak got me more confused.  On top of that, I had to return it back to the library.  Its own my wish list to buy when I get enough money.  I just could not keep reading because either I was losing interest or just did not understand the mystery.  Don't want to give up on the book, so I will buy it and read again.  Maybe the next time, I will get it, I hope so.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003TLMVVI Black Kindle - African American Books on the Kindle Blog]]
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It never loaded. It May be my phone, it's over rated and glitchy. At least it was a free app...
B005VPRETE|5.0|my daughter adores building with her lego friends sets. Legos have come a very long way in the past few years. Love it!! (but wish teh prices weren't so high)
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Too technical-and I'm an RN, but this just didn't strike any &#34;faith&#34; chords until the LAST SENTENCE!!!  I've read several other &#34;proof of heaven&#34; books, and this was the least appealing.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is a great conversation starter. I found a lot of things in this book that I have experienced too. It's great to hear I'm not alone.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Understandable that this jewel of a movie won the Oscar for Best Documentary this year. Beautifully filmed in Cape Town and Detroit, the facts, ranging from the 1960's to today are presented in a masterfully manner. A must see!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written quick read you won't be able to put down.  The writing style draws you into the characters and the plot line but leaves you unsettled.  I would highly recommend for a great, quick read.
B008M36EEI|4.0|If you feel like an uplifting movie, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is exactly what you are looking for! Well acted and cleverly presented the movie is full of surprises and never has a dull moment.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Excellent story about an amazing hero. Truly worth the read about a man who changed the world for the better just by being in it.
B00BF123WG|4.0|This well acted and directed drama will definitely not dissapoint its viewers. There is never a dull moment and the plot (although known to all) is full of surprises. Highly recommended.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Only got going at the 1/2 way point...it ends with some good stuff...but it took forever to get there! No more than 3 stars for sure.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|The special effects and beautiful photography makes this a &#34;must see&#34; movie. It is a difficult story to put on film, but Ang Lee did a great job as director.
B00B89WXYS|3.0|Native, the 3rd release from OneRepublic, could aptly be described as OneRepublic-lite.  Mostly pop-driven tunes here; nothing special. There are a few good songs in here, and it does have that anthemic feel to it.  First few tracks have a decidedly disco feel. Ryan Tedder's vocals are all over the map on several tracks, particularly evident on \\"Can't Stop.\\"  No way he's hitting those highs without electronic assistance.  Does not have nearly the hooks and edge that Waking Up did. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing inherently substandard with this record.  It's just that this kind of thing has been done many times before, and just doesn't stand out from the crowd.  It just feels stale and uninspired.  It could have been so much better.
B00BHU261S|4.0|After some average reviews I was not expecting much of Hitchcock. I was very surprised to discover a very well-made movie that kept my attention to the very end. Excellent acting by Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins. Why was he never nominated for his excellent performance?
B007OV9EYG|3.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. The only bad thing about it was the quality of 3D. Nothing just pops out at you like most of the other 3D movies I've watched at home. I give the movie itself five stars and the 3D quality one star. I just settled on a three star rating because of that.
B00BESCJII|4.0|This is a very different feel-good movie. Excellent acting and direction but the top prize goes to the &#34;fresh&#34; and thought provoking script. See it and it will make your day!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be re-released in 3D for quite some time. I can tell you it was worth the wait. Obviously your 3D experience will very based on your TV brand. On my Panasonic Plasma everything just pops. If you have Full HD 3D I would recommend buying this movie.
B00BLGZDVS|4.0|The acting in this bizarre drama is superb and there is never a moment where you are bored. This movie is  not for everybody though. I suggest watching the trailer before embarking into the strange subject matter!
B008NNNF7G|4.0|This is only my second Blackberry Smoke album and I wasn't disappointed. They have a unique sound and flair to their music. Take a listen and see for yourself.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|You sit at the edge of your seat when all the drama plays off in the plane. After the &#34;landing&#34; the movie manages to keep the tension going as it holds the onlooker in a guessing game to what is going to happen. There is some superb acting by Denzel Washington.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is one of the best in a very long time, the cast is deep and talented and nothing is over done. Season one adds show much clarity to the show if you've previously missed it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I looooooove this movie. The DVD was in perfect condition. If you have never seen this movie, you've got to see it. Highly recommend this classic!
B007SSDBBM|5.0|I watched this in a long time ago but it's a good as I remember it! God picture quality as well as speed, nice in general.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|That we love Denzel and his usual characters makes his casting in Flight all the more brilliant. We so want him to pull through that it hurts when he messes up. Beautiful psychological portrayal of addiction and multi-generational family influences. John Goodman provides brief, brilliant, and strategic and well-needed humor.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app at first is creepy because the goal of the game is to kill everyone but after you start playing it you want to wipe out all life.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Without the blisters and the pain..<br />As a former backpacker, I cherished every word.<br />I enjoyed her voice and her admired her honesty and tenacity.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I am an instant whovian. That is all. Well not quit all, dalek, tardis, regenerating doctor, end of the earth, the list of reasons to watch goes on and on and on and on and on and on then end at rose Tyler but it was a long list.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Outstanding part of a three book trilogy. Can't wait for the follow up films on the last two books. I am sure it will happen after the success of the first book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|What's not to like? It holds all my gear plus a rain poncho, it comes in classic black, and the price is right. OK, I haven't taken it out into the desert (sand) or a tropical rainforest (damp) but for everyday vacations with an SLR, lenses, flash, filters, batteries, and a pencil or two, this works very well. Thanks to velcro, the compartments are adjustable to fit just about any camera with extra lenses and stuff. The other thing that it fits is a tight budget. If this is important for you, this is the backpack to get.
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|Exactly what I've been looking for on Android, and failed to find up until now. Expansive, well polished, and quite playable. Nicely suited for bite sized chunks, highly recommended. Nicely done.
1451695195|5.0|My wife wanted this book and could not find it locally. She loves stories on heaven and this one seems to have more credibility than most others.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|awesome game but takes a really long time to download which really stinks but other than that awesome so so awsomwe.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|One of the few movies that I will watch and enjoy more than once.  LOVE the old rocker and his nude scene.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was so great because there was no commercials and hardly no loading time....would recommend to anyone!!!! such a great find!!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is another great movie about Harry Potter. Great for all you Harry Potter fans. Loved the great detail in this movie.
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|It was OK for small children but children older than 10 would find it boring.  It wasn't the best animated film I have ever watched and I have watched a lot of children's animated movies.  Kinda of hokey even for a child's film.  Would not recommend for family night.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Little Shop of Horrors is a really funny classic movie that we all enjoyed. It was a blast from the past.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is one of the most iconic albums of the 20th Century. It has enchanted those who have experienced it for more than 40 years. The songs are durable and still hold up after all this time.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Legend of the Guardians I a really great movie with a lot of action. A great movie for the whole family.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I have yet to come across a song or CD that I did not like.  This CD is fun and really gets you going. Highly recommend =)
1452113432|5.0|So far I've enjoyed the things I've cooked from this book. Informative and well done.  Wish Rachel would do some more shows.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Never ever heard of these guys. Was sitting in my room one night drunk out of my mind lol listening to Nikki Sixx's radio station and heard Bully come on. I fell in love with that song but didn't catch the name of the band. Later that week Nikki played it again and I found out there name. Went to Kmart and bought the cd. Now usually I don't do that because most cds, have one good song and then the rest was a waste. Not this one. I bought it and loved every track. I like their other albums but if I would have heard the sound of madness before Amaryllis I wouldn't like Shinedown as much as I do. This album is friggin amazing and every track is worth every penny.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|it is good and fantastic.it is unreal and fair timepass but we could do timepass if u are bored.I just love
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|These books really grab you. The character were good but it was the action that made the serious so easy to finish in a short period of time.
0316776963|4.0|My favorite David Sedaris book. When I need a 'pick me up', I'll grab it and read a random chapter.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I found this a very engaging book with the main charcter, an unlikely hero, both likeable and admirable. He is a highly intelligent man with the affliction of Asperger's Syndrome  Highly functioning Aspergers may quarrel with the term &#34;affliction&#34; but I would argue that it is not pejorative and also, it seems to me, that the main character would prefer not to have the condition.  He is very well aware of his limitations in regard to socialisation and inter-action with others and the constraints this social ineptitude places on him generally as well as on the likelihood of him meeting and engaging a woman enough for her to want to marry him.  His dating attempts and his approach in attracting a woman with the right qualities that he considers vital for his wife-to-be are very humourous.<br /><br />I am not all that familiar with Aspergers Syndrome apart from what I have read about it plus it seems to me that many men suffer slightly from this condition.  I say this a little tongue in cheek.  Nenertheless, I found that this novel seems to really capture well the characteristics, behaviour and perspective of people with this condition.  Don is so wonderfully matter-of-fact about his limitations which he doesn't really regard as limitations even though he can see the frustration and sometimes anger his behaviour causes in others.  He is practical, efficient and also helpful and he wishes he would get on better with people but without the slightest feeling of self-pity.  He is a fully contained person except he thinks it is time he was married.  The only very slight reservation I had about the characterisation is that Don who discusses things openly and honestly, never mentions that he misses sex.  While he would not be missing the emotional side of sex, I would expect a normal man of his age to be somewhat sexually frustrated without even an occasional partner.<br /><br />I am not going to say anything about the story and the other characters.  I personally dislike book and film reviews which tell the reader what the storyline is, what each of the characters did and thought.  Why would I read a book when someone encapsulates it all?  I regard it as somewhat of a spoiler.  I would just like to urge people to read this book and enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />People who have read another excellent book which freatures an Aspergers as narrator in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, will recognise similarities between the two fictional characters and their delightful matter-of-factness.  They are both appealing characters, wise in many ways and kind to others even though they struggle with experiencing emotions. I found both books a very good read and I was sorry to say goodbye to the main protagonists.  If I feel like that at the end of a book, for me it signifies a good novel.
B002VECM6S|5.0|arrived promptly in excelletn condition.  Excellent story so well told.  beautiful. great story of living life, takeing opportunity to live as Jesus taught, and what that kind of life can produce.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  It touched on so many emotions.  It made me laugh and cry all at the same time.  I loved it.
B00003CXCS|5.0|arrived promptly in excellent condidition.  thanks for keeping a wonderful classic alive.  It's beautiful color and sound..  I can watch this over and over- wonderful story of principle and beautiful love story- love it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The characters were very real with moments that had me laughing and tearing up.<br />Without a doubt this book is one of my favorite books ever. There is a dark subject matter and the way the relationship progresses and the past gets revealed had me reading this book every spare minute of the day.
B00786XVOG|3.0|J'ai donné en cadeau ce dvd à un membre de ma famille qui adore Yanni. J'Imagine qu'il est bien content.  La livraison a été très rapide!
B00992CF6W|5.0|love the game but waiting for new update when is it coming out I need it to live!!!please come out
B003UBTX6S|2.0|*****NO SPOILERS HERE*****<br /><br />I'm just not impressed. Like in the story it is right or left, yes or no, death or life, good or evil, and you are waiting for those hugely important decisions to be made but there is always a weird loop hole to get out of making that decision and they aren't even good ones that make sense in the story. It's the like writers had it all planned out, then they just did whatever they could to end it.  It was slowly slowly slowly slowly leading up to this big ending that was supposed to be a big deal but it wasn't and it just didn't make sense at the ending. Super slow over allllll. I am only continuing the series because I have the next book already.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book is definitely a must have. It is extremely action packed, and I don't remember a paragraph were something exiting happens. I HIGHLY recommend this book.<br /><br />Ferdanand
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of those books that you'll want to hang on to and read again!  The book is a look at the air war in Europe during WWII, mainly from the German side and the concept of chivalry among pilots.  At the heart of the book is the sparing of a crippled B-17 by a German ace, but it's much, much more than that.  A great read for a history buff, but also for the casual reader.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|I found it most interesting as the unknown is difficult for most to understand especially a scientific mind and the fact that he experienced this through almost dying is amazing.
B005THRU0C|5.0|Ed Sheeran's first full-length album certainly does not disappoint. He croons his way into the hearts of millions with his angelic voice, spinning tales of love and life. He writes all of his own music, allowing him to really connect with the words he sings, charging them with emotion and power; this, in turn, makes it easy for listeners to relate to the songs. The lyrics are smart, witty, and often unexpected. This isn't today's average artist, who sings about cliche after cliche to an upbeat tempo. The music itself is soft and almost folk-like in some places. Each song is a separate story for you to fall in love with. The album is definitely worth the money.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I don't like it. It is purposely slow. It just wants to get money from kids. I wish there was something better.
B001TODCII|5.0|EVERY TIME IT COMES ON NETWORK OR CABLE CHANNELS WITH COMMERCIALS, I  END UP WATCHING MY DVD TO ENJOY  IT UNINTERRUPTED. IT'S THAT ENTERTAINING. LIAM NEESOM HAS BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTION HEROS.
B00AAVMHJ6|5.0|Riverside is now one of my two favorite contemporary bands (the other is Porcupine Tree). Outstanding musicianship, writing, lyrics are killer. Mariuz's vocals are incredible. This release is outstanding.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Better than number one.  Can't wait for the last book May first.<br />Highly recommend this book as my sister did to me.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Like TLJ.  Story so-so.  Production OK.  Supporting:  Goodman ++.  Sadly, we do not feel a need to see it again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Didn't think I'd enjoy it, but I do. I don't normally play these games, but Jewels Star I do enjoy...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Heard such good things about the series, had to start watching it. Thouroughly enjoying the acting, scenery and story line.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|i love this game and it works as the one on my iphone, keep this going android just great! !
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|When reading this book, at times I laughed out loud and sometimes I was sad and cried.  There are Characters that are mean and cruel and characters that are kind.  But I found the book not at all oppressive, it was easy to read and hard to put down.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|As a big fan of the Lord of the Rings, I was looking forward to this movie and it does not disappoint. There are many characters so you have to watch more than once to know them all. The next two should be more action-packed. One of the best scenes was the \\"Riddle Scene\\" and the scene where all the Dwarfs meet in Bilbo's house. Great hair and makeup, special effects, story line, and acting! Also love the Misty Mountains Cold song!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 overshadows the past season easily. They improved everything about the show!<br /><br />The new actors are phenomenal! Great watch!
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the best Bond movies. Loved the theme song and the scenes between M and James are some of the best. Great cast, acting, directing, and an all-around great film. Definitely one worth keeping!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A VERY well-functioning application. A must-have for every Kindle owner. Great value for the price. Get it now for your device.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I did not get to watch because of too many odd sounds and interference during the movie. I need refund on this charge. Thanks.
B009S33I68|5.0|This is the true story of one of the most ferocious battles of the early war in Vietnam. Told in such a way that shows great respect for those who fought, died and lived through the battle. Many parts left me choked up. Well worth the read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! It's very well done, and the actors are wonderful.  My wife and I were hooked on this show right away, and found ourselves glued to the TV none stop.<br /><br />I recommend this show to anyone who's looking for a great TV series to watch.  Be forewarned to be addicted to it, though!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game love it very cool and I would get it if I were you and is very amazining have fun when you get it
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Enjoyed  the book but felt  it tended  to be way to long and  DRAWN out  when compared  to the earlier  books  on the  series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Sometime in the future, there's been wars and natural disasters. A new world has formed out of the survivors, well, really its a country called Panem where part of the United States used to be. After a rebellion that obliterated distirict 13, the Capitol started the Hunger Games where a boy and girl tribute from each remaining 12 distiricts must fight to the death until only one remains. The books focus on the year that 16 year old katniss everdeen volunteers to take her sweet 12 year old sisters place. Katniss, though, is an illegal hunter, so if she can just obtain a bow and some arrows, she might actually have a shot at winning. Lots of plot twists, an unexpected romance, life or death decisions at every turn make this a decent read for all ages.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Cute chick flick.  Acting was nothing to write home about.  Like I say, a cute chick flick with an old plot.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love everything Bill Nighy is in, and he's extra-charming in this one.  Even Americans recognize the huge British names (if not just the  faces) of the cast -- Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and so forth. Life goes on for everyone.  For these characters, it certainly will never be the same
B009FZHYKU|5.0|fast smooth easy to watch.<br />walking dead has caught this nation by surprise. i watch sitting by the edge of my seat weekly. thanks to amazon i don't have to DVR or watch live.. i can watch for my laptop/ cell phone. life goes on.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This book really got me thinking about many aspects of my life and the lives of those I care about around me.  Although at times it was heavy, I was so totally engrossed it didn't bring me down, rather it lifted your spirit.  I purchased several copies for a book club.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE LVOE LOVE thank you amazon for making it possible for me to watch downton abbey! cannot wait for season 4
B004H6G0TI|1.0|The game will run but you can not play it. The button mapping is way off. Touching the very bottom of the screen will hit the top button. You need to hit a lower button to start playing so I never can start it. No issues like this with any other games.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I enjoy this show. I think it has enought material to keep people interested.  I don't think they need to add the gay agenda.  It's the only part I don't like.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love the character Jack Reacher and have read the entire series. I cannot get enough. His character is well thought out and amazingly logical in thinking. Lee Child writes with clarity, is detailed without being condescending. These books are well written.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It is amazing. You should get the game it is worth it and you evolve in the game alot it is amazing.
B002361MLA|5.0|I have read over 200 nonfiction books, and I would rate this one within the top 5 best of all. It will transform your life forever in a positive way. One thing I like is how it asks practical questions, then provides the answer and application... no generalizations. It is important that an author can answer real-world questions about every-day problems, and provide real solutions. I highly, highly recommend reading this book to understand the power of NOW.  Stop focusing on the dead past and the fantasy future.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We rented this for a family movie night. Everyone loved it! My 8 year old read the book first and still loved the movie. I thought it was great and my husband stayed awake for the whole movie! Even my one year old was enthralled by it. Great movie and I highly recommend it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining series I have watched in a long time. It is so easy to get caught up in the story and identify with the characters.
0679890475|4.0|I bought this book for my granddaughter whose mother has been reading her Dr. Seuss since she was born. These smaller board books are great for little fingers to hold!!
B007HJ8V76|4.0|Tale of a great artist and her husband. Hard to imagine any other actor playing Frida.  A spirited lady from the beginning.
0307931803|4.0|This is a great book, a little smaller in size than I expected but it was fine overall. I would definitely recommend for any child!!
B00333NCTM|5.0|There's nothing like finding out more about the master behind that smile that Ozzy has. This book shares a lot about Ozzy Osbourne. I recommend it to every fan.<br />Beverly Carlin Author of \\"The Wicked Lilac\\"<br />[...] [...]
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is my favorite new way to pass time while waiting for things like doctor appointments or flights. The value could not have been better considering it was free.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I have been on this diet for 10 weeks now and lost over 5 kilos or about 13 lbs.  It is so easy to do and I don't feel I am denying myself anything.  My husband has lost more weight than me and his cholesterol has dropped significantly and for the first time in 20 years he is in the healthy range.  This is an eating plan for life and we will stick to it.  The science behind the diet is explained really well in the book.  It is very easy and quick to read and understand how it works and what to do.  The fast day menu plans are excellent and very tasty.  I think everyone with weight to lose should try this eating plan and I am sure it could reduce the obesity epidemic plaguing western countries.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Downton Abbey is wonderful, alive with rich, complex characters. In this season, I thought Lord Grantham was made to be more of a villain than he needed to be (an old relic, unwilling to change with the times). On a better note, I am happy to see Lady Edith evolving into a more robust character.
145162607X|5.0|AMAZING BOOK! COULDNT PUT IT DOWN! I love this author. GREAT WRITER! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY!
B008Y73940|3.0|We found it to be entertaining.  If you like Matthew McConaughey you'll like this movies.  Not academy award material though.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another wonderful book by Connelly. I love Harry Bosch. This book gave us insight into the characters background. Great, great great.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Thank goodnes for men like Chris Kyle. Well written and very absorbing. I was saddened to find out that he had been murdered 13/2/2013. The world is very quick to condem Americans but if it wasn't for people like Chris  the world would be under the regime of fanatics.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I liked this better than Argo, also a great film.  I read the book it's based on before I saw the movie.  Very historically accurate depiction of the fight for the 13th amendment.  Probably not a film for the younger crowd or those that need action to hold their attention, but a fantastic film for history lovers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This writer is great and the story is great but if u don't like the sadness u may not like It but I would recommend it
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Topical and educational - this book is a must read for anyone with an interest in day to day life in north korea.<br /><br />I was entertained the entire way through.
0425263908|4.0|Getting ready to read it now, Interested to see how it compares to 50 Shades of Grey book series. Shipped fast.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Amazing story that I will watch over and over!  Learning the details of the attack gives me so much pride in our military!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great companion for Plantronics Voyager Legend headset. Compact, lightweight and easy to bring around to use it whenever is needed.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|The novel follows an 18 year old young woman as she navigates living on her own, finding a job, and love and this parallels with her past as she was bounced from foster home and group homes. There are heavy themes that seem to only receive a cursory treatment, the present mirrors the past  too closely, and life does not always work out perfectly. The book is an easy read and was at times, enjoyable.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is a great movie, I was on the edge of my seat from the very beginning. Great cast as well.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|This is a solid DVD - the package is arrived in was a little dirty - but understandably so.... the DVD bore the original bonus footage stickers and markings from a decade ago.<br /><br />Completely worth the cash. No regrets.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love how easy it was to buy<br />And resurch to find the aruther<br />Cant wait to find more on my Kindle<br />  Angie Bird
0307346617|4.0|Packaging and shipping was fast, clean, and the book arrived in perfect condition. The plot moves a little slowly for my liking but other than that it's a great book.
0805095535|1.0|If you're going to write a memoir, wouldn't it make more sense to do it in the first person? Again, another stinker from the guy who was once my favorite author. Saddened that he's gotten so lazy and dull as he's gotten older. Auster should either stop writing or wait until he's got something good to say.
0143118757|4.0|The strength of Getting to Yes is that it is an easily accessible read that teaches you how to improve your negotiation tactics by using the unconscious negotiation tactics you already employ in your daily life. Initially, this sounds simplistic, but once you become aware of how much you negotiate with friends, coworkers, and family, you can use that experience to learn how to resolve conflicts in an unemotional and logical way. The book also uses global conflicts (Northern Ireland and Ireland, Israel and Palestine) as illustrations. I found this interesting, as using such hot-button issues captures the reader's attention and makes us wonder whether even the most entrenched difficulties could be solved by the methods outlined in this book.<br /><br />Getting to Yes, though, is not comprehensive. I have read other books on negotiation that cover many more topics from different perspectives. And Getting to Yes often moralizes in a somewhat offensive and pedantic manner. If you can get past the author's assumption that negotiation is a uniquely moral enterprise, this is a very helpful read.<br /><br />I have definitely used the principles outlined in this book in my own life, and recommend that any interested reader do the same.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  I would recommend it to anyone that believes in freedom.  Lots of Suspense.<br />I believe it generally followed the known information about the historical events.  A good thriller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun, no violence and easy to play. Can be addictive but in a fun way. For kids or adults.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Best game ever.Had a wonderful time .The game was perfect.G5 has done it again.Never a dull moment playing this game.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I knew J.T. was talented, but never in a million years did I think he was capable of making an album this DOPE!!! Instant classic.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|This book totally catched me. As a long time fan of cyberpunk literature and video games I guess I am part of the targeted audience :-). It was the first book I read as an eBook and I enjoyed the fact that wherevever I was reading it, it immediately sucked me into the story. Now I am totally excited to get my Oculus Rift and see waht VR is like in reallity ;-).
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An open look into the life of an American patriot. A great read. Chris Kyle was an amazing, dedicated, faulted man. I'm grateful for his service and that he shared his story.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really like this game. Makes the time fly if you are bored. Not easy not hard...just right to kill time with.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This game is very addictive. I have this new obsession to score three stars. If I don't finish under 5 minutes, I repeat it until I get it. Needless to say it's my new favorite game.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|yes a few move slowly, but still a fantastic outpouring from our friends DM. some exceedingly strong songs and passionate vocals.<br />no one sounds like them, and never will. buy it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|VERY disappointed!  I removed it from my Kindle, because it was so slow and took so long to load that we just gave up.  It's not because I have a lot of things on my device to slow it down, either.  We waited over an hour for the game to save, then another 20 minutes for it to open.  NOT worth the time or effort!
B005PK57IK|4.0|Love that the Good Wife is a part of Amazon Prime. The service continues to improve its value. I am able to watch Seasons 1 through 3.
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|Provides excellent audio for both indoor and outdoor situations.<br />Great accessory for anyone that utilizes video capabilities of their Nikon.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is a classic and I watch it annually with my wife. It is an amazing tale and one you don't expect from either Bill Murray or from a comedy. I respect this movie as a form of movie art for its ability to play with so many different emotions and yet bring it together in a symphony of a story.
B006FE83UE|5.0|An incredible DVD of one of the greatest films ever made.  The movie has everything that you could ask for and the contents of the DVD simply define the format with incredible bonus features.  A rare instance in which a movie is on par with the book.  It's important for all generations to see this story.  It's a tour de force of acting greatness in a story that quite simply provides incredible historical context for a shameful part of american history, while inspiring us to believe in the integrity and honor of man.  Kudos to Universal and all involved in putting this 50th anniversary edition together.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I have a 3D TV and I loved this movie as a tween. I watched this in 3D with my kids and it brought on a whole new sense of adventure. I thoroughly recommend as it is a way to make a great story even greater.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I have been reading her books for years now and I love this just as much as any one of her other ones. In this one the love and bond that a father and his daughter is unbreakable. After what seems a life time her father finds the love of a woman and although his daughter thought she was losing time shows her that his love for her he will take to his grave.
0684857219|5.0|I am a scrawny white guy, but I bought this book hoping to be a buff white guy. I bought the book, read it cover to cover (took awhile) and felt great. I felt EXCITED about working about because I now KNEW what I was doing. I had never been excited before because I felt so self-conscious as a scrawny white guy at the gym. But this book empowered me because, for the first time, I felt I knew the secrets and techniques that all the buff guys knew, I could draw up a work out plan, train different muscles, focus different groups, I had it all planned out and I was excited to be on this journey and see it all the way through. I was getting all the girls, life was good.<br /><br />Now I'm married with kids so such luxury of time is far distant. However, I look at this book with the fondest memories and look forward to the day when my kids are older and I can give them this book and hope they get that same level of excitement I did. And, maybe one day, when I get the time, I'll hit the gym again and become that super 19 year old that I once was.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use and nice big numbers. It remembers the calculations you've done and its very handy.  I use it all the time
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Book is great. It will teach you everything I learned at a Top 20 Law School for negotiations. I liked it a lot. Very short and sweet and understandable.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was one of my favorites. Having seen the recent movie depicting this mission,after first reading the book, made the mission really come to life for me.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I loved this as a kid - thought it was fun. Got this for my kids. They loved it. I am totally reliving my childhood.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is a perfect weather indicator  I have Weather Bug on my phone, but this better.  Easy to follow anywhere you go.
B0087EACJK|5.0|The game keeps prompting me to rate it.It asked for a five star rating to complete a task.I am giving a five star review to get my &quot;prize&quot;Haven't played long enough to properly rate it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I wish Vince Flynn was a more proliferate writer. I love his books. I think he makes Mitch Rapp a greater hero with every new book. I loved how he &#34;humanized&#34; him in this book.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My kids were so excited for me to purchase this game, apparently it's pretty hot with their friends at the moment.  To be honest it doesn't make much sense to me.  The graphics are terrible, the app like to stop on my Kindle Fire and there are spots the guy falls into that he can't get out and the only way out is to start over.  Kinda lame for $7
B000HKYOK0|5.0|So many people in my family are Star Trek fans than I just took it for granted. This show is amazing and definitely worth a look. It's not just for nerds, nostalgic folks or fanatics. Has good plots, interesting acting and great entertainment value. I have started watching them all on Amazon
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is so easy to use especially when doing homework. Not only is it set up and used for easy math but also complicated problems too.
B009G78EE2|5.0|when i first heard &#34;thrift shop&#34;, i thought it was a fun song and that was about it. it's when i heard &#34;Same Love&#34; and &#34;Otherside&#34; that I really started to pay attention to Macklemore. His lyrics are awesome, reminds me of the early Eminem albums, with really funny metaphors and lyrics. Love all the songs on the album, just make sure you buy the Explicit version
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|There are so many &#34;behind the scenes&#34; stories surrounding WW2 that it's sometimes challenging to find one that brings the realism of actually being there along with a unique story arc. I thoroughly enjoyed A Higher Call as it offered vibrant story telling of what these combat missions were like along with bringing you inside the hearts and minds of the combatants. It paints a very realistic picture of both the internal and external conflict a majority of these men faced. I like that fact that it showed all the elements of their service from the tedium to the terror and the way in which each pilot was portrayed as a human first and warrior second. This book went by quickly and easily and provides a great humanistic angle on this defining war.
0767020308|4.0|A great chance to see the classic story &#34;Emma&#34; done by some great actors!  I enjoyed this different version as much as the one with &#34;top name&#34; actors!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Very realsitic sounds. I wish the music loops were longer and not repitious. The thunder is a little too snappy.
B005WNF4NI|5.0|Just to add another 5-star review - I concur with the other reviewers & would say this is probably one of the top 10 electronic albums over the past few years.
0385344333|5.0|This is - IMHO - a good read.  There are times it does string a few of the scenes along, but overall, it is typical Lee Child novel about Jack Reacher and whatever he runs into along his path(s).  Despite any bad reviews by others .... this is a good novel and well worth reading.  Child always takes the reader on a journey and even inserts &#34;things&#34; into his story that the average reader never knew about (Ex:  Locations, places in this novel and how they ended up there).  I tend to think that some (bad) reviewers are just mildly ADHD .... the book isn't a video game.  It's a story that unfolds ... with details that happen along the way.  If one likes the writing and style of Lee Child, then you won't be disappointed.  Heck, read a Grisham novel (another of my favorite authors).  Different perspectives of what they (Child and Grisham) write about, but just as detailed all along the way.  As you can tell, I'm a fan, but definitely a &#34;book reader&#34; who enjoys the details and plot of a well spun novel.  Unlike some authors who run out of material to write, Lee Child still has plenty of roads to travel down for his main character.  Keep'm comin' Lee.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game its way better then the first.I like how it has jems and there not super easy to find but not impossible.a problem that wasn't on the 1st version is now when you earn things like magnet and speed and other bonus abilities you don't have a lot of time. however its still a great game its worth the time. hope you found this helpful!!!
0385535147|5.0|OK.  I'm a Grisham Fan.  And just a few other authors that I only like to read.  Grisham doesn't have a main character in his novels, but his writing style is always perfect (in my opinion, of course).  The rackateer took me for a ride, and with the various twists and turns within the plot, it kept me reading from the beginning.  The main character in this novel and the relationships made along the way, blended into the plot itself .... that is what kept me turning pages and wanting to see where it all went.  I'm usually pretty good at figuring out the storyline, but didn't see this one coming.  I could write more about the book, the author, etc .... but if you are a true Grisham fan, you won't be disappointed.  I waited to buy this one ... as long as I could, hoping the price would keep dropping.  But I just couldn't wait any longer.  Ever since I read &#34;The Firm&#34; and &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; (as well as rewatching ALL the movies made of Grisham's books) ... I knew I'd be a longtime &#34;book reader&#34; of John Grisham's novels.  Thanks again for more sleepless nights, staying up until the wee hours, saying, &#34;I'm just going to read a few more pages and then turn out the light!&#34;
B000S88JTS|5.0|Great documentary.  The 2nd disc of bonus features also very good, especially the segment on Steve McQueen.  Reaffirms what we already know...motorcyclists are mostly good people who like to have fun.
0812993292|5.0|This book is one of the best to come along. The Pilgrimage give Harold many hours to relive his very sad life. It is redemptive though in so many ways. It is excellent reading for man or woman. I give this book an A+. It is a different approach to life.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie done very well.  Congratulations to Ben Affleck.  Would recommend to all mhy friends who haven't already seen it.
B005FITIDC|5.0|The reason I purchased this movie was, that anyone whatever chioces you make in life you will always be acceptable to Christ. If this man is saved you also can be.
B008220C38|1.0|This was not what I was expecting and only watched about the first 15 minutes and won't watch it again.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I really enjoy the build quality of this watch.  The hands are really legible and the strap is sturdy and matches the look of the watch.  I do find myself looking for a metric ruler to test this 37mm size claim.  Overall it was a great pickup as a watch to wear on the weekends in the yard while my other automatic is spinning away in the watch winder.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|It would have been a Game of the year contender without doubt, if not for the fact it is a HD re-release. It was one of the gems of PS2 and has't lost its luster a bit after this many years. Absolutely a marvelous game, not to be missed. One thing with Atlus is, they never drop prices. Which is good for every one, so there is no point to wait. Just buy and enjoy the game now. If you missed it in PS2, it is a crime to miss it again.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|Same as all the rest of the pananormal movies. Very predictable. And scenes shown in previews were not in movie. And lacked an ending.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is one of the BEST series I have ever watched. I have watched it over and over and just cannot get enough. I can't wait for season 4!
B0091VTNZC|5.0|OMG this is one of the best silly, stupid, hilarious &#34;Christmas&#34; movies ever made... but pay attention and you realize that this is really a morality play. Christmas is the McGuffin (see Hitchcock) that holds the movie together, but its really about growing up and family and ethics and morality... Without giving anything away, this movie's best moments are when it deals with the everyday intentional and unintentional bad ethical choices we make. Plus its funny as $#!+ !!!!<br /><br />&#34;He's an angry elf&#34;
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I am a big fan of NOLA music and Hugh Laurie sounds like he grew up listening, playing and loving the music.  I don't know what part if England He came from but it must have been called, Treme!
B0094K1K42|1.0|Boring, pointless and painful to watch trash about a 37 year old alcoholic looser whose best days were as the mean popular girl in high school. She is now an &#34;author&#34; (meaning unknown ghost writer) of trashy teen books with no positive qualities.She goes back to her childhood small town on a psychotic quest to relive her high school days and hook up with her former boyfriend (who now is happily married).
B0087EACJK|3.0|_After reading the reviews I downloaded the game. Simple to understand how to play. However the swiping to get the stick figure to jump and move is frustrating. Either stick figure wouldn't move at all or did move but b<br />not where you wanted it to. I am sure others have no problem and enjoy the game. Worth trying out.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I downloaded this while on vacation and became instantly addicted. The bad use of the English language (the instructions were obviously written by folks whose primary language is not English) adds humor to the mix.  Unlike Bejeweled, when there are no more moves (this game says &#34;No more move&#34;), the board is cleared and a new one presented.  It doesn't end your game and make you start over.  Good addiction.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey does such an amazing job of predicting what I'm typing that it's no longer a chore. I don't really use the Flow option, as I can just type a letter or two to receive an accurate prediction.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|- Purchased 3/2012 from the Egg - 1yr+ at time of review.<br /><br />--- Pros ---<br />* Works<br /><br />--- Cons ---<br />* None<br /><br />--- Thoughts ---<br />* It's a processor.<br />* Intel makes good stuff, never had a CPU go out or be bad over the years.<br />* I always prefer aftermarket coolers for quiet and cooler temps but stock is fine.
B004SDEP38|1.0|So, basically, you can only view any MS Office docs you've created. You cannot create any docs unless you pay for the full app.  Which, i wouldn't have a problem with, really, but you cannot even edit existing docs you've already created and transferred to your phone/Kindle unless you pay for the full app, which is very very misleading.  Free to download, but in this instance, you definitely get what you pay for.  Would not recommend.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|- Purchased Jul 2012 from the egg. Used for 9 months. -<br /><br />--- Pros ---<br />* Happy wife, happy life. (It's in her comp)<br />* Does the job.<br />* Intel has been good to me over the years, never had a bad CPU.<br /><br />--- Cons ---<br />* None<br /><br />--- Thoughts ---<br />* I use an aftermarket cooler with all my builds, just always quieter and cooler but the stock is fine i'm sure.<br />* No need to overclock so I didn't buy the K.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This app is lots of fun takes a long time to hatch eggs but usually worth it! The only problem I have is how much food it takes to raise your dragon and how much money it takes to clear certain items. Otherwise great for me and my daughter!!
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book and cann't wait for the 4th and 5th Chronicles.  Any news as to when they will be on sale?
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The cast, sets, story-line, and effects were all right up there. Now, can they get rid of the &#34;unsteady&#34; cam?
B00846REIS|2.0|I heard this was better than 50 shades. It wasn't.I didn't feel a real story or character development. Just pettiness and porn.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|I wasn't disappointed, though the film was not quite what I expected. Things are never quite what one expects with this director. Good story line, great cast, interesting premise.
0765325950|2.0|I LOVE the series as a whole, but was disappointed with this last book. Now that might be because I loved the other books so much that I had impossible expectations for the end of the series, and it's very possible that my opinion will change the next time I read book 14...<br /><br />Bottom line, this book lacked the heart that fueled my addiction to The Wheel of Time. I was so used to being sucked into a world of magic and amazing characters that I actually had a hard time forcing myself to read this last book. It just seemed really forced, and mechanical a lot of the time. It felt like I was reading a book about military strategy and such instead of reading about the last battle and how it affected the people I've grown to love. There were times that the fun personality and heart showed up, which was almost the only thing that kept me reading, but such moments were sparse.<br /><br />I actually liked the ending, but felt like I had to trudge through the last hundred miles of the journey to get there.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have been playing this game for maybe a couple of months, and I am totally addicted!!! I absolutely love playing the rooms and finding the different items throughout, being able to unlock rooms and quests, and I love the little stories.  I have spent a little money playing it, because it is so much fun I just can't put it down for very long.  It is definitely worth it, though. I just wish my energy lasted a little longer,  but it does increase with each level, so that is something to look forward to.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have not ran across one Jack Reacher book I do not like. As usual Lee Child kept me one the edge of my seat until the very end.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful movie told in flashbacks. It is a story of faith and strength and fortitude. The photography is gorgeous, almost surreal and the ending has an interesting twist.  All in all a great movie to watch.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|When it comes to disaster films, this one has to be in everyone's collection.  Not exactly a great film, it nonetheless serves the purpose it was designed for: a rousing, gung ho, jingoistic, alien butt kicking sci-fi flick.  With no shortage of macho posturing from the likes of Harry Connick Jr. (a cringe worthy performance providing the sourest note in the film), Will Smith (I like this movie in spite of Smith's appearance), and Robert Loggia as General William Grey.  While that type of stale braggadocios can be expected from the likes of the military portrayed, it isn't always appreciated as great dialog.  It is, in fact, quite corny and not a little silly.  Fortunately, the action and the Oscar winning special effects make up for what's lacking in pesky areas like character development.  In those instances, the personalities of the actors takeover and shine forth (Harvey Fierstein, Judd Hirsch, Adam Baldwin, and Brent Spiner).  Regardless of its shortcomings, this is an enjoyable fun ride.  (I was happy to learn that there might be two sequels in the works.  I hope this is true and not just another rumor.)
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|A little boring and sometimes difficult to follow. However, a good insight into the back room politics of congress and the heartache and determination of Lincoln.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is incredible.  Live footage (with good audio and video quality) of several concerts including shea stadium and one in Washington D.C.  Great interviews, done in synchronization (for example, they ask paul a question and he says \\"this might be better answered by ringo\\" and they cut immediately to ringo anwering the question).  I have truly enjoyed this once and will several more times before I turn my son on to it.  Well worth the price IMO.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|It was a great movie and the picture was good and first it was cutting off but I restarted it and no more problems thanks
B000002TYX|5.0|This set, as do Anthology 2 and 3, give insight into the production process, the different takes gone through to create the finished product, the joking and fun between the boys in the room.  A must for all beatlemaniacs!
B00873GRU4|4.0|I've read people call this the greatest scifi they've read. I dont  believe this is scifi. It's much more like post apocalyptic, near future anthropology.<br /><br />Sometimes the pacing is a little slow. I have the omnibus, so do not know which books this affects, but the world is well drawn and explored, the backstory interesting, and the intellectual conflict vs potential consequences give the reader something to think about.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Kids love it. they try it out every day for a little while even I try it to. There is a little daily challange each day plus the more coins you collect the diffirent people and boards you can get to play with.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Was on edge of my seat for most of the movie. I remember this when I was going to College at the exact time. I watched it twice. I plan on purchasing it as well and show my kids as well for a great History lesson.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its a nice game. I try to play it but i was never any good with part one ether but its fun to try.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|I had signed up for amazon prime so I could watch the show for free. However, I was charged $ 2.99 for the episode. I found  out after the fact that the student amazon prime doesn't include free streaming, only 2 day shipping. This was not clearly stated and I feel deceived. Streaming videos was why I had signed up and it should be more clear that you are being charged. The show itself is great, just amazon was bad and I will be sticking with netflix.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I bought it based on a suggestion from co-workers and my taste. It rocks! Super funny. My teenage daughter had to get her own copy after watching it.
B007M45PMU|4.0|love the lumineers. . The download was fast and the quality was great.  It decent price for a full album.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really did love this book. Beyond the message of empowerment for those who have survived abuse of any sort in their lives, the overall plot and cast of characters is what constitutes, Hopeless by Colleen Hoover, as a book worth the read.  Of course, we have a handsome hero and a stronger survivor, but the plot really throws you for some loops that you probably did not see coming.  I know I didn't.  Hoover peppers in emotional layers to follow from chapter to chapter that come to have importance in the long run and an interesting twist to the story line.  In the end under her picture, Colleen Hoover labels herself as a \\"hardcore realist\\" and it comes through in her writing.  All stories of this ilk carry a certain \\"public service announcement\\" air to them, but she takes it a step further.  I appreciate the examples of different reactions and the far reaching affects abuse has not just on the perpetrator and the victim, but also on those that surround them.  She explored how one choice made, even if it's for the positive, can have negative effects on another.  Often times, one we never could have predicted.  As a mom and a teacher, I see the reality of attempting to take the right and good and just corse of action and having it fall into nothingness.  Hoover has a part towards the end where she talks about having to make choices, and what causes us difficulty, is that sometimes all of them are terrible.  If we REALLY could choose, we would scrap the whole lot of them and re-roll the dice. But she puts emphasize the point that sometimes you still have to choose between bad, worse, and terrible because this is life.  Get this one, it is well worth the e-book price!
0205313426|5.0|I had not cracked this book in almost twenty years. As I read through it, I realized that almost everything in it is still as valid and useful today as it was back in high school and college. I would recommend this book to any aspiring writer as a quick reference guide.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|To see all three in a row was worth rewatching the second one. This is a great version of Batman and not as violent as i thought it would be.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the most amazing books I've ever read! Full of unexpected twists and really thought-provoking. You just gotta love Enzo!
B007T2XC7A|4.0|What else could one want-- smart lyrics, great arrangements, and a sweet voice.  Norah Jones is the complete package... can't wait for another album!
B008CFN95I|3.0|On the whole a bit light so I didn't burn the midnight oil to finish it but I liked the characters, loved the book theme and enjoyed the conspiracy element...
1439102430|4.0|I started reading Kathy's books in 1992 with Death Du jour and have continued to read each one as it came out. She has my attention with each one and so far the quality has not changed.<br />This one has my full attention.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I absolutely loved Mockingjay. I've read it 10+ times and I still feel the emotions from the book just as much as the first time. Katniss' pain, Annie and Finnick's love, Gale's rage... I feel the emotions as if it is myself in their position. Suzanne Collins finds a way to convey the emotions of the characters to you so that everything feels real. The plot twists have you holding onto the edge of your seat and hoping and praying everything goes right. Mockingjay, along with the other two books in the Hunger Games trilogy are brilliant and provide an escape from reality right into Katniss' life.
0307887960|3.0|Not a book that you will pick up right away and be able to quickly get started.<br />It does however have some good information.<br />I purchased it as a gift for a friend.

0307887448|5.0|Strangely, after years of buying products off of Amazon and forgetting to rate purchases, I simply had to rate this book.  An excellent read for anyone that grew up with video games and even those who didn't.  It strangely reminded me of Enders Game by OSC.  Highly recommended!
B005BCE7II|5.0|I really and truly enjoyed watching this movie. Especially watching Scrat. He is one crazy critter because he just has to have his nut. I have never seen an animal who wanted something so dog gone bad.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Like the the first matrix movie it wasn't as good as ender's game but it was still a good read.  I enjoyed it.  I recommend it to anyone that wants to read more about ender's universe.

B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Being an owner of almost two dozen Blu Ray 3D movie releases purchased in past year  I was always enjoying  each and every one of them on my 106\\" projector screen and Optoma HD83 gear and latest Optoma BG-ZF2100GLS glasses. The announcement of Hobbit - a \\"masterpiece\\" as called by many reviewers made me believe this is going to be even more breathtaking movie experience I have ever seen so far. Long preorder wait rewarded with disk set arrival was supposed to exceed my expectations - but it didn't.<br /><br />Right from the start, the first seconds of the movie made me think there is something wrong with my gear as 3D picture seemed to be crisp and clear as usual but unusually stereoscopic where instantly I noticed unnatural depth of field which made my eyes tired just after few minutes of watching. This is the same effect when short sided person gets the glasses with bad eye pupillary distance. To eliminate or confirm gear issue I replaced the disk with three other 3D movies I watched in the past: I Robot, Avatar and Prometheus. All three confirmed there is nothing wrong with the gear showing perfect picture as usual without any eye related discomfort.<br /><br />I put back the Hobbit disk and the problem came back. I had to actually change the viewing distance and get further away from the screen to the back wall of my projection room to make viewing acceptable. This is very unusual move because so far the distance from the screen never mattered and watching 3D movies from any distance or any angle was always enjoyable without any flaws or discomfort.<br /><br />I followed the observation path of unnatural depth of field, and I have noticed that the actual amount of L-R picture shift is dramatically different comparing to other three movies I mentioned above.  The easiest way to check it is to turn on subtitles and check the relative shift between L and R frame by looking at the subtitle letters with the 3D glasses not used. I noticed that on Hobbit the shift is far greater comparing to other movies and this made confirmed my observation about unusually large depth of field on entire picture which could cause my eyes discomfort.<br /><br />Despite of the above, with apprehension and viewing discomfort I managed to watch entire 3D movie to the end. But I was disappointed that the actual BD transfer is bad and causes my eyes tired for the first time I watch 3D movie. Among many others I own, this is the first one and probably the last one in the Hobbit series - at least in 3D version.<br /><br />I  took a time and played 2D version disk and the picture was perfect, natural although two-dimensional. This is going to be version I will probably enjoy with upcoming episodes of Tolkien Hobbit released on disk.<br /><br />I am just not sure how come director allowed releasing movie based on flawed transfer or authoring. The only explanation to this would be this was intentional. Not good for me, probably for some viewers either.ar greater comparing to other movies and this made confirmed my observation about unusually large depth of field on entire picture which could cause my eyes discomfort.<br /><br />Despite of the above, with apprehension and viewing discomfort I managed to watch entire 3D movie to the end.

B000VYX8PE|4.0|The bad beginning, is a very good book about three children with very bad luck. The book is full of detail, and great story ethnic. Unfortunately this book is not a five star book, firstly, I have read better. Secondly this book is not happy, and nothing really good happens to these kids. This book would be better if at the end everything turns out right!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston (#9) is arguably one of the best Doctors in the series - a very close second behind David Tennant (#10). Love the action and story line in this season, not to mention the Brit humor!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|If you looking for a family oriented movie, this would be the one to sit down with.  I watched it twice.
0345803493|5.0|The story continues and the characters develop into people who are real...like the people next door.  Interesting and colorful story.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Good movie for children and adults who are not looking to see vulgar activities.  If you are into syfy you will enjoy this movie.
0345803485|5.0|The story begins a bit slowly, but picks up momentum quickly.  The characters are complex and the story line takes some quirky twists.
B00BHMF578|4.0|For me this was a good movie, but not great. I like Ben Affleck and he has had some great movies(Pearl Harbor) and some not so great. It is worth watching, but for me not purchasing.
0345803507|5.0|Good finish to the trilogy.  The story line takes some interesting turns and the characters are very believable. Riveting tale.
0425263916|5.0|This book has SO much more to it than meets the eye. You will drop this book out of shock, surprise, whatever at the end! It's THAT good. Gideon and Eva are quite the pair. This book can be so many things, it's brilliant. The author is SO intelligent and do yourself a favor and go to the forums on sylviaday.net to uncover things that you missed. There are so many questions to be answered and I cant wait for the 3rd book! Please let there be a 4th!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it is a must have application. so fantastic to save notes when I want and it is very easy to work with
140591243X|5.0|This book shouldn't really be linked in with the other romance books out there...and i love them, too..but these books are different than those. It is INTELLIGENT,a sweeping love story, romantic (soooo romantic!) and, the best part....SPIRITUAL! What all the other books are missing entirely. It really spoke to me.<br /> The parts in the church?! Wow. Just Wow. I cannot wait for the 3rd book. Fingers crossed for a baby?!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A good read, easy to understand, and quite a bit to think about,.. for me,  a non medical, non religious man
0425263908|5.0|Really well written and I could NOT put this down and it had my stomach in knots for the first 100 pages. To say I can't wait until the 3rd book would be an understatement. I LOVE these two.
B00AR83PN4|3.0|I get an error message when trying to download. So have been unable to use the product. Would like to be able to use the product.
030758836X|3.0|Read this for my book club. First few chapers where very thrilling. But the last 2 felt like author got tired of the characters and some how wanted to finish the book off. Just as mentioned in previous reviews, key evidences that cops can use to get the girl caught was not even mentioned.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Not a bad book. I think the author tried a little too hard to fit everything into his paradigm for cue routine reward (and craving), and I thought his example classifications were often a stretch. Informative, with a few ok tips for trying to reform habits, but not as helpful as I had hoped or expected. Easy read.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|A great service, and you can't beat the price.  After downloading the app to my phone and the sotware to my PC's , I find the service to be very  intuitive. I recommend this product.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it.  It is a game that is fun for all ages. I got this for my daughter but ended up playing it more than her! If you like horses and games this is one for you.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Perfect for that 10-13 age group, not too little kid, not too teenage.  Entertaining enough for the grownups, too without an awful lot of eyerolling.

B003I55BIA|5.0|HIGHLY recommeded! Love the classic bad boy meets good girl but with a twist! Could not put this book down! Loved the story and like the characters.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Quite an amazing literary accomplishment.  I wasn't sure if I was reading fact, fiction or fantasy.  At the end, I realized I was reading all three.  The center of the book is the saga of Pi and the tiger adrift at sea.  Compelling and then confounding but never dull.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing, I didnt want it to ever end! The story was amazing and I loved the characters. I did not want to ever put this book down. This book has made my all time top five! I have re read it several times and it is still as good as the first time I read it. HIGHLY RECOMMEDED!
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great read and full of surprises.  Definitely worth your time to read this SciFi classic.  Transports you to a time and place beyond today.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fans of Vince Flynn will not be disappointed. It seems to be an easier read than some of his previous novels but none the less exciting and accurate.
1609611543|5.0|Seriously the best purchase ever! Who would've known! I can't believe all the things I'm learning in this book......it has helped me so much letting go of Gluten!
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I am such a big fan when it comes to magic and stuff. My friends and I watch this movie over and over again.
B00008RV1L|5.0|It would be hard to find a more scathing indictment of the 1980s than \\"American Psycho.\\" You know, that book about the murderous yuppie.<br /><br />And if anything, the movie is even more wonderfully brutal than Brett Easton Ellis original book -- a scathing, unnerving movie that swings between savage violence and hilariously sick social satire. But what really makes it work is Christian Bale, who is utterly perfect as the titular American psycho. Every smile, snarl and twitch from this man is utterly perfect.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman (Bale) is the perfect yuppie -- he has a high-paying job and a beautiful fiancee (Reese Witherspoon). He dines at all the best restaurants and goes to the best clubs. He keeps his body, New York apartment and wardrobe in perfect condition, and gives detailed descriptions of his designer clothes, beauty products and music collection.<br /><br />But when his associate Paul (Jared Leto) flaunts a business card that is superior to Bateman's, it sends him into a psychotic rage -- first he kills an old man and his dog, then he cheerily axes Paul to death. A detective named Donald Kimball (Willem Defoe) investigates Paul's disappearance, but doesn't seem to connect Bateman to the man's disappearance despite his many lies.<br /><br />As the days roll by, Bateman's homicidal urges begin to spiral out of control as he kills more and more people, descending deeper and deeper into his own bloody madness. Will he finally be caught for his crimes, and will his insanity finally swallow him up?<br /><br />It sounds like a cliche, but \\"American Psycho\\" is all about the emptiness of a life without real substance. Every part of Patrick Bateman's life is carefully chosen for the image it gives him. Within that shell of material wealth is a howling void, and the only thing that fills that soul-destroying emptiness is hate, rage and violence.<br /><br />But Mary Harron doesn't preach to you. She starts the story off relatively quietly, following Bateman around his everyday life -- only interrupted by brief explosions of violence (\\"I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood\\"). But as the movie unfolds, the story becomes more gruesome -- and more surreal. By the finale, the world has been warped into a bloody funhouse mirror where nothing can be trusted.<br /><br />Consider: an ATM demands that Bateman feed it a cat... and he does. He manages to kill a prostitute by FLINGING A CHAINSAW DOWN A STAIRWELL. And he cheerfully dances through his apartment in a tidy raincoat, babbling about music right before he axes his nemesis in the head.<br /><br />Christian Bale is scarily brilliant in this role, in the way that only the best actors can be. Not everybody can play a psychotic this perfectly. Reportedly he based his performance on Tom Cruise, and I can see that -- Bateman greets the world with a friendly voice and a shiny smile. But his eyes are cold and empty, except when the rage and hate begins to well up behind them.<br /><br />And yet... and yet Bale still manages to make you feel vaguely sorry for Bateman every now and then. He's insane, empty and seems to yearn for the human connections he only knows about through songs. He's pitiable, freakish and terrifying.<br /><br />\\"American Psycho\\" is wickedly funny, surreal and gruesome -- and Christian Bale is utterly sublime as a psycho that nobody seems to recognize.

B009JLADJY|5.0|We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now. No movies show that as perfectly as Christopher Nolan's \\"Dark Knight Trilogy\\" -- three movies that explore the formative years of the legendary superhero Batman, from the beginning of his crusade for justice to the explosive climax. Even people who aren't into capes and tights can appreciate this story.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\": After his parents' murderer is paroled, young bazillionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanishes on an aimless journey across the world. He's taken under the wing of the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to train him to be a member of the League of Shadows. But then Bruce learns that the League plans to annihilate Gotham, his home city.<br /><br />Gotham has become rotten to the core with mobs, crooked cops and a fear-inducing shrink. Using the company's discarded prototypes, Bruce fashions an armored bodysuit and tanklike vehicle, and uses them to fight crime wherever he finds it. But the League still has plans to destroy Gotham, and the only one who can stop them is Batman.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is feeling pretty good about his battle against crime, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. Even worse, he has the ultimate way of blackmailing Batman into doing what he wants: holding all of Gotham hostage.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight rises picks up eight years later -- crime is almost gone, Batman has vanished, and Bruce Wayne is a recluse. But then a terrifying masked man named Bane arrives in Gotham, attacking Batman as revenge for the League's destruction. He will turn Gotham into a living nightmare, unless the Dark Knight can rise again...<br /><br />Most directors would have given these movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in \\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.<br /><br />But since this is a comic-book movie, Nolan peppers them with kinetic action, high-speed chases and massive explosions. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (\\"That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people\\",\\" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.<br /><br />The most striking part of these movies is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature. He heaps more tragedy and trauma on Batman than just his parents' death, and delicately traces the moral boundaries -- or lack of them -- between Batman and his foes.<br /><br />Christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others. Michael Caine is awesome as his faithful butler/father figure, and there are solid backing performances by Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman.<br /><br />And the performances of the villain actors are absolutely brilliant. Everybody knows of the late Heath Ledger's spellbindingly chilling performance as the Joker, a casually corrosive creature who believes himself to be the yin to Batman's yang. But Tom Hardy and Liam Neeson are also brilliant as cunning, clever people who are determined to destroy Gotham.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that Nolan isn't very good at casting women. Maggie Gyllenhaal and the pouty Katie Holmes are both hideously miscast as the cruel, manipulative Rachel Dawes, who treats Bruce's heart like a toy. Anne Hathaway is the best of the bunch -- a pretty baffling choice as Catwoman, but she does a decent job.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\" contains some of the best superhero movies ever made -- a dark, gritty, richly-imagined tale of one man's quest against chaos and evil.t job.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\" contains some of the best superhero movies ever made -- a dark, gritty, richly-imagined tale of one man's quest against chaos and evil.

0517543052|1.0|from a graphic design stand point this book is a disaster. the vertical layout used in half the book makes it difficult to read especially with print getting lost in the page fold.<br /><br />the actual content of the book is  your basic \\"New Age\\" cliche of non- christian philosophy (Tao , Hermes Trismegistus, Buddhism)  under the influence of intoxicants.<br />\\"we're all on the same trip\\"<br />\\"Cosmic consciousness\\"<br />\\"back to the beginner's mind\\" etc. etc.<br />it's popular. it's been around for a while. The reading will seem familiar, like you 've heard it at  every yoga studio and burning man- type festival.<br />but its not deep and not all that serious. don't take it too seriously.

0812550757|5.0|I love this book and recommend it with Ender's Game. It blows my mind that there are so many cool ideas within this book that have yet to be incorporated into modern trendy scifi genre.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|The rules are minimal and easy to understand. There is some strategy involved, but it doesn't require too much concentration. Gameplay can be short, especially if you only have a few players. I would recommend this game for those new to tabletop gaming, families, and social gatherings. Those searching for a game with more involvement, strategy, and critical thinking should continue their quest elsewhere.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I read the book after seeing the movie. though i thought of it as seeing the movie again..... it felt quite different. its a totally breathtaking journey of a boy from pondicherry to his story of survival and friendship to the majestic bengal tiger on a life boat. i personally sugges everyone to read it as well  as watch the movie.
B000FC130E|5.0|Nothing better in the world then a story by Mr. Gaiman .  He always delivers the best . This story is a winner.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This movie is entertaining and helps us appreciate the talent and dedication of the people who helped found our country.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly think I like this game better than Temple Run and TR2, I've had this since september and I still haven't gotten bored with it yet. It's similar to temple run except you dont tilt to move, you slide your finger.... and there are multiple levels (heights), connect with friends through fb, daily sign in bonuses, better power ups, good missions, alot more characters, diferent boards to choose from, and the whole 'mystery box'..... the best part of the game is when the setting/theme change with the updates (Halloween, Christmas, Rio, etc.) .... my only complaint is that I wish you could get the score multiplier past 30
0060723513|5.0|Very good story couldn't put the book down until I finished. Gives you a good message.<br />Fast service and delivery.<br />Would recommend this site.<br />Didn't enjoy Mutant Message from Forever as much as this one.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this series. Grab it and read it for yourself. You will be glad you did so.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A fine job of acting by Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Fields.  Steven Spielberg's direction is up to his usual standard of excellence.  After watching I thought it was unfortunate that the movie could not be several hours long and encompass far more of the book than it did.  I recommend this motion picture to everyone.
B006YW6KX4|1.0|Was supposed to be an 'All Region&#34; Blu-ray, however my region B (Europe) Blu-ray player cannot read it. Very frustrating...
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Fabulous!  I wake up in the morning singing the songs and I replayed the movie right after the first one was finished.  I am so very happy that I rented this movie.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Kept me riveted until the last page and then ....  I am still dwelling on Nick and Amy and where they are now. I sometimes wonder if they are so very different from any other couple.
B006ZZANDI|5.0|My best friend was obsessed with them and she was very happy to get this! It came very fast and was packaged very nice and everything was lovely.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|this game is not so hot because. it is ok because the graphics are good but it isnt because it wont let me turn!
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|Sweet mystery! Ended a little abruptly though. Already bought the second in the series, looking forward to the developing romance between Lexy and her neighbor.
B0063IH60K|4.0|On kindle fire -  Fun to play as always. App seems to work well. This is a good time passing game.
B0095P33IW|4.0|There were good effects and action. Story line matched what I followed as a kid. It led well into the next movie. Worth the watch.
B0086700CM|4.0|On kindle fire and iphone-  Fun to play as always. App seems to work well. This is a good time passing game.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Reads like a an elementary school book. Guy is very full of himself, and the book is laced with his self serving account.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written. It's obvious this is a first for the author. I don't get what all the fuss is about and find it odd that people compliment the writing style. It would have been a decent book had I been able to get past the sentence fragments and incomplete thoughts.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This book wass written by a very talented author.  Loved it because it was good reading.  Sorry to have the book end.  Thats how good it is.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game had me going for hours because it's one of those games that so simple to play, yet it takes good visualization skills. I like to map it out in my head before tracing any of the lines.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|A great read.  I love old english stories, the wealth and high society stories.<br />This was so written and so complicated, with so many characters.  Kept me on my toes to know who belonged to whom but again the auther had the ability to keep you interested and tied in the Pride and Prejudice piece theme.  Another great classic.
B0063GORYU|4.0|On kindle fire - typical spider game. Runs good and hasn't crashed. It's a good time passing cards game but I won't spend hours playing it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I had always heard about the Sherlock Holmes books but had never read them for myself.  Kept my interest and didn't bore me.  Good suspense and kept you guessing; &#34;who did it&#34;.<br />Highly recomend this read.  Good for the imagination too.
B009O2XY12|3.0|On kindle fire -  Fun to play as always. App seems to work well. This is a good time passing game.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This is a great program. I highly recommend it to others to watch and I recommend the CD, really good actors and vocalist.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|On kindle fire -  Fun to play as always. App seems to work well. This is a good time passing game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading the entire trilogy. The information the epilogue provided at the end of book 3, I think, should have been placed somewhere else in the storyline.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|James seemed to pick up some better writing styles in this one. However, it was still poorly written. I don't understand why this is a best seller  - probably because people like me buy it to see what the fuss is about.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie grabs you from the first scene. The story is great, the acting is wonderful. The scenery just takes your breath away.<br />Fantastic movie.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I read this series because I wanted to see the hype. Honestly, they're poorly written with many sentence fragments. How was that not caught in editing? Book 3 was worse than the rest especially because of this and the writing style seemed to change half way through. Ok smut read, but nothing to get your panties in a bunch (or off) over.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have been using this app since early March and have not had a problem. It's easy to use and like very much the feature that tells you the time that you have left for listening to music watching videos etc. I definitely recommend this product.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|On kindle fire - I don't know what, but it felt like it was missing something from the original computer version. Maybe I was playing it wrong, but I couldn't figure out how to buy individual items and gave up after 5 minutes and deleted game.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Worst ending to a series I've ever read. Depressing with no resolution. No happy ending that wraps things up. Disappointment.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|On kindle fire -  Fun to play as always. App seems to work well. This is a good time passing game.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This show is a definite pick you up when you're having a bad day. Loved that I could watch it on prime!

B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have this on my kindle fire and it works great. Doesn't seem to crash like it does on my iphone.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Needed something to transfer photos to the ipad on a trip from my digital camera and this fit the bill and works perfectly.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|On kindle fire -  Fun to play as always. App seems to work well. This is a good time passing game.
B002N9MK8G|3.0|I don't really like this CD and I am a huge Sinatra fan.  I guess you had to be there.  I like his studio recordings much better.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This was an okay movie. It had it's moments where I was laughing/crying but there were also many long lull periods. I get the family guy references - I'm a huge fan - but I didn't find them funny....or even amusing. And all I could think of most of the time was Stewie and it got kind of annoying.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|The picture on the back of Nick Hornby's An Education contextualizes the central fight, for me, of the screenplay. David, Jenny, and Jenny's parents are standing in their living room. David is looking at Jack with soft yet deliberate charm. Jack is looking at David with a father's evaluation. Jenny is looking at her father uncertain, but surprised, about what's happening. Jenny's mom is looking at David, smitten. Which man is the right man: David, with his savoir faire, or the sensible, fatherly, Jack?<br /><br />David's character is understandably attractive to Jenny: he has a sports car, knows the best night clubs, goes to art auctions, takes trips to Paris, and uses charm instead of hesitation. Jenny's dad is, well, her dad.<br /><br />David's image is largely from the trappings of wealth, and the screenplay lends itself to an argument about a man's character and the source of his money, but I don't think it's a good one. There're certainly ethical issues: some theft, and real estate deals taking advantage of buyers who don't know any better. But a person can make money in questionable ways and be tortured by it. David's not tortured, though he's not a villain, either.<br /><br />Hornby based this screenplay off a short story memoir. It's invention on top on invention on top of a real story, then. Jack and David were deliberately created for the screen, and they seem to characterize William James's self esteem equation. James says a person's self esteem is accomplishments divided by pretenses. A person can increase her self esteem by increasing her accomplishments; though, he argues, it's easier to do so by decreasing pretension. David seems to have that ratio backward: his self esteem comes from pretense.<br /><br />And that's probably because he doesn't care about anything. The only moments he seems to be a man are when he's walking up to a door to con somebody. It's an Instagram image: deriving character from the image of doing a thing, instead of doing something meaningful. David comes across mature when he gives off the image of doing work.<br /><br />This is sharply contrasted by Jenny's father. He's dull, risk averse, and cares about his daughter. In some cases he comes across uncultured and suburban, but, more often, he comes across as a strong father. What's important, though, as in a lot of cases, is what's unseen. Jack was once young. Presumably he had the same self certainty that most young people do, and the interest and know how of city life that David does. Jack became Jack. It doesn't seem he was forced to. Growing, for him, was natural, and had a strong element of choice.<br /><br />Much of this movie is built on conversations and how they take place. A person who can connect in conversation has a certain degree of substance. Jokes and charm can be distancing. At the end, David and Jack have to talk to Jenny. It's uncertain whether David lies to Jenny when he says he loves her and wants to divorce his wife. And there is indeed logic to waiting a day to talk to her parents. However, while doing so will let some air into the situation, it also puts immediate burden on Jenny, because she has no choice not to see her parents. It's a matter of character, then, to talk to them the same night. He has to, to save her.<br /><br />A man gets only so many chances to prove his character. Eventually, he has to grow up.
0439882826|5.0|Bought this as a gift for someone who is a SW fanatic. He really liked it. It's a nice gift for any age as it is something that can be used for child entertainment or make a great addition to a collectors shelf. Very well illustrated and put together and the interactive light sabers are a great addition.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love all the Harry Bosch novels. I can relate to where they take place and can picture his running around towns looking for the bad guy. Keep them coming!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I had all sorts of problems from trying to open the game to trying to run it and play it. Couldn't get anywhere on it

B003PIUC02|5.0|my husband loves this series and has enjoyed watching this movie great christmas present and he is enjoing it much
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It was more time consuming to access the games than what it was worth. So it got deleted shortly after
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book was right on par with the hunger games and divergent. I can't wait to read the sequel. It was amazing
B000L3CHC0|5.0|This is a replacement since my first one was stolen after wearing it once.  I liked the watch so much I bought another to replace it.  It has kept the time very accurately so far.  It's a substantial watch.  If you want a thin watch this is not it.
0062127241|2.0|If you are a fan of the Who don't bother reading this book. The information about the Who and stories behind the songs are severely lacking in quality and substance. Pete Townshend is a legendary songwriter, but has no idea how to write a book or properly elaborate his thoughts.<br /><br />If you are interested in the teachings of Meher Baba and are fascinated by the numerous extra-marital affairs of a rock star, this book might interest you. I also wonder if he receives compensation every time he references Doc Martens footwear. I would have been less dissapointed if the book was billed as a Meher Baba/Doc Martens infomercial.<br /><br />I still love the Who, but I will have to look elsewhere for detailed insight about one of the greatest rock bands ever.
B00006JSS8|5.0|It's great collection, older songs sung by a younger Stevie that bring back memories, followed by the more adult and stonger voice of a great singer and an oustanding harmonica player!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Wonderful cinematography, visual experience and story idea. But it was overextended, unnecessarily drawn out, and could have used more depth or complexity.
B00980IA3M|2.0|I've got to agree with my friend Bill about the lack of merits of this box.<br /><br />There are many better choices that could have been made for inclusion in this box set. Why not include Karajan's Parsifal or Ring on DG? In fact, it's strange that no Karajan recordings appear in this box when he was THE DG conductor for decades and his Wagner is very highly regarded. Oh, wait - it must be because Karajan still commands full price in the marketplace (his DG Parsifal goes for $48 and his Ring goes for $125), so why would you include them in a budget box such as this?<br /><br />Inclusion of the Levine/MET Ring has me thinking that DG is still trying to recoup the investment they made in this Ring. It's been repackaged and resold already at a budget price and here it is again. Reiner Goldberg is nobody's idea of a Siegfried, the cast is more variable than other Ring casts (while featuring no singers in any role who could be considered to be \\"the greatest\\" in their role), and while the chorus and orchestra are quite good, a Ring missing great solo singing isn't really worth the time and effort.<br /><br />The inclusion of so many Domingo recordings is clearly a sop to people who don't know Wagner but have heard of Domingo. The fact is that of the four operas here featuring Domingo, he has sung only Lohengrin on stage, IIRC. His inexperience in the roles shows to me, and while his Walther in Meistersinger does display some nice earlier-in-his-career singing, he basically muscles his way through Erik in Hollander and - to a lesser extent - through Lohengrin and Tannhauser as well.<br /><br />I see the set is now being offered for $67. Perhaps at that price it's not outside of the realm of possibility for completists. But the fact that it's discounted so heavily from its list price of $144 tells you something.

0316228532|3.0|I am still trying to get through the book. It is character-heavy. I am a fan of the author but think she should stick to Harry Potter.
0300169787|5.0|What drew me to this book was the amazing cover, it has a photograph of fashion guru Alexander McQueen but when you turn it to an angle you get a three dimensional skull, really an amazing feat.<br />Sad that this fashion genius took his own life at such a young age before he even neared his peak, but the book captures so many of his phenomenal designs.  They are a mix of the old and new, and there are printed quotes that are sprinkled throughout the pages. The design contains animal influence and McQueen is quoted as saying, \\"Animals... fascinate me because you can find a force, an energy, a fear that also exist in sex.\\"<br />This beautifully larger photographic collection of his works is incredible. With a pretty good synopsis beginning of this fashion designers life in the end you are able to read an interview with Sara Burton, creative director, Alexander McQueen written by Time Blanks.  Take an opportunity to study the fashion from Alexander McQueen who was influence by the pop world around us.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book and the movie. Will purchase the movie when it comes out. Would recommend both, first read the book then watch the movie!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I saw an interview done by Ms. Moorjani on television.  Everything she said resonated with me regarding healing.

B009KEN87O|5.0|Great throwback game. It is a kindle version of Galaga. While the graphics are simple, the game itself is great and hard to put down.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I absolutely loved this very dark comedy and I found it even better than \\"Shawn of the dead\\". Below you will find more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS included.<br /><br />Tucker and Dale are uneducated but hard working blue-collar people living in a backward area of West Virginia. Best friends since always and best friends forever, they are of course very different - Tucker is more assuming, better spoken, more handsome (or less ugly if you prefer) and somehow more succesful, when Dale is shy, complexed, overweight and in his own opinion a total looser.<br /><br />The story begins the day when the two friends decide to go on a vacation, to work on a \\"vacation home\\" Tucker just bought, which is situated in the wild woods, near a lake. The \\"vacation home\\" is in fact an abandoned, dilapidated ruin, surrounded on every side by a vegetation gone completely wild. But Tucker and Dale never feared hard work and they are very enthusiastic about the task which awaits them - and they also expect to spend some really good time drinking beer, fishing, drinking beer, playing board games and drinking beer.<br /><br />But there is also a second group of people who came to spend some summer time on the other shore of the lake - they are college students, six guys and three gorgeous girls. One girl in particular will play an important role - her name is Allison (Katrina Bowden) and she is an incredibly beautiful and sexy creature (think about young Denise Richards and you will have an idea).<br /><br />And then, as it is this kind of film, there is also, unavoidably, EVIL, which in this film comes mostly from misunderstandings, stupidity and prejudices, but is greatly amplified by a growing insanity which affects one of the characters.<br /><br />The confrontation between the two likeable hillbillies, the nine college kids and the EVIL produces a wonderful, albeit by moments very gory and pretty cruel, comedy. This film is so filled with incredible dialogs, memorable one-liners, great slap-stick scenes and other delights, that at the end I could hardly believe that it lasted only 85 minutes! And from the first minutes to the very end I laughed so hard that tears were flowing from my eyes and my ribs were hurting. I was laughing like a hysterically drunk hyena who is fighting madness and loosing - in fact at one moment my wife and daughters panicked and came running to check on me because they thought I was dying!<br /><br />Although it is not absolutely necessary to enjoy this film, it can be useful to remind yourself the (in)famous \\"Deliverance\\" movie. If you never saw it, try at least to read the synopsis and try to find on the web THE scene from the film, the one with Ned Beatty and the two hillbillies... You may also want to rewatch the first of \\"Friday the 13th\\" films and have at least a look at the trailer of \\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\\". But once again, this is not absolutely necessary.<br /><br />I loved this film, I am very happy that I bought it and this DVD is definitely a keeper.

B000PC0S5K|5.0|There are no bad books written by Eckhart Tolle.  The wisdom contained in these pages is right on.  I've recommended his books to many people.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|Oh, sorry, this is Edward Grey, not Christian! In the aftermath of [[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades]] the world of D/S has become a tad more mainstream. This film does a wonderful job of walking the fine line between satire and psychological thriller. These are not two people playing with a spanking or two, far from it. She has a history of serious problems with cutting, among other things, and is the last person who should be playing with the submissive role to a strange lawyer who has a penchant for domination (this is not play, folks). The sense of danger is palpable in every frame, and you are never sure if and when this dangerous liason will spiral out of control into something far more dangerous, even life threatening. Maggie Gyllenhall is absolutely perfect as the secretary who gets what she needs, and perhaps more, balanced on the edge of a precipice that could lead to madness. James Spader plays this as well as Nicholson did with \\"The Shining\\"...the comparison will be clear when you se the film. I could not take my eyes off the screen as the spring tightened, and I suspect you will feel the same. Be clear, though, that this is not a play ful romp, far from it. It is a psychological thriller not a sex tape.<br /><br />For a slightly more edgy take on D/S from 1986, see Kim Bassinger and Mickey Rourke in the classic [[ASIN:B002HFWBUI 9 1/2 Weeks (Original Uncut Uncensored Version)]]. By the way, there are several versions, some edited, so if you wish to see and judge the real thing, be sure to get the uncut version.

B009YP9L7U|2.0|Just a fantasy. Hard to believe circumstances. People just do not do things as suggested in this story. Reminds me of a Cinderella story.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. I get the controls perfectly and I enjoy playing this one and the sequel.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very fast paced murder mystery with a twist. (of course)  Good depth on characters.  Plot develops as expected...most of the time!  Loved reading this book, it was ordered by accident as I was setting up my new Kindle, but glad I did.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|With the smoky voice her fans have come to expect, Madeleine doesn't disappoint when she covers songs from Ray Charles's &#34;Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music&#34; from 1962, adding numbers by Buddy Holly, Warren Zevon and Leonard Cohen.  It's a real treat with songs for all ages.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  Unbelievable story and a must read!  Gillian Flynn, an exceptional writer.
1451695195|5.0|I haven't finished reading this book yet, but so far I am loving it!  It really makes you think about what is on the other side.  I am a Christian, so I already believe in the afterlife with God, but even for those who are just curious I feel this is a good book to answer questions you may have about life after death.  Definitely worth buying and reading!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is literally the pinnacle of Monty Python's work, meaning its full of farcical puns, outrageous situations, and snappy dialog.  The movie chronicles the adventures of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table as they seek the Holy Grail, hampered by killer rabbits, mad troll bridge-keepers, and VERY obnoxious Frenchmen.<br /><br />This is a movie you can't &#34;get&#34; all of in a single watching, and you'll want to watch it over and over to catch all the side-gags the troop slips in along the way.  Definitely worth the money and your time!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is cool. It works well and looks good. I don't have a whole lot to say about it. It's the classic solitaire game for your android.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|First and foremost, let me say that this movie is an EXCEPTIONAL film in all respects.  It tells an engaging story, and is visually stunning from beginning to end.<br /><br />This movie is based LOOSELY on JRR Tolkien's &#34;The Hobbit&#34; which was the original book upon which the Lord of the Rings trilogy was based.  The book is a light-hearted, child-friendly tale about a meek halfling who is unwittingly thrust into great events through the intervention of Gandalf the Gray.<br /><br />The movie starts with quite a bit more back-story, and takes a lot of liberties with the history of Middle Earth.  It's also MUCH darker, with significant realistic violence and the introduction of serious story lines (like the rise of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur) which are only hinted at in the book, or like the introduction of Azog, which was made up whole cloth, I can only guess in an effort to stretch a shortish book into three feature length films.  As such, this is not a film for small children.<br /><br />But that, and the fact that the Dwarves are too short and their beards are an insult to all of Durin's Folk aside, this is simply an exceptional movie, and a must have for your collection.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Needed more development of primary characters prior to onset of illness.<br />A well written fable of the plight of the mentally ill.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is a non-fiction book that reads like a novel. The author introduces us to 6 North Koreans who were able to defect from the totalitarian regime. Through their stories, the reader gains an insight into the horrors of the lives of the North Korean people. Especially now with threats from that government, it is a great book to read to understand the torment of the people and the despicable actions of a government to their citizens.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Great game for when you're bored or just taking a dump. I wish it was a little longer. Otherwise it's great.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|This is a movie for anyone who has ever wanted to be in a blockbuster action movie, and the writing is impeccable. Pay close attention, because almost every small joke or reference you see in the movie gets brought back in the last 20 minutes. A comedic masterpiece.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Good movie but a bit violent for kids. I thought my 3 year old would like it but she is way too young for this.
034580404X|5.0|I don't usually read romance and erotic novels, but I had to see what all the fuss was about. Once I began reading the first book, I thought that it seemed interesting enough, but nothing exciting, but then it got better and I was hooked! The cliffhangers and major drama moments kept me on the edge of my seat and I just had to read on to see what happens. E.L. James has a way with keeping you hooked and wanting to see what happens next even though you have to stop reading because you're out of time. I stayed up until 5am on multiple occasions getting lost in the book!<br /><br />I won't get into the ins and outs of the plot because this review will be much too long. The story has the feel of a well-developed soap opera with all sorts of twists, mysteries, secrets, and drama. This is an erotic novel, but it's not one intimate encounter after the other for the entire duration of the three books.<br /><br />It was an interesting read and I had fun reading it.

B000WC39ZY|4.0|It's amazing what a few years of living can do to your perception. I saw this film in a theater in 1977, and again in the mid-80s when it was reedited and rereleased, and both times it left me cold. I thought Scorcese--one of my favorite directors--had jumped the track with his weird attempt at a musical. Now, almost 30 years after the last time I saw it, I got this 2-disc set from Amazon, thinking I'd give it one more try. And boy, was that a good idea! This isn't the movie I remember at all! But, of course, the movie hasn't changed--I have.<br /><br />Scorcese is very interested in film history, and this film was his attempt to fuse the past (old-time big screen musicals like [[ASIN:B000I3SVXC 42nd Street]] and [[ASIN:B0090XLDKY Singin in the Rain]]) with the 1970s present (gritty, realistic character studies like his own [[ASIN:B000286RP2 Mean Streets]] and [[ASIN:B000R8YC18 Taxi Driver]]), using the artificial old style to comment on the dark new one, and vice-versa. The hopes and dreams of the two main characters are contrasted with their grim reality, and we get a vivid idea of what they're experiencing. Minnelli was a perfect choice--she'd just done [[ASIN:B009NYF2GQ Cabaret]], which used the same contrast idea to great effect, and our inevitable memories of her mother's movies (particularly [[ASIN:B003B3V0X4 A Star Is Born]]) helped sustain the illusion. De Niro is fine as the brooding, conflicted antihero, and his fake-playing in the musical scenes is very impressive. The big musical numbers and the painful, sometimes violent \\"book\\" scenes are a jarring combination. Together, they give us a real feel for the time and place of the story. Is it a complete success? No. But it's worth seeing, anyway.<br /><br />I love Scorcese, mainly because he's one of the few directors who always take chances. His films don't look like anyone else's--he has his own definite stamp--and Hollywood is one place where individuality should always be encouraged. Let's just celebrate his vision, even here in NEW YORK, NEW YORK. It's not his best film, but it's a fascinating one. Recommended.e his vision, even here in NEW YORK, NEW YORK. It's not his best film, but it's a fascinating one. Recommended.

B009K0P10K|5.0|Students of politics should love this series. Game theorists should too. Actually even ordinary mortals will love it. Although the title is Revenge, power is at the center of every episode. Understanding that power can be defined in terms of its resources, the principle resources in this instance are information and secrecy. It is no surprise that Amanda Clarke (actually Emily Thorn) is dead and Emily Thorn (actually Amanda Clarke) is still alive, although she has come through some close scrapes. It is the secrecy that has saved Emily from the ongoing maliciousness of the Graysons. Clarke was \\"out\\" and Thorn was still in the shadows. Of course with the aid of Nolan Ross, a low key tycoon and cyber wizard, Emily (actually Amanda in the shadows) is able to have access and opportunity to observe the mischief of the Graysons on their laptop, and watch the ongoing chicanery unfold. By remaining in the shadows they are able to toy with various Grayson endeavors. The tone of the story is superficial civility masking underhanded, backstabbing and ruthlessness. Even murder is in the vocabulary of malicious action for the Conrad Grayson, but Emily is a martial arts practitioner and capable of pointing a gun and squeezing the trigger herself.  Emily (actually Amanda) keeps score by recording an \\"X\\" through the  faces of pictures of her targeted foes stored in a box of \\"keepsakes\\" under her living room floor as she embarrasses or inflicts damage upon her targets. I love this series for its intricacy of the game. I once had a college professor tell me that a characteristic of great art is that it lacks immediacy. This seriously meets that test. There remains much enjoyment on subsequent viewings. I have watched both seasons at least twice.
B0087EACJK|3.0|The original Continuity game was really great - combining action and strategy seamlessly. This sequel, however, keeps pretty much all the gameplay, waters down the strategy part with the \\"coin\\" thing, and adds gravity - an idea already well explored in indie games.<br /><br />If you haven't played the original game, Continuity 2 can give you some (but not quite) taste. Otherwise, better leave this alone than to damage the good memory of playing the old one.

B009Z59ZNE|4.0|Like most recent viewers of this BBC trilogy, I really enjoyed the Netflix series, and I was curious as to see what the original version was like, and what future awaits Kevin Spacey's Francis Underwood.  I really enjoyed the original version, and found it much darker, funnier, and ultimately more provocative than the American re-birth.<br /><br />Ian Richardson is the devil incarnate as Francis Urquhart, chief whip for the ruling Conservatives.  The age of Thatcher has come to an end, and when FU (as he is affectionately known in the tabloid press and by his loyal subordinates) is slighted a cabinet position he mischievously and morbidly undertakes a campaign to undermine the new Prime Minister.  In his mischief, he is aided by a naive but ambitious young political reporter with a daddy complex as well as a press secretary with a cocaine problem.  The parallels to the Netflix version are immediate and obvious, and it's interesting to compare and contrast the two series.<br /><br />By season two, FU has ascended to the PM position, and he rules essentially a one-party state dictatorship that now and then offers a chance to the people to vote for the one party.  State surveillance is widespread, and everyone is spied upon, especially FU's main adversary -- the newly ascended king, who has issues with how FU, his cronies, and their ilk are getting rich at the expense of the British people.  He begins a tour of compassion, a word that makes FU both disgusted and contemptuous, but also a word that finally forces FU to act.  Season two is immensely watchable, but it is also macabre and outrageous -- and I suspect that David Fincher will choose to depart from the \\"To Play the King\\" storyline, and chart another course for his Netflix series.<br /><br />While season one and season two were both immensely watchable and compelling, season three is neither.  By now, FU is firmly in control, and we are tired of him killing people and creating all sorts of mischief and getting away from it.  Once a funny, irreverent, and mischievous villain is now just an old fart, and the stakes are not just low but irrelevant (honestly, who cares what happens in Cyprus?).  Whatever creative juices and animus Michael Dobbs had in creating the House of Cards series of books is now gone, and what's left a story that just needs to be ended.  And it finally does end, and it ends like it always does -- with FU getting his way, and escaping the justice that he deserves.<br /><br />The House of Cards is a relentless indictment of the British political system, created by a man disillusioned and disgusted by Thatcherism in the UK:  the greed, the oppression, and the brutality.  Of course, things have gotten only much much worse in the UK, and we can only wonder if the Americans with have the courage and the audacity to go as far as the original BBC series.

B007UZO3F6|5.0|With a little apprehension, I decided to purchase the Shuttle SZ77R5. There seem to be a few reviews that state it either works or dies right out of the box. Seeing as how I've wanted to build a SHuttle XPC for several years, I made the purchase as my intention was to put some decent hardware in this box to replace two aging computers. I was going to install an Ivy Bridge i7-3770k, so the bios issue was on my mind. When the machine arrived it had the latest (at the time) bios, which meant my Ivy Bridge worked just fine. It's been running flawlessly since I put it all together in late Jan 2013. You can hear the fan, but only slightly. The end result looks like this:<br /><br />i7-3770k (applied with Tuniq TX-4 thermal paste)<br />Kingston HyperX Black 16GB (2 x 8GB)<br />Samsung 830 128GB SSD<br />Seagate 2TB HD<br />Generic DVD-RW<br /><br />Running Prime95 and monitoring thermals with RealTemp, this computer never gets within 20C of maximum temperature running the Shuttle I.C.E.<br /><br />At the end of the day I am happy with the purchase.

Not only has it withstood my cat crawling through it, laptops casually dropped on it and an uneven desk situation, my new apple trackpad also fits nicely in the vacant space under the laptop stand and the stand keeps the cat from sitting on the trackpad when I'm working!  Even better, the lucite bar in front of the track pad acts as a cooling wrist wrest for my arm.<br /><br />So not only is it an elegant design, but it is pretty much perfect!

B002A32HTC|5.0|As is implied by my name, and for those of you who have read any of my previous reviews, I am a \\"hold over\\" from the 60's and classic rock era.  I was weaned on The Beatles and followed them collectively and  individually from Ed Sullivan to insult song exchanges, to assassination, to cancer, to \\"memory almost full\\".  I was a 60's folk rocker and space cadet, a 70's classic prog-rocker, an 80's wave rider and retro rider, and in the 90's the ground fell out from underneath me.  What was there to find in the 90's which was not a continuation of the old dream?  What was not either continued vigilance with long time partners or addiction to new names with an old paint brush (DMB, Sting, Melissa Etheridge, etc)?  I was living in Europe at the time and a dance drub was predominant.  In Bristol England a new sound was emerging.  I don't care much for hip hop, never have, but Massive Attack was making inroads with the \\"older\\" generation, others like myself who were put off by the techno wave but could hitch onto the \\"trip hop\\" element and the jazzy croonings of Sade.  If you had an instinct for jazz, outside of rock and folk, like I did, Massive Attack sounded, well... good!  Safe From Harm and their ode to the brilliant William DeVaughn by covering Be Thankful For What You've Got was a perfect attraction to the oldies but goodies mind set.  This was all cool but it was still as close to the new music as I was willing to get.  Still there was nothing really \\"new\\" and fresh and exciting.  Until Portishead.  I didn't even notice Geoff Barrow's name in the Blue Lines album credits until way later...<br /><br />This review comes very late, and almost apologetic.  I was one of very few Americans to take initial hold of [P] in 1994.  This only by luck of circumstance, I was in Europe and the Bristol Beat was the new craze.  But [P] were not fond of that notoriety, they were not fond of being called \\"trip hop\\", and they didn't give interviews, and getting them to provide a video to MTV, even in Europe, was like pulling teeth.  [P] is the perfect band for the descendants of, and the aging of, the counter culture.  Their music is like nothing else.  Oh that's not to say there weren't immediate copiers (another thing which drove Beth Gibbons and Geoff Barrow utterly mad), there were, and those fans who couldn't get enough [P] would go so far as to settle for the second rate Morcheeba in order to at least have an imitation of the sound.  It still was not what set [P]ortishead apart.  My generation understands [P] completely.  They are Beat.  They are Poet.  They are Hallucinogenic.  They are Film Noir.  They are dark and mysterious and as alluring yet frightening as the depths of Mordor.  Using modern hip hop techniques of sampling and scratching and drum programming, they used down beat and the ancient art of melancholia to create an altogether new yet nostalgic sound.  In these waves of subverted pseudo cabaret torchiness you will find, no \\"feel\\" Lalo Schifrin, Weather Report, Eric Burdon & War, Isaac Hayes, and Johnny Ray!  They are all laid out right there in the grooves, it's in the mix.  And stretched out over the flimsy parchment of drub and nostalgia samples are the crooning's of a torch song diva who could belt out Janis Joplin like the mistress of song herself, if she wanted to.  She used to do that when she was found by Barrow in a bar.  Now she writes her exegetic beat poetry in mystical song and stabs us with it.  Geoff and Beth are essentially [P] but a third permanent member is critical to their sound.  Adrian Utley was a phenomenal jazz guitarist working with Blue Note artist Big John Patton and also with Art Blakley's Jazz Messengers.  How Geoff and Beth were able to lure him into [P] is rather much a mystery, but the mystery is [P]erfect for [P]ortishead because his unique atmospheric playing and often times James Bond guitar riffing completes the band in a huge way.  So what exactly IS Portishead?<br /><br />Aside from a seaside port city, 8 miles west of Bristol, a logistical key in the UK dating back to Roman times, Portishead as [P]ortishead is dream-like states, always just out of reach, smoke-filled bars, dark recesses and menacing corners, gothic melodrama with a femme fatale in shadows and fog.  To describe [P]ortishead is like trying to explain beige to a blind man.  Their music is a confluence of film noir Rita Hayworth crooning, psychedelic 60's, downbeat-backbeat 90's, and elements (previously discussed) of hip hop but far removed from any of these things when the sum of the parts becomes the whole.  To say they are like Massive Attack and the Bristol Beat (even though they are a part of that movement) is as true as saying they are like Bing Crosby or Ella Fitzgerald.  Emotionally they are torch-song material, thanks to Beth's incredible voice and delivery.  Lyrically they are impressionist beat poetry descending from Rimbaud and Bob Dylan but not Ginsberg.  Sonically they are enveloping, dark, pre-Raphaelite, slow drubbing to mid-tempo, The Doors gone trip-hop.  Utley plays all the guitars, from Bond low register to classical jazz accents and heartbeat Bass.  Beth croons, paints black and white surreal images, cries out in angst, and plays the piano and acoustic guitar on tour (on studio albums she just provides vocals and goosebumps).  Geoff is the everything else man.  He engineers, programs, plays keyboards, turntables, even drums when needed (there are studio session drums and keys credits occasionally to other personnel).<br /><br />Of particular note is that [P]ortishead uses decidedly low-fi effects to give their sound an unusual appeal.  This is digital age music, but with artificial injections of retro feeling.  For instance, sometimes Beth Gibbons will affect that classic Rudy Vall&eacute;e singing I'm Just a Vagabond Lover through the megaphone sound in spots (The Beatles did this with Honey Pie on \\"the white album\\" and Queen with a few songs on A Night At The Opera).  More noticeable though is the warmth given, in a loving way, of making [P] albums sound like old records by providing a \\"scratchiness\\" with occasional pops and snaps on the CD as you listen.  The scratchiness is low key, never annoying, but obvious and it adds a dimension to the recordings which is once again, a trademark of their \\"sound\\".<br /><br />Listening at home is one thing, especially on a high-end stereo in a candlelit room, but beware of playing [P] in your car unless you have one hell of solid system.  Even Boston Acoustics with their fine bass units will shake the foundations at the lowest end of the spectrum.  There is a pervading bottom end to [P]ortishead which you can literally feel in your gut and it is not found on any other recording group, but in your car, it will transmit itself to all cars around you and if your vehicle is not solid, pray the upholstery does not peel.<br /><br />Dummy is the first debut of [P], I have been listening to it since late summer 1994 and to this day it is in my top five \\"modern era\\" albums.  This group is extremely shy, reclusive, and tight-lipped.  They literally take years in between albums, the last gap was 11 years between studio albums.  They have one of the best live album concerts (on DVD even better) ever made, with The New York Philharmonic orchestra augmenting their peculiar sound (Roseland NYC).  Dummy is still my favorite of their 4 (so far) albums, and remains the most popular of the buying public.  It is best listened to as a whole CD from start to finish uninterrupted as I think this was intended by the entire structure of the album.  Those of you who have listened to Portishead songs individually and who like (or love) what you hear, will truly love Dummy.  The best word to describe Dummy is haunting.  It is dark and esoteric. The few who \\"get it\\" will be enraptured.<br /><br />A few words more on some highlights of the album may provoke the reader.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a descentinto a maelstrom called \\"Mysterons\\"; thanks to an infectious snare drum, a science fiction movie soundtrack theremin warbles in and out of the crevices, Adrian plays a guitar riff rent from the grooves of Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow, and in same fashion Beth dissolves Grace Slick to a plaintive moan on greed and lust and punishment.  \\"Inside your pretending, Crimes have been swept aside, Somewhere, Where they can forget, Divine upper reaches, Still holding on, This ocean will not be grasped, All for nothing, Did you really want?\\"<br /><br />Sour Times clangs keys like a James Bond back-alley in Moscow or old East Germany, sampling Lalo Schifrin (The Danube Incident).  Beth croons \\"nobody loves me\\" and Adrian plays Bond guitar melded with Ennio Morricone spaghetti western riffs.<br /><br />Wandering Star is bass and drum nightmare of shared grief and cruelty.  Beth delivers in spades: \\"Those who have seen the needles eye, now tread, Like a husk, from which all that was now has fled, And the masks, that the monsters wear, To feed, upon their prey.\\"  Wandering Star bridges the verse gaps with portions of Magic Mountain by Eric Burdon and War, the resulting track being a brief glimpse into an inner hell, and yet the song is provocatively beautiful and sad.<br /><br />Roads just may be the most perfect composition and recording by [P] in their career.  A soft and beautiful Rhodes piano protest ballad, hauntingly plaintive and pleading, when Adrian's echoing wah-guitar accompanying his string arrangement compliments Beth, you WILL get goosebumps!  And quite possibly tears... \\"Ohh, can't anybody see, We've got a war to fight, Never found our way, Regardless of what they say, How can it feel, this wrong?\\"<br /><br />Biscuit is entirely built around Johnny Ray's weeping \\"I'll Never Fall In Love Again\\", the instrumental bridges and his vocal refrain slowed down into the netherworld.  Beth (as in most of her songs) never really divulges the meaning of the title \\"biscuit\\" but you can sense it is bite of something she wish he hadn't eaten.  It haunts her and enslaves her now, \\"Fully fed yet I still hunger\\".  The Johnny Ray samples are rendered into a frightening spectre, Geoff spins him back and forth like a newly discovered musical instrument and the last finish fade out will stick with you like an unnatural glue.<br /><br />If you have never heard Glory Box before, prepare yourself.  This is Beth's theme song, her version of the torch-song, a woman scorned, but this woman might just be a hellish cupid.  You be the judge.  A search at YouTube will easily turn up the original video for the song, tastefully made and it actually provides a little insight to what [P] are all about.  But the sound issued from YouTube is nothing like the sonic adventure provided on disc.  There is a surprise low end which will sneak up on you and punch you physically, this is Beth's punishment to men and women.  Glory Box rebukes both genders with old fashioned metaphors and modern talismans.  Ultimately this is the proper ending for Dummy, the tales are spun and by now you should be ensnared in the web.  Beth may be \\"tired of playing... with this bow and arrow\\" but the tempteress will enslave you!  If you have listened to Dummy all the way through, if you made it this far, you are most likely a huge fan by now.  This is not fruit to be eaten lightly.  Savor the moment, you may not get another.<br /><br />This then is [P]ortishead.  And if any of the old mates known as [P] Heads are reading this, I wish you all well, this is ZardoZ signing off!More noticeable though is the warmth given, in a loving way, of making [P] albums sound like old records by providing a \\"scratchiness\\" with occasional pops and snaps on the CD as you listen.

The few who \\"get it\\" will be enraptured.<br /><br />A few words more on some highlights of the album may provoke the reader.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a descent into amaelstrom called \\"Mysterons\\"; thanks to an infectious snare drum, a science fiction movie soundtrack theremin warbles in and out of the crevices, Adrian plays a guitar riff rent from the grooves of Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow, and in same fashion Beth dissolves Grace Slick to a plaintive moan on greed and lust and punishment.  \\"Inside your pretending, Crimes have been swept aside, Somewhere, Where they can forget, Divine upper reaches, Still holding on, This ocean will not be grasped, All for nothing, Did you really want?\\"<br /><br />Sour Times clangs keys like a James Bond back-alley in Moscow or old East Germany, sampling Lalo Schifrin (The Danube Incident).  Beth croons \\"nobody loves me\\" and Adrian plays Bond guitar melded with Ennio Morricone spaghetti western riffs.<br /><br />Wandering Star is bass and drum nightmare of shared grief and cruelty.  Beth delivers in spades: \\"Those who have seen the needles eye, now tread, Like a husk, from which all that was now has fled, And the masks, that the monsters wear, To feed, upon their prey.\\"  Wandering Star bridges the verse gaps with portions of Magic Mountain by Eric Burdon and War, the resulting track being a brief glimpse into an inner hell, and yet the song is provocatively beautiful and sad.<br /><br />Roads just may be the most perfect composition and recording by [P] in their career.  A soft and beautiful Rhodes piano protest ballad, hauntingly plaintive and pleading, when Adrian's echoing wah-guitar accompanying his string arrangement compliments Beth, you WILL get goosebumps!  And quite possibly tears... \\"Ohh, can't anybody see, We've got a war to fight, Never found our way, Regardless of what they say, How can it feel, this wrong?\\"<br /><br />Biscuit is entirely built around Johnny Ray's weeping \\"I'll Never Fall In Love Again\\", the instrumental bridges and his vocal refrain slowed down into the netherworld.  Beth (as in most of her songs) never really divulges the meaning of the title \\"biscuit\\" but you can sense it is bite of something she wish he hadn't eaten.  It haunts her and enslaves her now, \\"Fully fed yet I still hunger\\".  The Johnny Ray samples are rendered into a frightening spectre, Geoff spins him back and forth like a newly discovered musical instrument and the last finish fade out will stick with you like an unnatural glue.<br /><br />If you have never heard Glory Box before, prepare yourself.  This is Beth's theme song, her version of the torch-song, a woman scorned, but this woman might just be a hellish cupid.  You be the judge.  A search at YouTube will easily turn up the original video for the song, tastefully made and it actually provides a little insight to what [P] are all about.  But the sound issued from YouTube is nothing like the sonic adventure provided on disc.  There is a surprise low end which will sneak up on you and punch you physically, this is Beth's punishment to men and women.  Glory Box rebukes both genders with old fashioned metaphors and modern talismans.  Ultimately this is the proper ending for Dummy, the tales are spun and by now you should be ensnared in the web.  Beth may be \\"tired of playing... with this bow and arrow\\" but the tempteress will enslave you!  If you have listened to Dummy all the way through, if you made it this far, you are most likely a huge fan by now.  This is not fruit to be eaten lightly.  Savor the moment, you may not get another.<br /><br />This then is [P]ortishead.  And if any of the old mates known as [P] Heads are reading this, I wish you all well, this is ZardoZ signing off!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games the kindle has adapted for the os it runs perfectly. Only the ads are a bit of a bother but perfect
0316228532|1.0|I *so* wanted to love this book.  I *so* loved Harry Potter.  Well, truth be told, I liked the early books in the Harry Potter series.  The later books got increasingly dismal, complex, and bogged down -- and i liked them less, tho I read them to find out what would happen.  I resented Rowling for making the later books so dismal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book continues the dismal trend.<br /><br />At least, in Harry Potter, there were characters who I liked, who I could get attached to.  Here, no, everyone is unattractive, so far as I can tell.<br /><br />Somehow, I had gotten the idea that this book was a murder mystery.  I kept reading up to p. 119, waiting to hear that it had been discovered that the dead man was murdered, rather than merely dying of a brain aneurism, but, so far, at least, no such announcement has appeared.  It's just an exploration of people's reactions to the death.<br /><br />So why am I writing a review at p. 119, when the book is much longer?<br /><br />Because I just can't stand it any more.  I can't read another page.  It's too dismal.  The characters are too revolting.  I don't want to know what happens to them.  I just want to shut the book and not hear any more from them.<br /><br />Perhaps I will miss something this way, but I doubt it.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|I loved this movie, kept us on the edge of our seats. It had a way of making you think something entirel different.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this apps every day. It's very helpful when I do cross word puzzles. Also has some great games that makes you use your brain.thanks for a great apps.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched the movie for the first time in the theater and enjoyed it just as much on my Kindle.  The plot is very realistic and captivating and the makeup artists deserve a lot of credit.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Classis Groban.  He's never disappoints!  He has a golden voice and the songs he chooses to sing really showcase his talent.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|When you click the on/off LED button on the right, the flashlight app says &#34;Your camera is busy, perhaps another App uses it&#34;.  Then if you click on the same type of on/off button on the top (screen), you get a white screen which can light up a small area in front of you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a great way to pass the time for any age. colorful and lots of fun. There are different levels for all ages. I'm not really into games but can't seem to put this game down.
1435122968|4.0|I don't buy very many books but when I found this one, I had to get it! It's such a great collection from a well known author. I love H.P. Lovecraft's stories. The only thing bad about this book is that the about the author page is gone at the very end of my book.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|great game! Best I have ever played! bb f v v v c d f g h h n vg cfr xdesxx jbhh Xxx Xxx Xxx Xxx Xxx ( wasting space)
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|Network is a tribute to the eyes of the producers who in 1976 were able to foresee where television was heading. They almost imagined what was to come. They were not spot on however because what has and is coming across the airwaves is worse than their imaginings, though nonetheless prophetic.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Another great show from AMC.  Starts slow through about the 5th or 6th episode into season 2, but then really kicks it into high gear.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest allows me to share my thoughts using pictures. it also resembles an actual bulletin board because you are &quot;pinning&quot; photos on the &quot;board&quot;. i love it.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Very unusual movie, enjoyed it very much, and the scenery & colors were great, plus the story was out of the ordinary
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I used this fan as a replacement fan for my [[ASIN:B00342UT84 TowerSTOR TS2CT - 2 Bay SATA to USB 2.0 / eSATA / 1394a / 1394b RAID Enclosure]]* which had a 40mm fan. The fan comes with a fantastic set of accessories including different mounting screws, noise adapters and parts to splice in the connector to your existing fan.<br /><br />Although a little loud with no low noise adapters on at full power, it's extremely quiet and powerful when you use the low noise adapter.<br /><br />My RAID case used be louder than my computer and now I can't even hear it unless I'm on the floor with my ear to the case. Even then I only hear the hard drives spinning.<br /><br />*Please note that not only is the original fan hard to get out (it has tiny nuts instead of being screwed in), but the connector to the board is totally different. I picked up a \\"micro 3-pin connector\\" on eBay for a couple bucks and attached it to the low noise adapter as I didn't want to damage either the original fan or the new one. I do not recommend doing this to the TS2CT unless your warranty is expired.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I'm no audiophile by far, but compared to a set of much more expensive Audio Technica headphones I had, these provide punchier bass and crisper vocals.  I was very impressed.  Construction and comfort  is not quite as good, but seems adequate.  So far very pleased.<br /><br />Update.  They're getting better with time, and I can hear new details on songs I've known for years.  It's really opened up a whole new aspect to old music.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved the history involved in the story and especially enjoyed the stories of the characters. Wonderful
0307120007|5.0|this has been his favorite book so far. This is the only book that doesn't get old and he gets better and doing the touch and feel as he gets older.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I watched the first and second seasons at least 3 or 4 times because the stories are terrific and the acting is stellar. I haven't watched this set yet but I watched the shows for season 3 on TV and online about 3 times. This season made me angry that with the cast changes (don't want to be a spoiler alert for whoever hasn't seen this yet) but I still love the show and can't get enough of it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use it daily and find it an excellent source of keeping in touch with friends and relatives.  Also, I love uploading pictures and seeing other peoples pictures and sayings.  I like that it connects with Pinterest and other special interest websites.
1936608898|5.0|This is one of the most complete and comprehensive books I've read on nutrition. If there is only one book that I could recommend to someone it would be this one. Matter fact I bought 6 copies and gave them out to family members and friends. It was the third book that I read on this subject. The first was Wheat Belly then I read Practical Paleo. Both good books as well. What I like the most about this book is it provides a complete step by step process in which to base your future eating habits. It may seem extreme to most people(including myself) however once you complete the Whole30 you are free to make conscious decisions about how and what you choose to eat. I now feel confident in my day to day food choices good and bad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest.  It has been a wonderful source of ideas and recipes.  We had a wedding for my daughter last fall and  used several ideas from pinterest in the wedding.  Great recipes that we have also used.  Love it.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I chose the product because of it multi functionality and reviews. Now I understand why this is such a popular product. It's very well made and seems to be q good quality case to protect my Kindle Fire. I picked the purple color and although, it's a little darker than the one shown, the color is really nice. Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase and will probably recommend this company to anyone looking for a good, stylish and high quality case.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I say ok, because there is one part of Draw Something with my Kindle that is not as great as my draw something on my smart phone.  And that is the choices of words to draw.  I like having more choiecs  of words to draw like my smart phone has  My phone has category choices of words at the bottom listed below the three major choices at the top if I don't like them.  Plus with both instruments there is not enough variety of words to draw - the same ones come up all the time over and over.  I have stopped using it as much because the words are too repetitive.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|really entertaining and a different view on all of the characters. great family movie for those with elementary age kids
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Read &#34;The Lacuna&#34; by Barbara Kingsolver,  and came highly recommended.<br />Also, Salma Hayek is a marvelous actress and did a wonderful job portraying Frida Kahlo.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Lauren Oliver followed perfectly with this sequel. The plot had a delicious depth, something that I thought Requiem lacked a smidge. However, in Pandemonium, Oliver delivered a fantastic story with an ending that left me on the tips of my toes, aching for the next book in the series.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I really liked this game ( and it might help that I hot it for free) except the updates slate terrible!!! they think that placing huge bodies of water is an upgrade? my cabin, my cattle, my farm, my pigs, and my yard is under a foot of water!!!
B000UAFDP2|5.0|Great movie. I love the sartastic take on the military.  Think of this movie as a prequil to the book. The second movie leaves much to be desired.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I ask how to use app and they tell me nothing but jokes like roses are red.I don't like this app at all
034580404X|2.0|Well what can I say.  Everyone was raving about this book so I took a chance and ordered the set...
B0063M22QO|5.0|Colors are bright and clear this game is fun and relaxing at the ame time. I would definitely recommend for the casual game player.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|Awesome movie! This movie is hilarious, Tom Hanks is such a good actor. The DVD itself is missing additional bonus material but I love the movie. 5 stars on the movie but overall a 4 for features.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I would recommend to all couples. To live in love, passion, intensity or just exist and become another number in a stat. Your choice.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This is just okay. I do not find it very entertaining for more than 5 minutes. It was free at the time.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One of the most creative ways to enter a narrative I've seen in a long time.  Pat Rothfuss is able to create a main character who is complex, sympathetic, frustrating, and enviable...all with a first name that's unpronounceable.<br /><br />One of the best books of the last 20 years.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|I chose this book because I have found KF to be a good writer. You always learn something while your reading. This book did not disappoint. It was also fun to read about current history. I was in hs while this took place.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Hershey bar in Florida and Michigan in the snack bar and I herd of China and it is snowing and Michigan in Ohio joyride to south Carolina plan backfired and I am hungry and it will be a account for about this page bookmark the permalink comments vote up vote down
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Words can't express the emotions that I am feeling right now after reading this book. So powerful. I am speechless it was so good. I don't want to give anything away so I don't really want to talk about the story but if your looking for a great book, emotional and unpredictable, than this is your book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I find this series wholly addictive. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; or series of that ilk.<br />The Brits have done it again.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'm a great fan of &#34;Les Miserables&#34;.  I've seen all the different versions that is available, including the Broadway and Boston musical shows, as well as the 10th year concert on VHS/own and watch the 25th concert on PBS as well as the non-musical version movie.  Each version is appreciated, including the 10th Anniversary Highlights C,D.  We needed to go and see the movie when it came to our local theatre.  During the movie, I was anticipating  and comparing the big screen version, that we needed to go a second time, and just enjoy.  I'm so happy to own a copy of &#34;Les Miserables&#34;, that now, we can watch over and over and appreciate this fine musical performance.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Great read on ways to better approach work. And no reason most of these tips shouldn't cross over into life as well. A great reminder that businesses are made up of people. Be a person first; your business success will follow you.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Very good choice;an excellent musical work of this ax member of The Band ! I wish a new Work of this artist soon.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I liked the choices. I wish it had a timer and that it would run in throw background without shutting off.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love this series.  I rate it up there with &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;.  The characters are realistic and have depth, not just cardboard people.  The action is intense and the interactions of characters equally engaging.  And season two gets even better.  Can't wait for season three to start in June.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|If you're even considering it, then buy it.<br />It's the Foo Fighters.. All their songs are awesome.<br />Make sure you buy the cd that sends songs to your cloud!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved every minute of these DVDs. I wish the seasons were longer and not just 7 episodes, though... However, it´s a fantastic series and I am already looking forward to the 4th season!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|So many tracks on this album remind me of MJ from the 80's and that's just killer!<br />Treasure, Moonshine and Natalie are hits that i hope hit the airwaves soon.<br />I'm not big on the one Rastafarian track towards the end and thats the only one. He's such a good singer.<br />If you want to hear MJ reincarnated on some new tracks, don't even hesitate. Really good stuff
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I liked the characters, the development of the story and the twists and turns of a good plot. Looking forward to reading Child's Jack Reacher series in order, much like Connolly's Harry Bosch stories!
B003ITDN86|5.0|I haven't heard these guys in years until Pandora pumped them into one of my stations.<br />This CD has a solid mix of their more punk songs and their softer side. I wish it was more like the CD &#34;Does this look infected&#34; since I loved every song on there, but this one is good too!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Difficulties and how they are dealt with in teenagers are portrayed much more realistically than the movie &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; which was awful.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Love that I bought the CD new and it went to the amazon cloud. The CD is okay, it reminds me of the Beatles making CD's while on LSD. Pusher Love Girl and Mirrors make this CD worth the purchase
B005K17RU0|5.0|I rely on this app since the latest update.  It's fast and gives me all the information I need for planning my day.  Living in Oklahoma where the weather can change drastically in a matter of minutes, the hourly conditions are vital for arranging outdoor activities.  I love the format of the new update and it's been impressively accurate.
B008VBYN80|3.0|The game is good. Lots of fun. Just wish it had less issues with social connections and with the game itself.
030758836X|4.0|Loved this book!  Kept me turning pages until the end.  I read that Gillian Flynn did not write the ending of this book in order to later write a sequel, but if she does - I will buy it in a heartbeat!
