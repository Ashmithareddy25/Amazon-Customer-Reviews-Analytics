B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a blast. It was particularly so for me since I'm old enough to remember even the first text only computer adventures and spent lots of time (and quarters) in video arcades. I think the believable characterizations, suspenseful plotting, and thoughtfully constructed near-future story milieu offers plenty for readers who didn't grow up in the '80's. It's one of those rare stories you wish you could read again for the first time.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is my second purchase from G5 Entertainment.  G5 games are the best.  Fun,  thought provoking and good graphics.  I wish the price was cheaper or maybe have a sale every now and then.  G5 games are worth every cent.  Don't stop G5.
B006CHML4I|4.0|this is a nice watch, but it has to be wore every day to keep it from stopping so I bought another one that has manual wind.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This product is beyond amazing. After receiving it extremely quickly, I rushed to assemble this wonderful collector piece. And its all that you could dream of and more. The ONLY complaint i have is that the BluRay case is rather difficult to get out of the slot in the back if placed too deep in it. I had to pry it out with scissors but I think ill leave it out of the tank case and just keep it with my other dvds. Overall a perfect product, and it really looks amazing. A must have for any fan of zombies and the Walking Dead.
1401324649|4.0|Unusual characters, entertaining plot.  One of the most interesting creative books I have read.  Which makes it, a book that you recall when someone asks if you have read it.
B00E9A656K|1.0|The reason I don't like this game is cause you only get one chance to beat the boss to win his car you should be allowed to at least restart.......
B000B8L6LI|5.0|Wish it was faster, but you can't get a truer edge, or a sharper knife, unless maybe you have a laser to sharpen it with.  This kit doesn't have the smoothest stones, but they can be picked up extra.
B007C94QRK|5.0|Fantastic!  Very entertaining for all ages.  Has a great soundtrack and superb acting.  Some of the characters are a little fuzzy!
1554072840|5.0|My  just turned two daughter loves this book more than any other potty book.  we haven't started training yet,  but she likes to read this several times in a row and she calls out the girls body parts and understands there is an \\"oh, no!\\"  when she accidentally goes on the floor.  We  change the names of the body parts and act of going to sit our family.
B0044RFTD8|5.0|This is a charming movie that the Grandchildren watch over and over.  It is very colorful, animated and teaches a life lesson about the role bees play in pollinating flowers and plants . . .
0316322407|5.0|Amazing story of a young girl in Afghanistan. Recommended it to middle school students for their autobiography project and many loved it.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I am a big amazon customer, but after reading this, maybe a changed one.  First, this was a fantastic book.  Very well written and touches on topics deeply enough that its interesting but doesn't dwell on anything too much.  Regarding learning about Amazon - it was tough to learn that one of my favorite companies was both an un-pleasant place to work, for most, but engaged in unethical yet legal business practices.  Jeff himself was similar to Steve Jobs in creating a difficult work environment and was genuinely feared and, from my take, not very well liked by employees.  Of course, his PR makes him seem like a funny likable guy when in reality he was hard, mean and treat some close friends very poorly.  At the same time, all this is done to give customers (like me) a wonderful online experience and low prices - Amazon is clearly insanely customer focused.<br /><br />I liked this book mostly because it served as an insight into Amazon, but it also covered many different business and management tactics.  I found it both a non-fiction piece but also a good management primer for different management styles.  Unlike Jobs' book, this wasn't just about Jeff Bezos - it was about how amazon ruthlessly crushed publishers and retailers - how they built an amazing world class supply chain - and how they keep it all managed.  There is plenty about Jeff, however.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Amazon, this is definitely worth a read.  If you are a manager (or an aspiring one) this is good insight into business practices and management styles.  Amazon is a ruthless competitor.  I would not recommend this style for everyone but it is good insight in how brutal you need to be to get where Amazon is in less than 20 years!  Some of the examples may make Gordon Gekko blush.
B00BJEPR8G|5.0|Highway 61 Revisited is Bob Dylan's profile album. Containing all the sorts of material he wanted to make and all the sounds he envisioned. Dylan takes the opportunity to lash out against others in &#34;Like A Rolling Stone&#34; and lash out against the wild fanfare and press that followed him around in his early years in &#34;Ballad of A Thin Man&#34;. This is the obsessive, resentful and fun Bob Dylan that was dwelling deep inside. Al Kooper joins on organ and really defines the mood of the whole album, while Mike Bloomfield joins with some real stoney and radical guitar licks. &#34;From A Buick 6&#34; and the title track get real bluesy and show off some of Dylan's most surreal lyrics while the 11 minute closer &#34;Desolation Row&#34; takes on an intimate portrayal of the world. In Highway 61 Revisited Dylan really sheds his skin and is looking to lose listeners. The music is deviant and tempting, the lyrics are surreal and in your face and the overall tone is one of playful delight, yet, in doing so Dylan has created some of the most captivating songs he would ever make. Fortunately, this album would be followed by his masterpiece &#34;Blonde On Blonde&#34;, meanwhile this album will tear out your ears and make you rethink your position in the world. Be sure to checkout &#34;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&#34; , the highlight of the album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive, don't play it... 500 levels so far. I do wish that you could earn free games when you pass each level.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|This is a very different album from The Suburbs and other Arcade Fire, but after several listenings I've decided it isn't nearly as radical a departure from previous albums as reviewers have indicated. It's certainly much more rhythmic, but has the same feeling of child-inside-adult-body that Arcade Fire so greatly conveys. Check out It's never over and Porno, which almost sound like one song. They're my favorite.
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|After Mr Clancy's death my husband was a little upset but when I saw that there was a new book coming out I bought for him
B005LAIGP0|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  Daniel Radcliffe is phenomenal.  This is absolutely a must-see movie.  I definitely recommend it.  You should buy it.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|This is quite a fun game. I picked it up as a free app of the day. It has plenty of in app purchases, but you can advance just fine without them. I am however suprised to see the ads in the game. And very suprised to occasionally see them pop up in the middle of a fight. Not cool. Overall I enjoy the game. Wish it had some Steet Fighteresque combos, but alas it does not. Pretty mindless. Block, counter, repeat. But still enjoyable. With some very minor tweaks, this game could be amazing. Not going to hold my breath as these games rarely evolve much beyond the initial release and I know this one has been around for a while.
B005NACYQU|4.0|Enjoyable book with interesting references to mythology. Slow in places but good character development and engaging storyline. Would certainly recommend to others
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I missed the first 2 seasons and have just loved the ones I've seen so this was a perfect solution to catching up.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham, reviving some favorite characters (ie- Jake Brigance, Lucien Wilbanks, Harry Rex Vonner, Sheriff Ozzie Walls, the Honorable Judge Rueben V. Atlee and even Willie Traynor) made one my favorite literary worlds of Clanton, Mississippi come back to life;a true treat for Grisham fans everywhere.  An exciting read that left no lose ends to tie up...As a matter of fact, in addition to nothing left to tie up, once more he delivered a book that was difficult to put down!
B003097ABA|4.0|You can't complain when you get all the great Cars discs in one small package. Doesn't waste space on the shelf and costs less than buying Panorama on CD by itself! Be aware that each CD is in a cardboard sleeve not a jewel-case.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Really like Denzel but this is not his best, mostly due to a predictable script. Just a few too many of the same old &#34;fighting my demons&#34; scenario's for my taste.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Tis a fun little game for me and son. It moves a bit fast for son but he is learning quick
0618154248|5.0|We bought these board books for my son's second birthday, and he absolutely loves them. The stories are creative and fun, and captures his attention even when he is wound up and not ready for bed. We've read them almost every night since he got them (at his request) and we don't even mind the repetition because the stories are so fun. It is hands down one of my favorite gifts we've ever purchased for him!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app because u can post anything anywhere and at anytime  app is amazing and so is pinterest because you can heart pics and all kinds of other stuff I recommend you get this app
B001AVCFJM|2.0|STRONGLY suspect this is a bootleg copy of the star trek movie. The package had the DVD w/ digital copy details &#34;super glued&#34; to one side of the package and the special addition 2nd DVD's holder was broken ...leaving the second DVD to flop around unceremoniously against the rest of the package. Still, for $3.98, can't complain TOO much--- you get what you pay for.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love all the ideas it gives me. Food recipes, crafts, gift ideas, holiday decorating ideas, a little of everything, enjoy
B007MDB71O|4.0|One of those movies that didnt do well in theaters yet anyone you talk to who has seen it loved this movie. We had been looking around for awhile and saw the deal on the Blue ray and DVD combo and had to buy it! love this movie!
0792846710|5.0|Best Movie ever in the history of the world- if you don't know then you better get yourself a copy and find out!
B00BSBR9N6|3.0|I really enjoyed the premise of this book!  I read it in three days (it was a fast read), and I was fairly interested in the outcome throughout.  Even though the ending was slightly predictable, the author stayed true to the main character's personality.  I was afraid that the slightly autistic-seeming (we never do find out an accurate diagnosis, but perhaps this is because, in the end, it doesn't really matter to Don) Don was going to suddenly change into a highly emotional human being, which didn't happen (thankfully).  Also, I appreciated the glimpse I got into the mind of someone who is highly pragmatic in his approach to life.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give it more stars was because the storyline was not overly complex.  It was written in a linear fashion (one event happens after another) with very little insight into any of the characters, aside from Don.  I believe the author did this with intent since Don is a highly practical person, but I still found myself wanting more.  Perhaps I would've enjoyed it better written in the third person.  Overall, I really enjoyed this book.  It made me think about how we approach life and how our emotional sides dictate so many of our decisions.  The ending was a bit \\"tie it up with a bow\\" for me, but I suppose it left me satisfied.  I wished the author would've spent just a bit more time developing the ending so that it wasn't so perfect.  Perhaps a brief point of view from Rosie would've really helped!  That would have been so interesting to me!
B000QRIGLC|3.0|I can see why they made this into a movie. The battle was very well described. What a gripping account.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The reason I gave this book 5 stars is because of the emotional response I had to it while reading.  I loved the relationship between the main characters, and I never wanted to put the book down.  I have a family member who is a paraplegic, and this book allowed me just the tiniest glimpse into how difficult his life must be since his accident.  I am grateful that this book is out there.  It is a chance to us to really feel how our lives would change should our basic physical functions be taken away from us.<br /><br />Although the premise of the story sounds dark, the book was surprisingly bright and positive.  Again, I loved the characters and would recommend this book to anyone looking for a truly touching (love) story.  I read it for book club, and it sparked some great conversation!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Fantastic mouse for the price and its features. Great for gaming and it's accurate.<br /><br />However I am docking 1 star because the side buttons seem to be of inferior quality as it rattles. Also that the mouse is built for larger hands. I have a medium size hand and I find the mouse sometimes can slip.<br /><br />Overall for the price, I would recommend it. And the customer service is phenomenal. They have a personal touch when it comes to customer service
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|great movie.  super entertaining.  great message.  sends a very positive message of acceptance of others, work ethic, and taking on responsibility.
B002VT6C0K|4.0|When I read the first story - I thought I would not like this book!  But as I read more of the stories - the book just grew on me and I found myself looking forward to the next story.  This Author has a wonderful way of telling stories that is very captivating!  Give yourself a chance to read all of the book! Excellent
B005FPT51K|4.0|I give the ibaby four and not five stars only because for some reason, I can't always connect to the camera when I'm out of the house, which was the whole point of buying the thing in the first place; I wanted to be able to spy from wherever I am.  I suppose it could be my wireless network but I have another older ibaby for my other child and don't have the same issue.  So my powers of deduction lead me to believe it's the camera.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This is a true scary movie.  Good old fashioned kind with no blood, guts, cursing, sex, nudity or slicing and dicing.  Been a VERY long time since I've seen one like this.  LOVED IT and have already told friends about it who then went out to get it for themselves.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|To judge this product is to understand it: This works as advertised: It will play content from Netflix, HuluPlus, etc. So if you don't have a DVR cable box built after 2003, and you don't have cable service that supplies OnDemand, or if you don't have a DVD player or if you don't have cable or dish service period, but have access to WiFi this is a great product for you. So if all you have is a tablet or laptop, with no DVD player, and a TV, and WiFi, then you can pay for and stream TV and movies that everyone each is watching as part of their package. If you don't have cable service, and went to Vegas for the weekend, and pay the $9/month for HuluPlus, then you can sit in your room and watch TV, if they offer free WiFi, else you'll have to pay for that. The reason for the low score here, is that they do not display or indicate the huge USB power cable that sticks out the end of the Chrome Stik. Nor do they tell you how playing movies through your Chrome App player will start the movie, but if you close the app or browser, the movie keeps playing....you cant stop it without unplugging the Chrome Stik. The other option is to let it play until it finishes, and I honestly don't know what happens there. This product is a very niche tool, that is in fact rather cool, but that is not how its being marketed. But the reality is, if you only had a laptop or iPad to watch your Hulu, then you could buy a $4.95 cable to connect and display on your TV. This let's you do it wireless, but also restricts you in your content. Lose/Lose
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game just stops when trying to visit neighbours. It is frustrating plus all the dragons that are really rare cost money if you do not have 2000 gems or more. What a waste but the dragon's are cool.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|I really enjoyed the poems in the book. The sweet precious cat lover in US all is revealed in this book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|fun to play and very addictive! some levels can be rather tough to pass but it can be done .
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|This is a reply fun Japanese style monster movie. If you know your Godzilla,Gargantuas,Mothra, and Rodan ,buckle in and enjoy all of the references. More people should know DelToro.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it's very easy to see and use. everything is easy to touch so anybody can use it to help out.
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Being fans of Beyonce, my sister and I enjoyed this inside look into her work ethic and performances. She works hard. This doc is interesting even if you are not a fan. It's sophisticated and fun. Bonus song AND concert dvd of an amazing well put together show.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|another addictive game that I wasn't too sure I would like. I have found that it can be a bit daunting at first but with time and play I have been able to get better at it.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Awesome DVD. 3 discs and bonus features my sister enjoyed it all. Great gift. Wish season 3 was the same price!
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Great movie excellent hd quality, the 3d motion experiencie it is just awesome and very interesting thing about the special footage
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game, kinda slow to level up sometimes but it is pretty interesting to see how you care for a horse. Great for kids.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is mesmerizing!!! Wonder who though it up!?!?! Addicting, fun, and aggravating all at the same time! Love it, hate it! LOL
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a series that i could no put down until the end...brought me to tears which not many books can do.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|The American is a telling film with many large flaws, but its real value lies in the subtlety of expression both present and missing in the life of George Clooney's character. First of all,  the hit sequences in Italy are preposterous, especially within the confines of a small village. Secondly, a real hit man would have guessed the gun's manufacture right off the bat, and gone after his boss immediately. Thirdly, if the viewer wants action or the 'ascendent' Mr. Clooney, watch something else. Clooney did a good job in this film portraying an essentially empty man finally facing the utter failure, futility and error of his craft. The contrast with his prostitute companion, by far the freshest most beautiful prostitute imaginable, cuts into Clooney's dour cynicism and self-contempt, which is the inevitable moral result of his trade. In the end it is her love that redeems him as a man and as a human being, who at one point paid for her pleasure, and then discovered the greater pleasure he gained just by being with her, i.e., love crept back into his gray soul. As the film concludes his character gets grayer and grayer, a fitting testament to the emptiness of his life. And in the end he pays the final price all great moral error entails--full accountability. Further, in metaphor, this film is about what America and the American &#34;civilization' has finally devolved into. In this context, this film offers much more than just meets the eye.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Actual rating: 4.5 stars<br /><br />I was apprehensive when I went to watch this movie. I've seen a lot of zombie movies over the years and trust me, they were shouting a lot of &#34;mehs&#34;. But World War Z immediately erased my pre-conceived notions about such types of movies because it's awesome.<br /><br />Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a former UN employee was tasked to accompany a young doctor to South Korea to investigate about the origin of the virus  that caused a horrifying pandemic worldwide.<br /><br />I love how Brad brought Gerry to life.  He was believable as a father and as a soldier. Even Segen has grown on me even if she was silent the whole time.  Aside from the cast, I am also impressed with the world building of World War Z. It's terrifying and at the same time magnificent.<br /><br />The plot was also praise worthy. It's solid punctuated with a lot of actions, heart and terrifying discoveries. The virus was fully explained that even the non-scientific folks could understand. And the ending was nicely wrapped with no ciffhanger even if the movie has a sequel.<br /><br />All in all, World War Z exceeds my expectation and I recommend it to everyone who is into apocalyptic stuff.
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|It's great to have the dvd also. When we travel or visit family, we can play the dvd in their old players or on the computer, while at home we watch the blue-ray.<br /><br />The movie is great, and my 4 year old loves it!
B00BOXZAG6|2.0|Le sigh. This movie is just pure eye candy. &#62;,&#60; Let's breakdown what I like about this movie, shall we?<br /><br />a. Premise- Check.  Very original. It's not every day that I would come across a movie that is about 2 planets that are so near to each other that the different inhabitants could see and talk to one another. Heck, they could even work at the same company.<br /><br />b. World Building- Impressive and the almost merging of the 2 planets is very seamless.<br /><br />What I didn't like?<br /><br />a. Characters-  Jim and Kirsten just lacked the chemistry to make it work.<br /><br />b. Romance- Dull. It didn't have the intensity that I was looking for. It felt very high schoolish.<br /><br />c.Beginning- The beginning was a major info dump with Adam lengthily narrating the whole idea about the 2 planets. Instead of showing, he's just telling us. &#62;,&#60; d. Plot- The plot was clearly driven by the bland romance. And of course, the story was riddled with plot holes.  For example, it didn't explain why &#34;down below&#34; is poor while the &#34;up top&#34; is rich. And why the freaking people are prohibited to be in a relationship from those from the other planet when it's okay to be working alongside with them in the office.<br /><br />e. Ending- Huh? Was that the ending? Just like that? The obstacle faced by our hero and heroine was easily solved. And then there's a glimpse that the down below has already been improved implying that Adam's invention made wonders even if it wasn't shown how they were able to convince the government to implement the said changes.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking for a romance movie that would sweep you off your feet, better stick with Titanic.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Love Trespassing. There isn't one song that isn't great. Shady, Kickin' In, Runnin' and Chokehold are real standouts on this album. Adam Lambert's vocals are second to none currently in the business & one of the best ever.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!! I MAY BE A LIL BIT TOO OLD TO BE PLAYING IT IN SOME PEOPLE'S EYES;  BUT I DON'T CARE; ITS FUN. I HAVEN'T ENCOUNTERED ANY PROBLEMS YET; BUT IF I DO; I WILL BE SURE TO INFORM YOU!!! ;)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google is managed my GODS... if you need something that may believe is not created yet, check Google Play Store first. Don't waist your time with fancy and expensive product.

B00FATEJYE|2.0|This game was released late for amazon but Warner Bros. have decided to start from the beginning for updates which is great because it allows all challenges to be completed. I am pleased with how they have handled the game although there are a few small bugs. The game is both fun and challenging while still being simple. I would highly recommend this app for anyone with a tablet.<br /><br />Edit: Kindles still don't have the update and because of this the game is now glitching.
0937381888|5.0|Very thorough homebrew book starting from beginner brewing up to all grain brewing techniques. The book is broken into sections according to your brew level. I am currently brewing partial mash brews and this book has good information for helping me transition into all grain brewing. Would recommend this to anyone at any level of brewing.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|this. games is one of the treats games I have played in a long time.it is hard and exciting to see what happened to these people and it keeps you wanting to play and find out please get more games like this one.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book the second in the series. The movie just came out and the book was so detailed the movie was just like I imagined it would be. Amazing read. I could almost see them breathe while I was reading this book! Deserves five stars and a round of applause!!!!!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|The ending is so bad it ruins the other books for you. I would not recommend reading this if you want to still be able to enjoy the other books.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|I was hoping for a great collectors edition package because I loved this movie and this one delivers.  This is not a cheaply put together product.  It looks fantastic, and is exactly what I was hoping for.  I highly recommend this edition.  Everyone that has seen it has asked me where they can get one.  The case is solid, not flimsy and the disc holders inside are pretty cool as well.  The stand comes inside the case and is easy to setup.  One nice feature is the stand magnet sticks to the case and holds the case in place very well.  Initially I was worried the case simply balanced on the stand but the magnets are a nice touch for security.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I can't begin to say how much I loathe this film.  I was a big ST classic fan and reasonably liked most of the follow on series (but never as much as the original).  This is a REBOOT, i.e.  they took everything good about the original and booted it across space (and yes, even time).<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />First off, Spock has emotions.  If that isn't weird enough he's having an affair with Uhura.  Kirk has a broken childhood, which we find out is because the timeline has been altered by the dumbest set of Romulans in galactic history.  These idiots have a time machine, which they hijack after a failed attempt to HELP them.  Rather than going back in time 30 years to SAVE THEIR PEOPLE they go back to revenge the deaths of their families (which wouldn't happen if they had 2 brain cells to rub together) and make Spock watch them destroy Vulcan.  And yes they DESTROY VULCAN.  Ohh, on the way Spock is so pissed off (weird as that may be) at the insubordinate Kirk, he has him THROWN OFF the ship....never heard of the brig?????  But wait.  Where does he crash land?  Right next to Scottie, who has a minor job, but has managed one of the greatest feats of transporter technology (not even equaled in the next century) and BEAMS Kirk into the Enterprise as it zooms across intersteller distances....oy vey.  Please, just say no.  Don't rent this movie.  Don't even watch it if it's free.  Just leave a pleasant void where it would be.  A nice ST reboot shaped hole in space and time.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|your organization for my Kindle HDX really does make it easier to scan all the information... just like you claimed.  Thank you<br />Very Satisfied User in Brooklyn

1401235417|5.0|Batman: The Court of Owls launches the Dark Knight into the New 52 in a momentous first volume. Batman is Gotham's protector, its vigilant shadow which stalks the streets leaving justice in his wake. However, Gotham is not Batman's city. What will Batman do when faced with an evil dating back to the city's inception? A devious cabal of aristocrats named The Court of Owls have perched in Gotham's belfry. Their talons are entrenched in the city's foundation, and their eyes are fixed upon helpless prey; The Batman!<br /><br />Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo are the most endearing combination of writer/artist in the New 52. Snyder truly knows how to make a great story. His work belittles other novels in the New 52 because of his ability to create worthwhile villains (an achievement most writers can't…well…achieve), and not only keep the reader interested, but envelop them into the story. Rarely, have I come across a book that “captures” my mind, drags it through the dirt, and leaves me reeling at the end, wanting more.<br /><br />I respect Snyder for kicking Batman’s ass so to speak. He knows Batman’s capabilities, understands his mental and physical fortitude and shortcomings. With all of that in mind, he destroys Batman’s world, pushes him to his psychological peak, and leaves the reader in a “witnessing stance”; in utter shock (and this is only the Volume 1)! To be blunt, this is the best book in the New 52. 5 stars, nuff’ said.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele is a great singer, and this dvd is awesome. almost as good as being there. She can almost bring tears to your eyes, or at least tingles up your spine.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I expected a cheap cash in, but this is a mildly entertaining way to waste time. Also, be wary of spending money.
0307389839|5.0|Easily one of my favorite books about running. Less about the specifics of running and more how running is a part of the authors life.<br />When I got back into running after a long period of inactivity it helped accept where I was.<br />As I got into better shape I reread it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|As always, this mobile Android application is wonderful for your Android phone.  Does everything your Kindle can do and probably more.  Now I can keep place in my books via the phone.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is ostensibly the story of a life lived given over to a biographer. It is a tale of inter-tangled lives focused on loss, horrendous family choices and circumstances. The story is intriguing, the characters are deep and memorable and the setting is beautifully described; you can live in each scene. What sets this book apart, however, is the lovely, lyrical writing. Ms. Setterfield’s writing runs along a tightrope as nearly perfectly as we mere mortals may do in this fallen world: it is precise but warm, analytical yet feeling and story-driven mystery peopled with complex characters whom you could meet on a visit to a book shop. It is, without question, one of my favorite books even though its I don’t have a natural affinity to the story type.<br /><br />For full review: [...]
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love this book because it gives the reader the inside view of why secrets are so damaging. I love the way the author exploits every characters personal feelings before and after these secrets are revealed. The ending is really a surprise when the author gives the readers the chance to see what could have been if life would have deviated ever so slightly.  I'm not giving any more hints than that!! A must read!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Mind boggling, baffling, amazing.....this is Quell.  I can't stress this enough.  I've played 'em all and this is THE BEST if you're searching for a game you think is easy.  It seems that way at first.  But just when you think you can get the level complete in the specified number of moves...oops! you can't.  I'm a rather intelligent person but the farther you get, the harder it gets.  I started, re-started and re-started yet again certain levels the higher I got.  I love it-I'm sure you will too.  Well worth the tiny price tag.  You'll definitely play this game more than once.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|PERFECTLY DESCRIBED, CAME IN FLAWLESS CONDITION, COULD NOT BE ANY HAPPIER WITH THE PRICE. MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
B0089LOG02|5.0|Beautifully written.  I had a hard time putting this book down!  The lives of the characters come together in a way that at first glance is not imaginable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A look at history, at the baser and finer elements of people.  Characters developed so reader feels close to them.  And the plot, remarkable.
1596434252|5.0|Some of the pages stuck a little bit, but I think over time, it will really work like a well-oiled machine. This book is clever and imaginative, and I would definitely purchase it again. We gifted this to a couple involved in graphic design for their baby shower, and they were blown away.
B00004U8P9|5.0|A show that actually require you to participate, we loved it seen in the movie theater, with lots of people , would be more fun that way.<br />To see it on your own, alone don't have the same effect. Great performance.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app its so addictive I can even play  with my sister in multiplayer mode. Its to the Max of fun and creativity!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I love the Scarey Mister Stephen King, master of suspense and goose bumps. His books are by far the fastest reads!
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|this is a great app but I don't get why I have to download it twice once in the app store and once in the<br />game? ? Do what?  oh well that does not matter in the long run its still fun ...<br />Note this game needs 850 Mb of space to run so download it and have that much space or it will not work!  Enjoy and have a great time driving your dream car!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always this book is a good read. I have read everything John Grisham has written  and this one is exceptional. It is historically correct even though it is fiction. I highly recommend it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I couldn't be more happier with this game, it downloaded easy, and the gameplay is simple but extremely fun, I highly recommend this game for anyone who played It on Facebook, or not
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Love this app, wish there were more free packs, but at least they are reasonably priced. I play this site several time a day on multiple devices, not sure how you sync the devices though so that the packs you buy on one device are also purchased on all of your devices.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Gresham's best yet. This novel had my interest until the last page.  Great a plot and as always great courtroom scenes. Good job of reintroducing previous characters.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This book should have been called A Dance With Nothing. Because &#34;Nothing&#34; is exactly what happens. The author flat-out admits in the forward that this book is nothing but clippings from the cutting floor of the last book. And man does it show. I can't actually give you spoilers because there aren't any. And most ironically? The dragons aren't even in the book, except for maybe four pages!<br /><br />Here's a summary the action in book 5:<br />48 pages of random conversation that doesn't relate to anything.<br />One sentence description of somebody getting killed.<br />^^ repeat about 20 times.<br /><br />Seriously, there's a chapter called &#34;Dude on a Horse.&#34;<br /><br />The magic has really gone out of this series for me. I hope the next book is a million times better than this!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It's a well written book but the story wasn't for me. I didn't like any of the characters and ended up just finishing it to get it over with. I will try this author out again because, like I said the writing and pacing was quite good.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is so much help when it comes to the space and junk files that can accumulate on your tablet.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|ABP is great as a firefox addon and I switched to sideload firefox beta from mozilla for android with ABP as FF add on and it works however my Nov8 2013 download was buggy some how double loading webpages on accident in proxy settings provided by this app. It has taken a few weeks till developer understood why folks where complaining and admitted a issue that needs to be resolved.  But this update is not yet ready or updated here on Amazon Store. If the version provided is dated before this post avoid for now and check back later.
B00ABO609A|4.0|I thought both of the main characters were people believable. Indeed I saw some of myself in both of them and that I think is why I liked the movie so much.
B0060BHUXI|5.0|Great gift for the wife. My wife loves them and she actually understands<br />most of the non-english songs. I enjoy the music even if I don't understand<br />all of it.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|What can I say...  I'm a fan. Controls are easy.  Game play is easy.  A great free game.  So far I haven't felt the need to spend real money.
B00G922EA2|4.0|This appears to be a decent game.  I just started playing about an hour ago.  It is a little bit different from other HO games.  There aren't many HO scenes but there is alot of other stuff to do.  So far so good. Will update later if I find it necessary.
0345472322|4.0|Gives you insight on how our thought process works. Why we think the way we do. What things curve the way we think about things. Our mind is the most powerful tool we could ever use. If we learn how to control it in a positive, curious, way we will face the world with the perfect mindset.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This is the most frightening movie I have watched since I became an adult.  I will recommend to everyone who enjoys horror.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|sweet songs for work or the car ride home.  better if your special someone is in the car with you tho!
B00GLRLZ0K|5.0|it just came out really cool I like the deists one to its really fun the only wish more Colorado but awesome ;p
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game and the price is right!! Ads can annoy but the game is great and has a bunch of options
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Solitaire with a few more options and rules that require flexible thinking make this a challenging game. I recommend it but read. the rules so you understand the options.
B000059MEK|4.0|Brilliant.  One of the best albums.  Not as good in my opinion as the latest one but still a great listen.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|To everyone who reads this and has a cat, they will be nodding in agreement and laughing all the way through. Those who read it and do not have a cat will be nodding and saying, \\"I knew it!\\"
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Awesome album with all the hits and some misses.  Uplifting, poppy and fun.  This is a gift for but I like it too.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|couldn't get into it, slow and i guess not my type of book, to flowerry,  5 more words required? one more
B000RW3VD4|5.0|This Classic film about Wall Street shinanagans is a must see for any film buff.  Michael Douglas gives his best performance.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can spend hours on pinterest. Can find things easily. Love the share option. Sometimes though it won't let me post to Facebook.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Tommy Emmanuel is a brilliant guitarist.  Chet Atkins once remarked that Tommy is the greatest guitar player.<br />If you are an acoustic guitar enthusiast you will enjoy this recording immensely.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Fun family movie.  Belt is the unseen star of the show!<br /><br /> (I don't have anything else, but haven't met the requirement yet.)
1609611543|5.0|If you want to lose some weight and keep it off this book is for you. The history of Wheat is told so well and what has happened through genetically alteration to provide processed-food manufacturers the greatest yeild at the lowest cost. That means all wheat must be avoided. I did pick up some of the old type wheat at the health food store it is called Einkorn,100% organic. Can't wait to try the stuff we had growing 12,000 years ago.
B0034G4OYA|3.0|not the greatest movie but it was OKKAYY. alittle boring. a great story to the movie. it wasn't the worst tho
B000RZIGVS|5.0|To any Star Trek fans this is a must buy I have been looking for the perfect gift for a Star Trek fan and I know this is going to make him happy. It also comes in this really cool storage case it looks really impressive the case opens and flips like a book. It will last for some time if you are a collector.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The cast is funny and do not take themselves so seriously.  Anyone that has seen these guys in their big hit movies will recognize the one liners interspersed within the serious dialog.  This movie is better than the original Expendables..
B00GNK18X4|5.0|I think these songs are good choices for people to listen too. I am a one direction fan myself so if you like one direction you will most definitely want this track. I encourage you to get this track to learn new music and love new songs! Enjoy!
B000VMBXNA|5.0|Just a really fun read.  Our book club loved it, also.  I have recommended it to many other people.  Thanks.
1419702238|5.0|All the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are enjoyed by children ages 6-14,  at least.  The readers love these books and<br />Love to read about the antics and humor.  And this is a series that children enjoy so much they reread the books more than once.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|I really adore Carlos Santana, but this particular album has to grow on me.  It isn't as seductive as his Dance of the Rainbow Serpent...
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|McCartney has still got it!  Great songs that should be played on the radio.  Its amazing how he can continue to come up with catchy tunes after fifty years of making us happy.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Personally, I don't get it. But my husband adores this movie. So, I guess it's a good one...according to him.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started reading.  Now to book 2.  Must follow Anastasia and Christian  and their tumultuous love.
0761163808|5.0|I recently bought this for my friend's little boy. This is one of the coolest books I've ever seen. Even as an adult, I thought it was so much fun. I've seen other books like this, but by far, this one's the best. Well worth the cost, as it's a tad high.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book several months ago but the characters are all still vividly alive in my heart.  It is funny and tragic, sometimes on the same page.  You won't easily forget this great work about courage, love and human suffering.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Um...what's there to say. JAWS is one of the greatest films in all of cinematic history. Buy it! Duh! It's not as though you'll be sorry.
B00GPE9HEA|5.0|SHOCK AND AWE! I have been a huge Britney fan for her entire career. And with every album you can see a little more and more of her coming through. So far my favorite album had been &#34;In the Zone&#34; and &#34;Femme Fatale&#34;. But this album brings together pieces of every Britney album to date. It is not only a very personal album it is a GREAT album. Its personal yet the beats lift you from your chair and you have to dance, Its very grown up and it really seems that Ms. Britney Jean has come full circle. There are a few ballads towards the end of the album.. Some love songs, some about break ups and sex. This is THE BEST POP ALBUM of 2013 HANDS DOWN! Ive listened to some of the others and Britney Jean is by far superior. There is rumor that this is her last album.. Lets hope not, I want MORE of this. When Britney is in her lane WATCH OUT! She will run you down! If I could give this album *****10***** stars I would.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is one of my favorite films, and I think I've seen them all. I have quite diverse taste in films, music, art. This movie is not only visually stunning, it's emotionally beautiful and thought provoking. Can't go wrong.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|To start with, I'm pretty techy.  As a matter of fact, we're deploying almost 250 new Android tablets and were looking for a video streaming device to assist with presentations.  I reduced the rating by one star because picture quality on a 55&#34; tv was bad.  Another star went because on an Android, it only works with 5 or 6 predetermined apps.  Another star got dropped because, no matter what you read, see, or hear, this device DOES NOT cast Chrome browser tabs from an Android tablet.  After trying for an hour, I called Google support.  Was told that it would only cast from a desktop or laptop.  Totally defeats my purposes.  It does, though, get two stars because, for the price, if you don't have a streaming option on your tv, being able to get Pandora, HBO to Go, Netflix, and a couple of others is worth it.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Story Line:<br />The story line creates a web of intrigue  which comes together in a credible form - very entertaining.<br /><br />Style :<br />Writing style is easy to read and has real quality, revealing serious journalistic experience.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|At my age 30-40, I feel silly playing the game, but it is fun. Has some hard and easy parts to keep you guessing and cussing.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|just Wonderful !  This is my second cd from IL Divo<br /><br />I love every song ....amazing voices<br /><br />Love it !
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I've used this device to watch several Netflix movies, only to find the sound disappear at some point?  I own several streaming devices, including the awesome Netgear Neo running Android, and none with an audio problem.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Jeff Lynne has chosen the most amazing songs and his arrangements in this album hit you where your heart is !<br /> I play it in my office and people will stop by , stick their head in and say &#34; Whoa , what is that  Music !<br /><br /> My own clients LOVE it<br /><br />One of the Best cd's I ever purchased !
B00ESW4TJ4|5.0|This is the most amazing device I've purchased since the iPhone.  The 360 photos are even better than anticipated.<br />On the slightly negative side, I haven't found a way to share the 360 photo without a Theta banner running on the bottom.  You can see my photos on Twitter @richinthenight
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|So far I'm loving this game. Let me get back to it!!! I will rate again later on in game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is deadly. It kills your free time. I love it. The only issue I have is that once you figure out fungus, you figured it all out.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|very good toy, my son plays with it all the time, no problems so far with it, would buy again
1400095204|4.0|Great novel. A great writer.The story of the African experience.Once started couldn't put of down<br />Gloss over the names since they are difficult to pronounce, but it doesn't take anything away from the storyline
B00632HWOG|1.0|not sure what happened but I cant even see my emails. I only use my kindle fire, so not sure how I'm going to check my email anymore. thanks for adding to my shopping list Yahoo.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|Kind of a loose fit, and weird feel, but what the heck... they're super inexpensive and do what they're supposed to do.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some levels make me want to scream!  But when your bored it is great entertainment.  I use it weekly til the lives deplete that is.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Easy to use app for accessing amazon on my tablet.  Never have any problems, and it's much faster going to my account via the app than through a web browser.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Interesting? When I first watched it, I wasn't crazy about it, I gave it to my grandson, asked him to explain it to me, I watched it again and now I get it I meant to give it 4 stars, I am a si-fi fan and will watch it again I suppose.  Great special effects.
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|Excellent quality -- highly recommend!  No problems with play.  You will not go wrong with this item and the price was right too!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works as advertised, I'm looking forward to more sites becoming compatible with device like youtube is set up for HD chromecast.  A simple set up.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! Usually books to movie don't pan out, however I felt they did a good job with this one!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I like it.Just don't like the ads that come with it. Those ads are very irritating. Also, don't like the Kindle only Amazon apps.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is such a great movie, I'm usually not the biggest fan of historical movies but this one is moving and witty and I enjoyed every scene. I purchased this recently for my Dad who I know will also love it!
0804161380|5.0|An amazing set of guides. All top notch quality.  Only downside is they don't come with a map that you would have gotten if you purchased the guide when it originally released.  Book mark is excellent as well and the gloss on the chest is epic.
0804161380|5.0|As a big Zelda fan this treasure chest is magnificent and since I own all of these games it was a no brainer for me. As i've gotten older it's been harder to enjoy Zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i don't have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade. The golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from Wind Waker. The guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through. If you love LoZ and own these games get this before they're gone.

B007SUW24W|2.0|I liked a few songs he had on the radio, but the rest are not really my style. Not what i thought it would be. The seller was perfect everything came on time and in great condition just don't really like the songs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is so horribly written it makes even the sex foul and smelling like rotten meat left in a hot glove compartment. The fact that it's so popular is inexplicable and depressing. I wish I could click negative stars but I can't.
B0036G8IQS|4.0|I am just finishing up the Percy Jackson series.  My Grandson and I are both reading it together.  It is great reading and brings us together along the way.

B00280LYIM|4.0|I am just finishing up the Percy Jackson series.  My Grandson and I are both reading it together.  It is great reading and brings us together along the way.  So far I think this is the best one of the whole series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is great it shows how to work it out and everything. I tried multiple sources and this one works for me. ={)
140006922X|5.0|whichever side of the argument you stand on.... this is a Must Read... I´m not going to say that after reading this Im sold on one idea or another, but a little history rather than just traditional &#34;dogma&#34; helps with perspective... I think its both our right and our duty to make up our own mind.  Aslan provides a counter argument long overdue for me...
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Anyone who has ever owned a cat will relate to this poetry collection. The author has captured our furry little with his rather witty poems.

B00FQ53NIA|1.0|Terribly disappointing...  After such great albums as &#34;Black Out&#34; and FF....  These songs lack the catchy phrases and melodies of albums past...
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have connected with old friends and made new ones here.  I have also found several groups who share similar interests.  This has been a blessing.
0399171541|5.0|This book starts like poetry.  The writing, although not similar to F Scott Fitzgerald, has as much character as F Scott.  It's rewarding enough to just take in the descriptions.  At times, I could see and feel Morrissey's plight and often understand and empathize with what he has been through.<br /><br />That said, the book truly picks up when the music starts happening.  The solo career is vastly more interesting than the &#34;Smiths&#34; stuff - but each has it's own highlights.<br /><br />As a Morrissey fan, it ended all too soon.  Would've like to read more details about his current tours and band.<br /><br />Great read.  Recommended...
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I love Adele.  Her voice is unique, delivery superb, and everything she does thrills me.  I will probably buy every CD she records.I
B00005YJ5Q|5.0|I don't think I could ever finish a review for this record. No other album sounds like this. Indeed a one of a kind. Can has always experimented and pushed the boundaries of soundscapes and music. This record is one of their most experimental. The title of the album is a name of an unpopulated island in Spain near Ibiza. It is indeed magical and at times I feel like I am in a cave during some sort of dark séance. As if I should not be here. Multiple times during the record I would say, &#34;I can not believe my ears!&#34; Owning this on vinyl is the ultimate collector's piece.
B005LAIIGM|3.0|If you were thinking about waiting till this comes out on DVD, you might want to reconsider. I saw this on a pre-Oscar &#34;viewer&#34; and it was underwhelming. Nothing like the rave reviews elsewhere. Many of the technical details were right (I am a &#34;rocket science&#34; veteran), but many were wrong, including several vital to the story. As my industry host said, &#34;it's not the techie details, you idiot, it's the story!&#34; But in a high-tech story like this one, details like orbital mechanics do matter. There is enough basic story to enjoy, it's just not fabulous.

0446556726|5.0|Michael Connelly is a great author and I just love all of his books about Harry Bosch. I did not finish reading the book yet but the ending is close and it held my attention throughout. Michael Connelly makes the character Harry Bosch so real and believable that it is hard to believe he is just a fictional character.  Bosch's investigative skills are put to the task in the Black Box with the added interferences of his commanding officer, but this only makes him more determined to solve this twenty year old case.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I had high hopes for the Chromecast, but it is of no real value in home entertainment.  First, one would assume that this little stick it a little android computer onto which one could install apps and use your phone or tablet to control.  WRONG.  The chromecast is no better than the intel streaming video feature that was a bust from a couple of years back.  Remember that?  You buy an Intel enabled laptop chipset that pushes your screen to a tv using a special box that hooks to the tv....that one...remember? Of course not, they don't make it anymore because it was such a bust.  Same principle, cheaper hardware and equally lackluster result.<br /><br />What you will get with the Chromecast is access to a handful of apps that must be on your device.  This includes Netflix and Youtube and a few other odd apps.  No Xfinity.  No Direct TV.  No web browser unless you want to use your PC/MAC laptop with the device.  Again, just like the old Intel push to tv concept.  BTW, if I'm using my laptop, then what's the point?  I can just hook an HDMI cable my TV and be able to use everything on my laptop with the TV as a clone display.  In fact, you can do the same with your droid tablet.<br /><br />To add to limited options, you also have performance issues.  In particular, using the chromecast with my Samsung tablet, Netflix will fade out to black after a few minutes.  I still hear the sound, but no picture.  If I switch to another HDMI input, then back to the chromecast input, I get the picture back.  Really annoying.<br /><br />I want something that works out of the box with no bugs.  Want to be able to play internet content on the tv without a pc.  Chromecast does neither.  I suggest you avoid it until they substantial improve it.  I wasted 3 hours screwing with this thing. It is not intuitive and has is buggy.  Expected more from google.<br /><br />I am shocked at the number of positive reviews for this product.  It is a DOG.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|So interesting; each character has flaws and strengths. A very well-written drama and superb actors. Can't wait for the 3rd season!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|an Excellent read. i found i could not put this book down once i started it. each chapter is thrilling as well as educational on the life of a Navy Seal and family.
B003U51D58|5.0|I loved the way it ended! Not the dead part, but everything else was so touching and sad, but what a way to go!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is a ton of fun...but beware...when you run out of lives you have the option of purchasing more lives via the app store.  I find that I end up spending a fair amount of money just so I can keep playing late at night when I cant sleep.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Thanks for finally getting it for kindle fire. Like the new boosters have more fun playing it now. Love the updates.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have recently found e bay.  It is so much fun to find about anything you need and have the ability to get it at a good price.  This works fine.  I recommend it to any shopper.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|pretty good does stall every now and then.  but it's. tough so it makes it fun.  it is a slow game
B00FF9SKSK|5.0|I fought with someone today over how i was still upset about #PaulWalker close to a week after his traumatic death... Their argument was that people die everyday, especially the soldiers who fight for me... As truthful as his argument was... My retort explained it all...<br /><br />&#34;You don't understand. Yes, I am grateful and appreciate the soldiers who fight for our country... But I don't know these people... I mean, yeah, I only knew Paul based off of every interview or movie he's done since i first saw him in 'Pleasantville' back in 1998... But it feels like i lost an awesome older brother... I was there for his ups and downs. I was there when he bought that soldier an engagement ring to give to his fiance in 2004, I've been there for all of the Fast and Furious movies... So yeah, people die everyday, true... But your older brother doesn't die everyday...&#34;<br /><br />#RIPPaulWalker #FastAndFurious #PaulWalkerTribute
1623650003|5.0|I don't know if it was the translation or just how the author wrote the book, but it took me awhile to really get into this book and get used to the writing style.  The book is broken down into 3 sections.  By the end of the first section, I was hooked as there was an unexpected twist that completely captivated me.  The twists just kept coming throughout the remainder of the book, and I am now a huge fan.  At the back of the book is a glossary and some explanation into French law, police, and judicial process.  I suggest that you read this first as it may help make sense of what you read.  It in no way discusses the story, rather helps you understand more clearly how the French system works.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love to read and Listen to the word of God, And I also Love to live by his word. this the best Bible app there is. And is my favorite of all apps.

B003U6BE8I|4.0|I bought this for my eleven-year-old grandson. He had already read the book and enjoys the Percy Jackson series. He also enjoyed this movie.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I am older and really enjoyed this puzzle. I liked the music and graphics. I plAyed it late into the night. I  didn't want to quit. GREAT PUZZLE
0375842209|5.0|This fictional book was required reading for my grandson at his school. He pestered me until I bought it and read it for myself. My husband also read it. Then we discussed it with our grandson. This book was his first exposure to the Holocaust. It gave my husband and me a chance to discuss the greater historical issues contained in the Holocaust and how we can understand them today. It became a stepping stone to in-depth discussions. The schools do not teach enough modern history (from WWI forward) and this book became the impetus for us to teach our grandson much-needed lessons on history.
014241543X|1.0|Very dark disturbing book.  I would not recommend it as a Christmas gift.  Or as any gift for that matter.
0307730700|5.0|I bought this book for my husband. He could not put it down; it was a page-turner. We have given it to our grandson, who will pass it on to his brother when he is finished reading it. My guys really like it.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Amazing Album, although some may argue they changed their sound and have deviated from the &#34;true A7X&#34; sound, A7X has always been changing in order to evolve and adapt to their situations and surrounding events. That's what makes them an amazing band.
1476734941|5.0|Very clear and concise explanation on the diet and the rationale behind it. The examples of various people using the method...how they may have modified it, the results they saw, etc were very helpful.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I've owned F& F series on all formats DVD, HD-DVD, Blu-Ray.<br />I'm still in shock that Paul Walker is no more. Could not believe when the news came out. Thought was a hoax but alas its real.<br />Really Really sad :(.<br /><br />Saw this movie in theaters last summer and pre-ordered this as soon as it became available.<br />Its a must-buy for Fast and Furious franchise fan.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|This movie is a classic. If you love old horror movies, this movie is definitely for you. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I thought it a dreary story of a hurt woman who takes out<br />her sorry\ow upon herself in casual sex,drugs --- and a crazy<br />long walk that she is not prepared for.  She is the sort of<br />person I would expect to call a suicide line to get perspective<br />on living.  I am sorry for her, but I don't want to read on about<br />her after 60 pages or so.  I am glad it cost only $2.50 on<br />kindle.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|When I am truly enjoying a Steven King novel ;I can't put it down,I wish it was even longer,and when I do put it down I can't easily go to sleep. What was that noise,what is that shape in the darkest corner of my room and is that breathing I hear under the bed? I enjoyed this book,but to compare it with The Shining or Salem' s Lot is ludicrous. No sweaty hands or heart palpitations over here. However if you've been wondering what happened to little Danny since being chased by the topiary in the Shining (one of my all time best scenes in any book,scared the he'll out of me) then this book is well worth reading. As always bad guys are creepy,good guys are flawed and the monsters (real and imagined) are right out of our childhood nightmares. Read this book,but don't expect a classic.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|This is a great movie, the best one yet! the 3d effects are awesome. Must have for your Iron Man movie collection!
B00957T6X6|5.0|Love the Kind version for this series!  I tried reading it in print and couldn't do so because it hurt my eyes.  The font is too small in the books and there are too many words per page.  Buying it for the kindle I can set it to whatever size I need, and reading it is so much more comfortable!  I couldn't finish book 1 last time buy I am flying through them now that I have them on the kindle!  I suggest everyone buy the series for their electronic reading device!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|My sister is in love with Leonard Cohen's music. She asked me to order this for her & has practically worn it out. He has such a rich, multi-leveled sound to his voice. Hard to not like this album.
1451627289|2.0|This book is incredibly self-indulgent. I am a woman so maybe that has something to do with why I was so annoyed by the main character's musings into what an awesome guy he is and his dream girl just so casually being clumsy in one of those adorable ways that only is charming in terrible Kate Hudson movies, or perhaps the fact that there are random dance sequences that get tweens really riled up in movies like Grease or whatever. King doesn't allow the main character to evolve. He is clearly projecting his idea of the perfect guy (a professor, and a writer - imagine that!), the perfect girl (charmingly clumsy, in need of some serious protection, in capable of achieving an orgasm until -- you guessed it-- he comes along), a perfect town where the students love their teachers so much that it looks like Saved by the Bell, and... there's this ancillary issue with Kennedy.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Wow a real eye-opener. What was most disturbing to me was the  level of cruelty inflicted on the animals we eat. They are never treated or seen as animals but more like meat product that is not dead yet but will be soon so who cares. I can still hear the chickens in the chicken house without any light at the beginning of the movie. Yes, I cannot stop hearing their cries, the horror those poor animals must endure in total darkness. How can anyone be so cruel toward animals? We hear and read about people being arrested for &#34;animal cruelty&#34; when it involves dogs, cats, etc. Why aren't these corporations and their &#34;farmers&#34; being arrested for animal cruelty? Part of me wishes I had not watched this movie. It is so disturbing. I already buy mostly grassfed, free range and organic. But now I will NEVER eat the eggs or flesh of animals raised this way. It cannot be healthy physically or spiritually. God have mercy on us.
0399255370|5.0|This book deserves all of the accolades. It's worth reading a re-reading and my stepson is going to be delighted at the personification of these disgruntled crayons. The vocabulary is unique and I can already imagine my five year old copying some of the things they say. Very unique and a great read
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an amazing read. I was swept into the life of the young protagonist and her foster family and the new world in which she found herself as WWII began. The characters were beautifully developed and the imagery was stunning. Death made a novel and effective narrator. It was so emotionally wrenching tough that I don't think I can watch the movie yet.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the book, although it took me a while to get involved in the stories and sympathize. Easy to read, thought-provoking story that is real and relevant.
B00GD9F59S|4.0|I want to thank Kate Kaynack at Spencer Hill Press for sending me a copy of this book when my copy was backed up on Amazon! I could not wait to get my hands on this and see the conclusion of one of my all time favorite series! And I was not disappointed. As usual, Armentrout kept me on my toes through this whole book and I had NO idea how it would end!<br /><br />Blurb from Goodreads:<br />It's a beautiful day for a war.<br />As the mortal world slowly slips into chaos of the godly kind, Alexandria Andros must overcome a stunning defeat that has left her shaken and in doubt of their ability to end this war once and for all.<br />And with all the obstacles between Alex and her happily-ever-after with the swoonworthy Aiden St. Delphi, they must now trust a deadly foe as they travel deep into the Underworld to release one of the most dangerous gods of all time.<br />In the stunning, action-packed climax to the bestselling Covenant series, Alex must face a terrible choice: the destruction of everything and everyone she holds dear… or the end of herself.<br /><br />I will honestly say that while I love this cover it is not my favorite of the series. When it was released, I was actually disappointed. I saw a mock up of a cover that I LOVED. It was a turquoise blue and just oh so beautiful. I thought for sure that was going to be it, but I was wrong and that made me sad. But, you can't love all covers now, can you?<br /><br />I could probably write a whole book about how this series makes me feel. As a whole it gets an A in my book for sure. I love the characters, the action, the romance, the situations you think will never turn out right. Armentrout takes the bull by the horns and tosses him around like he's nothing. There's no doubt in my mind that at some point I will read this series again (and I DO NOT re-read books!).<br /><br />I was excited to see Alex is back to her good old self in this book: snarky, loving, a little selfish but in a selfless sort of way, and mostly just a kick butt heroine. I don't find her to have tons of angst, which always makes me happy because angst totally pulls me right out of a story. And her loyalty is undying, which makes her even more lovable in my book! Alex always rises to the occasion, and this book is no different.<br />And Aiden, well, he is my ultimate book boyfriend. Talk about fiercely loyal. He loves Alex for who she is, no strings attached, no cares as to what others think. He makes her his world and it's amazing to watch it flourish so much more in this book because they are not afraid of who knows the truth. The only issue I had with him in this book is he really did say Agapai mou WAY too many times. I don't think there was a conversation with Alex he had in this book that didn't include this phrase. When I was first introduced to the phrase, I loved it; I cherished when he would say it. But in this book it was a bit over done. That made me sad. I wanted it to be something that he said when it needed to be said. And, while I'm all for people telling each other they love each other, it was just a bit overboard for me.<br />Seth, well, I'm still not sure what to think. I hate him, but I love him. I hate that he has been such an idiot in the past. I hate that he let power consume him and blind him to what is right and just. And yet, I love how he tries his hardest to redeem himself. And how he gives up everything so that Alex can be happy. I was wary of the fact that Alex knew right away that Seth was willing to help them as opposed to hinder them, but I guess that is the Apollyon connection?<br /><br />I love the plot of this book, although I found the pacing a bit slower than the previous books. I can honestly say I really had no idea where it was going or how it would end. Every situation the characters were put in ended in some catastrophe, despite the fact that they made it through. I did think I would shed more tears in this book than I did, but it didn't happen, until the end.I had some tears there, but then they were happy tears. There are so many emotions that this series brings. And the story itself is one of sacrifice, love, hate, hope, sadness, happiness, and loyalty, and I could go on and on<br /><br />As for Jennifer's writing, well, it's her writing, which I always enjoy. She really knows how to pack power into her words and her world. My favorite part of how she writes is how she always interjects humor into what she's doing. She loves to lighten the mood when things are looming over her characters.<br /><br />Overall, the ending was not what I expected. I was happy that things turned out the way they did, don't get me wrong, but I was just wanting more of a fight, more of the heart wrenching sadness that would make me want things to turn out differently. The book certainly has a ton of great moments. Times when I thought for sure it was all over and I would want to throw the book across the room. Was it worth the wait, sure it was, I needed to get my conclusion for the series. But, again, it was not what I was expecting and, while it did not leave me hanging and wrapped things up in a nice package, I just feel like I am missing that little something that would have made this series go out with a bang for me.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I do not know if  I liked the way this book ended or not.  I am currently of the mind that  the relationship between Peeta and Katniss was one of convenience and not real to her if it was real to him.<br />I am looking forward to the release of the film next Spring to see how the actors portray the  chemistry during the final scenes.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow...I need time to process, but I will tell you I was a blubbering fool for the last 50 pages of this book.<br />So, I let myself process and I'm still keeping my 5 stars. Despite some of the faults I found with the book, overall I really felt it was truly a great conclusion to this series.<br /><br />Blurb from Goodreads:<br />One choice will define you.<br />What if your whole world was a lie?<br />What if a single revelation—like a single choice—changed everything?<br />What if love and loyalty made you do things you never expected?<br />The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered—fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she’s known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.<br />But Tris’s new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature—and of herself—while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.<br /><br />In the hopes of keeping this review spoiler free, I am pretty sure it's going to be shorter than most of what I write.<br /><br />If you want a book that is going to totally tug at your heart strings and make your feelings fly all over the place, then I'm pretty sure this book will hit the mark.<br /><br />The character development in this one is fantastic. My favorite part was actually getting inside Tobias's (Four's ) head. For the longest time we saw Four through Tris's eyes, and as we all know that can't really show us what a character is truly about. Having Four reveal to us what he's thinking, feeling, wanting, was just incredible and really gave a whole new flavor to this series.<br />As for Tris, she kind of annoyed me in this book. As usual she's a bit selfish, always thinking that she's thinking of others but never actually doing it. It was a bit frustrating, but I think all in all she was coming from a good place and really wanted to the best for everyone she loved.<br /><br />The plot, well it's certainly a twist I was not expecting. I have read a few dystopian's recently that took this turn of events, but not in such a way that kept me totally enthralled. The explanation for the factions, how they were formed and why, it totally turned me around and had me walking backward! I was not expecting it. And the pacing was perfect. I was never bored, I always wanted more and I really didn't want to put the book down.<br /><br />There is so much controversy over how Roth decided to end this series. And, while it broke my heart to read the things she wrote, I give her so much credit for going there and doing what she needed she felt to do to bring this saga to a close. It's artistic license and it's amazing. Will people hate her for it, sure. Will people understand her for it, some will some won't. But it really doesn't matter in the long run what others think because it's what was necessary in her eyes and that's what really matters. The chance she takes is amazing and I totally get down on bended knee and praise her for it!<br /><br />Here is my thought to those who are upset: It's a DYSTOPIAN world, things cannot be perfect, having a happily ever after is UNREALISTIC and if you feel like that's what you want, perhaps reading a different sub-genre would be more your style. Roth truly hurt me with this book, but it was necessary. Recently I have been let down by the ends of the trilogies I have been reading. They have not met my expectations at all. But this book, well, this one shot me right back to wanting to read trilogies again.<br /><br />Bravo Ms. Roth. I can't wait to see what you come up with next!
0395389496|2.0|I bought this book for my 6-year-old cousin who loves the movie so much, he ruined his DVD so I bought that too. I was very excited to get this book because it came with the collectable ornament and CD however when I opened my box I did notice it was not packaged very well for shipping. The cover was damaged and bent. I was not happy with the look of it, but I do know he will love it to pieces anyway.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|awesome!<br />graphics are so real.Better than the movie. Best game ever!  I love this game.It has all of the robots in the movie and more.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My children watched these Classic children's movies when they were young.  Now I am buying them again for my Grandchildren.  It is fun to watch them all over again with my Grandchildren.  Brings back fun memories.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|THIS IS A VERY ADDICTING GAME. I LOVE IT AND THE DRAGONS ARE SO CUTE. IT'S AWESOME. I also like that it doesn't freeze up.<br />And it's very easy to play. I also like that I can interact with my kids.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent app!!! I highly recommend this great game.  I play it for hours. Get it and have a relaxing evening.<br />Much better than some others out there.  Get it for a real challenge in every game.  It challenges you at many levels.  :-) X
0375507256|1.0|Fabulous story. I am still reading it, but it keeps you engaged and the layers of plot that pass in and out through time and their unique ways of revealing themselves it is a work of art just the flow and the voice the Author uses. I will review it further when I finish.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|Reading this book was like  falling in love in a bar. At first it was totally enthralling, exciting, tugging on my heartstrings fabulous, and then in the morning when I sobered up--when this amazing author moves into the present-- just sort of okay. This is a wicked smart, inventive story telling that just left me down at the end. Absolutely worth reading.
B003G4W49C|5.0|excellent story cant wait to read the next book. I couldn't put it down till  I reached the end, just cant wait to see what happens next
B00447L4JG|5.0|This could  possibly be Tim Burton's greatest production.  My two year-old daughter loves this movie and so do I! I would recommend this movie to anyone with kids.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I had to scrimp and save to buy this but it was well worth waiting for. The picture on the front of the cover brought a smile to my face and the music on the cd is just lovely. I can't wait for more.
0739384171|5.0|I love the entire Millennium Trilogy. Book 2 explains why and how Lisbeth Salander became so powerful and reactive. A subset of the Trilogy is the revealing troubles beneath the wonderful, peaceful facade that Sweden presents to the world. There are evil undercurrents and these are the things Mikael Blomkvist pursues as a journalist. Larrsson makes use of the inherent tension between the abused and those who would uncover abuses and seek persecution of abusers.<br />These stories may not be the greatest literature but they are powerful and dynamic, exciting and sometimes mysterious. It is to be regretted that the author died before he could continue his art.
B0095VPAVE|1.0|Complete trash, called a &#34;gaming&#34; apu, but it can barely run planetside 2 on the absolute lowest settings. I feel robbed even though I got it for free at AMD fan day....get intel....now I need to save money to buy an i5
0984999302|1.0|Talk about a sleeper of a book.....this author is a bit on the wacky side and if you believe any of these concepts, you need a lesson in life.  I cannot believe people actually liked this...the writing was poor, the editing was sad, the overall looks of the book was retro at best.  Amazon, isn't there anything less than one star?
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Great game for the price game play is easy to learn and get a hang of I also really like apples
031623480X|5.0|I really like books that challenge people to think out of the box yet the book is backed by hard facts taken from scientific research. I was skeptical about the whole gluten thing but as soon as I eliminated gluten from my diet it was amazing how much better I felt. I have tried to limit my carbs for a long time now as I know they are bad for you and cause weight gain, but the gluten thing was new to me. I have worked in healthcare for almost 20 years and I can attest that doctors tend to just follow mainstream medicine handing out pills to remidy people's ailments and it is not working!
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game comes with no instructions.  It is very frustrating just trying to figure it out.  I had to go online and ask for instructions, which still made no sense.  I will keep trying, but not sure I will ever learn it.
B008M721MS|1.0|Too complicated!!!!  Too many passwords to get anywhere!!!!!  The kindle should be preloaded with basic popular apps to start off!!____overload and let me delete___-----too many geek terms.  Unable to use Skype...too complicated used like what the hell is sync required?  Also cannot print to my wireless printer.  Very disappointed  with the kindle fire hd.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Great to re-think the idea of the &#34;ideal&#34; personality. Certainly raises my sensitivity. Well researched and amplified with stories. Well worth reading.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I like the entire Fast and the Furious series.  It won't be the same now that Paul Walker is gone.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Guess what, Microsoft?  We don't all live in McMansions with 100 sq ft living rooms or tricked out gaming basements.  I've got about 25 sq ft to play in, and while it's doable for one person, I would like to play with friends at some point.<br /><br />I hoped my experience would be better than others when I started with Child of Eden, and I seemed to be playing better and even beat the level with the Zoom in place.  Then I switched to Adventures and was excited when the setup screen placed me in the \\"best\\" zone rather than the \\"good.\\"  However, it turned out to make the game itself absolutely unplayable -- my avatar's hand jittered so much I could barely hold it in place for menu selections, and my character jumped and contorted itself all over the screen even when I was standing still, so zero motor control.<br /><br />These are the only two games I own, but based on this sampling I'm very disappointed in the Zoom.  I'll hold onto it for when my friends join me just in case, but I suspect I'll have better luck just mounting my sensor higher when my wall mount arrives.  It would be nice if Microsoft would do something to accommodate the small (sarcasm) population of apartment dwellers in America.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Last night I actually took the time to recalibrate the sensor with the Zoom in place.  This has made a world of difference.  I won't go so far as to say it improves tracking of just one person necessarily, but I'm assuming will matter when I want to play with a friend.  Might be worth a try if you can pick it up cheap.
B009LDCZ7I|2.0|First season was more interesting and compelling.  Second season, while still good, seemed disjointed and a little &#34;bi-polar&#34;, to use a fitting term...the ending even seemed a little bit sophomoric.  It came across as if the writers couldn't quite figure out where the story should be going. Acting is excellent, especially Mandy Patinkin.  Not sure if I'd spend the money for the third season.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is fantastic.  If you are a fan of Wheel of TIme, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Eragon, or even Dune, I can easily see finding this book engaging and intriguing.  The author has a really impressive range of distinct authorial voices that serve to make each character's perspective and their respective chapters stand out, with something different to be appreciated and drawn to in each character's own individual story, all while you mull over and try to connect the threads of the greater story being woven between each of the characters.  There is some really great character development AND compelling world building to be found here. As my brother, who recommended the book to me initially, said, &#34;this is the start of something great.&#34;
B008LXZFH6|3.0|I grew up in the seventies and remember the attitudes and lousy fashion.  It was a pretty funny movie. Worth seeing once sober and worth seeing twice while drinking lots of alcohol.  To bad we don't have anchor man gang battles, the MMA and WWF would go broke.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|I was surprised by this movie, the acting from the kids was pretty good and McConaughey has surprised me again by good acting.  This is a coming of age movie for young boys entering teen age years so if your an adult you may be not like it as its seems to be meant for kids and parents that have to watch  kid movies with there kids..  good for kids  and not to bad for adults lol.

B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Great story. Very interesting to learn the background story of the creater of the first and longest running children's books. Totally engaging. Where did the time go?
B009DH2PP4|4.0|Good all-around book for anyone who home-brews.  It has a lot of detailed information and provides a good reference to the brewing process.  Since it is a general book, it does lack a few specifics to a few of the procedures covered in the book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Many ups and downs but it will keep you reading. Emotional and entertaining! Collins knows how to entertain an audience.

006202406X|1.0|I am so disappointed with the 3rd book in this Trilogy.  There are many reasons for my negative review.  Most of which you can read from other posts.  The bottom line for me is that the really good story in the first two books was lost in the third.  I found Roth's work in Allegiant lazy and boring.  I was so eager to read the 3rd book only to find myself unable to keep reading it no matter how hard I tried.  I finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through the book to write this post.<br /><br />I know Roth is a young writer and I am sure she will get better but she had a chance for greatness in this Trilogy.  Unfortunately it slipped away with Allegiant
B00EB9Z9Z2|5.0|Rhonda has done it again. Written a book that is easy to read and yet provides instant result. We need to be constantly reminded to follow our dreams and that is what the Hero delivers. It will urge you to follow your heart so that you do not lie on your deathbed with regrets. It is not a book for people who like to live an ordinary life but rather someone who wants to fulfill their dreams an also helps others doing it.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a significant book. Thousands who reviewed it agree that this is so. It has been voted as one of the ten most influential books. It gave a sense of sanity to many people and saved many lives. It is thought provoking and will change the thinking and actions of many people who read it.<br /><br />Psychoanalysts have tried to explain what motivates people and what holds them together so they do not fall apart when troubles occur. Freud, for example, developed the idea that the sex drive propels people even when it is pushed into the subconscious and is sublimated. Art, according to him, is sublimated sex. Adler, to mention another example, felt that the search for power is what drives people.<br /><br />Victor Frankl had a totally different view. He felt that people are not moved by their subconscious or unconscious drives; but it is a sense of meaning and purpose in life that holds them together, and stops them from falling apart when they face trouble. People cannot escape suffering, but they can learn to cope with it and transcend it if they have proper thoughts and a sense of purpose.<br /><br />Frankl faced extreme trouble. He and his pregnant wife were placed in different concentration camps by the Nazis during the Second World War. His conditions in the camp were terrible. People around him lost their will to live, and they died. How did he survive? He survived by thinking about his reunion with his dear wife; the desire to reunite and the joy he expected to achieve in the reunion kept him alive. Frankl describes this in his book and tells how others can find meaning and what true meaning is. He calls this Logotherapy, based on the Greek \\"logos,\\" defined as \\"wisdom,\\" word,\\" \\"meaning.\\"<br /><br />Frankl's idea was mentioned in the twelfth century by Moses Maimonides who asked: The Bible mentions more than several times that God tested people, such as in Genesis 22, where it states that God tested Abraham to see if he loved God so much that he would even sacrifice his son Isaac if God commanded it? Maimonides was convinced that this episode never happened; it was a dream in which Abraham struggled whether he should follow the practices of his pagan neighbors who showed their love of God by sacrificing their children, and decided this was absurd.  And Maimonides asked: Does God need to test people to discover their nature? He answered that whenever the Bible states that God tested someone, it means that the person was faced with a struggle, suffering, and doubt and had to make a decision; the person was being tested by nature, not God. If people could find meaning in the struggle and devote themselves to the discovered purpose, they will have passed the test. Abraham passed the test by realizing that true love of God is demonstrated by respecting everything that God created and working to improve himself and society.<br /><br />Many people find meaning in religion. But unfortunately their concept of religion is passive. It does not encourage them to develop their minds, improve themselves, and help advance society - the three objects humans should strive to achieve.  A religion in which people focus on superstitions rather than work, one that is \\"an opiate of the masses,\\" may give them satisfaction, may even help them survive in adversity, but this is not enough. Thus reading Frankl's book should aid people develop significant and creative meanings in their lives.acrifice his son Isaac if God commanded it?

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Who isn't a fan of the Harry Potter books or films. Why wouldn't I buy this for myself. I think this is an awesome collection to have. Its entertaining & complete.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best book I've ever read, moving on to shift! Can't wait to get started! Thanks Hugh for a great read.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|I didn't think that I would be interested in this series at first. I changed my mind after the first film. This is a great set to have. Its entertaining & complete.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|Awesome that all the movies and extras are together. This is what I was waiting for to buy. Its also packaged pretty cool like a book. I am very happy with this order!  I also pre-ordered so I didn't pay all that much which was a bonus!
B00C5R71U8|5.0|Excellent book!!!!!! It is an outstanding description of Ive and his personality that it is immersed in all Apple products!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never knew what was coming, right up to the end.  I am not sure if the characters were sympathetic or not.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. It's fun and I find myself wanting to play it all the time. I just would love to have unlimited play time.
0812550706|5.0|Need a good political science fiction/ coming-of-age-is-for-sissies sort of book, with only minimal messianic overtones? Look no further. You will feel stupid and inadequate, you will attempt to harness your harbored adolescent feelings of rejection and hubris, seeking in this prepubescent protagonist all of those unfulfilled yearnings so easily transposed onto Harry Potter and friends. But for naught. Ender is a genius among geniuses, and you will stand back in awe at his story, which will either a) lead you to a state of semi-paranoia, sensing manipulative impetus behind every action, or b) tempt you into the frighteningly voracious megalomania of this tale's emotional and political predators.  The choice is yours. The ethical examinations in this book are staggering.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|It reminded me of the story Ann Frank.  I liked it because the detail of the story made the characters seem real.  The author made you feel like you was there with them in the war and against Hitler.
B008LXZEYU|2.0|this is NOT the original movie Anchorman, but, rather, a later (2004) straight-to-DVD &#34;companion film made up of outtakes and abandoned subplots&#34; - it is called &#34;Wake Up Ron Burgundy&#34; - a very bizarre situation! - hopefully, Amazon will correct this error soon
B0083Z614S|5.0|Had never read this before and I am really enjoying it. The story is great and love to read on my Kindle Fire
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The best mobile fighting game to date. Graphics are pleasing, and the action is nice and fast paced. The moves are very &quot;in character&quot; for this DC crowd and the challenge of future unlocks keeps things interesting.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|The soundtrack for Oblivion was engaging and following in a similar musical vein as Tron Legacy and Inception.  It has some strong tracks, but the overall soundtrack was not quite as good as I had hoped.
B00000099Y|5.0|Are you kidding?  The sonic magic of these guys is simply astounding.  Every song is awesome, and there are so many little cool side things going on.  Intricate guitar, awesome vocals and lyrics.  Pure rock art.  Danny's drumming alone is worth buying.  But it's their combined talent that makes it all turn into something great that will last through the ages.  Morons need not apply - if you're a pop addict, go buy some one-hit wonder.  These guys are too much for you.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I liked this season less than others, but it's not like I have a choice. I have to buy it. Satan compels me.
0736092269|5.0|I loved the earlier version of this book and I love this one, too.  It is a great way to understand which muscles are worked and how they are worked during various exercises.  I'm going to buy more from the series.
B00136RV66|5.0|Sometimes when I am just relaxing with a cup of coffee or Hot coco I just flip on the Original Soundtrack Dances With Wolves, and all my troubles goes away for the time being.
B005K17RU0|5.0|There are several weather apps that are pretty good. I've tried several of them. When I saw this one I thought I'd give it a try. It seems to be as good or better than any of the other ones. You can get hourly or daily forecasts and it will forward important storm warnings and advisories. Can't find any reason to not give it give stars.
B00DJ4PIBK|2.0|I have purchased the Lego Star Wars advent calendars for the past couple of years, and they always seem to have a neat little ship or mini figure each day. The Lego Friends advent calendar is nowhere near as good. It is only day six, but so far the set has produced 2 nice mini figures (that's the good part) 1 vehicle, not bad, and 3 worthless items. A snow mobile, not bad gives the mini figures something to do, A street lamp...really that will keep her entertained for hours I'm sure, a concession stand...looks like retail sales are the life these Friends characters aspire too, and a pile of translucent colored blocks to make what look like perfume bottles, I guess that's so they can pretend the mini figure smell good while selling concessions. I like the friends sets, and so does my daughter, but they really need to focus more on creativity and not just retail storefronts and background décor. If they are going to produce nothing but inanimate objects for each day of the calendar, at least make them Christmas themed.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Challenging, fun, this is a great app with nothing lacking - I play it a lot! You will enjoy it too, I'm sure...
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Too big, can't install.<br />If it ever install again, it wants another 1.5GB before I can play.<br />This app is the reason why I had to reset to factory my tablet..
1400052181|5.0|I first read this book several years ago and thought it was the perfect story of racial discrimination book I had ever read. I think it is a testimony to its author and her story telling abilities that it has been on the New York Times best seller list for a very long time.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I love this game.  But tonight it booted me out and won't let me back in.  I even downloaded it.  Please fix it.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|For most readers this book will explain much that is baffling in present society and in our own behavior.  Malcolm Gladwell's research-supported insights can transform daily life for the astute reader.
B002WY65VU|4.0|I had seen this on TV and really enjoyed it.  So much, that I was dropping lines of the movie in convo with my hubby, who did not get it when I would say things like, &#34;double tap!&#34; and how I lamented the loss of Twinkies, much like Woody Harrelson did.<br /><br />So, I finally bought him this movie so he could enjoy this post-zombie apocalypse humor too.  I hate to write a spoiler in case you haven't seen the movie, but the overall theme is one that shows that family --- however you define it --- is the most important aspect of life.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|Although this is definitrly a departure from The Strokes' other albums, this one is certainly worth the price. Every song sounds new and original, and my favorites include Machu Picchu, Life Is Simple In the Moonlight and Gratisfaction. Great album.
140006922X|5.0|This is a very good book. Worth the investment of time and money. I appreciate the historical perspective. A must read!!!
B001UG56ES|5.0|This film is unexpectedly an absolutely delightful film!  The story opens with such incredible visual beauty, the cinematographer must be given full credit for photographing the beautiful child, Nullah under water, absolutely magnificent photography.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was spectacular, as he always is, as the &#34;man's man&#34; and still charming, caring, charismatic and fully believable as the loner who comes to fall in love. Honestly, I've never been a huge Nicole Kidman fan, the whole ice queen bit being done a bit too well to my taste in a few films but here she is endearing, loving and as caring a mother as one could see. And, I must say, I became a &#34;Nicole fan&#34; after seeing this film. Her acting skills have truly been honed and she easily takes you into the film to see the beauty of the aboriginal people, their culture, her love and her relationships with Hugh and the other characters in the film.<br /><br />I was delighted with Shea Adams and I hope we see much more of him in future films.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|Amazed at how well the amplifier picked up. Just a bit inconvenient to handle--brings attention to user.  Great deal for the price!
B000002ETI|5.0|I loved this album. His voice sounds great (maybe because he was still young then) and some songs are soft and romantic and<br />others are livelier but all have very meaningful lyrics, surrounded all by beautiful music. I think that every Julio Iglesias fan should<br />have this CD in their collection. Great album!!!
0756655307|5.0|Some characters I'm shocked don't have more information on them in this book, like the character Deadpool, which has become decently popular. He has only a very small section in the book. But aside from that small complaint, it's very useful if you're into the comics or the movies and want a bit of info on a character you don't know much about, or if you just feel like discovering some older and unpopular characters that many people don't know about. As a huge Marvel fan, I adore it and it's also always great to pull out with many of my more geeky and comic loving friends who always spaz when they see it. I've had it for over a couple years now and still love it.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|A movie that does not take it self seriously.  Nothing worse than a movie that tries to be serious and funny at the same time.  e.g. Jeff Goldbum in Jerkasic Park.  One stupid one-liner after another.<br /><br />Yes, this movie had one-liners but they were well placed and flowed with the movie.  Take notice Jeff Goldbum.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Really fun to play, and also very quick. I can get in a 4 player game (3 computer opponents) finished before my lunch break ends. Easy to play, and being able to play with the River expansion is very nice.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Fast delivery and the disk was in better shape than hoped for from the used selection , will be back for more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I put off reading it for so long, but I can honestly say I'm glad I finally did. So beautiful.
0425263908|4.0|Great book if you love the fifty shades of grey books. The main women is a bit annoying but it gets better;)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I recommend to ages 15 and up.  It is still a Mature book, but kind of addicting!  Pretty gear you can listen on audio as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Another great way to pass the time while waiting for your wife to finish her shopping, or when you get bored being the passenger on a road trip or plane trip.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I play this game all the time, I really enjoy it, my boyfriend and I compete with it a lot. I wish it had more scenes
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is an absolute &#34;must read.&#34; It is life changing! It is full of wit and wisdom ... and it is extremely well written.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Has swag and is awesome I would recommend buying it  is awesome because I can talk with my friends on steam
0307271080|5.0|Adichie is a wonderful writer; I loved this story particularly for the point of view of an African woman sees African Americans, white Americans, academia, Liberals, Affluence... what a perceptive eye she has.
B00004RD54|5.0|One of Reeds best. If you have not listened to this album it is your loss. The world has lost a Great Artist. Musician to the very end.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Can't wait for Season 9!!! I've loved every season so far!!! One of me and my fiance's favorite Vampire/Supernatural shows!! :)
006202406X|5.0|Please keep in mind that I'm a very critical reader, and tend to nitpick at a lot of things while reading, especially if it's a series or trilogy. In fact, Divergent, while based on a neat concept, was so poorly written in my eyes that I weighed whether or not to even buy the other two books. The crappy teenage romance put me off, and I felt like deaths (Al, Tris' parents) were poorly explained and were a cheap attempt at drama rather than something that actually moved the plot along. Regardless,  I bought Insurgent, and devoured it in a matter or hours. I was so eager to finish the trilogy I bought Allegiant for my tablet so I could start it right away and wouldn't have to wait to go to the bookstore.<br />Now, after seeing the low ratings the third book had gotten in comparison to the other two, I was a bit wary and worried it would end unsatisfactorily. However, I was not disappointed. While I did sob through the last five chapters, and am sorely pained it ended like it did, I am in no way outraged like others seem to be. Taking into account the way the characters had developed throughout the previous two books, the things that happened were believable, albeit upsetting. The only thing I'm mad about is that the trilogy is over, and I'll have to find a new book to read, which I'm sure will pale in comparison to these. Really impressed and surprised by how well these books ended up being written, considering how much the first one disappointed me. Can't wait to see the film.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Loved this one! My 5 year old and I watch it together all the time! :) Usually sequels are disappointing, but this one was great!!
B007SGM084|1.0|This book is shallow, repetitive, boring; an insult to the intelligent reader. It is nothing more than an x-rated Harlequin Romance.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Can't wait to see the rest of Season 5! This is my all time favorite Vampire show!!! Me and my fiance's! We also love Supernatural and Angel!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's best. A multilayered and yet very cogently told tale with many legal twists and turns. I could not put it down once I started. A seventy year old white man in Mississippi  is terminally ill with cancer and commits suicide by hanging himself. His final act is to cut his two children from his will and leave 90% of his estate to his black female caregiver whom he has known only for 3 years. He also appoints a young, struggling lawyer in charge of making sure that his last wishes are carried out exactly. This leads to a huge legal battle with the the two children of his contesting the will. We get to know many colorful characters, savory and unsavory. Grisham builds up the characters beautifully and takes you through the story without missing a beat. The mystery is why the man left all of his wealth to a black woman whom he has only known for 3 years. There are a couple of clues early on and I had good notion well before the ending. It was still a very good read and I could not wait to find out if I was right. In a way I was sad the tale ended when it did and now I have to search for another book of equal caliber to keep me occupied. I highly recommend this book.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Didn't like it at all!! Was not even remotely as funny as the last two were. Was pretty let down.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The Girl That Kicked the Hornet's Nest is a fast paced action novel with many interesting characters. Once you start reading, you'll be tempted to read all night. Enjoyed it very much!
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Love love love Alfred Hitchcock movies!! They are classics, and it don't matter what kind of mood I'm in, I'm always willing and ready for some Alfred Hitchcock!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining love the historical parts and seeing all Dynamics between staff members and loyalty to the family they serve
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is the second one for me. Good value/price item. My original screen protector has a few scratches but this from being tossed around in my lunch box.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is the best game I have on my kindle. I've been playing it every day and I haven't had to use money for upgrades. I earn my upgrades every time. It been nice and I would recommend it to a friendThis
B001RTSPVY|5.0|unbelievable series!  Everything in it for a drama junkie - the acting and screenwriting surpasses most every other drama series I have watched.  Mary Poppins with the Sopranos would only come close!
B00867GHS8|5.0|A well done classically pixar style film.  The whole family will enjoy this films humor and touching story about a Dad and his son
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Suprised me. At first I thought I was not going to like it but like the Shining, it built up to the end. Now I enjoyed it very much.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am not a fast reader, but I read all three books in a week.  Loved them immensely!  Have not seen any of the movies, not sure they will be as good as the books
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is fun though there r times when it doesn't play honestly when you go to jump the screen will jerk so u get the monkey other times u try to get artifacts once again jerks so u lose it really sometimes posses u off
B001DJLD1M|4.0|People like me interested in this theme will enjoy these Matrix dvds. My 4-year old grandson stayed awake all the time watching the dvds.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Much better than watching it on cablevision.<br />Very hard to stop watching till the end...<br />It's very hard to get up in the morning, next time I will be watching from Friday night and sleep over the week end.
0740745271|5.0|This book definitely helped me improve my vision.  I was even dreaming in 3D.  The pictures have so many layers.
B005ER2RIW|5.0|Great survival book with easy to understand instructions. Huge amount of information about all aspects of survival. I definitely would recommend this book.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|For 80 bucks, this scanner does as good a job as can be expected.  The colors reproduce faithfully, but there is a noticeable reduction in resolution from the original slide.  The Kodachrome slide film which I used in the 1950's, was very fine grained, so with a good camera and lens, the images were quite sharp.  This scanner cannot reproduce that sharpness, but for the price, should not be expected to.  The imaging sensor is 5 MP with interpolation to 10 MP in the &#34;High res&#34; mode.  The scanner is fast and easy to use, but a pair of tweesers comes in handy to remove the slide from the slot.<br />This unit should serve most people's needs well, but if you are looking for the highest resolution, plan on paying a considerable amount of money for a more professional scanner.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is an amazing game and finally excited that it is out. The graphics were better than i had expected it to be.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very interesting book. Characters devloped real well. It kept my interest to the end.I would reccommend it  to anyone who likes John Grisham.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is the best I will never get bord In my life and if u can't download the game u need to clear some space.
B00007L4OM|4.0|This is a unique film--a detective movie with heart.  Jean Reno is excellent as the detective who travels to Japan on a police case and ends up enriching his life.  Also, the film is set in France and Japan, a welcome change from the usual LA or NY.  This movie is a definite &#34;must&#34; for Jean Reno fans and for everyone who likes films that end on an upbeat note.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great read from John Grishom. Would like to see more of the same. I'd recommend it to any courtroom addict.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|This is an amazing hard to find CD for an all instrumental band.  There's really nothing more than rocking guitars in this.  It's an amazing CD and I highly recommend picking this up.  You'll love it from the first listen.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Very nice game to play when you're bored. I like the spot the difference best. It's a little repetitive though...
B008JFUPFI|3.0|I thought it would fit my screen, but it's a long rectangle across the middle with a black line of the same size on bottom and top - just not what I wanted, but I love the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game so much. its so fun so entertaining. all I hate is the waiting on lives part. other than that all my friends and family love playing it. I hope they add more stuff to it to make it an app that lasts forever...
B000JMKTLO|4.0|When Camille Preaker returns to her hometown in Wind Gap, Missouri, to report on the murders of two little girls, the memories of her childhood come flooding back to her, and are intertwined with the story. This is an interesting thriller that takes a few twists and turns, and involves some pretty unlikely scenarios. Good, but not as good as Gone Girl.
0061122416|5.0|I really liked this book because it is a very interesting and deep. I would recommend this book to people that are looking for a very good short read! This book is about a boy who starts the book as a Shepherd then goes on to be a crystal glass apprentice and much much more. He then meets a king the tells him about a treasure in Egypt. He is a hard working person that will do anything to accomplish his goals in life.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is easy to download.  You can also apply to be a Beta tester for tablets if you want too.  The graphics are nice and works well on our tablet.  Worth the time to get.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|My favorite kind of book is one that has me caring about the characters even while I'm not reading it.  And this was one of those books.  Even though it was somewhat predictable it kept my interest from the beginning to the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We love this game.  I downloaded this on our tablet.  No issues downloading or playing the game.  The graphics are right on.  Can't wait to play it again.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Despite knowing how it must basically end you start to question it as you near the end.<br /><br />It had been a few years since I read any of the other books in the series. There was no need to re-read them as this book brings you back to the wheel of time quickly and completely.<br /><br />The ending is a good payoff for making it this far in the series. A great end.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Now who doesn't like to laugh.  This is a funny and well made movie for the entire family.  You have to see it.  It came right on time and I  had no issues with the packaging or the CD.  Worth every penny.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion run because it great for my cousin he loves it. most people in my family loves it a lot
0451419243|5.0|As educational as it was entertaining.  Also enjoyed &#34;Fall of the Giants&#34;.  And can't wait for the third book in the trilogy.  Nobody teaches history quite like Follett.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I think they have a good selection of dresses,hair and other things like that libii games are pretty good for girly-girls I'm kinda a mix
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Good acting, interesting plot and quality characters!!  :). I would definitely recommend watching this show if you like courtroom drama combined with politics!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app has created more space on my kindle fire that I really needed. I couldn't download anything until used this. thanks!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After watching two seasons, i'm hooked. It has my interest, am going to watch season 3 and am looking  forward to season 4 when it comes out in January.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Baldacci has done it again.  Love King and Maxwell.  They've never been better than this book.can't wait for the next one.
B00DNV9V1W|4.0|Dificult to install perfectly as all screen protectors are for me, so good thing there are three in the package as it took me two trys to get it on correctly with no dust. Quality seems good and it is cut out for the Sprint Galaxy S4 mini perfectly. Same smudge problem as most other screen protectors, but easy enough to wipe off and I would rather have this problem than a scratched screen. Overall recommended accessory.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Weird creepy book. This follows several different people as they encounter a strange happenings at mile 81 on the interstate. In true to King fashion the story is character driven. Each chapter is a new character and each one is horrific.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This works really well and I am happy to be able to use this on the go!  I have had no problems using it.
0618680004|5.0|Very well written although he does get a bit carried away near the end.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|excellant reading.  full of suspense to the very end.  You knew how it would end, of course, but the getting there was a good. read.
B007SGM084|3.0|Prefered the Ann Rice - Sleeping Beauty Trilogy.  I guess I need 12 more words, because I can't make a statement unless it meets their guidelines.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I have become  addicted to this game! It's not easy, yet each game can be won with persistence and thought. All of the cards are laid out, and you can only move one card at a time in theory, using the free spaces as needed, to alternate black to red in the  columns until ultimately the cards are all placed in suits aces to kings in the ace spaces. It is tricky. There is an undo button for mistakes. If you like card games, I recommend this one.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This game is really fun I have always wanted to run over people but now it's legal lol jk but seriously it's a fun game
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Lots of fun. I really like the auto feature so I don't have to drag the cards. I recommend it to everyone.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It made me laugh ,it made me cry!  It held me and brought back a lot of memories of a simpler time!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I like the books over the TV show. Great characters. Amazing writer. How does he do it!  Moving on to the next book.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app teaches based on recall, using simple phrases and a few pictures.  I have been able to self-teach a few words in German already.  The only thing it's missing IMO is maybe a section on conjugation.  This app is a keeper.
0375822429|5.0|This was my son's favorite bedtime story when he was little.  It is a delightful and devilishly humorous book.  We moved a while back and the book was lost.  My now grown son screamed with delight when he opened this replacement book on Christmas Eve.  No doubt he will read this book to his children.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|To play whenever you want. It's mean. You have to wait to get my turns or pay to play. Ridiculous.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it so awesome. it is so fun. I love it .it must be played.<br />will you play it. it is free.it is fun.
B008200LHW|5.0|Tested ok. I found lots of satelites with it in the plant window. I havent run the software to use the maps. Ed
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I loved it & can't wait til it comes out on Blu-ray!<br /><br />I'd say that I can't wait for 7, but I'm gonna be truly sad watching it. We lost Paul Walker way too soon...
B00E95ED32|5.0|This CD, True, is as advertised! A blend of light rock/disco/country/bluegrass. An unusual blend of music styles that works according to my music tastes!
B0002HWO82|5.0|My son, got a kick out of the fact the little Smurf had a laptop, chair. Great toy for him.,no complaints.
B00EVN3JNM|4.0|watching the movie in the theaters 1st time around really left a good impression on me that I decided to grab this one and watch it again. 2nd time watching it, left me kinda like ok. It's not that amusing at it was 1st time around. I thought this movie would be entertaining on the 2nd time around but unfortunately the magic was gone.<br />Overall, its a good movie but having seen it once was I think good enough for me. Any case I still like the movie.
B00FCAK12A|3.0|Pretty much the same album, with a few extra songs that dont really make a difference.  But its good to support the band.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I didn't realize I would like this movie... quite entertaining... thumbs up!<br />overall it was a well made movie to entertain you for the evening.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|The creators of the original Flow--I think they are Big Duck Games and Noodlecake Games--did a much better job in my opinion. Obviously this is a knockoff so you can't expect much but it's okay. I haven't the problems that other reviewers have had--Facebook problems and all that--but the game is, personally, simply okay. Hence the three stars. It's not worth the 99 cents; just get the free version.
B002SAS26E|5.0|Love this game. It is exactly what I was looking for in a two player game. A quick game, with easy rules, but with some solid strategy. Each game takes 10 minutes but the rules say you should play best of 3, so that is why the length says 30 minutes. It could be quicker if you want to play 1 quick game.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|All the little pets are so quite. I love this game. My favorite is the ween dog cause I have two of them.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was one of the best zombie thrillers I've ever seen/read. The story focuses not on the zombies, but on humanity and how the global community copes with the destruction of modern society. It's great!
B003B02O0A|5.0|A time to kill is a good book that was very well written with a lot of suspence  never a dull moment sind a good ending.
B000KGGLCU|1.0|Well, I LOVE Madonna and the Confessions Tour, however, this DVD was formatted for European DVD players. I am not able to use this purchase. The post says nothing about the continental DVD formatting. Very displeased.
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|It's great if you love the flip option but it has a quick wear and tear life. It's already breaking apart but function is pretty good
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Excellent read! I've always known I am an introvert and knew that that meant that I need to recharge in quiet place for some part of every day. This book highlighted several other habits and/or traits of introverts that I just assumed were my own personal quirks that I had to \\"deal with.\\" There is empowerment in that knowledge that helps me feel a bit more comfortable in my own skin. More than this, the book is extremely well written and well researched. Cain works through much of the literature in evolutionary biology, anthropology, sociology, and psychology in order to help us understand and explain introversion (as well as extroversion). I honestly could not put the book down.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|I own all of the holiday Barbies. They are all so very beautiful. This is another must have for collectors.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This is a very challenging game. I would recommend this game to other friends. Thank you!<br />How u try this game.
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|I so love Vin Diesel especially in his cool bad ass Riddick role. Loved this movie hope they make more sequels. Don't want to tell too much and ruin the movie for others. I believe everyone should watch movies for themselves and not rely on others to tell them if movies are good or not. Saw the movie can't wait to own it on blu ray. I am on waiting list for it's release :D  Please make more can't get enough of Riddick : D
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is great if you have netflix or if you want to watch youtube videos on your TV. It's easy to setup and you can control with an Android phone, iOS device, or your PC. Google just needs to release the SDK so more apps can take advantage of it.  There currently are about 7.
B00122K35M|5.0|The sax on this album is tremendous.  It takes me back to the old days!  The quality could not be better.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Purchased it for a Christmas gift. I liked it because it is the complete series.  I sure she will love it.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|It's a nice game.easy to jump right in and start playing.the graphics are good considering the platform.I would recommend it.
B0090SI582|5.0|I really like the wolverine movie because it had a awesome storyline and there was some good action. Wolverine is always awesome!<br />Really different.
B00F2HW1YY|5.0|Superb writing, playing and recording. Real music by real musicians. Music that doesn't require dance choreography or involve angry shouting to get its point across.
B000003TA4|5.0|As most will probably agree this is one of the greatest albums ever made. The shipment was on time and the CD was what was expected. Monkey see Monkey do.
B00FVZJYK6|4.0|Solid follow-up to the first. My grandkids love it and the minions crack me me up every time. Entertaining family movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just another game of solitaire, play and have fun it does have a speed game witch is fun as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This book is not for the faint of heart, but is right in line with current issues. As racism is battled in the streets and in \\"Obama's\\" politics; John Grisham brings this topic to life through an engaging historical courtroom drama. Done in his usual gripping style with last minute surprises, you will not be disappointed. I only wish the ending had been brought to more of a close instead of leaving you hanging; but surely another Grisham success.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|As the title says its free so I got it. It works as it should and I have no complaints.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|A good follow up to A Time to Kill. The ending s a little understated and can be easily guessed about 2/3 way through but the overall story was well written and holds your interest. Once again the characters are very engaging and control the story. Nice job Mr. Grisham.
B00BEK6Z7M|1.0|Didn't care for it.<br />Not to my taste<br />Hard to follow. Too many characters.  Had to be looking up definition too much
B0055PMJMW|5.0|These stories do nothing but make the reader want more of Harry Bosch. Michael Connelly continues to write the absolute best character based stories in the business. I would recommend all of the Bosch books as one or ten is simply not enough.
B003L77GG0|5.0|The perfect wrap up for an outstanding TV series.<br /><br />Lois' management of the knowledge of Clark's secrets is one of the most amazing things in this 10th season.<br />The series finale is one of the most emotive ones I've ever seen.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Just not my forte really. It is kind of interesting, but just didn't grab my attention. That doesn't mean it is bad, but, just okay for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|kept interest, well written, would recommend it to my family and friends who like well-written books, author did a good job
0307477479|1.0|Couldn't get into it, tried 3 times.  Never finished reading it.  Boring boring boring.  I finally gave it away, happily.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|To expected in some aspects. Very well written and graphic in areas I didn't expect. I would recommend this boom
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Having the ability to watch HBO Go on a TV as opposed to my laptop when I travel is great!! With HBO Go and Netflix I'm set, but  having more services supported by it would always be a plus. Installation is quick and simple and the set-up afterwards is just as easy.<br /><br />The only issue I've encountered has been using my phones hot spot + my girlfriends phone as the streaming device. The chromecast wouldn't complete the set-up process; I had to switch the streaming device from her phone to my laptop so it could complete the set up.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE!!<br /><br />The story of Travis and Abby is a great read and is written quite well. Travis – “Maddox” is rough, wild and incredibly sexy. Abby is a good girl trying to put some distance between her current and life and her dark past.  What Abby finds with Travis makes for a good love story, but I found that I both loved and hated these characters. Pulling the two together over a “bet” wasn’t as engaging as it could have been. I wasn’t really sure I appreciated their complicated attraction. The sexual tension that builds through the first half of the book is captivating, but I was not fond of how beating someone to a pulp was glamorized. The second half of book is a bit rushed, and I believe portrayed drinking and illegal fight clubs as hip. I can’t decide if their love story was truly beautiful, or like watching something so dysfunctional it is hard to look away. The story gets high marks for strong dialogue and fantastic supporting characters. This always brings life to the main characters. Even though I wasn’t fond of the way Travis and Abby meet, this is quality story-telling with a well-crafted plot. There is a great deal of passion and suspense which ignites interest. I enjoyed my happily ever after ending and will read the retell.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a wonderful game that helps me with my concentration i recommend it for everyone it is also very addictive.<br />  ITS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!
B00FCAK12A|5.0|First off, I believe 5 stars represent a masterpiece. I see 5 star ratings thrown around followed by reviews that make it sound like a 3 or 4 star product. I just try to reserve the highest ratings for releases that truly deserve it.<br /><br />I'm not gonna write a book about this one. If you are familiar with it then you already know how good it is. All I'll say is that if the production was something that you thought could improve what is already excellent, then you should buy this. If you are not concerned with sound quality then I would pass. Personally, I think the music itself is flawless. I could have lived with the original mix for all of my days as well. However, this new mix is phenomenal. It's like listening to this again for the first time.<br /><br />The documentary is also worth checking out. It's nice to have some insight on the original process for this album and why the band felt compelled to have it remixed and remastered.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Definitely not worth your time.  Nothing of any substance here.  You definitely get what you pay for with this one!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|We like it. Very nice. Good graphics. Fast paced.<br />Like the new version. Like like like like the the. More animals plz
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It worked for what I bought it for. Was easy to install. It was priced less than if I bought it from an electronics store.
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|Pretty head banging. 5 songs great, 4 so-so, 4 mediocre at best. I thought i might see the softer side of Phil in several of the custs but that didn't happen....
1451666179|4.0|I ordered paperback and the pages are quite thick, it looks and feels like a quality printing. Stories are super fun, more extended than the online comics, drawings are hilarious!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game so much I have almost all the sharks you can evolve your shark to make him bigger and to unlock the next shark great game.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Lost opportunity!  Sorry but this just does not make sense if compared with alien.  Great effects but story v.dissapointing, and the lead is just annoying.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|Best Media player out there period.<br />Easy to access video files with clear HD quality accompanied by dual software capabilities enabling to play a wide array of media files
B005LAII1C|4.0|Almost died laughing!<br /><br />My wife did not appreciate the language though - esp  comming from a cuddly teddy bear .
B008JFLWLE|1.0|I first thought this was an amazing app because of what you could do. But there are so many flaws in the programming its useless
B0014C0BMU|2.0|After the matrix - what a disappointment.<br /><br />Such potential, but goes off on the most pretentious I fathomable arch possible
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of the most fun and challenging puzzle games I have played in a long time.  Keep up the good work.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Peter jackson - you should be ashamed!  Oh the gall of this guy!  How can you turn such a wonderful book into a 9 hour/3 film snooze fest!  Heads should roll as this is just such a blatant, arrogant Money grab  Lord of the rings I can cope with, but this is such a simple story.  Needed no embellishments at all.  Will not be partaking in the rest!
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Yes, this is one of Connelly's best books yet.  A blazing page turner of the first degree.  I totally recommend this book.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Great enthralling story.  Not sure how close to real events, but it dies keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The climax is particularly effective
B00GMONG90|5.0|I just recently discovered Pentatonix, and went and watched lots of videos and ending up buying this album and the Christmas album. I can't believe the group is just five people using nothing but their voices to create all this incredible music. If you watch the videos, they switch off between the different singers to take advantage of their strengths. This makes for arrangements that are quite complex, but they pull it off with ease. But there is so much more. The quality of the harmonies are beautiful, the versatility and range are impressive, and the effects produced by their voices is just plain unbelievable. I mean, I keep wondering how they heck they do it! Have they been surgically altered or something? Just watch the music video for Daft Punk and you'll understand.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Great movie...you will not look at food the same again. Good information. Must see. I have passed it around to family and friends
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Cornwell has allowed her political views to affect her character development, forcing characters to act out of character to advance her personal agenda.
B00821OX98|4.0|An interesting story line with pretty good character development.  Some of the dialogue and special effects came off as a bit cheesy, but still a good enough show that you'll want to keep watching if you're a sci-fi or apocalypse story fan. Has a &#34;hopeful&#34; air about it, versus some other apocalypse stories that portray the idea that all is lost, so this is a slightly more upbeat end of the world (as silly as that sounds.)<br /><br />Give it a try, it's a pretty solid series that keeps me coming back for more.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I AM A FAN OF BRUCE WILLIS AND HIS FAST MOVING ACTION PACKED MOVIES.<br />HE IS A GOOD ACTOR AND IT ALWAYS SEEMS BELIEVABLE.

B004TRKH9O|3.0|The VCS3 was a small but highly programmable synthesizer in the early 70's and allowed you to make a wide range of strange if not particularly musical sounds. It was easy to make beeps, rumbling drones, bees buzzing, strange bells, unearthly trills, grinding rhythmic noises and a very convincing water splashing sound. It was not so easy to make popular music with it but that was clearly not Tangerine Dream's intention with this album.<br /><br />The first side &#34;Birth of Liquid Plejades&#34; stands out as being mostly musical. It begins with what sounds like cellos unable to stay in tune. Every note that implies a melody is quickly cut off with a conflicting note. The second section is mostly Florian Fricke playing a single long note on his Moog briefly interrupted by other quick notes causing an echo effect (this trick is used a few too many times) while Froese slowly grinds notes on a highly processed guitar. The piece ends with ex-member Steve Schroyder playing organ chords but not in any order that implies a musical progression. In fact the cut just suddenly ends mid-chord. Maybe that's when Schroyder was fired.<br /><br />The last three sides of Zeit sounds like a Tangerine Dream notebook of the most interesting sounds they were able to coax out of their new VCS3s, organs and Froese's guitar effects. There are attempts to bookend the songs with a theme. &#34;Nebulous Dawn&#34; starts with a &#34;braaaap&#34; sound announcing its beginning along with some nice vibraphone but falls into waves of dissonant electronic sounds (sounds like the VCS3 ring modulator) with little structure. &#34;Origin of Supernatural Probabilities&#34; begins with a mournful melody and a spooky breathing sound in the background which fades into Froese playing similar mournful chords through a barely recognizable guitar. After this promising beginning, the track becomes another showcase of VCS3 drones and random organ sounds. The title track starts with an ominous drone and Froese sliding chords into deep echos. The tuneless drone expands, contracts, moves around, and slowly changes through the piece giving the track a uniform if intentionally monotonous sound. The rest is mostly Froese sliding dissonant chords and notes on his guitar through countless echo units and reverb. It ends with a few vibraphone notes that almost sound pretty before suddenly ending.<br /><br />What makes Zeit timeless is that despite all the electronic noise, it doesn't sound very dated. It sounds nothing like the simple clichéd bleeps and bwops that has makes much of the electronic music of the 70's hard to listen to now. Tangerine Dream somehow managed to avoid falling into these traps by selecting the most complicated and interesting sounds and carefully mixing them with appropriate amounts of echo and reverb to disguise their origins and not even attempting to pass it off as music. At first the pieces sound unstructured but repeated listenings show that a remarkable amount of effort was made to select and mix sounds together and organize them in some way that sounds interesting although it's impossible to say why.<br /><br />After listening to it for another month, perhaps I should give Tangerine Dream more credit for having the guts to create a double album that completely defies all conventions of song structure. Except for some bookends there is no real melody. Except for Schroyder's organ in one song there is no real rhythm. Still, this wasn't a lazy collection of random electronic noises. Maybe it was the equivalent of giving conventional rock music the middle finger.<br /><br />I can imagine Klaus Schulze recording the similar Irrlicht by himself but I can't imagine how three band members came to decisions about how each piece on Zeit should go. They must have had pages of notes to keep track of the VCS3 programming since there is little repetition. Did they start with one improvised layer and add subsequent layers of noise? Did they argue over which buzzingdrone sounded more appropriate or that one sound wasn't loud enough in the mix? How three people could make an album like this is almost as mysterious as the sound itself.<br /><br />There are a number of recordings at the Free Music Archive like Ambient Fabric, Noise Research, Phopha, Subterrestrial that feature droning electronic sounds and puzzling indecipherable audio clips into a form similar to Zeit and they're free. Any similarities to music are purely accidental.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! So far my favorate download. Once I get into the game- I can't stop playing. Lots of fun.
B007XF4J70|1.0|The disk has nothing on it.  I don't remember who I ordered it from; thus, I can't send it back for a refund.  I love the movie, but the disk doesn't have the movie on it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is amazing it is challenging and fun for that whole family this game makes you have fun and keeps.you comingnback for more
B006FE83U4|5.0|The Book is always better.  Nonetheless, my students and I viewed it after reading the book.   The &#34;streaming&#34; aspect was a problem...occasionally, it ran just fine, and sometimes the words were way behind the screen, and sometimes the words &#34;chattered&#34; because of slow transmission.  We are glad we watched it because we then discussed why the director omitted scenes and how he merged parts into one scene.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I really like Gerard Butler as an actor, he does a good job. He taught the young man great lessons in life.
0385340540|1.0|I've read three Grisham books lately and been disappointed by them all.<br /><br />Each has got off to quite a good start but then gone downhill within a chapter before dragging on to a feeble conclusion that might as well have ended with: \\"And they all lived happily ever after\\".<br /><br />This one is about a renegade lawyer who is given a presidential pardon a third of the way through a 20-year jail sentence and then  whisked off to Italy by the CIA where he is being set up to be murdered by the secret services of three countries seeking revenge.<br /><br />OK, it's just a thriller so we can't expect realism but Grisham insults the reader not only by his lazy approach to storytelling but also basic fact checking.<br /><br />For example, we are supposed to believe that the outgoing president's chief of staff can be run over in London with no investigation. For someone who specializes in the legal area, Grisham doesn't seem to know that under English law a public inquest would have been held following the accident.<br /><br />He refers to the American embassy in Milan although it is in Rome. He tells us that Zug is between an hour and two hours from Zurich and gives the taxi price in euros when it is about 30 minutes and the Swiss franc is still used in Switzerland.<br /><br />Instead of entertaining the reader, he tries to provide atmosphere by plundering guide books, giving descriptions of museums and churches and even presents pages of Italian lessons and \\"dialogue\\" as characters order meals.<br /><br />There's also almost a page of instructions on how to operate a gadget to send e-mail. I reckon about 15% to 20% of this book consist of this padding.<br /><br />Like virtually every modern American crime writer, the story is lubricated by coffee that is drunk or mentioned on every page.<br /><br />He talks about \\"Red China\\" as though we were still living in the 1950s and devotes several pages to a top Chinese assassin who never actually appears.<br /><br />How Grisham gets away with this poor quality material is a mystery.ow Grisham gets away with this poor quality material is a mystery.
0307476073|1.0|I have never written a book review before, but I so intensely loathe this book and author that I felt it was worth doing.<br /><br />The sad part is, I used to love her. I subscribed to her Sugar On the Rumpus column and really enjoyed reading it. I was very excited to get this book. However, after reading her self-indulgent, narcissistic drivel of a memoir, I honestly can't imagine ever reading another word she writes.<br /><br />I also have hiked the PCT, and I lost a beloved parent in my early twenties. In fact, I've been through a number of similar traumas to Strayed. What I didn't do to recover was libel my entire immediate family, murder a horse, or wallow in self-pity for YEARS. I also didn't make up my own name to tell everyone what a narcissistic, self-important and consumed human being I am. Further, as a woman who loves long solo-hikes, I have zero respect for people who take them on unprepared. That doesn't make you brave; it makes you stupid and a danger to yourself and others. Also as a female hiker, being alone and a woman does not entitle you to special treatment or some sort of rock-star status. I meet tons of other solo women hiking. I would like to believe that they are all less self-important than the author.<br /><br />This book is a perfect example of what trash some memoirs can be. Simply because an author is willing to compose a tell-all and publish every one of their most depraved actions, doesn't mean that it's worth writing or publishing. It certainly doesn't guarantee a journey of self-discovery. Unlike a lot of the other 1 star reviews here, I did finish the book. I can honestly say that from first page to last, the author demonstrates nothing other than that she's a terrible human being.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I enjoyed this album, because is it had the feel of a modern take on the classic metal sound from the '80s and early '90s. I think it takes a lot of guts for a band like A7X to take a step backward to create new music, but I think they really pulled it off.
B000EXZI14|5.0|Love. Love, love , this album. I wore out the first one I had.  The songs just make me happy!
1878424505|5.0|This book lays a solid foundation of the &#34;rules of the road&#34; for life in general, and while it incorporates the thinking from multiple religious beliefs, it's principal's have a practical application and approach to living a blessed life, regardless of your belief system.  The agreements just make sense and can be applied to all situations we may encounter, both work and personal - Check it out!
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Awesome calendar that syncs between my pc, phone and Kindle Fire.  There are a few &#34;annoying&#34; bugs but they're the kind of thing that one might expect to see in a newer product.  And, the kind of thing that one can probably expect to see resolved over a short time period.  An example would be if you setup a recurring event and then mark one of them complete, the calendar marks them all complete.  But, other than these few minor things, it's awesome so far.  I was looking for a calendar that would sync between devices and remind me of events on my phone.  The Jorte fits that bill and then some.  I would certainly recommend the download.
0307730700|5.0|Fantastic story of a warrior's life and what he gave for his country and family.  Make's one rethink what a tough situation really is.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|It had just the right mix of suspense and intrigue. Then of course there was the Brad Pitt factor. You can never go wrong with Brad. Not just because he looks sooooo good but because he is in a position where he can demand only the best parts in his films.
B0083XZ3KI|5.0|Again, Castle doesn't fail to intrigue.  This book is a real page-turner.  The way the characters are entwined keep you guessing what's going to happen - not only the main focus of the book but the relationship between Nikki and Rook.  Can't wait to read the next installment.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Made to attract hollywood producers. Real ops are similar but more real as far as human factor is involved. No matter perceptions, stereotypes, and training
B0019X3YXM|5.0|My daughter loves, loves, loves this movie. I looked for it in stores and could not find it. She was thrilled when we found it on Amazon.
B0046ECJBY|4.0|Excellent !! Recomended even if you don't care on politics and history , especially the 5 first chapters give a very precise approach on how Chinese are looking and managing foreigners and westerners
B000PMG16U|5.0|This was a great movie at a great price. My husband is a fan. Amazon is definitely the place to go to look for movies at reasonable prices.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This book is very well written.  The story is of a perfectly ordinary life and I am always in awe of authors who can make me want keep reading about the mundane. Apparently, &#34;Stoner&#34; has a revival in popularity every 30-40 years and I hope that continues.

B004X1D3TC|5.0|This is probably a very good 2nd book to read when you want start managing a project in an agile fashion. The first one is any introductory book, although my preference is to Ken Schwaber's \\"Agile Project Management with Scrum\\". If you want to read an elaborate review of Mike Cohn's book, please see [...]

B006XF5BTG|4.0|Mike Matthews Bigger Leaner Stronger has a lot of good information in it.  It's concise, to the point, and the chapters are short.  It's an easy read and I think that's a good thing.  Mike doesn't bog you down with tons of extra information and his workout philosophy makes complete sense once you wrap your head around it (because it's different from the millions of exercise routines that you read about each month in fitness mags).  I've just started incorporating his lifting technique so I can't comment to any gains specifically yet, but I'm excited to see how I progress.<br /><br />If there's one negative to the book, it's that Mike makes a couple of broad statements that may be off-putting.  Specifically, he mentions that &#34;ALL bodybuilders are on steroids&#34; and that &#34;Personal trainers don't know anything&#34;.  Now, I've no doubt that if you were having a conversation with Mike and he mentioned this you wouldn't bat an eye, but in print it sticks out a little.  I don't care personally, but I could see where someone reading those statements could think &#34;Who the [blank] is this guy?!&#34; and may stop reading.  Which would be a shame because I think the book has a lot of valuable information.<br /><br />I've got the kindle edition and for a few bucks this is well worth the pick up.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|hilarious I thought it wld get dull and boring<br />but it had the kind of humor only this actor can provide.<br />great movie after a rough day at work!!
B00H455UKE|5.0|Amazing graphics! Very realistic mechanics! A must have for beginner sailors. This is a great balance between a simulator and a game.

B00GX50BD2|3.0|The movie was okay. I learned about a lot of factual traits, about Steve Jobs and how Apple came to being. The movie was kind of slow and really didn't really hold your interest.
0385737955|5.0|If you're like me, you've had friends telling you to read The Maze Runner for years. You know you should listen to them, but other books always seem to jump ahead on your To Read list. Perhaps you've been waiting for the price on the Kindle or Nook version to drop. It might be that you pushed it aside to read City of Bones or The Fault in Our Stars or Divergent before the movie comes out. Or maybe you're #72 in the reservation queue at the library. Well, I'm here to tell you to stop making excuses (the Kindle price is only $6.99, the movie comes out in February 2014, and switch the library listing to the large print or audio versions, the wait for those is usually shorter) and pick up a copy of this book. Also, you have very smart friends.<br /><br />Part of the trouble might be that The Maze Runner is difficult to explain in a few sentences, which generally isn't something I like about a book. Not that I like boring or uncomplicated books, but if the basics can't be distilled into a few sentences, what I like to think of as a verbal movie trailer, it makes it a hard sell when I'm recommending it to my students (and adults for that matter). But because I know you will love this engrossing and entertaining book as much as I did, here's my attempt...<br /><br />  Thomas wakes up in an elevator-like contraption with no memory of his life. Sort of. He can remember what snow is, but not who he might have built a snowman with. He can remember what a forest is, the names for animals, and how foods taste, but not how old he is. He knows there is an outside world, but he can't remember anything about it. His memory is wiped clean. Once out of the box, he enters into the world of the Glade - a Lord of the Flies-esque society made up entirely of teenage boys whose memories have also been wiped (if they're lucky). As he acclimates to his new surroundings, Thomas feels drawn to certain people and tasks, but he's not sure how or why. There is a constantly changing, seemingly unsolvable maze. There are terrible creatures. There are terrible people. And there is mystery. Lots and lots of mystery.<br /><br />The mystery and uncertainty is one of the things Dashner does so well in this book. Yes, the characters are great. Some of the boys are are frustrating (especially in the beginning) and some of them are annoying (Chuck, I'm looking at you) and some of them are likable (I adore Newt and Minho), but all of them are believable and, like Thomas is, you're never quite sure who you should trust. Yes, the story is intriguing (difficult to do in the currently over-saturated dystopian genre), but it's all the not-knowing that I loved. And the mystery of the Glade is shown, versus told, through the boys' actions, their whispers, their flat out refusal to explain ANYTHING to Thomas, and the finer details of their smooth-on-the-surface society.<br /><br />Was I able to predict most of what happened? Yes, but this book's recommended audience starts at 6th or 7th grade. Did it matter that I saw some things coming? Not in the least, I still loved the book. So seriously, no more excuses. Go get this book and don't say I didn't warn you, after the first third you won't be able to put it down. And don't kill me over the ending - this is the first in a series, so nothing is tied up in a nice, smart bow at the end.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|Coming off a long reading hiatus, this book was the perfect one to bring me back to my bookish happy place. Not only did the descriptive title and fun cover scream out my name, but also the promising reviews and intriguing summary. “Fangirl” is a coming of age story that those of us who have a little geek in us can relate to.<br /><br />Cath (Cather) and Wren are twin sisters embarking on that journey called College, only Wren is the only twin sister that is excited about it. Having always been together and sharing everything since their birth, Cath is a little distressed about the fact that her sister Wren wants to explore beyond twin-hood and doesn’t want to room with her. Wren being the outgoing twin and Cath being the total opposite, made for some lonely and depressing days (and nights) for Cath. She no longer had her sister by her side to tell everything to or to be the one to depend on, and meanwhile Wren was having the time of her life with a social calendar that put any socialite to shame.<br /><br />I felt especially connected to Cath in this story because she personified the geek in me who loves books and fangirls over things that others may find trivial. Cath is a fan fiction writer that enjoys a lot of popularity online, but unfortunately, her social skills lack when it comes to making connections outside of the web. Her obsession with “Simon Snow”, the hero in the fictional books Cath writes fan fiction about, and “Baz”, Simon Snow’s archenemy and love interest, has taken over her life in such a way that she would rather live in this fictional world that the books’ author created and that Cath so passionately has transformed via her fan fiction.<br /><br />Cath is put in many situations where she has to decide between making her fan fiction fans happy, taking care of her mentally unstable father, talking sense into her borderline alcoholic sister, or snap her laptop shut and look at what’s been waiting in front of her all along. I’d have to say that my second favorite character would have to be Levi, the boy who can’t seem to stop being overly nice to everyone, because that’s just his nature, and he’s perfectly happy being that way.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves contemporary literature or just wants to plain indulge their inner geek. Rainbow Rowell’s writing is amazing and has a way of making you fall in love with her characters. I will definitely be reading more from this author. In a rating scale of 1-5, I give this book 4 stars.d have to say that my second favorite character would have to be Levi, the boy who can’t seem to stop being overly nice to everyone, because that’s just his nature, and he’s perfectly happy being that way.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves contemporary literature or just wants to plain indulge their inner geek.

B0028T6XXY|4.0|When travelling it is enjoyable, A great addition to my collection.  Relaxing while waiting for someone to show up or a good reason to just sit back.
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a fascinating book about a remarkable man. The author made us feel Tesla' creative genius and the frustration he encountered. Sean Patrick is a gifted writer. I read this book very quickly as it held my interest. Keep on writing Sean!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009NF54ZE|5.0|numbe<br /><br />the sequal is as great as the first I love the different puzzles on here and great story line that leaves off where the first one ended.
1601251505|5.0|I've been a long time player of D&D, ever since AD&D came out originally, and I have to say Pathfinder is definitely the best version yet, and it takes everything D&D 3.5/3.0 had, combines it, and rebuilds some of the broken things in it to make it more enjoyable, if you are wondering if Pathfinder is for you, I guarantee you have found the right version to start a new/continuation campaign.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This was a great movie.  It is based on at least two books I have read (Triple Agent, No Easy Day) and it merges informatoin from those books into this movie.  After reading the books, I felt like I knew a lot of what was going to happen.  It was excellent to see it put together.  I was wondering how they would put the analyst's involvement into it.  I felt the hunt for Bin Laden followed very closely to what I read.  Great movie, not too Hollywood as they sometimes are.  The best factual movie I've seen in awhile.  Hopefully, Lone Survivor surpasses this movie as I have read that book twice.<br /><br />Great movie from beginning to end, good for learning about the long hunt!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|At first I was a little iffy on buying this movie, because I wasn't a huge fan of the regular Evangelion anime/movie, but I got it anyways, and I have to say, the animation is was better it's beautiful, the voice acting is spot on for each character, plus you don't get to hear the main character whine/complain the entire time that's a plus!  I would recommend this to anyone to own, especially fans!
0756686970|5.0|My Son loves Lego Star Wars and this was a great buy and great price.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would do business with the seller again! Thank You!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Just as great as Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone, read that review of mine, this one is just as great, can't wait to watch the last one!
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|Awesome song. He really captures a lot of love in it Will be sharing this information with my friends. I think it would make a great gift to a couple.
B00005RDRO|5.0|a CLASSIC!  &#34;Not Finish mushroom story!!!&#34;  This movie is full of one liners and clever plays on words.  If you like CLUE and haven't seen this I would highly suggest it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this puzzle app. It's one of the best free puzzle apps out there. You can constantly add new free pieces with no problems. You can choose the number of  pieces so even little kids can play
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is ausome it feels I'm dealt playing it. you should try it it is ausome I have the very last robot.
B009G41CG2|5.0|hours of entertainment! I enjoy this game very much and this version is pretty close to the original. I like it!
B00FPH6M82|1.0|This shouldn't be a movie. I am disappointed with the storyline of this movie because it just jumped around and kind of went along. What bugged me the most was the most dangerous thing on the planet wasn't even from Earth, so really this story could have taken place anywhere.
B0055SWM08|5.0|hours of entertainment! Simple to understand, it is a game that you can play if you have 5 minutes or 10 hours.  Great!
B009CG9LZI|5.0|Greatest Christmas movie ever!!! Is there anything else to say about it? Best watched with Grinch pajamas and you closest family and friends during the holidays.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|hours of entertainment! Simple to understand, it is a game that you can play if you have 5 minutes or 10 hours.  Great!
B005D63ICI|4.0|Dexter is such an entertaining show.  I probably would have given it a 5 had I not watched Breaking Bad first and now, everything I watch I compare to it.  Dexter has some holes in the story, but it's ok, because it's so entertaining.  Debra is my favorite foul-mouth ever.  LOVE her character.
B0063IH60K|5.0|hours of entertainment! Simple to understand, it is a game that you can play if you have 5 minutes or 10 hours.  Great!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this! It's so much fun plus being a touch frustrating. I wish there were more pix / or a way to erase them to do over
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to install, to access to.  Good way to keep in touch. I am glad it is available. And it is free!! Great!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This  CD is hard to find in the stores, but available with Amazon.  It is an old recording that reminds of precious Christmas feelings.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Excellent accessory replacement ear tips. I like when they enclose both rubber and foam covers for users choice. This is a great buy.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|5 Stars because its very Attractive.  Detail is Amazing and color is on point.  Simply Wow  Those who know Dragon Ball Z will want to steal it and those who don't know Dragon Ball Z will still Find it Amazing.  This is not a toy and there's no movable parts.
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|These guys are amazing. I've yet to be disappointed by them. Sure some CD's are stronger than others but this one is solid.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I can see this getting addicting, but you really have to wade thru a lot of in-game advertising and up selling.  Can't fault the developers though, they gotta get that paper too ;P
B00FAT9W0A|5.0|Good overview of their best stuff, and it leaves off much of their two weakest cd's. Granted some additional songs should have been included but that's a minor quibble considering all the great stuff here.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Really fun. Probably about as good as the console version. Definitely worth it to download it. Wish the characters had more energy or recharged energy faster though. But still really enjoyable.
B00DEFW998|5.0|Greatness runs in the family. Another strong effort from Anoushka. This and Breathing under Water are my favorites. I enjoy her blending of traditional sitar with modern songs. I'm sure there will be those that think it's a musical crime to do that, but I like it.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great action movie! Keeps you on the edge of your chair the entire movie. And don't forget &#34;Taken 2&#34; which is just as good.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Another solid effort by Pearl Jam. If you don't get it on the first listen give it a few spins and it will catch fire.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I would rate this book, but it was never sent to my Kindle although I was charged the $12.00 plus for the item. Could someone, please tell me what happened?
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|The boys do it again. The Mule rocks! This is better than the last two cd's although those were good.
1451648537|5.0|Great book. Love it. Perfect keeper. He had an interesting life. Absolute must buy for the Steve enthusiast. Well written.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|I think this was one of the best horror films I've seen. Everything in the movie is logical. What do I mean? Well, if you knew 8 of your friends had just died by walking out of the house, would you follow them? Probably not. But that's how most horror movies go: You find yourself yelling at the screen &#34;NO! Don't do that!&#34; Well, this movie is different. Everything that happens has a logical explanation. I found myself saying &#34;Well, that sucks, but I probably would've done the same thing... there was no choice.&#34; So that makes the movie that much scarier, because you can see it happening to you! I like it!
B00FAIPDAE|3.0|Not the best, not the worst, it's pretty much average to somewhat above average. Extra long build times as your level increases kind of suck. Personally, I am tired of every game wanting you to pay for every thing that you need to play the game to optimal levels, but that's the price you pay for not having to pay for the game itself.
B00C6PWC4Y|5.0|My daughter loves this Barbie. You really can't go wrong buying a Barbie doll. The quality of the clothes is good as we. This was a great purchase.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Such such a cute clean show! My kids loved it! It was clean which is nice! My kids still quote it all the time.
0316548189|5.0|This was a fantastic and interesting read, and I am not particularly a reader of Autobiographies. It is also a great way to learn GRE vocab words!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love that I am able to have all the state's and cities I love in one place rather then having to look them all up individually.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun and you can't resist playing there's creative mode and survival mode both are fantastic you mine you build you craft it adds up to MINECRAFT!!!
0345525558|4.0|Interesting to learn about the meaning of flowers.  Nice to read of a young girl who was able to turn her life around.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This Is a very good game! I love it so much it reminds me of call of duty and any gun game
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|An excellent horror film with believable characters and an interesting premise and genuine scares. The actors are talented and the atmosphere is chilling. Must watch if you're a fan of internet creepypastas as it follows a similar format and tone.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I read this book because a friend of mine highly recommended it, but I had a bit trouble getting into the story.  This first book of The Mortal Instruments series is my least favorite one.  I was glad I did push myself to finish it and continue to the next book.  CoG and CoFA are my favorite ones so far (the last book is coming out next late May, see if I will change my mind or not)!
B000002IGV|5.0|Besides the two hits, were not gonna take it, and I want to rock, this cd is great from start to finish.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|4.5 stars!  As I commented on the first book, CoB, I had trouble falling into the story at first, but I was glad I did choose to finish it and go on to the second, third, fourth, and the fifth book.  I actually started liking and enjoying this series from its second book, CoA.
0142196940|5.0|Duran Duran has always been my favorite band, and to get to have some real insight into the inner workings of their rise was exciting to me as a fan. I also love getting it from JT's  point of view, along with his more personal family background. It was a pleasure to read. I will be a Duranie till I die, superfan always!
B001NLL93W|5.0|One of my favorite books of The Mortal Instruments series so far (since the last book haven't come out yet!).<br />Another one is CoFA.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|This is one of my 3 month old daughter's favorite toys!!  So many things to look at & plays music every time she touches it!  Plus the mirror is the perfect height for her to look at herself when she is laying on her back!  Recommend!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Got the app for a great price. It is very easy to use and makes being a student one step easier.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game u can fight other people and have fun with the app and have fun with your favorite movie reel steel
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|The only negative thing to say is the kindle has a camera on the front which can be a hassle to work with, but even that isn't really the software's fault.
B0006J28BO|5.0|Oh, how I love this movie and so does my son.  It came in much more quickly than I expected, which was wonderful!  Studio Ghibli never fails me, honestly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My baby bro cries a lot and I put this on and it relaxes him. It is soooo funny and fun. Download it 8)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of fun. I love playing Bingo Blitz. I enjoy trying to collect each new item. I hope you enjoy as much as I do.
B001ANYDAO|1.0|It's boring, it's confusing (it contradicts itself every other chapter), and I regret ever hearing about this book, much less having to read it for school.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Not really much I can add to all the reviews here.  I can say that Firefly has become my all time favorite SF from TV, and that is saying a lot.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is anwsome and my kids even like to play it. its difficult but my daughter helps me get to level 100
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Portion of sales go to Paul Walker's &#34;Reach Out World Wide&#34; Charity Organization, and it's a great value for the steelbook on Amazon so the more reason to buy this awesome movie! Can't wait for Fast 7 to see how they'll work out Paul Walker's story (hopefully with taste).  If you're a fan of the franchise, you can't miss this one. It continues the story, naturally from Fast 5..and as usual, more crazier, pretty much unrealistic, but most importantly, highly entertaining movie just the like the first 5, but bigger, better, and FASTER! And....*SPOILER*, I'm so glad to have my girl Michelle Rodriguez back!  The Rock wasn't bad to have around, either. Good villain, too! Watch it, buy it, help out R.O.W.W.!
B004GJXQ20|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book.  Found it hard to put it down.  Got a little lost with all the detail at times, would be good book to read a second time.
B00E9ZATTY|4.0|All sequels lose a atar - there is original content, but...<br />Picture quality is what you've come to expect form Pixar/Disney.  Audio pretty good too!
B0037RDPEG|2.0|I found this author full of her own importance.  The story did not resonate with me.  It just seemed self indulgent.  Not a book I enjoyed.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|There are already excellent detailed reviews, so I am not going to repeat them.  I just wanted to add my 5-star rating...this is one of the best movies ever.  I rarely buy movies, but I'm pre-ordering the blu-ray for my boyfriend because I believe we will watch this movie over and over.  The character development and cinematography was amazing in this movie.
B000GOUMPI|5.0|Best horror movie of all time.  And my favorite Jack Nicholson movie.  This movie makes you jump out of your seat with just the word TUESDAY.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Talented and always entertaining music.  She is a huge success.  Music makes you feel good and want to dance.  Born this way is very good album
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Deeply textured, nuanced, brooding, dystopian - with hope transcendent<br /><br />Such excellent performances - a well written script - deeply meshed story lines that tantalize and tease with tendrils and tufts of hint and rumor.
0440243688|3.0|Any book that takes place in New York gets extra points, and this one had a definite sense of place. Jack Reacher witnessed a late night incident on the subway, and the story progressed from there. Cops, foreign operatives, good guys, bad guys, violence... just an ordinary few days in Reacher's life.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Fun game that is addictive. You have to buy crowns to upgrade your fault which is always too small to hold what you make. I spent $26 bought a hero all kinds of real estate and made it to level 22 just to have Facebook update and over ride what I had taking me back to level 17 . I lost everything I bought. It constantly tells you are offline and to reconnect to Facebook. Oh yes the ship you use to sell things you have made....well it is always in dry dock being repaired with your items stuck inside. SUPPORT HA what a joke no such thing.  Steer clear of this game and also the web Facebook castleville money hog.
1401228801|5.0|I am a big fan of Fables. I would also give the others this rating, although Some are less than others.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this book. It is historical, fictional, romantic, and deliciously suspenseful. In fact I have only one criticism...his option of Dallas in the modern is tilted the way only a Yankee can. I recommend this book to anyone, and I look forward to rediscovering it someday. Bravo, Mr King.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|It's tough getting to this point in a woman's life...especially alone. One reviewer was upset because there wasn't more about Darcy. This book wasn't about Darcy...the lack thereof is really the plot line.<br />Bridget's grown up...let her deal.  Liked the book quite a bit.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I feel the storyline could have been developed a bit more. I didn't like the two person point of view.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Very Functional and useful.  Still getting used to typing on the kindle fire hd.  I hope they have an app for the mac.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Outstanding story of courage and human strength.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone.  It should be mandatory reading in our high schools.  Our kids could learn a lot from this young man's courage and honor.  A heartbreaking story but a must read.  I went and replaced my old American flag with a brand new after reading this story.  It reinforced my beliefs in our country.  God Bless the USA and God Bless our brave soldiers.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|Good action scenes and Daniel Craig looks the part, but nothing new or exiting here.  I thing the 007 genre needs to take a rest.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|This CD is Awesome !!!! The Best CD Ever , My Favourites are in this CD , I listen to it everyday !
B00FPH6M82|5.0|I saw the previews and really didn't this this show would be that good.....but it was!!! Really enjoyed Will Smith and his son. Both were great!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It held my attention for the entire book.  I look forward to seeing where the story will go from here. I highly recommend this book.  My only wish is that it was a longer read.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|A great television series that sadly you don't see being created very often anymore. The dynamics of the actors and personalities of the characters make each episode worth watching. I never liked Barnies type of character but after watching this even I like his character. I've been addicted to watching this show since it started.
B008MR1PDE|5.0|Never have to convert music files to play on your Kindle!  This works Great and does the job wonderfully!  You must buy the trial version first then get this unlocker.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Upbeat music,captivating and inspirationally amazing, can't wait for the next album! Selena Gomez &#34;Stars Dance&#34; is extremely Captivating and addictive to listen to.
B002SYXCVK|1.0|Sorry I bought this without listening to all the cuts first.  The most bloody awful collection of songs by Sting or anyone else, for that matter. A waste of time and money. When my SIL and daughter first heard this they actually burst out laughing at just how BAD it was. Embarrassing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you thought The Shining was creepy good, Dr. Sleep is even better.  Danny, now Dan, is in the role of Halloran, mentoring a young person, among other things.

0761172726|5.0|This is my all time favorite calendar!  It takes a little while to get used to it because there is a row for each day of the month.  This calendar is the only way that I can keep track of my family of five.  Each family member has their own column, so it is very easy to read across on a certain day and know what is on everybody's schedule.  I recommend this calendar to everyone I can!

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|The book is a disaster alright, but I'm not sure about beautiful. The writing is fine, the dialogue shines, but the characters exhibit the maturity of junior-highers rather than college students. The main characters are his and her drama junkies. Their &#34;normal&#34; is drama. Whenever life goes smoothly for more than five minutes, they create drama, often without adequate motivation. These personalities are bad enough to live with in real life without being saddled with them in fiction.<br />  Though college students sometimes live debauched lifestyles, it was difficult to find any remnant of morality in this pair. Travis is consistently violent throughout the book. Abby is only minimally disturbed by his violence. Their relationship has all the seeds for an abusive marriage. He is hyper-jealous, needy, and controlling. Though McGuire does an excellent job of explaining why Travis and Abby behave as they do, it is still hard to like them. They appear more co-dependent than in love. Travis' only sign of growth throughout the book is that he, for the most part, gives up casual sex. Rather than grow, Abby seems to regress into the person was before college.<br />  To be fair, I did enjoy the breakneck pace of the first two hundred pages, but the next two hundred sixteen pages of break-up/make-up got tedious. 2.6 Stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|satisfied..This product arrived on time and there were no negative issues related to this order. I was satisfied with my order.
B002O3Z50G|1.0|Great movie. Bad seller! I did not get the &#34;keepcase&#34; as told in the description and TITLE! It was a used old case and there were some questionable scratches on the actual DVD. However, it does work fine. I just hate it when people cheat you with false descriptions!! GRRRRR!
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|If you liked the U.S. version of House of Cards, you'll love this one from England.  Dark drama as only the Brits can do it: smart, sophisticated, compelling, and rippling with irony and treachery.  Ian Richardson is masterful as the very bright and equally unprincipled member of Parliament who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|I bought this DVD as used but was not expecting to have such a hard time getting it to play with out skipping.
0062305948|5.0|This is such a cute story!!  I love reading it and my 4,5 year old can't get enough of it.  The stickers and gift tags are a great bonus.  We have the moose book too so he can identify the stickers.  This book is very funny, stickers add extra level of fun, I would highly recommend it.
B007XHWROK|4.0|The CD arrived in a very timley manner, it was super smooth, and my daughter is very pleased with CD as well. :)
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Loved this movie. Great plot and cast, especially Jude Law. I will watch it again to see if I missed clues about what was really happening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|try it out it is an awesome app I recommend you try it out it feels like I have a actual horses
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is great to spend time on.  Very addictive.  Able to progress okay without having to spend too much hard earned cash.
B007LGLKUU|5.0|Would like to see season 2-10 on here so I could watch them too!! When will this happen?? Can Amazon let us know if it will happen??
B00F14IM5K|5.0|He's SUPER CUTE! And his hair is gelled up and wasn't messed up in the back like some MH dolls! I was so excited to get him and he sure delivered!!! He's awesome! My ghoulia doll is very happy! His shoes are adorable! The fact that they gave him brand new shoes i love! Thanks mattel! And thanks amazon for delivering him quick!!!!********** for those of you who are curious about his hands yes he does have the clawd hands with claws! LET ME ADD I DID NOT PAY ALOT FOR HIM!! I ORDERED HIM IN NOVEMBER OF 2013 and he was $12.99 direct through amazon! With free shipping thanks to prime:)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Two very enthusiastic thumbs up. I'm going to see the movie tomorrow. I can't wait to read the next book now. I loved the ending. I had a feeling that while the games were underway that there would be a rebellion going on. The book ended perfectly I might add. On to the next book.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Very entertaining and heartfelt Superman film - great acting by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner (should have had more scenes).<br /><br />I really enjoyed 'MAN OF STEEL' much more than I thought I would. The action was cool, the effects epic and most importantly you cared for the characters. The best scenes involved Ma and Pa Kent played with heartfelt gravitas by DIANE LANE (Best Actress Oscar nominee for Unfaithful, Perfect Storm) and KEVIN COSTNER (Oscar winner for Dances With Wolves). All the actors are good but those two shone for me and should have had more scenes. In fact it was the supporting actors who are the more well known stars... COSTNER, DIANE LANE, RUSSELL CROWE, LAURENCE FISHBURNE... yet it is HENRY CAVILL (who I am not familiar with) who holds the film together with a superb portrayel of Superman / Clark Kent. A good movie with good characters and it is very entertaining.
1936608898|5.0|This book will change the life of anyone suffering bloating and unreasonable obesity or weight gain problems. I lost 9 pounds and 4 inches during the 30 day challenge. Mostly water holding onto those ancient stored excess carbs. The book is funny and written in an understandable language. This book should be required reading in school, seriously!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun! I love the minions and quite frankly any other game they can come up with. I cant make it without messing up on the first stage but it keeps me entertained as well as my kiddos when we have down time.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|If it weren't for the hint button, it would have taken way longer. The story line has you wondering if your deductions are right.I haven't quite finished it. But I will buy the second installment.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is so outrageously good, I can't even wait to finish it to post a positive review. It mixes honest depictions of hard, real-life situations and the impact they have on kids, with a love story so beautiful and unique that, if I'd read it 25 years ago, it would've exploded my whole universe. It's definitely not appropriate for readers any younger than 11, but it contains nothing that isn't already in our schools and homes, and I highly recommend that a parent read this before or concurrently with their child/teen so they're equipped for potential discussions of difficult subjects. You'll both benefit from the experience and beauty of the story.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I got a AGPtek audio usb cassette capture and I can not use it on windows 7.....  can't send it back because I opened it and am stuck with it...  DAH  I forgot to see what operating system it was made for.........
0553582011|5.0|Item arrived early and in perfect condition. On a side note it arrived cold as Ice but I guess that's fitting for this particular book ;-)<br />I will be ordering more items from this carrier, if items I am searching for are available through them.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I just think it could have been much better. This story has a lot of loveable characters, and the Tris/Tobias romance was great in book one. Maybe it shouldn't have been a trilogy. I can't recommend this book.
0345529057|5.0|Books were packed and shipped very professionally. All in excellent condition as the listing described. I am very excited to read more into the characters I have learned to love in the HBO series.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Deleted it after 2 days of play.  Didn't know you had to pay money to keep playing when it ran out of time.  This was a really annoying game and not that much fun anyway!
B006OE7XM4|4.0|I love Gregory Porter's voice.  He's become my favorite male vocalist.  I'm not crazy about the music itself.  I guess it's like scotch.  Because the music, for the most part, is unknown to me, listening to it more and more--well, i will get used to it but only because of his voice.  He's masterful.  I would love to hear him do standards.  He does a standard, it seems, one per album,  like 'Skylark' on another album.  Again, he does it so differently, it took me awhile to get used to it.  What helps me hang in there is his amazing voice.  I will go crazy with love if he does a standards album.  I feel, though, that he won't because he's totally devoted to jazz with his voice.  Nonetheless, he's my favorite voice that doesn't sing the songs I love but who takes me for a wonderful vocal ride with what he loves.
1416550550|3.0|I love this type of mystery, going back in time, and this one has a good plot, but sheesh!  I used pencil and paper to keep track of the family tree, circa, timeline and all the miscellaneous characters . There are questions that were left unanswered for me.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book should be required reading, it is a heartfelt story as well as an enlightening one.  We all owe Henrietta Lacks for her contribution to society and cell research.  Rebecca Skloot told this story with compassion for the family, but at the same time explained the science of how cell research began and has progressed through the years.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I have been a big fan of Soundgarden for 30 years, this album should be a no brainer for anyone with a pulse.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not an avid reader of fiction but loved the Hunger Games books, read all 3 of them and I am excited about the movie Catching Fire that has just come to the theaters, can't wait to see it.  Could not put these books down and enjoyed the first Hunger Games movie as well.  Gave the first book a try out of curiosity but was quickly involved in the characters and could not wait to read the next one.
B000001EUP|5.0|I don't want to have to review this because it was something my wife purchased for someone else and I've never seen it...but Amazon is making me do it.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|This book was delightful.  I really enjoyed it and it was a fast read.  The author did a great job.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a fun game, but it can be slightly frustrating because it doesn't provide any guidance. I look forward to the new levels.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I won’t give an overview of the plot as there are many reviews that have done a much better job that I could do.  I will though give a brief review of why this book is a disappointment.<br /><br />The premise of time travel is great and the backstory of the assassination of JFK made me certain this would be one of Kings better books. I was wrong.<br /><br />The first half of the book is page turning and it quickly dies off from there. Great plot scenarios end up disappointing and there are so many clichés I found myself skipping forward to confirm my suspicions.<br /><br />I imagined King writing this novel, having fun but trying to find that magic that he has brought millions of readers over the years. He failed miserably. He alludes to it (I won’t give any spoilers) and he also desperately wants it. But in this book it does not happen.<br /><br />I would suggest Mr. King to buy a Schwinn and take a ride and then perhaps he may find that magic once again.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My daughter is reading the books and we have an arrangement to watch the movies only after she has read each book.  She has really enjoyed the first three books and loved the first movie.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|LOTS of very engaging mini games and a cute story line but it did go quickly; even for the full version.
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|Only down side is they announced ANOTHER x men movie. So there will be no room to put it. :(<br /><br />Other than that its amazing
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for Christmas for my boyfriend. He LOVED it! It is very difficult, and so much fun! Very cool!!
B000002GFC|1.0|I ordered three new cds including this one. The cream cd I recieved was used, damaged and won't play. It even had a substance on the cover resembling cat urine. Real nice. Purchased it on Nov 7, today is Dec 5 but amazon says it can't be returned. Caveat emptor.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Kline lets you really get to know the characters.  I know someone whose mother was on the real &#34;OrphanTrain&#34; which really made the story come alive.  You ache for these children.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The singing, staging and performances are stunning, especially Alfie Boe in the title role, but really all the performers. By far my favorite version. High, high, high recommendation!
1608871827|5.0|Excellent book for Pacific Rim fans :) also great for those interested in movies' production, art concepts, cast and director choices.
B004CLYKLI|2.0|Our book club read this and &#34;Glass Castles&#34; side by side.  Our group decided we would rather be the kids in Glass Castles than these two young ladies.  Hard to believe, but true.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Brilliant Film, to be watched again and again.  The cast pitch perfect.  Kevin Spacey in excellent form.  Chris Cooper as always amazing.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Avid reader this read was a great surprise and I cant wait to finish the next volume. JS Memphis Tn
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing! I really like it! If you have seen Despicable Me 1and 2,then you will think this game is so cute!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|AWESOME game definitely recommend it to all ages and play it all th  time for hours on end I actually am sort of addicted<br /><br />Viugiygjhfggggggghhhh
B007TK77QE|4.0|The harsh reality of teenager life in a complex world of selfish adults. The plot uncovers the boredom of life in an English village where there is a reluctance to accept social issues, instead opting for a false set of values that disintegrate when the only real person dies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun.  Glad it's finally on my kindle fire. I don't like the fact where you get stuck and have to pay for extra items just to get past a level.
B00GT67UUM|5.0|What a great game.  It had me hooked from the very first puzzle.  The graphics are great, the music soothing,  a challenge mode, and if you don't care about how many points you make, you can go at a pace you like.  Well worth the money.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It's so cool u can look up song and play than on a piano yup so cool. I have now learn ed how to play great piano it's awesome
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham at his best. I re-read A Time To Kill, per a suggestion in another review. Good advice. Not necessary, but I liked having that background and did not remember several details.
B008VO3PA4|1.0|Stupid. Worst book ever. Don't waste your money. I never rate books and I have to say this book was stupid.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Great 5 star TV Series. Also don't forget your Prime Membership so you can catch up on shows you've missed. Or great spin-off series from The Vampire Diaries, like The Originals
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Dis game is cool 2 play i will always play dis game I get a lot of coins on here
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I play this cd so much Im surprised it does not combust. A classic album surprised I never got it sooner
B00EJOCAYW|2.0|Shame on Lego for making these legos so little!!  And still charges  the high prices of others!  My grandson will be so excited when he sees the box, but so disappointed when he sees how little they are.  Looks like Lego only interested in making big bucks off Minecraft craze. What really could have been a great gift turned out to be a major disappointment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the challenge.  It's fun and frustrating at the same time especially when you<br />are stuck on a level (125) for over a month.<br />Stuck
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|A friend sent me a link several years ago to Allie's blog about her retarded dog. I tried to read it out loud to my boyfriend, but I laughed too hard for him to make any sense of what I was reading. I've followed her avidly since then, and I am in awe of her willingness to reveal stuff the rest of us hide deep deep down, so deep we don't even tell our therapists. She is amazing, funny, and I loved her book and drawings. And I'm really glad I don't have her dogs.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Absolutely thrilling read! The concepts were a little more abstract this time but all came to together, held with healthy doses of action and humanity... I've read most of the sigma force novels but this one is my new favorite
0670024856|1.0|I can't believe the rave reviews this book is getting.  I'm half way through and am giving up.  Although it did get off to a good start, the story lost its way after Alma's marriage ended and she took off for Tahiti.  The plot was contrived and banal, the characters unbelievable and I just didn't get a good sense of time and place. Three strikes.  There was so much potential here and I was very disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really great game for all ages. The only thing I would do differently is make it to where you can choose your first horse. That's just me though. :)
B00000612P|5.0|Rod's finest outing ever.I have not quit listening to this album, virtually on a daily basis, since its release a lifetime ago.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is fun and addicting. No problems here. Just like on Facebook. And it links to your Facebook account too.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I use to play this game online and I love that I found it for free for Kindle.  It is not a complicated game however it is fun to sit down and play.  It is a game you start to play and don't realize how much time you have wasted playing.  I think this games is good for all ages.
B003YUSLYA|3.0|I bought two pairs of the shoes and both are M5/W7. One pair is in navy color which is made in China and fits well. The other is in grey color made in Mexico and runs small. Different origin, different size. This make it hard to choose the right size for costumers. Although the shoes are quite light, they are not so comfortable, maybe due to the poor design.
B002RNOS2Y|1.0|Shipping was excellent.  The issue is this dvd can't be played here in the USA.  ABSOLUTELY ridiculous why it would be sold......very annoying.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This addictive little game is awesome for kids, I must admit that I have enjoyed playing with the game, too.  A very little strategy is involved, but primarily, the game is great for those times when you have about five or so minutes to spare. Then come back later to reap your rewards.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I was initially attracted by James' offer to reimburse readers who proved to him the actually *read* his book. In the end, I decided to let him keep the dough, as it contained some very useful tidbits.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Not much into racing but I like this game<br />Graphics are amazing, and the characters are silky like a stillborn monkey
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Slow at times and unnecessarily confusing but a decent end to the three books.  I am not sure if unwound recommend such a dark concept to any young reader I know.
B008VO3PA4|2.0|I bought this book because they said it was funny, I did not find it funny at all.  It was a bad purchase that I made.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Solid glass mug, very impressive!  I bought this for a gift exchange & it was a success!  We drank eggnog and toasted cousin Eddie!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This DC adapter was a purchase with my Anker 2nd Gen Astro3, it does what it is intended to do nicely.  It charges my Anker external battery fine, and is great with the two ports to also plug my iPhone in or charge both my phone and my wife's at the same time.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|This is the best ghost story ever written.  Absolute horror.  The movie is even better than the novel, as great as that is.  I also recommend Hill's *The Man in the Picture*.
1567184855|2.0|Did not like this book at all.  Did not find it at all interesting.  It would have been a bit more interesting if the author did not keep adding his personal opinions about the people he had put under hypnosis.
B000B589JI|5.0|This little container is great & goes perfect with the little True Waterproof Lighter. I keep them together.<br />The container holds quite a bit of lighter fluid. So far non as evaporated out of the container & I've had it since May 2013. I only keep it half full.<br />Be careful & don't over tighten the O-rings on the caps. The outer cap u can tighten down as tight as u want, I only hand tighten mine.<br />When u get this make sure all threads r not crossed on the caps. It will leak. My 1st one was. But I returned it & Amazon sent me another one & it was right.<br />I keep this & the waterproof lighter in a survival kit & keep it in my truck. Can't go wrong with the pair if ur in a survival situation. I do check them from time to time. To make sure they r not leaking or have lost any fluids. Hope this was helpful.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Well written, inspiring book. Good for students. Crisp, clear and conscious. Well structured book, brings out specific aspects that one tends to ignore.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A good balance of drama, action, comedy, faith and family.  Appropriate for teens and adults.  Many moral/spiritual lessons presented in the film.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|This was a pretty good deal for the price, plus their arms move.  My son will love these figures for Christmas
B00DG292SK|4.0|If for no other reason, it's good to finally see Townshend' s explanation of his criminal case.  He's right; he should have fought it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hours and hours of mindless match three.  Love the power ups. Make sure you save them for when you really need them
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|You are on a strange journey. There are pitfalls, deep caverns you fall into, portals that transport you to get ahead.<br />It takes time to get used to it.<br />I prefer tilt control, so my tablet is more often than not upside down and I look like I practice a weird yoga position.<br />I don't know what galaxy the developers discovered it in, but  definitely not ours. Maybe Andromeda.<br />Five stars for thinking out of the box and using imagination to create an awesome game. One of the best FAOTDs.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is great. Good for all ages<br />Very easy to learn how to play. I love it. One of my fav
B00GSZEBE2|5.0|It slightly reminds me of the old PC game Sim Tower.<br />You have to manage business and growth on the Death Star by adding levels and assigning jobs to \\"Bitizens\\".<br />There also are occasional minigames like finding a spy, and you collect species as well as scenes in the album.<br />It's a nice touch that you can change the look of your Bitizens, I use this feature to make them look what I think someone with their job should look like, it makes it easier to keep track. I also find it convenient to sort the levels by function.<br />It starts small, with a good tutorial, but gets more complex.<br />Efficiency is important.<br />So that you aren't idle waiting for a completion, you have to play elevator boy and get your people manually where they need to go.<br />You'll also be notified if something comes up.<br />The Emperor doesn't like you to procrastinate.<br /><br />A few tips:<br />- don't forget to build residential levels so you can fill all job openings<br />- don't be impatient and waste your money on immediate completion<br />- always give your Bitizens the jobs they are best at, dream job is optimal<br />- the businesses sell while you are away (device on standby)<br />- saved VIPs can be found on the arrival level.<br /><br />You have weeks of fun, but some creature comforts like better elevators and special items can only be bought with a lot of bux, and I think buying them is too expensive, I mean, 2,000 bux for $100?<br /><br />Otherwise, live long and prosper. Wait, wrong universe ;)
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|One of 2 my favorite movies. One of movies' classics masterpieces! I can still remember watching this movie almost 20 years ago, when it appeared on a big screens. Since then I watched Braveheart more than 10 times and every time watching I still get the same feeling as it was the first time. What made me such a huge impression? The simple answer would be - everything. The movie is really done brilliantly. Having in mind that it is almost 20 years old and it's impossible to compare it to today movies, but still this movie can compete with majority of the movies being made today. My second favorite movie is Avatar and I can say that Braveheart is the Avatar in those days.<br /><br />The story line is quite simple, but the implementation of it is astonishing. Mel Gibson did a great job combining all the components together to make Braveheart. The movie has everything: romance, freedom, fight, betrayal, love, will, persistence, idea, legacy and many more elements of life. It's impossible to describe this movie in any review. The only way to understand it is to watch it yourself. I believe, that there won't be anybody left with no feeling after this movie!
030758836X|1.0|english lit major figures out a way to make money by taking &#34;scott thurows&#34; lame idea in &#34;presumed innocent&#34; and blows it up ten fold. read &#34;simenon&#34;, if you have, read again.  much better than this muck
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Lots of fun, really like this game! Runs fast and smooth on my kindle HDX.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I thought it was not beautifully written it was pretty good and I want to read the second one that is called Speaker For The Dead
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Haunting writing, amazingly crafted characters that will stay with you in your heart. Really looking forward to the movie now.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved the book. Excellent personal account of an interesting man. It goes to show that high achievers are not always so, in every sphere of their life. A brilliant man but fallible human like all of us. A small adventure into the world of the &#34;spectrum crowd&#34;...
0525953728|3.0|I simply do not believe these narratives. There's NO EASY WAY to TELL THE TRUTH! I don't believe this book's spin, and there IS a spin, in my humble opinion.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Like others, I had great expectations.  But don't waste your money (even though it is very reasonably priced).<br /><br />The unit freezes constantly, even &#34;casting&#34; simple text-based web pages.  Seems to work fine when I go to a new site, but then freezes when I scroll down.  How frustrating is that?!<br /><br />It's going back tomorrow.
B000M341QO|5.0|Great movie, Good pace to the action and a fine story line. Unedited so you get it just like in the theaters!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This get  a five star because lots of action and emotion I cried I descend you read the first and second book first then this one an  this book for me should be for people who like lot  of action and sitting on the environment  of your seat and never putting  you  book down with a little romance
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Great movie, Good pace to the action and a fine story line. Unedited so you get it just like in the theaters! Love the sound track.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The women in this book are hurt and very very angry. I get why they're hurt, but their anger is so intense. I started feeling hostile toward my own hubby, and even my daughter's boyfriend.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|the game is a welcome in the gaming community.  It's a fun and wholesome game for the whole family.  Will recommend to anyone who wants to go crazy trying to get to the next level.  thanks KING.com
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Good story line, good acting, excellent special effects, just generally engrossing...don't feel any need to add more words...tired of you prompting me to add more words...just forget it.
B00FHAB3HW|1.0|The child needs a good old fashioned butt whipping. She has never been taught how to grow up. Shameful waste of a good person. I'm sure her father is beside himself. All of us in this society created this and all the others like her. We are to blame because we give this behaviour any attention and her handlers know people will pay for the scandal. Do not purchase her albums and send the message to her handlers we do not want this trash getting to our children and corrupting innocence.
1451629192|4.0|Hard to believe someone could be so grounded and forgiving as this incredible lady. She comes across as a truly good person, from her love of all animals to her incredible reaction to such a horrific happening. God bless her and her family (including the pets of course).<br /><br />The book is really well written and has just enough denial to not be disturbing but offer an insight into this Stockholm Syndrome type event.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a very simple calculator and works perfectly for my needs.  There is no learning curve with this calculator
B000E9910W|4.0|A clasic band for those of us that like a fun band that knows how to play some rocking tunes. We all to sing along to These guys. They paved the way of a great band many songs a songs by memory that brings some back some good times. I would recomend the band for part of a collection worth the $ for all the tunes on this disk. Is also a text cd so the title of the band shows up once played if you have a text cd player
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Quite a page turner. I did not see the end coming. I love how the author uses history in a compelling way. The book demonstrates a deep understanding of the south, and i enjoyed learning the legal aspects behind challenging wills in court.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|These guys do Rock and Most of their tunes Are True Clasics and Memories. There are some of their tunes that need some true love of the era like many timeless bands.<br /> However If you like Kansas this is worthy of adding to your collection. I try to buy Now' the Best of' collections rather than the whole Box set. If I'm not a true die hard fan of  the band. However these guys Overall are Worthy of some of the Clasic spotlight. If new to the band and like Many of their tune a true fan - go for it. The true clasics outshine their needing more studio time on a few others;)
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game just too much up grading then you have to wait for it to upgrade. Guns cost to much. It's hard to get gold coins I think u should get gold coins for every kill.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A hugely moving story, that takes you into the lives of the characters, and doesn't let you go. Would recommend wholeheartedly.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Excellent read. Clear and concise presentation. It's all about the carbs.<br />A sure way to strengthen your body and health.
B00633W614|4.0|Loved the book, a good read.  Must go back and read Only Time Will Tell, and Best Kept Secret.  After Sins of the Father, you know you will pre order the next book.  Waiting for the release.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this up on a recommendation from Cory Doctorow's site, and man...they were right. The beginning felt a bit slow, but I hadn't caught the rhythm yet, the pace and how it quickened. I immediately picked up the Shift Omnibus after I finished Wool, about ten minutes ago. Great piece of work by Howey, and I look forward to reading the rest of his stuff.
0316548189|5.0|The story of a great icon told in a  very natural voice, spelling out  his simple life  growing up, the  values that gave him the formidable foundation upon which he built his legacy  of  taking a nation from the brink of disaster to  the road of hope and a future where humanity is the number one value. Mandela symbolised the soul of Africa, the tenacity of its people and  the forgiving nature of their hearts. Only in the case of Josef Njike in the book Disciples of Fortune  have I read of an African hero portrayed in  such a human light. We come out from reading this book not only  more enlightened, but also reinvigorated and  even more joyful. &#34;Kuaga, Mandela&#34;, Africa's greatest hero and enlightener, unblemished by power to the point of giving it up after having it for only four years.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|The usual hollywood crap. The bots are cool just not enough cool. Lot's of human talking always ruins a good sci fi.

B0002KQNJU|5.0|Quite an entertaining film this one. I really  enjoyed this movie.  Roman  Polanski has created an intriguing movie to watch.

B004ELSDZK|4.0|Very unique and challenging game. You must study the game board carefully and chose your moves with care, because there is only once correct solution. The object of the game is to link &#34;spirits&#34; in groups of two/three (depending on the level). The spirits must all be on the same row or column but they don't have to be touching. This game should be free for everyone!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Great Idea but it is currently limited on the IOS mobile platform. The price is right though, and its pretty cool for what it does, but my TV, Xbox, and BR Player already does the same things. As more apps become available I can see this as a pretty cool item, but for now, on the iPhone and iPad, you get Netflix, YouTube, and a few other movie and music services. We need to be ably to cast anything from our mobile device to the big screen. Then it will be 5 stars.

B00BPDR3F6|3.0|It seemed like an impossible task to weave plant discoveries and the medical uses of plants into an interesting  Story, but it was well done! My only critism is that the book really did need editing. IT was far too long and there was too much padding,especially in the second half.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in some time. And to do it as father and son is cool. Will Smith must be so proud of his son. He did such I good job at his age. He acted like he had been doing it for years. You must get this movie. It not one you can just watch once.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. I was so sad that I had to leave this world when it ended. Beautiful and heartbreaking.
B005COO1X6|1.0|THIS WAS TERRIBLE! IT WASN'T THE AWESOME WRITING THAT ONE EXPECTS FROM STEPHEN KING. IT WASN'T SCARY AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. IT WAS KINDA LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO BRING BACK CHRISTINE OR A CAR LIKE HER, ONLY CHRISTINE WAS SCARY AND INTERESTING. THE KILLER CAR IN THIS WAS LAME.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wanted to love this book so much. I was enthralled with the characters from the beginning. Two wonderful books only to be let down entirely and wish that I hadn't wasted my time. I kept trying to get in to Allegiant. Saying, ok maybe I'm not paying attention enough so that's why I keep losing track of who's POV it is or what all this genetic manipulation stuff is. But no. This thing reads like electronic instructions, so much useless information just chapters and chapters of it. Blah blah blah.<br />I get that main characters get killed off all the time. It's happened in so many YA books, I understand it and applaud it when it enhances the story. This was just pointless! UGH If you loved the first two books, DO NOT READ THIS ONE. I promise you it will ruin the series. Pretend that insurgent was the final book. Like a favorite series on TV that gets canceled after only one season. Just leave it be....
068987474X|5.0|I WAS GOING THROUGH A VERY HARD BREAK-UP WHEN I BOUGHT THIS BOOK. IT IS REALLY A GREAT BOOK TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE DUMPS. IT IS FUNNY AND SAD AND BRUTALLY HONEST. IT IS WRITTEN BY A MAN SO I'M PRETTY SURE HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. IT ISN'T A STORY LIKE THE MOVIE SO DON'T COMPARE THE TWO.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put this book down.<br />SO GOOD.  I had not read any of this author's work before this book, but will seek out her other novels now.
B002KJX4IE|3.0|I loved this movie as a child, and it is still fun. However, with age, I now find the character Beetlejuice to be a bit more obnoxious and offensive than the hilarious caricature he was when I was younger. I still enjoyed it though.
B0089LOG02|5.0|It's based on true experiences.  It was very interesting to read.  The idea of sending orphans to the Midwest was intended to be a good thing, but it was a terrible experience for a lot of the children.  I would recommend the book.
0399226907|5.0|This has always been a favorite of mine and now my 18 month old daughter.  She's really hard on her board books but this is great quality and still looks great after lots of abuse :)

B00GD9F59S|5.0|Ahh, how to express my feelings at the end of such a roller coaster of a series... I am a huge fan of Jennifer Armentrout's work, I have read pretty much everything that she has written and nothing has ever disappointed me. This book definitely followed suit.<br /><br />I love these books (like her Lux Series) because they're just a &#34;little bit&#34; Young Adult and a little bit New Adult...  Then characters venture from the 17-20 year range so they are dealing with growing up and leaving their childhoods behind and starting to discover what it means to love someone.  The storyline is full of twists, drama, and heart pounding action one minute and hot steamy romance the next. The Romance is &#34;closed door&#34; (no descriptive sex) but it is definitely implied, which worked really well for a book of this style.<br /><br />I thought the end of this series was amazingly good.  I have to admit there were some twists in there that I didn't seem coming and I always love that about this author, I can never predict what she's going to do next.  With some books I hate when they are done because I want more or it feels like there's loose ends that didn't get tied up.  With this book I felt like I couldn't have asked for a more perfect conclusion to an amazing series.  I highly recommend it for a slightly older YA audience.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|The game is fun and the hidden objects are pretty good. The puzzles, though, are relatively simple. I play on the kindle fire HD and have had no issues. Does pan and zoom, but am taking one star because when you touch the screen in zoom mode to pan, it counts as a wrong click. I would also prefer a lot less dialogue and more hidden objects (you can skip dialogue by going into the menu). Overall, a four star game, but because of touch issue three stars given.
0743270754|3.0|I am a Lincoln buff, but this book had too much detail. if that is possible. I don't really want to know all that much about Illinois politics, county convention leaders, etc. The parts about Mary Lincoln and their son were riveting, however.

0452295548|5.0|As an aging adult, I have kept this book as a reference. It was scary and, in the end, most helpful. I hope that my relatives read it if I am ever rendered incapable of communication. I admire the author very much. The chapter for care-givers should be required reading for nursing students.
B008578JI0|1.0|Acting was stiff, lines were delivered poorly and as if reading them from the script for the first time.  Special effects were of a lower quality.  Very disappointing, considering the quality talent in this movie.
B00BAXFJ5M|2.0|Simple, roughly crafted story with poor attention to detail. A boy is seen with a Luger - his father's collectible antique pistol - which is thereafter referred to as a Mauser. I mean, did anyone edit this book?  Not worthy of Baldacci, who I generally like, but this reads like a weekend effort.  The sexually frustrated dynamic duo are just too cute for anything other than a superficial page turner.
0143123580|5.0|Fantastic book and a great service. Book was sent overseas very efficiently. The message in the book is invaluable! Exactly as I was told in reviews.

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Great casting, although Fassbender is a little too good looking for the book's description. I liked the treatment of the Mason character, too. The chemistry between Jane and Rochester was real and very well acted. However, the ending was a great disappointment. To end it with such a brief reunion was a cheat. The ending may work for those who haven't read the book or seen other adaptations, but for the many Jane fans around the world, this one has left us feeling cheated.
B00FCAJZTK|3.0|This made me smile and laugh, but not for the best reasons that one might have for doing those things. It's definitely in the same vein as Spirits, which I like better, but it's the &#34;plugged in&#34; version. Not plugged in to a &#34;higher source&#34; of inspiring music, but plugged in to some cheap sounding equipment with little attempt or intention to make it sound much better. I recently described this in an email to a friend as being a combination of sounding like what a group of not so great 15 year old musicians might produce in their basement circa the early 1970's. There's the guitar noodling that reminds me of a heavily sedated Jerry Garcia, the overdriven and cheap bass sound that smacks of a padded Kustom amp that's about to blow, and nothing that really struck me as more than some &#34;noodling&#34; on fairly simple ideas.<br />Having read Keith's quote about the profundity of these recordings and the tightness of the rhythm section (himself on bass and percussion), I'm profoundly happy that he's not &#34;quit his day job&#34; as a pianist, composer, and interpreter of standards and classics to focus on more of this kind of stuff. As for the other review that alluded to the &#34;live-ness&#34; of this, if Keith played everything, it certainly isn't &#34;live&#34; in the sense that it's not all produced in the moment, but is the product of &#34;playing with yourself&#34;- not in that way, but perhaps close, if you get my meaning.<br />I'm glad to have heard this. It's definitely a novelty project to my ears, and I doubt that many will cite this as part of a great artist's important legacy. Maybe it's going to grow on me in time, but at the moment, it's little better than okay. I'm waiting for the upcoming solo piano stuff from Bregenz and Munich.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a pretty fascinating story. Especially because the author is a highly trained neurosurgeon. It is another example, if more were needed of the incredible mystery of consciousness and the relationship between brain & mind.

B008QE9XD2|2.0|The original DARK SHADOWS was a soap opera that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971.  The series did not draw a significant audience and was on the verge of cancellation when creator and producer Dan Curtis began adding supernatural storylines.  Suddenly the ratings took off, and the series remained popular until changing tastes, a lack of fresh material, and unusually high production costs brought it to a sudden end.<br /><br />Over the years there have been two films with the original cast, HOUSE OF DARK SHADOWS and NIGHT OF DARK SHADOWS, and two attempts at a series revival.  In 2012 20th Century Fox released a star-studded feature film titled DARK SHADOWS, developed and directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Helena Boham Carter.  The film received mixed reviews, and although it did reasonably well in America and even better in Europe, it was regarded as a box office disappointment.<br /><br />The film begins with a five minute recap of the basic soap opera storyline, radically condensed and significantly tweaked.  Barnabas Collins (Depp) narrates his life from his boyhood in England to coming of age in America, the son of a prosperous family.  Although he has an physical affair with servant girl Angelique (Eva Green), it is really Josette (Bella Heathcote) he loves--and Angelique, secretly a powerful witch, responds by killing his parents, driving Josette to suicide, and turning Barnabas into a vampire.<br /><br />All of this is preface: the film actually begins when Barnabas is accidentally freed from the coffin in which Angelique has trapped for close to two hundred years.  He experiences considerable culture shock, but he nonetheless finds his way to the family home, Collinwood, where he enters into a pact with family matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer) to revive the family fortunes.  His relationship with the family is complicated by governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote again), who bears a remarkable resemblance to Josette.  But Angelique is still lurking about, determined to gain Barnabas' love, even if she has to destroy the entire family to do it.<br /><br />The movie is very stylish in terms of designs and visuals, but although the script starts out well and finishes well, it has a great big huge sagging middle.  There are occasionally effective moments of parody and a few interesting special effects, but that's pretty much it.  Depp is merely adequate.  Pfeiffer is wasted.  Helena Bonham Carter is miscast.  The plot is fairly uninteresting and the script uninspired.<br /><br />When the film debuted a good many critics commented that while Burton and Depp have done several good films together, their artistic collaboration seems to have run its course, and they would be better off going in different directions.  Much the same could be said of Burton and Helena Bohnam Carter; Burton seems determined to cast his girlfriend in one film after another, but he never seems to find her an appropriate part, and she is particular dire as Dr. Hoffman.<br /><br />DARK SHADOWS isn't as bad as its detractors claim.  Unfortunately, it isn't as good as its supporters would have you believe.  In the end, it is trivial.  Recommended to hardcore fans of Burton and his stars, but that's all.<br /><br />Gary Taylor<br />Amazon Reviewerto Josette.

B0063IH60K|1.0|The game has good play value. I had it for a long time. But the advertising has become intolerable! They are often LOUD and obnoxious. The ads are designed so that you have to hunt and search how to stop for each one. ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU LOVE ADVERTISING
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I spend a LOT of minutes that magically morph into hours on this app. I have tried other park-building apps, but the developers of Dragonvale constantly work to keep the game fresh.<br />Poo
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best app ever. I got it yesterday, and it is so awesome that I got from the Pacific northwest to North Africa in an hour. EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE.<br />There are also amazing challenges, like hunting a pure white stag with the danger of a black bear hunting you. EXTREMELY INTERESTING.<br />Then, there is the art. The graphics are so awesome, it feels like I`m actually there. EXTREMELY REALISTIC.<br /><br />Other than the occasional tiny glitch, this app is ...AWESOME!!!!!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It's not as good as the console version but it is still one of the best mobile games I've played.
0375423966|5.0|If you enjoy graphic novels about historical topics, or you have just dabbled a bit, say with Maus, you should read Persepolis. A good friend recommended these books (I & II) and I am forever in his debt. Before reading these books, I had no idea what life was like in Iran during the revolution. In this, her autobiography, Ms. Satrapi shares those tumultuous times through the eyes of an intelligent, artistic teen. And, as with many teens, she was rebellious – a dangerous trait in a country of radical and ever-tightening religious restrictions. This is a great read at many levels. Buy it.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Very funny. Great evening movie. The cast and story kept me laughing through the entire movie. I would recommend to others.
0743201140|5.0|Yes, you read the title correctly, I have purchased dozens of copies of this book. Why? Because every time I cross paths with someone, often a mid-to-late teen, who is not sure who she is, or what makes her happy, I give her a copy. It's not just for teens. I didn't read it and take the test until I was in my late 40's, but it should be required reading and part of a career planning course in ALL high schools. 'nough said! The concept is simple. By the time you are entering primary grades in school, you are fairly hard wired to excel and enjoy specific interests and abilities, only at that age, you probably don't recognize them. And those around you don't help. Teachers, peers and parents can knowingly or unknowingly guide you away from the very capabilities that will make you productive and happy for the rest of your life. Buy the book. Read the intro chapters. Take the test. Read the other chapters that apply to your results. Start living the life you were destined to live. It's never \\"too late.\\" Find the mountain on the horizon that was meant to be your destination and start making choices based on whether they will help you reach your mountain.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great game! The first and also one of the best. Since its beginnings, the game has had new levels added to it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Intriguing knowledge of the federal prison system and DA mind sets. More intricate than real.  Plastic surgery for witness protection is interesting.
B004SBX112|5.0|Great Game! Very much like the original but goes a step further with some of the levels. I think I preferred this to the original.
B000059T00|5.0|This disc is all time classic for a reason. The lineup. Winwood. Clapton. Baker. Grech. For me the real star of this show is 21 year old Steve Winwood. The rock world never heard a voice like that and never will again. Steve is one in a million. He still sings perfect at age 65. A good companion to this CD would be Steve Winwood Eric Clapton Live at MSG 2008

B00GGEVKYO|5.0|Peter Jackson is a genius,his attention to detail is second to none.I was initialy disappointed with the ending but realized he couldn't do the Dragon to his satisfaction so he had to come up with a different end to the story. which was done well. The story he did give us was fantastic a blast to watch. And the beauty of the world he created is wonderful.As are the characters he creates.<br />  Update : I wrote the prior review not knowing about the next two parts. Which are as equally thrilling and entertaining as The Unexpected Journey was to watch. The next two parts are The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of The Five Armies. The detail Peter Jackson puts into all of his productions is of coarse always unequaled in the film industry. This and the following two parts were a joy to watch and worth every penny spent.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|You have to watch this series from the very beginning to see how a mild mannered chemistry teacher becomes the kingpin in meth cooking and dealing  It is so well written  You can't wait for the next show to see what happens and a whole lot happens  It is an amazing series
B0060D123K|5.0|This is a wonderful Muppet take on Dickens' perennial classic &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34;  It has everything you'd expect from a Muppet outing: lots of humor (some aimed over the kids' heads at moms & dads), great songs & music, lots of Muppets, and lots of heart.  It also manages to stay faithful enough to the source material to actually feel respectable.  Michael Caine makes a great Scrooge, though he plays it a bit less curmudgeonly than you normally find.  That's entirely appropriate since this is a family flick, and one of the great things about this movie is that it is suitable for all ages.  The ghost of Jacob Marley becomes the ghosts of Jacob & Robert Marley (played by Muppets Statler & Waldorf), and they are more funny than frightening along with the rest of the characters.  Despite its humor, the movie still has a sweet nostalgic streak that runs deep and it really is a great re-telling of a great story.  If you're looking to introduce the little ones to Dickens' classic story, if you like the Muppets, or if you just like great family holiday movies, this one is a winner.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|So many people have said they loved this book, but I was not duly impressed as I read the second and third chapters. I have been trying hard to find a good book that is not on the level of young adult. This started to feel like one to me, but thankfully that faded after the first couple chapters. The author's style can be engaging, but some of the interaction between the adult characters at times seemed immature and disingenuous. I pressed on at the urging of others, and began to find the fantasy adventure I felt I'd been promised in the reading of the first chapter. There is some good, fun adventure and the emotional parts are well conveyed. Most of the story is about the adventures of the main character retelling stories from his youth. This book is well worth the read, and I'm glad I pressed on. I found myself looking forward to reading it, and finishing it. I am looking forward to getting my hands on the next installment. I am still looking for another good, adult fantasy novel though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, better than the movies as books always are. Creative yet familiar dystopian world, but her politics and the government structure are a tab rudimentary and exaggerate archetypes.
0307743721|2.0|Each story was so compelling and yet each story left the reader hanging. I kept trying to find a link and was left quite disappointed.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Great fun.  I got this game years ago as a physical version and never really got the hang of it, but playing the virtual version is quick and easy.
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|it is a book that touches the heart of so much .... hard to define but a reading experience that develops long after the last page.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I've been thoroughly enjoying the entire series of FlipPix puzzles! Please make more!!! So far, no bugs found, as long as the original download goes well. My only complaint is that there aren't enough puzzles.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I love the grown up Nine Inch Nails!  This is an amazing step in Mr. Reznor's career, and is becoming my favorite album under the Nine Inch Nails title.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Preston and Child's character Agent Pendergast is one of the most unusual and brilliant characters in mystery/fiction since Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. I look forward to every new enstallment of the Pendergast books. They can be read as stand-alone books, by the way, but reading the series just intensifies the pleasure as each story developes Pendergast's character. And Agent Pendergast is quite the character...cool, aloof, brilliant.<br />I would give the book 5 stars, as I would have given the earlier Pendergast stories, but the usual cast of characters are not present in this story, and I guess I got a bit attached to them. If Pendergast is the &#34;bones&#34; of the story, the other supporting characters are the &#34;meat&#34;, and I guess I miss them.<br />However, a new character, introduced in the previous book, is doing her best to fill their shoes ;)<br /><br />I will be an Agent Pendergast fan until Preston and Child retire him (or kill him off).
1452115567|5.0|A wonderful humorous book foe dog lovers of all kinds! Maddy on Things is a sweet photo journal of the many places Maddy, the dog, has done. Great for a laugh!
B00DQZT38G|3.0|Awkward cover when folded back and holding with your hand. A little flimsy when standing up. Nice fit, color and material. I will be returning. Still looking for a cover that meets my needs.
1577314808|3.0|This book will make you work. It gave me some enlightenment but it's a bit too religious for me. He talks a lot about god and Jesus and I thought he should have left religion out of this....
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I am giving it 4 stars because my four year old loves it. He and his six year old cousin sit next to each other with their tablets and compete. I would probably give it 5 stars but I have only played it once.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Thought the sexual content unnessary. The only interesting and entertaining portion of this movie was the crash. Would not recommend.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I played this game for a long time it was the same old it would be more interesting if the players were easier to unlock and if they had a new song to play during the playing . But the worst part is that it glitches up so so so much I can't play a round with out pausing and it starts over every day I got on . I think it's very stupid but if you like or at least don't mind waiting around for About 5 minutes then you will love this game but if you don't well you can go and find another game to get . Other than that I like this game.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|The second full-length release from Halestorm builds on the already solid base they established with their powerful debut. Lizzy's voice of course is still at center stage, but they took some more chances with the song writing this time. Apparently years of touring allowed them to gain some confidence and refine their style which allowed them to move a little further from their comfort zone. The slow songs got deeper and the fast songs got heavier and the mid-temp rockers are dripping with attitude. The impact is immediate in the opening track, as the band rekindles the power they tapped in covering Skid Row's Slave to the Grind with a powerhouse of their own. Love Bites can go toe to toe with almost any rock song and clearly removes any notion that this is a &#34;girl band&#34; … With their debut they got their foot in the door, and here they kicked it in. Forcing the boundaries in one direction like that would be enough for most bands, but after pushing themselves to go harder, then they pulled back and delivered some even more personal and vulnerable ballads. If they had just focused on the ballads, they would have been skewered for selling out and playing into the girl band stereo type. And if they had only done the heavier stuff, their other fans would have had a fit and said they were trying too hard to prove something. In doing both they have expanded their range and insulated themselves from future expectations. The talent was apparent from the beginning, but now they are beginning to really tap into their potential. This album rocks and I can't wait to see what they do next.<br /><br />Scott - RATHOLE.com
B001R6AW18|5.0|Great movie that revolutionized the way music and film work together! Plus, of course, you have Fay Wray's screaming, which was used in other movies down the road.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|Van Halen is better with Dave. Dave is better with Van Halen. They proved they could both survive without the other, but they just aren't as good separately. Van Halen wrote some catchy songs with Hagar and made a lot of money, but so did New Kids on the Block, and I don't care about them either. And Dave's solo material maintained his manic musical personality, but he lacked borders. VH reigns Dave in a bit. Once he was on his own and calling all the shots himself, his charisma was still there, but all of his eclectic influences bubbled to the top and changed the core of the sound. I like his lyrical ideas and his unique blend of stuff, but when he went solo, he could just go completely out of the box and lose the rock part all together. I love the rock tinted by old blues; old blues by itself ... Not so much. So this gives me the best of both worlds — Weird Dave in the confines of rock music. It seems impossible to believe that it's been over 25 years since the last (REAL) Van Halen album, but that's how long it took. It would have been asking a lot to expect them to sound like they did back in 1984 and it would have been outright unrealistic to think they could recapture the more energetic, raw, guitar-oriented sound that made them famous before that, but that is just what they did. A lot has been made of the reports that they used demos from the 70s to make these songs. Sammy Hagar made jokes about them not being able to write new material, and initially I might have agreed that it was some kind of a lazy shortcut, but in hindsight, I think it was kind of brilliant. Let's face it, this whole reunion was kind of a damned if they do, damned if they don't thing. People have been screaming for it, but those same people would rip it apart if it didn't work. There was no way anything they made wasn't going to get compared to what they did together 30 years ago, and as anyone who has ever written music can tell you, it is not easy to get yourself back creatively to where you were at another time. But this worked. This actually sounds more like Women and Children First than 1984 did ... They did a better job of recapturing that sound in 2011 than they did in the early 80s and (hopefully) that will give them a good base to build on to move forward on the next one. On the downside, Dave has definitely lost the upper register of his vocal range. I would prefer he just stop trying to hit those notes and rework the melodies to something more in his comfort zone, but that is what it is. Time stands still for no (or at least very few) men. For his part, Wolfie was never going to get out of his dad's shadow as a guitarist, but he has a real chance to make a name for himself as a bass player. As for the missing Michael Anthony, like I said, I don't think the bass playing has declined as a result of his absence, but his back-up vocals are definitely missed. It's a shame, because they did everything else right, and I think that would have really put the cherry on the sundae, but I think when he sort of publicly sided with Sammy on the VanHalen/Sammy split, he was pretty much banished by the brothers VanHalen and now that he's been replaced by the offspring (thus keeping it in the family and effectively creating a 3-to-1 “VH block” to cancel out any DLR ideas that stray too far from the reservation) I don't think that we'll ever see him in the band again. So while it's not perfect, I think this was better than anyone could have hoped for, and I for one, really hope we can get at least one more album out of this group before they implode again.<br /><br />Scott - RATHOLE.comhere you were at another time.

B00CXL6XP0|4.0|The divorce has been ugly. And frankly, the fans that were so blindly lobbying on behalf of this new incarnation were so obnoxious and so arrogant that I was a little turned off by the whole project. It was months before my curiosity got the best of me and I finally listened to it. Full disclosure: I was a HUGE fan from the Warning through Empire. Anyone that knows me, knows that Operation Mindcrime is my favorite album of all time, but it's been twenty years since this band made an album that had more than two songs that caught my interest. The fall from grace has been far and completely disenfranchising and now the split has lead to a lot of finger-pointing. This faction claims that Tate was a tyrant who dictated the musical direction of the band and refused to make music similar to the style that made them famous in the 80s and early 90s. Tate claims that he was only one-fifth of the band and didn't have the power to do that on his own and that his increase in writing was a result of the band's lack of interest in the writing process. Without being there, it would be hard to know who is telling the truth, but it's hard to believe Tate's version when you put these two new Queensryche albums side by side. Tate's version is going down the same self destructive course that Queensryche has been on for the last two decades, and this one has a modern day Warning sound. I had seen some of the live YouTube videos of the LaTorre fronted Queensryche playing the old songs and it was fun, but it's one thing to match a vocal style in a song that you've already heard and something else entirely to re-create that vocal delivery on new original songs … But damn if he didn't do it. A casual listener would be hard-pressed to tell that this was not Geoff Tate singing these songs. He EARNED his place in this band. And whether Tate would admit it or not, that has GOT to be disturbing to hear his voice, his phrasing, his once so-unique style, SO completely replaced. That being said, this album is pretty good, but it's not perfect as some are claiming. To be sure, it is WAY better than everything else Queensryche released in the last 20 years, but let's be honest, that wouldn't take much. There are a few noisy spots on here and nothing that ever rivals Mindcrime, but they are definitely back on the right track with some good songs. I think my favorites are In This Light and Open Road, but I like almost all of it and it's been a long time since I could say that about a Queensryche release. I will always respect Geoff Tate and what he did on those first four albums, but THIS is Queensryche. And for the first time in a long time, I can't wait to hear what they do next. Welcome home boys.<br /><br />Scott - RATHOLE.comthis album is pretty good, but it's not perfect as some are claiming.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|i really enjoyed this book, Great perspective, great characters and great story telling. If you enjoy memoirs you will probably like this book,
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book captivated me. Being a Christian, I have hope where the characters in the book do not. Very well written but leaves you with an empty feeling.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Hubby loved it.  Me, not so much.  I would recommend seeing the first one first.  Lot of action, though. If you like Stallone, you will probably enjoy it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game! Could be a little more challenging kind of easy the animals being right in front all the time.
B003NTSBUG|3.0|Really hard to follow for me.  I might have to watch it a second time just to figure it out.  Not as good as it was rated, imho.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is one of the most played games in the United states of America<br />That's just my opinion
B0057LUI0O|5.0|I love parrots.  I loved this animated movie.  It was fun.  The characters came for life.  The big name actors doing the voices really made you feel the animation come alive.  Good for even grown ups.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy this game and spend hours playing. I love seek and fine games. This one is one of the better ones.
B004X75RK4|4.0|It had moments of being really funny.  Clean movie for a change.  Actors had good chemistry between them. I would recommend it for those wanting a somewhat sappy happy movie.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Very funny. The actor who played the son was hilarious . Jennifer Aniston was very good in this film too. Would watch it again.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|no disappointments here.  Jax and the crew are great.  I had seen them on television, but nothing is like watching the uncut version.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|What a wonderful story of life, love, history, and human nature. Who wouldn't want to join these characters while cheering them on. Can't wait for part 2!

B00H1X4F0U|4.0|nice turn based ww2 game. good graphics good game play. ad on top you can pay to remove. fun game get it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This was the 2nd book of a trilogy and focuses on the children of the characters in the first book.  It begins prior to WW 2.  The story told of the war period focuses more on spying between the countries than the battles as was done in the first book.  I enjoyed this focus as I felt it was less tedious.  I loved finding out how the new generation flourished.  I think I even enjoyed this book a little more than the first.  I will definitely read the 3rd in the trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|fun and entertaining. I even play this on my phone! the game changes cities and with each city a new theme! right now it's in london for christmas!
B00G70WLJA|5.0|Well done and far better than the first wolverine movie. I was hesitant to see it because of the first wolverine movie, but this movie was exciting to watch. This was the movie wolverine deserved.
B000WCDBKM|1.0|This is a ridiculously poor excuse for a film. Although Depp is his usual charismatically akward and mysterious self, the other cast is ridiculous and the plot is unforgivable. It is a waste of time and thoroughly silly.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Some people complained Bout the ending but when we watched the deleted scenes they had a wonderful ending that there just wasn't enough time for.
B00EAZTONU|5.0|Love the figurine with this dvd.  Hope you will have additional ones with the other two extended editions of the Hobbit.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This is my favorite James Bond movie. In the past the action scenes go on and on but these seemed more appropriately timed. Love it
B00E9A656K|1.0|It rigs you you can't even beat the first person and it is so hard it won't even allow you to costume get minecraft instead
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A look at music recording history from the 70s to today! It tells the story of a studio named Sound City where so many great things were recorded with a Neve console (Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine...). Dave Grohl ends up owning the console.This documentary shows the end of analog, the rise of digital, and the mix of both. Very cool!
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|I love this movie! It is clean and a movie the whole family can enjoy. Family friendly need I say more.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I thought the plot very well developed and the slide into the situation the main character found herself in very realistic.<br /><br />Some of the scenes in the beginning of the book were a trifle hard to believe.  The club scenes seemed to have very little bearing on the plot.  But once you got by those, the story line was good.<br /><br />There was very little doubt that any person would develop OCD due to paste experiences.<br /><br />All in all a good read but due to the graphic nature of the book not sure I would go out of my way to read another by the author.  But then I am more of a cozy type of person.  But again that is a personal preference - this was definitely a hard hitting type of book.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|Its not what I thought.  I don't like the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person.  I just wanted to read a well written story.  Not so.  I was looking forward to the movie, until I started reading the book.  It doesn't flow for me.
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|Was not suitable for the Kindle Fire. The touch and drag feature was essentially inoperable on the Kindle so I really never was able to proceed past the initial stage
B00GX598FO|1.0|Truly a horrible film with a very inane plot and fine actors who sleepwalk through the &#34;action&#34;.  Anthony Hopkins brings a bit of fun to this dreary shoot-em-up.  A real embarrassment.  Don't rent or buy this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My fiancee has a big calculator for doing bills. Once I offered her my phone calculator. She said it was useless to her because she couldn't see the small #s. I showed her this one &amp; she was impressed. I love the way it stores your data as well.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready, Player One is a superbly entertaining classic hero’s quest. The unusual piece? It takes place inside a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) in a virtual reality world called the OASIS. Our hero Parzival lives in the not-too-distant future, where people spend their days living as avatars in OASIS, an immense online wonderland. James Halliday is creator of OASIS, quintessential geek mogul and the richest person in this world. When he dies, his will specifies that his fortune be bequeathed to the first person who finds an “Easter egg”, a game treasure, hidden somewhere in the OASIS. To do you must know the minutia of 80’s pop culture down to the last detail.  Five years pass without a single clue being found. And then—you guessed it, Parzival finds the first key. He also finds that some people will stop at nothing, including murder, to find the remaining two keys before he does. Even if you have never beaten a video game or even wanted to, you will cheer on “Parzival” as he is transformed from a savvy but fairly pathetic low-level warrior into a beast mage.
B004U8VWIM|4.0|Highly rated because the dance is amazing; the relationships between and among the characters are so intense that I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen at any point.  The ending is relatively predictable, however...hence the 4/5 stars.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King at his very best! I have read almost all of Kings work. This is by far his best yet. Be sure to read The Shining first!
B00FJSSK1O|5.0|awesome band, awesome show!!! no idea why some people complained about the laser lights, they were awesome too- they must have old TV's or something!!!
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Great story, well written, can't wait for the second in the series to be translated as I have to read my mysteries in the order written!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I read this book after reading Gone Girl and couldn't put it down. I alternately couldn't bear to know what would happen next and couldn't wait to discover what did.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Will contests are generally boring, and often based on he said she said. Here we have a truly viable contest that could and has happened in real life; and Grissom exposes the true nature of lawyers and billable time!!! A super read if you life this type if novel.<br />Jamesgb
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Life long Asimov Fan, read this years ago and added it to my Kindle Library so that I could enjoy whenever I want too.
B004G600A4|5.0|The animations in this production are visually beautiful. The characters, story, and humor of the telling appeal to a great number of folks in the family, young and old.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|What you see as a hindrance or a deficiency can actually be your silver bullet.  There is hidden power in perceived weaknesses.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This product has mixed reviews.<br />You should read the manual if you get this and aren't happy with it.<br />This unit is speedy, great color and quality.<br />I love it.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's a wonderful Christmas movie that we watch every year. It's a reminder about being thankful for what we have.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I thought  since it was a mobile version of the game it would be stupid but I gave it a try and it is a cool game and it makes me want the counsel game more
B00915G6R6|5.0|No doubt this is the best series even taking into account those in cable.<br />Even if some episodes are not top, most are.<br />The writing, acting (all but especially Julianna Margulies) is terrific.<br />It shows that people is moved by power and money except in very special relations like parents-kids.<br />It also shows how America is sinking in paranoia and legalism which makes a mock of the ideas of freddom<br />that the Founding Fathers cherished.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|was a little tricky to work at first, but as soon as i got the hang of it i dont see how i lived with out it. thanks
B000ICRKLM|5.0|I love the premise of the show. It has humor without getting silly, and isn't afraid to change characters and scenarios for a new interest.
B00887490Y|1.0|Blown away by the utter failure of this movie in every sense. A small mining town near Seattle where the mines had closed down seemingly had more missing children than the remaining adults which stayed there....they all hung out at the coffee shop, half of them were po po's. Ooooh Kaaay. After a few twists & turns we find out that the once protagonist is really the antagonist....nothing really scary up to or in this revelation (just much frustration). In the end the kidnapped & her husband (he was portrayed as deceased up until the end) are made the hero & heroine for their crimes...taking the children away from their families & telling the families that they are dead. The fact that that they attempted (& succeeded) to make the viewer sympathetic to the boy's real mother only made them film more maddening. This film is insane, I am so mad & insulted that I'm finding it difficult to put into words how offensive this movie is...I actually removed it from the blu ray player & destroyed it....not only is it an attempt at providing a justification for kidnapping of children but also for telling the family's that their kidnapped children are dead....worse than pathetic.  Lets decide who can raise their kids...I have the criteria
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use standard calculator. I have not had any problems with this app at all. I would recommend this app for basic calculations. Very reliable.
B004JRVQX0|3.0|It actually works pretty well with Pro Tools 11 But the thing is that I don't need this cause there is already one in my&#34;Pro tools 11 DVD version&#34;. However, amazon bundled them which make me spend 40$ more.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Kids loved it.  At 4 and 6, my kids tend to lose interest easily. Yet, they always stay focused with this movie.
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|Superb!!! This is a gem. The sound quality is good and the presentation is great. Is a must for a beatlemaniac
B003O86FMW|4.0|Lots of twists and turns.  I did not expect where the story was going To go. just want to want to read more.
B005C8SPHK|5.0|have been looking for this for ages, had it back in the 80's. great to have it in my collection again.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Addictive beat to the songs. Besides the one constant airplay &#34;Royals&#34;, many other songs are worth a deeper listen. My kids love the tunes as well.
B000002UZ1|5.0|What can I say I'm old and like old songs, spent a lot of time in the Navy at sea so these sons being back lots of memories.  My favorite song is Revolution which I play a lot when walking the dogs every day.  War is for the young and memories are for the old.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|There are a lot of characters to get to know, but worth the time invested to do so. Interesting character development and morality issues. Unexpected twists and turns  I really enjoyed this book.
0131480057|4.0|This is a very well written Linux & Unix Admin book.  What I love about it is it sticks to the point, and it shows most &#34;how to&#34;'s in multiple flavors of Unix and Linux.  (THe most popular distros... So Unix that is production AIX, Solaris, and for Linux Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Debian variants) which covers most as others are branches off the main tree's of linux...  It is the one I keep on my desk.
B001KN6C9E|4.0|It is hard to beleive this  was covered up for so many years because of politics. I highly recommend it. Easy to read, hard to visualize.
0670024856|5.0|So imaginative and interesting - I could hardly put it down.  Certainly another slice of life that most of us know nothing about.  Thank goodness for being born in the 20th Century!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game for kids.  My granddaughters, (5 and 9)  love this game and play it more than other games on the kindle.
B00ELERCO8|1.0|I really can't even give it one star since I haven't been able to use it.  I can't find where to click the &#34;I agree&#34; to the terms to get the app to even open.  I don't hate it - I can't love it...I removed it from my Kindle.  What good is something you can't even open?
B002VECM4A|5.0|This item has met or exceeded my expect ions. I would recommend this product to my friends and family anytime.
B00881VLCE|1.0|It would be greater if it didn't cause the security warning to constantly pop up on all of my Internet searches. I have already had to completely empty my kindle and then reload Twice in two weeks.  I cant get rid of the security warning unless I remove all apps and then I'm fine until I reload magic puzzles.

B005ZI2X4I|2.0|Story seemed backwards to me and why kids home with colds, missing a good snow day, would be worried about alligators --- just didn't make sense to me. Could be a better way to encourage snowman building! Maybe if your state has alligators.........

1465414444|4.0|As an early role playing enthusiast, I cut my teeth with the old Dungeons and dragons PC games, no multiplayer and rudimentary graphics. By the time WoW (World of Warcraft for those living in another planet) came out and with it, a slew of MMORPG, I was a bit beyond playing these games and never went for the massive online playing experience. I always considered World of Warcraft as the dark side, game that killed the individual role playing computer game.<br />This book prompted me to take a look at the dark side.<br />It is a beautifully illustrated, comprehensive and concise look at the world of Azeroth. Now I basically know what everyone is raving about and can understand some of it. What is the Horde and who are the Alliance.<br />I might even give it a try.<br />In essence, this book would be a great gift for any WoW wargamer in your list, or for the parents of one who want to know what their offspring is doing stuck to a computer screen for hours at a time.

B00435WX7G|4.0|In the description it says &#34;Colored plastic; no paint required.&#34; So I kind of thought: 1) snap together 2) done. But that doesn't look to be the case. I was aware that the figures had to be painted, but I did not read all of the reviews when I decided to buy it, so I didn't know that for the color you are given stickers to apply to the model. I, as of now, do not care for that.<br /><br />I took a couple of pictures of all the pieces so that people could see what you had to work with, but unfortunately I don't know how to add them to the images on the product page. If someone reads this review and knows how, feel free to let me know so I can add them.<br /><br />I am going to see what it looks like with the stickers on, but I don't personally have high hopes. The other reviews say it looks nice.. but I don't believe the stickers are going to look great on it because the main image looks like it was a painted model. My father has been building models for as long as I can remember and none of them used stickers like the ones included in this set. Even with the included stickers, the main image (and the images on the box) look to have waaaaay better detail. If I turn out to be wrong then I will change my review saying I was an idiot for thinking it would require to be painted to look nice.<br /><br />It's going to take some time to put it all together definitely. But if you want it to look like a gorgeous model of the Going Merry that is going to do it justice, plan ahead that you are going to probably have to throw some paint on it.

B008MM9630|4.0|Can't locate a few of the items....need help in finding them.  Otherwise, it's a pretty cool game.  The graphics are pretty cool too...relaxing to a point.
B009GI8J1O|1.0|I guess I just don't get it.  I think he could have done a better job connecting these stories. I felt  like I was reading a number of very different stories that  were just slapped together and then called a novel. A waste of time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wow, what a page burner. Read this just as fast as A Time To Kill, my all-time favorite from John Grisham. Can't wait to see the movie.<br />Jerry
B009CG29RK|5.0|Great feel good kid movie. I expected it to not be as good as the first one, and I was pleasantly surprised as to how good this one was. Minions just as awesome as always! Well worth a watch. Not sure I would buy the full version for my children again if I had to think about it however since they haven't really replayed it much, maybe better to rent this movie and repeat it until they get tired of it.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|By far the best flight simulator for kindle<br />I just wish the campaign was longer but I still play free flight all the time
B001OSIV62|5.0|Nice story about a french dude who liked to climb around on wires and other stuff...then walked across the Twin Towers on a wire.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|Just be ready to cry.... A lot. But seriously what a great book. This story about an orphan girl growing up in nazi Germany and tells a side to a story that has been mostly ignored. Her experience growing up during the third reicht, losing people she loves, and learning to read and write is told from the point of view of death himself. Really good.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Even though the style of writing was quite different, this is one of the best books I've ever read. The scenes & characters will stay with me for a long time. I can't stop thinking about each one and the tragedies of WWII. As I was reading I felt their pain & wanted a good outcome for them all, but war doesn't do that. I totally recommend this book.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Good music which was enjoyed by all.  Brought back some old family memories. This music is a classic. Good for family listening.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|We love British films. Anything with Dame Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, who have both aged gracefully WITHOUT HOLLYWOOD PLASTIC SURGERY! This is a wonderful and spirit lifting film in the vein of Enchanted April and Cold Comfort Farm. 2 other films I would highly recommend as well as this one!

B00ENXBUR2|4.0|Product Review - I give the packaging 4 stars. I love that this is real aluminum casing, not just sprayed on metallic ink.  The inserts are also nice looking and fold perfectly together in a trifold that makes the shield shape. The only complaint is the plastic stand. It may just be my item that had this problem, but I found it very flimsy and would tip over and detach with any little nudge. A little gorilla glue, and problem solved, however the stand could have been better. Also, no,  there is no digital copy you can use to download on iTunes. It sucks, I know, but you can't get everything. Overall, I am happy with my Collectors Edition.<br /><br />***Minor Spoilers to Follow****<br /><br />This is the Batman Begins for Superman. It is a modern and more mature take on the character. Gone are the ridiculous ideas that Lois would not find out who Clark is. That no one in Smallville knows of the incredible gift/curse Clark has. That everyone would just accept him. This is a movie where it places you in todays world and all of a sudden this Godlike being that is an Alien, is revealed to have been living among us. Proving that there is intelligent life beyond our solar system. What kind of reaction would the world have? They would obviously be terrified, as the movie states and shows repeatedly. As Clarks father tells him in one touching scene, \\"People are afraid of what they don't understand\\". Superman is living in a xenophobic world. And yet, as much as humans have treated him badly, he still has faith that the human race is good, and those are the people he fights for. There is no cockiness and lame one liners/jokes here like you see in Iron Man, and Thor. Superman stays humble and good natured as presented exceptionally well by Henry Cavill's subtle performance.<br /><br />No movie is without it's flaws however. Yes it's true, there's LOTS of CGI, and lots of action/destruction. It can be overwhelming at times with so much going on. I would say this movie does overdo it a little bit, but compared to the snooze-fest that's Superman Returns, it's an improvement. Another negative is that some things are not fully explained. I suppose the writer/director wanted the viewer to make the connections. They are not fully explainable unless you've seen the movie a couple of times. I liked having to figure some of those questions out on my own, but some people probably would prefer it'd be more straight forward. An example being how the main villain was able to master his newfound powers in such a short timespan. Another thing that may distract the viewer is the non-linear story structure. There are repeated flashbacks that take place throughout the movie. It didn't bother me, but it may cause problems for some people. There are also a few religious undertones some viewers may not like for whatever reason, such as a moment where Clark goes to his local church to ask for advice from a priest. That didn't bother me but it did to quite a few people.<br /><br />All in all, behind that lies a really good origin story for a character many have written off as outdated. This movie will change your mind. Just give it a chance and go in with a clear conscious.<br /><br />Highlights of the Film:<br />The first 30 minutes on the world of Krypton. (If you liked the Epic final battle on Avatar, this is very similar)<br />Supermans first flight<br />Lois helps Superman Escape (Yes, finally a smart, risk taking investigative reporter Lois Lane!)<br />The Battle of Smallville<br />Superman VS the World Engine (This is a truly inspiring scene)ois Lane!)<br />The Battle of Smallville<br />Superman VS the World Engine (This is a truly inspiring scene)<br />Battle of Metropolis

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Masterful acting and BBC quality as well as Masterpiece Theatre quality!!  I thank Amazon Prime for including British dramas and comedies!!  Our favorite programs also on PBS are included - mature thinking adults will praise your inclusion of these programs.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  David Weber is an amazing storyteller.  His characters are full and three dimensional.  They all have flaws, like real humans, and he lets those flaws be part of the story.  Honor doesn't always do the right thing, like some omniscient space captain in other books would do.  But she lives up to her principles making the best decision she can based on what she is capable of at the moment like we should all try to do.  Weber writes about war and portrays it as bloody and horrible as it is in real life.  The deaths aren't always clean and quick from laser weapons like some science fiction writers portray with the good guys all hiding behind fancy impenetrable shields.  Even though you need a war in a military fiction book, you close the book knowing peace is a better option.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Never have I so longed for the kiss of a German orphan girl, the taste of pea soup or adequate intelligence to express my love and loathing for the words.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The final book in this series is all I could hope for in a final book. At certain points I didn't want to keep reading because I feared what was going to happen, but in the end it was a beautiful story of love and overcoming life's hardest curve balls.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Same concerns as most readers.<br /><br />1. Got lost between tris and tobias's voice-no distinct character voice for tobias<br />2. Tristan and Tobias were very different from previous books<br />3. I mean come on, the awful, unnecessary lazy ending that was selfish<br /><br />I am frustrated with the ending so much that in my head ive tried to rewrite the story in a way that is more in line with the series I fell in love with. It could've been great. Veronica Roth should pretend that allegiant was a fear simulation for Tobias and then write &#34;allegiant: outside the fear&#34;
B00FMAZ49U|5.0|I wasn't of fan of screen protectors in the past, mainly due to the fact that they typically degrade screen visibility and for the other little quirks that come along with them(bubbles, messy installs, etc.).  Long story short, a trip to the beach and a scratched Galaxy Nexus screen later, and I was at a crossroads - either replace a screen protector or replace a screen.  Took a chance on this Spigen protector and was very pleasantly surprised; the quality is beyond reproach, as I can honestly say that I see no discernible difference between the bare screen and the protected screen; the clarity is impeccable.  Installation was a breeze as well.  For prospective buyers, I would highly recommend using an air blower, such as a Giottos Rocket Blaster(DO NOT USE COMPRESSED AIR) or something similar, prior to and during installation.  It works unbelievably well for clearing away dust, with the added benefit of leaving no smudges behind the way a cleaning cloth would.  I've already purchased an extra pair for that next beach trip.

B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I laughed from start to finish and so rarely are comedies these days really laugh out loud funny.  Sure, it's all relative but hey, my review.  I don't care what you say - the rap scene and the swollen beans were hilarious.  One, I'd never really known the lyrics and two, well, swollen beans - awesome sauce!

B0063FGG22|5.0|Classic movie with updated view. Don't know how they can do it but the quality of the film is very good. I have always enjoyed this film and now even moreso.
0316227706|5.0|I read about this book in one of the magazines I read. The pictures are amazing and if you are ever feeling blue all you have to do is look at this book and it will make you smile. It sits on my desk and anyone that notices, picks it up and comments. You can just imagine being there.

B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Man of Steel is the quintessential Superman Movie. This movie is for people who love the Superman character. This movie is not for people who loved the now out-dated 1978 Richard Donner/Christopher Reeves classic. It is an up-to-date retelling of the modern-age superman presented in the current comic books. This IS a comic book movie and as such it should and does relate perfectly to the source material. Those looking to rekindle their Christopher Reeves love affair need not apply.<br /><br />From the cinematography to the music (Quite possibly Hans Zimmer's greatest score) to the cast selection, to the acting; Man of Steel never fails to disappoint. Gone are the bumbling antics of 1978's Clark Kent and it it's place is a character that is not so much trying to &#34;fool&#34; everyone but trying to find out where he fits in. Aside from some minor pacing issues, Man of Steel is solid fun. 2.5 hours of escapism is exactly what the summer ordered and Man of Steel delivers.

B0013KTGAG|3.0|The first half of the movie was great. Then it appeared they switched directors. The second half was choppy and confusing. The camera was jerky and the story line went down hill. Why?!?!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great story. Not quite as predictable as a lot of grisham's work, but still able to figure out the end retry early on.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|When I first read the low star reviews, I was a little hesitant about this book. Allegiant was literally like a rollercoaster ride for me. The end was beautiful yet tragic. I recommend you to be prepared for the events that conclude this book and the series. The book really did show me how strong love, and true love can be.

B00000I8UF|5.0|Done in 1958, it is still well worth listening to. Great quintet of Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, Bobby Timmons, Jymie Merritt, and Art Blakey himself on drums. Most of the songs are written by Timmons or Golson, but everyone contributes to this excellent set of recordings.
0385537131|3.0|I usually really like Grisham's books, but this fell a little short, especially at the end.<br /><br />First of all, it was promoted as a sequel to &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; but except for the same main character (Jake) and the setting, it is not really a sequel.<br /><br />Grisham has a talent for the plot twist and I was waiting for this to happen.  About half way through, I thought I had figured it out, but I was wrong.  I'll write what I thought would take place further in this review (after the SPOILER ALERT).<br /><br />Some parts of the story didn't gel well together and some seemed a bit to coincidental.  OKAY...don't read the next part if you haven't read the book:<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />One of the details that irritated me was that they said they couldn't find Seth's brother for a long time in spite of spending $50,000 on private detectives...and yet...it turns out that he was in the Navy under his real name.<br /><br />Here's what I thought would happen:  When Lettie's husband is drunk and kills the two local high school athletes in a car accident, I thought this would be an important part of the story.  It really wasn't.  What could have been done was to have all the lawyers thinking that Lettie would lose but the jury turn out and give her all the money because then she could make a settlement to the family of the two boys.  It would have been a surprise ending for the jury to do that!<br /><br />Okay...these are just my thoughts, but I hope they help others decide on the book.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|While I didn't enjoy it as much as their previous CDs, it was still an enjoyable listen. Kind of miss the catchy songs.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love Castle, the TV show and have watched and watched many re-runs...this book keeps up the fiction of the TV character's writing a novel about the TV character he shadows (Beckett)...&#34;Heat Wave&#34; is referred to in the show...interaction of the characters was different, in accord with the difference that the TV Castle sets up...it's a fun dash...I don't know if I would have liked it as much if I didn't know how it was connected to the show...but, hey, spend a couple bucks (Kindle it) and have a good time...

1935597760|4.0|By tradeemup . . .  If only the author had given more space to the ending!  It was a wonderful book and had the last quarter of it been more developed, it would have rated six stars.  There was a very interesting set-up toward the end, but the author rushed through it.

B00GSJ9X4Q|3.0|I don't own this drive but have done a lot of research.  It's a great idea! Too bad the SSD from WD in this drive is a lot slower than other SSDs on the market like the latest Intel drives and the Samsung EVO series.  The drive reads aren't terrible but the writes are pretty slow compared to other SATA III SSDs out there.  Great concept though and it will definitely be faster than any spindle based HDD for your OS files.  SSD prices are coming down though so unless you really need the 1TB of space, hunt around and you can find a nice size SSD only for under or around $300.  I picked up a few 500GB Samsung EVO drives for about $280 during all the Black Friday sales and prices will continue to drop.

1476729085|4.0|Don Tillman has carved a niche for himself at the University in Melbourne, but finds his world tipped sideways by unfamiliar sensations when he meets Rosie, a free spirited student, and the plot turns into somewhat a Mama Mia! search for her biological father.<br /><br />This book surprised me.  Starting with a reliable narrator, because he is hardwired to be that way, what seemed to be a run of the mill romantic comedy evolved into an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself and remain unaffected by popular opinion.  I was reminded of Motherless Brooklyn, Curious Incident of Dog etc., but those books along with this one were novels with fictitious narrators diagnosed with neurological anomalies.  I also thought of Why I jump, a memoir by an autistic boy of 14, which proves that more is going on than is visible to the observer.  At the age of 40, Don comes of age in this book, as does Rosie to a certain extent.  It's a fast read, but fun and worth the time.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I was very disappointed with this book. I loved everything in it but the last three pages. I wish it would have ended better than that because it made me sad to think that Alex and Lena went through all of that for nothing. If it wasn't for the ending I would have put five stars.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of those books you don't want to come to the end of just because you love the plot and the characters.  Mr. Grisham doesn't disappoint.

B005ERIRZE|5.0|Doctor McGonigal sparks interest, inspires, and tickles with her delightful anecdotes while serving up a healthy course of strong lessons.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Skyfall hass good action and good story line.  Has no lurid sex scenes, although language and violence would perhaps make it off limits to younger viewers.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to action movie enthusiasts.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|This Bond movie seemed to stagger along.  Opens with long fight scene with strange twist and Bond is dead. Sorry, impossibly not dead. He has sex with the beautiful woman who gets promptly executed. No big deal. Quick and gruesome. Next.  Things stagger along like this interminably until we have a new Ms. Moneypenny and some vague promise that the franchise is now brand new again.  Huh?
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Grisham's name sold this book to me.  Unfortunately it is a big bore with too many characters, none of whom really come to life.  And the plot meanders hither and yon and lacks any real punch.  Try something else.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best. Intrigue, lies, cheating, breaking the law, sex. What else can you ask for? I love every episode and missed this one. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the best, BITCH!
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Extremely slow, details repeated numerous times. Boring. Very disappointing. Predictable ending. I would definitely think twice before purchasing another &#34;Grisham&#34; novel.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Characters are very well developed, the story line keeps you involved and interested.  Although if you are having trouble getting into the story I would suggest getting through the first 1/3 of the book, and it opens out and becomes clear.
B00CC86RPA|5.0|One of the most under rated comedy's. It is a raunchy spoof on legend and quest movies from the past with an all star cast and excellent comedic writing.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. one that both me and my daughter enjoy playing!!! I recommend. downloading!!!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Those of us who hang on every word written by the duo Preston and Child would not rate their stories less than five stars.  The protagonist, Special Agent Pendergast, in his understated genius kind of way draws the readers through every page to the end all to quickly.  Then we are like hungry children waiting the next novel.  The stories are always fresh, the characters are dependable, the suspense delicious.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Hits every state of emotion, Great Album ! ! !<br />So good, i keep it on repeat and louder every time ! ! !
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Five stars! Brilliant. Interesting concept.<br />This book read like poetry. The \\"words\\" painted emotional and vivid pictures for me.  This is one of the best reads I have had in a long time.
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|I want my money back  it takes up to much space I'll have to wait a whole week do not get this app it's a waste of money
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is hilarious. This is coming from one who has always thought she is not able to run. I have adult children who run. One them loves her Vibram 5 Fingers. I often wished I could run with them, but at my age, fast walking is the best I could do. Reading this book made me want to jump on a treadmill and give running a good try. In the middle of Chapter 25, I group texted my kids and told them to include Vibrams on my Christmas list.
B00FX8F6VM|5.0|This is the ONLY song (personally) from this album that I think is amazing. Everyone likes KP's song &#34;ROAR&#34;, but I don't care for that song. However, &#34;Dark Horse&#34; has the right beat, the right lyrics. It's catchy and overall amazing!
B004D2A04M|2.0|Got this to hold my Fenix PD32.  For what it's worth, it holds (held) my light very well and there were no worries that my expensive piece of gear would fall out of the holster on some trail somewhere.  Unfortunately, the holster is attached to the belt clip with a fairly fragile plastic clip that broke while I was reinserting my flashlight one night.  I'd had the holster for a month or so and it always felt a little bit wobbly at the joint, but I wasn't expecting it to snap off so easily.  Surprising, given the quality of Fenix's other gear.<br /><br />Oh well, it was cheap so I won't complain too loudly, but I most certainly won't be buying another AB02 to replace it.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|A classic takeoff on the original Star Trek flawed only by uneven acting. Watch the voice overs in the last few action scenes.
0545586178|5.0|I read this book because I was going to see the movie and I'm glad that I did. It helped to explain some of the smaller details in the movie that I otherwise would have missed. Overall I loved this book and believe that even people who don't like futuristic type books would thoroughly enjoy. The first book was amazing but compared to this just paved the way for the second. I can't wait to see what the third holds inshore for the end to the series. If you get this book the 'odds are ever in your favor.'
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Its very thrilling and I love watching a family come together at everything life throws at them. I can't wait for Season 4!!!!
B0007TKNII|4.0|Excellent version of a classic movie.  I was surprised that Gerard Butler could handle this type of roll.  Highly recommended.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The feel of a PlayStation controller can not be beat.  I like that this controller can be used wirelessly and it responds well, I just wish the battery would last longer.  It really doesn't get more than two good hours of battery before it starts to fade out and it doesn't recharge while the PS is off.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|I keep lending this DVD out and never get it back.  It is hilarious and I am a Heath Ledger fan.  Plus, look it up in the Encyclopedia.  The story is a diary by a real person.  Plus, great scenes of Venice.  (I've been there.)
B00867GHS8|5.0|Seeing this classic in 3-D was very enjoyable for the young and not so young as well. The 3-D was well done and worth the expense!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual, Grisham spins a great tale with colorful characters and uniquely crafted twists.  Jake Brigance is very real and Lucien Wilbanks reminds me of my brilliant drunken uncles that could have owned the world if not for Irish whiskey.<br /><br />I will say that John Grisham and Mark Gimenez have made reading fiction a real pleasure in 2013.  Read everything either writes.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks and his ability to take on such a variety convincing roles. The movie is deep, and requires us to really dig in. The second time through made it really come alive for us and is now a resounding favorite.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game so far. Just creepy enough to pique my curiosity and get me to buy the unlocked version.<br />Will let u know how the rest of the game goes.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|for me its a boring game its good I didn't buy it I tried it because my siblings love it but I guess its just not some people type of game
B003O86FMW|5.0|I tells about how the enemy is not who you think and you can't always trust everyone you think good because once you may know them they could turn on you Instantly. Catching fire tells of how nightmares compare to life like encounters.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have to give this 3 stars because I would have quit reading it during the first 3rd of the book if I hadn't been reading it for a book club.  That said, the story really picked up after that and I enjoyed the remainder very much.  Hosseini intertwines the characters in a compelling manner and I found the story quite beautiful (albeit a little sad) at the end.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Gone Girl is still my favorite. After reading her books I am certain I have lived a very sheltered life!
B001TY8EFY|5.0|This is one of the finest movies ever made in this genre.  I cannot overstate the quality in the acting, production and locations that went into this film.  If you are not some sort of bible-thumping automaton or simply too dense to appreciate it, then I highly recommend this beautiful piece of art.  In my youth I actually carried a VHS copy with me as I travelled this country, showing it to as many people as I could...I hope watching it brings you the joy that fills me every time I see it - which is as often as I can.  The entire film plays out on screen like a renaissance masters painting in motion, with a soundtrack to match.  Incomparable.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I use this in a hospital settinf with mentally ill patients in a large state hospital.  I have tried other products but all have extraneous dialogue talking abouI turning the lights off and other uncecessary things and this one sticks to a valuable and beautiful guided meditation.<br />I have also found that playing it while I am working on my canvas at home with my own artistic endevors to be quite valuable.  The guided breathing is quit useful to stay relaxed.<br />I only wish there were a way to have it play perodically with external music sources so I could play other peices of inspiring music I enjoy while working with my art and perodically come on automatically... just an Idea
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|It was an okay story, with okay acting from what should have been super star actors with high-power presence. But it wasn't that way to me. Being a real father-and-son team should have come across on the screen, but I kept getting the feeling that neither was really into their roles. Or, maybe that's what they wanted? Anyway I just did not think this movie was very good overall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am older and It keeps my mind working.  It also keeps you in touch with friends and family asking for lives  lol
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this sight.. I am artistic and there are so many things that catch my eye..I have belonged to this site for  long time..

0307957837|5.0|This is a great book by a great author. Don't think because you've seen the movie that you know the story. Two entirely separate creatures.
B001AITGWE|5.0|its an awesome movie. I could see myself going nutso in a whammy burger or something like it..it may not be right but I understand!
B000Q67876|5.0|Isn't it the best movie ever? IMDB says so. You have to listen to IMDB. It's the law. Do it.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Fantastic performance.  We are longtime fans of Les Mis' and this DVD brings the show up close and personal.  You won't be disappointed.<br />We have seen 5 live performances and a telecast live show in the movie theater.  Now, we can enjoy the performance at home.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|What a great, fantastic story! Finished one day after the death of Nelson Mandela, so I cannot help but see many parallels.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a little girl. I still enjoy seeing it every year. There is a lot of joy in this movie.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Okay I will say up front that I had low expectations for this book.  I have not been overly impressed by the writing style and repetitive nature of this book series on a whole but it is a pretty modern day fairytale so I have stuck with them.  This one was just rediculously though. It lost me when the primary antagonist just suddenly, out of no where, has this deep connection to our main couple... Oh, and a trained puppet minion to boot.  Really, I could practically hear the stretching as I read it.  To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Nice movie and good adventure. The plot is easy understand and the animation is almost realistic. It is good for the family to see
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love everything about this show, the period in which it is set, the wardrobe, the script and the acting. Wish I could view through my TV, but their are no directions given by Amazon.
0688152023|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, but it wasn't what I expected.<br />While it lived up to its name -50 stretches anyone can do- I found most of the stretches to be basic, or somewhat out of date.<br />For someone just getting into fitness or not sure where to start this guide would be great, but it wasn't for me.<br />Another reviewer commented that some of the photos of the men were kind of...weird, and since it was only a single reviewer who had this complaint I didn't pay much attention, but as I flipped through the book it was something I noticed too -and I didn't care for it.<br />My advice:  If your local library has it, check it out first to see if its something you want to pay money for.  My library didn't, so I bought it -but that's where the copy ended up.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Liane Moriarty is currently one of my favorite authors. I love how she explores human psychology and behavior through fiction.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This a really fun app and hard to get off of i highly recommend this game love it so much
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I had the free version of this. Got this when it was the faotd. I really can only say good things about this game. It&quot;s fun. Some levels are really easy and you get through them quickly and easily while others are much more challenging and you have to think and figure it out. This is great when you have some time to kill. If you missed this as the faotd you can get the free version. It' s pretty close to the same.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Extremely well written...A masteful storeyteller weaving a sinister future of politico/religious lies..The wool is literally pulled over the populations eyes..The heroine is real...fleshed out and human..
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a fun game to play when I am trying to relax. I like solitare and this is an amusing one.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|A long time fan of EWF, this new CD does not disappoint! Sure I miss Maurice, but the songs have energy and the power that the group has had all along. This one grows on you, you'll be singing it in traffic!!!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a fabulously engaging book. I couldn't put it down. And because I was afraid I would't be able to pick it up (741 pages!) I got it on my Kindle and ripped through it in a week-end. Take it on a cross country airplane trip or just snuggle up with it by the fire on a snowy day. A guaranteed pleasure.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Fast read, interesting characters and subject.  It reminded me a lot of the movie the &#34;Intouchables&#34; from a year or 2 ago.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book especially for anyone who enjoys conspiracy books.  Has a great concept  and I can't wait to read the rest of the silo series.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A real challenge.  I think my dad for the knowledge of construction he passed on to me.  Very helpful in collapsing those structures just to get to a frog.  Who wouldn't enjoy that?

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I won't bother to give a synopsis of the story. I will say that as far as sequels are concerned, this one could not have been better. As a fan of Stephen King I have missed the feeling that his stories used to leave me with. I've missed the terrible 'surety' that not all things will necessary end with a happily ever after as if I was reading a fairytale. I have missed the utter creepiness that is discovered beneath everything that we might take for granted.<br /><br />It is why I have decided to rate this book instead of setting it aside in disappointment. The Stephen King of old peeks through the pages of Doctor Sleep--but more importantly a 'new and improved' Stephen King seems to have emerged. Though he has not gotten over all of the quirks that are both maddening and predictable--yet somehow comforting in its familiarity (sage old black man, annoying repetition of a profound thought or idea--had it not been overused half a million times, a smart compassionate kid--maybe just a tad too smart, and that lurking bad man that touches kids), I will say that he has controlled that over-descriptiveness that he is so known for. Maybe too much as I lost a sense of what Dan Torrance looked like.<br /><br />But one big change in his writing is the concept that you don't have to lose in order to win. And I hooted and hollered when Doctor Sleep transformed into a 'kick-ass' action story. I won't say anymore on that. Doctor Sleep is not a perfect story. I think it continued long after I would have been happy to read; THE END and some beloved characters were not given much in the way of 'closure' while other lesser known characters were spotlighted--leaving me to shrug and wonder why. More than most stories, this one makes me wonder what dark monsters lurk in Stephen King's head and if writing this story has helped to get rid of them. It just has that feel to me. Doctor Sleep gets five stars and two thumbs up.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This movie was awesome, especially in 3D which is how I saw it in the theater. Owning a 3D TV, I automatically buy the best movies in 3D. It's not quite the same as in the theater, but it comes pretty close. Watching the starships go flying is pretty awesome! And the fight scene on top of the ship was amazing. If you own a 3D TV, then you need to get this version. And the price was right.

B00B5HQL50|4.0|It competes with previous 007 episodes.  Entertains from beginning to end with all of the expected actions and the typical bad guy character is great.

B004UXUX4Q|3.0|This movie created considerable buzz when it was released, but it's hard to see exactly why at this distance.  It's well acted and well shot, but it seems thin, and a movie about the weight of the past on the present can't afford to seem thin.  There are two pasts in question: first, the past of the marriage of Matt and Elizabeth King (George Clooney is Matt); then there's the past of the Hawaiian island, a large chunk of which Matt's family has inherited and which is held under trust, with Matt the trustee.  We never see Matt's marriage; we have to take it for granted that it's at a crisis (because we're told), but Elizabeth is in an irreversible coma when George learns, from his elder daughter, that she was having an affair at the time of the accident that has made her comatose.  If ever flashbacks of a substantive kind were needed, it's in a situation like this.  Without them, we remain a bit disconnected from Matt's inner life.  Clooney has to try to suggest a complexity that the movie doesn't underwrite, and I don't think that an actor can easily do that.  We see the past of the island insofar as it effects Matt's family in the shots of the land they own -- beautiful unspoiled land.  We can see it, and we get a connection to it that we don't get to Matt's marriage (shots of his comatose wife don't do that).  The two come together when Matt learns that the man with whom his wife is having an affair stands to profit very handily for managing the transfer of property in the event that the sale goes through.  Matt as trustee has the power of decision -- he can make his rather wastrel relatives millionaires, or he can preserve the land (at least for a while).  If he doesn't sell, what's his motive?<br /><br />George Clooney has too little to work with here.  He does fine, but it's a thin role.  Matt's daughters, with less history, are more interesting, and the two young actors (Amara Miller and Shailene Woodley) are very good.  Beau Bridges, as one of Matt's cousins hoping for millions, is underused.  Judy Greer, as the wife of the man whom Elizabeth has been involved with, has a strong scene near the end.  It's credible because she plays a woman reacting to a history she doesn't really know, and she does it splendidly.<br /><br />The problems, then, are with the concept (and to a lesser degree with the writing).  Obviously, it's tonally challenging to blend comic elements with so many shots of a dying woman -- and Elizabeth takes the whole movie to die.  To an extent, Payne manages the blend reasonably -- thanks partly to Sid (Nick Krause), Matt's elder daughter's surfer dude boyfriend, a character who ends up being less stupid than he looks.  Clooney's contribution to the humor -- quite well done -- is his acting the part of a father who is learning on the job, so to speak.  Still -- it doesn't add up to much.  It lacks real emotional power.  What might Mike Leigh have done with a story like this?hoping for millions, is underused.
