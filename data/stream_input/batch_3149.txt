B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|All in all I would give 4 stars and recommend this book  to anyone who enjoys a good, suspenseful, riveting story. I'd go so far as to say it's Grishams best book in a long time. This book grabbed me from the very first page and I read into the wee hours each night because Mr. Grisham kept  teasing me to read just one more, no, two more pages... That is, until the end. I still felt the desire to read but the urge had waned because the writing intensity had waned. The climax was OK, but not to the standards of earlier chapters. The explanation of why Seth wrote his will was fairly lame and presented in a &#34;deus ex machina&#34; sort of way. The final chapter was interesting but I think of the judge as old and frail and doubt he could live long enough to carry out his part of his plan.<br />In any case, I look forward to Grisham's next book and hope he can keep the intensity all the way to the end.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I don't normally like reading about this devastating era in human history but this book is an unforgettable exception. Brilliantly written!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|It was awesome after  playing with a used old controller for so long it was awesome to see what a game cube controller really looks like also great quality

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app it shows you a lot of the things it takes to be able to care for a horse your self I know it's not real but it helps.
B00ELERCO8|1.0|This app does not work on my kindle fire HD 8.9. There is no way to accept the user agreement.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I liked everything about it. John green does a great job in describing every single detail that it makes it seem like your Q. It makes u not want to stop reading. I recommend this book to senior students mainly so they apply it to their life's but it's really for anyone of any age to read and understand the meaning of the book
B000FBJAOG|3.0|Its got good points to it. My husband likes to read it and consider how the guide could be applied to other situations
B004TVOBOM|5.0|I love this book and try to get it for the babies in our family. It was wonderful to find it available from this seller.<br />It arrived as described and in perfect , new condition! Thank you.
B00FTGYNUS|5.0|I have been waiting for this DVD!  I have been to several of her Concerts and I saw The Truth About Love Tour twice this year!  I own every one of her Concerts on DVD and they never get old!  It is simply amazing how she has done this tour for a year while being a Mom of one beautiful baby girl!  Balance - Mother and Entertainer = P!NK!  P!nk is the BEST EVER!  HANDS DOWN!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is the best game ever &lt;3 &amp; now they should put minecraft pocket edition free on the kindle !
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Although Kay Scarpetta,her family, and coworkers are always portrayed as multi-dimensional characters,this time<br />I thought there was way too much extraneous background details. I found my self skimming some pages till I found information pertinent to this novel. Some passages very tedious dissertations on Marino/Lucy/Benton and their history with Scarpetta. It was an interesting crime,with quite a few twists that kept you guessing,but the reselling of the relationship histories was tough going.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Gives me such a warm feeling especially her singing with Elvis and Johnny Mathis.  I think my favorite is Little Drummer Boy.  This album no one is holding her back and letting her true talent shine!
0439023513|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!! I finished reading Catching Fire and wanted to read the next as soon as I finished it but could not find the book for less than $18.99, but then I found this one for only about $11 and I was thrilled! I got it with Amazon Prime, and was able to read it two days later!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|My wife and I are Casket fans and had missed a couple of Season Five episodes; this collection rounded it out.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I was disappointed in the ending. The story seemed to drag on.  GRISHAM did an excellent job of character creation. He could have done so much more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Ad free, great graphics, and lot of play time. Recently updated for new maps and weapons.<br />WARNING : Do not buy if you are one of those people who have no patience and rage-quits because you will either hate this or end up spending money(which is totally not require,just takes time).
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really good game, very addictive, only problem is it has been quite slow to load at times, but overall really really good
B003MYYJD0|5.0|It's plenty big, colorful, and important looking. I get a lot of compliments on it....and<br />for the price I paid; you just can't beat it!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome but it takes too long to get energy cores. Other than that it's a great game for everyone
0789420708|5.0|The picture are beautiful and colors are good too.  Illustrations are detailed and true.  The historical references were little sparse for my taste, but this is mainly for the kids reading.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I am not usually a fan of todays music, but wow Imagine Dragons are great. I got the album and loved all, but two songs (Every Night and Underdog) and now I am going to a concert in March.
B00CITOS4A|5.0|I'm a Kelby-holic. I enjoy his writing style. That said - really Scott - couldn't you just have called this &#34;Part 5&#34; and expanded on Part 1 to fill it up more? Nevertheless - I'll eventually pick it up in paperback along with my Kindle edition because I just love this series.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|IT'S AMAZING. DOWN TO EARTH.THE CHARACTERS ARE BELIEVEABLE. THE SETTING IS AWESOME A REALLY GOOD LITERATURE PIECE.I NTERESTING TO ANALYSE. SMOOTHLY READABLE. AMUSING.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|My wife and I vacationed in Cannes and Pais this summer.  The various places visited in the book were very much like revisiting the places that we visited.  Also, the French language used in the book was fun to interpret before the author's translation.  The author's depiction of French/American relationships was well done.  For those contemplating a trip from Cannes to Paris on the high speed train, plan on a five hour not two hour trip.  All in all a fun read.
B00E6F155E|4.0|Peter Gabriel fans will love this Blu-ray release. The 1987 concert, Live in Athens, is finally available on Blu-ray. There is also a DVD included with 23 music videos. The picture quality is great and the audio quality is superb. The audio has been remastered so it sounds like you are listening to the studio versions of the songs instead of actually being there. That may not please some purists but the vocals are crystal clear and improve the experience for the Blu-ray buyer.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: \\"1080p\\"/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1<br />Audio Formats: English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English: LPCM 2.0<br />Subtitles/Captions: None.<br />Special Features: 'Play the Videos' DVD, 1986 Peter Gabriel Interview With Paul Gambaccini, Sledgehammer Music Video, Booklet<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray. Overall, it is a worthwhile upgrade for fans who have purchased a previous release.
0399229191|5.0|My 2 year old daughter loves this book. It has a texture of the spider's web, which my daughter loves to touch.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|This a great cartoon Star War. Sad that Disney does not like the series and wants to do away. It a first rated Star War.
0316322407|5.0|The writing has a fresh, young, energetic, feeling from page to page.  I have heard her talk on TV/Internet and there is a feeling that she is talking to me personally.  This gives it a feeling for total truth, honesty about her exceptional life and personality.  I enjoyed the feeling of being given a very personal look into the culture of that part of the world.  Our press gives a one dimensional view in short sound bytes.  Malala gives a more complete first hand accounting of the forces that hold her culture together, shows the strengths and dynamic forces that are in play day to day.  She has lifted many layers of ignorance and filled me with a personal understanding for her and her peoples life dynamics.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Disappointing.  Kite Runner was an amazing novel by Hosseini, but &#34;And The Mountains Echoed&#34; doesn't compare.  Novel had a great start: compelling story and wonderful writing as in Kite Runner.  But novel became disjointed and lacked flow.  Cohesion of story became forced and a bit artificial.  Characters introduced only to disappear without explanation.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Excellent, so easy to use.  So easy to read (old eyes).  Really looked for a basic calculator f o r everyday use, this fit the bill.  Love the continuing tape feature.  I will certainly recommend it to my friends.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I am still trying to figure out its application, what can I cast to my TV, from where can it be cast, etc.
0399255370|2.0|I'm not sure what others find so charming in this new picture book.  The crayons are whiney, entitled little brats who all have something about their work they feel the need to complain about except for the green crayon who just complains that yellow and orange are driving him crazy.  Yellow and orange crayon are demanding and obnoxious and resort to name calling.  Blue is complaining because he's the favorite and has been used so much that now he's stubby.<br /><br />The tone and content of this book sort of set my teeth on edge.  It's the kind of annoying \\"it's not fair\\" lament that prompts the response \\"life's not fair\\" or the whining cry that in the olden days would have earned a \\"quit your crying or I'll give you something to cry about\\".<br /><br />Call me an old crabby pants but I'm not feelin' it with this one.<br />Save your money and borrow it from your local library before you put it on your shopping list.
B006G3CFU8|2.0|Not the best movie, quality was fine...but the movie itself was just not that interesting. Would recommend a better movie.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app would be something that interests me but everytime I try to download for my kindle fire(which this program is supposedly written for) I am met with an error that says it cannot install.  Fell short from the start.  How can I give an honest review if I can't evaluate the app?
0385537131|5.0|Another great story from Grisham! He goes into the underlying story of racism in the South, giving a sense of the reality of current racism.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|Great album by Stonesour, I play it all the time and still do not get sick of hearing it over again!
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Have not really played it that much so this not a great review..To be quite fair I was confused slightly
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I enjoyed playing this on facebook and now I'm very happy to be able to play this on my kindle!
B000002VSN|1.0|Sadly we played this one and it started to skip  Rather than make a stink we decided to never shop with seller again
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was so good all the twist and turns Christian's revelation changing him into the exact man Ana wanted him to be what a love story.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I find this game very entertaining. I enjoy receiving and sending free gifts with my fb friends. However, I am not able to collect enough bingo credits to enable me to play as much as I would like to. This is why I did not give a five star rating.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Excellent Fun and great online game experience. I highly recommended this app for someone who loves pool. Exciting when u win and heartbreaking if u lose!
B008RF0M9O|5.0|These are perfect replacement earpads for my SONY MDR-7506 headphones! Saved me $80 by purchasing new pads instead of new cans. Thanks!
031625178X|5.0|A powerful message which our grown son was able to receive, so much so, he passed it on to another young man who was in need of hearing the message.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Totally unique style. Keeps you riveted to the story and the characters. Narrative style and insertion of bold &#34;ad libs&#34; is a fascinating idea. Recommend this book to everyone, young and old. My concern is that I just discovered the book when the movie was released.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|A bit different from his other CD's, but his voice shines, and the lyrics to the songs are very thought provoking...another winner, James!
B00AOEA22I|4.0|While not quite as magical as their fantastic debut, the much anticipated follow up from this AOR powerhouse super group does not disappoint. Jeff Scott Soto's golden voice once again dominates this mix of catchy and melodic mid tempo rockers and ballads and captivates the listener in a way few singers in this era are able to accomplish. As with the debut, the songs here are well crafted, the melodies easy to sing along with and the riffs keep the head bobbin along to thunderous beats. Hard to pick highlights here as the recording is so consistently good from start to finish, but \\"Learn To Live Again\\" - with the lead guitar hook and huge chorus harmonies - is such a great rock anthem; and \\"Love Heals\\" is easily the quintessential \\"rule the radio\\" rock ballad. In this day of quick release mp3 tracks where so much of the music is processed and devoid of passion or melody it is nice to have these guys putting out high quality recordings filled with enjoyable melodic hits for those of us older rockers that appreciate music you can still crank up and sing out with while cruising down the road.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Of course I wanted to finish reading this before the movie came out and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />The second book has a lot more character development and continues perfectly from the first book. If you liked the first book or even movie, you'll definitely enjoy this book. I usually don't read at ALL but The Hunger Games series has always kept me intrigued. Definitely check this book out! Well worth the time.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I have been searching for a calculator to assist me in precalculus but no matter what I would always find something to complain about. I love this app and it has really helped me with my homework. I hope everyone enjoys this app, it's incredibly simple and almost always get what you write correct. sometimes it may put odd things but that is mainly due to illegible handwriting.
0061537934|5.0|Anyone who loves dogs (and you know who you are) will have tears when they read this book, and then will buy two more copies to give to their dog loving friends.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|I bought this to go in the stairway leading to the basement.  I used the Velcro provided so I wouldn't put another hole in the wall.  It didn't stick properly and the light crashed down.  It survived but the switch to turn it off, auto, or on is broken.  I had it on auto (which is what I wanted) so at least it's stuck on that and not off or on making the light useless.  So word of advice, if you are going to use the sticky Velcro provided, put a cushion under it until you know for certain it's not going to fall.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham at his best. Several years after his success in A Time To Kill, Grisham takes us back to small-town attorney Jack Brigance in Clanton MS, with a tale of greed versus morality. Could not put this one down!
B00C1040TO|5.0|Very well done and has a lot of features. The tuner is also accurate and has a nice way of showing whether you are in tune or not.
1594487154|5.0|I am a fan of Daniel Pink, and he has reinforced my confidence in his work with this book.<br /><br />As a life-long sales person, I have always maintained that &#34;everyone is in sales.&#34;  The problem has been the skewed view of &#34;selling&#34; that most people have.  Pink has put together a description of selling using various research results to help us understand what sales is really about.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is contemplating a selling career, who buys from sales people, who manages sales people, or who just wants to gain insights to make you more successful in your life.
1442359315|5.0|Fascinating near death experience. Well written, Engaging. Made more interesting because it is written by a neurosurgeon. Engaging speaker too.
B002M9WW30|5.0|What needs to be said?  It's one of the greatest movie sagas of all time in one Blu-ray collection.  Long live Rocky Balboa!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Having lots of fun. So glad they came out with this version!  It is easier then the online version, and it lets you go get through quests without so many hard t things to do.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Though pundits questioned the amount of violence in this movie, it is an original take on the Superman origin story that stretches the character a bit more than we've become accustomed to.  Giving Clark the burden of being a stranger in a strange land is something that we've never seen any of the other Superman movies address.  There are other subtle differences from the traditional story that work very well.  Plus, who doesn't want to see Superman kick serious tail?  We don't watch superhero movies for the drama - we want action, and Man of Steel most definitely delivers in that area.
B00005B1W5|5.0|This had very rich sound and great photography. Unlike many others, we found this better than Yanni's Live At The Acropolis.
0060775858|5.0|This is my son's favorite book! My son is 2 and he loves to find all the pieces on the page after he reads each sentence. It's a must in your child's book collection.
6305781427|4.0|This was great. Based on some other reviews, I thought it would be better than the Yanni's Tribute. Not in my opinion.
0316322407|5.0|This was a very good investment because this little girl is someone all girls can look up to. She has been through so much and still stands tall. This will book will bring tears to your eyes. Well worth the price.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My daughters of 3 and 5 love this sticker pad. Very creative and easy for those little fingers. Nice entertainment.
0062073567|4.0|Wonderful Agatha Christie book: Small town murder w/ a twist at the end... As much as I love 'Dame Agatha' and (almost) all her mystery books, this one isn't quite as good as Sleeping Murder or And Then There Were None (aka Ten Little Indians), but it's close... Here, Hercule Poirot retires to the country and settles in tending to his garden of vegetable marrows when - thump - he's in the middle of a murder mystery.<br /><br />Agatha is a great mystery writer.  However, I think that Agatha Christie's greatest gift as a writer is conveying to the reader the very real sense of small town England in the 1920's, 1930's and beyond.
1612183956|4.0|Excellent book. well written and very engrossing, I Highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a thriller to read.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Comical and fun. Enjoyed it.<br />Good developer. We will enjoy many other titles from them. Theme based games are a blast.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|I am using it on Kindle Fire now, but it is not very sensitive when I touch it. However, I am going to purchase an Ipad to see if it gets better because the Ipad has better processor and display.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game it is awesome it is the best game REAL STEAL IS AWSOM AND ITS $0.99 and could be free
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am hooked on this game as are many of my friends. It's a great way to kill time. I have tried to rate some of the things I bought through Amazon. How ever this is a pain in the butt survey and I doubt many people will take the time you require.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I've been practicing the law of attraction for many years, yet it's not easy to practice.  The author breaks it down in a matter of fact way that makes it doable.  And low and behold it works.....when it came to the exercise with asking for a specific item to wish for.... my bike had been stolen, so I said ok I want a new one.....free or under $50.  Went out combing thrift store and yard sales....looking....nothing!  I did NOT tell anyone of the experiment....final day Monday morning, weekend over, heading into work with 2 hours to go before the deadline my mother calls.. and says I want to buy you a new bike as an early birthday gift....(over a month early)I was speechless.  It works.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|It is hard to set a alarm and it doesn't have a snooze function to play your favorite music.Later it didn't work at all
B003O86FMW|5.0|Any young adult book without zombies and vampires is a good thing.  But one which is basically a political thriller really makes for good adult reading.  Begins a little slowly...but second half is great.,..
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game to play if you are looking for a game that has monsters in it. You can also log in to Facebook in it.
B006T3RM08|1.0|it won't lay flat. It's like a chair someone sawed one leg 3 inches short. Super annoying and I'll be throwing it in the recycling bin.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|great book...very very interesting and sad at the same time. I would recommend anyone to read this book reality is reality
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|my grandson is autistic and he goes on Amazon and makes his wish list for birthday and Christmas every year. You have not let me down yet. They came in time and in excellent condition and the smile on his face was worth a million dollars. Thank You.

B00DF0POXA|1.0|This album is pure S*** - There is no Sh-t worse than this guy- Racist, idiot- Narcissist- So full of  himself
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great and as advertised when plugged directly into the HDMI port on our TV. However, when I tried to &#34;permanently&#34; install using an A/B switch to choose between Chromecast and normal cable feed, it would not work. I don't know if this problem lies with  Chromecast or in the A/B switch I chose. Bottom line: Chromecast works well when used precisely as directed.
0316322407|5.0|inspiring. cultural change will come from the women of the world and she is off to a good start. be patient, Malala, it will take several generations. It was only 90 years ago that women were permitted to vote in the United States....
1932100660|4.0|This book was life-changing for me. It makes a bullet-proof case for maintaining a plant-based diet for good health. I've been on a plant-based diet (eating meat only occasionally) for three years and have never felt better. I'm a believer.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Huge fan of the series, so having a piece of the show - replicated or not - is awesome.  A must have for TWD collectors.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Makes some really good points. Yes our health care system needs a redo and better choices. I just don't think I want those choices in big governments hands. I want to be in controll of my health care choice. No to Socialism, but YES to a new, non-governmental system!!
B008JFUO72|3.0|GOOD MOVIE, BUT I  STILL LIKE IRON MAN 1. THE BEST.I ENJOY OWNING THE SET, AND LIKE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.
B003TJR2HS|2.0|The device works great, but then the Micro-USB connector broke off after a month of use, which indicates pretty serious quality issue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awesome not just that but you can update it to the holiday or weather youre in. You should get it. In my opinion because it is nice, fun, and FREE! I think it us pretty nice. I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS &lt;3
B00C1040TO|1.0|Too bad it doesn't play any sound on the kindle fire, not the generator or the metronome.<br /><br />Fix and I'll reconsider.
B00G32OMF8|2.0|Someone stated Ethan Hawk was annoying and I couldn,t agree more. However to me Julie Delpy was truly annoying and a irritation. First off, I adore BEFORE SUNRISE and I love BEFORE SUNSET! I own both dvds.  I did not like comments made by her. Example: she states \\"who would want to be Joan of Arc? She was a virgin and died burning at the stake.\\" I was surprised that comment was made by a French citizen knowing Joan is the Patron Saint of France. Was it necessary to tell us how her Mother would kill baby kittens in plastic bags?  The film was insulting and I would never watch it again.
B00181MHQU|4.0|Rented this for my 11 year old granddaughter.  She loved it.  Just a classic.  As much as this musical is presented in schools, etc., it is good for young people to see the original.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a classic game, it's easy to use and a great way to kill time waiting in line to renew your driver 's license.  There are other versions available but this one works great and I don't mind the ads.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of my very favorite reads!  I have told so many others about this book.  Well written and a delight to read.
0670024856|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. I love historical fiction. I also really enjoyed the subject of botany. A subject that I didn't pay enough attention to while in school, but fascinates me now because I'm older, wiser and I do see God's signature in each living thing. Also, I nearly fell off my reading chair when the subject of mosses came up...I mean other than a bryologist, I thought I was the only person to see a whole tiny universe inside a beautiful patch of moss! lol<br /><br />As for the characters...well...not one of them is lovable. I wanted to love Alma, I really did, but I could not and this leads me to my beef with this book.....<br /><br />Why do authors feel they have to include sex to sell a book!?! If the subject is interesting enough and the characters are likable...you really, really don't have to &#34;sex it up.&#34; I understood Alma exploring her &#34;quim&#34; once, but the repeated reference to it was unnecessary (plus, I hate the word &#34;quim&#34;). I found myself saying, &#34;not the binding closet again!&#34; I am not even close to being a prude, but this subplot throughout the whole book was so unnecessary and subtracted from a five-star rating for me. As &#34;they&#34; say, &#34;sex sells&#34;, but I could have done without it in this otherwise well written, albeit long, historical fiction novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series of books s<br />Was very interesting<br />I know it keep my interest and also everyone around me was reading so I decided I needed to<br />I love it<br />Thanks a lot a very good read
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|The trailers for this film made me a skeptic but, I watched Planes for the first time from a Redbox rental last night while my kids were in bed and while I was recovering from my root canal, done earlier in the day.  I had so-so likings for Disney's Planes.  I did not like how Dusty was too similar to the Owen Wilson voiced Lightning McQueen character and I did not like how Skipper was too similar to the Paul Newman voiced Doc Hudson character.<br /><br />Today my 12-year-old son watched Planes with his 9-year-old sister.  The enthusiasm barometer from my kids was way up, while watching Planes, compared to their first viewings of Cars and Cars 2.  I guess all those times I took my kids to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, cultivated their aviation enthusiasm and they were ripe for watching Disney's Planes, today.<br /><br />My son got teary-eyed when Skipper recounted his painful battle experience in War 2.  My son also got teary-eyed when the other racing planes started donating replacement parts to Dusty.<br /><br />Watching the movie with two kids that were loving it made me enjoy it more.  Then, the DVD's Special Features won my heart over with a section about the great vintage war birds, including the P-51D Mustang.<br /><br />So, today, I ordered Disney's Planes (Blu-ray/DVD, 2013, 2-Disc Set, Including Digital Copy).<br /><br />This film and special features cultivates my existing love for aviation.  I would have liked to seen more expensive high-powered actors doing the principal roles in this movie but I respect Disney/Pixar's choice to cut production costs since aviation movies don't do all that great at the box office.  Planes was not a block buster but, it did produce a respectable profit to cost ratio.  It's worth seeing for the first time.  I suggest renting it before deciding to buy it.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|A really good book a lot good ideas to follow<br />Thanks for this book and it's guidance<br />Thanks a lot

B000LX00RY|5.0|This is really one of the best movies of all time.  It is very entertaining and definitely a feel-good movie.  I am also always surprised to learn that men also enjoy the movie.  Definitely watch it if you haven't seen it.  I am watching it for the fifth or sixth time and still enjoy it as much as when I first saw it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very intriguing book it sure did keep my interest lol<br />I love reading it<br />I wasn't going to read these books but everyone around was reading them and talking about them so I did get them<br />Love them
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Enjoy this game but I also enjoy hunting real game as well. Doesn't take long to finish a hunt. Wished you could compile and save money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't going to read these books<br />But everyone around me was reading and talking about them<br />So I decided to get them<br />Loved them I really enjoyed the read and the romance of it
B000HF0J36|1.0|Terrible script, terrible special effects, and the worse actors I have had the displeasure to watch.  Skip it unless you are looking for a movie to put you to sleep
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Love all these series of books<br />I love the guidance that they have<br />Thanks so much for them<br />Very helpful thanks a lot
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love this series.  If you think its just about the zombies you are missing out.  This is really a great character study about how normal people have to change in order to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.  The actors chosen for this series are outstanding and really make a good script a great show to watch!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I had to read this book for the book club I was in<br />But I did enjoy reading in very much<br />Very intriguing book keep my interest<br />Thanks so much
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just wow! For all the excitement that I had for reading the installment, I had a bitter taste in my mouth upon completion. Not just the ending did it for me, which is atrocious at best, but also the fact that it took me over a week to finish it because I was bored to the point of no return. I was constantly confused with the switchback between Tris and Four because they sound exactly the same. This made me back track a lot of the time to remember who exactly was speaking. I think Roth may have been having a bit of an identity crisis while writing this book. She forgot that she was writing a YA series and not a philosophy novel. While I appreciate the effort at making a book worth substance that I holds a real message, this was just an epic fail...
B003O86FMW|5.0|My daughter wanted my to read this series of books I wasn't going to<br />I really glad I did very intriguing I really did love them and talking with her about them<br /> I then went watch the movie<br />Can't wait to see new movie out<br />Loved it

B009KS4XRO|3.0|Won't let you complete any of the levels unless you play from Facebook. Enjoy the game play just not having to play from Facebook to progress.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great great show.  Love the styling, the acting, the script.  Can't believe I just discovered this show!  Watched the entire first season in a week.  Can't wait for the rest
0575024119|5.0|These happen to be my favorite novels of Daphne du Maurier, so could not resist having them all in one volume. What a writer she was!
B00B6QXN56|1.0|Spent 40 on music this morning.<br />There's no stopping.<br />A Miles vinyl...180 gram<br />Vol 5 Klaus Schultz<br />I'm an ass.<br /><br />Had some really hard conversations yesterday.<br />My bosses were talking about music with me.<br />Like everyone knows the same music.

He said he killed it so hard he had to bring his family into the room and sit them down to watch the slaughter of his strings.  And I'm like what is going on...You brought ur family to see that....Son.  Look at this.  That is how you play guitar.....Son.  Son.  Some Day You Will be a man.<br />I've seen this dude play before and I was amazed at how weak it is.<br />Like what....do something bro.<br />Rip it up.<br />This dude is terrible.<br />Terrible bros.....
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Useful if you use youtube or netflix. Cannot cast from mobile browsers, only from destop. Startup is quick, with only one crash in a month. Picture quality is great.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Loved the 6 Star Trek movies and have waited a long time for the Blu-Ray version to come out. My video library  is happy now.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|One of the best racing apps there is for free I would thought u would pay at lest 9.99  for something this good I recommend it to anyone u loves racing games even if u don't u should still give it a try I mean way not it's free u got nothing to losse
B0015NORBE|5.0|This is one of my favorite Velvet Underground albums, so I bought it on vinyl & it sounds great. No skipping either. Another new record I got the same day skipped all the way through, so I appreciate the ones that don't. Glad I bought it.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|A real ninety caliber. You know, the kind of stuff that needs to get dead? You get it dead. Do it.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Love this historical fiction! It's a read you can't put down. It makes you want to research this history of these families
B000ZMVAXO|4.0|This little item is so handy.  I can take my guitar to school and plug in to practice while waiting for class.  The only down side is if your sitting down to practice (which normally I don't do, unless I'm practicing classical guitar, *duh*) and even after trying this with a better pair of headphones it's a little tinny sounding.  Overall, I'm really happy with it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Finally I read the final book of the Divergent trilogy, Allegiant. What I thought? I'm still digesting it. I really like it, I just never thought that's how it was going to end. After finishing I only have a question on mind: That this just not happen? But after thinking it through , it all made sense. It is the perfect ending, it really got me thinking about life. It was such an emotional, heartbreaking but I that same time heartwarming story. I wasn't disappointed at all. I know many people didn't like the ending, but it's how the character and the story stays true to itself. I love it. Veronica Roth is a talented writer. I'm glad I read the trilogy. I'm looking forward to read more books by her. 5 That did not happen but love it anyways Stars
B004LROMSO|5.0|I liked it, and I like Jamie Bower Campbell. I wish there was a other season of it, to see what happen next.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Got this game for my 7 year old to play. She has been having a blast.  She enjoys playing this game. It is fast paced, not too difficult and she enjoys beating her previous score. Overall, good game.
B000M341QE|5.0|This is a well done film on the Mafia with Great acting by all the actors and a very good story . It has some surprise endings for me at least, The film is very well made and worthy to rent or buy for your collection.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Since she wowed the world in her Britain's Got Talent debut in 2009 Susan Boyle has produced one great album after another. This, her second Christmas album continues her parade of hits.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|If you like Horror movies and Classic cars you will like this movie, But you will not like the ending  I did not.  Though the movie is excellent about a teenager in Love with his 1958 Plymouth Fury which he restores himself with some help. Later getting revenge from being bullied in school  and other bad people in society . I do not know about other viewers but I cheered Christine on and theTeenage driver, since I understand what he went through . One of John Carpenters best movies.
B00FGEAGRM|1.0|I understand this is an edited/clean version and for sure explicit words wouldn't be here, but why censor words like &#34;killed&#34;, &#34;touched&#34; and &#34;sex&#34;, for example? A lot of songs look terrible in this edition of ARTPOP. I don't recommend anyone buying it - BUY THE EXPLICIT VERSION! Much better and you will hear your favorite songs the way they were made!
B00164EAC8|4.0|This movie is either you like it or you do not , I like the Monster Godzilla in this movie and I actually cheer Godzilla to win over the people in New York . So I did not like the ending of the movie  though it is well done for what it is . I did not care for many of the actors  but the film overall is very good for a Sci-fi movie  which there are not many these days worthwhile to watch or own but I feel Godzilla is worthwhile for anyones Sci-fi collection.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really like this game. It's easy to play and moves along really well.<br />It works great with Kindle Fire. Have not had any issues with it.
0394818237|5.0|This book is a classic. Also, a preferred choice (to this parent) than RS's similarly-sized &#34;Cars and Trucks and Things that Go,&#34; as there are sectioned stories, so you can take breaks and not feel obligated to read the whole book in one sitting.  My 4 year old son loves hearing about how everyday things are made, and loves all the tiny details in the books - he will often pore over the illustrations independently, too.  2 years later, this book is still in regular rotation.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|So im a huge fan of this genre, but this game is great and possibly one of the best. The puzzles are challenging ( and sometime difficult ), the HOG games are fewer than others but just enough. And the length of the game is well worth the price and time you will spend on it. A ++++
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Entertaining for the most part so I guess I suggest it. If you like these sorry of games of course but don't play if you can't remember to get on
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story line in the book was riviting and kept me entertained from the first page to the last.<br />Would highly recommend it to any adult age or gender.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I bought a spatula in a kitchen shop. I thought the idea was so clever, I ordered the whole set. I am quite impressed! They seem sturdy for a plastic type utensil. I love that the spoons never touch the counter. I also ordered the utensil holder to keep them more organized than my usual throw everything in the drawer. It works out perfectly. I'm glad I found them.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Terrific movie!  An event which created this movie was tragic.  This was a terrific ending to see that he was finally deceased.  It also tells other terrorists that we will eventually get you!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This would be great except for missing features and the constant push for the paid upgrade.  No frills. No other problems.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The stories were so good and very vivid. The author is very descriptive and it's almost like watching a movie. I thought it was such an interesting book with many characters lives intertwined. It's not a book you could read with distractions as it changes very quickly between characters and you have to pay close attention.  Loved the book and would recommend!
B0045XICB2|4.0|I enjoy the entire Twilight Saga, especially the fight scenes.  The final two movies in the series were the absolute best.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Of course, the episodes are available in existing DVD releases, plus the last half of final Season Five to come out on DVD in late Nov 2013. But I assume the &#34;Complete Series&#34; materials, such as the documentary, will not be included with that &#34;season 5 part 2&#34; DVD release. Anyone know if a *DVD* release is planned of &#34;Breaking Bad: The Complete Series&#34;?
B007FLHW3K|5.0|This is an excellent wheel light.  The balance is near perfect, and the lights are very bright and colorful.  Installation takes about 10 minutes.  As a former Hokey Spoke user, the only feature lacking is an auto-syncing feature the aligns the patterns between the wheels.  But you can fix the pattern and color.    The mounting is via zip ties is quick and doesn't stress the spokes.    I have two of these one on my recumbent's 20\\" front wheel and the other on my upright's 700 wheel it fits perfectly for both.  The website shows them installing a Monkeylight on a 16\\" wheel!  It turns out you can snap the long tab off the lights to allow it to fit the smaller wheel.  I was not required to do that for my 20\\" wheel.      I have been banging around the streets of Boston for a year now, both function perfectly, and battery life is very good.  After using them all winter last year (with 30 minute night commutes), I had to flip mine on last night, the batteries where still good and bright as ever.  The cartridge that holds the battery is easily accessible, and allows for easy changing of the batteries.
0440217563|5.0|Its a good read. Long but worth the read. I thought I would be tired of the story by now but still looking forward to the next book
1451695195|2.0|Although Dr. Alexander's experience did give him insights that an afterlife does exist and that this realm is complex beyond human comprehension, that he oscillated between the \\"earthworm,\\" the \\"Core\\" and \\"Gateway\\" states, and that he was able to report such complexities while he was essentially \\"brain dead\\" is remarkable.<br />Dr. Alexander referred to the Creator as being personal, and the importance prayer played in his recovery yet the book concentrates on his career, his family and the experience rather than a search for meaning beyond this experience.<br />Recognizing that there is a vibrant afterlife, how does or should this knowledge influence our earthly existence, our relationship to the Creator and our search for the ultimate Truth?  His experience is merely a taste of eternity.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|Oh my God it is amazing! I love the way you can roam as though it were a real life game and how it seems to be like each fight has a meaning. Great game all around.
1781162646|5.0|The murder mystery is secondary in the story to me, even though it is brought up from beginning to the end, but it does not take away for this flashback to the past. It is a colorful description of a young man's life, his many first times and the lost of a life (I'm trying not to give anything away) a must read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Many books and other products.  I like it.  My plan is to buy the Kindle Fire HDX for Christmas to myself.  And the Amazon Prime.
1250038820|5.0|A piece of history belongs to me. Love love love this book and Brandon's daily posts. Gives the big apple a softer heart and soul.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best hunting game I've ever played on a tablet graphics and gameplay very good highly recommended for everyone of all ages
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I almost didn't get this but I'm so glad I gave it a chance. The story was beautifully written with \\"death\\"as the narrator which made it even more interesting. Great story with a lot of depth about a very dark time in history.
B0098460O4|5.0|Fantastic singing by two very nice people.They sing beautifully together. I really liked the songs that were picked. I hope they have many more C.D.s.Of course I will buy them! I spend time listening to them while I have my morning coffee. Then have to listen to them again while doing my work.They have amazing talent.I am sure people would like to see a copy in their Christmas present!
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesomeness! This series was completely awesome! Loved them! I hope she writes more books like these! Now to find something good to read.....
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Really like these singers! I will follow their progress as singers . That means I will be buying more C.D.s  of them as they make more C,D,s. I was pleased that I could buy them from Amazon. It is more convenient to order C.D.s and books from Amazon, as I dont have to rush around trying to find them in stores.Also they come right to my door! Marie
1250038820|5.0|The most fabulous book I've ever bought.  The street portraits by Brandon Stanton are the best.  Eagerly awaiting a &#34;Susie the Dog&#34; book.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A good read. Boring writing style, riveting plot. (But flagged a bit in the middle...) Dave Eggers has mashed together many iconic images of the current incarnation of Silicon Valley, and its movers: Facebook, Google, Amazon, the NSA ... The large lives of David Cameron & Larry Ellison. Interesting issues. It will be food to mull over, to discuss. Enough for now. I want more time to digest before composing a considered review.
B000SINT52|5.0|This will always be one of my top 5 documentaries of all time.  Michael Moore has an ability to make shows not only full of information but always entertaining with alot of tounge in cheek humor....I think this is probably Moores Jewel in the Crown when it comes to his documentaries. I think Sicko was a close second..
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|Beware, this particular cable is NOT MFI certified.  Repeated error messages and will not charge when using with an iOS7 device.
B000EZ7ZYA|5.0|It's brand new as promised wrapped in its plastic, no glitches, super cheap. For a Blu-ray this is a steal
0061438294|5.0|The book was great.  I bought it for my son whose sick.  Lots of waiting rooms and doctors visits at the mayo clinic so it helpped to pass the time.  I love amazon and the products they provide.
1408215330|4.0|Exellent price and quality than I expected. Now I am using it happily ,so I recommanded it to my neighbors happily
1878424319|5.0|You will love this simple book with a profound message. Weigh every word and absorb it, it will change your life!

B008B68IUY|5.0|Bought for my granddaughter's birthday.  She was thrilled.  It was larger than I thought.  Glad I got it for her.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|AWESOME game great graphics idealistic game for down time and I have lots of it so I'm gonna  keep on playing !
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I've lived with it for a while now, and I hardly take it off. It is a real pleasure. If you've never owned a tick tick, start here. The jubilee bracelet is very comfy and apparently very tough.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is a fun game, but you run out of coins too quickly...and you have to keep your prizes or you'll never level up...and you earn more by logging off rather than being online...
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Got this for my fiancee as she loves these shows. It was pretty good, much better than the first in my opinion. Had many twists and turns throughout the story. Rather sad ending I thought.
B008XG1X18|3.0|At first this was a great app...but I lost interest quick...I do enjoy the DIY posts, but I can get those on Facebook as well..
B0014JGDUC|5.0|I have worn these for years, I have walked across ice and not fallen.  They are very comfortable, never stink, and I can be on my feet for hours.  They last about sic  months full time wear, and a year when only worn around the house.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|This is too complicated and it doesn't let you post it to facebook...I think this was a waste of time downloading this to my kindle...
B00AP5NW4G|4.0|This is not a perfect book, but it is unique, and if you skim the first 400 or so pages, the last 300 are a pretty good attempt to apply what's known about behavior to social changes in violence and manners over time. The basic topic is: how does our genetics control and limit social change? Surprisingly he fails to give in any clear way the best current explanation (group selection) developed over the last 8 years by his world famous Harvard colleague E.O Wilson (see his recent book The Social Conquest of Earth). Mostly the criticisms given by others (I read them all) are nit-picking and irrelevant and, as Pinker has said, he could not write a coherent book about &#34;bad things&#34;, nor could he give every possible reference and point of view, but he should have said at least something about the other ways of abusing and exploiting people and the planet since these are now so much more severe as to render other forms of violence irrelevant.<br /><br />Extending the concept of violence will provide a very different perspective on what is happening in the world right now and how things are likely to go in the next few hundred years. One might start by noting that the decrease in physical violence over history has been matched (and made possible) by the constantly increasing merciless rape of the planet (i.e., by people's destruction of their own descendants future). Pinker (like most people most of the time) is often distracted by the superficialities of culture when its biology that matters. Again see Wilson's book for details.<br /><br />This is the classic nature/nurture issue and nature trumps nurture --infinitely. What really matters is the violence done to the earth by the relentless increase in population and resource destruction (due to medicine and technology) About 200,000 more people a day (another Las Vegas every 3 days, another Los Angeles every three weeks), the 12 tons or so of topsoil going into the sea/person/year etc. mean that unless some miracle happens the biosphere and civilization will largely collapse in this century and there will be starvation, misery and violence of every kind on a staggering scale. People's manners, opinions and tendencies to commit violent acts are of no relevance unless they can do something to avoid this catastrophe, and I don't see how that is going to happen. There is no space for arguments, and probably no point either (yes I'm fatalist), so I'll just make a few comments as though they were facts. Don't imagine I have a personal stake. I am 71, have no descendants and no close relatives and do not identify with any political, national or religious group and regard the ones I belong to by default as just as repulsive as all the rest.<br /><br />Parents are all Enemies of Life on Earth and women are at least as violent as men. The fact that women's violence (like most of that done by men) is largely done in slow motion, at a distance in time and space and mostly carried out by proxy -by their descendants and by men --does not ameliorate it. Increasingly women bear children regardless of whether they have a mate and the effect of stopping one woman from breeding is on average much greater than stopping one man. In my view most people and their offspring richly deserve whatever misery comes their way and (with rare exceptions) the rich and famous are the worst offenders. Meryl Streep or Bill Gates and each of their kids may destroy 50 tons of topsoil each per year, while an Indian farmer may destroy 1 ton. If you deny it or don't want to deal with it that's fine, and to your descendants I say &#34;Welcome to Hell on Earth&#34;(WTHOE).<br /><br />Human Responsibilities must replace Human Rights. Nobody gets rights without being a responsible citizen and the first thing this means is minimal environmental destruction . The most basic responsibility is no children unless your society asks you to produce them. A society or a world that lets people breed at will and supports their progeny will always be exploited by selfish genes until it collapses (or reaches a point where life is so horrific it's not worth living). If you want to maintain Human Rights as primary, that's fine and to your descendants one can say with confidence &#34;WTHOE&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Helping&#34; has to be seen from a global long term perspective. Almost all &#34;help&#34; that's given by individuals, organizations or countries harms others and the world in the long run and must only be given after a very careful consideration. If you want to hand out money, food, medicine, etc., you need to ask what the long term environmental consequences are. If you want to please everyone all the time, that's fine and again to your descendants I say &#34;WTHOE&#34;.<br /><br />Dysgenics: endless trillions of creatures beginning with bacteria-like forms over 3 billion years ago have died to create us and all current life and this is called eugenics. We all have &#34;bad genes&#34; but some are worse than others. It is estimated that up to 50% of all human conceptions end in spontaneous abortion due to &#34;bad genes&#34;. Civilization is dysgenic. This problem is currently trivial compared to overpopulation but getting worse by the day. Medicine, welfare and &#34;helping&#34; of all kinds have dysgenic consequences which will collapse society even if population growth stops. Again if you don't believe it or don't want to deal with it that's fine and to your descendants we can say &#34; WTHOE&#34;.<br /><br />Beware the utopian scenarios that suggest doomsday can be avoided by judicious application of technologies. You can't fool mother nature. I leave you with just one example. Famous scientist Raymond Kurzweil proposed nanobots as the saviors of humankind. They would make anything we needed and clean every mess. They would even make ever better versions of themselves. They would keep us as pets. But think of how many people treat their pets, and pets are overpopulating and destroying and becoming dysgenic almost as fast as humans. Pets only exist because we destroy the earth to feed them and we have spay and neuter clinics and euthanize the sick and unwanted ones. We practice rigorous population control and eugenics on them and no form of life can evolve or exist without these—not even bots. And what's to stop nanobots from evolving? Any change that facilitated reproduction would automatically be selected for and any behavior that wasted time or energy (i.e., taking care of humans) would be heavily selected against. What would stop the bots program from mutating into a homicidal form and exploiting all earth's resources causing global collapse? There is no free lunch for bots either and to the them too we can confidently say &#34;WTHOE&#34;.geny will always be exploited by selfish genes until it collapses (or reaches a point where life is so horrific it's not worth living). If you want to maintain Human Rights as primary, that's fine and to your descendants one can say with confidence &#34;WTHOE&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Helping&#34; has to be seen from a global long term perspective.

We practice rigorous population control and eugenics on them and no form of life can evolve or exist without these—not even bots. And what's to stop nanobots from evolving? Any change that facilitated reproduction would automatically be selected for and any behavior that wasted time or energy (i.e., taking care of humans) would be heavily selected against. What would stop the bots program from mutating into a homicidal form and exploiting all earth's resources causing global collapse? There is no free lunch for bots either and to the them too we can confidently say &#34;WTHOE&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a great app it's fun too play but sometimes the loading is a little slow and it glitches, but other than that I love it
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait to recommend it to my 13 year old granddaughter!  It is thought provoking on so many levels without getting bogged down in too much stuff.  Will make for good discussions with your teens.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I think it is a grate game to play because it has a Ways to go on it gives me something to do
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This movie is so  so  so  so  funny.  I first saw it at the Traverse City film fest ....  Yet it never had a wide release.
B00GFOIUVQ|1.0|Graphics are cool, but not worth the time and space. The controls suck. For instance it tells you to tap to fingers to throw his hammer, however, he throws it even when you tap once to attack a target one foot from you. If they fix the controls it would be a decent game.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I really like this app but the only problem with it is on the stop the blood part. It only lets me stop the blood with two holes. I automatically die and lose a life. If that is fixed I would give it five stars.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Fun game with lots of different scenarios. I'm not a video gammer, but I like this one. Can be addictive.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I found Piper's writing of her prison experience so interesting & enjoyed learning about all her fellow inmates. I couldn't put this book down!! Great read!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I just hated this movie. Could hardly stand to watch it. And I love movies/shows with singing. I'm a Glee fan.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I work different shifts and this app really seems to help me rest better.  Very adjustable to your own taste.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Love the Snugg for my iPhone 5S.  No slip case where the iPhone can accidentially fall out.  I had a Snugg for my iPhone 4S.  I liked that case as well though I did notice that the ends of the case started to fray a bit.  It didn't seem to that big of a problem so I bought one for the 5S
B00FGJNS72|1.0|It doesn't work on my kindle anymore. It won't let download it. I've tried downloading it serval times and won't download. I checked the internet connection and that is working fine.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  The first few pages had me wondering if I was going to like it, but by chapter 2, I was hooked.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fabulous a great read.  I am a huge fan of Stephen King. I have read everything he has written.  Thank you my friend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Then I won't have the pleasure of first-time-reading it ever again. King is a brilliant writer and plotter. His characters are solid and love/hateable.<br /><br />But what can I read now?
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|This was like a reader 's digest version of the movie classic. I quite enjoyed it and found some of the differences from the cinematic take interesting.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great app. Simple, easy to use. Would be great for me if it had a stop watch function as well.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a fun game. It is very helpful in relieving stress. The baby dragons are so cute and it is a joy to play.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love this version of Mahjong! What a perfect focus game and escape for me (stay at home mom of two). I am attracted to games which are pleasing to the eye and this one does not disappoint. The background and tile selections make it for an enjoyable game which translates into huge chunks of play time spent unnoticed! I'm still a novice but I do enjoy this version of all the ones which I have tried. Don't think I'll be purchasing another after this (I've had it since July)!
0345803485|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK! Soon as I began reading it (as it allows you to on amazon to look inside) and from the FIRST LINE i was intrigued because i felt like I was reading my cousin talk. YES! SHE IS ANA STEELE! I of course read her the lines because it seemed so surreal and she herself could not believe it! So of course I had to keep reading and get her to read along with me. So we both read it and LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! for her of course it was like looking in the mirror only minus the whole Christian part but as how E.L James wrote describing Ana and how she spoke and behaved in certain incidents it was like my cousin telling her story. It was too funny yet surreal LOL!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is my son's Christmas gift. The product is excellent, the price is reasonable, and the service is fantastic. I am very satisfied with it. Highly recommend. Thanks.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|Not sure if this should've been a 3 cd album but I like him. He has a unique distinct voice which draws me in. I can relate to some of his songs and well if ur kinky enough this can work in the bedroom too for a little 50 shades role playin ;)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|great time passer. wish there were more than 5lives though. ha ha ha!!!! definitely addictive in a good way! play all the time.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter looks forward to every book. She read this in 1 day. Already have all the other books, up to date with them and has a collection going. Cant wait for the next one & the movies too!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app, gives hourly weather for the day.  Has weekly information as well.  And the radar is always a must for everybody.  Sometimes it is a little slow to get started, but otherwise works great!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Its awesome and they are my favorite boy band. I like all of their projects both solo and as a group.
B00DB624GS|5.0|Excellent disk which stands the test of time, although some cuts are definitely dated to the late sixties.  The added cuts made this a good deal.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I an addicted to this game. I play until I use up my lives and then the waiting begins til it is replenished. Very fun to play and to pass the time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love everything about this game! It's like Temple Run, but cuter! The only thing I don't like is that it is slow to load some features, and it takes awhile to update. Other than that, it's a great game(:
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|This package is excellent if you like the Elm Street Movies. However, Freddie actually emerges from the package, be careful.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|A beautiful view of the universe! This films shows the perfect order and design in creation. Would love to see more!
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Love it. I was their for the second night and every bit of the show was great. You could feel that the performers were also spectators enjoying everything we saw.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I enjoy this series very much.  I'm very happy to have it available on Amazon Prime.  Can't wait until the next season is available to stream.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed when I realized that this book was just like the other two, I was hoping for something new.  I had hoped that the characters would find a world where deception was not the norm and they were not faced with so much conflict........NOPE!!!  I am glad that I read, it is good to have closure.  But, it was not all that I had hoped for.....
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it.  Not to crazy about the ending but I can't comment too much so as to not give it away.  This one kept me guessing which is hard to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|But the only thing I wish what they would do is give you more lives. Also I didn't like having to pay. But, the game is pretty sweet
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the way the writer entertwined the lives of the characters and their stories.  Yes, I found it predictable in some areas, and some of the characters were more likeable or believable than others,  but over all it was well written and I was very glad I purchased it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a good game. It is really fun and awesome to play. I really recomend this game. It never gets boring.
0446310786|5.0|I loved the book and I love the movie,  I wanted to know a little more about the characters is the reason I bought the book
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like to build stuff. This game is well put together.  It is very fun to do!!!  It helps me... have fun.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Charming and fun family movie! Guaranteed to make the whole family laugh!  The minions are adorable, the girls are spunky, and Gru, the villain, is hilariously quirky.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly addictive and strategy oriented.  Very satisfied! The only thing I would change is adding more lives.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Doctor Who is a fabulous series.  It is truly charming, perhaps a wee bit campy...but that is part of its appeal.  It is written as a family show, meant to entertain children and adults alike.  It is about a time travelling alien (Eccleston) and his exploits as he rambles through universe with his friends...how he uses wit and intelligence instead of brute force and violence to overcome the evil plots he stumbles across during his travels.  It is definitely worth a watch, and if you are having a hard time getting into the story...give it through The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, a two part.
0385351399|1.0|Ineptly imagined and amateurishly written.  I kept having the feeling that I'd been tricked into reading a novel by Sidney Sheldon.  The wonder is that Eggers was able to remain interested enough to finish it.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is perhaps the best and most faithful adaption you will ever see of this iconic story.  I love every minute of it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Just started playing this nd so far I love it!  I played the original on Facebook but this is better! I am excited to continue and see where the adventure takes me.
B007G5K066|5.0|This is a great thinking man's movie.  My roommate hated it because it wasn't an action flick.  But if you like a movie that is a compelling story, a mystery, and beautifully acted, then you should enjoy this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome because you can get to play with your horse,feed it and do lots of other stuff.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Seriously, how can one go wrong with Michael Buble?!?  You can't.  His voice is amazing, the arrangements are fantastic!  I love the big band jazzy sound!
B004WR125O|5.0|The best thing about this device is that I can now access many of my favorite XM Radio stations (as well as many other internet radio stations) without the use of an antenna. I used to have a problem with my previous receiver whenever we used the microwave oven because it interrupted the signal.
B008602KQI|1.0|While the movie may have been well done, I wouldn't know because I was disgusted by the children killing children.<br />I was told that the books have more of a message than the first movie portrayed, but I didn't read the book so it doesn't matter!  The storyline is revolting--though of course I disdain the premise of  \\"might making right\\", it wasn't played up in the movie.  The movie was about glorifying violent action and the entertainment of showing children killing is in poor taste even for Hollywood.<br />If I knew what the movie was about, I wouldn't have watched it.  All I knew was that I heard about it and it was part of Amazon Prime!<br />I certainly would never read a book based on this idea.
B0013V8OFI|5.0|This is definitly an old time favorite!! :)  If you haven't seen it yet....but it, dont rent it...it is a good one to add to your movie collection!
B001I45UFC|5.0|I really love this book. It has lots of adventures and battles. It is really great and you should read the book. (Tomas age 5)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The last Olympian and the last few months later on the case time to the case that the son is a few years
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not good as other streaming devices; I think google failed again on streaming device area. I tried google tv it was epic failure and this continues too. Roku actually rocks in streaming videos.
B004RKC4PI|1.0|Big deal.  A cash in.  No new product to push.  Not their best stuff.  For those who weren't around in the 70's and missed thegood stuff.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love everything King does. An excellent read. I am definitely going to re-read this book. But of course I re-read most of King's books.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Aerosmith lost it big time inthe 80's.  Seduced by the corporates and stripped of their gritty style, they have never truly regained the spirit of what they were in their original glory days.  Not a bad record, just nothing specal.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. More than I excepted to. Even though Piper Kaman was not in a major prison, but in a Camp as she called it. The book did convey life of imprisonment, regardless weather in a major prison or a Camp it still a life of No Choice of where you are and who is around you. And how hard it is to leave your life, friends, love one, etc, you are just left behind. Kerman did have a great advantage. Her future husband, all the friends sending books, letters, etc. Most Prisoners do not. Also Keman had a shot sentence.<br />Also this book discusses the injustice of the Current Drug Laws. The United States has an extreme amount of Prisoners today. Something like 23% of your populations. Damn!! Why is 23% of our population in jail.<br />Rehabilitation!? What a joke. We do not have any Rehabilitation in this country. I could say more but just read the book
B007EVQAFC|5.0|A great live recording of Alice from not so long ago, with many favourites, some newer tracks and a couple of surprises.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|It works perfectly in my dark, unlighted closet. It's certainly bright enough for me to pick out clothes, shoes, accessories etc., at 6:00 am without waking my other half early in the morning.  I'm probably going to purchase a few more for other areas of the house that hands-free automatic lighting would be useful, like the basement stairs, the linen closet, and near the water heater/furnace.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Wile not always received in the best manner, the curent line-up has delvered some good usic since Sonic Boom.  Not quite as obvious to re-capture the glory days as Sonic Boom seemed to be doing, but not as satisfying either.  It's ok, Some cringeworthy songs are included, but just another Kiss album really.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|It's one of those movies I watch every Christmas season and love it. Great cast, a little mushy but what can I say...I watch it over and over.
1451620829|3.0|Peter Criss is known to exaggerate, and while his story has it's interesting moments, he'd have you believe he was responsible for Kiss' success more than he really was.  Fun to read, but don't believe all he says.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I read 60 pages and still never made it to the crime scene in the book.  The writer's style is not for me. Bounce all over the place get dizzy just trying to read it. Will never buy one from this author.
0765325950|5.0|I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas present. He really enjoyed it. I can't give specifics about the content, but I can say that my husband is a huge Robert Jordan fan and he thought the book was worthy of the rest.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought this for my wife, she loves J.L.  She won't let me play with her...she say's I'll &#34; ruin &#34; it.  Whatever that means.
B00E6G23TA|5.0|I've found this set to be great. I love the extra additions as well - the 2 orchestrated Intermezzo's are amazing, the first recording of the orchestral version of Liebeslieder Waltzes, the alternate 2nd movement of the first symphony, the extra couple of bars in the beginning of 4th symphony. I do not agree with some of the other reviewers here that Chailly's approach is somewhat convoluted and confused. I believe Chailly knew exactly what he wanted in his set, the interviews epk's for this set show his confidence as well.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. It was very entertaining and challenging. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden object games.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Absolutely the best book in the series!  Thank you Jordan and Sanderson!  Thank you for inspiring and bringing hope to anyone who reads these books!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really love this book. Knowledge and wisdom combined with comedy and physics. A very easy read. Bravo to the author.
B00FLDG42Y|4.0|Great selection of songs.  Geddy sounds better on this one than he does The Time Machine Tour.  Look, the dude is 60 years old; he's just not going to sound like he did 20 years ago.  He sounds fine on the new songs, but that's because his voice has adjusted to them.  Musically, the band sounds great, and the additional strings give a new and creative sound to the new songs and the old as well.  Say what you want about these old guys (and they and the album sure as hell don't deserve a 1-star rating--idiot!), they are still an awesome band and continue to bring great new music.  Many of the other bands from the '70s, '80s and '90s may still be touring, but they don't produce new music, and they are dying a slow death.  Rush is alive and well!
B000P407K4|4.0|It is a dark comedy that takes place during the Cold War with Peter Sellers playing 3 characters.  Peter Sellers is good as always, especially playing Dr. Strangelove.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Best Rocumentary of all time! It makes me want to grab my old boom box, grab my tapes, hit record, and shred.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is so awesome  ummmm  ya yu can time it and and yu can pick your theme for your camera
B00EDX5QNG|5.0|An absolutely amazing album for those who are inclined to listen to deep tracks to listen while driving on the open roads.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It works fine. Gave it 4 because it takes to long to build your army. So you have  to send more time building  then you do in battle.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|movie and Superman 2 you would think that it wouldn't be that hard to do yet they fail at it time after time. The Man of Steel isn't as bad as Superman 3, 4 or Returns however it is also no where as good as the first two movies. There are some parts of the movie I did like though<br /><br />The good<br />I like the new suit that was used for the film it is different from the other films and I think it looks cool.  I like the fact that they explained the S on his costume is a symbol form Krypton and I also like the fact they didn't use thr Superman theme from the other movies it has suffered enough.<br /><br />The bad<br /><br />There is a lot of bad in this movie for example after multiple movies,  animated films, and with the series Smallville we didn't need to see another origin story it was a waste of time and unproductive. Krypton is changed for the film it looks more like Pandora than krypton.  The characters are not developed you never feel for any of them from Clark to Zod you really never care for the character im fact they bore you.  Zod which is an interesting character in the original movies and animated films is just a gnereic super villain nothing special which is a shame since his character has so much more to offer than that.  Instead of showing the impact his Earth parents had on Clark they show little hits of it in flashback I think they should of done that with Krypton instead.  The plot which is weak as it is already disappears half way through the movie for some unknown reason at which point the movie becomes a boring mess that just steals your time don't listen to anyone who says they like the plot it doesn't exist.  The critics where right about the movie so much potential that is wasted.<br /><br />After my 14 year old son and I watched Man of Steel we watched  Superman 2 which even he agreed the Man of Steel was just awful.  If you are looking for a good Superman movie the Man of Steel isn't it Superman and Superman 2 are far superior movies.
006202406X|1.0|After reading first two books which had a good flow with the storyline and enjoyed it very much. However, the third book was a flop. So disappointed there was too much going on that it seems like too many story going on all at one time. Killing off the main character made no sense to me at all. I will read divergent again but will never touch the third book ever.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Good read but HIGHLY predictable. Also had some grammatical errors but not enough to take away from the story. &#34;Safe&#34;is the word that comes to mind.
B000VSAEYI|2.0|I recently set out to purchase my family's christmas on amazon.com. I was extremely excited to get it all done at once and with 3 kids it would have been so easy and super helpful. Unfortunately I got to the end of my shopping venture and had over 150.00 in shipping fees :(. This was unfortunate. So I decided I would join amazon prime. So I paid the 79.00$ fee and away with my order I went. But amazon prime does not cover third party shipping. I was iterated about this. I was trying to spend almost 600.00 on my order and the extra 79.00 I had just spent didnt even touch my shipping charges. So I called.  They put me on hold for over 20 min and hung up on me. So i called again. They put me on hold again for 20 min to tell me there was nothing they could do about it. By the time I had gone back to try and find amazon products to switch out for the third party items some of the items I had chosen were gone completely. How did amazon respond to this? Well they wrote me an email and gave me a 15.00 gift card..... thats right I wanted to spend 600.00 and they thought it would make it all better by giving me 15.00.... haha what a joke to say the least. I felt extreamly insulted.  Amazon made me feel like my problem was not theres and they did not care at all. It made me feel like I was shopping at walmart! So no I dont want your 15.00 you can keep that and give it to someone else.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|You gotta read this!  The start of one of the best fiction series of all time!  Can't wait for more!
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|I have always loved this series and on blu ray it looks even better; the blood looks better and the screams are louder
B00A6RCSKC|3.0|I cannot download this on my Kindle Fire even though i purchased the Kindle Tablet Edition. I have this game on my iPhone and love it. At least it wasn't expensive. :'(
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|A true return to form for Eminem.  I thoroughly enjoyed this album.  As Eminem grows and changes his rhymes strike a chord with my own life experiences and he raps faster in Rap God than I can read the lyrics!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This was a most interesting, thrilling, and entertaining read.  Somewhat complex and difficult to follow due to the foreign setting and names, but OH MY I loved this entire trilogy.  Couldn't put it down.  Definitely these three books should be read in order since they carry through sequentially.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Fantastic reading - I couldn't put the book down.  The old Grishman is back.  It reminded me of his writing A Time To Kill.  Great work.
B00DJWV11I|3.0|I am not giving this book a lower grade the three stars because a lot of my issues with this book are a matter of taste.<br /><br />It is funny. I just don't think its all that romantic. I never really warm up to the hero because he such a man whore, objectifying, jerk.<br /><br />I am really sick of heroes who sleep with everything until they meet the one anyway so being in his head in first person is not going to work out well for me.<br /><br />The BJ scene in the bathroom was not a great moment. He never repents his icky ways but rather just repents his crappy treatment of the heroine.<br /><br />Why would she fall in love with him?
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Wish I had paid attention to the reviews on this one.  Everything that people wrote about it not being up to par where correct.  I don't plan on buying any more of her books until she creates more interesting characters.  We are tried of Kay, Benton, Lucy etc.  Not much more to tell.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I just started to use this game and I think that it has been playing ok so far hope that it will continue to be that way
0061950726|4.0|I really liked it, I am not even sure why I didn't love it.  I love the back and forth between the two stories. It really helped each of the stories getting to see the difference between life then and life now. The writing was good and I will def. look to this author in the future.  I do recommend this book for anyone who likes historical fiction. I honestly never new about orphan trains and although it makes me sad that this happened in our past I felt it was a good idea to write about it and quite interesting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A Fun game, lots of new stuff. Keeps you on your toes can't wait for new stuff to update soon
B000MGATTE|1.0|I picked up this book after reading an interview which Stephen King said this was his best work. After reading 11/22/63 I couldn't wait to read more by him. I was very disappointed, though. I could never make myself care about the characters. I did not finish the book; I only read about 40%. Maybe the second half is better, but he broke the rule of hooking the reading in the beginning of the book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game has many cool features with different regions and diffrent animals I love this game please get it and tell your friends
B000NY12LO|5.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult novel. I have seen her books in airports and book stores for years but for some reason I thought she wrote chic lit. Boy was I wrong! She is now my favorite author. Her plots could be the subject of any Dateline or 60 Minutes episode. Her characters seem so real and likeable, even the &#34;bad&#34; guys. I plan to read everything she has written.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Haven't played long but so far the game has fun but easy puzzles and mysteries to solve. Will check more games by this designer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is so addictive. It never grows old.  Just more challenges that make the previous levels seem so easy
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Great small bag. Not much room in main compartment for more than a large camera, but there are three pockets. I had charger in one, two spare batteries in another, cleaning cloth and business cards in the third. A real bargain.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Elegant clean-up design separates this press from the field.  By a wide margin.<br />Garlic presents a time-consuming, dexterity-challenging task in the kitchen.  Peeling and processing fresh garlic consumes time.  You smash each clove lightly with a knife, peel off the skin and slice or dice it.  This presents a grave challenge for the dexterity-challenged, and an opportunity for ingenious invention.  Hence the garlic press.<br />Perhaps the only device I have used with more success than a knife is the Rösle 12782 Garlic Press.  The Rosie will extract a fair proportion of crushed garlic from an unpeeled clove, and, unlike other presses, cleans up quickly and easily due to its clever design.  If you peel the cloves first, then align them in the chamber to pass lengthwise through the strainer, you can get a result very close to finely diced garlic (that is, without releasing fluid from the garlic).<br />Cleanup is what differentiates this from other presses.  (Generally, cleanup is the weak point of most kitchen gadgets.  Or storage.) The chamber of a garlic press requires repeated cleaning during each use.  Digging out the chamber is time-consuming.  By contrast, cleaning the Rosle chamber is instantaneous because of the elegant design of this press.  I takes a moment to deduce how to load the chamber with its unusual two-part design, but once it is understood, this is by far the most efficient garlic press available.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Absolutely Beautiful, she has done it again!  If you are a fan of her many albums, this one does not disappoint.  I love to listen when I walk.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The Clean Master is easy to use. I was able to download and upgrade easily. I would recommend this app.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This collection is pretty sweet.  The clarity and extra features are just what I expected with the Blu-Ray edition.  I also have the Next Generation collection which I wouldn't want to do without.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun game! It has many different levels, but what's even more fun is that there are different power ups and combos to make things interesting!
0385523394|5.0|This is a fun and very interesting book. I know someone who is in a women's prison, and sent it to them. Many of the other inmates are reading it now, also. The book makes some good points and has many good lessons in it. The Netflix series is based on it, but definitely veers off in its own directions.

B000FA5SMK|3.0|This one took me a while to get invested in this one, I like this author but this one was a little slow and hard to stay interested in but once you get into it, it's worth the read! I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read murder msytery
B00009V7PJ|1.0|the disk does not work  I will have to  buy a clearing kit to get it to work not good
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Warm Bodies is fun, funny, heart warming and deceptively deeper than expected. Nicholas Hoult delivers a performance that's anything but zombie-like. &#34;R&#34; is insightful, funny, and awakens to more than romance. Julie (Teresa Palmer) is strong, determined, pulled between zombie hating, and her growing human zombie love. Slightly grab-your-date scary, 'Warm Bodies' is  funny, a watch-more-than-once  date night movie.
0399226907|4.0|I bought this book as a Christmas present for my little brother. I got it on time and is the right book but much much smaller than expected! !
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Each chapter had me wanting to turn the page to see what was going to happen.  I had no clue who truly was in on the whole scam.
1451695195|5.0|Received book very timely and in good condition--subject was interesting-author was knowledgeable of the human body and how it works--he was able to conclude that he was in another world.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's great when it works, audio and picture quality if excellent. However, my iPhone and iPad don't &#34;see&#34; it as available at least half the time. I've re-set it up as a new device multiple times, but I still have problems. And of course, the tech support people are the only ones who work less than the government, so good luck getting help from them unless you take a day off to call when they're actually there.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|like others wasted too much money on a game with sooo many problems.  Lost a lot of credits and money to have it keep fn up all the time. problems on your side not mine so keep your solutions to yourself. So since I can not play this game no matter what they t.ell me to do, it still crashes and frezees. too bad it was a good when IT WORKED. this game sucks and i'm deleting it  even if i'm losing over 20,000 in coins 300 in credits 100 power up. can't use them on a game that don't work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i've had this game for a while now and i still love playing it. works great on my kindle and I think its more fun than temple run.
B0063S3FSW|5.0|When I saw the cover of the movie and read the back I assume this was going to be a boring movie. It turned out to be a great movie that I enjoyed watching with my family, it was very spiritual one also. Koro reminds me of my own grandfather that ran his house and neighborhood with a iron fist you knew when he was in the room. He demanded respect and it was his way of living that he wanted you to live by. It was know changing his mind unless you could prove it not by showing him but proving it to him. Pai reminds me of my baby girl fighting for want she wants proving to the doctors and this cruel world that we live in she will overcome all odds against her and make it just like all the other 7 year olds out here. She has been mistreated and misunderstood and she still is a happy little girl with a bright future ahead with many people cheering her own.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is one very great game that you got to play you must get the game get it now I said now
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Keep it in the car for it's compactness, little use so far, although it could be a little awkward to grip at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great for kids it is really fun it's just a awesome game and you unlock I recommend to all ages
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella! Whenever a new title comes out, I am first in line. This book was definitely one of my favourites yet, and I was entertained throughout. I love that her books are flowing and so easily readable. Poppy was a laugh-out-load character, and her antics entertaining. Perfect for a night in snuggled on the couch. Good job Ms Kinsella, look forward to the next one!
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I was psyched about the movie, and they did a very good job overall, but there is a lack of Baum-ness to it, I think.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So, here's the thing: I could care less about this game.  I haven't played it yet, and it might be good for all I know.  That Isn't the point.  What is the point is that I just got paid 110 Amazon coins to download this title.  Sounds like a deal to me!
B0053KWDES|5.0|This amplifier works amazing, at first i was skeptical if it was gonna make any difference at all but it does. I use it with my audio technica headphones makes a big difference.
B008US4PBY|5.0|Finally a effective solution to using my Xbox controller on the PS3 AND having the ability to remap the triggers.<br /><br />I've used the third party controllers that had a more Xbox ergonomic shape, or ones that had the option to swap the triggers with the bumpers.  They worked, but had issues, more often then not in the dead-zone or lag areas.  The XCM / HDE adapter worked and gave me turbo, but not the trigger swap (version 2 does, but at the cost of $100).  And it often refused to work properly.<br /><br />The Cronus just works.  I'm strictly employing it on a wired Xbox controller into a PS3 (update current as of 11/21), with the bumpers and triggers remapped/swapped.  Easy to setup, zero problems interfacing, no lag, Xbox controller performance & triggers where they're suppose to be.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|At the end of the movie my boys cheered, &#34;go Turbo go?&#34; over and over and jumped and danced when he crossed the finish line.
B00C1040TO|2.0|it is so hard to navigate. do not get it or it will probably not work for you. so so hard to do.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game!  Works well on kindle fire, very happy with the display.  Game is very entertaining although I would have liked to make my own character.
B000WJSCZE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. If I think back to the presentations that I have heard, the good ones all used the principles found in this book.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I would like it a lot better if it was faster but besides that  it is a pritty well made game
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Clear, concise and comprehensive coverage of how to get your e-book prepared and published. And it's written by Kindle Direct Publishing so it's likely to be on target and up to date. It focus on Microsoft Word but does mention other word processors. It also focuses on Kindle's preferred upload format, which is HTML but Kindle also excepts a few other formats and perhaps future issues  will mention those.
0385537131|5.0|Another GREAT Grisham book.  Hard to put it down!  One of my favorites by Grisham -- I have read them all!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting.  It is hard to leave!  I am so happy that it came to Kindle Fire.  Love the way it plays on the kindle.  I like the side play and the screen plays so well.  Love it!  I had stopped playing but when it came out on Kindle Fire I got my fix on!
B0007TKNIS|4.0|This performance doesn't measure up to the original cast vocally, but it adds some interesting special effects and scenes not seen in the original stage version.  The subtitles are quite helpful and add to your understanding of the songs, words, and plot no matter how many times you have seen the original.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found it extremely interesting and insightful. I've always been interested in a historical perspective of Jesus, and this book whet that appetite further.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for anyone interested in the historical Jesus and how the political, social, and religious unrest before, during, and after his life shaped (or manipulated) our modern perception of who he was and what he stood for.
B0055OMBIU|4.0|Gifted to friends who work puzzles regularly.  Their comments were that as history, and a help in planning their tour of Paris, it was quite interesting.  As a puzzle, they rated it as difficult.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is so funny I would recommend it to any (11 up) to read Diary of a wimpy kid my parents even enjoy diary of a wimpy kid
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|This one kicks butt! I am now an Alter Bridge fan! Always loved Myles Kennedy's voice! Works well with these heavy riffs!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy it!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Great band great CD enjoy every song. I also have Babel and cannot wait for their next CD. These guys are talented and wise to the ways of making original music that is witty and new sounding. Great job boys keep up the fine song writing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I also have this game on my galaxy S III and I absolutely love it!!! I'm totally addicted to this game;)
B004R1VXYU|5.0|This band is talented. just when you think you have them figured out they change directions and blow your mind with an even more catchy twist. Every song on this CD is fantastic. If you like heavy southern rock/ heavy metal/ southern country with great guitar solos and catchy everything. You'll love this as much as I do. Don't be afraid the spend the $10 to $15 to get this CD YOU WON&#34;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far so good, I keep trying to hook up with Facebook but so far the app or Facebook is not allowing it right now ... this version is different than the version on Facebook ... but some of the same characters are making themselves at home ... enjoying the game, it appears to be functioning well on my kindle HD .. except for the little hang up I mentioned before ... it is early in the game play and time will only tell ..I hope Zynga does not ruin this game like they have Farmville and a couple others by heaping on too many things to accomplish at one time. I don't mind a challenge but the other games got to be too much and lessened the enjoyment. I am happy to see this game here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun me and my brother all play this game I think everyone sould play this game
0321934318|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone that uses Lightroom. Scott Kelby is clear on each topic. Is not a book one will fall asleep reading, or find it too technical not to understand.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Please make this available for windows phones! I recently passed on my Iphone to my daughter and decided to give the new Nokia Lumia windows phone a go. Not once have I missed the iPhone, just some of the apps. So please make available for windows soon. I have the amazon kindle app on my phone now but it only allows me to reads my books.
B00004STDN|5.0|A very intense, action packed movie that kept me on the edge of my seat and wondering what was coming next!
B00FB029IU|5.0|In today's music industry, it's almost unheard of to release your second album only 13 months after your first, but 19-year-old Jake Bugg has the goods to back it up.  I was concerned about the album coming so soon on the heels of the first, as well as the pairing with Rick Rubin because I didn't like what Rubin did with &#34;Broken,&#34; but I can't stop listening to this.  To fans of the first album, I understand if &#34;What Doesn't Kill You&#34; and &#34;Slumville Sunrise&#34; might concern you at first.  I read a lot of complaints that he was already changing his style too quickly.  But taken in context, they are simply progressions on the rockabilly/Johnny Cash sounds of &#34;Troubled Town&#34; and &#34;Taste It.&#34;  The first six songs here are incredibly strong.  &#34;All Your Reasons,&#34; &#34;Storm Passes Away,&#34; and &#34;Simple Pleasures&#34; are other highlights.  Only &#34;Kingpin&#34; has yet to do much for me.  I'm excited to see how Jake's career progresses.  He's the real deal and I discovered him earlier this year mainly by accident.  Glad I did.  Great songwriter with many quality years ahead!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was great to read and thanks for putting this dictionary out for free thank you it was really fun to read

B000UR9QIK|5.0|A progenitor of the genre!  On both the horror and the humor front, it still stands head and shoulders above the myriad zombie movies that came after...
B008JFUN50|5.0|This was the best movie I've seen in a while. My boyfriend and I couldn't believe it when we heard the guys behind us say it was alright. Everyone has their own opinions, though. I can't wait for it to come out!! Action-packed and jaw-dropping all the way through.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|After 8 months of on again and off again reading, I finally finished all 5 of the Game of Thrones books, and this was easily one of the best in the series. It mainly focuses on the characters that you really care instead of a lot do new characters like the previous book. It also sets things up very well for the next one.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|FUN book.Not the the great American Novel but it's not supposed to be.Another in along line of continuing story lines from these Authors.The price was great 3.00bucks for a well written novel is unheard of.So for everyone who enjoys Quest, murder and mayhem novels congestive IT a try.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice go to game when I just want to unwind.  I like that the game keeps the running score.  Only question I have is why after some months of playing the game my score was zeroed out.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson is a master story teller, enthralling the mind's eye and engaging the reader completely. Bound to become a defining work of the fantasy genre.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I chose this book based on reviews I read.  The book was  interesting and amusing, combining an overview of world history with a wacky dry humor.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|What I wanted to order. Had VCR and needed to update.I sent this on to my grandchildren who love the movie.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Great script, stellar cast, and funny at times where you wouldn't expect it to be.  I'm a big fan of Titus Welliver, and he plays Childs brilliantly!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I think that because Royals is playing on the radio, she is getting a greater mixture of people listening to her music whose tastes vary. I am glad to see how few one-star ratings there are here, because this album is intimate and beautifully done, and she should be proud of herself to have refined her work so well at such a young age. If you treasure honest creative writing, a strong and beautiful voice, and an edge in your music, I would recommend taking the time to listen to the whole album through. The songs flow well into each other and because it really is what I would consider to be a poetic album, I think you will be missing a lot to not give it more a fair amount of attention (although I like the way it sounds in the background too).<br /><br />I also want to mention that for someone her age, she has a refreshing perspective. Many don't notice it when they only recognize the chorus of Royals on the radio, but she is aware of what messages are being distributed in pop culture today, which is wonderful. Overall, a beautiful and intelligent album.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Everyone kept telling me I had to see this movie (and/or read the book).  I finally got around to doing both and WOW!  What a great story.  Deals with a lot of controversial issues but really a wonderful insight into life.
B00GINENG0|5.0|the game is fun and if you play this you will be like awww!!! You really nee  to try this gamee!!!
B007NZQU72|4.0|I like this book except that the title is kinda negative.  For a lot of sensitive people they world feels intense and too fast, too everything but not necessarily overwhelmed.  That said, this is a really good book with great ideas for not feeling so different from the rest of the world.  Good tools for dealing with life.
B000001GAM|3.0|All things have their binary opposite in the universe.<br /><br />At first glance, the Rabbit of Caerbannog was nothing more than a harmless white bunny in the eyes of King Arthur and his Knights (Monty Python). Little did they know that this \\"foul and fearsome beast\\" would decimate their ranks and cause survivors to soil their suits of armour. It took nothing less than the Holy Hand-Grenade of Antioch to send this monster into oblivion.<br /><br />Conversely, everyone knows of Giulini's recording of Bruckner's Ninth with the Vienna Philharmonic. It is the stuff of legends. It can only be discussed reverentially (should one genuflect?). I daresay that a petition has already been flung at Deutsche Grammophon: remaster it soon! Guilt assails me as I pen this review.<br /><br />If you ask me, this is Bruckner played at a funereal tempo by a great orchestra and that is about it. As such, it's a one-trick pony. Tension is seriously lacking throughout. Robert Simpson acutely said that Bruckner himelf was terrified by his own creation: I cannot hear that in this performance. Nor can I hear a meta-narrative in play. The Vienna Philarmonic being who it is, it cannot help be spasmodically impressive (and especially so when the recording is so good). That still leaves this drudgery a long way short of Furtwangler '44, Kna '50 (broadcast), Karajan '76 and Barenboim '93.<br /><br />Leave this sort of glacial approach to Celibidache who has the wherewithal to sustain it.<br /><br />All in all, this is the anti-Rabbit of Caerbannog.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Sorry, Leo.  Great acting in this movie but the story was bizarre and depressing.  Watched it for movie night and the reviews were mixed.  About half the group loved it and the other half thought, &#34;Well, that's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back.&#34;  It did stream well through and was good quality.
0547884591|5.0|Awesome book in it's clarity and scope. It is also a beautiful copy table book - the hard copy that is. Not sure I will ever get through every page, but I don't think that is the intention.<br /><br />Go through the basics of both cooking and learning to learn anything, and then browse through the rest if you are ever faced with having to cook squirrel over an open flame - good grief. Like I said, incredible scope
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|Doesn't get any better.  Just a great concert to a part of.  The sound quality and being on Blu-ray are the best that you can expect.
B00009P1O0|4.0|For any other lesser artist this might be a five star effort, but this album is not quite up to par with the rest of Young's catalog.  Not to say it's not great--it is in many ways.  But over the years \\"On The Beach\\" has dropped a notch for me.  The album seems more like a part of history when Neil was going through a phase.  There are songs that are reflective, but in a more personal and depressive way than normal.  Some songs express an anger and bitterness that comes across in clever and humorous lyrics, but things that I can't relate to like I do in other music Young has put out.  We zero in on where Neil Young must have been at that time in his life and a bit too much about him and not the listener.<br /><br />When this album first came out I played it over and over because I was in a somewhat depressed time of my life and I wanted music that could be the soundtrack for that time of my life.  I guess I was able to relate to this album in that sense from the depth I was in.  I guess this album is good for that.  Not where I care to be again.  \\"On The Beach\\" is not a \\"blast from the past\\" or an \\"oldie but goodie\\", but it is a snippet from that era or maybe something that speaks to our downer side.  If I want downer music, there are other better albums, though repeated listenings to this album will probably bring you down plenty.<br /><br />But it's Neil Young and since he is among the greatest of modern era singer songwriters, this album is worth listening to if you've never heard it.  For me it's mostly a memory and won't be a Young classic that will get repeated playings in my future.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|There is no greater singer in the world than Andrea Bocelli and if your Italian, well just seeing the Portofino scenery and the people of Italy is very inspiring.  I was disappointed because they didn't show the whole performance as what was originally on PBS.

B00337KM2S|4.0|Bob Dylan's song 'Dignity' came to mind, though 'Decency' would be more apt.  You can run but you can't hide; on one touchdown or another one encounters family, where caring still finds an audience.  Home, where charity begins.  Didn't like Juno, but I think I got this one. I recommend it to anyone on a similar wave length, whatever that may be.  Social Darwinists might not be pleased..
B00EO64S68|5.0|At first glance, I flinched on the price. It seemed a bit much to be spending on the book. I bit the bullet, however, because I'm a huge fan of the book; I wanted a special copy.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was happily surprised. It came specially wrapped, like someone had shown care to the book that I wanted in my special collection. In addition to the book, a small pouch with an Auryn necklace was included. From the images, it seemed like the Auryn necklace was just a prop, and I didn't see it as being part of the book. Nevertheless, you get your own necklace. I thought that was a nice touch.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it's just stunning to hold. It's obviously just a touch smaller than the prop in the movie, but it's of superb quality. The binding, the leather outer covering, the text. Every detail of the book was well done. I held this book and said, &#34;I don't regret paying $200 for this.&#34;<br /><br />If you're on the fence, I recommend it. Such a great book to own and this special edition is worth it.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This game is fun and can be addictive!! I enjoy playing it several times a day. The only draw back is it is slow on the updates. Almost Thanksgiving and still showing Halloween.

B004ZN9W5M|5.0|\\"The Wall\\" is an album that I have been putting off reviewing for many years, primarily because I fear that writing a review, even a positive review, would prove counterproductive in demonstrating that record's greatness. But reading these reviews on Amazon.com shows that all my doubts were for nothing. It proves without a doubt that while most of the classic rock albums in the 1970s have dated horribly, \\"The Wall\\", far from aging, far from becoming a dated artifact, has grown more relevant through the passage of time. Selling nearly 25 million copies and STILL a profound influence on today's boldest and most compelling rock and rap artists, \\"The Wall\\" is not only one of Pink Floyd's greatest achievements; it's one of the undisputed masterpieces of rock n' roll.<br /><br />Where to even begin to talk about my love for the album? During the \\"Animals\\" tour, Roger Waters became increasingly disenchanted with the enormous success and growing popularity that Pink Floyd was getting. Waters' disgust at the mindless masses culminated in the infamous incident during one of the tour's final shows, when Waters angrily spat at a disgruntled fan. The incident became the seed for Waters to write numerous demos and songs detailing the feeling of isolation between a music artist and his fans, the past emotional traumas inflicted on him, and, indirectly, the parallel between fascism and rock stardom. The result was \\"The Wall\\", an ambitious, emotionally confessional two-disc odyssey about the mental and emotional disintegration of a gifted rock star.<br /><br />Even compared to great concept albums like The Who's \\"Quadrophenia\\" and the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", there was nothing like \\"The Wall\\" before. Each song from top to bottom was so meticulously detailed, so strongly integral to the album's story and themes that Roger Waters treated even the most slighted tracks with the care and detail often given to the more elaborate, radio-friendly singles. Each of these tracks were essential listening; you cannot fully grasp the meaning of \\"The Wall\\" by skipping some of these tracks. Sound effects and voices were abundant and extremely vivid, giving the album a cinematic fervor. Orchestra, last heard in \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" was now back with a vengeance on songs like \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" and \\"The Trial\\". Most of all, the potent themes of madness, alienation, oppression and anti-authoritarianism, subtly sketched in \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\", were now pushed to the forefront. This wasn't a rock album anymore; this was rock opera.<br /><br />Equally intense was the growing frictions within the band during the making of \\"The Wall\\". Richard Wright, the band's keyboardist, was falling to the wayside (and eventually fired in the last days of recording); drummer Nick Mason became less of a band member and more of a studio session musician; and the relationship Roger Waters and David Gilmour, two of the band's major creative forces, was slowly and painfully deteriorating before our ears. That tension is audible throughout \\"The Wall\\". Yet it's also that same tension that gives the album an emotional depth and dramatic intensity that neither Pink Floyd nor the fans could have expected. Just as how the \\"Wall\\"'s protagonist was disintegrating, so was this great legendary rock band. It's painful to listen, yet hard to ignore and, when the experience is over, extremely impossible to forget.<br /><br />And indeed, it's hard to forget some of the \\"Wall\\"'s most popular and memorable songs - the irresistibly catchy anti-school anthem \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part II\\"; the macabre country-tingled ballad \\"Mother\\"; the scorching sexual drive of \\"Young Lust\\"; the haunting acoustic/electric hybridity of \\"Hey You\\"; the eerie menace and pulsating paranoia of \\"Run Like Hell\\"; and, of course, \\"Comfortably Numb\\", probably the grandest of all Pink Floyd songs, featuring some of the grandest of all guitar solos. These songs are forever etched in ourminds, while the more popular and critically acclaimed singles released at the time have fallen into obscurity.<br /><br />But to focus on the more popular songs of \\"The Wall\\" is to overlook some of the dazzling, undervalued gems pestering throughout the two discs. Besides \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\", both versions of \\"In the Flesh\\" are some of the most electrifying hard rock songs Pink Floyd has ever made (and indeed probably the closest to hard rock Floyd will ever get). \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" takes a Beach Boys choir and turns it into a riveting parody of the fascist mentality of a music cult. \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" begins as an aching distress call, only to transit into a beautiful classical guitar solo (it was sadly revealed that Gilmour did not play the instrument). \\"The Thin Ice\\" and \\"Nobody Home\\" are two of the album's most haunting ballads - the former begins somber doo-wop song before turning into a distorted rock song with a memorable power chord and the latter is a gentle piano ballad dealing with isolation and heroin addiction. \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\" avoids being potentially schmaltzy pity-party and becomes an ode of emotional heartbreak. And then there's \\"The Trial\\", an exhilarating blast of symphonic rock where our hero is put on trial for \\"showing feelings of an almost human nature\\" - the crashing choir in the end is just awesome.<br /><br />But these songs would probably never have been given great weight if it wasn't for Roger Waters' emotionally naked songwriting. There is no doubt that \\"The Wall\\" is Waters' baby, unsurprisingly since he was dominating the band at the time. That's what makes \\"The Wall\\" such a riveting experience - these songs are written and told by a man expressing his inner demons and repressed sentiments at his peers, at his enemies and, most of all, at his audiences. Waters' fingerprints are everywhere in \\"The Wall\\", lashing out at the audiences in \\"In the Flesh?\\", dismissing his school teachers in \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part II\\", lambasting his oppressive mother in \\"Mother\\", detailing his anguish at being betrayed by his love one in \\"One of My Turns\\" and \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\", pleading the government to \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" and even dabbing into theatricality in \\"The Trial\\". Rarely has one man so effectively transformed his personal feelings into stuff of musical legend.<br /><br />It's no surprise that an album as indispensable and as groundbreaking as \\"The Wall\\" was poorly received upon initial release. Rock journalists chided the record for its supposed kitsch, hedonistic production and overwrought songwriting. Nor did it help that \\"The Wall\\" came out at a time when punk rock and disco were at the height of their popularity, leaving progressive rock and hard rock behind in their own dust. To these critics, bands like Pink Floyd were the antithesis to what they felt was good, passionate rock n' roll such as the Sex Pistols, Crass, the Skids, the Damned, Generation X and the Vibrators. Of course, nowadays, most rock fans have either forgotten about these bands or express little desire to listen to them again.<br /><br />This is nothing new when a trailblazer like \\"The Wall\\" is disdained by music critics. Some of the greatest rock albums - \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\\", \\"Disraeli Gears\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Exile on Main St.\\", \\"Raw Power\\", \\"New York Dolls\\", \\"Bat Out of Hell\\", \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Nevermind\\" and the records by Queen, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple - were initially met with either critical apathy, commercial indifference or both. Even the positive reviews for \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" were more out of begrudging respect than sheer enthusiasm. Naturally, when critics talk positively about these albums these days, it is usually out of historical revisionism rather than genuine honesty. Just read the negative Rolling Stone review of \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and then its retrospective five-star review today to illustrate my point.<br /><br />But like the best of allrock albums, \\"The Wall\\" has been discovered again and again, not by writers but by people aspiring to become rock artists. The emotional potency, electrifying production values and anti-establishment themes of \\"The Wall\\" can be traced on some of the greatest of all modern rock acts, from Nine Inch Nails, Oasis and Guns N' Roses to My Chemical Romance, Smashing Pumpkins and Rage Against the Machine, from Queensryche, Public Enemy and the Flaming Lips to Radiohead, the Orb and Marilyn Manson. These artists and bands understood that \\"The Wall\\" spoke more about their sensibilities, their personal feelings and their ambivalent attitude towards stardom than their critics thought. When you're listening to Queensryche's \\"Empire\\", Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\", Marilyn Manson's \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" or Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", you are listening to the children of \\"The Wall\\". When you hear N.W.A. yelling out \\"F--- the police\\", Chuck D comparing prison time to slavery or Ice-T, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur discussing their struggles within the ghetto neighborhoods of Los Angeles, you are baring witness to the influence of Pink Floyd's masterpiece.<br /><br />Pink Floyd's music is unquestionably timeless - the kind of music that leaves listeners with an emotional high, a great feeling of discovery. Some people dismiss their work as old hat, yet the best of Pink Floyd - \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", \\"Meddle\\", \\"Obscured by Clouds\\", \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Animals\\", and, of course, \\"The Wall\\" - doesn't get old; it grows newer year after year. It is essential that you not only purchase \\"The Wall\\", but especially their other classics. It's true that they've had some duds (\\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\", \\"The Division Bell\\"), some bizarre oddities (\\"Ummagumma\\", \\"More\\") and follies that are more interesting to talk about than listen to (\\"Atom Heart Mother\\"), but classics like \\"The Wall\\" prove without a shadow of doubt that Pink Floyd were one of the greatest and most interesting rock bands on the planet.

B00006AG5N|5.0|They have redone this music, it sounds so much better than regular CD's.  I already have it and love it, has lots of songs.  Ordered this one for my friend.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|Great movie, much more true than fifty shades of grey.
B00FAOK0Y2|4.0|Very snug at first, took several minutes to get it out!!! Didnt see the tab that helps bring it up slowly. I had used an Otter box on my last phone and decided to go naked on 5S but needed protection when I put it in my purse. Loosens up and works out great
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app.  I bought the full version because I wanted to play stuff in the the background.  Great!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Information, Insight, and Interestingness.  These are three things I look for in a book and this book deserves a 5 star in all three.  I couldn't put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator often on my Kindle.  Huge numbers, the ads are small and out of the way, and I mean really, who can math anymore?  Def not me.
075669812X|4.0|My son loves the book and that is all that matters.  It is a comprehensive view of all the Ninjago characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wow this game is very addictive. You just want to keep on going. Don't make another one of the too soon, I haven't gotten that far yet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I played this game on my kindle fire and now I play it on my KINDLE fire hdx 8.9. I have always liked this game.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Anything that is a live show from the Greatful Dead is a five for me. What took so long for this to get released?
B00ER23V1W|5.0|One of the best soundtracks ever! Perfectly apt for the movie, but great to hear on its own also, specially if you are into ambient sounds.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game nice graphics great way to pass the time kids will enjoy this game this will be one of my favourite
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A very in-depth emotional movie.  You imagine yourself in the boat with your only company, of all things a wild lion, and you have to figure out how to survive a treacherous situation, the sea.  This movie touches your soul and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was very grateful when this became available on my Kindle Fire after receiving requests for months from friends. It is very addicting, interesting, intense and fun! Sometimes frustrating, but still fun:)
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|This is more of a 3.5 stars than a 4. It's a murder mystery coupled with bioterrorism on one side and an erotic extra on the other side.<br /><br />Told in the 2nd person point of view, it's sometimes confusing how Neil is omniscient. The author's creativity and imagination is fresh; sex and violence together isn't a breath of fresh air but add mystery and suspense, a little science fiction with a persona who needs more self esteem and you got yourself a worthwhile read.<br /><br />I can't really say I enjoyed it but I was glad to have read it while cruising through some of my queue.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Dimensionaut is a gorgeous and impeccably produced/recorded Prog-Rock debut album by Sound of Contact.  I admit to playing it non-stop for the last couple of days while I work.  There's a touch of Pink Floyd (\\"Not Coming Down\\" and \\"Realm of In-Organic Beings\\") and early Genesis (\\"Beyond Illumination\\") but it is more pop-oriented and modern sounding.  The closing track, Mobius Slip, is absolutely epic; some great drumming amidst otherworldly musical landscaping.  Bears similarity in the overall sound and quality with Milliontown, the standout 2006 album by Frost*.  HIGHLY recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm only on level five and they asked if I would like to rate it and I already love it so I completely recommend it.
0738212415|5.0|Excellent book! I did not expect it to be that good!<br /><br />It contains:<br /><br />1. Clear step-by-step instructions for a variety of drawings.<br />2. Advanced &#34;bonus challenges&#34; that go beyond the basic material of each chapter.<br />3. Student samples that provide inspiration for extended or alternative drawings on the same main idea.
B006JIVTBQ|3.0|The pilot intrigued me. I have never been one to enjoy horror stories, but this one got me going. I kept watching one episode after another. Then it got boring. Then it seemed just plain stupid. Jessica Lang is certainly the high spot, it is surely the best role of her career. She shines. It is too bad that they couldn't keep the momentum going. By episode seven I lost interest. I still tried to watch, but I just couldn't sit through any more....nonsense. Too bad.Ultimately, it became silly, as any silly, cheap, teeanage horror flick. Too bad.
B003VANOFY|5.0|bought this 2yrs ago. still going strong.<br /><br />- amazing audio/voice quality for skype.<br />- wireless can roam my house if i'm in the next room. from upstairs to downstairs is kinda spotty.<br />- battery life is decent still.<br />- volume control on the side is awesome<br />- it blocks out noise just by sealing around your ear (good or bad depending)<br />- great for doing things on computer late night without disturbing others<br />- by the way, (Spectrum 42970 Euro Banana Holder, Chrome) is an awesome hanger for this<br /><br />highly recommend.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I would say I love the book but I was so troubled and emotional of the story, not taking any thing away from Marcus and the beyond brave men in the story, but the real horror of war.  At times would just put the book down and weep.  I can not comprehend the bravery and courage these men have.  The Navy Seals are the real deal, I thank God that there are men and women willing to put down there lives for us.  God Bless them all.
0316017930|4.0|I enjoy books that are thought-provoking. Really is more of an informative book with lots of interesting observations to ponder. Honestly, I am still reading it so I'm not sure what my true final thoughts will be
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This could be a great game if the screen didn't freeze up and bounce you out of game.  Also, on several occasions I wrote customer service of credits not received and they couldn't be bothered to respond.  Thank God for Amazon's amazing customer service returning my money.  When talking to customer service they indicated that they had the most complaints on this game.  Play at your own risk!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I started to read this book as it was recommended by so many people and with the upcoming movie, it had to be a good read, right?  WRONG!  I can't believe that people enjoy this rubbish!  At chapter 4, I was worried, by chapter 10 I was annoyed by how terrible the book was.  To be honest, I'm not sure how far I got into this book because I stopped paying attention and then stopped reading altogether.  Sure, there were steamy sex scenes but the \\"plot\\" was so terrible & both characters and circumstances were so unrealistic it was hard to get absorbed.  Personally, I thought the book was a waste of time & can't imagine how it became a trilogy and much less how they can turn this into a movie.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is stunning. Ang lee deserve best director,  its a beautiful movie. The storyof Pi and Richard the tiger is rare and unforgettable. It deserve all the buzz.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I'm not sure why this movie bombed.  Sure, it's formulaic and predictable, but it's funny, entertaining, & suspenseful.  This movie will not change your life, but if you want a fun movie to watch then you'll find it here.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Good game. I like my youngling like. Good game for free. A lot of up grades makes this game way cool.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was chosen for an eighth grade reading project where I live.  It went through proper channels and was approved.  Because of some cursing in the book,  leaders of a few churches went before the school board protesting the book.  The book WAS PULLED.  I AM APPALLED!  The message in this book certainly out ways the small amount of language that does not equal what eighth graders are exposed to from their peers at school.
B007V9N5R8|5.0|What a difference this has made in my photo Processing. I can stop trial and error printing for correct color. WYSIWYG !
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It was a great book. Quick read and very captivating. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes fantasy type stories.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Wonderful game<br />Wino recommend this. App to anyonenice graphics and nice tiles<br /><br />Easy for all ages. Love love ,love it!!!!!
034580404X|3.0|Amazon was great in the shipping part and the price was great!  After reading two of the books I can not see what all the hoopla is all about!  Guess being 50 myself and been there done that bought the t-shirt stained the t-shirt stretched out the t-shirt and now using it for a dirty cleaning cloth...was not impressed! (-;
B00B7FOQCK|1.0|I tried this brand for a second time, and the disappointment is worse now than the first time.  How can one make a simple device like a USB hub that will not function???  Cheap materials.  One of the ports never worked.  I ignored that since there were four ports and I only needed three.  My Microsoft keyboard would not work but I blamed that on the keyboard needing a direct connection to my laptop.  When I removed the printer cable, a piece of the \\"female\\" connector of the port broke off and was stuck in the \\"male\\" connector of the cable.  I am not a novice in dealing with computers.  This is just another piece of junk.  I have pictures.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|The app has a nice design. It is easy to navigate through, and I love how it tells you how many hours of sleep you'll get. Very helpful.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Really an excellent selection of the history of film, and we have really been enjoying it.  Highly recommended for any film lover.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this game so far. I only wish that it wouldn't take so long to make things or cost that many crowns to speed up the process.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved the book mr. Grisham you still got it read the last five chapters three times thank you joy a ross
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I don't usually give reviews on movies because it's such a subjective genre, some people love zombies others don't. I happen to love zombie movies and this movie is one of the best. The Blu-ray picture is excellent however I did have problems retrieving the digital copy which I found to be time consuming and annoying, I suggest you skip the digital copy version unless you have a lot of free time to waste.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham does it again.I love his stories always have you on the edge the whole time. Can't wait for another one.
B0089XH38M|3.0|Works ok but the dang thing is It keeps notifiyng me on the top that I have to download new updates online and most of them just do it automatically!
1780387105|5.0|Great book when used with his online course! Very helpful and not intimidating unlike other music books filled with jargon.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This game is so dang addicting! I play it on facebook and have it on my kindle too, so when I can connect to face book on Wifi then I can go further! Way fun
1573225517|5.0|Great story, but if you're looking for it to be exactly like the movie you'll be disappointed. The movie is pretty faithful as far as plot points, but they changed some of the character names and the setting. I love this story, and I love that we as readers aren't necessarily supposed to like the main character. Nick Hornby is a really good writer, and I don't think he gets nearly enough credit.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I'm so stinking aggravated, I have been trying to watch some videos on an up coming procedure I am having done and it downloads to the most has been 77% and then it just does nothing! Kindle fire HD.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is the Best Angry Birds Game Yet !!!!  It`s great to have a Star Wars themed Game like AB Star Wars 2 !!!
B005JE7XW0|5.0|The title kept me from watching it at first. The description convinced me to give it a shot. The movie overall was pretty funny.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow! Who would have guessed this ending!? Slavery,cruelty,total dominion, rebellion. Who will die next? Will the rebellion be squelched again? Can't wait for the next book! Fast moving story with lots of twists. It would hold the interest of any young reader.
0385537131|5.0|The author is always a great read and the book was in very good condition have many Grisham books already
0446530573|5.0|Awesome cookbook. Some of the recipes have unusual ingredients for the every-day cook (sardines, tripe...not every recipe is this extreme), but if you're experienced with making more than just simple spaghetti and meatballs you'll thoroughly enjoy this book. In addition, the stories are so fun and interesting to read. I highly recommend this to any Italian food fan. Even if you are just a fan of the show and not overly enthused about cooking, this is still a great book.
B005VPRF9I|5.0|My son adores this. He has gotten really good at spinning :) I love hearing him chatting to himself as he arranges battles. The price seems really high ($27) for what's a simple toy but I suspect it's artificially high since I've heard Lego is discontinuing these. Sigh.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works very well and has good build quality. I use it to connect to an old APC UPS. Note that this only provides a standard 9-pin serial port and is not a replacement for a serial cable. Therefore it has screw holes on the serial connector to accommodate a standard serial cable.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the entire trilogy, it was a page turner that is for sure. This book was sad, as all books are when it comes to the end.  I didn't enjoy the ending or it wasn't what I hoped for, but it makes sense
0385738765|3.0|Bought this for a gift.  It was the book he wanted, so I can't give<br />A rating on the contents.  The book came in excellent conditions.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The story was a good one. I thought the characters were a little confusing at times. They seemed to all blend together at times and I had a hard time keeping track of who was who. Grisham is always a good read though.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|This game, when I downloaded it, it got rid of all of my storage. I deleted ALL of my other games for this piece of crap. Is there some other way to download it? If there is, tell me cause I won't try to download it literally the 15th time
B00957T6X6|5.0|The convolutions in the story lines are so twisted you never know what is going to happen next. I love it. Predictability is so overrated.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This game was better than I expected it to be, it is in NO way a doodle jump copy in my eyes. I Love it.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|An intricate layering of characters, plots, times etc. all interconnected by the circus and reality vs fantasy. Intriguing, thought provoking.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Be Aware: Though the product description lists Google Chrome as one of the applications that you can 'cast' to the TV, this only works with Chrome on non-Android devices!  You will not be able to cast your CHROME sessions from any Android device. A big disappointment for me, especially since the name implies that you can cast CHROME browser sessions with no restrictions. Google is aware of this and is supposedly working on an Android Chrome version that will be compatible.  Other than that, Pandora, You Tube, Netflix and Movies worked nicely.  So I will keep the device for that purpose.
B0000027RL|5.0|I just replaced my original TEN CD after 20 plus years of listening to it. If that isn't a testament to how amazing this album is, I don't know what is. Still loving & listening to it after 20 years with as much love as always. Probably my fave rock album ever...my fave songs are Garden & Release, but there is no filler here. Quite simply, this is a BEAST of an album everyone should have in their collection. Deserves 10 STARS. and Lightning Bolt, their newest is my fave album this whole year!
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|Great album!  But, sometimes the message of the song can fall flat on someone who won't stop to think about them. I would have been more interested to hear the double disc concept, one being POP music, the other being more experimental ART music.  I expected more.  But, still has some fun, catchy songs.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I agree with those who say giving It a few listens before writing a review is the way to go. Pearl jam have such a distinctive sound, that anything new & different can be a letdown for SOME people, but true PJ fans welcome & appreciate everything they put out. I love this album. I like the juxtaposition of hard rockers to softer, more sentimental tunes. The lyrics clearly show a more mature & appreciative band, and what else should they be after 20 plus years? Anyone looking for another TEN, needs to get over it and realize that was 20 years ago! Bands & singers evolve. I am just so grateful all the original guys are still together putting out music & touring after 20 years! So many of my fave bands are gone, singers die, thy break-up etc....so thank goodness we still have this group of guys. My fave songs from LB are Yellow moon & Future days, but I love it all. Thank you PJ!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I always enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell. I find his work challenges me to visit some long held, usually comfortable assumptions and broaden my views.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Fantastic book and a great third installment.  I loved the ending and thought it was perfect.  Would definitely recommend! Veronica Roth is an amazing writer.
B004AQR29C|4.0|I'm not a big fan of any of these action actors.  But this was an enjoyable movie to watch.  Of course, the women are transparent and barely exist except to rescue.  Lots of blow-up gun fighting fun.
B009AMALGM|2.0|Yet again they don't answer any questions from previous films in the series. The ending is incredibly stupid. I really think they should have ended the PA series after two or three maybe, apparently there is a PA 5 in the making...ugh
B00000JSJC|4.0|Love this movie.  Acting very good, very suspenseful, and gets a bit intense.  Was ahead of its time.  The device they use in the movie is now the Google eyewear.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|For a film I have been meaning to see for years but never really got around to it, It kept me entertained the whole time. Hitchcock is a master even 53 years later.
B0057AOS3I|5.0|My first Beyonce CD/album.  And I play this all the time.  This CD is different than what's she's done before with songs and her vocals are strong.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I LOVE this game just read the instructions first and try out some new moves every once in a while or make your own
B007RV6X2Y|3.0|This movie is a VOD/DVD movie, and it's a bit disturbing.  There's a part in the movie where the protagonist finds out the girl he's protecting is a close relationship and that's a big disturbing.  I loved the movie until the end.  Samuel L. Jackson gives his all, and I think this is one of his better roles.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Funny, quirky and good time movie!  I have seen it about 20 times now and smile each time.  Great music!
B00DMKFN34|2.0|Buyer beware... this is not a PIXAR film and it shows.  Originally meant as a direct to DVD release in the US.  Poor representation of the Cars universe.
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|this movie was ok, the highlight was channing tatum not the plot.  we had watched Olympus Had Fallen around the same time and it was the same plot but a much better storyline in my opinion.
0385743564|5.0|Of all of the books I have read, this one affected in a  very different way. I know a book is good when I am done with it and I feel myself demanding more. Steelheart did this for me, but in a way I had never experienced before.<br /><br />At the end of Steelheart I was left with a range of emotions I had never before at the end of a novel. Yes it had a good storyline, an intriguing world, and an entertaining blend of passion, humor, and action. Yes it left me guessing at what would happen next and it had not one twist, but several twists in the end. Yes it kept me on the edge of my seat and demanded I not put it down. Many great books have done this for me; Steelheart is the only book I have ever read where I was literally left missing it's characters.<br /><br />When I finished the book, I wanted more, not necessarily because of the story or the action or the world, but because I wanted to spend more time with the people I had grown so attached to during the adventures we experienced together. When it was all over, I just didn't want to let go of them.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book in the series.
006202406X|5.0|Surreal but logical ending.<br /><br />I do not see why or what others find so strange with the premise of the story line.<br /><br />It may not be the happiest or a lovers ending but it follows a credible and realistic outcome.<br /><br />A reasonable and possible result to a fiction that could very well take shape in some form in the future world of Social Engineering.<br /><br />Really people get a life its a story, make believe and construct to offer a look into fiction mixed with mind expansion and a premise that in spite of adversity and loss, HUMANITY can over come its own faults to try to improve itself in spite of itself.<br /><br />That People will do what must be done regardless of the personal cost and threat to their life.<br /><br />That social and mental diversity will triumph in spite of the well meaning but ill informed tampering to perform a so called poorly imagined reform of the genome.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />It is a good book and, interesting and not a standard run of the mill happy ending but still a good final outcome.
B000002MJC|5.0|This is one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums, if not my favorite. I do think this is one of those albums that might seem boring upon first listen, but once you give it a couple cohesive listen-throughs, it easily becomes a great album to escape to. Give this one a chance! My favorite tracks are probably &#34;I Feel You&#34;, &#34;Condemation&#34;, &#34;Judas&#34; and &#34;In Your Room&#34;.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|A well-told, beautifully portrayed life story that brought to light that we each have our unique way of interacting with the world and defining purpose based on our individuality.
B003GYEGNO|3.0|I really disliked all the main characters in this book. The writer writes in great detail but I thought it could have been shorter and not all the exacting detail of rooms or dress were needed. I only finished it because it was for a book club
B00DJ735KI|4.0|Great information, and answers questions I have had for a long time.  Thanks.  Only part way through with the book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I LOVED this book! It was such an interesting read! Kept me captivated and wanting more! I enjoyed that the book's ending was NOT predictable just like real life. We often don't realize how our lives are so closely intertwined or how our decisions affect others lives. I want to read it from the beginning ALL over again!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is a fun puzzle game.  And I like the cartoonish Vampire theme.  Would recommend to all who like puzzles.
B000002GJS|5.0|I loved the songs and the music. Brian Adams Rocks. Great CD to have. I love listening to the cd.
0385743564|5.0|I almost didn't buy &#34;Steelheart,&#34; by Brandon Sanderson. The premise promised standard comic book fare, and super-hero traditions hold little interest for me. But because I absolutely loved &#34;The Rithmatist&#34; and &#34;The Emperor's Soul,&#34; I decided to trust the author. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Sanderson rapidly pulled me in with a fast-moving, action-oriented tale about how human beings can act in the face of overwhelming power. The plot is straightforward but not predictable. The characters are distinctive, and I enjoyed every moment I spent with them. The writing is clear and graceful, and the copyediting is expert--no mechanical problems distracted me from the storytelling. I also appreciated that the book did not include any of the sordid, prurient &#34;love&#34; scenes that degrade so many works of fiction these days.<br /><br />All elements worked perfectly together to reinforce an admirable theme: Courage, ingenuity, and sacrifice ultimately win over despotism, regardless of how invincible the despot may seem. This story is more about the human heart than the title might suggest.<br /><br />The one caveat is the rampant violence in this book. Even though the violence is absolutely essential to the plot, and the scenes and events are no worse than those that you would see in a typical Hollywood action movie, readers who dislike violence cannot escape it in this book.<br /><br />At least one sequel is in the works. However, Steelheart is a complete story in itself, and the conclusion is profoundly satisfying.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation. With it, Sanderson has solidified his position in the ranks of my favorite authors.
B00B9EQS98|4.0|I got my video and I loved it. The movie was great to watch and it rocked. Adam Sandler is great.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is a great first novel. The murder scenes were amazing and I really liked the premise that the killer is aggravated by people who waste time. It makes the title an amusing fun. I read it in one night!
6305609721|5.0|I love Star Trek and this movie was great to watch. The cast rocks and the movie was awesome. Star Trek Rocks.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Amazing horror movie for 2013! You will not regret buying this on dvd, just because it has an awesome storyline and scares the **** out of you!!! 5 out of 5 stars.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Love the Pollyanna series.  These are good for child as well as adults.  Best to read the first book before this one
B00DBR8A60|5.0|I super love the watch. I am a girl but I still wear it. I love oversized watches. The watch is original too
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was read by my daughters. I bought it 3+ years ago. & decided to read it now.  They explained that it was a sad book but a great read . Somewhat challenging but written so the storyline continues to have you read on to see what happens next.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game!!! I really enjoy playing! Easy to learn but still challenging. Very good graphics too. I loved the movie also!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very entertaining game. I like it so far. Plus it is free. I haven't play it long enough to know if it starts to get boring.
B00E9A656K|3.0|This is the top of the line when it comes to tablet Racing games.Easy enough for beginners hard enough for hard core.
B00GFCMHHG|5.0|I didn't realize until after I bought both the CD and the DVD... \\"BU2B\\" wasn't included in the performance... kind of disappointing. [:^( But the performance that they do give is true Rush... AWESOME!!! [:^)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I tried not to like this game.  Then I played it<br />I.It is it is as addictive as everybody said!!!!!<br /><br />I love it
B007MNV5WU|5.0|When you first go to a world .(Like the candy one if you tap the popcorn cernals they pop and turn into popcorn.) OTHERWISE &hellip;I'd say this is the best angry bird game that the makers have ever made!(For now&hellip;heehee!
B00A9ET4MC|2.0|This story contains many thought provoking subjects about race, being black in America and contrasting experiences in Africa. I would have liked to give this book more stars but found it much too long and lacking in editing. I'm not one to give up but seriously had to force myself to finish it. I also found the main character selfish and unsympathetic. The love of her life was more appealing. I also found as other reviewers that there were way too many unnecessary characters included with difficult names to remember and of no real importance to the story. Must say I'm relieved to be finally done with it. Can't believe it's on Goodread's  list for one of the best novels of the year. Really ?
B008JFUR10|5.0|loved it at the theater, definite keeper. Monster movie in the Godzilla realm. Love that they still make this level of special effect monsters.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|These work great and we bought one for each car but it took a while to find/buy cords because they don't come with them.
B00GIZO674|5.0|I love this game. its a challenge and its fun!  I had it on my Pc and I am thrilled to have it on my kindle now!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Stupid and repetitive. Boring. The first book was ok but I gave up on this series. Silly and same old, same old.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|A very intelligent and surprising book, absolutely worth a read. The description of the interaction and consequenses of real and imagined circumstances is facinating.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|it is a great picture taking camera and I will use it for a while or a year and forever and ever.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I thought this app was challenging, and very enjoyable. A friend recommended it to me-- as an alternative to Solitaire.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Very good LEGO set if you love minecraft! Build is long and fun, and it is easily modifable to be what you want.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Bought it for my granddaughter who is a big Pearl Jam fan. She loves it!<br />Love Pearl Jam? Here you go...
B001974DG0|5.0|Best ever!!!  I've read Dean Koontz for years and still think this is his best book ever.  I've purchased it several times, just to make sure I'll always have a copy around...now need to get it for my Kindles.  The first time I read it I laughed out loud and then cried so hard that I considered throwing it away and not even finishing ii....so glad I didn't follow through.  This is a book I have given to many others....just the best book ever, not just by Koontz.  A must read, especially for an animal lover.
0061537934|5.0|Everyone else liked this book,  I found favorable reviews in the various car magazines and finally became one of the last people I know to finally read this book.  If you like cars, dogs, racing, suspense, or just a great story, this is the book.  I have loaned it to two people who &#34;couldn't get into it,&#34; but everyone else raved about it.
B00129XQ2W|5.0|This recording--and emphatically not the one published by EMI--is the definitive sound of Furtwaengler's &#34;Ninth&#34; from the concert reopening the Bayreuth festival. EMI's editions have been in circulation for more than half a century, but have been exposed as ersatz. In a note on the back inside cover of the booklet accompanying this CD, Orfeo's annotators very gently explain why this recording, and not EMI's, accurately reflects what was played at the Bayreuth performance. No less an authority than Henry Fogel describes the EMI sound as a &#34;fraud&#34;. It should suffice only to add that this performance has notably greater electricity than the sound from EMI, which goes to the trash-heap of history--a more suitable use of that phrase never was found. Henry Fogel goes on to say that the later performance by Furtwaengler and the Philharmonia at Lucerne, in 1954, deserves equal ranking with this one. I agree. I also have an irrational prejudice in favor of this Ordeo disc, because, after nearly six decades, it has brought the correct recording out of the obscurity in which it was forced to live. Hear this record, then listen to the one from Lucerne, and live happily ever after.
0525951652|5.0|Typical Follett, Great Research, well written.  The book works its fictional characters into a historically accurate framework.  I especially like it because it seems to  present the world through the eyes of people with widely different viewpoints.  This is great stuff!!!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|It shows me everything I need/want for the day.  Clean presentation; excellent graphics.  I recommend this app instead of TWC app.
0525952926|5.0|Typical Follett, Great Research, well written.  The book works its fictional characters into a historically accurate framework.  I especially like it because it seems to present the world through the eyes of people with widely different viewpoints.  This is great stuff!!!<br />I would definitely recommend that you get Fall of Giants and read it first.  If you have read Fall of Giants, I can't see how you can't read this book.
B00GIXWXEO|3.0|Cute film for kids, but pretty predictable. My kids loved it, but I actually didn't watch the whole movie. Just an ok movie
B004YXE438|3.0|It is ok.  I wanted something more like putting actual puzzles together and this isn't quite it. But i use it if i have not other puzzles to do.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Mr. Kaufmann has a truly great voice! His technical mastery in singing in many different languages and styles has become legendary! Wagner suits Mr. Kaufman's heroic voice well!
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|Not what I expected. But will play when I am bored with other games. The pictures are the most beautiful though.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This movie of Les Miserables is good! It captures much of the drama and heartache associated with the French Revolution! The xast is good and the Blu-Ray sound and pictures are exceptional!
B00F56AZK4|5.0|this is the closest app to real puzzling I have ever used. Lots of pictures to choose from and the actual turning of the puzzle pieces is appropriate to putting real puzzles together.
B004S699K4|1.0|Hello!<br />Thank-you for your follow-up, Amazon Marketing People.<br />I had a hosted a &#34;scary movie night&#34; with friends on Day Of The Dead, November 1st.<br />We all thought this movie was done poorly…it lacked good character development, story line, the list goes on & on!!<br />The blood seens looked like raspberry juice w/ the HD Blue Ray --Ha!<br />(Too bad…since I had planned to get the first edition, anyway…Halloween 1978 instead of H20 1998.)<br />Best regards,<br />Liz.
B00CZ1HELA|5.0|This is a great relaxing game and I love that I can play one level in just a minute or two while waiting in line. I don't have time for games that take a long time, that for my kids and the video game systems, this is perfect for my Kindle fire HD.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game..easy to play and you even get many chances to win!  Takes a bit to run out of game tokens but you get more in a few hours.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best collection of Beach Boy music. It takes me back to when they were on the radio and life was simpler. I wish I would have lived in California back then.
B00D2JDNQ4|3.0|The historical background was interesting but really no character or story development. After hours of reading little more is gleaned after the first time3 chapters.
B005OGS854|5.0|Great movie from start to finish. Very entertaining and kept our interest throughout. Will watch again. One of the better movies we have seen recently.
031623480X|5.0|Very well researched and written. Practical advice about balanced nutrition and how this affects your brain metabolism is given. I recommend this book to anybody.
0783226837|4.0|Tremors is  just scary enough for our younger kids without being too scary.  We enjoyed watching this together after Halloween.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|The best sound I've heard recovered from the old recordings. Complete archive. You can hear exactly why Robert Johnson is a master who has had immeasurable influence on subsequent blues artists.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|this was the first &#34;Scary&#34; movie for our younger kids to watch.  It was just scary enough to make them feel like they'd watched a real horror movie,  without giving them nightmares.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|I am trying to build up a collection of the older classic Disney movies for my granddaughter (2 year old) and of course she loves animation. This is perfect for she and I to watch together. I have a cat and she loves cats.
006202406X|1.0|Regretful there is nothing less than one star. I keep asking myself why would you kill off your heroine in a series? I don't escape reality to my reading for this. Not only do I regret reading, but will never re-read, or participate in any of the movies - what is the point? Really? Frodo - LIVES, Gandalf - LIVES, Katnis - LIVES, Endor - LIVES, Harry Potter - LIVES. These are the fulfilling escapes I depend on in my reading. beyond disappointing.....maddening. This author off my list.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This is the cutest love story around!!  I had been looking to find it for my granddaughter's Disney collection of the older classics and so glad I found it.  I know she will enjoy watching it and I will enjoy it to. We can snuggle together while I babysit when the (boring parents go out for the evening). Will go well with a little popcorn and warm cocoa.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Love watching videos when I'm feeling down.  Can skim for whatever will make me laugh and at times laugh and cry at the same time.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Can't put it down.  I really like it so far and I'm not one who really reads much.  I have really enjoyed it so far and can't wait to read it before bed every night.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love having Facebook on my Kindle and being able to access whenever I want and it helps keep in touch with family and friends.
B000EGCITG|4.0|I like most of the songs on this CD. She has one song with her father on the CD. Not bad for the price.
0812982622|5.0|Well written, engaging, it's an epic tragedy and deserves all the critical praise being heaped upon it. If you are hooked by excerpts, then you'll likely enjoy the whole thing.
B000A3DB7G|1.0|But, the DVD did not play in either of my players. It was a complete waste of my money.<br />I will not order anymore movies from Amazon now,<br />and I found a new place to get my movies after this experience.<br />I was looking forward to watching this, and I had to reorder it from another website.They got it to me right away---and it played!<br />Sahara is an action packed movie and I love the characters. I could not find it in any stores, so I ordered it to see it again.<br />I was writing a paper on it, and I needed the DVD right away to get the details right and accurate.<br />Then, it comes and it is defective!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I lovvvvvvvve playing this game<br /> it has brought endless hours of fun for me and my husband. we are constantly competing to see who can get furtherand ive completely destroyed Him!!!
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Great collection of Cher's music! I love it and will be playing it for quite some time. This is a modern style of her music.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great film. Action packed. Superb acting. Great special effects. Surprise ending. Has everthing you would want to see in a film.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Well the world clearly doesn't need another review of this book.  It is interesting to me that it has received any number of poor ratings yet was written about more than three thousand times, while many highly rated books languish with maybe a hundred.  There is obviously a place in all our lives for guilty pleasures.<br /><br />As for me, I liked the book.  I have read a few heavy, worthy books lately, and this book is like a sorbet to cleanse the palate.  Sookie is just such a dead pan commentator of society known and unknown.  She never met \\"a vampire who didn't love 'Thriller'\\". She haa definite wisdom to bear on any number of supernatural people.  She is comically targeted by every \\"sup\\" in sight.  This novel is a triumph of high camp, and I liked it.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|It's already been used and it's rusty. No good. Needs to come in clean and un-used not rusty, please read.
B00C1040TO|5.0|This is a really cool app! I downloaded it as the free app and I've been depressed ever since.<br />...to find out my once pitch perfect ear is no longer perfect... ;( .  LOL!  And my once soprano but now alto voice which used to hold notes without wavering...well no more. Of course I am over 50 and the voice just isn't there any more....so I'll just have to leave the singing to the professionals!! But I can still karaoke it....just so no one is near!! The beat goes on...and in blinking color no less!!!
B00FHATBGW|3.0|The game is ook........I do enjoy mystery games, Big Fish usually doesn't disappoint, but this one.......1st off, EVERY room (scene) looks exactly the same to me, and VERY VERY crowded. If I could engage with the crowdednsess, it might be ok, but th here are scenes with keys, swords, hammers, medallions, books, that do nothing. The color of the scenes is this reddish orange that just blends everything together. The art is fantastic, as always in big fish games,, but, this one was annoying. I finished the main part of the game, &amp; now am on the bonus content. I'm happy there is bonus content, because I was fairly disappointed with the game. The bonus IS GOOD so far. All in all, not necessarily a waste of  3 bucks, just not one of my faves.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app will let you see what channel your neighbors are on so you can change yours to one they are not using.  It will also check your signal strength to see if where you have placed it will be the best place for your needs.  It is great.  I would highly recommend it.
0385474547|4.0|I bought this book for my teenage daughter for a school assignment.she is really enjoying reading this book; she's almost done with it.
B002VL2PTU|4.0|I had to do a term paper on this video and I really thought it would be slow and essentially boring. IT WASN'T!! It was really put together well and I can now see why Michael J was considered the &#34;King&#34; of pop music.  He was a GENIUS!! when it came to music.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|SYCAMORE ROW is a really long John Grisham Book that returns to Ford County where a dying white man Seth Hubbard wrote a will leaving his fortune to his housekeeper, a black Lettie Lang.<br /><br />Bottom line, this book isn't that good. Grisham's rambling narrative style really means you never have a character to care about. The stakes aren't high at all, especially the racial tension that made A TIME TO KILL so good. Jake Brigance does nothing in the novel except react. And the final plot twist basically drops out of the sky to save the day.<br /><br />The great reviews surprise me. This book is good but easily forgettable because none of the characters are memorable, and the reader never feels like anything bad is going to happen to anyone.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|As always another great read by Patricia Cornwell. Kay Scarpetta once again takes you for a ride and teaches you along the way. I couldn't put it down!
B00EMIE0CA|5.0|great tunes by a great band which never gets old or out of style.  Good to have a newer CD in the collection.
B0013FSXT6|1.0|This movie does not work in my blu-ray player. Every other movie I have works fine. I'm losing faith in this website.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|A very useful book for entrepreneurs and product managers that are trying to build a scalable business. An excellent compliment to Steve Blank's work.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Very upbeat and happy music to listen to.  Bruno Mars' smooth voice and the peppy instrumentals will put you in a great mood.  Have at it!
1451695187|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a knucklehead. I know that he can read but I don't know that he read this book. So, I cant really critique the book, aside from what I've heard about it...and what I heard was that it is an amazing book.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The quality of this movie is directly proportional to your expectations of it.  My expectation was that it would have more to do with the actual flying instead of a story of a man battling morality and substance abuse.<br /><br />I had my expectations based on the previews that I saw for the movie.<br /><br />Overall though, I do think it was a good movie and would still recommend watching, just be sure that your expectations are in line.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I rented and watched this movie three times...back-to-back-to-back. Now I want to buy/own it. If you like straight forward uncomplicated simple story lines, this is not the movie for you. I was very well entertained!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Very upbeat and happy music to listen to.  Bruno Mars' smooth voice and the peppy instrumentals will put you in a great mood.  Have at it!
1452126577|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift, for one of my cat-loving coworkers. It looks hilarious and I think she'll get a kick out of it. Look at that puss, for cryin' out loud!
1439153663|3.0|If your time for reading is limited skip this one - there are way better books about the period and plantation life
B008CLI4N4|1.0|Terrible waste of money. Basically soft core porn that totally ruined the awesome story that the book is. Read the book and don't waste your time with this.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great storytelling and character development based from historical research. Wonderful perspective explored for understanding both history and architecture.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've just discovered pinerest and I'm ever so glad I did. This app works wonderfully! Unlike many others apps, this one hasn't been bothersome.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really  recommend  this book, the second one on this series. Katniss is more courageous this time and more determined to star the revolution in Panem.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Love playing this because I can easily access the program and can play for spurts of time. It is however very addictive.
145210655X|5.0|Perfect for a star wars fan boyfriend!<br />I haven't seen star wars but love the drawings and the paper quality.<br />It is cute and funny.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a very addicting game to play. I enjoy coming back to play it again and continue to try for a better score!
B00004RFCM|1.0|The only reason I am giving this rating is because the DVD was scratched and I can barely watch the first disc. I basically can only watch a couple of episodes and even then they skip. Very disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|enjoy this game and it keeps you busy and mind active trying to find all the pieces. works great on the kindle fire
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Very challenging levels. It is wonderful that it starts at a slower rate. It gives a person an opportunity to understand the concept of the game.
1609611543|5.0|This book has explained why I have had so much stomach trouble since I was young.  I have lost weight, and love not getting pain after I eat. Do I miss the wheat - yes - I was a bread lover, but balance it against the pain, and there are a lot of things that look very good, and taste very good also.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Amazing. Only thing that would have made it better is if it came with the original theatrical release as well as all the extra stuff that they release over years =]
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|You are really going to enjoy trying to figure out the answer to these<br />Emoji puzzles. They lull you into a false sense of security... and then they pull out the harder ones! I'm buying some 'hints' as we speak. I need them! I'm stumped already!
1568363931|5.0|I've wanted this cookbook for the past six months or so, so glad I finally picked it up. Great pictures and instructions.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a great book! If you read and liked Gillian Flynn' s other 2 books, you definitely won't be disappointed by this one!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought more would happen in this one, but it was good.<br /><br />It is interesting to see Katniss wrestle with so many conflicting thoughts, but Peeta stands out as the character we should consider the most in terms of character.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Good read - although I figured out the twist 60 pages in - but I kept turning til the end because I became attached to the characters and their story. Another great read by Gillian Flynn!
B003JBI2KM|4.0|Very good introduction to (as the title says) Joy of homebrew - for people alread &#34;initiated&#34; in the art of brewing beer this might not bring much news but still a good reading. I do recomend and remember - &#34;Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew&#34;
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I would really like to give this book three and one/half stars because I liked it, but just barely. I think Hosseini is an incredible writer and a wonderful story teller. Readers who don't like to &#34;work&#34; hard to enjoy a book are advised that they might have to with this one--unlike his previous two books. I am not usually the type of reader who minds working hard to make sense of a book, but when I have to work hard, I want more for my effort. This book reads like a collection of short stories, which may be why it can be a bit confusing. All of the characters have some connection, some more distant than others. As always, the writing is very good. The individual character's stories are very good. The overall concluding thought or &#34;so what was this all about&#34; is a bit elusive, though.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|IT ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION...I REALLY ENJOYED IT I HOPE THERE BE ANOTHER PART THIS ONE IS FAR BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL...BRAVA!
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is really good. It contains. different levels of entertainment that keep you guessing what comes next. This is my first game from Novosoft : I will continue buying more games
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Awesome except you have to wait 45 minutes to scratch a ticket if you are out of plays; unless you buy a few games.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|I came of age in the 60's. High school, driver's license and enlisted in the Air Force. Throughout all this there was the music and the symbol of that music, the Guitar!<br />This blu ray of the 2010 Crossroads festival is truly awesome. To me the photography pulls the concert together along with the editing. Truly beautiful. I've seen other versions of this festival and they've all fallen on their butts. This is the best, the holy grail of this date in time.<br />Buy, buy, don't wait just get that card out and order this blasted disc set. Oh the music, the groups, the artists are great some more than others, we all have our favorites. I wept in parts, it just lifted my soul, especially in these trying times...
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game I find myself playing it all the time. Love th  game play. Wish it was easier to gain money. But overall I love the game. Keep up the good work.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game! Great graphics and love that I can plan anytime anywhere on my kindle or phone I can't stop playing-
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|the graphics i. this game are really good! the control can be a little bit hard to use at times if it was me i would replace the tapping feature with maby a directional pad like in age of zombies and a button to hit with. i would also like to see maby a way to buy the uru with the gold coins you get so you don't have to spend ridiculous amounts of money trying to get yourself to a moderate power level. other than that its a really solid game and i would recommend it to any Thor fans out there!
1451666179|5.0|This book had me laughing till I cried; in fact my sides hurt!  Although I had seen some of these stories on Allie's blog they continue to amuse and the expansion of the Goose story was superb.<br /><br />Her more poignant entries regarding depression are funny and sad and the hot sauce story sounds like something from my own childhood.<br /><br />I wish Allie nothing but the best of health and continued success and I hope for a sequel someday!
161655164X|5.0|This concept art book is beyond good. It clearly explains the reasoning behind the looks of the characters and the images are amazing.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|So happy to have found this item at such a great price, definitely something I have been wanting to get for myself.
0345803485|5.0|i love this book... i gave you 5 stars because you deserve it.... all my family is wanting to read it so i bet you will be getting more orders..
B008XG1X18|5.0|Did an update this week. I prefer interest on my kindle  I love the tabs  added to scan related pins. I love now that you can see the last pin as the current pin category. My 3 year old granddaughter love's to Pin Sofia the First and other Disney related  pins like a pro. I think it's just fine the way it is.
0321934318|5.0|Scott writes so anyone can understand. I have all his books and refer to them often. Photography made easier to process.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Richard Gere's best performance and he couldn't have played the part without Hachi. A heartbreaking tale to indulge in the joy of sweet sorrow.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This story takes the racial issues from the kitchen (the help) into the court room with so many twists that I could not read another thing for hours after I finished it. It was personal, timely, exciting and only something John Grisham could write. It was like living in a small Mississippi town and knowing almost everyone in town. I would give this book 10 stars.
B009AMALLM|3.0|This was not done the same way as the other movies. I do not like the direction this series is going. I will not watch any more.
B008NAFU9A|3.0|While the author has an interesting premise with this new twist on vampire lore, this particular &#34;book&#34; is more of a short story than a novel and leaves you feeling abruptly abandoned when you get to the last page. It wasn't badly written, just rushed at the end as if she needed to stick to a word count - however it was still enjoyable so I gave it three stars.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|fabulous, fun novel- I loved the imagery and the plot and hope to see more from this author!  you will get drawn into the world<br />created and not want to leave!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Such a great book - I laughed so much in some parts that my sides hurt. Definitely one to keep in the rotation of regular reads!
B00A2H9X6I|5.0|Much better than the original, in terms of sticking to the book, and being creative and going in its own direction.  It's psychologically mind blowing.  Because you're so implanted within Carrie's mind, you'll end up rooting for her during the prom scene
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Still one of my favorite shows on TV.  I have re-watched these episodes over and over, and still fun to watch!
B001EYU1VO|1.0|Although these days a $60 joystick is considered &#34;budget&#34;, even a &#34;budget&#34; joystick needs to function properly. The wide range of adjustments available to the stick is an excellent idea, but to work well Mad Catz would need to invest more in quality design and quality control. When the stick first arrived, I loosened the stick to adjust the tilt per the instructions, but afterwards it would not lock into place again. I returned the stick to Mad Catz for repair, but it returned with even more problems. The tilt adjustment worked, but the 8-way hat only recognized up/down. Button 2 no longer worked, the stick only recognized half of the range of motion to the left, and moving the joystick fully to the left rendered all the buttons inoperable. I contacted Mad Catz notifying them of the additional issues, but they did not reply.<br /><br />The stick looks good on paper, but given these poor quality issues, I recommend you look elsewhere.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Is very funny and pretty. I  like this game. When i saw it, the scream picture was so childly but when i started yo play i had too much fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham creates the best characters!  He makes me feel as if I know them personally.  I liked it so much I didn't want it to end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story. Mad at myself for watching movie first. Can not wait to read the other two! Such an awesome book.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I love this movie. There's a lot of haters out there, who want to nit-pick the soul from this film, but frankly, I really liked it.<br />The actors are great, the score is phenomenal, the script is great, the plot is intriguing. It pays homage to the Donner Superman films from the 70s, while still setting up it's own mythology.<br />The action is breathtaking, and fast-paced - exactly what a Superman movie should be!<br />I saw it in theaters in normal 3D, and IMAX 3D. I don't think 3D added too much to this film, to be honest.<br /><br />As for the bluray: the extras were neat! I liked the visual commentary that they had on the bonus disc. Too me, there can never be too many extras.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|love the pixstar movies!  great story. I got it for my granddaughter, but I confess, I enjoyed it just as much.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This CD, Susan's second holiday effort is better than the first. On &#34;The Gift,&#34; Susan sounded like she was straining her voice. On this CD, she sounds more natural. Also, ALL the songs on this CD are holiday related, whereas &#34;The Gift&#34; had a couple of non-holiday songs. All of the songs here are great but the standout is her duet with Elvis on &#34;O Come All Ye Faithful.&#34; I predict this song will become a holiday staple on the radio for years to come, much like &#34;Little Drummer Boy&#34; by Bing and David Bowie.<br /><br />Little Drummer Boy on this CD sounds fresh and new, especially with the bagpipes. Susan teams up for Johnny Mathis for &#34;When a Child is Born,&#34; a song Johnny has recorded solo and with Gladys Knight. Susan and Johnny play off each other well. Each song on this CD holds up on its own. Susan has one of those voices that comes across as sincere and powerful. This CD Is a MUST GET for your holiday collection.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Great movie, as all the pixstars are!  my grandchild really loves it, and I confess,  I do too! Great story line, Reasonable price
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush! I just started playing yesterday and I couldn't stop playing...that was until my kindle died on me. this is a great game for all ages as well. my kids love it to.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This book held my interest although I don't understand why anyone would want to take on a journey like this woman did.  It was a very different sort of book for me to read, and I hope the main character found her way to whatever she was searching for within herself in the end.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Most of the low ratings seem to be criticisms related to poor editing.  However, now that Penguin has picked the book up, I noted this is no longer an issue.  The story is well-written and reminds me of some of Steven Erickson's novels -- less complicated in writing style and not quite as imaginative, but still very enjoyable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game everyday religiously. The colors are bright. It's a great time killer on the bus or train. Really simple to play but expect difficulty the farther you get.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|Children of Men, directed by Alfonso Cuarón and released in 2006, was simultaneously beautiful and unsettling. The movie immediately places us in Britain 2027 when the youngest person on the planet, 18 years old, has just died. We learn that all women suddenly became infertile 18 years prior, subsequently causing all nations besides Britain to crumble. This apocalyptic world is rife with war, racism, poverty, and a devastatingly low chance of anyone surviving, let alone reproducing. As the only nation left standing, and barely at that, Britain has placed extreme and immediate deportation laws on all immigrants. Our hero, Theo, must leave his complacent but depressing routine in this world once he is suddenly asked by his ex-lover to help him get a “foogie,” or refugee, across the border. He eventually obliges and is tasked with helping get a pregnant African-American immigrant named Kee to the safety of a humanist group called “the Human Project.” This complicated task becomes more difficult with every trying attempt to cross such a controlled and dangerous border.<br /><br />Throughout the movie there is a significant amount of religious symbolism and implicit political opinion. The film gave the viewers a glimpse into what a world without children can be, and tied it to the world we currently live in and how our societal norms and political values are what caused it. Amazingly enough, the movie still remains focused and true to the plot of saving Kee and refrains from abrasively stating political opinions. The opinions are masked beautifully, but still very obvious given the destruction of the land as a result of political choice and action in response to a given issue. The director made many cinematographic choices that allowed the movie to resemble a documentary, making it feel more real and thus slightly more upsetting. Even the action and characters are more believable than many current sci-fi or political movies. Our hero certainly has similarities to a savior, but is not meant to seem perfect or miraculous. Similarly, the action itself never had close ups, nor did it seem unrealistic or fake. All of the action resembled believable war tactic along with the actions of desperate and hopeless people. There was no person attempting to fight terrorists with their hands, just simply a world where no one wanted to live, but no one could stand the thought of dying either. Every aspect of the movie puts the reader in a position to truly think about what caused this apocalyptic world, and wonder whether or not our world is truly headed in the same direction.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|This is, at least to me, the greatest movie ever made, and that includes the stuff that's put out in movie theaters today. This should be required viewing for everybody.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Seems to take a lot of time to wade through everything.Since it was free, I can't complain but.I don't know that I'd pay for this game.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|The game isn't all that fun to play I downloaded it for the free coin offer and did t get those either total sham.  I really can't recommend downloading this game for any reason.
B003B02O0A|5.0|If I could have given a higher rating I would have. A first rate book. Graham 's best. Thank you.
B0045MRLCE|5.0|I love it, it do easy to have ready to play and it sound great, the band perry rocks try it
1577314808|5.0|This not only enters your mind but goes to a further place - your heart. It changes the way I think so that I don't ignore who I am. I had to read pages over again to allow myself to understand what Eckhart Tolle was saying and let the words change me.
B008J8KBKY|5.0|Very challenging and graphics are beautiful. I would highly recommend this game to others who wish to have a game to play while waiting on things.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I absolutely loved this book. Just couldn't put it down. The three star review? The ending...or lack thereof. It's not that this book's ending was horrible, it just didn't have one. Literally. It ended the way most chapters would, where you're thinking &#34;omg, what is going to happen next??&#34;, then.. 27 pages of the author thanking everybody who helped her work on this book. I've never been so confused by something so simple. It wasn't even written like it was set up for a sequel, it just ... freaking ... stopped. It's almost laughable. The rest of the book was great. Wonderfully written. But based on the fact that it's unfinished, I'd get my money back if I could. Who knew you could get to the end of a book and actually be mad. Oh well, if it doesn't bother you, go for it.<br /><br />&#34;I have nothing left to say&#34;....
B0026127Y8|5.0|Great action film with enough story to justify the action. Liam Neeson is great as the father in pursuit of his daughter. highly recomend to ther viewers.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Always more on target against other apps. Especially nimble in moving among stored cities, quite helpful when traveling or trip planning. Gives excellent detail in forecasts.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Imagine my surprise when I powered through five lengthy books to see what happened at the end, only to find out that the last two books are not even done yet! What an absolute let down. I don't even know I will read the last two (if and when) they actually come out. I am sure I will have forgotten everything by then.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Bought this album for my Father-in-law. He's never heard the Lumineers before, but I love them! All their songs are awesome.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Some incredible advice in this wonderful, easy, fun read! Needed an attitude change and James' words gave me tons of inspiration to finally make it happen and turn things around!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book! Helped me and my husband understand each other so much better. I still go back and read parts of it every so often.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An incredible book about the dedication and sacrifice of our nations elite warriors. I could not put the book down, and I thought about it constantly for weeks after I finished the book. All American citizens owe these patriots a debt of gratitude.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this album! Wonderful music as always. Bought it for my father-in-law for Christmas, he's going to love it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, surprises, have to think to clear the jelly in # of moves. Just wish could get more lives with out paying for them.
B006VRDZ44|5.0|I think that this has been one of the best period flick this 21st century. The storyline, images and the characters are just extraordinary.
0142501123|5.0|Beautiful art work. This is a sweet book that will help kids learn about sharing and caring for others. I like that its written so EVERYONE is included. I recommend this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John green writes like no other author I've ever read. If you don't cry, you reading it wrong, trust me. Gus, hazel, and Isaac will become your best friends and give you hope. I know that's what they've become to me.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|These movies are presented the way they originally came out in theaters.  Other reviews point out that styles have changed since the originals hit the big screen.  Wonderful job of restoration.
B008BZIUHG|5.0|Rival Sons is the best new band I have had the pleasure to listen to. I hope they get some recognition for the great voice.
B00CWIMY3O|3.0|As you know Manhunter started the profiler/serial killer genre. The genre took off after The Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately with tv shows such as CSI franchise, Criminal Minds, Bones,Dexter, The Following. British shows Waking the Dead, Wire in the Blood etc. It seems as if this show looks like its catching up and aping the genre technically it started.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Loved the blog and loved the book. I don't buy many books but as soon as I saw this, I didn't even have to think about it. Bought it right away and wasn't disappointed!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Oh my God I totally loved this movie, can't wait for the next one. Thor is so awesome and totally hot!!!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|When I first got this app, it worked any place I was. Now, however, it only works when I am actually connected via wifi. The game itself is very nice, but the portability is disappointing.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This story likely upset some.  I think the author was brave.  She had a specific story to tell and she told it her way.  She stayed true to the characters to the very end.
B00009M6VJ|5.0|Loved this movie!! Told people about it.  A Must See. Suprise twist and turns, the kind of movie you have to watch twice:)
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|I enjoyed this a lot. It's a so-so movie in terms of plot (generic recycled formula). Action was very well paced. What I really loved was that homage was well done to the genres represented. There were many points where I felt like I was watching old-school Japanese mecha or a Gamera movie, but with all the necessary modern upgrades. My heart was warmed by the dedication to Ishiro Honda at the end. Felt like respectful closure/reparation for how some of this type of material has been abused in recent movies. Great for long-time fans of the &#34;kaiju&#34;, and &#34;mecha&#34; genres represented. I'm not sure how casual viewers will like it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is amazing it is very fun, but challenging at the same time. I recommend this game if you like minecraft and it isn't so much to buy as much as some  good games so you should get this game. IT IS AN AMAZING GAME!!!!
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|Great concept... but hard to deal with in terms of travel. If I have the time to set it up, I often resort to other methods. I think it works best if you have something of a routine going.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game be careful of mobs it's just the best game I have ever played is just awesome
0811826848|5.0|6 lb. 13 oz...I read that it was big and heavy so thought you'd like to know how heavy. Size: 13.5\\" L X 10' W X 1.75\\" thick. Full of gorgeous pictures with some as big as both sides of the book. I have the DVD collection but thought this would be nice to have too. Even at the full retail price of $60, it's a bargain! It must have been very expensive to make.
B004EF65QA|5.0|A beautiful blend of skilled writing, attention to detail, and character development.. And we appreciate that the romance was appropriate and understated at the end.
1400082773|2.0|Now I know why this president hates this country so much. There is so much racism in this book it disgusts me. Then he admits to cocaine ......I'm sorry but this man has an agenda and he has a misunderstanding of the world fueled by hate and self perceived attacks against him just because he isn't all black or is too black or this or that....a whole lot of finger pointing and not enough responsibility taken on by himself
B00BXZ3D6Y|2.0|It doesn't save you just make a tape and save it you can't listen to it. No profile or place to listen to your recorded tapes.
B002MFULQO|1.0|Very interesting, provocative, fast-paced, and entertaining. Especially during the 50th Anniversary, this is a relevant movie and subject. Totally had me from the first scene.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Of course, you have to be interested in stories about lawyers, court rooms etc. Some parts were slow moving, but towards the end of the book, it picked up.
B001B1R1EU|5.0|Balsom shines on this album. She is one of he best trumpeters playing today.Aliison Balsom, Tine Helseth, Allen Vizzutti, and James Morrison are recent additions to my collection and I have never heard music I liked better. For Balsom, I llike &#34;Sound the Trumpet&#34; the best but I still love this album.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I loved Linger. At first, I was a bit thrown off by the additional points of view. I wasn’t sure I was ready to hear from Isabel or the new wolf, Cole. However, I ended up really enjoying their points of view.<br /><br />Linger was all about struggle. Something was happening with Grace, but she refused to acknowledge it. Sam was learning to live without constantly worrying about shifting, which was difficult for him. He was also learning how to be Beck and take care of other wolves. Cole was a force to be reckoned with and totally self destructive. He was struggling with being human and dealing with his human emotions when all he wanted was to escape as a wolf and forget his problems. Isabel was struggling with her family life. And Grace’s parents were a major source of conflict in Linger, which was ironic. I felt like I connected with all of the characters, even though I didn’t care for Cole at first. I never really liked Isabel, but I ended up caring a lot more about her in Linger.<br /><br /> I think Shiver works perfectly well as a stand alone novel, so I wasn’t sure what to expect from Linger. The change in tone made it a completely different reading experience, along with the added points of view, but the characters and their story definitely wasn’t over in Shiver. I liked seeing Grace and Sam together, happy, and planning for their future. I liked the new conflict involving Grace’s parents and the mystery of what was happening to her. Linger was a great sequel because it was different, but also very much a continuation of the story.<br /><br /> I highly recommend Linger, the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy so far, and continuing the series after Shiver. Maggie Stiefvater has a magical way of writing. I wouldn’t say Linger was sad and, in many ways, the tone is much brighter than Shiver. For some reason, however, moments in Linger really hit me and I struggled not to cry (and failed). It really takes a lot to get me emotional like that in a book. I am such a huge fan of the author and her ability to write and get me to care about characters I never thought I’d like. This is a must read series, whether it’s the first one you pick up from the author or one you’ve circled back to like I did.<br /><br /> Hilarious Observation: Grace’s parents seem to have major issues with Sam and think he’s corrupting their daughter and I just think it’s hilarious because Sam is so sensitive and sweet and poetic. I mean, there’s nothing wrong with sensitive dudes, it’s just that he’s so over the top and he’s certainly not the type of guy you’d accuse of corrupting anyone’s virtue. Which only proves how totally clueless Grace’s parents are about her life. I just find this whole conflict hilarious.am such a huge fan of the author and her ability to write and get me to care about characters I never thought I’d like.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Clear, concise.  Thorough.  There's a lot more to it than I thought  -  one does not just load 'er up!  Appreciated the non-techie language!
0545259088|5.0|I love this series. I love Forever. I love Maggie Stiefvater. And I love how often tears formed in my eyes and how often I smiled and ached and yet, this is not a sad story. It’s just emotional. And Forever was perhaps my favorite book in the trilogy. It was beautiful and tragic and hopeful.<br /><br /> I don’t think I can do this series justice by talking about it. I feel like there are so many things to be analyzed and discussed. Not only is the writing style worth discussing, but nearly every aspect of the story is, as well. The wolves and everything about how their pack worked is worth discussing. The relationship between Sam and Grace, the way they compliment and complete each other despite their obvious differences is another thing worth discussing. The way that Maggie Stiefvater created a love story that represents the kind of love that should be respected, admired, and attained just makes my heart melt. The relationships between Sam and Beck, Sam and his biological parents, Isabel and her parents, and Grace and her parents are all different, complicated, and I could probably spend hours discussing what those differences are and why each of those relationships are significant and what they mean for the growth and well being of a child. Cole and his own struggle with his past was complicated and interesting. The relationship between Cole and Isabel was significant, too. And that is not all worth discussing. How would I even begin?<br /><br /> The books in the series aren’t very long, but they are the kind of books I sort of fell into and lingered inside of. It took me far longer to finish the series than it should have based on page number, interest, and my reading speed. But the way it was formatted had me stopping and thinking and the writing style forced to me slow my reading speed to some degree. To me, these are good things. I spent enough time in the books and I am glad the author was able to make the books feel longer in a positive way.<br /><br /> The emotions rolling through me while reading Forever were all over the place. I was full of hope, anger, sadness, happiness, love, concern, angst, fear, worry, satisfaction, anticipation, and a handful of other emotions. It was the kind of book that had me crying, though I couldn’t quite figure out why I was so emotional when nothing bad was happening. It was the kind of book that just demands emotional investment.<br /><br /> I highly recommend the series. I thought I’d only mildly enjoy it and if I’m being honest, I wasn’t drawn to the books at all. They didn’t sound very good. If you strip the plot down and tell someone what it’s about, it almost sounds dumb. It certainly could have been terrible quite easily. But it was magical and amazing and profound. I am such a huge fan of Maggie Stiefvater and this series is perhaps the greatest example of why she’s amazing. I’m not sure it is my favorite work of hers, but it was certainly the most surprising.
0307943194|5.0|Bought it to replace an abridged copy from my local library (lost 1 disc, still haven't found it).

B000WMFZMY|5.0|It is amazing how this story could be told when the only real source is an epic poem \\"El Poema del Cid\\".  That said and I will have to agree that the writers of the movie did a marvelous job in revealing this story of medieval Spain.  It is true that in those days there were Moslems that fought for their land(Spain) at the expense of their religion.  Would that be the case today.<br />Heston does a remarkable jpb in the title role and Sophia does well with the part she is given.  Great entertainment with a glimpse of history.

B000F7CMQ8|5.0|The pairing of Clark Gable and Ava Gardner is classic.  The 2 (arguably) top screen idols of their day and then the addition of a new young thing...Grace Kelly and the color and mystery of the African jungle and you have the makings of a legendary movie.<br />This is one I can watch time after time.  Gardner was never so gorgeous, Gable so full of testosterone and Kelly so innocent,

B004JHYRP4|5.0|An extremely well told tale consisting of three parts.  Part 1 is in our universe when a new power source is discovered.  Part 2 in a parallel universe (this part is exceptional) where the problem with the power source is realized.  Part 3 in our universe where the solution of the problem is discovered.  Extremely entertaining and well written.
B00C1040TO|5.0|I am not a professional by any means but we just had our piano tuned this week. My wife is working with our kids to learn some basics so they put stickers on all the keys to show what note they are. I got this app and sat down with my daughter. Every key she would play was instantly displayed on my phone, even when she played them quickly. That is a very impressive bit of programming and well worth paying for if you want to be able to see if an instrument is in tune and make adjustments.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Albert King and Jimi Hendrix were huge influences on SRV.  Stevie borrowed heavily from both, but forged his own unique sound.  It's great seeing AK, a musical father, being honored by his devoted son, SRV.  You can feel the love! Unbelievable guitar blues, a tribute to two of the best.  A must have if you dig blues guitars that sound more like human voices than musical instruments.  In fact, that's what Albert, Jimi, and Stevie share -- they all transcend the limits of their instruments, and plug-in directly to their souls.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Excellent quality, Awesome, as discribed, quick ship good seller, would reccomend.  It's an awesome flick, what else is there to say; get your's today!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it is fun and it is also challenging . There is do much you can do with this game or should I say games.  (LOLZ!!!!!) XD I think if you don't get this game you sick/stink or both.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This may be Woody Allen's most charming film. Combine a simple story that includes a mysterious midnight portal from the present to the Paris of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein and the eternal city of light lovingly photographed by a master and you have a can't lose motion picture. I never tire of watching this one, or of the film's message--that one must follow one's dream without compromise. This is a beauty!<br /><br />--Robert McDowell, author of Poetry as Spiritual Practice and The More We Get Together: The Sexual and Spiritual Language of Love [...]
B005K17RU0|2.0|Even when I hit the refresh button, it does not show me current weather reports.  For example, today is Thursday.  My app has been &#34;stuck&#34; on Monday since Monday morning.  If I select a new location it will be current, but I have to delete my current location and add it back to get today's weather report - even after hitting the refresh button.

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This movie is all right. This move scared me little.  It is a true story.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is the best game. I loved playing it on Facebook. If you like these kinds of games you have to play this. It will a game that you will want to play forever.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Well Done!  This is a wonderful movie that is not only entertaining but thought provoking and provides valuable information about our food supply.
B00ADQPB50|4.0|It's a continuing story with some of the same characters going further into the store line of unusual demonic and horror in a mental hospital
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I love this CD!  Although this is considered music for children, the music is uplifting and happy to the point that I listen to it frequently.  Simply wonderful.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|It's a continuing story about horror and unexplained happenings and ungodly things that are going on in this mental hospital
B005USZML4|5.0|Great like all his books. It is interesting reading about a kid solving crimes. Reminds me of Nancy Drew. I'm going to read all in this series.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Sometimes the extra moves don't work but other than that this is a game the whole family has fun playing this a great game.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|This show is amazing, the actors are wonderful, stories engagaing, and its creepy, nastly, disturbing, and thought provoking.  I woudl be surpsrised to hear that the cast, crew, writers, and support crew were not in therapy after making this show.  Yes, I am hooked, amazed, schocked, and repulsed and can't wait for the second season
B000641ZA4|2.0|The sound quality of this dvd is terrible. The sound level goes up and down throughout the entire video. Very annoying!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing with many surprise twists that will blow you away (especially the last sentence in the book). Warning for young children: much, much, much, much, much DEATH
B006OCM0G0|5.0|One of the first apps I got on the kindle.  Great app, loads of decorating and farming fun. You will like it, definitely worth trying.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Perfect movie for a girls night. Love all the little snarkey comments and jokes hidden. Great movie! Watched it back to back the first night I got it!
B009LHWEKW|3.0|My wife loves this show. I think that it is very interesting that the two leads at some point in their lives expressed belief in God and Christ. Now that they have been doing this show, neither of them express that view anymore. Even Mark Shepard (Satan on this show and Jacob on LOST) believed in Christ. As a believer myself, I find the shows view that God, Satan, Angels and Demons are all the same. All are manipulative and have a jealousy/hatred of humans. This show doesn't affect my faith, but I feel dirty after watching it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was not familiar with William Landay before ordering this amazing book. I'll be reading everything else he has written. I was mesmerized from start to finish. It's a riveting read, both due to the story itself as well as Landay's writing style. You are kept wondering about the outcome every step of the way. The interspersed conversations between the prosecutor and Andy puts you even more on edge, makes you know that there is more to come than whether Jacob is guilty or not guilty. You cannot possibly imagine the ending - which haunts me to this day. WAS Jacob guilty? And it's not just the question you'll ask about the death of the young boy. The brief interactions between Andy and his father is raw, very well done. I cannot say enough good things about this book. Read it, you will not be disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After reading Divergent ravenously and then Insurgent a bit less so, this was such a let down!  I stopped reading it twice to read other books.  I forced myself to finish it only to be utterly disappointed in the end.  Just ugh!
B00008OE4W|5.0|I LOVE this older movie...lots of good actors, with a drama-comedy-romantic touch to it. It is entertaining from beginning to end. It's actually one of my all-time favorites.
B0089LOG02|5.0|excellent book. I usually hate a heavy use of flashbacks, but here it works perfectly. They are not intrusive, but add texture to the present-day chapters. I was drawn into the story right away. A very interesting story.
B00C1040TO|5.0|this app looks great works great and has a variety of features. Blah blah. All you need to know is it can hear anything around you and tell you the closest note and how many cents away from it being exactly that note. This is going to change my life.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Funny, enjoyable, and a quirky take on the idea behind Paris Je Taim, New York I Love You, Conception, and others. I always like this kind of movie. I really liked the part with the guy's club.
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|Bought this to repaint as a pirate prop for Halloween. The holster works fantastically and I almost went with the stock paint job because it worked so well. Almost. Modifiers be warned, make sure your paints dry very slick or you will lose some of the quick draw from the holster. The factory settings on this blaster are great and it is easily a favorite. The hammer actually being used to prime the blaster is super cool and it fires exceedingly well.
068981528X|5.0|Loved it when I was little. Is still just as good. I buy it when ever someone has a kid. Every child needs this heart warming and adventurous tail (or tale)
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this song and was hoping the rest of the album would take a similar direction. Sadly, this was the best song of the new bunch for my tastes. Your mileage may vary of course, but I did find this to be more of an extemporaneous piece than than the rest of the ARTPOP album which mostly seemed forgettable.
B00003XACV|5.0|Wonderful sound track directly from the movie. I created a playlist that includes other Thomas Newman pieces that I listen to at bedtime.
B00322PK2G|2.0|Ticking is very loud on this watch, and I think it would drive me crazy.  Not sure this watch is any better quality than the $10 ones.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book hasn't left me even though it has been months since I read it. No one can imagine what life is really like for the North Koreans. This is a book I would have handed around and am sorry I can't because it is in my Kindle.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Captivating. Could not put this book down! Great author great book. I will read another by this author. Recommend to anyone who enjoys winding tails of love and life..
0345803485|1.0|Plain and simple, lots of sex, no true character development or story and terrible editing. It makes me sad that this literature is on our shelves and that people are buying it!  I made it to chapter 2 and gave up, wishing I could get back all that precious time reading that crap!  There is beautiful beautiful literature out there.....read it! :)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Any fan of The Shining will be happy to find out what happens to Danny Torrance. Maybe not happy, but at least, very satisfied. King's fascination with hotels (see also The Talisman), the power of residual emotions, the unusual power of the mind, and his references to pop culture make Doctor Sleep a frightening journey you can't help but enjoy.
B000XBYU4S|5.0|I had this album years ago and was just as good as I remember.  Nice ambient music for relaxing or playing in the background during conversations or when your reading or anything else.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Lots of fun. Wish there were more ways to earn crowns without having to use actual money to buy them. Kinda stuck farming now, but still can't stop playing.

B000MD9UJC|1.0|Worst purchase ever, did not fit the mini mag-lite, and the instructions were unintelligible. Absolutely the worst thing I ever bought on Amazon.
0321934946|5.0|We had the 1st Edition, which we misplaced.  When we tried to purchase the 1st edition, i told my husband to try the 2nd edition, which included a lot of updated information that was very helpful.  Very happy with this purchase.
1400049628|5.0|Great book about natural disaster preparedness, Smart Ideas and good tips for Natural disasters or the &#34;Zombie&#34; outbreak.<br />from storing food to useful items to keep close at hand.
B00GQ7PILC|2.0|This season was definitely disappointing, note there will be SPOILERS!<br /><br />What makes this season a dud, is for a series finale it lacks the conviction to focus and conclude the characters story in a meaningful way, it was wrought with silly story tangents that didn't really add much depth and only wasted time to conclude the story or add character depth to the primary characters.<br /><br />The driving underlying conflict was never about the serial killers, that was a typical formula that all crime series always conclude, the bad guy gets caught or dies. But the primary conflict that this series had never addressed, only with Deb and Sgt. Doax was Dexter's hidden life and the tension of it being revealed. Instead Season 8 revolves too much on the brain surgeon killer story which probably happens to be the most uninteresting killer ever. He isn't even revealed until near the end of the season, which creates a bland killer that really never had any interesting character development to him, the way the Ice truck or Trinity Killer did in previous seasons.<br /><br />Then the addition of Zack, Dexter's possible pupil was cut short, when he was killed, I actually thought that could have been a plausible story line to grow on, again just wastes time to develop and conclude the older characters. Dr. Vougel is an interesting character, she adds depths to Dexter's origin as the author of the code which he always thought was from Harry. But midway in the story her irrational maternal instincts to save her lost son who happens to be the brain surgeon, ends up costing her life, again another story plot that just wastes time which should have been all focused on Dexter's instead.<br /><br />The return of Hannah i actually liked, but again wasn't developed enough, she is a believable complement to Dexter, she really isn't a disturbed serial killer, just a pragmatic woman, that believes killing as a natural instinct to preserve herself or her loved ones. Her story line being chased by authorities was a good plot that should have been more intertwined earlier in the season.<br /><br />And yes, Deb..she is definitely one of my favorite characters, and i have no problem with her death :( But its just the way it happened didn't seem so meaningful or worthy of a finale. I understand and accept these characters are cops and they live in a dangerous world, where death is a close reality, but to have her die in a coma/stroke from the shot that Dexter could have prevented if he killed the surgeon on the spot, almost makes you mad at Dexter instead! Deb should have died heroically like saving Harrison by jumping in front of a bullet, yes its cliche, but would have been fitting and believable in her line of work.<br /><br />Personally i'll sum up the way season 8 &#34;should have been&#34; ideally presented, was to be more like season 2 where Dexter's identity is discovered right from the beginning of the season and the authorities go on a wild goose chase. Dexter becomes an outlaw on the run, then Deb and Dr. Vougel become his eyes/help to escape, while they take care of Harrison. Then rather than having the brain surgeon as the main enemy, the FBI, authorities and a super smart/tough but corrupt bounty hunter kinda like a super Lundy/Doax chase after Dexter. Midway he runs into Hanna and Zack, they help, he teaches the code to help shape Zack as a new avenger. Then as the story concludes  and the chase gets closer to Dexter, somewhere in the gunfire Deb blocks a bullet from hitting Harrison saving him, but she dies heroically. Dexter is caught but Hanna and Harrison escape to Argentina. While Dexter is being transported by authorities the hurricane escalates causing their van to careen off a cliff and into the ocean where Dexters' body isn't found. One year passes and show a killer escape on a technicality, but is caught by Zack who becomes the new Dexter. And as the final scene, showing Hanna and Harrison in some little beach cottage in Argentina, the door opens and a shadowy silhouette casts on Harrisons' smiling face..&#34;assuming its Dexter&#34;  :)

Drawing with shapes in step by sep picture directions are easy for even toddlers to follow along. Make a world shows them how to make buildings, cars, people, animals, planes, trains, and more. There are some repeats from other Ed Emberley books, but my kids never seem to mind. These are even fun for adults.

B00CA4S47A|4.0|The lyricality of Emeli Sande's Version of Events is refreshing. Lyrically and melodically Emeli Sande's versions of songs are full of intelligence and insightful messages. It's wonderful when modern albums are also released on VINYL and Ms. Sande's version of soul singing lends itself well to this format. Its always interesting when a commercially \\"beautiful\\" face is not displayed on an album. Some Covers are elevated to the level of ART when on a 12\\" Vinyl.

It was released as a standalone single and as part of the She EP which contained three other songs (\\"Like the Morning Dew\\", \\"Can't Live With the World\\" and \\"Jump Right Out\\"). \\"She\\" was re-released as an EP containing a new \\"2013 Edit\\" of the song and five other remixes.<br /><br />\\"That's Alright\\" is a modern-day anthem that revels in being different from the commercialized \\"ideal.\\"<br /><br />It's wonderful when NEW albums are also released in a VINYL format.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is so addictive and so much fun. I haven't been able to put it down since I downloaded it!
B00CRPZXFI|3.0|Baz Luhrman expressed his desire to blend the music of the Jazz Age associated with the 1922 setting of The Great Gatsby with a modern spin. Much like his modern twists wonderfully applied in Romeo + Juliet, Baz uses GATSBY's music prominently in the foreground, which takes on a character of its own.<br /><br />This version of  F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby's Soundtrack is a MAJOR part of the film. But the musical mash up concept of this soundtrack is sometimes hit & miss. \\"Young and Beautiful\\" performed by Lana Del Rey sounds neither \\"Young\\" nor \\"Beautiful.\\" Beyonc&eacute; haunting vocal sounds beautiful on the cover of Mark Ronson & Amy Winehouse's \\"Back to Black\\" but Andr&eacute; 3000 seems out of place. Emeli Sand&eacute;'s cover of Rich Harrison & Beyonc&eacute;'s \\"Crazy in Love\\" sounds uninspired. \\"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)\\" is gloriously performed by Fergie but Q-Tip, GoonRock and the tempo changes within the song are distracting.  will.i.am's \\"Bang Bang\\" is a bit much (as he often is).,<br /><br />It's wonderful when modern albums are also released in a VINYL format. Vinyl is the perfect format for a 1920s period soundtrack.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Was looking for a game to keep me interested and have fun with and I did. Love the cute little characters.
B007PVHANM|3.0|Being that there have been so many documentaries about Bob Marley, MARLEY had an impossible task of having to deliver something new. Although brought worldwide attention to Jamaican culture, Reggae music and the Rastafari movement. Although Bob had a total of eleven children with seven women, the less-famous mothers and children of Bob's life seems to have been greatly underplayed in this film. MARLEY does deliver fascinating insights into Bob's compound and goes in depth about his illness & cancer treatments.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A quick read, it had me not wanting to put it down. Dark, thrilling and very beautifully written. I would recommend this book who enjoys a little history, fantasy and some scariness as well :). Bravo, Riggs!
B00CM1S1JW|5.0|Rapture is a modern classic album. Its legend that Ms. Baker's GRAMMY Award winning breakthrough (second) album inspired (and influenced the signing of) Mary J. Blige and Toni Braxton. It's wonderful when albums with iconic covers are also released in a VINYL format. Ms. Baker's warm vocals and music are perfectly suited for vinyl. Some Covers are elevated to the level of ART when on a 12\\" Vinyl album.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book, very original. Especially for a zombie book. The form really draws you in and the pages flip by without you hardly noticing!
B00713WA7K|5.0|Maxinquaye is 1 of 2 favorite TRICKY albums [Pre-Millennium Tension is the other favorite]. The dark, rich and layered muscal soundscape, the moody vibe, free-form atmosphere, the juxtaposition of the counterbalance of TRICKY & Martina Topley-Bird voices - all work. It's wonderful when modern albums are also released in a VINYL format. The BACK cover is UPside-DOWN?
B005D9MUWY|2.0|This app works for most if the time, except for Facebook in which the auto completion and corection systems are completely broken and make typing a simple message an absolute chore.<br /><br />I use Facebook for work and I find myself reverting back to the default Android keyboard all the time in order to be able to type consistently.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to see this game now on the Amazon Appstore.  Downloaded the day it came out and well, have not stopped playing!  Thank you Amazon!
1250038820|5.0|I”'ve come to know about this work, specially the book, by a full page reporting in an important newspaper from Brasil.<br /><br />The images had such a strength, that I immediatly went to Amazon's page and ordered the book.<br /><br />Well, it arrived today and having the book in hands is such an incredible experience. I mean, the images, printed, are so beatiful and full of emotion, that it surprised me again.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />As an amateur photographer, I think portrait is the most noble (and the most difficult) kind of pictures to make. Precisely because it's so “invasive” and the subjects must permit this “invasion” of the lens. It's kind of seduction the photographer must do, to get the cumplicity of the subject. And the author did it so well!!!<br /><br />It comes out of the photos the relationship the author got with those people (and those animals, too).<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />And the photos are touching precisely because of that; because of the human relationship (even with the dogs) that we can feel between Brandon and them.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The love the author has for what he chose to do goes to his subjects and reach who see these photos.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />And that's what art and people are about: love!”
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love the graphics and reminders when my crafts are done. I would definitely recommend it! Thanks for making it for the kindle!
0307271609|4.0|A good addition to the small body of work covering the career of the Empress Cixi.  I had previously read Sterling Seagrave's 'Dragon Lady' which, like this book, gives a more nuanced view of a much maligned character in late Chinese history.  Like Seagrave's book, Jung Chang attempts to provide a more balanced view of the Empress acknowledging her crimes but also discussing her achievements.  The book is well researched and worth a read.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very good job Zanga. Smooth running and very high graphics.  Wish you all would get your farm Ville 2 where it played this good on the computer.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter turned me on to this game and it has been an addictive time waster for all those long waits and trips.
B00BFV1K0M|4.0|Not quite as good as the first but I still loved it. It was a bit slow to start but really picks up around the half way point. I can't wait to read mockingjay now.
B00EPZEU70|5.0|I've owned the mini 7s, 210 and the mini 25. I love the instant gratification but was frustrated over the limited capabilities. I just got my Mini 90 and I LOVE it. The features are great, the modes are so helpful, there's a macro setting and the battery is rechargeable (used to be a hassle to run and get new batteries every time). I highly recommend this model If you don't have an instax yet, get this one.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I've watched this DVD multiple times and always find something I've missed. I've been on sick leave and this has helped me through!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Definitely the book that causes people to laugh out loud in public to the point of tears every 5 ,minutes. Definitely recommend for everyone that needs a good lovey-dovey comedy book at the moment!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I love this book and the illustrations were a nice surprise.  It's good to read Doyle's stories before seeing the many TV and movie adaptations.  I'm only about 1/4 of the way through.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Excellent game.  Lots of rooms.  Also has slot machines.  You're able to give and receive gifts to help you advance in levels.  The graphics are good.  The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is the occasional tendency to freeze, which loses all the points and credits you have won and you don't get back the powerups you might have used.  Support is usually prompt about sending return emails.  You can play as your facebook avatar or can play as guest.
B004132HZS|5.0|Watched these episodes several times, alone & with others.  I absolutely love this version and think Cumberbatch's Sherlock and Freeman's Watson are the best interpretation I've seen.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Great album.  I love Alan Jackson and really enjoy his music and the stories each song relays.  He enunciates each word in the song so you have no trouble understanding, and if you want to sing along, each album has the words printed within the leaflet.  Would recommend for anyone.

1492879347|5.0|Read Beyond Birkie Fever by Walter Rhein and get excited for another season of cross-country skiing.  Cross-country skiing can change a person's life and this book is a thoughtful and humorous example of showing the reader how.  Walter Rhein takes the reader on a ski tour of his personal life and his experiences involving the American Birkebeiner, or Birkie for short, North America's largest cross-country ski marathon.  The book is part history lesson, part biography, and part cultural exchange. Skiers of every level will be able to relate to the narrative as the timeline of Rhein's cross-country ski life is revealed.  The book offers novice skiers a challenge to expand their ski skills and to try citizen racing.  It invites the advanced skier to reflect on his or her own personal ski history and compare it with the author's.  Rhein points out that cross-country skiing can change people physically, mentally, and culturally.  The influences of the sport go well beyond simple recreation and racing.  It literally can enhance the quality of a person's life. In Rhein's case it helped shape him personally and vocationally.<br /><br />This book is not a how to book.  It will not give racers competitive insights for winning the Birkie.  Consult with the Italian cross-country ski team to do that.  However, it will challenge the reader to be open to training hard, to try roller skiing, to enter citizen races, to experience a World Loppet event, or simply enjoy the thrill of cross-country skiing in a foreign country for the fun of it.  People who cross-country ski are some of the most interesting people on the planet.  Meeting some of the characters in Beyond Birkie Fever will inspire cross-country skiers to get out on a ski trail to experience their own adventures.  This book is an excellent early ski season read, it will make you laugh, and it will inspire you to cross-country ski.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|My first Zynga game for my kindle.  It's fun.  I actually think I like it better than the online version.  There's a little mystery to it even.
B00846REIS|5.0|I wouldn't recommend reading this right after Fifty Shades.  It does have a lot of the same &#34;feel&#34; to it.  With that being said....IT IS WRITTEN BY AN AUTHOR WHO KNOWS HOW TO WRITE.  I loved Fifty Shades with the rest of the world...but come on, it was very poorly written and very redundant.  This book gets you hooked!  And it's written beautifully.  Beware...it's not a triology as originally stated.  There is a 4th book yet to be released.  I did not know this.  Wished i would have waited.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love this game! So addicting! Sure at times it's frustrating when you're stuck on a level for a month, but when you pass it finally you feel excited and accomplished. Lol.
0307474712|2.0|Could not get into this book!  And I read a lot of books made into movies but it just drug.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|I am in love with John Legend. One critique I would give is that this album seems a little more &#34;experimental,&#34; like trying different sounds than in past albums (sort of like Robert Glasper does with his Black Radio albums). But for the most part, I would say John Legend pulls it off extremely well.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|iron man isn't nearly as cool as he is in the first two movies, or in the avengers. but it;s not bad.
0385373791|5.0|I loved these books!<br />There were several times where I was so caught up with the story I had to pause for a few &#34;holy s***&#34; moments. At one point during the Death Cure I actually cried.<br />I haven't been so hooked on a series since the Hunger Games and Game of Thrones!<br />And I loved having the trilogy in one box, so I could grab the next one as soon as I was finished.
B0073COMUW|4.0|Working well so far, but time will tell if these will last as long as advertised. Nothing bad to say about these to this point.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|love the game,  but it tryst too hard to get ur money.  I am not spending cash on a game that's used more to pass time.  and is it me or is it crazy hard to beat other players with around the level?
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Frustrating at lower levels unless you have  ton of friends who also want to play also. Otherwise I enjoyed the game.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is very cool and very actions loved all characters. More actions movie.<br />Hope to see expandable 3 coming soon..

B000AJIF4E|4.0|Wonderful sound (I'm used to $10 headphones) and it's nice to be able to turn these up loud enough to not hear anything going on around you.... only problem I have with them, and for me it's a big one, is glasses. Yes, because the headphones are so big and if you have glasses, the headphones squeeze your glasses into the side of your head. It's really painful and so I can only use these when I'm not wearing my glasses.<br /><br />Maybe I don't know how to adjust them, but I've tried and tried. They're so big and heavy they just hurt too much when I'm wearing glasses.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|Didn't hate but didn't like it either...it was okay.  SPOILER.  I really didn't like many things about this movie, as many have said Jonathan Kent being a bit of a jerk not caring if Clark left his friends to drown in order to protect his secret, that was bad, also the ways Clark lets his father Jonathan go get the dog knowing full well that his dad most likely will die, really bad, he saved his little school friends but is okay with letting dear ole dad die for the dog, good job Supes.  The absolutely worse thing (at least to me) was Lois Lane, she knows his secret with ridiculous investigations and she spoke like a trucker, like &#34;are we finished measuring out d's&#34;  what the heck and so on, nothing ladylike about her as the real Lois Lane would be, tough but a lady, this was just not right, I loved that whole Lois doesn't know and Superman puts on his glasses and nobody knows, that's classic.  Now I did like some of the movie and didn't have a problem with the destruction of the property, I did have a problem with Superman not really giving a second thought to the lives that were being taken, Superman is suppose to be the &#34;boy scout&#34; superhero/moral compass of the league.  Hope they do a better story in the second movie.  I gave it 3 stars because as a stand alone movie it was just okay not a real Superman movie I'd recommend.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Very well written and researched.  . I found it fascinating to observe the cultural difference between Americans and Asian on how we treat introverts.  I think what sets Quiet: apart from other books in the genre is gave some practical exercises for both introvert and extrovert trying to communicate with introverts to engage in to facilitate communication
B004RQVVGU|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's second real album, 1981's \\"Diary Of A Madman,\\" is sure to satisfy all fans not only because it is a quality piece of heavy metal, but because it covers all of the bases: Head-banging metal, tender soft rock (read: balladry), and big riff-oriented hard rock. And furthermore, every band member turns in a top notch performance, here. The Ozzman leads the w ay with a impeccable singing, crafty vocal hooks (anthemic choruses included), and better-than-most lyricism. But Ozzy's performance behind center-mic would not be nearly as effective without the brilliant guitar work from six-string ace Randy Rhodes. This guitar god, who would actually pass away in a freak airplane crash the year following this one's release, lays the foundation for the album with crunchy licks and excellent solos.<br /><br />True, \\"D.O.A.M.\\" does, unfortunately, suffer from a case of \\"only a few songs are outstanding, and the rest of them are just okay (or good)\\" syndrome. But that certainly does not mean that there aren't standout tracks. The album's two hit singles, \\"Over The Mountain\\" and \\"Flying High Again,\\" which begin the album, are obvious highlights. The former song's propulsive drum intro, strong riffing, swinging groove, and truly irresistible chorus, make it the obvious highpoint. And a blistering, shredding solo comes screaming in, here, too. And the latter song is similar in that it, too, boasts an unforgettably catchy, sing-songy vocal refrain, but is not all about big choruses -- it, too, has another excellent, and totally air-guitar-worthy solo (this one being substantially more melodic than the one found in the first song).<br /><br />Later on come the album's three pieces of semi-obligatory, but still effective balladry, \\"You Can't Kill Rock `N' Roll,\\" \\"Tonight,\\" and the titular set closer. Of these three tracks, it is the middle one that is unquestionably the most noteworthy. \\"Tonight\\" is an emotional piece of power balladry, and one whose piano accompaniment goes really well with its already docile mood (created by placid strings, clean singing, and a melodically grumbling bass). Two solos also pepper the mix, here, with the first being of the screaming and shredding variety, and the second being a totally ripping, whammy-bar-soaked solo. With that said, though, the other two of these three ballads are not without their charm, either. \\"You Can't Kill Rock `N' Roll\\" is a gorgeous, concert-ready brooder filled with AC-DC-reminiscent lyricism (i.e. \\"Rock and roll is my religion and love\\"), lovely acoustic strumming, and squealing solos; and \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" is primarily centered around gorgeously melodic strings, although it does find a couple of blazing solos, too.<br /><br />Working your way through the rest of the record, \\"Believer\\" is highlighted by a beeping bass intro, fiery pick slide, and meaty, chugging riffs. But \\"Little Dolls\\" is an even more memorable and infectious tune, thanks to its hooky, galloping beat, and wailing, backing guitar leads. And skipping ahead a little, past the already described \\"Tonight,\\" \\"S.A.T.O.\\" gives the album a much needed little energy boost, what with its prominent, grumbling bass line, swift tempo'ing, deft guitar leads, and soloing that can, again, be only described as \\"air-guitar-able.\\" But the reissues of \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" come with one final noteworthy inclusion, a blistering live rendition of \\"I Don't Know,\\" where the band's energy (both live and otherwise) reach almost palpable levels.<br /><br />\\"Diary Of A Madman\\" is such a solid piece of work that you probably could not even tell that it, initially, was a bit of a rush-job (in order to have more live material at the ready, the OO band hurried up work on it so they could release it prior to an upcoming tour.) But do not take this fact, nor the gripe about how the truly amazing epics are seldom found, here, too seriously, because this is a very good album. It all makes for one other essential purchase from John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne, the irrefutable king of heavy metal music.\\" Osbourne, the irrefutable king of heavy metal music.
1603090002|2.0|I think this was an attempt at a musical, graphic novel. There was a LOT of singing, which is funny because you can't actually hear it. But they were singing what was going on in the story. Walking through the chaos. There really didn't seem to be much plot to this. I enjoyed the prose pieces at the end much more than the graphic novel section which seemed to be a mere setup for future adventures (a new villain?).
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Hey, I read the book when young so I have been a fan for years and feel that I am finally getting to see the story brought to life and it helps that the director is also a big fan.
0765356139|4.0|This was the test. Now that you're not &#34;wowed&#34; by the uniqueness of the magic system and since the first book had a lot of closure was this book going to be just filler living off the reputation of its predecessor?<br /><br />The answer for me was no. Same lovable cast of characters and they're evolving (which is good. Lots of (alemantic) action, and the characters constantly in sticky situations. Then there's the overall mystery of the well of ascension and the hero of ages. It all works for me.<br /><br />It's not my favorite kind of fantasy (see China Mieville for that) but I do like it a lot. The narrator is also great on this one. He does different voices for all the characters and it really makes it fun to listen too.<br /><br />So I guess I'll get to The Hero of Ages sometime this year to finish off the trilogy.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We have seen this movie a few times and we all love it from I (51 years old) to my 6 year old daughter.  So glad to finally own it which will be the case when it is unwrapped on Christmas Eve.
0786939532|2.0|Reading this with my 13-year-old. So far this book seems really clunky. I remember enjoying a couple of Salvatore's other FR books and this is supposed to be a classic so I hope it gets better.<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br /><br />I'm not impressed. This just wasn't that much fun. I have enjoyed some of Salvatore's other books so I'm wondering if they get better once Drizzt leaves Menzobarranzan? It wasn't terrible, just clunky and kind of boring. Maybe I just expected more because of the hype. My son did eventually read the next book and said he liked it better.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Bought for a gift for a friend because my daughter is not good at sharing and she loves this movie.  My boys also loved it a dozen or so years ago so it has staying power.
031603441X|5.0|Great read by an awesome guy.  Better than I thought it would be.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, etc. etc. etc.
B00003CXBK|5.0|His movies are visually stunning in their detail and artistry.  The stories are warm with just enough scary to stimulate the young minds they are geared towards.  I have loved these movies since seeing My Neighbor Totoro almost twenty years ago.  Our young daughter is mesmerized by them so much I had to hide a few so that she would explore other forms of entertainment.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This book doesn't compare to &#34;A time to kill&#34; disappointed, it was such a slow read. I wouldn't recommend this book
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Great book.  They did an admiral job of capturing the book even though the read is always better then the watch.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story in this book was good, but the character development was excellent. I would have given it a 5 star but the only thing I didn't particularly like was the way the Author jumped from character to character in each chapter. Once you get used to it, it's OK, but not my personal 1st choice in style. Good read. Hard to put down.
0879309210|4.0|I doubt there's a better manual on guitar repair, but this one could be even better.  Sometimes the organization is a bit poor and definitely feels like it's been pulled from Dan's columns over the years.  The included DVD is pretty useless and feels like a bit of an upsell to Dan's repair DVD series, which is quite expensive.  Despite these issues, there's a lifetime's worth of great information in here and it makes for good reading.  Coupled with some digging on youtube for videos of people making some of these repairs and a few quality tools, I've been able to get good results on a few projects.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! Neither of the main characters was exactly as I thought they would be.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|I love, love, love this movie!!! I have been looking for it, I was happy to find it on Amazon.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always he wrote a really good book.  One to keep you interested and always adding something to make you realize it isn't going the way you thought.  Hard to put the book down.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|i really like the app and people say that there are too many porn ads but really just ignore them and watch the damn  videos!!
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Meh. It took a great book and completely ruined it in an attempt to conform to some Hollywood CGI concept of a blockbuster. It gets 3 stars instead of 2 because of a few fun or action packed scenes that this film style/mentality brought about. Otherwise, it is a shambles of poor plot, characters we hardly care about, and shot after shot of wave upon wave of hopped up, leaping, &#34;speed zombies.&#34;<br /><br />I don't recommend it to anyone but monster movie cinefiles and zombie aficianados who will hate themselves if they don't see every zombie flick ever made. Just beware, if you loved the book or are more a fan of the traditional &#34;slow zombies,&#34; this movie will piss you off.
0553582011|5.0|Great book, and it looks amazing on the shelf with the others, since they are printed in the same style. Awesome story, looking forward to book 6.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a very cool game,but I wish you can build up lives after a certain points in the game..
B000OPOAJS|5.0|I would give this movie 6 or 7 stars if I could. In my top 5, easily. Underrated - many people I know haven't seen it. Awesome cast and the bluray looks great.
006202406X|1.0|It was hard to tell who was who in each chapter. Also, had a very poor ending. It's not the death that ruined it to. In the end it was the weak forgiveness and lack of details. Also, it was repetitive and monotone. If i could, I would take the memory serum and forget the book even existed.
0345529057|5.0|Great books, the set looks amazing when all together in the slipcase. The fifth book (paperback version) is printed in the same style with the same design on the spine, so it all looks great on the shelf.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|A fun movie and a timeless story. Entertaining without swear words. Made when actors actually had to have talent not just look pretty.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Clear description of the mindset change required in order to get the most productivity for your company or organization. Specific examples and recommendations are excellent.
B005VMVUAQ|2.0|Ok movie if you're so inclined and bored and desperate, so so plot, great casting of Kidman and Cage .. Nothing to get excited about but won't make you sleep either
0316055433|5.0|This is one of those books you have trouble putting down, and can't stop thinking about until you pick it up again. The language and intricate observations tend to make one feel they are experiencing each moment as it evolves. A contender for one of the best novels of the year.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Great cast of stars, didn't try to copy the originals, rather came up with new fresher perspective without disrespecting the wonderful original.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|This is a great movie I saw it in 1969 And it was way ahead of its time Many of the camera tricks are still used today but were done here first. This was an early Jack Nicholson movie and made him a household name This was a first for great music in a movie too!
B00A2H9P98|3.0|This movie was OK to watch for entertainment purposes but for plot line and action some of it was just silly. The president is racing around the white house lawn being chased by a SUV firing thousands of bullets at the presidential car and not one of the thousands of armed people outside of the fence fires a shot to help the president? There was a lot of action but unfortunately it made our armed forces and all the technology look silly when some geek hacker over-rides all of the security, monitored the traffic cameras for flying helicopters and unlocked the nuclear weapons arsenal. Come-on man!<br /><br />Watch the movie for the action but you will not watch the film again and so it is not worth purchasing the DVD IMHO. Just rent it cheap and save your money.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Fast, pretty, fun, and no creepy crying popsicle stick puppets like in that candy game! I like the colors and the speed of this game much better.
B008JFURKG|4.0|&#34;Red 2&#34; hits Blu-ray and DVD and begs the question, &#34;Does it live up to its predecessor?&#34; All of the gang from the original is back for more action hijinks minus Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban. While this sequel doesn't hold the same charm, it still makes for an entertaining diversion from the anxieties of real life as we're taken globe-trotting around the world for a couple of hours.<br /><br />Ex-CIA Black Ops agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) find themselves teaming up with their old friends to find a portable nuclear device that went missing. They soon discover they're in a race against time with other organizations wanting to get their hands on the deadly weapon. The adventures take them around the world in their dangerous search as they try to stay alive amongst the crossfire of friends and foes.<br /><br />The audio and video transfers for &#34;Red 2&#34; are wonderful. The movie is presented in 1080p High-Definition (2.40:1). The picture is clean, vibrant, and easy on the eyes. The 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround drops viewers right into the thick of the action with plenty of explosions and gunfire to keep them alert.<br /><br />Some might feel &#34;Red 2&#34; is a little light in the special features department. &#34;The 'Red 2' Experience&#34; takes audiences behind-the-scenes with an array of featurettes centered on the weapons, cast, and stunts in the movie. A gag reel and deleted scenes are the only other items included.<br /><br />&#34;Red 2&#34; is rated PG-13 and with good reason. There's a lot of blood and violence as one would expect from an action/spy thrill-ride. Adult language is used as well. In a world of over-the-top R-rated action flicks, &#34;Red 2&#34; is really a rather tame good time for the mature members of your family.<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking something was missing from &#34;Red 2.&#34; It feels like a reunion with characters you came to love in the original. At the same time you still mourn the absence of Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban. Anthony Hopkins does a relatively good job filling their shoes with his charisma as the scientist who created the lost nuclear device. While it's technically more of the same that we got from the first film, &#34;Red 2&#34; has enough humor and energy to keep viewers interested.you still mourn the absence of Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban.

0307744434|4.0|The Night Circus is a fantastical book. It's somewhat in the style of modern-adaptation-dark-fairytale novels (ala Holly Black, Sarah Cross, etc), but is a unique story of its own.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern definitely has a gift of imagination, and beautiful prose. The book is not high-octane action, but more like a dream- time bends and shifts (it's told across several years, out of order, but you do get a date reference at the chapter's beginning to orient you), and anything is possible. She toys with the concept of magic, human potential, illusion, and expectation. And, like the Reveurs, I was charmed and enchanted.<br /><br />It's hard to say much about the story without giving things away, but suffice to say there are a handful of characters and you'll love and be frustrated at all of them.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for fans of Victorian magician things (The Prestige, The Illusionist, etc), imagination/creativity with pretty prose, high-concept elements, clean romance, historic magical realism, and storytelling.<br /><br />(and also...please can there be a real Le Cirque des Rêves? I'll assist Tante Padve, or sell tickets, or make chocolate mice, for free, if I can explore Le Cirque every night!)

This book is now my &#34;bible&#34; and have told all my friends who are interested in living longer and feeling healthy to buy it.
9626343230|4.0|Just received this and I have been enjoying the high quality of this recording compared to the audiobooks that are available for free online, which are my usual fare.<br /><br />The voice actress here is simply superb! I love her accents (especially Mrs. Van Hopper!) and the way she reads. And the music accompanying the recording is swoon-worthy and matches the feeling of the story perfectly.<br /><br />But. It's abridged! I probably wouldn't have ordered this if I had noticed that earlier. Why abridge such a fabulous production? I also wanted to buy the recording of Jane Eyre by the same reader, but it's abridged too. Alas!
B000002BFZ|5.0|This album had me listening with my head cocked to the side like a confused dog for the first few rotations, but I quickly began to appreciate the many moods it provided.  The most confusing aspect was having such a slow song as the opener, which is among the most unique things about this album being the only one to do so.  That's not to say that \\"Sometimes\\" is \\"boring\\" or a bad song, but considering how Vs. and Vitalogy opened, it was as if they were easing you into this one before cranking up the volume on \\"Hail Hail\\".  Another thing about this album that stands out to me is that it's the last time you really hear Eddie's growl.  The kind of raw energy and urgency in Ed's voice became far more sporadic after No Code.<br /><br />\\"Who You\\" Are and \\"In My Tree\\" let drummer Jack Irons have the spotlight for a moment before the Neil Young-style, mid-tempo treat \\"Smile\\".  Next up is \\"Off He Goes\\", which is one of my all-time favorite Pearl Jam tracks, a poignant storytelling gem about an unstable friendship, before picking up the pace again with \\"Habit\\", a fast-paced in your face rocker about addiction.  The next two, Red Mosquito and Lukin, are my least favorite on the album but I still rarely skip past them.  Then we have \\"Present Tense\\", another of my all time favorites, a thought-provoking, insightful powerhouse.  \\"Mankind\\" is a fun track, sung by guitarist Stone Gossard, which in parts sounds strangely similar to Vedder so I didn't immediately realize it was Gossard.  I really enjoy it and wish he'd take lead on a song every album or two.  The last two songs are great, starting with the poetic almost spoken-word approach of \\"I'm Open\\" and the hypnotically melodic \\"Around The Bend\\".<br /><br />I think as the band's popularity had started to wane, they took the opportunity to be a bit more experimental and branch out, and the music on this album definitely reflects that.  It was considered a commercial flop, but after Vs. sold a million copies in its first week, it probably set some unrealistic expectations for future releases.<br />Even though this isn't at the top end of my ranking order for Pearl Jam albums, I still love it.  The 5-star rating is almost exclusively tied to Off He Goes and Present Tense, but I also really love the intensity of Hail Hail and Habit and can't get enough of Mankind.  This album doesn't get much attention in the setlists, maybe one or two every few shows, so I don't think the band is very fond of it but I think it was a big step forward and foreshadowed the obvious \\"rebirth\\" that took place during the Yield sessions.robably set some unrealistic expectations for future releases.<br />Even though this isn't at the top end of my ranking order for Pearl Jam albums, I still love it.

B0000028UK|4.0|As if &#34;Ten&#34; wasn't enough to completely suck me in as a lifetime follower of Pearl Jam, seeing their performance of &#34;Animal&#34; at the 1993 MTV VMA's had me rushing to the store when Vs. was released.  The one-two punch of &#34;Go&#34; and &#34;Animal&#34; to open the album was enough to show that these guys were laughing at the idea of a sophomore slump.  Then comes &#34;Daughter&#34;, a haunting acoustic-based number of rather dark subject matter (think Jeremy).  A few of the &#34;middle&#34; songs like Glorified G, Dissident, W.M.A. and Blood feel like more like filler to me, but the drum intro for W.M.A. is incredible and Dissident does have its moments.  The rest of the album overall is very good, starting with &#34;Rearviewmirror&#34;, a great steady rocker about leaving a troubled past behind, followed by the eerie, funky tones of &#34;Rats&#34;.  The next track, which has become known as &#34;Small Town&#34;, is a sweeping acoustic ballad with frequent swings in the vocals.  Leash is a bit of an oddity, but not a bad song, and the closer &#34;Indifference&#34; fits the mold of their impressively thought-provoking and insightful slower numbers that nicely finish out many of their albums.<br /><br />Aside from what I consider a weak middle offering, Vs. is a great album and it effectively proved Pearl Jam weren't a one-trick pony.  For those looking for the more rowdy and rocking side of Pearl Jam, this is definitely one to own!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|While this game has been enjoyable so far, I'm disappointed at the Facebook connection issue. To finish 1 of the quests, I must connect to Facebook. I don't have a Facebook account, nor do I want one.<br />  Other than that, the game play is easy to understand. It does start taking a lot of time to do things eventually, but you can always buy \\"crowns\\" to speed things along.<br /><br /> It does take what seems to be a long time to load, but once it's up, it's up :)<br /><br />  I do recommend this game, its quite enjoyable and easy to understand. I just wish I wasn't forced to do anything with Facebook to complete certain things. Makes me wonder how far I can go in the game without joining Facebook.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I've been wanting to start reading some classics. However, this is not what I was hoping it would be. While I've enjoyed reading other books on my Kindle, this has been a drudgery. Maybe it's the antiquated writing style, but this is not a smooth read. I tried using the audio component, thinking that would make it more enjoyable. That was even more annoying! The voice is completely mechanical and monotonous. Without vocal inflection and pausing as a human would normally sound, I couldn't keep up with the story. Not for lack of trying; it's just completely incoherent. Sadly, while I'm an avid e-book reader, this is not the story for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book is an easy read which becomes more and more compelling after the secret is revealed. I'm ready to read another Moriarty novel!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a classic old time game and it is nice to play with other people. The only problem is it keeps asking for money, which I do not do I would rather play for free or not at all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Unexpected plot turns and clear writing.. Gone Girl book held my rapt attention from start to finish.  I just bought the rest of Gillian Flynn's offerings.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is great it gives you alot of new ideas of things and crafts for your printer fun.1 2 3
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I liked this story. More like his older stories.<br />I would recommend this book To others. Good read. I am à big fan.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I finally downloaded this game because lots of my friends were talking about it.  It is fun but I am old and need more directions.  I still don't understand exactly what I need to do.  Oh well I will keep plugging away at it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great graphics. Easy and fun to play. I highly recommend this game to kids or adults. Always something new to do.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Similar to Son House and so many other blues masters, many of these classic songs have been covered over the years.  Most people have never heard the originals in their raw/pure form. Great American music.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|NIN never fails to disappoint. Another rich and varied soundscape, this is the very best kind of storytelling. I recommend the deluxe audiophile version.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Headline says it all. Guys, hang your analytical minds at the door for this and just enjoy the guy stuff.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I'm a late-comer to Lady Gaga's party, but glad I gave her a listen anyway. I have admired her singing talent in the past, and have adored her outlandish, adventurous fashion statements always. ARTPOP conveys both personal and commercial sides of Gaga; seamlessly blended together. Parsing one from the other is part of the fun of this album, as well as picking out all the film, sculpture, art, and pop culture references she's inserted.<br />I weep for the generation of listeners who won't pick up on any of that.
B0036G1T78|3.0|It's &#34;just okay&#34;, but not great, This was the movie I went on my first date with my to-be eventually wife of 33 years at this point, so it is special to me.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have the first 2 books and needed the 3rd.  Good book. I can't wait for this movie to be made!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|It got a little long about a third of the way into the book, but continued on with the story of this young man...and the story of a beautiful painting that has such power, as many pieces of art do, to have impact on so many lives.  The musings at the end of the book are meant to be read again and again, about the possibilities and power of art on so many lives, inlcluding this young man.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books.  I read &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and saw the movie and had to get the next book.
B00B5C0YOO|2.0|Nothing like titanium pro.  It keeps the older backup of the app but without user info so what's the point.  Might as well sideload an older app if one really really wants an older version.<br />Got it for free in the giveaway of the day...used it for a week and uninstalled it.<br />I didn't pay extra for 32GB kindle to use 60 percent of that to backup every single app without discretion.

1449410243|5.0|It's simply hilarious. Having adopted a rescue cat recently--my first cat since childhood--I can really relate to The Oatmeal's &#34;take&#34; on all things Cat. The book is in great shape, and the shipper did a great job packing it and sending it promptly.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fun game once you get rolling. Entices you to check the game often to gather resources and improve your base. Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Great mix of dance music with a sprinkling of ballads. Many of these songs sound radio-worthy, though sometimes the lyrics seem slightly juvenile. Most of the songs sound like 80s-tinged pop music.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|you need keen skill to be capable of even considering the Flight that took place in this movie. as always Denzel Washington pulls off one of the greatest performance and makes it all believable through his broken story.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|good movie. lots of action and great filming. I injoyed it from begining to end I have nothing else to say.
006202406X|1.0|I read both Divergent and Insurgent multiple times.  They were fast-paced and enjoyable.  I did not care for Allegiant - it was not fast-paced.  It was confusing.  The character development that made the first two books so enjoyable was missing.  I got very bogged down with paragraph after paragraph of genetic explanations.  I kept wondering when anything interesting would actually happen.  Half the time I thought I was reading as Tris but it was supposedly Four instead.  His character didn't offer much insight, as his chapters were very heavy with dialogue.  By the time the ending rolled around, I didn't really care what happened anymore.  The entire book was so bleak that I certainly wouldn't read it again.  If you've started the series, you may as well read this one, but expect to be quite puzzled about more than a few things.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Wow, what a well-done rendition of Hamlet.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  The main actor is very entertaining though it is spoken in Shakesperean English.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|I originally bought this book because it taught the correct method of running: the front-foot landing. At the time I had no interest in CrossFit, or any other type of fitness programming than that which I was doing.<br /><br />Over the past 3-4 months that has radically changed.<br /><br />My fitness philosophy beforehand was: Calisthenics (Pushups,Pullups,Situps,Flutter Kicks,etc.), Large amounts of Running and Swimming (This really became more cemented after I learned the correct way to run.), and some Bicep Curls, and Bench Press once every 3-4 weeks just to add some variation.<br /><br />The primary reason I did not get into weights big time was because I wanted to be a fast runner & swimmer, not slow and bulky.<br /><br />Well, I do not have time to tell every detail, BUT, I started doing CrossFit WODs 2 1/2 months ago, and after 2 weeks of doing that, I could do more deadhang pullups than before (35), and not only was I fitter, but some of those gains rolled over into my running & swimming times.<br /><br />It did not really occur to me to use CrossFit for ALL of my fitness programming, I had gotten to the point where I was trying to figure out how to keep increasing my running mileage, without feeling exhausted every night; I finally realized that I was hitting my head against a wall, and that what I thought was correct, was wrong instead.<br /><br />I then started looking over CrossFit Endurance's website, and then remembered that I had this book!<br /><br />At the end of the day, I have seen much better results using CrossFit programming.<br /><br />As I have read dozens of testimonials from CrossFit people all over the web, I have realized how blessed I am to learn of CrossFit while I am 17, instead of 40 or 50.<br /><br />I think that I have a lot of potential, I can hardly imagine what I will be able to do in 2-3 years from now.<br /><br />So not only am I stronger, fitter, than before, but before to long, I think I will be faster too.<br /><br />This book is much more important to me now, than when I bought it 6-7 months ago!ok is much more important to me now, than when I bought it 6-7 months ago!
B007DA2FHG|4.0|It's a good movie, but somehow I was alittle disappointed in the overall movie. I would not watch it again
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really got onto this journey.  I'm an avid hiker and found her familiar.  I loved her writing and the way she weaves her life's story line through her hike.
1452101248|5.0|I have had trouble finding main dish vegetable recipes that my family will eat. PLENTY offers easy to follow recipes, great pictures and I would say 80% success rate.  Leaving meat behind means learning to fix dinner all over again. This cookbook is a great help and lovely to just page through.  The only down side for me is finding some of the fresh and ethnic ingredients.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Simply amazing. Riveting.<br />Allegiant kept me on my toes.<br />I'm really disappointed that the series is now over!! Great books.
B00631HASU|1.0|i played it once. frozen the kindle fire hd up. then i went to restall it and was not able to. very disappointed especially after spending money on it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was very good though I felt it was slow to start.  It did not echo for me as did the Kite Runner and a 1000 Splendid Suns.
B00GMONG90|5.0|Pentatonix continues to innovate, creating more great music.  I missed the release day, but bought this as soon as I knew it was available.  Yeah!<br /><br />Be sure to watch the videos of these songs, also.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I can't listen to music without it. I wish it didn't hiss if you listen with it while its charging.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|OMG! I love this app twitter is literally amazing. it rarely loads.... GET THIS APP TRY IT OUT.! best part is its<br />..FREE
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is a great series!! The first and second seasons are extremely funny. Love the cast. It is my new favorite show on tv. My husband even thinks its funny so I don't think its just a chic show. It can go both ways
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very addicting as I can say so. I'm Zoey and even as a teen I still like this. The only problem is that why are the costumes so much? I LOVE THIS GAME. SUBWAY SURFERS RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0062127241|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my son.  Kind of hard to say more than he obviously must really like it to have put it on his Christmas list.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell is a favorite of mine. This book enhanced that opinion. For those who like non-fiction a must! Thanks Malcolm.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It works great, I charge my iPhone and iPad simultaneously through the port without any issues. It is very convenient.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a wonderfully crafted novel in the SF genre that has strong philosophic and emotional underpinings. Its recent film version is true to the novel and well worth watching after reading this award-winning book.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|Personally, I'd watch Henry Cavill read a newspaper!...But as far as the movie goes...it was great. Lots of action, special effects, etc. I think people forget sometimes that movies are just that...movies! We use movies to get away from reality so if stuff doesn't look real that's alright with me... I think the plot was good...there was a lot about who the man behind the cape really is; it made him seem more...human. Of course, I'm a super hero fan anyway... So, if you're looking for something with deep substance you might pass on this...but if you're looking for a fun good vs. evil, hot hero, with a side of romance flick...this is it!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|it isn't too often that I have read a book so quickly, without stopping.  It was Spellbinding.  I didn't know what was going to happen next.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The best Grisham book I read.<br />I could no put it down..  I would definitely recommend reading!  Me citing from beginning to end
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Today is a fitting day for me to be leaving this review, being the 50th anniversary of the death of JFK. Stephen King novels are not usually my jam, but this book was recommended by so many people that I knew from various age groups and tastes, all with the same glowing praise. They were all completely right. I blew off plans, twice, because I had to keep reading. I haven't been this taken with a book in years. It sucks you in completely and I know it's just a matter of time before I reread it again.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The book itself is EXTREMELY good. But if you're looking for a short read, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. Very long, but totally worth spending my time reading it!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I enjoyed the author's website and the book didn't disappoint. Not to be missed is her amusingly accurate portrayal of the depression sufferer.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun and funny at the same time. When u see minions you expect humor and this game gives you that loaded with fun and challenges as well. Like how you can challenge your fb friends and taunt them if they lose.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|A great collection celebrating the Doctors of the NEW series.<br />I can only fault it because it does not include the profiles of the Doctors of the ORIGINAL series.<br />Let us not forget the past while celebrating the present!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Got me hooked. I love how artistic it is. The characters are amazing.  And the story is super interesting. :)
0345536886|5.0|I whizzed through this novel at breakneck speed. Its engaging hero, David, has a mini-breakdown and jettisons his grinding (but highly paid) position with a huge legal firm in Chicago - and ends up (through alcoholic misadventure) talking himself into a job with a seedy firm of ambulance chasers. The hilarious opening sequence taking you from his abrupt departure from corporate life through his boozy day at Abner's Bar - to his eventual crash landing at Figg and Finleys is a delight. The novel's main storyline centres around the small firm's court battle with a huge pharmaceutical company, possibly marketing an anti-cholesterol drug with damaging side-effects. Shot through with dark humour and sharp observations, 'The Litigators' is a fast, highly enjoyable read; I am reminded of what a good writer Grisham is and will now return to his novels, so many of which I have yet to read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|pretty good！ but it is limited in china.No Youtube or sth like it can be used，just put computer screen on the tv which has HDMI INPUT.
B00G0PCGIS|4.0|Really good album. Listened to this band back in high school. I saw that they had a new cd, and decided to give it a try. There are some cheesy lyrics on here, that make you scratch your head, but overall, very impressive album. There is some great, catchy guitar grooves in this album. I give it a thumbs up!
1439196834|3.0|I will say right off the bat that when I ordered this item I thought it was going to be like a hardback from the show, but that was my fault since I did not actually read this carefully enough. Though the packaging for this and two other items were atrocious! they stuck this and one other book in a box, not in a bubble envelope or anything to protect it, with a mini fridge I ordered for another person's Christmas gift! I would like to believe that this was just because this is close to the time that people are ordering Christmas gifts or other holiday gifts but seriously! If you mark at least one of the items  in the box shouldn't you have common sense not to put them in with a mini fridge!!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Love this CD.  Had a similar one but this one had songs that the one did not have.  Very please it came on time.
143911000X|2.0|I will say right off the bat that when I ordered this item I thought it was going to be like a hardback from the show, but that was my fault since I did not actually read this carefully enough. Though the packaging for this and two other items were atrocious! they stuck this and one other book in a box, not in a bubble envelope or anything to protect it, with a mini fridge I ordered for another person's Christmas gift! Cause of this it is now bent on the corners of the book. If this was a gift for myself I might not care, but seeing as how this is not a gift for me but for my best friend I'm a little annoyed at the packing methods used. I would like to believe that this was just because this is close to the time that people are ordering Christmas gifts or other holiday gifts but seriously! If you mark at least one of the items  in the box shouldn't you have common sense not to put them in with a mini fridge!! Unfortunately I will not have the chance to try returning this so My friend is going to hopefully understand.
B00338QENI|5.0|I was not expecting to relish this book as much as I did.  What a fascinating story of a virtually unknown woman that impacted modern medicine profoundly.  We owe HeLa so much!  In has been several months since I read this book but it has stayed with me and I still think about her and her story
B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|The message is information in the book is educational, however the style of writing is poor.  It flips between years and locations.  I understand it is her telling the story, but it is choppy and full of names/places that are not descriptive.  The beginning was good, the middle was tough to read, and the end was better..  overall I would recommend this book, but with reservations
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is fun and a little different.  Multi sided,  Kind of noisy.  I don't recommend it for playing on airplanes,
B006AZZPCM|5.0|works well. Have this on both kindle fire Hd s, and it works fine. Lots of nice features. I<br />Have not noticed any porn ads. Try it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie, Great DVD. What more can one say?<br />It's The Hobbit, a great entertaining epic fantasy fiction movie.<br />If you liked Lord of the Rings, you'll enjoy The Hobbit.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|Great book. Compact, to the point and it just works. Get your routines going, read thourroughly and get results! Not fast but slowly and very surely. If you dedicate time to this program then you just can't go wrong.<br /><br />Valuable asset to my fitness library of books!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Great story line, realism, action packed. The movie reinvents superman new interesting perspective we are introduced to the world of Krypton another story line. watch it!
B003WUYP56|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Lee Smolin and I found it to be quite enlightening. He begins by introducing us to what he refers to as the five great problems in physics. He notes that “any theory that claims to be a fundamental theory of nature must answer each one of them.” They relate to quantum gravity, problems in quantum mechanics, unification of forces and particles, the free constants in the standard model, and dark matter and dark energy.<br /><br />He then discusses the quest for unification going back to the work of Herman Weyl, who invented the modern concept of unification which eventually led to string theory. We learn of the work of Nordstrom, Theodor Kaluza, Oskar Klein, and Hendrik Lorentz, and the early work on the concept of extra dimensions. This work set the stage for the science of unification of the four fundamental forces of nature – electromagnetism, weak force, strong force, and gravity. The difference in the forces today arises, as we learn, from spontaneous symmetry breaking. The idea of a grand unification sought to find a symmetry between the quarks (ruled by strong force) and leptons (ruled by electroweak force). This symmetry came to be known as SU(5). But it was soon learned that something call supersymmetry could provide a way to unify the bosons (force particles) and the fermions (matter particles). Then there is the quandary called the hierarchy problem – the wildly differing strengths of the forces and the large differences in the masses of the particles. We then learn that supersymmetry may be important to understand why the Higgs maintains the weight it has, which is 120 times the mass of a proton. This research lead to something called the MSSM or minimally supersymmetric standard model. Smolin breaks all this stuff down nicely in an understandable fashion.<br /><br />Smolin carefully explains all the problems associated with the current understanding we have. For instance, the MSSM adds 105 free, adjustable constants to the already existing 20 of the standard model. In addition, we really don’t know why the particles have the values they have as they are determined experimentally. He notes that by 1974, “a background dependent approach to combining general relativity with quantum theory did not make sense.” We are then introduced to the next great thing: supergravity – could this provide the long sought answer? At the time of the writing of this book, Smolin felt that no one really understood what supersymmetry really meant.<br /><br />But a revolution was brewing in the name of a concept called string theory. Was this finally the answer to unification? Smolin explains the early history of the theory – how it required twenty-five dimensions, tachyons (particles that traveled faster than light), massless particles, and the omission of fermions. These problems were solved eventually and much progress was made on the theory. String theory came to provide an impressive list of accomplishments: unification of elementary particles, gauge fields, gravitons, and unification of bosons and fermions.<br /><br />A second revolution occurred around 1995. Here we are introduced to the concept of dualities – two different ways of looking at the same phenomenon. These dualities provided “relationships” between the five superstring theories that existed. These five theories became part of something called M-theory. Joseph Polchinski discovered that string theory was not just a theory of strings; he entertained the notion that other objects lived in the ten-dimensional spacetime. These objects came to be called D-branes. New relationships were discovered: between string and gauge theories and between branes and black holes. Smolin notes that “Our understanding expanded greatly following a set of fascinating, unprecedented results.” He realizes unfortunately that though M-theory remained a tantalizing conjecture and it was tempting to believe it, “it is not really a theory – it is a conjecture about a theory we would love to believe in.”<br /><br />In 1998, it was discovered that the expansion of the universe was accelerating. This required something called a positive cosmological constant – something string theory failed to predict. A crucial breakthrough occurred in 2003 by a group of scientists from Stanford. The problem now was that there were ten to the 500th power possible theories – yikes! As Smolin remarks, “If an attempt to construct a unique theory of nature leads instead to ten to the 500th power theories, that approach has been reduced to absurdity.” So it seems the string theorists are now ready to accept that there is a landscape containing a large number of theories. The history of science has seen many promising theories fail; could this be such a case, Smolin wonders. Particularly, if we find that supersymmetry, higher dimensions, or unification of the forces does not exist, then string theory would prove to be false. Perhaps, as Smolin posits, somebody in the future will formulate a string theory which will uniquely lead to the standard model of particle physics, will be background-independent, and will function in our three-dimensional non-supersymmetric world.<br /><br />Smolin now moves beyond string theory to discuss some very interesting phenomena. There is an interesting property of something called the cosmological constant which is referred to as the scale R. Combining this with a constant of nature gives us the speed of light squared divided by R. This is a special acceleration value that seems to be related to dark matter and the acceleration of stars found in galaxies; it is called Milgrom’s law, and it may have important consequences for Newton’s law of gravitation. Then there is the additional acceleration affecting the Pioneers 10 and 11 spacecraft pulling them toward the sun. In addition, something called the GZK prediction may even indicate a breakdown in special relativity at extreme energies – all fascinating stuff. There is some discussion about something called doubly special relativity II or DSR II. In this version of relativity, photons that have more energy travel faster; thus shortly after the big bang, when you had tremendous energy levels, light traveled much faster that it does today. This variable-speed-of-light theory is called Gravity’s Rainbow. Could this lead to the long sought quantum theory of gravity? Only time will tell.<br /><br />Smolin now gets into the sociology of the string theory community. He notes the fierce competition for places in research universities today, lamenting the difficulty for a creative person wanting to pursue their own research program to secure some kind of academic position. He wonders why “string theory, in spite of a dearth of experimental predictions, has monopolized the resources available to advance fundamental physics, thus choking off the investigation of equally promising alternative approaches.” This leads him to list seven unusual aspects of the string theory community, such as tremendous self-confidence, a sense of identification with the group, tendency to believe results because they are widely accepted and so on. This segues into a necessary discussion of what is science. He notes that science has succeeded because of “a community that is defined and maintained by adherence to a shared ethic.” He refers to the scientific community in the terms “ethical community” and “imaginative community” and proceeds to define these terms. Scientific progress can be slowed by orthodoxy and fashion; but as long as we have those who are willing to pursue competing ideas, it cannot not be stopped completely.<br /><br />Part of what tends to stifle innovative research is the fact that “you cannot get tenure in science at a U.S. research university if you haven’t been successful in getting grants, and you can’t get hired unless there is a likelihood that you will get grants.” Smolin sees as a solution the creation of small foundations that search out independent-minded seers who are working on their own approaches to theoretical problems, noting that the Royal Society in the United Kingdom has such a program. It has jump-started the careers of several scientists who now hold important positions in their fields. It seems like we need a better system to produce the breakthrough developments that will move us forward in our quest to understand the universe we live in. Will we solve the five great problems in physics? Only time will tell; I hope so!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love this game. Only 3 stars because it keeps locking me out after I send moves or lives to friends. First I couldn't play for 309 min, then 609 min, now 672 minutes! What's up with that?! Is that a glitch? Please fix.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It worked just as advertised and you can't ask for more than that. I downloaded it to another android device also.
0385537131|2.0|Slow, predictable, boring in spots. I found myself fast-forwarding just to get to another moment in the lengthy time continuum of jury selections and public opinion. I'm a fan of John Grisham, and have read all but one of his books. His writing is suffering and his story<br />plots are wearing thin.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The story is far fetched to the point where I was exhausted rolling my eyes. It definitely started out very well but then it went off into never never land. I kept reading hoping that something was going to happen. Nothing happens, absolutely nothing. Then the book ends. I am quite sure I will never read another book by this author.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|My husband and I are so addicted to this series.  So many twists and turns that it is sure to keep even the most anxious on the edge of their seats!  We had started watching LOST when it was a regular series on TV but we would always end up missing episodes due to work.  So we gave up on it... Watching it when you have the time is \\"fantastic\\" and we are now making it a point to watch more shows this way. Less expensive too, as we have canceled our regular TV cable service and now, only have internet TV!
B000TEPKS4|2.0|The audio quality in this format leaves much to be desired. This is what I get for going &#34;cheap&#34; with an mp3 download. Even with crummy speakers, its lo-fi performance is quite apparent. With better equipment, it feels like a desecration.
B00BU1DH1M|4.0|Doesn't life always get complicated for Rebus.  You have to read every word so you don't miss a clue but you never quite know until<br />rebus tells you.
B00821OX98|5.0|I've only watch season one, but so far the action and suspense lives up to a classic alien Sci-Fi stories.  Without being overly transparent in plot structure and scene effects, Falling Skies does very very well in painting the typical doomsday scenario for earth and humanity, as they struggle to stay alive in a occupied alien invaded society.  I'm loving it, and will continue to view it through the saga to see the final conclusion.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book as well as the series.  Story of teenagers learning to deal with their special abilities, save the world from evil all while trying to deal with normal teenage growing pains and love.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well done...well acted...good story lines for each episode . Looking forward to<br />Season 2 and more interesting guest stars to enhance the regular cast.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I have purchased a few cases before this one and am very pleased with this purchase.  It gives a variety of ways to use the case as well as protecting the Kindle
B008JFUPK8|2.0|With a price tag of 225 M, this movie only made around 290 M domestically. Clearly not that big a hit. WB has decided to save a few pennies by releasing this skimpy set.<br /><br />1. This set contains 3 discs but has only 2 holders/slots. Two discs share the same slot and are placed one on top of the other.<br /><br />2. The 2 blu-ray discs are the most \\"see-through\\" discs I've seen. I compared them to other blu-rays in my collection. There are many that are not totally opaque but this set is practically transparent compared to them. The discs played fine but I'm worried that they maybe of inferior quality.<br /><br />3. As someone who loves special features and \\"making-of\\" videos, I am terribly disappointed by the special features disc. The movie is presented all over again with what is essentially a video commentary. The trouble is it moves from pre-production, to some trivia, to production, to behind-the-scenes in a haphazard manner depending on the scene in the film. If works fine if you look at a scene in isolation and the commentary focus on what was relevant to it, but I was not a fan of watching the whole movie this way. Plus, there is no option to selective play a particular featurette. Again, is WB skimping on on production budget for this set? I'd like to think so. I'm sure its easier to slap some behind the scenes video on top the movie, than create a proper set of menu based featurettes.<br /><br />As much as I love Superman, I wasn't a huge fan of this movie. WB has made it worse by making me feel cheated with a cheaply produced product.
B00GPYOZ7Y|2.0|This season is a garbage filler season.  My love for the chemistry of the cast is the only thing that keeps me watching an 8+ episode long wedding.  They are milking this formerly great show for every dime and it makes me want to punch them in the face.

0553296981|5.0|By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com<br /><br />A literary classic bursting with hope and optimism written under the most desperate circumstances.  This is the best and most important book ever written by a young person. Should be in the makeup of every human being. You will be a better person after reading it and the World would be a better place if every man women and child would read it.<br /><br />I and my family visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. It touched me so deeply that I thought I should remove my shoes for I was walking on holy ground.<br /><br />I thought both film versions of the Anne Frank story were superb. The most memorable scene in the first film, and one that I will never forget, is when Anne's father Otto Frank (the only survivor) returns to the annex after the war to recover Anne's Diary and reflect on what happened there.<br /><br />See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures of enduring significance that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.<br /><br />Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute and saveusa.biz
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Although I really like Barbra Streisand's voice, I was disappointed that some words were changed in some songs to reflect universal acceptance of them, rather than keeping the original words that show that Christmas is about Christ.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a quick-to-learn, fun little mind puzzle that I find perfect to play on my 15 minute breaks at work, in waiting rooms, etc. Hundreds of free levels of varying difficulty which eases you into h<br />arder levels. Once you master the 5x5 grids, the larger ones come more naturally. Never experienced a glitch on my original kindle fire or on my new fire HD. Several coworkers have gotten hooked after watching me play a few boards :)
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellent storyline.  Our early politicians were as complicated and notorious as our present day ones.  it is amazing how little has changed.  He and Jefferson ended up their lives as friends, in spite of their difference.
B008133MDK|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen.  Only problem I have is that there are only three episodes per season.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|Bone crushing metal at its finest.  I am digging this disc big time.  AAAARRRRGGGGG.  &#34;best since the 80's&#34;??, whatever, no need to compare to the past, this is now and this disc friggen rocks you dudes.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book was easy to read and had a story line that was good.  I would suggest it for a light read.
B00BSJ2YVA|3.0|I wish there were more bands like this that are influenced by the great peak of vintage rockers. I realized that even the sound engineers tried to emulate the sound of 70's and did a good job, but personally I would have much preferred to hear more crisp sound of base and drums. This band will go long ways if sound/recording engineers change few things and obviously the band needs exposure on the radio - which currently they have none :(
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Started out a little mundane, but progressed to be a very interesting story of a woman who had no outside influence in her life and then decided to go forward with her life.  I ended up enjoying the novel quite a lot.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Fascinating story that makes it impossible to put the book down. It runs like a movie, scenes are so well written and the characters are superbly formed. One of the best thrillers I've read so far.
B00A9ET4MC|2.0|I thought the book never really went anywhere.  It got a bit preachy in places, and I never got really engaged with any of the characters.  It was readable, and I'd finish it if I were on a desert island, or if it were my book club selection.  The latter was my reason for dragging myself through the whole book.  I thought the story was predictable.  She writes well, and there was an occasional vivid turn of phrase that kept me going.  Her points about racism were important, but not particularly insightful, I thought.  I am an older woman.  This would, I think, be a much better book for a younger person who hadn't lived so much or thought so much about these issues.  I think young people should give it a go, but I'll stick with Barbara Kingsolver and novelists with her level of maturity and subtlety.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Illogical storyline, complete lack of credibility, terrible script, kitsch Hollywood trash - don't waste even the bandwidth to watch it
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater with my 5 year old grandson and he loved it, so when it came out on DVD I had to buy it. I thought the CARS movie was fun but I like Planes even more.
B00AYJCEVK|2.0|Great singer, very impassioned about her cause, but that's what it feels like - a musical production with a cause (I'll just say for the downtrodden). A departure from her usual Hillsong worship offerings. I respect her passion, but perhaps it should have been marketed as such.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I really hate when apps punish you for not being on Facebook. You cannot &quot;sea trade&quot; without Facebook, and you have to sea trade to pass missions! Of course there is an option to buy out of these missions with crowns, but it takes a ridiculous amount of crowns to do this, certainly more than you can ever possibly earn in the game! I have no desire to be on Facebook, and even if I was I wouldn't be bothering my friends to download and play apps just so I can pass missions!!! Way to ruin an otherwise great game!
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Paltrow gives a stellar performance in this period piece. It's intriguing to think that Jane Austin (a bio of whom the movie is based upon) and those of her day would speak in such a witty, almost poetic way in everyday speech. At the very least, author Jon Hunter Spence is witty!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Overall a great book about an amazing man. I loved reading most of it, as I grew up during the 1990's reading MacWorld and MacUser. The chapters about Itunes and dealing with the music labels were a bit boring to me, but otherwise the book was a great read, and a wonderful tribute to a modern day Thomas Edison.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|A rambling story written by a Journalist in which he neither proves or disproves his original premis  that  Jesus was a real man.<br />The money lenders episode is well documented by many in the past, he has not added anything new.there.  The rest is just well known info rehashed.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|awesome case! Really handy while running out of batteries, the charge adapter that comes with my Legend just sucks, it stopped working on my first month...
B00A3SGWYC|3.0|Vulgarity lowers quality of CD, Some great songs but I guess I didn't know what to expect w the explicit cuts!
B004VPAXIY|5.0|The Dreaming I first listened to online on Youtube, while I was doing homework at the school library. Say what you will about the method of me first hearing these songs, but after only one listen to The Dreaming in its entirety I immediately went online to purchase the album. I've never bought a CD after only listening to the songs once, but The Dreaming had me hooked - right from the synthesized drumbeats at the beginning of Sat In Your Lap to the end chanting of Get Out Of My House. I'd never heard anything like this before.<br /><br />While I've I haven't listened to all of Kate Bush's songs (I still have to listen to Aerial and 50 Words for Snow, as well as some of the singles and demos not on her studio albums) I can confidently say that The Dreaming is my favourite Kate Bush album so far. Not that an artist work needs to be listed and ordered, because I think there's something wonderful and unique in everything Kate Bush has done, but The Dreaming just really spoke to me. I loved the obscure sounds, the tones, her voice, the background vocals, the instruments.. This is definitely an album to play loud, or listen to with headphones (which I like because you can hear all the sounds that you might miss if you’re just playing the album as background music).<br /><br />I also love how Kate Bush sings about a variety of subjects that are not necessarily from personal experience. I don’t know why there’s this idea that the songs from an album have to relate to the personal experience of the person singing them or the musician creating the music. The idea of going outside of yourself, and using outside stories, material, etc for inspiration for songs is fantastic and Kate Bush this exceptionally well with songs like Pulling Out The Pin, Night of the Swallow, and Houdini.<br /><br />If you haven't listened to Kate Bush before The Dreaming is probably not the easiest album to start with, but it’s completely worth it. After I had listened to all the songs on The Dreaming I thought to myself, “wow I didn’t know music could sound like that.” Despite the fact it’s 30 years old The Dreaming is my new favourite album.Dreaming I thought to myself, “wow I didn’t know music could sound like that.” Despite the fact it’s 30 years old The Dreaming is my new favourite album.
B004MC0FO8|1.0|Did not work could not recognize any song I sang said I could not sing or hum than how does it work
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I really came to dislike this book the more I read it and gave up on it about a third of the way through.  The style which at first was impressive became boring and repetitive. I kept waiting for Gilbert to get to the point but she never seems to.
B003G4W49C|2.0|The book seems a little dated and a little too dark for my taste. Also, my expectation from the book was that it would be more about the wars themselves, but was more a biopic of the first 10 years of Ender's life. After a while, it started to become stale and I really didn't find Ender a character that I was rooting for. The side bar with Valentine and her elder brother seemed a more interesting story.<br /><br />The description of the action sequences were very bland. Unlike Tolken who would immerse you in to the battle, this seemed to give you glimpses and many cases left you more confused than anything else.<br /><br />Ender's story is sad, and sadly so is this book. But that is my point of view, and you might disagree with me. So go for it and have a read, if nothing else, you will be able to get a sense of what some authors thought of our future during the 1990s.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I'll tell you right now I bought it and it was adorable and funny GET THE APP!!!! It is the most awesomest game on earth!
B00DONF9SS|5.0|Impressed with how detailed this figure is! I was surprised to see there was actually two pocket computers (one open, one closed), and now the fun begins with choosing the pose. Stand feels easier to adjust compared to the one that came with Sailor Moon. Looking forward to the Mars figure next year! ^^
006202406X|1.0|I just cant find myself giving this book 3 stars or anything, call me a hater but I think its okay to hate books just as we love other books! I didn't like the ending, but I still loved the world and the people in it.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This was my first SH Figurarts figure, so I wasn't sure what to expect, although I was assured by friends that I won't be disappointed. They were right. I had some concerns when it came to changing Sailor Moon's hair because the pig tails felt so fragile to me. I also had some trouble with the stand at first, but managed to adjust it well enough to have Sailor Moon standing perfectly in pose.<br /><br />Wish the Luna figure that came with it had something to help her stand though; she tends to fall over a lot on the desk whenever I bump against it just the slightest. &#62;_&#60; Otherwise, love it! :D Would recommend it for any fan of Sailor Moon.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|It was such a fun game.  Wish there were more levels, now.  They kept adding things to make it harder/difficult, but at the right speed.  I would recommend this game to everyone that likes puzzles!!
B0062QFZ10|5.0|Lots of new performances of the Beethoven Violin Concerto are issued each year. The recent crop has included many that are worthwhile. But I suppose few will come to count in the greater scheme of things: how many can give you a sense that they will long be in the lists of the most recommendable? This one by Isabelle Faust probably does count. It is the way her playing is so spontaneous together with her very evident charisma that makes it special. Her violin sings and we have a sense of eavesdropping on the flights of  melody that bring to your mind fanciful images like a maiden singing by a river and birdsong! But, no doubt, the spontaneity is a magical illusion for this is a performance that satisfies us deeply as well as charming us: there is a sense of profound, rapt simplicity in much of Faust's playing. We are never in doubt that this is one of the truly great violin concertos. Interestingly, this is the second account of the Beethoven concerto that Faust has committed to disc. I've not heard the other one but it also is supposed to be very good [[ASIN:B000PD3LBM Beethoven - Violin Concerto; Kreutzer Sonata (Isabelle Faust/Alexander Melnikov)]].<br /><br />The same qualities make this account of Berg's beautiful concerto (it is indeed an ideal partner for the Beethoven) something even more special. We get far fewer accounts of the Berg and one of this quality is a very rare event. Here the angel remembered may truly be an angel but the memory is no mere idealisation and the angel no disembodied spirit. It is a very real and earthy angel: human as well as beautiful. Berg's modernism is fully intact and so is his romanticism. And add to that wild passion! Faust's playing is white hot. Abbado, of course, has always had a special way with Berg and here, too, he gives us the Romantic, the Modernist and the Impressionist sides of Berg's language as a unity. This is a stunning disc.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Clear, concise and truly enjoyable reading.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in Jesus whether one is a Christian or not.  However, one needs to be &#34;open&#34; and willing to listen to some ideas that might be disconcerting.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|The book is well written and suspenseful. It keeps me turning the pages to see what happens to my favourite character, Tyrion!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|vampire weekend can not be more perfect. to me, they are the only band that i could listen to every song ever produced by them and like. they have such a unique sound and perfect singer. the only thing i dont like in this album is the song &#34;diane young&#34;, to which my only complaint is that it is overplayed far too much. in fact i loved that song until the radio ruined it. darn.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Useless on Kindle Fire HDX.  When I try to play something it says I need codecs. When I try install the codecs it says they are incompatible.<br /> 1 star is too many!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I watched a Michael Buble Christmas special 2 years ago and loved the music, so I ordered the CD. The songs are good and he has a great voice. I play it over the holidays and sometimes in July. I have since ordered 2 more of his CD's and also like them. The music is soothing and not the loud, junk on the radio today.
1400082773|2.0|Grandstanding with a self important tone.  So self absorbed and full of self and involved in thinking of himself and himself only...etc...
B0018OFN2W|4.0|It is exactly what you want sometimes: mindless viewing, but with a plot (somewhat), pretty people and quippy lines.  However, I did miss the glower of Vin (he is not in this one).  The cars are painted very silly pastels, which I kind of loved against the macho gangster backdrop.  There are wonderful side characters, which you wish would come back, but since I started this series at Five, I know that they don't make it that far.  I am not a car girl, nor a speed freak, but these movies always provide an amusing escape.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|This is a true thriller like the first season....keeps you interested because you never know what to expect! Looking forward to the third season.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Fast paced action with good characters. Good story, tight script. Very likable characters. Truly believable. Can't wait to see all the other episodes.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Still a classic ! Just viewed one episode from the season. Plan to watch all episodes.<br />I never missed the show growing up. Great TV for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun easy and entertaining game for all ages. Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys a good game five stars in my book.
B00009APK1|3.0|This was a great movie to watch. The movie was in descent condition. It was also priced at a reasonable price. Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If you like this kind of reading I guess it is ok. I did not care for it..I must say I would be anxious to see how they will play all of this out on the big screen.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I can't imagine a world without Twinkies and with all the blatant Bill Murray movie references who could pass it up. Remember your rules.
B0083Z614S|5.0|one of the best stories ever. I have all 6 of the stories and the video too. Loved them all
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A great movie and I love the blu-ray format. Still a classic after all these years that belongs in any sci-fi fan collection.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Its ok.  The battery goes kinda fast.  And the improvement in sound is great, if you've invested in some good headphones.  If you are just using cheap earphones though, don't waste your money, buy some better headphones/earphones first.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|3 formats and I can now watch this movie anywhere anytime. A great way to build your UV collection with a movie that breaths more life into a 50 year legend.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Cause it is just great story telling at its best<br />PS  that is all I have to say about this
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|this is quite a moving story. I will never go back to Sea World or support them in any way. We need to free all captive whales
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The story that continues from the original book, Outlander, is fascinating.  So real that when reading you feel transported to the 1700's and what it was like in that time period.  I would not read the books out of sequence - start with Outlander and move on!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Very fun and addictive, but I'd rather pay a fee to purchase the game and earn powerups than have to pay for any power up I want to use. This game screams money grab.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I haven't stopped playing it. I think it's addictive because your using your brain and it makes me feel like the Doctor running from a Dalek or a Weeping Angel:)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great review of that era.  Great perspective on the split in christian church at time of formation (Paul vs. James)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very additive and fun if you like hidden object games. It also keeps you on your toes and very entertaining.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I read this book because my husband and I were going to Ireland. Most reviews said it was told with humor. I found this to be one of the darkest most depressing books I have ever read. It was very eye opening about a rough time in history. I do appreciate the first hand look into the past. I have a real appreciation for the people who lived through it. However, I must not be in the main stream.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a inspirational book. It is a &#34;must to read.&#34; If you are really wanting to make sense of your world, I suggest you to read this wonderful master piece.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!! I love it!!why is there just me and<br />Nobody else??I made a shop and nobody has been there.<br />how do I go to bed?I know that it says that I can only go to bed at night,<br />But there is no night.anyway, I LOVE this game!!
B000RIHBIE|5.0|Negative lyrics, but so musically talented. Gotta enjoy it. Easy purchase. Would definitely buy from again. Easy easy easy easy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never had a clue what was coming next! Definitely something I would recommend to anyone who has the ability to read!
B00004SZWD|5.0|As always, Stevie is a wonder!  I scratched up my older one because I play it so much, I always just buy a new one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game you should git it<br />I love it just git it and you will love it to
B000063DHL|5.0|What's not to love?!?! This is Iron Maiden - enough said! This may not be their crowned jewel, but it's still a great album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun,frustrating,perplexing,triumphant.....it really is a lot of fun to play even though some of the levels drive you crazy trying to get through them.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Excellent book to help families and friends understand the trauma of Alzheimers.  Highly recommend this book. An excellent help for me.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Way to go big fish, as usual big fish did a awesome mystery.It has a great story line not alot of ho' s  Great graphics,the games were fun and the items u need along the way are great. I know you gave to purchase later, so for all the whiners out there. Get over your selves and realize it's a long game well worth the money I highly recommend the game .
006202406X|5.0|I ordered the first 2 books before the 3rd came out. I finished those within one weekend and was dying to continue. ordered this book the day before it released for a discounted price and it arrived the next day in mint condition.  finished the book that day :)
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I love history so it was a good show for me.  I know some of it is fictional but it is a good show
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best. Books I've ever read. I can't even explain to you how amazing this book is. It has the greatest ending
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I loved it!! I will miss watching it.  I will tell others about the show and what it meant in history.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Cool special edition. Any superman fan will LOVE it. Kids and adults will enjoy watching this movie over a and over again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My mother-in-law got me addicted to this game  now I'm beating her in the game so I get to make fun of her for it it's awsome
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book has all the elements of a great novel. I found myself waking, in the middle of the night, and picking it up to read until sleep overtook me. I would stop, during the day , to read some more. It is a combination of fact and fiction with an insight as to what life was like during the war years in a small village in Germany. It also explained certain practical aspects of dealing with the aftermath of the bombings, which have always wondered about. I was truly impressed with how the narration, and by whom, was done. I am looking forward to seeing the movie and wondering if it can live up to this wonderful book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Slow paced, but never boring.  Told from a unique perspective, it takes the reader through a world few think about.  Sad, funny, but never predictable, the story unfolds and takes you with it.
B000024T5L|5.0|A very good compliment to &#34;The Final Countdown&#34;. Europe fans will enjoy for sure. The videos for this album are as strong if not better.
1594484813|2.0|This is essentially a story about a petty, mostly unsuccessful, con man. Not sure why this author thinks he is deserving of a book. And it is hypocritical for her to criticize his morals when hers are fairly shaken herself.<br /><br />Not to mention the title....this is not a story about a man who loves books but instead a story about a man who loves status.  There are many characters in this book who do love books, but the author almost passes the over.<br /><br />Overall, a very disappointing read.
B000002GQG|5.0|This has been a personal favorite of mine for nearly 50 years. The Moody Blues were among the best British blues based rock bands and 'lost chord' is one of the best concept albums. A wonderful mix of music styles and tempos. Songs like 'Timothy Leary' and 'ride my see-saw' and their 'house of four doors' lead-in are epic. This is a must have for anyone that's into 60's British rock music, and way above the commercial junk the Rolling Stones were starting to crank out like sausages.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I absolutley loved this one!!  So many twists and turns that you couldn't possibly figure out the &#34;why.&#34; This novel is a sequel to Grisham's first novel, &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; and is set 3 years later.  The theme of the novel is race and inheritance with a touch of family and suicide. It will also cause you to ponder the question &#34;Are people entitled to leave their estates to those they choose even if it excludes family?&#34;  There are people on both sides of that coin, and as expected the ones on the side for family are the family who have lost out based on the last will.  The novel is centered around the life of an old Southern businessman, Seth Hubbard, a  not very well known and not all that likeable character, who is dying of cancer and tired of the pain.  He carefully plans his suicide and at the last minute writes a new will disinheriting his entire family other than a small portion to a brother no one is even sure is still alive.  He mails his will to a lawyer he has never met with very clear instructions.  The main beneficiary is a total surprise and shakes up this old southern town and angers his estranged family.  I read it in a weekend and couldn't wait to finish.  This is the genre that John Grishma does best, and I hope he continues on this track.
B000VR824S|5.0|What else can you say? Clapton and the worlds best rock gutarists. This one stays close to the dvd player.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was a quick read that I couldn't put down. All of the characters found a realistic ending. Well Done.
9626341041|4.0|Wonderfully built characters and drama. The ending didn't quite pay off in the way I expected, but I loved the book nonetheless.
B00DJ4PIBK|4.0|Everything was good about this product but it had a razor knife cut in the lego box. Nothing seemed damaged except the box.
1469203820|3.0|Interesting and engaging, yet I'd set my expectations a little too high. I enjoyed the narration choices, and the characters quickly came to life, but I'd anticipated a heroic journey, and received instead the adventures of a struggling young boy (which is of course where all heroic journeys begin).
1455525839|4.0|The two stories in this book are fascinating, the murders, intrigue and action are thrilling, the main character (Corrie) will irritate and exasperate you and you will determine the real killer about one-third of the way into the book but won't realize the truth of your thought until the end.  All of the above makes a good read HOWEVER, this is a watered down version of Pendergast and that Is a disappointing fact.  I enjoy the quirks surrounding him but he is unnecessary to this book.  That is very disappointing.  I hope the next Pendergast story revolves around him not some irritating girl.  Not a bad read but NOT a Pendergast story.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As exciting and thrilling as the first with only a few jerks in the plot that might briefly disorient the reader. The characters are strong and full, and the themes are stirring.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is the best!! I've been waiting for forever to get it, ever since it came out for Apple. Minecraft is absolutely nothing compared to terraria! So much more items, potions, ores, armor, and biomes. There is also many mobs, and bosses too. Get it today, while it's on sale!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is beautifully written! I loved the imagery, the symbolism and all the twists and turns! What an amazing book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It´s wonderfull, I love to find it for my kindle, becouse I have it in others androids equipments  but in kindle is the best
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What a emotionally powerful book! The second half was impossible to put down; each exciting turn of events kept me eagerly reading on. Rich with symbolism and metaphor, this book is worth re-reading. I disagreed with a few major decisions that Collins made--they felt somewhat out of character to me--but the book was marvelous nonetheless.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I have not had any issues with the game .I got the game to kill time and it does do that
B000FBFN1U|3.0|So many surprises; some were beautifully foreshadowed and others so poorly that the character deaths were hard to accept. The explanations of past events read like footnotes periodically, but I had no other complaints. The characters are distinct and intriguing, and the plot, always engaging.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|great read. I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book.  Mr. Grisham did not let me down. Great story with numerous sub plots.
B00BAWEGPW|3.0|Cute and fun. The illustrations are great, the characters are strong, and I am eager to start the next book!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Deer Hunter 2014 is a great app if you are looking for a good free app this is the one
B000QCTNIW|3.0|A fascinating, albeit some what repetitive look at how the human mind works and changes. Needs just five more words!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|A very enjoyable, entertaining and insightful read.  It's every bit as good as Outliers and, in my opinion, better than the rest of his works.
B001VLXNLU|3.0|Though I enjoyed this book, I had a lot of complaints as well and was very close to not picking up the sequel.<br />Prior to hearing anything about the series, I attended an event featuring the authors that left a bad taste in my mouth, though piqued my curiosity about the books. As a result I read the character in the series as being closer to the personality of the authors than to a personality that I might otherwise better relate to. While Zoey is supposed to be kinder and more sensible than the snobbish Dark Daughters, she came off as materialistic and shallow to me on multiple occasions.<br />The main author (P.C. Cast), reflected on her expertise as a writer during the event and how she strove to capture the true voice of a teenager, but I think that the book takes it too far. One of the advantages of writing, in my opinion, is being able to gloss over some of the obnoxious bits of everyday life. But her teenagers were TOO accurate imho, to the extent that will likely cost her some readers.<br />The relationship between Zoey and her grandma seemed a little forced to me, and I had a hard time viewing the grandma as more than an archetype because of it. The phone conversation in particular seemed guided and far from casual.<br />And my final complaint: though I’m not sure if it was a conscious decision or not: I was surprised by the author’s reluctance to take any break from Zoey’s cognizance. There was only one point in the book that I can recall she condensed the day’s activities in order to jump to the action, but otherwise she seemed to write about Zoey’s every waking moment. I think transitioning forward in time would have benefited the book and allowed some of the intense changing that Zoey’s struggling with to settle in more as the author intended.<br />Despite my complaints, I enjoyed the imagery in this book, and being a native to the South myself, I enjoyed the visit to the setting. The romantic interest kept me curious and hopeful, and I’m intrigued by the world she’s (they’ve) created.<br />(Btw, a bit of a geek myself, the Casts’ view of a dork seems very narrow.)m intrigued by the world she’s (they’ve) created.<br />(Btw, a bit of a geek myself, the Casts’ view of a dork seems very narrow.)

0307913090|4.0|Dramatic and thrilling, this book is brimming with lively characters, as flawed and human as any man! Well written and unpredictable, the story had me excitedly guessing, almost from the start!
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Purchased for our granddaughter as a gift. They already has some of this line of dolls and was looking for this specific one. Pricing at Amazon was about the same as you could find these on sale at local stores. However, buying from Amazon made it easy to get just the one she wanted, without the hassle of going from store-to-store trying to find the specific one.<br />Came packaged well with no damage.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|More powerful and moving then I'd imagined, and poetic as well! The book takes you on an emotional journey that captivates, motivates, and then break your heart. The characters are enchanting and endearing, and the writing is poignant and artful.
B00CZ7OC46|5.0|I'm doing a job follow &#34;Remote&#34; guideline and the other 37signals ideas. Company have office but that's not required. I think Internet effects working style for more and more people.
160941392X|3.0|A beautiful, powerful ending made up for a bland main character who's personality seemed to be defined exclusively by the man she was with, and the man she left. She seemed to only be motivated by survival and making others happy; she had no quirks, no dreams, no passions. Despite all this, I did enjoy the story much more towards the end.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We love the Piano Guys first CD and their Christmas CD is great  too.  So nice to hear the music, not singing.
0385394233|3.0|I found Lean In to be Interesting and enlightening, though I'd hoped for a more thorough look into studies and the psychology.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|I don't give out 5 stars often so when I do, there is something REALLY amazing about it.  This story is absolutely attention grabbing and keeping.  There is so much humor, action and adventure you barely have time to blink!  I have watched this movie about 4 times now and still I find things I missed the other times before.  Watching it in 3D is even more fantastic!  You have things flying out at you, the color is phenomenal and the depth of the picture itself is great!<br /><br />The company I purchased this from shipped it quickly and I received it fast as well.  The product was brand new and in perfect condition.<br /><br />I would recommend this company to purchase your items from and HIGHLY recommend watching getting this movie.
0739368257|2.0|An interesting conceptualization of the necromancer, but an otherwise uninteresting &#34;read.&#34; I thought Tim Curry might make it more exciting, but in fact, it took away from the book. Also, boys should not write romance.
B005FUJNNU|4.0|The movie arrived on time and was in excellent condition.  (Just as it was described online.)  I will definitely order from this company again.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it was AWESOME in 3D!!  This is, of course, the Alice in Wonderland movie of old but but with a little bit more cartoon-ish like characters and  scenery.  There are a few different things about this edition of AIW, but overall, it follows the same guidelines as the original.  With it being in 3D you not only have objects flying in your face, but the color and depth of the film is wonderful!  I also own this movie in 2D and there is really no contest on which one is better.<br /><br />I would recommend using this Vendor that sold this DVD to me and also &#34;highly&#34; recommend getting this movie in 3D.
1427201439|3.0|Vivid and engaging. The world Herbert built is balanced and unique, the characters strong and the story moving! 1 2
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I actually own this movie in 2D and it was pretty good.  i got it in 3D because I expected to be even better, assuming things would be IN YOUR FACE.  Well, I was wrong.  There was hardly anything different between 2D and 3D.<br /><br />The company in which I purchased this movie was good to their word.  I received it within the time frame it was suppose to be delivered.  As a matter of fact, I received it much faster then I expected it.  The only issue was that the DVD edition was missing from the set.  This was weird because the casing was brand new, seal and everything.  I contacted the Seller and they immediately replied to my email.  I requested that they just send me the DVD disc instead of making me send the whole thing back and then wait for the new one to come back.  They didn't hesitate to accommodate my request with this.  The only thing that took time was the fact that they were out of the normal DVD version and had to order one and have it drop shipped to me.  Either way, that was outstanding customer service.<br /><br />I would recommend the Seller for your ordering.  As for the movie, it is good and I do recommend you getting it, however, don't bother getting it in 3D unless the price is equal or less than 2D.
0739356135|4.0|Wow! Quirky fun! The narrator is fantastic, the characters are great, and the story exciting through and through! It's brilliant!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Love the movie and very nice how they brought back the Terminator.  Great special effects for the time and then the female terminator actress brought a sultryness to the role.  I could believe that it was an advanced model and could kick his ass.  And when she found John Conner's blood by licking the cotton swab-she looked excited.  Very weird for an android.  Also, it was a good way for her to analyze blood samples to find her prey...but very sick at the same time.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Not making my favorites shelf, but I enjoyed this book, even more than the first. I'm understanding many of the choices the author made in the first book (ones I didn't agree with at the time). The plot never lulls, the characters are strong and I'm eager to start the third book of the series.
B000LW7N9S|5.0|I like the director's cut version-fleshed out Scotty's nephew and why he cared so much for the ensign that was killed.  The movie was great overall and I like when Kirk tells Spock that he has a son David and Spock just says &#34;fascinating&#34; in a oh brother type of way.  The extras are great to get into as well.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|As wonderfully exciting as the rest of the series. Even exposed to some big spoilers there were a lot of surprise twists along the way. An alternate ending or promise of more to come might have been nice, but c'est la vie.
6305428042|5.0|One of the best Halloween movies ever! All the characters are great and its just a fun spirited movie. I watch this movie at least three times around Halloween.
B001DPC52C|5.0|The more I listen to it the more I like it.  I must admit I'm a fan of bands who play with orchestras....even better....a choir! Put them all together and....WOW!<br /><br />For some Sharon's voice might not do it for you....give it time....it grows on you....the songs as well....my first listen some songs kind of sound the same but the more I listen to it the more I appreciate her vocals and the songs on this DVD.<br /><br />My favorite is called, &#34;our Solemn Hour&#34;.....this song is epic!  ....My 2nd favorite is called, &#34;Forgiven&#34;....maybe the most beautiful song I've heard since hearing the Nightwish song, &#34;Sleeping Sun&#34;....other ones that stand out to me....Angels, Ice Queen, Memories and Frozen....the song &#34;Forgiven&#34; makes me cry every time I listen to it.<br /><br />I'm really starting to feel we over here in the United States have been missing out on some great music being made in Northern Europe these last 10 years....the bands I'm listening to now I had never heard of before till this year of 2013.<br />Groups like Children of Bodom and Wintersun....a little more metalcore then Nightwish or Within Temptation but they still have some songs I'm really liking. Check out the song &#34;Time&#34; by Wintersun and also &#34;Angels don't kill&#34; by Children of Bodom....<br /><br />Who would have guessed at 53 years old I would be discovering bands and music that I can really get into and not have to resort to listening to stuff by Van Halen, Malmsteen, Rainbow, Aerosmith, Queensryche, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd etc. etc. thats 20-30 years old.<br /><br />Were missing out so much over here....all the great bands and concerts these days are in Finland, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands.<br /><br />If you like music that can be bombastic and epic at times then I believe you'll like this same stuff I'm not only listening to but also trying to play on guitar.  Thanks go to youtube for bringing us music from around the worldthat our local radio stations are either oblivious to or just don't get.<br /><br />Great job Within Temptation....I'm a fan for life!
006224454X|2.0|gave it 2 stars because I don't HATE it.. I'm just really unimpressed and I wouldn't read it again. A friend recommended the book to me, so I gave it a chance. Honestly, it was not thrilling for me at all. I had to push myself to keep reading. I would read a bit, and then leave it laying around somewhere and then read some more the next day or whenever. I remember actually telling my mom about this book and how it's supposed to be really good but so far I'm soooooooooo bored with it. One of the only times I was excited was at the end of the first chapter (last sentence). I do have to say though, that I usually can guess the ending/culprit/whatever really fast, so I may have higher expectations than normal.<br /><br />It just wasn't for me. I kept reading, thinking that it would just blow my mind if I gave it a chance, but that never happened. bummerrrrrr.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I'm a great fan of this movie. Yeah, the story is superficial. Who cares? The movie is so spectacular it makes up for any other shortcomings. And the extra disc about the making of the film. Totaly increadible. They created new technology just for this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Not sure how to play it, since there are no instructions.  Appears to be the same thing over and over again.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This is a great unit. very user friendly. If you have the H2, you will have no trouble moving to this one.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app. I'm always able to log on with no glitches.  Purchasing is easy and secured. It allows me to stay logged in for an unlimited amount of time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed the story. It had some interesting twists in it. I would recommend it to my friends and family.
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|I love the song and it was easy to download to my phone.  John Legend is one of the few singers of today that I trust can deliver wonderful music that is not raunchy.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I have lost $14.00 in the past two day, because it freezes during purchase, pulls the coins from my account, but never give the credits to the account. Too expensive to continue playing. Will be contacting Amazon for fraud complaint.
0393342212|5.0|This book contains sound advice and alternative strategies that can help.  Sisters two years apart can be best friends or worst enemies.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I bought this as a gift and she loves it! Castle and Beckett are finally together. The episodes are great.
0770437400|4.0|This is a very cool book.  I get that the zombie/vampire/werewolf fad may be a bit tiresome to some (myself included) but this book was recommended by too many to pass up.  I really enjoyed way in which the story was told but it also takes away from any lasting impressions it may leave upon you.  It is written as a collection of interviews from people around the world.  These people range from high ranking politicians in foreign countries to a suburban mom in a rural american town.  This method has pros and cons.  On the good, the method broadens the overall scope of the story and the war immensely.  It perfectly captures just how big and all encompassing this conflict was.  It's cool to see how radically different people's experiences were considering their surrounding environment, social standing and mental fortitude.  On the bad, the interviews are never recurring, meaning that each one is a new and incredibly temporary character.  This means that there is no protagonist, no one for whom to root (I guess you could just root for humanity but where's the fun in that?).  If the writing wasn't so good and the many anecdotal  narratives so captivating, this would be a big problem... thankfully it's not.<br />In short, this was a neat take on an overdone topic.  It made it feel so much more real and believable than the others.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and was very pleasantly surprised at just how deep and exhaustive Max Brooks made this world and the conflict in which it struggled to survive.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Wish I could get more lives more often, because I seem to through mine too quick on the higher levels.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|It is a classic movie of: a love story, redemption, and patriotism, and with a fabulous theme song. Bogart is perfect as the hard on outside and soft on the inside hero. Bergman is lovely as the vulnerable former love. And Dooley Wilson is perfect. The supporting cast may be one of the best.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Couldnt wait for the next season to come out on DVD so Im soooooo happy I can watch my fave show through Amazon at my own convenience at such a great price....The show is epic and keeps me on the edge of my seat each episode
