B000I0QK74|3.0|Every year I buy myself a new Christmas CD.  Last year I bought Chris Isaak and this year James Taylor.  The only song on JT's Christmas CD that I find myself singing to when the CD is not playing is \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside.\\"  Thanks to Natalie Cole, this is the best track on the disk.  I was kind of disappointed in this CD, especially after seeing a live performance of JT this past September.  His personality on stage is so much better than this effort.  My advice to anyone who wants to add another Christmas CD to their collection is buy the Chis Isaak.  Even though he is not as famous, he wrote some of the songs on that CD and it has become one of my favorites.  And believe me, I know Christmas!

Girl can sang! of course she does not sound like miss Holiday but Jennifer is still young give her some more time...She will blow them out of the Water she already does really. I LOVE Beyonce but Jennifer showed her up on this one! Two thumbs way up!! I really hope to hear more from her. It is funny b/c back inthe summer when they were promoting it they didn't even mention her name....now everyone wants to see it b/c of her and of course B and Jamie!
B000002UB3|5.0|Tommy Moon's review has nothing to do with music.  He obviously doesn't know the difference between great music and the sound of a garbage disposal.   <br /> <br />I wish there were more than 5 stars to rate \\"Abbey Road.\\"  It deserves at least 10 stars.  I agree with those reviews who say it is better than \\"Pepper.\\"  \\"Pepper\\" was the cake while \\"Abbey Road\\" is the icing.  My personal favorite on the albumn is the under-appreciated \\"Mean Mr. Mustard.\\"  John's voice at the beginning of the song is cool and gushes out \\"Rock Star.\\"   <br /> <br />The only band that even comes close to the Beatles is U2.  All others are just recycling what they created.

B000I5X81K|2.0|I'm really sorry to give only 2 stars to a Josh Groban album, because when he is on his game, there is NO ONE better.  Groban's beautiful tenor, his soaring melodies.... these are what make him so unique and so rare.  There were a few tracks on Awake that feature that wonderful, transcendant quality I love (tracks 2, 3 and 8 stand out) but where he hops away from the genre just fell flat for me.  Who buys Josh Groban hoping to hear Herbie Hancock?  I admire that Josh wanted to flex his creative muscles and try something different, but I'm disappointed all the same.   <br /> <br />I've been searching far and wide for other musicians who sound \\"Like Josh.\\"  Il Divo sounds like a bunch of tenors battling to see who can sing loudest.  Andre Bocelli is nice, but a little to heavy on the opera, and not the melodic for my taste.  The person who comes closest to Groban is Vittorio.... whose self titled album just came out a few months ago.  I have great hopes that Vittorio will continue to grow in this vein of soaring, melodic fusion of pop and opera..... especially if Josh Groban decides to abandon it.
0743289412|3.0|This book just didn't do it for me.  I usually can read a King book cover to cover within a couple days, but this one took me almost 3 weeks.  And it wasn't because I was busy.  I just didn't like the story.  I didn't like how things connected.  Are we supposed to believe that Scott left hints around the office and in Boo'Ya moon so that Lisey would find his final manuscript?  So she had just repressed all those old memories and they didn't come back until she found the \\"bools\\" from Scott?  I don't I ever really bought into that notion.  I liked the Cell...it was a fast-paced and suspenseful read.  This one was slow and boring and definitely not a page-turner.  I give it 3 stars because it was still well-written as are all of King's novels. <br /> <br />At the end he gives all of the various places he grabbed quotes...one was Michael Connelly.  If you haven't read Connelly, give him a shot.  His book are incredible and I was glad to see that even the master of horror pays homage to the best fictional crime writer of the last 15 years.
1591396190|4.0|This popular book has been translated into most of the world's major languages including Chinese. In China, the Chinese translation edition has been on top of the business bestseller list for many weeks. You obviously feel the managers and entrepreneurs' hunger for winning strategies to stay in business in face of the cutthroat competition.    While the biggest strength of this book in my opinion is to give readers a conceptual framework to focus on new business opportunities when planning their business strategy, what the authors suggest is never to be taken as an immediate remedy. Most industries face tough competition, and managers and entrepreneurs are naturally inclined to look out of the window to see if they can spot a new route to sustained business growth. But let me tell you, developing new business through BD or R&D is so so hard and you know that only after you have exhausted lots of resources and have tried. I used to head a business unit of a leading American chemical firm in China and we tried hard to expand the market through aggressive BD initiatives committing resources as well as the headquarters  support. We chose this new business strategy trying to convert business from not-in-the-kind competition to help us attain the 20% growth target. The challenge was huge with the fact that our market share had been very high, and the industry growth was only about 12%. All the efforts proved less helpful after 18 months because the ambitious conversion took far more time and resources than we had thought. We ended up giving up the strategy.    The lesson is that we can always choose to think big and long term, but a good strategy can never be based on pure reasoning or market research not thoroughly validated. A good strategy has to be based on the resources available (time, manpower, money, experience, alliances/relationships, and so on). Many new business initiatives failed because of lack of resources or a discipline to get the resources committed by the top. Or in other words, the strategy itself is basically flawed because the resource factor has not been placed on top of the strategy formulation.    Overall I recommend Blue Ocean Strategy as a useful framework. It helps you think out of the box while you're also looking at the cost and differentiation side of your competitive strategy.

B0000AFX64|5.0|This is the ten dollar offering of the pilot movie that started the epic series Battlestar Gallactica yes it is true that some of the special effects footage is used too many times but if you watch scenes like where Cylon mother ships get to close the ground lightning then crashes them into Carillon while eluding deception of large pursuing fleet you will realize that part of the reason the Battlestar Gallactica didn't workout is because IT WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME! The glass doors opening on the Cylon Base Stars and the Cylon's red eyes going back and forth were way ahead of their time in 1978. Some of the props from this pilot/movie were later used in Buck Rogers.
0307346609|2.0|In all fairness, I have to give this book a couple stars. It starts out like no other. Bam! I was on the edge of my seat, engrossed, scared at every noise in the house. I couldn't find enough time to read it. I even reread some scenes because they were cool. And then, with the turn of the page, I went from soaring through the passages to drudging through. <br /> <br />I read hoping it would get better. Unfortunately, it delivered more of the same. Evil government and characters with too much hindsight. Once you reach about page 100, no one really has anything different to say. Brooks has a great premises. Different people from different parts of the world telling their story. Sadly, his author voice doesn't change and all the characters sound the same. Except one passage of a young girl. <br /> <br />I enjoy a good zombie tale. But I believe I derive most of my pleasure from the survivors and their interaction with each other along with the Zombies. Regrettably, this story falls short in my eyes. If you enjoy some zombie action, details, science, deep thought, hindsight, and politics, this is the book for you. If like action, thrillers, gore, zombie mayhem, edge of your seat from start to finish, scared until the last page .... Read Stephen King's Cell. <br />
0740748475|5.0|What an amazing collection!!  My softcover copies of these have been waiting to retire, and at long last now they can.  Bill Watterson is to be commended [his creation of this world, and his refusal to sacrifice his art to save space in the newspaper] and scolded [how dare he stop creating this. Making us, suffer in a world without Calvin, Hobbes, Rosylyn, Suzy,Moe, Spaceman Spiff, and \\"the spaghetti incident\\".  The talent that you have Mr. Watterson should not be squandered.  You have the rare gift of humor, talent, and dignity which is being denied to those of us who love you, love your work, and wish you would come back to us.  Much like the losing parent of a custody battle , Calvin and Company <br />we ripped from our lives, taken across country, and never heard from again.  I am hoping that Calvin, one day, will return to us.  This collection is a temporary solution, I would love to get a monthly comic from Bill Watterson in ANY medium he chooses.  The internet has become a ferocious tiger just waiting for Bill to come home to play with it. <br /> <br />Please support Mr. Watterson and let him know that there are some of us out here, who were Calvin growing up, and who are now Uncle Max. <br /> <br />Mr. Watterson, one of the greatest gifts I have ever gotten in my life, was the laughter that I shared reading your stories with my Father, who passed away last year.  The moments we laughed  together over your art are something that I will forever cherish. <br /> <br />Thank You.

B000002ADT|5.0|This is quite simply, the best jazz album ever recorded.  Perhaps the best album of any genre ever recorded.  If you're a die hard fan or even a novice looking to get into jazz and/or Miles, this is a perfect start.  I've been a casual Jazz fan for about a decade, but once I got this album, jazz became the number one music on my ipod.  I've listened to this album almost daily for well over three years now.  I know that sounds a bit much, but it's indefatigable! <br /> <br />There is one downside to this album, however.  You'll get addicted to it and look for something else like it, even a follow up album like Miles's next album \\"Seven Steps to Heaven.\\"  However, nothing compares.  You'll find every other album wanting. <br /> <br />If I had to send three albums into space on the next Voyager space probe to show the pinacle of human music, it would probably be Mozart's 21st Piano Concerto, Bethoven's 9th, and Kind of Blue. <br /> <br />For the price offered here at Amazon, you DESERVE to buy this album.  I don't think I can gush about it any more than I already have, so I'll leave it there!  Just look at the stats, though.  This album got 5 out of 5 stars for over 600 reviews!  Buy it!  Okay, I'm off to enjoy some Jonny Walker Blue and Kind of Blue together again...
1400079179|4.0|OK, so this is the first book I read from Dan Brown and it was good enough to pick up his next one (Angles and Demons).  I thought that one was better, but a little morbid. If you haven't seen the movie read the book first, the movie did a decent job for a movie (remember haters are going to hate).  If you like this one his other books are better (just a little bit morbid)
B000HIVQD0|5.0|I'm 45 and have played guitar since '68.  This is one of those 2 or 3 albums that defines an era.  In this case it is the late '70's punk era --that continued onward for decades.

074322454X|4.0|Stephen Ambrose's \\"Band Of Brothers\\" is a powerful testimony to the singular effects of battle on a company of American paratroopers in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. As Ambrose tells it, the only thing deeper than the change they wrought on the outcome of the war was the change the war wrought on them.<br /><br />After heavy training and embarkation to England, Easy Company of the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division dropped in just beyond Utah Beach on D-Day, helping clear the Carentan Peninsula of German forces. Later, during Operation Market Garden, they helped secure the Dutch village of Son. A period of scheduled rest became their toughest combat experience yet when German forces launched a surprise attack across the Ardennes and the company pitched in to defend Bastogne. Finally, the company made it to Austria and encamped in Hitler's mountain redoubt at Berchtesgaden.<br /><br />\\"Anything was better than the blood and carnage, the grime and filth, the impossible demands made on the body - anything, that is, except letting down their buddies,\\" Ambrose writes.<br /><br />Published in 1992, 50 years after the war, Ambrose's book was a giant step forward in national recognition for the men who fought for the United States during World War II. Ambrose writes with obvious admiration and conviction, yet he also tells some uncomfortable truths. Presenting real heroes to an age with few of its own can be awkward unless it comes with a certain amount of candor.<br /><br />The \\"brothers\\" we read of here are not without their flaws. Ambrose describes such ugliness as looting from civilians and shooting German POWs with an unflinching eye. At the same time, you feel an awe for these men beyond words, their willingness to endure hardship and the likelihood of death.<br /><br />After D-Day, Pvt. David Webster writes his mother about her wish he not be in the van of the attacking army: \\"If the country all had your attitude, nobody would fight, everybody would be in the Quartermaster. And what kind of a country would that be?\\"<br /><br />Tough words for a worried parent, but they resound through the years to our softer if not war-free time.<br /><br />Ambrose's strong identification with the subjects of his book make for a complicated read. He seems at pains to echo their views about their commanders, pro and con, their grousing about the frustrations between the combat, and especially their sense of specialness, to the point where he seems to suggest Easy Company was no mere elite cadre but the greatest unit who ever walked the earth, exerting more energy in a single engagement than football players would if they played three 60-minute games in a row.<br /><br />\\"The 101st Airborne was the most famous and admired of all the 89 divisions the United States Army put into the Second World War,\\" Ambrose writes, an arguable point to present so matter-of factly. [What about the Big Red One?] He goes on: \\"Ever since, men have worn that Screaming Eagle on their left shoulders with the greatest of pride.\\"<br /><br />Ambrose seems less a historian and more a cheerleader at moments like this. Ambrose's understandable pride in the exploits of his countrymen causes him to shed much of his professional decorum. In his Acknowledgments, Ambrose even notes he has been made an honorary member of Easy Company; it's clear he is writing many times with a greater sense of duty to his subjects than to his readers.<br /><br />At least Ambrose gets something back for this; a trust from his subjects he puts to good use as they become our pathfinders for discovering war as the great adventure and bloody travesty it is.nd what kind of a country would that be?\\"    Tough words for a worried parent, but they resound through the years to our softer if not war-free time.

B000IMUYJM|3.0|(4 Stars for the film - 2 Stars for the Widescreen Special Edition DVD)    I've had the Black Christmas 25th Anniversary Edition (with standard aspect ratio), so when I heard about a new Widescreen Special Edition, I pre-ordered it.  I received it yesterday and viewed it on my 26\\" widescreen LCD TV.  Expecting not only more image (on the sides from the widescreen aspect ratio), but also a better picture from the new digital transfer (according to the DVD), I was disappointed to find neither!  The picture was much grainier than the 25th Anniversary Edition, which surprised me.      Since I have a second standard aspect ratio LCD TV (a little smaller, but same manufacturer - Panasonic), which sits next to my widescreen TV, I decided to do a head-to-head comparison.  Simultaneously, I viewed the 25th Anniversary Edition and the new Widescreen Special Edition.  Not only was the Widescreen Special Edition image not as clear as the 25th Anniversary Edition image, but there wasn't any additional image on the sides compared to the standard aspect edition.  As a matter of fact, there was LESS IMAGE at the top and bottom on the widescreen edition.  Ah ha...now I get it.  I concluded that they must have taken a film originally made with a standard aspect ratio and resized it for widescreen viewing.  Sort of like viewing a standard aspect ratio picture in zoom mode on a widescreen set.  You lose image top and bottom and the picture becomes grainier, but it fills the widescreen image area.   I even viewed the standard aspect 25th Anniversary Edition on my widescreen set (in normal mode - with the black side bars) to confirm that the image was crisper on that version on both TV sets, and it was.      I'm no expert at this stuff, but it makes sense to me.  Of course most films made for the theatre have been shot in widescreen since the mid-fifties, but maybe they filmed it in standard to position it for TV viewing.      So in conclusion, if you want the best (and most complete) image and don't mind a standard aspect ratio, I recommend the 25th Anniversary Edition.  That's the one I'll be viewing...Have a Merry Black Christmas Everyone!
B00000J7S8|5.0|The greatest female jazz singer of our times, awesome, brings out so many good emotions from one's heart.  Snuggle up with a loved one and listen to \\"I've got you under my skin\\".  Krall's eyes remind me of Elvis' eyes, looks like Elvis' daughter... but Diana is a far better singer ... a legend alive in our times, go girl go, keep giving us your wonderful music.  My favorite song from Diana is \\"S'Wonderful\\" on her \\"Look of Love\\" album, a true masterpiece in all areas, she is a genius, can bring out the best in a song, and above all she will bring out the best in you, which is the love on your heart. I like the upbeat \\"East of the Moon\\" rendition on this album. Listen and enjoy!
B00005JP9V|5.0|This film is amazing for so many reasons.  Foremost being it has one of the most powerful cinematographic visual strategies that I've seen in a long, long time.  Extremely well-shot but executed in a manner that doesn't call attention to itself like most visually-driven films.  Acting and script are understated yet excellent as well.  If this film doesn't make it to the top of every best film list this year then the critics need to think about a career change.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I wasn't alive in this time period (sad, I know) but still love this film and it creates some unconscious nostalgia.  It captures not the facts of a time period, but the feeling.   <br />The Bootleg version is better and has some additonal scenes which I believe illustrate the theme of the movie perfectly (such as the scene of Penny dancing alone in the auditorium after everyone has left).   <br />The soundtrack is of course great, and at times you want to sing along.  Kate Hudson's performance is touching and complex, and Frances McDormand shines too as the mother.   <br />This is my favorite movie of all time, and I make everyone I know watch it.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I am not the typical \\"Indie Rock\\" listener, but I do have favorites. \\"Plans\\" is one of these favorites. Death Cab For Cutie has done something quite methodical with their sound, carrying a much more intricate musical scheme than some of their indie counterparts.  <br /> <br />Explaining the sound of this album is difficult. The best way to really portray the music is to take each decade of rock starting with The Beatles in the 1960's. Blend these style vocals with the disco and electronic sounds of the 70's and 80's, the grungy guitar work of the 90's, and the sullen emo rock of 21st century, and youve got the sound of Death Cab for Cutie. Should be a pretty impressive band huh? You've got that right. I highly recommend it.  <br />
0743289412|4.0|apart from the dark tower, most SK books start out with some back story that doesnt seem that interesting at first. but when you get to the end and think back on those things, it makes it all well worth while. this book was like that as well. the first half or so i read rather slowly for me. it took me a week or 2 to get through that part. when i reached the middle and had gotten to really know lisey and scott a little better, i devoured the rest. one day. i loved it. as far as his love stories go, i probably liked bag of bones better, but i really enjoyed this one as well. the little things between lisey and scott were what made it for me. their little lingo and the private things they shared are what relationships are all about. they are what makes them great, so it was really cool to get a window into that with charachters you really care about. well done, but i like everything he does:)

B000051Y0G|5.0|Nobody can accuse Cyndi Lauper of being stuffy. On this album Cyndi sings about women who prefer to just have fun with their men without commitment, the satisfaction of ma$turbation and how people who claim to be your friends can forget about you very quickly when someone wealthy comes along to take your place. Oooh, some jaded themes--but what a great album to usher in the era of MTV! Cyndi was perfect for MTV then; and her music remains entertaining now because of its honesty, the passion in Cyndi's voice and its solid musical arrangements.<br /><br />The CD begins with a huge hit for Cyndi, \\"Money Changes Everything.\\" The musical arrangement is great and Cyndi's voice is strong, vibrant and full of electricity! The CD takes a feminist turn with the next song entitled \\"Girls Just Want To Have Fun.\\" \\"She Bop,\\" another huge hit for Cyndi, expresses honest feelings about ma$turbation.<br /><br />However, the CD is far from superficial in its tone. \\"Time After Time\\" is a beautifully arranged song about unconditional love; and there is the passionate love ballad by Prince entitled \\"When You Were Mine\\" which exposes all the hurt someone can feel when a love is lost forever. In addition, \\"All Through The Night\\" is a beautiful song about love between two people. The song entitled \\"Yeah Yeah\\" carries a deceptively simple title: this is actually a love ballad, MTV style, about how a woman will always love her man.<br /><br />One interesting addition is the song \\"He's So Unusual.\\" It is a song written in 1929 about a woman who can't understand why her man prefers to study rather than to spend quality time with her. The sound effects are excellent; you truly believe you are listening to a scratchy old 78 record on this track.<br /><br />The CD ends strong with three live tracks from a 1984 Cyndi Lauper concert. You get live versions of \\"Money Changes Everything;\\" \\"She Bop\\" and \\"All Through The Night.\\" Great!<br /><br />The liner notes include terrific black and white photos of Cyndi as well as color photos of her, too.

A large scale project - ultimately intricate, dense, brave, controversial, ambitious, exhilarating, poetic, epic, and exhausting (based loosely on a section of the book \\"Autobiography Of A Yogi\\").

The band bears a similar looseness, though better intonation, to the one recorded 40 years ago. \\"Working Man's Blues\\" is my favorite; it shows genuine empathy for the U.S. victims of NAFTA and the like -- with far more subtilty than 1983's \\"Union Sundown.\\" It is this growing empathy in combination with the cleverness of his less mature days that keeps this listener hanging on to Bob's every word.
0446677450|5.0|I have both the book and the book-on-CD for Rich Dad Poor Dad. Although some concepts may appear unorthodox or completely opposite of traditional understanding of finances, he inspires and motivates me everyday. <br /> <br />This is a type of book you can read from cover to cover, then set aside, then look back and read again. New things will always hit you from this book depending on what phase you are in your financial planning/asset management. A definite good read.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|My family has always been known for our unusual sense of humor.  My sister and I took my mom to see this.  We were the only ones in the theater laughing, and we were laughing so hard we had tears.  I enjoyed it very much, but I can think of more people who would be annoyed by it than entertained.  If you find humor in the everyday being turned into slightly absurd then you will like this.  If you enjoy \\"you can't do that in a movie\\" humor then you will love this.  I think it was a brilliant mix of drama and humor.
B00005JP4U|5.0|The facts of global warming are very clear, but I have never seen them presented so eloquently.  Al Gore explains the complex issues surrounding climate science with skill, humor, kindness and clarity and in a way that all Americans, regardless of their science background, can understand.  This film will reach people - and hopefully change their behavior.  I am giving a copy to everyone on my Christmas list and I would encourage everyone who reads this to do the same.
B000H30B2C|4.0|I wanted King Kong to be a great movie.  Unfortunately some elements of this film were so bizarre that any chance of this happening were lost. It's O.K. to accept a wild premise like a 25-foot tall gorilla; but common sense demands some attention to logic even in a wild fantasy. Here are my complaints: <br />1. Ann Darrow was secured to the sacrificial altar and unable to extricate herself. When King Kong grabbed her, he would've ripped her arms off.  A wooden cage would have been more logical. Picking that cage apart would've been a neat task for the SFX crew. <br />2. The crossing of the swamp was replaced by that ridiculous stampede sequence. Ever try running in front of a herd of elephants? After that scene I started to get uneasy.  <br />3. The chasm of insects was too deep for anyone to survive the fall... and there were too many INSECTS! More is not better. Lumpy deserved a more courageous demise. <br />4. How did any of the crew know where to go to rescue anyone? There was no logical perspective of the island given and, considering how dense the jungle was, who knew that there was a signpost up ahead with Rod Serling directing traffic. <br />5. I bet you didn't know that some transient Vampire bats moved into Kong's flat the night before. They must have else wouldn't Kong have relocated long ago? But school is not out yet! Lesson One-Introduction to hang gliding is coming up. Where's a pterodactyl when we need one? <br />6. Catch a falling T-Rex in a vine. Win a trip to absurdity.  <br />7. It was absolutely positively IMPOSSIBLE to load King Kong on that ship! But let's say you could. Now all we have to do is keep him sedated with chloroform for (how long a voyage?), and sustain him with bananas intravenously fed. <br />8. Poor Ann Darrow had to run around New York City in dead winter wearing what looked like a gown-less evening strap and she didn't even shiver not once. <br /> <br />After all these crabby comments, I still liked the movie but I'm really sad to say that it wasn't what it could have been. You could still redo this, Peter, on the extended director's cut DVD.  Why not? <br />
B0001WDAX6|5.0|Everyone knows  how great this film is- the only reason I'm writing a review here is because of the dimension the color ads. I know there are purists out there, and I like the black and white version just as well.. But the color ads enough to make the movie a new experience, and seeing this movie as a new experience in any way is a real treat. Plus, kids who don't get Black and White are more willing to watch. This was a VHS, it's not out on DVD, and I doubt it will ever be made available. Colorized movies are a specialty market, and it seems they are disappearing quickly. If you still use VHS, give it a try. You'll surprise yourself how quickly you get over the colorized prejudice. An old classic in (relatively) new format! Happy holidays and thanks for reading my review.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Iron Maiden is not a 70s era band.  70s era heavy metal is black sabbath, judas priest, ac/dc, rainbow, and scorpions.  Iron Maiden's first album came out in the early 80s.  Their first singer was Paul Di'anno NOT Bruce Dickinson.  Paul sang on their first two albums.  Later Bruce Dickinson came into their band and stayed for many classic albums.    I think this CD is a vast improvement from their brave new world, dance of death, and no prayer for the dying days.  Iron Maiden like to keep it old school with progressive rock values.  You will not hear music that sounds heavy and fast like slipknot or hatebreed.  Iron Maiden are old school and they have stayed old school.  If you like intellectual epic songs and galloping guitar riffs and basslines, then this will be for you.  If you like a high pitched, out of tune screamer of a singer then you will like Bruce Dickinson, even though he sounds more shot these days.  Iron Maiden never change their formula or music direction, at times they loose focus and their music sounds horrible (Dance of death and X Factor). At other times like on this CD their music is tight and focused and they do a great job on making interesting songs.  If you liked 7th son, powerslave, and caught somewhere in time then this CD will be right for you.  I suggest you buy this CD if you are into old school metal only.  If you are not then you probably would hear this and think why are these guys trying to pull off hard rock as metal?
0385474547|4.0|On the surface this book deals with changes to a traditional society when exposed to outsiders, however there are deeper themes woven into this fabric.  Okonkwo is the tragic hero or anti-hero of this novel.  He is a man ruled by his fears, especially the fear of looking weak or effeminate.  In response he rules his family with an iron hand, is violent and inpetuous.  Even before the colonizers appeared, Okonkwo had already violated the mores of his community several times, sinning against the earth goddess by beating his wife during Peace week, shedding innocent blood with the slaying of Ikemefuna, who had become somewhat of a foster son, and brother figure to Nwoye, Okonkwo's son whom he views as effeminate and weak.  When Okonkwo tragically commits manslaughter, he and his family are forced into exile.  He loses his prominent place in the clan and has to go to his mother's village for seven years.  While there, he fumes about his lost social position and vows to regain it as a true warrior when he returns to his village.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Okonkwo disdains his eldest son Nwoye who undergoes many beatings and punishments for not meeting up to his father's rigourous standards on manhood.  Nwoye is a gentle soul and was very attached to Ikemefuna, a captive from another tribe who is entrusted to Okonkwo.  When the Christian missionaries arrived, Nwoye is drawn to them, especially because they appeal to the weak, downtrodden, despised and oppressed.  In the Christian community, all are brothers and sisters in Christ, with no regard to rank, clan, caste.  Many titleless outcasts, or worthless men and women were drawn to the missionaries and accepted.  Of course this made Okonkwo despise them even more, as a womanly clan, and he is extremely displeased upon finding out the Nwoye has converted to Christianity, choking him in the neck until Nwoye's uncle intervenes.<br /><br />Okonkwo vows to get revenge on the Christians and waits for an opportunity to prove himself as a strong warrior again.  Tragically for everyone involved, the church is burned down, after one of the zealous converts unmasks an egwugwu (a man portraying an ancestral spirit) during a ceremony.  Now Okonkwo has an opportunity, and puts on his warrior's dress when the messengers come from the court.  Unfortunately for Okonkwo he acts impulsively and slays the first messenger.  Knowing there is no way out, he hangs himself and again commits sin against the traditional Igbo earth goddess.  So even though Okonkwo is fighting against outside influences and trying to preserve his way of life, he constantly transgresses the boundaries of behavior as defined by his own cultural traditional.<br /><br />The only hope that is offered in this sad story is that Nwoye eventually converts all his brothers and sisters and Okonkwo's widows.  This was mentioned parenthetically in the chapter dealing with Nwoye's conversion.  After Okonkwo's death by ultimate sin, the family must have fallen to a very low status, or become outcasts, the very worthless men and women that Okonkwo looked down on.  Ironically, Okonkwo's acts caused his remaining family to gain great hope and promise, no doubt under the gentle loving leadership of Nwoye, the son he never appreciated.elf as a strong warrior again.

0743289412|2.0|I came to Lisey's Story during a period of renewed interest in the works of Stephen King. Having read Cell, Misery, Dolores Claiborne, Rose Madder, Gerald's Game, Bag of Bones, The Tommyknockers, Needful Things, It, Salem's Lot, and The Body in fairly rapid succession while convalescing following an accident I concluded that King is greatly underestimated as an artist by the literary community (which he effectively bludgeons to death in his novel). I've been excited by King's experiments with his medium. I like to watch how he makes the transitions between the sections of narrative by foregoing the use of chapters, or by making a segue between chapters in mid sentence. To me such a willingness to experiment with one's medium in order to discover new effects is a mark of an artist. Anyone with a creative urge quickly tires of doing the same thing over and over again no matter how pretty the result. <br /> <br />However, I find Lisey's Story tiresome and taxing. The central characters don't appeal to me. I can't understand what it is that Lisey finds so loveable about her husband, Scott. I'm doubtful that an act of self-mutilation is the way to charm a woman. Such an act strikes me as gruesomely manipulative at best. More likely it identifies one's admirer as certifiable. The couples' use of neologisms as a sort of intimate lovers' language just grates on my nerves. Smucking-ay, as they say, so to speak ! After a while I'm thinking to myself, \\"Okay! Okay! I get it! That's how they speak to each other. Now drop it. Don't talk to the reader that way.\\" And Lisey's relationships with her sisters is the sort of giggling, conspiratorial bitchiness I'd expect to find between, what?, a bunch of thirty-something émigrés from the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. In order to buy into the premise of Lisey's Story I have to regard her as a somewhat more, well, mature and serious individual with a firm grasp of the dark forces at work around her. Instead, she comes across simply as a willful and headstrong but woefully ignorant individual of untrustworthy instincts, who is quick to make judgments about others on the basis of little or no information. <br /> <br />Lisey's Story struck me as an sort of amalgam of The Goonies and Rose Madder. Stephen King is a masterfully compelling writer fully deserving of his large and loyal readership. As a novelist he is also a true artist, as demonstrated by his willingness to experiment with the possibilities of the written word. However, not all artistic forays find their mark. For me, Lisey's Story did not. Like the eponymous protagonist I, too, found myself counting pages toward the end of the novel. <br />
B000JLTRJ0|5.0|In the aftermath of 9-11 and the large assortment of videos and documentaries on the attacks and images, this movie is spectacular. I saw the WTC Towers burning and lost three best friends in those towers. This movie is inspiring and endearing. HEROES THAT LIVE!!! A truly positive movie. The tears of the audience were genuine and grateful that our world still has heroes who live, love and DEFEND our country!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I grew up listening to the Beatles on vinyl and never bought their albums on CD.  The first time I played the DVD-A version of the Love album I was really blown away.  The clarity and detail of the 5.1 image is truly remarkable.  Many of the songs have been remixed to produce unique results that nevertheless are 100% Beatles.  \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is especially beautiful.  This collection is a worthy addition to your Beatles library.

B000JJ4GW0|5.0|I don't know where to start but the bonus 'Live in Milan' blew me away ! It is much better than 'Vetigo : Live in Chicago' in all terms of 'Camera angel','Atmosphere','Tracklisting' and Bono's brilliant vocal ! All the tracks which are the same tracks as 'Live in Chicago' are much far better versions (Vertigo,Elevation,Sometimes you can't.., City of.. and Orginal of the species with orchestra band). Moreover, you will find the brilliant live version of 'I still have't...', 'All i want is you' and 'Miss Sarajevo' (You will surprise how Bono can sing Opera's part).  Stop bothering the complilation CD, since i've got this set i never listen to the CD as i am stuck with this brilliant bonus live dvd.  BUY IT !  BUY IT !  YOU WILL NOT DISAPPOINTED EVEN YOU ARE CASUAL FAN OF U2.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I had a couple of friends at school mention a certain scene from this movie and from that point on, I knew I had to get my hands on a copy. With the confusion on what this movie was about in the first place, I decided I had to figure the film out for myself. I was surprised to find it was a thoughtful, captivating movie that was about addiction, but delved much deeper than that.    Requiem for a Dream is a novel by author Hubert Selby Jr., written about the story of 4 characters in search of their own \\"American Dream\\". They are so jaded to what's going on in their lives and the path they're taking, each character experiences a type of addiction. For example, Harry's mother, Sarah Goldfarb, she is addicted to the television and later on \\"diet pills\\". Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel is able to connect to people through the characters in Requiem for a Dream that are so vulnerable to elements around them, when all they want to do is achieve something in today's society.    I believe that some people will be turned off by certain graphic scenes in Requiem for a Dream, but you have to remember that part of this book is about the addiction and dealing of drugs. The life of a user is not visually pretty, it does not make you feel emotionally at ease. The reason this movie is so powerful is because it causes you to feel so deeply about what you're experiencing and what the characters are experiencing in this movie. Requiem for a Dream should end and cause you to feel pity for Harry, his girlfriend Marion, Sarah Goldfarb and Tyrone, no matter how against drug use you are. I'm a strong advocate against drug use, but seeing such horrific stories makes you feel such deep pity for the characters.    I suggest that anyone interested in visually interesting movies to see Requiem for a Dream. It's dark and moody, fitting the story's whole plot. I suggest those who love a film with a good soundtrack to either watch Requiem for a Dream or to simply buy the soundtrack. It's main track, SummerOverture, has been used in such pieces of work as Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers movie trailer and various others.     I also suggest to anyone who's looking for a straight out pleasing, entertaining, gut-wrenching, tear jerking, all over surprising, spectacular and brilliant film to go and either rent or buy Requiem for a Dream.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I have no idea why but David Schwimmer the actor always makes my skin crawl when he is onscreen. I think his ability to play a leader is absolutely terrible. Maybe that's why he was cast. He is probably a nice guy but I just want to punch him when I see him.<br /><br />Other than that, this series is amazing.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|some people might have thought that with a Crow Left of The Murder,Incubus might have a lost a step in the ability to create Magic. With Light Grenades Incubus is in top form and has regained any step thought to be lost.    This CD is simply Amazing I Love it.. From the Slow soothing Love Hurts to the upbeat and chaotic Light Grenades this Album has it all.     Brandon's Vocals are in top form, Ben Kenney is amazing his bass skills sometimes push the song along such as in Anna Molly, Mike is awesome as always and the same can be said about Jose... Dj Kilmore is now playing Turntables, Hammond B3, Moog Voyager, Rhodes, Mellotron, Piano, Marxophone, Theramin.... Making his Live Setup... from two turntables (S.C.I.E.N.C.E. days) to three turntables, a cd turntable, a Moog Voyager, Rhodes , Theramin, Marxophone, and other piano type instruments. with this the sounds he produces out of each instrument makes this album all the better.     there is no need to go into depth breaking down each song as I am sure you have already read the majority of the previous reviews.    bottom line if you are speculating not buying this album you are missing out.. GO BUY IT its amazing along with each Incubus album.... \\"If your not Affected your not Paying Attention\\"...  \\"its too good not too have an effect\\"
B0000029GA|5.0|After listening to this album, it's not hard to see why Nas' 1994 debut album, \\"Illmatic\\", is considered to be a Hip-Hop classic. True fans of Nas & Hip-Hop don't need to read my review to know this album is nothing short of stellar, but for those of you who want to hear what REAL Hip-Hop sounds like, PURCHASE THIS ALBUM! <br /> <br />Thankfully, guest artists are kept to a minimum, allowing Nas to effectively flex his extraordinary abilities as a rapper and a lyricist. The anthemic \\"Represent\\" & the contemplative \\"Memory Lane\\" describe life on the streets with vivid detail over DJ Premier's minimalist production; songs like \\"N.Y. State Of Mind\\" & the self explanatory Nas/AZ rap collabo \\"Life's A B****\\" further display Nas' lyrical prowess and his dedication to Hip-Hop; and \\"One Love\\", despite a bland hook from track producer Q-Tip, is a deeply personal, heartfelt ode to old friends serving time in prison. As a whole, though, this album is practically flawless in terms of Nas' vocal delivery and lyrical ability. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there is a trait to this album that might turn some people off (apart from the fact that this album's only 10 tracks/35-38min. long) - the beats. Whether or not any of the beats have any inflections of jazz -like the jazz horns that drive the chorus of the justifiably boastful \\"Halftime\\", the majority of \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" or the conclusion of the bleak, previously mentioned \\"Life's A B****\\"- the beats tend to feel incomplete, undercooked or just plain boring. Fortunately, Nas is more than capable enough of holding the songs together with his compelling lyrics and fierce rapping, so the lack of power in the beat can be excused (unless the beats were deliberately softened so Nas' rapping and lyrics could be the main focus, but I might be wrong). <br /> <br />Altogether, \\"Illmatic\\" is a must-have for any true fan of Hip-Hop & Rap! 5 STARS! <br /> <br />5 Best Tracks (In No Order): <br />\\"The World Is Yours\\" <br />\\"Life's A B***(feat. AZ)\\" <br />\\"One Love (feat. Q-Tip)\\" <br />\\"N.Y. State Of Mind\\" <br />\\"Memory Lane\\" <br /> <br />N.B. For those of you who really care, every track on \\"Illmatic\\" contains one or more samples on other songs. That might also explain the jazz inflections on some of the songs. Also, jazz Musician Olu Daru, who is the father of Nas, plays the concluding horn on \\"Life's A B****\\".   <br />
0618680004|5.0|Dr. Dawkins is the bleach for the meme pool and this is the first treatment. On Amazon, I have read page after page after page of reviews that are one star that scream with dishonesty. It is blatantly obvious that they have not read the book and as another post by Baba Ed has pointed out, they do not return to defend their review. In fact, their reviews are nothing more than lies. I have been accused of being a \\"spokesperson\\" for Dawkins (because I read the book) by someone who admitted that they didn't read the book but needed to get their two cents in, well now it's my turn...<br /><br />The Bible may call atheists fools, but it also calls liars \\"fools!\\" Well a false review is a lie.<br /><br />Proverbs 10:18, \\"He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.\\"<br /><br />And let's add for good measure...<br /><br />Proverbs 14:5, \\"A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.\\"<br />Jeremiah 7:4, \\"Trust ye not in lying words,\\"<br /><br />And what punishment do liars get?<br /><br />Revelation 21:8, \\"...and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone\\"<br /><br />The Good Book:<br /><br />The God Delusion covers the spectrum from anger and hatred of atheists (p.211), dispelling the myth that Hitler was an atheist (p.272), addressing arguments for god(s) (lower case) existence (p.77), The undeserved respect afforded religion (p.20), literary culture of the Bible (p.340) to name but a few. My only real complaint with the book, and should be obvious to any reader from novice student to college professor is that the book tackles too much material. By doing so Dr. Dawkins didn't get into the heart of the matter as much as he could have. Unfortunately, with a book tackling such a vast subject (or non-subject depending on your point of view) each chapter could have easily been its' own book. The flip side of this point is that because of constraints on the size of the book some topics are streamlined and by doing so they make assumptions as to how much the reader already knows. This would include most atheists who may have read similar books but would exclude theists new to the subject matter. This concise and succinct method of presentation does work and does provide valuable insight into another point of view almost never heard outside of campus debates or publications such as Skeptic Magazine or Free Inquiry.<br /><br />However, some complaints about Dr. Dawkins approach are quite unfair. He is accused of \\"preaching\\", being \\"arrogant\\", saying he \\"whine(s)\\", or is \\"ranting\\" without evidence. What Dr. Dawkins has done is point out that as soon as religion becomes political, it is open for public debate and it should be and some people then become offended and cry foul. Simply read the reviews here and this will become self evident. And, when religion makes testable scientific claims (how old is the Earth, did man and animals evolve from a common ancestor, etc...) then, again, it is open to (public and scientific) debate. Again and again Dr. Dawkins points out that science is about facts and falsifying ideas that are incorrect in order to get to the truth, religion is strictly dogmatic faith which does not change. Just look the definition of faith: firm belief in something for which there is no proof. Unfortunately, those who are offended simply don't want to be embarrassed by being confronted with these questions. To paraphrase, ask a believer if they honestly believe in a \\"miracles\\" and their rational mind will cringe. Dr. Dawkins points out, this is usually condemned with attack calling his approach \\"so, nineteenth-century\\" (p.156), or something similar, which is code for \\"it's rude to ask me such a direct question for it will embarrass me\\". (My quote, not Dawkins)<br /><br />In brief, is this book worth reading? Yes. Is this book important? Also a resounding \\"Yes\\", because it is a splash of reason, or \\"Bleach for the Meme Pool\\" that is desperately needed. The faithful will attack without fail to defend their \\"Delusion\\" but as all the gaps are filled by science, god will find it harder and harder to stay relevant even to them and eventually he/she/it will fade away and reality, the real existence, will become apparent.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|ummm ok if someone could explain the plot to me i would enjoy this movie. actors are great everything is fine just what is this piece of trash about? where is the plot where is the story? in writting before you do anything you have to develp the plot and the storyline otherwise you have nothing. someone needs to teach the writer of this movie how to write and ok you can make people confused but at least explain it a litttle or leave them confused but at least have some reason why we are confused. this movie is just confuseing because theres no plot no reason for anything in this movie to happen. Matt Damons kid dies why? Groege Cloney gets kidnapped by terrorists why? things happen here but why? the story is suppose to serve the plot but here there is no plot so we just have a bunch of stories(5 of them) that make absolutley no sense at all.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Breakin' Up and Don't Get It Twisted are the only songs that are worthless. All the balads are wonderful, particularly 4 In the Morning. I feel this album is more balanced btwn uptempo and mid-tempos & Balads than LAMB. I do agree that a couple of the songs are very Hollaback Girl, but they work. With that said, from my understanding the majority of these tracks were those that didn't make L.A.M.B. therfore it is unfair to say that the album doesn't show \\"growth\\" or is a L.A.M.B. \\"wannabe.\\" The uptempo tracks took a couple listens to catch on but every ballad/mid-tempo track were great at first listen.   <br /> <br />Top Picks <br />Sweet Escape <br />Early Winter <br />4 In The Warning <br />Yummy
B000LC4CVA|4.0|I haven't seen the original Celtic Woman concert.  I watched this one on PBS, mainly because I wanted to see Hayley Westenra, one of my favourite singers.  To my surprise, Meav is one of the regular members of the group (I have two of her older albums).  So I was familiar with two of the singers already, even though I didn't realize it!  All the voices blended very nicely, and the harmonies were incredible.<br /><br />I would give this concert 5 stars, except that one song, \\"Sing Out\\", was very off-putting.  It was almost like Christian rock, and I really don't like that kind of music.  The concert recovered after that, though.<br /><br />I would definitely like to see this show again, but on DVD so I can skip through the song that I didn't like.
0156027321|5.0|The first half of _Life of Pi_ describes the experiences of a boy growing up as the son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, India.  While much of the narrative may seem fragmented at first, it is also very captivating.  One begins to feel a sense of close sympathy to the character of Pi Patel that few authors could provoke as masterfully as Yann Martel.  By the time the character of Pi is trapped on a lifeboat with a zebra, orangutan, hyena, and tiger, the reader feels every breath Pi takes, understands his actions and reactions, and one can not help but be moved by the fragments of situations the dynamic protagonist faces along with the unpredictable Richard Parker, even when things begin to become slightly absurd.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting because I could not put it down, and when I reached the end, I cried.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|When I saw Sarah McLachlan sing \\"River\\" on the Rockefeller Christmas Tree lighting special, I knew I had to have this cd.  I have at least 20 Christmas cd's from various recording artists and have since added this to my collection.  Her voice is so beautiful and haunting and it makes every song on this cd spectacular.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who: #1 -loves Sarah McLachlan, #2 -loves a more gentle sounding Christmas cd, and #3 -wants something that stand out as a truly unique Christmas cd.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|While the concept of lovers from different eras is hardly new (Bing Crosby's love of Arthurian-era Rhonda Fleming in \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\", Tyrone Power falling for Ann Blyth in Revolutionary War England in \\"I'll Never Forget You\\", and Christopher Reeve's bittersweet affair with Gilded Age beauty Jane Seymour in \\"Somewhere in Time\\", are just a few examples), the novelty of 'fated' lovers separated by two years, bonding through letters in a magical mailbox, gives \\"The Lake House\\" a unique poignancy all it's own.<br /><br />Certainly, there are leaps of logic to contend with (Sandra Bullock could have easily have tracked down Keanu Reeves at any point, without protracting their rendezvous an additional two years, her relationship with her boyfriend is never resolved, nor is the fate of Jack, the dog, who simply disappears), but taken on it's own terms, the film is a very satisfying and romantic odyssey. Reeves and Bullock, who had a wonderful, goofy chemistry in \\"Speed\\", prove than they can handle a deeper, more mature screen relationship very well, with Reeves giving one of his best performances, and Bullock, whose career had stalled after \\"Miss Congeniality\\", proving again that she is underrated as a dramatic actress.<br /><br />Based on the 2000 Korean film, \\"Il Mare\\", screenwriter David Auburn has given the production a 'Classic Hollywood' luster, with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman's \\"Notorious\\" playing on TV, and an ill-fated rendezvous reminiscent of \\"An Affair to Remember\\"; the presence of veteran star Christopher Plummer as Reeves' father enhances the 'feel'. While some may find this approach 'old-fashioned', Argentine director Alejandro Agresti recognized that a classic romance needed a classic approach, and, in my opinion, it succeeds quite well!<br /><br />\\"The Lake House\\" certainly deserves a look!
B00028HBKM|4.0|Movies do inspire and can bring the most heardened heart to a heart of conversion, miracles, and faith. this movie did exactly that. miracles took place because of this movie in people's lives. watch the miracles of the passion of christ a doccumentary to this film. even though this movie is not biblical, miriyam the mother of the masheeakh seeing the devil, yehudas the siccari (iscariot in latin), being tormented by demons appearing as children, the devil at the garden of gethsemane convincing the messiah there is not way he can bear the sins of others,the film did a great job when it comes to acting,language,cinematography,costuming, music,and directing.  <br />the crucifixion and flogging of ha masheeakh (the anointed one)is hard to watch and realistic to the core of what he really endured and died from. the ending of the film was fantastic. seeing a great white light coming from the pressence of a great mal'akh (angel) rolling the roman sealed rock away from the tomb with angelic music in the background, and then seeing the resurrection of the masheeakh with his wounds. iam jewish so seeing this film from that perspective is very difficult. the jewish community in america sensed the fear as did i that christian anit-semitism, anti-judaism would erupt into perseuction. toda hshem (thank G'd) no persecutions happened except for mel gibson's anti-jewish statment that we jews cause all the wars.  <br />not many people realize in the other film which is in this two dvd collection, when the crowd says \\"his blood be upon us and our children\\" that prophecy was fulfilled \\"she will give birth to a son and you are to name him yahshua (which means yah saves,)because he will save his people (israel)from their sins. ---matisyahu 21. well he did exactly that and the crowd not knowing said how they were to be saved. by the atoning blood and blood covenant of the masheeakh. great film you want to know the facts read the bible.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006AW2M|3.0|There's a few nuggets here that are worth having, but mostly this was a weak, almost guffaw-inducing attempt by the Rolling Stones to emulate the Beatles post-Sgt Pepper. Probably a cash move, to capitalize on the psychedelic sound. Awesome title, but the music is psych-lite and the sentiments are all loveydovey and have very little to do with satanic majesties.  <br /> <br />This is one of the few classic Stones albums that does not stand the test of time, but perhaps for its awkwardness in the catalog it is worth a buy for curiosities' sake. Any review saying that this is better than Sgt Pepper is merely contrarian; this disc is fairly horrid standing next to Pepper.
B000FQ4M58|1.0|I was skeptical when I bought this CD, and my gut instincts were proven to be valid.  This album sucks.  The original BOOH is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest albums of all times.  Also, I am a big Queen fan and think Brian May is perhaps the best guitarist of all times.  I also like Steve Vai.  As a teenager, I was a fan of Motley Crue (at least their first 3 albums) and was intrigued that Nikki Sixx co-wrote a song.    But it's all smoke and mirrors.  The only high point on this disappointing CD is Marion Raven's voice.  SHE can sing!  Everything else is over-prodouced, over-dramatic and under-performing.    Borrow a friend's copy of this CD before spending $14 for your own copy.  It'll be like renting a Hyundai (or some other crappy car) for the weekend before deciding to buy one.  You'll be glad you did.    This CD is crap I tell you... pure, unadulterated [...].
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|First, I think the actors did a find job with their roles; my issue is with the directorial decisions that made no sense. I had no problem with how the Bennett family was portrayed, and I even liked the rougher more unwashed look of the dancers at the minor balls -- in a world where bathing was a luxury, I can imagine that flyaway hair would be more natural than perfectly coiffed locks. <br /> <br />The pacing was much too fast. I realize that it's a lot of story to fit into 2 hours, which is why it perhaps should not have been attempted. Today's life moves at breakneck speeds, but life in the nineteenth century would have been much slower, especially for families of their status. <br /> <br />I do not understand the re-characterization of Mr. Bennett at all. In the book he's a quietly powerful figure stuck in a loveless marriage. When he speaks to Elizabeth at the end, he mentions the unhappiness of marrying someone you cannot respect, a direct allusion to his own situation. This movie portrays him as hen-pecked and even shows tenderness to his wife -- completely out of character with the original where he barely tolerates her silliness. To bolster this illustration of Mr. Bennett, some of his best lines are given to other roles. For example, Elizabeth challenges Mr. Collins as to whether his effusions are thought out ahead of time or the result of the moment. Elizabeth would never be so impertinent to a guest at her father's table, especially one with the power to put them out of their house! <br /> <br />And lastly, Lady Catherine came calling in the middle of the night? I think not! There is nothing on earth that would have provoked a woman of such strict pride and ostentatious rectitude to arrive at the home of someone so far beneath her in the dark of night. It would be unheard of. <br /> <br />If you don't care about the original story or its integrity and/or just want to get through it, please feel free to watch this. But if you want to know the real story,please read the book or watch the BBC production with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
1933784032|5.0|This book is a beautiful work of art in itself.  It is a wonderful read, but just as importantly, the quantity of detailed photos makes it a fun book to flip through.  Turn to any page and you will find a gem of visual effects history.  Worth every penny, a great book to have on display.
B00005JOYM|3.0|The real-life story of Port Authority officers caught up in the 9/11 tragedy opens with quiet and realistic descriptions of their jobs in New York. The whole tragedy is depicted as seen from the viewpoints of these hard-working officers and their families, and the film is given strength because of this narrative approach as far as its opening 30 minutes go. <br /> <br />One of the film's horrifying scenes is, of course, the first chapters where the panic is shown after two airplanes hit the Twin Towers. Oliver Stone presents us what we witnessed on TV then from another viewpoint - I don't repeat it here - and though it is true that he restrained himself from showing too much, he still seems to have been tempted. I can say the scenes of the officers arriving World Trade Center is realistic, and maybe too realistic to some. <br /> <br />Nicholas Cage with low-key performance plays Jim McLoughlin, real-life officer who knows the place better than anyone. What happened to Jim McLoughlin, Will Jimeno, another actual person (played by Michael Peña) and other officers of the rescue team is described next, which is simply terrifying. The story of the film's earlier part is told fast and straightforward, and what they experienced is conveyed convincingly to us. <br /> <br />And then, after the collapse of the buildings the film starts to use another narrative technique, switching between the officers trapped underground and their families waiting at home. Then things get a little - how should I say? - not good. I respect those people involved in the filmmaking, but why Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello? Or why Nicholas Cage in the first place? I am not talking about their talent (which I am ready to admit), but no matter what they do, their faces are recognizable as Maggie, Maria and Nicholas. Somewhere in my mind I feel they are acting.  <br /> <br />And this is the part I disagree with the film. Though `World Trade Center's is based on true story, it sometimes makes us feel otherwise. Though its timeline is compressed, the story gets slow and some images look clichéd. Maybe I should not say this, I know, but the frequent flashbacks showing the happy days, the film's big visual and sound effects and occasional soundtrack music are clearly those of Hollywood films. I'm not saying that Hollywood studios are all bad; I can feel the goodwill of the people involved in making this film. I'm only saying that there may be another approach better than the one employed here: no `stars,' no effects, just facts. <br /> <br />This leads us to the inevitable comparison with `United 93.' It is not fair to compare them because these two incidents are not the same, yes, I know, but I need to do it to make my point. Paul Greengrass succeeded in shooting his film about the hijacked airplane which is emotionally involved by making it very lean. And Oliver Stone's film is also lean and effective up until the moment when the film attempts to tell another story -- story about the family, which, I think, needs and deserves another film to tell. <br /> <br />`World Trade Center' has moving scenes as well as very disturbing ones. Despite its undeniable merits, however, you will feel the film is uneven and perhaps a bit sentimental. As to the sentimentality, I confess that I also shared the feeling while watching, but I still don't know if I was right in feeling that way.
0345475674|2.0|I enjoyed Harris' \\"Fatherland\\", but I'm afraid I can't recommend \\"Pompeii\\".  The plot was linear and predictable and the one-dimensional characters were just not very interesting.  For a historical novel I expected more insights into Roman thought and culture, but those aspects of the book were pretty superficial. <br /> <br />It's not a horrible book, but it's just fluff.  Fuff with a touch of history, but fluff nonetheless.  I expected better.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is the best movie about Pan yet to be shown.  It is magical, whimsical, fun, and exciting.  The cast fits the roles better than any other cast of Peter Pan I have ever seen.  This is the true fairytale we all pictured when we were young.
0393327655|5.0|There is a point of maturity in which one grows from the childish delusions of faith to a world view with much more integrity. Sam Harris certainly speaks of this transition well. What I'd like like to hear more of, and what is sorely lacking, is writers seriously considering the ramifications of life without god. Jerome FitzGeralds visions of a meaningful life without god really fill this void, but I'd love to hear more.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I have a confession to make; I do not like Gwyneth Paltrow. It's not because she is anti-American, or that she fakes a British accent every chance she gets, it's not even because she named her children Apple and Moses therefore subjecting them to a lifetime of fruit and biblical jokes. I don't like her because she is not a good actress, it's as simple as that, and it's all my opinion of course because some people think she is the next Meryl Streep (laughs uncontrollably). Having stated this, I will say that I loved this Movie! Yes, I could even look past Miss Paltrow to see the merits of this film. I had seen the coming attractions, and said \\"no\\" because of Gwyneth, even though it looked really interesting. Finally I broke down and told myself \\"it has robots, and planes, and Jude and Angelina\\" and in the universe that I live in all those things counteract her. She isn't horrible in this, she is just as staccato, and blank faced as she usually is, but it works for her character. Jude Law is okay, as well as Angelina, the script really didn't allow for any Oscar moments, the REAL star of this movie was the Special Effects. The whole movie was just gorgeous and creative; it's like no movie I have ever witnessed. If you are a fan of old black and white movies, classic Sci Fi and just plain originality you will love it.
0966638328|5.0|At the beginning of the book, the author offers a brief overview of psychological and emotional impact of individual colors (red, pink, oranga, yellow, brown, blue, green, purple, white and black), and then follows the section with different color combinations.  Color combinations are sorted out according to the impact they would have upon the viewer and what mood would they convey (e.g. serene, earthy, mellow, powerful, spiritual, romantic, sensual, elegant, playful, energetic, etc). The author also suggests products and services where particular colors may be best suited or where some colors are best avoided.<br /><br />While the psychological and emotional impact of colors is not exhaustive in this book, it is interesting enough to get you intrigues to further look into it elsewhere.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I have over 50 boxed set DVDs and without a doubt, this is the most exquisite!  It is sturdy and has a gleaming gold exterior that does not begin to show up in the picture featured here at all.  If you are thinking of a holiday gift, THIS is the one to choose.  Also, it ships very nicely and the DVDs are packaged in a way so that they don't fall out.<br /><br />That said, I will add my comments to the other reviews regarding the show itself.  I had actually never seen the show prior to ordering this set.  But I kept hearing all the hype about it and I have to say that the series is absolutely one of the very best.<br /><br />JJ Abrams of Lost fame created and wrote for the show and I have to say that Lost and Alias are two of my top three television series.  What a genius!<br /><br />I grew up in the 60's watching \\"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" and of course James Bond, and I loved this series about a young woman who erroneously has been led to believe that she works for a covert division of the CIA.  Moreover, the writers do not have the viewers just blindly accepting that this woman is a \\"super spy\\" with extraordinary powers.  Instead, they give a very plausible rationale for her extreme gifts in the world of espionage.<br /><br />LOL  I have to admit that if I could be any fictional character from a television series....it would have to be Sydney Bristow.  Jennifer Gardner just made this character come alive.  I would love to have an alter ego = female spy fighting for the \\"good guys.\\"<br /><br />Although I previously liked Jennifer Garnder and thought she was a pretty good actress on the big screen, Alias made me realize what an absolutely amazing and talented actress she is.<br /><br />Likewise, ALL the actors in the series are SO awesome.  Of course, Michael Vartan is great and played his part beautifully but I thought that the performance by Kevin Weisman who played Marshall was incredible. Absolutely nailed his character down pat.<br /><br />This boxed set also include a HARDCOVER little book about Alias as well.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Arguably the worst product ever from Gwen.  Her lyrics and beats are bland at best.  Its a feeble attempt to hold onto her dying Hip Hop career.  I do not recomend it.
B00000I8UF|4.0|If you like your jazz beefy with clean sophisticated phrasing. Smoothe & sparkling. Refined,designed, classy. This disc is it! My only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars would be my preference for jazz that's a little more experimental. That said this disc is first rate!
B000H30B2C|5.0|This DVD realy does set the standard for what a Special Edition DVD should be. <br /> <br />Buy it now.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|I'm a huge Beatles Fan.... I grew up singing their songs while in the car with my mom. This CD might sound great on stage with Cirque du Soleil but at work at my desk it really sucks... give me the real songs full lenght and original. This mish mash of sound has nothing but made me want to hold to my old cds..<br /><br />Great songs in this CD but terrible mix...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie, and the series, are all about the characters.  It's a scifi spaghetti western, but the characters make you want to be a member of this crew.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I too don't know what's in the water bottles of the bad reviewers, but just like everyone else, I am/was a big Beatle fan, and I think this mix is OUTSTANDING. Just as Lennon (and whoever else) threw together snippets for Rev. #9, I'd like to think that this is a project the group would do as well. What a blast George and Gils Martin must have had in producing this! I highly recommend this \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"! <br /> <br />Speaking of George Martin, did anyone catch the wonderful stringed orchestra playing \\"Carry That Weight\\" at the end of the UK Hall of Fame show? What a GREAT job he did, and what an AWFUL pair of singers they chose for the vocals!! Who were these nobodies?!! Neither could sing worth a damn, and couldn't even get close to the high notes! If in my power, I would have fired whoever chose them. <br /> <br />Patrick <br />
B000JK8OYU|1.0|That's great that they're trying to make The Beatles appealing to the new generations. . .too bad they already ARE!<br /><br />I heard about this project earlier and thought maybe it was going to be great, then I realized it has nothing to do with the surviving members and OOOOOH their old producer had a hand in it. big deal. as you can see with \\"Let it be. . .Naked\\" the surviving members didn't care for what became the original \\"Let it be\\" so much, that they had to re-release it the way it was SUPPOSED to be. How's that for producing? This album is just a Medley that is irritating to me. the song pairings they have don't go well together. Pay attention to the lyrics and tell me they do. I tried, I seriously tried to listen to this, but it was annoying to know that the only reason it came out was because of Cirque de Soleil, not because of the Beatles. George Martin didn't make the Beatles who they are. he's a hack. this album proves it. his \\"cut and paste\\" job does nothing for the music. I'd rather listen to the originals rather than listen to this drivel that \\"REMINDS\\" me of the originals. Pick this up if you're only a casual fan that needs a medley of their hits to remember what they sang. Don't pick this up if you're a purist. it'll be a waste of money.
B000002LND|1.0|You'd have to search pretty hard to find anyone as self serving and putrid as Madonna, a woman with an ego so big that its a surprise she ever gets through the studio door. This is her best of. She even calls it 'immaculate' it is not. It is full of the most lame, one dimensional music it has ever be my misfortune to assail my poor hearing too. For months i had to endure this whilst serving in a clothes shop. I doubt if i've yet to recover. There is no redeeming features in this dross. Musically it all sounds the same, the woman can't write and worse she sings out of key. You'd think after the mind numbing 'holiday' it couldn't get any worse, but it does. By track three (if you can stomach what went before) you are wondering if you are losing your sanity, by the end you are thanking God for salvation. And she has made millions from this. Madonna even this psuedonym is a joke. Oh yeah and she advocates wearing fur-say no more! Ego on!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Originally written edited April 14, 2005:  There is no other like Mariah. It's like listening to an Angel sing. Her voice is unique from all the other power house female vocalists. It's powerful but at the same time has an innocence, softness, clarity, beauty, and tranquil quality that is so completely mesmerizing. She is unparalleled. This is why no contestant on AI has ever attempted to sing one of her songs. Mariah is simply untouchable. She is an amazing talent that can sing, but can also write & produce her own songs and has done so from the start of her career. She debuted at #1 her 1st week on billboard. As for all the haters.... screw'em....it's not worth wasting my time. I just skip over their reviews, because obviously they need hearing aids. First, I think this is the best album of her career. It's hard to decifer because I love them all, but MC has really hit the jackpot with this one. It's a real work of art that offers an assortment of beautiful ballads and addictive dance/club/R&B tracks. Her next single should be either \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", or \\"Stay the Night\\". As always her genuine & sincere lyrics are well written, mature, articulate, and conveyed with pure emotion. I also love the angel-like look of the cd cover. She looks absolutely beautiful. As I previously mentioned, I have alot of respect for Mariah because she is the only superstar songstress that utilizes every aspect of her talent in writing and producing her songs (w/ the exception of Christina[Stripped] who is beginning to). This cd is magnificent. GO BUY THE CD & LETS CONTINUE THE #1 REIGN ON THE CHARTS. GO OUT & GET IT NOW!!!!! YOU WILL LOOOOOOOOVE IT.....I'M BACK.... SHE HAS SLIPPED TO #2 ON THE BILLBOARD THE 2ND WEEK, WHICH IS STILL RESPECTFUL.... BUT WE NEED TO HELP HER REBOUND BACK TO # 1.....PASS THE WORD....WE HAVE TO SUPPORT HER.... <br />Update: <br />You must get the Platinum addition, whihc includes 4 additional tracks.  If you get it at Target it includes an additional track that is inclusive to Target stores.  The track is \\"Sprung\\"....I cannot understand why this track was not included with the Platinum addition.  It is one of my favorites.  The beat is so funky, smooth, and is completely off the hook.  I recommend getting the Platinum addition at Target to get the \\"Sprung\\" track.  Believe me you will be \\"Sprung\\" out of your seat and onto the dance floor. <br />
B000J3EEBY|5.0|The wait was really long, but \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is definitely worth buying & listening. Almost an hour of perfect music: what more can you ask? Loreena goes more \\"political\\" here: songs like \\"Caravanserai\\", \\"The English Ladye And The Night\\" and \\"Beneath A Phrygian Sky\\" demonstrate that Loreena hopes for integration, peace and protection of diversity. \\"There's much more to bind us than to tear us apart\\", she writes in the introduction to the album contained in the booklet; \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is a hymn to the power of love and a desperate cry, calling out for peace and asking all humanity to raise up for that. <br /> <br />\\"Incantation\\": great opening track, it brings you straight to the atmosphere of the whole album. It reminds me of the old times, somehow it sounds as \\"violent\\" as \\"Blacksmith\\" from \\"Elemental\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Gates Of Istanbul\\": the intro is very very fine, but when Loreena starts singing it's even better. Maybe it's just a little too long, but the closing part of the song with Loreena singing \\"na na na ni na....\\" is wonderful . <br /> <br />\\"Caravanserai\\": absolutely great intro. Absolutely great track. Well chosen as the first single. <br /> <br />\\"The English Ladye And The Knight\\": the boys choir is a most successful choice, and the strings are most touching. And, it goes without saying, Loreena's voice is more perfect than ever. The lyrics are stunning, it reminds me of \\"The Lady Of Shalott\\". Sir Walter Scott would be delighted, I think.   <br /> <br />\\"Kecharitomene\\": my least favourite on the album (up to now). I have to listen to it some more times; it has not impressed me as the other tracks (up to now). The crescendo is fine, but I find it a little too repetitive. The inspiration behind this track is one of the best on the album, though. <br /> <br />\\"Penelope's Song\\": the theme of steadfast love is set out better than in \\"The Highwayman\\". I love it when Loreena says \\"And in the night when our dreams are still...\\". Her voice in this trackis kind of magic. <br /> <br />\\"Sacred Shabbat\\": I like this song much more than \\"Kecharitomene\\", talking about instrumentals. It's sort of \\"tango\\". <br /> <br />\\"Beneath A Phrygian Sky\\": this one deserves to be a single (maybe the second single after \\"Caravanserai\\"?). Loreena goes \\"political\\": I like it. The lyrics and the liner notes are full of wisdom. <br /> <br />\\"Never-ending Road (Amhràn Duit)\\": this is the most heartfelt track on the album, and one of the most heartfelt ever! Loreena's high notes are more moving than ever, but lower notes are stunning as well. The closing part of the song, and of the album, is well conceived: it says \\"it's over, the muse has shut up shop\\", if you allow me to use this sharp metaphor. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The Visit\\" is hard to beat, it will always be my favourite album; however, \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is now close second: it's surely better than \\"The Book Of Secrets\\", which already was a magnificent work.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|If you are looking for a CD to pop in your car and bump to before a party or on a road trip then you should buy The Sweet Escape. However, if you are looking for a unique sound AND growth of an artist then you should probably bypass this one. I am a big fan of Gwen from her No Doubt days, and I even remained a fan after the schizophrenic experience of Love. Angel. Music. Baby and the overkill of \\"Hollaback Girl.\\" But sadly, this is just another example of another pop/rock artist trying to ride the hip hop wave, pimp Pharrell from The Neptunes, and sell some music. Even though Gwen is able to wear the transition well with her beauty and individual personal style, the sound is still generic and over-produced. Most of the songs sound the same--big bass beats mixed with a voice not suited for the music behind it. In my opinion, Gwen needs to get back with No Doubt and start from scratch. Sure she can make more money on her own, but it should be more about quality at this stage in her career.
B000003N8R|5.0|I have almost all of the records of Coltrane on LP,now in Cd.To understand his music and development you must know He has 4 phases, The first pre atlantic, the second on Atlantic.

1845763653|5.0|first off...this is great book in many ways ..presented in a most professional and clean manner, a publishing work of art to go with the works of art inside....the history of Stan and his team of talents is vast and covered very well in text and of course with images to amaze... the design, constuction and presentation of the art of Special make-up effects in the films that have become icons and benchmarks for fx artists to admire and try to outdo, well they are all there, of course there could always be more details and more information but any book of this scale is going to be marketed to a broader audience than myself and my peers in the fx world, but this book does a wonderful job of presenting what we do and what we would love to acheive in very warm and fun light.<br /> Thanks to Stan for being the ring leader of such a talented circus of artists!<br /> Anthony Veilleux, Make-up fx artist
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This is about the cover of the DVD. The people who most need to be educated about global warming live on the rich Northern half of the planet. In the northern hemisphere, storms rotate COUNTERclockwise. What idiot did the graphic showing the hurricane rotating clockwise? And what moron approved it? Al Gore should be wondering why these people are sabotaging his credibility, and right there on the cover of the DVD, no less! Fire them, and correct the cover!     (The same thing happened with the film, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". I counted all the times that they had storms in the northern hemisphere rotating clockwise. It was over 50% of the time, and there were a lot of storms! That ruined the movie for me.)     SO, if and when the DVD cover graphic is fixed, I will likely change my rating of the DVD. Right now it flunks just because of the stupid graphic on the cover. Hasn't ANYBODY besides me noticed it?
0743298020|4.0|I picked this book up in the store because it featured books on it's cover and I bought it because the excerpt on the back intriqued me.  The book lived up to my expectations of an excellent read - though there were a few frightening pages when I feared it would end unsatisfactorily.  A great read for a cold or rainy day by the fire!  Don't plan to do anything but read and sip hot tea.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Prior to my getting this CD I came to Amazon and read customer reviews. Like many of you I was weary about how the music would sound smashed up and remixed and wondered if I would like it. I doubted that true die-hard Beatles fans would like it but I took a chance and got it. I tell you now that IT IS GREAT!! Nearly all of the songs kept their original sound with a little frills added to them but, it all sounds great the way they were mixed up!! I consider this to be a tribute album except it is the FAB4 singing and not some tribute band. It is a tribute to the hundreds of GREAT songs that these great men wrote and sang with all of their heart. I even read an article that Olivia Harrison, Yoko Ono, Ringo, and Paul all had some input into the creation of this album and that they all loved it! That article alone is what convinced me that I wanted to get the CD. I had trust in what the two remaining Beatles were supporting - if they liked it then I had no doubt that I would.
B00004YA0T|2.0|The EMI box set of Bruckner symphonies conducted by Jochum receives a lot of praise, and, due to its very low price (at time of writing), is a first choice for listeners who are just beginning to get into Bruckner. These new listeners, having little basis for comparison, add their own praises, and so the cycle continues. An incautious purchaser might really believe that they are buying \\"the best of the best\\" for only $[price]. Well, perhaps, in their case, they might be. After all, once we can take technical competence for granted, we can only really argue based on our personal tastes. Can Jochum's (or anyone's) performances _objectively_ be called \\"the best\\"? No.<br /><br />Though you'd hardly know it from the reviews below, not everyone rates Jochum at the top of Bruckner interpreters, and even if they do, they may not rate these recordings as representing his best work. My own feeling is that Jochum is a terrible Bruckner conductor: his rhythms are weak, his phrasing is haphazard, his rhetorical gestures are all wrongheaded (speeding up when he should slow down and vice versa) and lack emotional conviction, and his performances lack the \\"magic\\" that other conductors can bring to these transcendent works. Also, the Dresden brass in these recordings often sound like a chorus of kazoos (!), and there is definite weakness in the trumpets.<br /><br />Jochum's admirers will strongly disagree, but I think they _might_ agree that, for listeners whose tastes will not tolerate these performances, there do exist valid (albeit more expensive) alternatives. Karajan's box set is rightly called a landmark, with B6 the only weak link. Haitink's set is a classic. Wand is certainly worth listening to. Tintner's performances of rarely-heard versions are of more than academic interest. Barenboim's Berlin set is a bit of an acquired taste but undeniably sounds great. Solti is energetic and enjoyable. There are others I haven't mentioned - and then there are discs of individual recordings, unavailable in box sets, which are arguably where the real Bruckner gold is to be found.<br /><br />So you may agree or disagree with my assessment of Jochum's EMI set. But before you put your hard-earned money into this purchase, at least compare a few of the samples available here at Amazon. You may find that other performances are more satisfying to you. Or perhaps less satisfying. Either way, you owe it to yourself to check these things out yourself, and not just rely on popular opinion.<br /><br />[Note: As of 4 June 2012, Karajan's set is significantly cheaper than Jochum, and should be the preferred option.]ings, unavailable in box sets, which are arguably where the real Bruckner gold is to be found.<br /><br />So you may agree or disagree with my assessment of Jochum's EMI set.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Prior to my getting this CD I came to Amazon and read customer reviews.  Like many of you I was weary about how the music would sound smashed up and remixed and wondered if I would like it.  I doubted that true die-hard Beatles fans would like it but I took a chance and got it. I tell you now that IT IS GREAT!!  Nearly all of the songs kept their original sound with a little frills added to them but, it all sounds great the way they were mixed up!!  I consider this to be a tribute album except it is the FAB4 singing and not some tribute band.  It is a tribute to the hundreds of GREAT songs that these great men wrote and sang with all of their heart.  I even read an article that Olivia Harrison, Yoko Ono, Ringo, and Paul all had some input into the creation of this album and that they all loved it!  That article alone is what convinced me that I wanted to get the CD.  I had trust in what the two remaining Beatles were supporting - if they liked it then I had no doubt that I would.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|This review isn't for me to tell you how great the movie is, it's strictly to tell you about the quality of this disc. This movie is a love it or hate it movie. I personally really liked the movie. I think if you go in expecting sockless loafers and hot pink suits, you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Now, I'd just like to say that the picture quality of this disc is absolutely stunning. There were several moments where my mouth dropped in sheer disbelief at the beautiful images on the screen. If the HD/DVD combo disc actually looks better, I'm gonna have to see it for myself to believe it. One of the best looking discs of the year, hands down.<br /><br />Sound is pretty nice also. There are several action sequences where the gunshots pack a nice, clean punch and will work your speakers out a bit. Music and dialogue is all clear as well but if I had to make a suggestion, I'd say watch the movie with the subtitles on. The talk gets so technical at times in terms of police procedure that at times you might be left scratching your head or reaching for your remote to rewind the last five minutes of dialogue. Try it and see.<br /><br />I liked the extras on the disc and while it's not as expansive as I would've liked, it does have a great Michael Mann commentary.<br /><br />This is a nice DVD to show off your system with. Whether or not you enjoyed the movie is on you but if you did, I'd say put your money on this one.
0790732254|1.0|I was appalled, but not surprised, to find that this Warner Bros DVD was almost inaudible when I played it. It's got the same truly dumb Dolby Digital (only - no PCM) audio set up as for \\"Blow Up\\" and \\"Death In Venice\\". They all offer \\"1.0\\" ONLY - and even then it's at about one fifth the volume it needed to be.  <br /> <br />I cannot believe that Warner Bros didn't see the clear logic that even a mono film should be encoded as 2.0 at the very least, but having the volume so low is not only totally inept - it shows complete disregard for the consumer. It is necessary that the volume of DVD's be relatively uniform - otherwise pressing \\"stop\\" while playing this DVD on your DVR (with inbuilt tuner) might just see your expensive speakers die in one almighty blast of whatever televison channel it was tuned to. <br /> <br />A good example of how a mono soundtrack can be used to best advantage on DVD in Dolby Digital is \\"A Night To Remember\\" - which makes effective use of both front and centre speakers (in 3.0). Many people these days will be hearing their DVD's through surround sound systems - so why on earth would anyone design sound to come from the center speaker only?    <br /> <br />I've no doubt that this is a great film - but my ability to enjoy it in this particular DVD format has been hugely discounted. Warner Bros deserve a good slap.
B000ION79Y|1.0|Why doesn't Amazon have negative stars?  This one would get a -5.  Words do not decribe how horrible this movie was.  I feel dumber for having watched this.  Exactly one hour, 34 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
0440242576|1.0|Although the first half of the book was easy and pleasant enough to hold my attention, the second half was horrible.  I just finished the book and I have a raging headache.  The plot arche is bad enough, the the racist sub-plot just made the whole thing intolerable.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|Without the visual show to accompany this, I find it to be pretty pointless. The sound isn't all that \\"improved\\", the collages not that interesting, (to me anyway...)It just makes me want to listen to the original recordings and wait to see the performances that accompany this project. I'm certain that the spectacle taken as a whole will be far more rewarding than this hash.
1563890119|4.0|Collected in this volume are the first eight issues of Gaiman and company's The Sandman.  \\"Sleep of the Just\\" introduces us to this revamped character--not a super-hero--but the lord of dreams who is captured no less, by an occultist.  A proficient horror story. <br /> <br />The next six issues dealt with Morpheus' quest to re-assemble his tools.  \\"Imperfect Hosts\\" sets the stage; \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" pairs him with John Constantine (who was also new to the DC Vertigo line at that time) as he searches for his pouch of dreams.  In the quest for his helm, Morpheus travels to hell to battle a demon in \\"A Hope in Hell.\\"  While the bulk of the battle is reminiscent of other stories of characters battling a demon, the ending has a nice twist.  The next three installments (\\"Passengers,\\" \\"24 Hours,\\" and \\"Sound and Fury\\") document Morpheus' battle with Dr. Destiny (a small-time villian from DC super-hero titles).  While \\"24 Hours\\" does work as a horror story on its own, the entire set of tales reads more like a standard super-hero comic--Morpheus, the good-guy, versus Dr. Destiny, the bad guy.   <br /> <br />The final story in this volume, \\"The Sound of Her Wings,\\" introduces us to Morpheus' older sister Death.  Instead of a morbid grim-reaper type character, Gaiman's version of Death is of a lively Goth-chic, and if anything, full of life.   <br /> <br />Some may find the art for this series not to their taste.  None of it is realistic--but then one could argue this series was about anything but realism.  For example, the characters are often misshapen or drawn as a caricature.  This can be effective at times, but at other times, it seems sloppy and serves the story poorly.   <br /> <br />Overall, I still find myself liking and enjoying these stories after nearly twenty years.  While the stories may not seem so revolutionary or original now (just think of the state of the comic industry in the late 1980s), they are still good stories that are competently told and drawn.   <br />
B000JRYOPG|5.0|I loved this movie and I am so glad it will have a legit American release. It is violent at times but still entertaining and emotional. I recommend this to anyone who loves gangster movies.
B00003CXXS|4.0|I think this film surpasses the previous 2 in its classic presentation of events. The first film was more about the technology and comes off as a Disney ride. The second is a jumbled mess....both are overlong. Jurassic Park III is old-fashioned storytelling laced with just the right amount of humor. William H. Macy is his usual terrific self and, the rest of the cast blends perfectly together. The screenplay is lean and to the point, unfolding in a linear manner with many thrills hooked to it. The trip down the river, in the small boat, is right out of a Joseph Conrad novel of the early 20th century. I highly recommend this most enjoyable 90 minute adventure.
055358202X|2.0|This book was indeed bloated, not with needless words, but with whole needless chapters!  It contains literally hundreds of pages of virtually nothing but people wandering from place to place with no action, no plot advancement, no character development and devoid even of interesting dialogue.  Ok, that's a bit harsh, but from a \\"The Master\\" it's just rude.   <br /> <br />This would be a disappointing book from even an unkown author, but for GRRM it's a slap in the face to his fans.  I suggest waiting until the \\"second half\\" of it comes out and hope by some miracle it makes up for this yawn-fest.  Also, buy the paperback because you'll get so frustrated you'll want to slam the book into your head.
B000002INJ|2.0|On here called Pleasure Slave. It talks about woman needing nothing more than to suck ManOwar. Muscles aside, any good music is seriously just undermined by that. I dug some of their stuff. I have their jacket,shirts. Racial crap on Violence and Bloodshed shrugged to but nomore..Guess there venting. I'll listen to the album and see if I can change my mind. Had to delete good \\"Fighting the World review. Give it a shot, and see if they change..Extra star given for \\"Defenders\\" on \\"fighting.\\"..Could just be a venting..
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I liked this movie enough to buy it after watching it.  IT's not an action movie and in ways it is not hyper-dramatic. It plods along at a pace that matches the nordic scenery. There is enough action in it - and drama - to keep a person watching. What I liked about it best was the imagry and at times the humor. I also like the story and the acting. Yeah, I guess I liked everything about it.
B00005JPB4|2.0|not a typical war movie, only with the trade mark of clint eastwood: slow, very slow, and a badly scripted zigzag screenplay. you must have a very strong and blind patriotism to like this bad movie, no matter what. some cosmetic battle scenes, then back to america in pressed uniforms, party, dancing, hotel hoppings, some big words  speeches, applauds, women blindly adored those flag-posting gis and chasing them everywhere, shaking hands again and again all over the places. huggings, teary eyes...ma'm, johnny was my best buddie...yes, sir. what else we got here? nothing. a very hollow movie that only gave a very subtle hint to the audience, but most of them might not realize even they successfully completed their viewing in the theater: what you called war heroes were nothing but bunch of chosen models to show to the american public during tough time of the war, allowed them got something to hold unto, gave them some hopes, even those hopes were just for commercial purposes.
0767818040|4.0|As cinemaphiles know, Brian De Palma has a thing for paying homage to Hitchcock in his films. Here he tries to channel Hitchcock's affinity for themes of sexual dysfunction, shocking plot twists and character \\"sudden death\\", which make the masters films extremely watchable until this day. But De Palma also has a taste for the \\"low-life\\" that Hitchcock could not truly explore back when, and really exercises the id here with this wild allegory on Hollywood, psycho-babble and the world of porno. Body Double is one of the seminal (no pun intended) 80's erotic thrillers (right up there with Fatal Attraction, Sea of Love and De Palma's Dressed to Kill), and a fun, trashy view.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a failing actor (who could use some serious couch time, if you know what I mean), who becomes obsessed with \\"the girl next door\\" - a sexy neighbor whose `jones' for late-night dancing in the \\"all-together\\" and abhorrence for window blinds makes house-sitting worth the lousy pay. And as we've seen in dozens of erotic thrillers, someone dies, someone is accused, and our hero must save the girl and get the bad guy. Nice twists along the way keep this one very intriguing (though some \\"haters\\" will surely say they figured this one out long before the credits roll). What makes this film unique and a great view are:<br /><br />A spectacularly hot, 28 year old Melanie Griffith, who about steals the movie and registers a \\"'10' on the peter meter\\" whenever she's on-screen.<br /><br />The beautiful mystery brunette (Deborah Shelton) with unbelievable bedroom eyes.<br />Tons of sexy skin, stripping and erotic situations that'll get your blood going.<br />Great inside-the-movie-biz references, including a plunge into LA's adult film under-world.<br />Fine performances by the actors, with a story that reels you in and sound direction by De Palma.<br />An appearance by 80s group Frankie Goes to Hollywood, performing \\"Relax\\" (that song never gets old to me, at least).<br /><br />Sure, there are elements of real, American \\"cheese\\" here; leaps in logic (the plot tenuously hinges on a couple \\"convenient\\" things happening at just the right time) and an overall \\"over-the-top\\" feel will turn some viewers off and have them scrambling for the remote. But Body Double is truly one of those late night cable classics that many have duplicated, but few have surpassed. It has just enough art, just enough schlock and just enough brains to keep your attention - and did I mention Melanie Griffith?
0716736241|2.0|For me, the utility of a chemistry text is defined in simple terms. Does it help me complete the homework assignments? Does it explain things in a way that my professor does not? Does it stand alone, apart from the instruction of my professor? <br /> <br />I took an Inorganic course to fill a deficiency and so I bought this book. I found it to be very disappointing. The explanations of key concepts (such as term symbols and crystal field theory) is lacking and the problems that the text works out seem esoteric and too terse for someone trying to connect the dots. <br /> <br />I like the Tarr and Mieslier text better.

B00005JPDJ|4.0|As a guy, let me be blunt about this:  this is a chick flick.  Leaving the preview showing of this film last night, the women I heard talking about it were gushing.  As I told my female friend I saw it with, I can easily imagine a scenario being constantly repeating itself over the holidays:  a couple arrives at the multiplex to see a movie.  He opts for ROCKY BALBOA, she for THE HOLIDAY.  The ensuing debate could be the end of many relationships.<br /><br />But guys, trust me on this one.  If you are in a relationship and want to make your woman happy, take her to see THE HOLIDAY.  This is going to go down as one of the best chick flicks of recent years.  And while it is obviously slanted to the ladies, I think most guys will like much of it as well.  It is not a perfect movie.  Though the reviewer below who made the absurd claim that the boom mike was constantly seen is flat out wrong, many of the scenes suffer from poor timing (usually the result of poor editing).  It is also astoundingly predictable.  If you know anything about the plot (i.e., if you have seen the preview) you know not only how it ends but most of the main plot developments.  But that is partly the point.  It is intended as a holiday feel good movie, and over the years it has been proven through tried and true methods precisely what makes folks feel good.  So, while the comic scenes don't scintillate like those from the great comic movies Eli Wallach's character in the film tells Kate Winslet's to see, they do add up to something satisfying in the end.<br /><br />The film revolves around two women in bad relationships--one in L.A. (Cameron Diaz) and one in Surrey, England (Kate Winslet)--wanting desperately to get away from their immediate surroundings to get some breathing room.  So they discover each other on a house exchange website, and Kate agrees to go to L.A. and Cameron to Surrey.  The houses, unlike the imagined boom mikes of the previous reviewer, do indeed feel like characters in the film, Winslet's almost impossibly picturesque cottage marvelously counterbalancing Diaz's ultra-stylish Hollywood estate.  Of course, both of them meet new men.  Cameron Diaz meets Winslet's brother, played by Jude Law, who instead of being sleazily charming as he so often is, is here merely charming.  And Kate Winslet meets not one but two men, one played by Jack Black, her eventual love interest.  The other man is Eli Wallach, who plays a veteran screenwriter from Hollywood's Golden Age.  I don't know if he is based on any one writer, but his output would compare with someone like Samson Raphaelson, the writer of many of Ernst Lubitsch's best scripts, including TROUBLE IN PARADISE, HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (he also wrote the short story that THE JAZZ SINGER was based on)  Also, Raphaelson was famously married to a former Ziegfield Follies performer to whom he was married for 66 years, and the character in this film was married for decades with someone who fit that bill.  I actually started thinking of Wallach as Raphaelson, partly because he recommended a list of classic comedies to Winslet, none of them the classics written by Raphaelson himself (she watches at least HIS GIRL FRIDAY, THE LADY EVE, and something with Irene Dunne, most probably THE AWFUL TRUTH).  But since Raphaelson retired to New York, the parallels are not precise.  I very much enjoyed the friendship that Winslet strikes up with the very old Wallach.  (I had such a gut feeling that the character Arthur Abbot was based on Raphaelson that I tried to see if writer/director Nancy Meyer had any connections to him, for instance as a student at Columbia, where Raphaelson taught the last few years of his life.  And without any proof to the contrary, I'll persist in that belief.)<br /><br />The film is merciless in its (largely successful) attempts to manipulate your heart.  One of the characters turns out to have two daughters who are cute beyond description.  One reason the filmgets away with so much is that the performers all are superb.  Winslet is just Winslet.  Diaz is far more likable here than in most of her more recent films.  Jack Black plays a more subdued version of himself.  And Jude Law is Jude Law.<br /><br />All in all, I think few will be disappointed in this film.  Yeah, maybe those guys who couldn't quite talk their dates into BORAT or ROCKY BALBOA may suffer enormously through the movie's more than two hours length, but I think virtually all women are going to adore it, and I think most men are going like it more than they suspect.

B000B8QEYC|4.0|My wife and I experienced the death of her mom early in 2006. She had had a series of strokes suddenly in late 2005, and after that, we simply lost her as a person although she remained alive. Mentally, she was gone. <br /> <br />During that time, we would collapse at home in the evenings to gather our resources to face the next day. On one of those evenings, the Enya song \\"If I could Be Where you are\\" began to play....\\"Where are you this moment...only in my dreams...you are missing...but you're always a heartbeat from me.\\"...well, we just lost it. The song made an intimate, visceral connection. <br /> <br />No songwriter/singer has touched us over the years as much as Enya. I remember reading that Titanic director James Cameron wanted Enya to sing for his blockbuster movie...he said her music touched him to the point of tears. <br /> <br />This is a beautiful album, yet much deeper than past ones and thus may escape the attention of some past fans. It is worth repeated listenings for the benefits that lie embedded, rather deeply, within.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This album reinforces the true genius of John, Paul, George and Ringo.  It also reinforces how much George Martin brought to the table and molded the original songs into classics, and what genius Giles Martin is in the studio as well. The fact that the tempos, chord patterns, and melodies can be layered and segued without the music being altered in a detectable way is almost mystical that it could be done and magical that it has been done. This whole album is like finding a new hidden story in the hyroglyphics inside one of the pyramids that we've been studying for hundreds of years.  <br /> <br />How does the same vocal track for the original \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" which rocks, transcend into a guitar and vocal intimate ballad as presented here without being re-recorded? \\"Mr. Kite\\" morphing into \\"She's So Heavy\\" is so great you have to laugh! <br /> <br />The 5.1 mix of this album could be the ultimate demonstration tool to wow anyone with your home theater setup.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I sit here trying to think of something to say but the title sums it up so well. <br />I was really excited to see this movie.

The beginnning is just awesome so once again, \\"score\\" right?...no no no thats where it all goes down hill there are literaly three action scenes in this movie, yes three, all of which have been sadly used time and time again. <br /> <br />I've never actually been this bored sitting through a movie. The movies isn't even about Superman it's much more about Lois and goofy looking child. Just when you think is movie is really going to take off they cut scene to the goofy kid and his dumb mother doing one more thing to get into trouble. <br /> <br />Never have I felt ripped off from a free movie coupon. <br /> <br />Just straight weak.
0425152251|3.0|The book Sophie's World by Jostien Gaarder is an extremely great read.  The book offers a brief course on the history of philosophy.  Along with the course, is an exciting mystery story that pulls you in and makes you want more.  I would definitely recommend this book for someone who wants to learn about philosophy, or even for someone who is even slightly interested by it.  But if you're not interested in the topics covered in it at all, or if they turn you off for whatever reason and you probably will not enjoy this book, because those topics are brought up a lot.  But if you are even slightly interested, or just think, \\"Hey, this sounds like it might be a cool book,\\" you will really enjoy reading it. <br /> The book starts out with a fourteen-year-old girl named Sophie walking home from school with her best friend Joanna.  They are discussing robots.  Joanna says that the human brain is a lot like a robot, but Sophie does not agree with her.  She feels like a person has to be more than just a piece of hardware.  When she gets home, she looks in the mailbox to discover a white envelope.  She opens it only to find one small slip of paper inside of it.  Written on the paper is, \\"Who Are You?\\"  This gets Sophie thinking.  She knew that she was Sophie Amundsen, but is she more than that?  Is she less than that?  After all, it's a really big world.  Soon afterwards she gets an another envelope in the mail with a piece of paper reading, \\"Where does the world come from?\\" written on it.  This starts a mad rush of thoughts to go through Sophie's head.  She starts to constantly think about the notes from the philosopher and what they mean.  Before long, she is on a correspondence course with the mysterious philosopher, learning more and more about the history of philosophy as the book goes on.  The story will keep you pulled into the book, and will make sure you don't get bored while you're reading it. <br /> One thing that I really enjoy about this book is that unlike mostmystery stories, where you don't know anything until the very end, you find out the answers to the various questions in the story slowly as the book goes on.  So if you're one of those people who likes to skip ahead to the very end of a mystery book to see what happens in the end, this book is not for you.  This aspect of the book keeps you compelled and alert, making sure to watch out for possible hints in the philosopher's letters and lessons about what some of the answers might be.  I find that this is a good aspect because it makes sure that you concentrate on what is going on. <br /> Sophie's World is an extremely interesting book.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is at all interesting in philosophy or for anyone who just wants to read a really great book.  It teaches a very important history and pulls you in at the same time.  If you get on a roll reading it, it gets hard to put down.  I'll end by saying that I read this book for a school project, in which I was only required to read the first half of the book, but it's so interesting I'm going to finish it.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|First of all, as a straight male, I was not at all interested in watching a love story about two men.  I happened to come across this movie on HBO one night and was immediately drawn in.  I really appreciated it as a work of art and social commentary.  It tells a great story without having to say a whole lot.  Perhaps this movie came out at just the right time - with the White House pushing for an ammendment to ban gay marriage and states putting the question of gay marriage up to a vote.  <br /> <br />Ang Lee directed what I would consider an accurate portrayal about the consequences of being forced into the closet.  Art imitates life like never before in this movie.  We've seen gay men with wives and children in politics outed (NJ Gov. McGreevey), and men in the entertainment industry caught living the lie.  What this movie does is show that being unaccepting of gays and forcing them into the closet is not only devistating for them, but for the women and children who unwittingly end up as victims to the closeting.  In my opinion, this is where the movie shines most.  Their relationships with their families are predictably horrible.  I tried to imagine myself in a reverse situation where I would be inclined to form a relationship with a man in order to live in a society unaccepting of who I really am.  Frankly, I wouldn't be able to do it.   <br /> <br />I agree with most reviewers in their praise of Brokeback Mountain.  The acting is very good.  The direction is outstanding.  I do have a few complaints though.  The sound is absolutely horrible.  Much of the dialogue could use subtitles.  The premise is a bit of a stretch too.  The love affair transcends decades despite no communication between them except for a few words on a post card to setup a trip together.  Long distance relationships are difficult when the two parties are in constant communication.  With the infrequency of their time together and hardly any communication in between, the two men would be morelike strangers than to one another than a couple.  I also found that Jack's parents were needlessly odd, but we only see them for five minutes.
B000B5Y00U|5.0|This is for me the best Traviata on records. True, it's not perfect. What is in this world? But nobody has matched the Violetta and Alfredo of this recording. Caball&eacute; is truly magnificent, her rich creamy sound following like no other soprano on records Verdi markings. She doesn't need \\"to be dramatic\\", she finds the drama in the music. And if you listen carefully you will see how many details are subtly illuminated by her performance. This is not one on your face interpretation. She doesn't scream her pain, she sings it. Her Alfredo is a perfect match, with unequalled phrasing and style. Their breath control is the stuff dreams, not to say legends, are made of. Do listen to Callas and Di Stefano of course, but give this recording a chance. If only Verdi could have heard it!
0938045695|5.0|Some people like to shake their fist from the sidelines and think they know it all because they read a lot. I am a personal trainer and have used kettlebells for a long time.  This works.  I have worked on everything from machines to Olympic weights, and find kettlebells more convenient and in some cases, the only product to do exercises you cannot do on machines or Olympic weights.  The first reviewer is calling this a fad, but look at the history, this has been around for longer than Body by Jake.  For some case history using my own personal history, I used the kettlebell exercise called the swing to help improve my endurance for running, just to try.  And guess what, I improved my time for a two mile run without running.  Also, the reviewer hints at swinging a kettlebell  can be dangerous, but so is benching, squatting, rowing, and any other exercise, IF YOU DO IT WRONG.  Plus I have found doing certain exercises, like the snatch and clean, are safer with a kettlebell than with a barbell.  <br />To answer the 'monetary' subject, how much money is your health worth to you.  I had a lot of clients refuse training saying it costs a lot of money, then they spends thousands of dollars for a quick fix.  In addition, the certification course for kettlebell training is the same for any personal trainer courses where we pay money to sponsors, NASM, ACE and others to keep informed in new classes and techniques to build our knowledge in health and fitness. Plus I bought three kettlebells totalling $300, but before I knew about KBs, I paid 100 for Olympic weights, 200 for a power rack, 50 for a good pair of adj dumbbells, 100 for an adj bench, and even more on numerous books and tapes on lifting correctly.  So don't call KBs expensive. <br />So before anyone takes the first reviewer into account, try it.  Using the kettlebell and Pavel's principles has helped my clients and myself.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Very informative, well organized and logical approach to the current and future environmental threats we will face as a civilization in the coming years.  Al Gore gives a phenomenal presentation and provides great insight.<br /><br />He applies the practical impacts it will have on us in every day life and on future generations.  He largely relies on proven data from the worlds leading scientists and dispells several myths in the process.<br /><br />The fifth star is for the positive and inspiration ending in which he outlines how easily we can alter our course if we all work together and become more energy efficient and environmentaly concious as a society.  I'd say it's a must see for anyone that cares about thier families future and has respect for life.
B000EPFVCS|5.0|Century Rain (2004) is a standalone SF novel.  Nanotechnology has invested the atmosphere of Earth, overcoming its programming, then burying the surface in ice and attacking unprotected organisms.  Only those few people in space survived the Furies.  The Slashers want to try to correct the condition with better nanites and recover the Earth, but the Threshers want to avoid making the situation worse.    The Slashers have discovered an abandoned alien portal that leads to a vast number of places within the galaxy and maybe beyond.  The Threshers are allowed access to the hyperweb only with Slasher escorts.  Naturally, the Threshers try to learn as much about the network as possible.    The Slashers are not monolithic, for the moderates are supporting the Thresher cause to some extent.  Slasher moderates and extremists are engaged in a shooting war within the Solar System.  Of course, a few Threshers are collateral casualties.    In this novel, Wendell Floyd and his partner Andre Custine are underemployed jazz musicians within Paris in 1959.  To supplement their income, they run a detective agency.  One day, Monsieur Blanchard hires them to investigate the fatal fall of a tenant, Susan White, from his apartment building.  Blanchard is convinced that it is murder, but the police magistrate has declared that it is suicide or misadventure.    Verity Auger is an archaeologist excavating Paris in 2266.  She works for the Antiquities Board of the United States of Near Earth, a maze of interconnected satellites around the planet.  Her latest dig has led to a tragedy and political opponents are trying to destroy her career.  However, she is contacted by the mythical Contingencies Board and briefed on Anomalous Large Structures.  Then she is sent to Mars.    On Phobos, she travels through a hyperweb tunnel to another Earth that is younger -- circa 1959 -- but strangely different -- the German attack on France was defeated before it reached Paris -- yet with problems of its own.  While the Contingencies Board believes the Slashers know nothing of the portal on Phobos, Auger finds evidence of genetically modified human weapons on Earth 2.    On E2, Auger pretends to be the sister of Susan White in order to retrieve a biscuit tin of documents.  The tin includes a letter to a German metalworking firm concerning a contract to produce three aluminum spheres and a map showing circles around Berlin, Paris and Milan, with distances noted in kilometers.  The tin also includes a postcard with two words underlined:  Silver and Rain.  There is also a ticket to Berlin for the day after her death.    This story has some of the aspects of time travel and crosstime stories, but is neither.  Earth 2 is apparently a \\"snapshot\\" of Earth taken around 1940 and then preserved in the ALS.  The Slasher extremists have not only infiltrated E2, but seem to be building some kind of measuring instrument there, probably to locate its position within the galaxy.    Highly recommended for Reynolds fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of private investigators, alien artifacts, and parallel cultures.    -Arthur W. Jordin
B000JLTRJ0|4.0|This movie tells the perspective through the police. Don't go expecting to see the towers get blown up or action sequences. This shows a remarkable true story about two police officers trapped in the rubble under the Twin Towers.<br /><br />It goes back and forth to their families with one expecting a child. This shows the police officers remarkable heroism, and courage and strength to stay alive. Just thinking back about it makes me cry again.<br /><br />If you're not into relationships and family, then this movie isn't for you. I am, however, very close to my family and this movie truly makes us appreciate our loved ones!

For me, this book COMPLETLY changed the way I thought about my family's financial future. It pushed me into action. This book will not show you what to do and how to do in detail- but, will change the way you look at your financial future in a big way. For a book to have an impact like that is actually stunning.     I say, read this book once a year, every year. Most importantly, get educated and take charge of your financial future.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|\\"Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut\\" is proof that movie buffs can make a difference. Thanks to continual pressure from fans to have Donner's version of the first sequel to \\"Superman: The Movie\\" released, Warner Bros. and the Salkinds caved in, and allowed Donner to finish what he started almost three decades ago!<br /><br />So, how does this version of \\"Superman II\\" stand up to the Richard Lester cut? It's a better version of the film. It's not a LOT better than Lester's cut, but still superior. For starters, it's not got the campy humor. There are some funny moments in the Donner's version, to be sure, but nothing so rediculous like in Lester's version.<br /><br />The scenes added back in give added dimension to the film. Seeing Marlon Brando return as Jor-El makes for great emotional intensity between father and son. Seeing Brando and Reeve actually interact in one segment is a fan's fantasty come true in a way. And the ending also gels a lot better as well.<br /><br />Once again, we see Christopher Reeve prove that he is still the definitive Superman. The new scenes help to give the character even better emotional complexity than in the Lester version. The rest of the performances, as had been the case in the first film, are stellar, from Gene Hackman's humorous Lex Luthor, to Margot Kidder's witty Lois Lane. And finally, we get to see Brando give another supreme performance as Jor-El. His added scenes alone make this version worth owning.<br /><br />If there's any weakness in this version of the film, it's in the editing. Choosing not to show most of what Lester had shot, there are some moments where the film can seem a bit jumpy. If they had used a little more footage from the Lester film, then this problem might have been avoided. However, it is but a small problem with an otherwise fantastic film.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are a bit light, but still worthwhile. Richard Donner gives the fans his thanks in an interesting introduction to the film, while a unique featurette shows how Donner's vision for \\"Superman II\\" was restored. There's a unique commentary track, and some fascinating deleted scenes as well.<br /><br />To me, I would consider this film not a \\"replacement\\" for the Richard Lester version, but as an alternate version of the best of the \\"Superman\\" sequels. I definitely recommend owning it, even if you have the original version as well! I believe that you'll enjoy it!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: As how Donner's vision for \\"Superman II\\" was restored.

B000IAZPKM|5.0|If you like great rock music, camera work, picture/sound quality and the voice of Roy Khan in top form, you've come to the right place. What's not to love? Plus the second disc is loaded with features that really give you insight into the band and the making of the DVD itself. This is a must buy for any Kamelot fan, especially for those like me, who have never seen them live.
B000I0QK74|4.0|Times change. People change. I was never a big James Taylor fan but I do like this Christmas album. He's been around long enough and he is part of our cultural being. Good enough for me. The Sinatra's of my time are just about all gone. The young guys are now becoming part of the old guard. They say this album was released a couple of years ago under a different name with a couple less songs. Well that really doesn't matter. It makes me feel good inside and isn't that what's really important? It makes me feel good.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|This was originally meant to be a mixtape and it has that feel to it. There's no \\"radio\\" type song. It's just straight hip-hop and getting to the roots of the reasons why these guys are in the rap game, lyricism and the hunger to be on a mic. <br /> <br />-The intro has an amazing beat in the background, gets you very hyped for the album and leads very well into the song We're Back. We're back is alright, decent verse from Em and an average beat. Ca$his shines on this. <br /> <br />-Pistol Pistol Remix by O Trice is better than expected. <br />-Murder is one of my fav. tracks on the album, good verse from Bizarre. <br />-The Re-Up is creative, haven't heard anything like this really.  <br />-You Don't Know, obviously one of the best on the album. <br />-Jimmy Crack Corn has a solid beat, the chorus is catchy and Em's 2nd verse is better than his first. 50 comes strong. <br />-Trapped is outstanding. it's the first verse from the older song \\"We Aint Scared\\" but Em adds some extra production to the song. excellent. <br />-Whatever You Want I found to be very mediocre, especially comin from Swift and Denaun which are both two of the better members in d12 <br />-By My Side by Stat is on target. his flow is tight and the girl voice works very well with the song. good production <br /> <br />The songs here in between there are neither stand out songs or songs that suck, they are all good tracks.  <br /> <br />The album ends with the song No Apologies by Eminem. The beat is driven by a haunting piano loop and em spits straight fire the whole time reminiscent of The Marshall Mathers LP days. somber track but best on the album and his best song since Like Toy Soldiers. <br /> <br />Overall it was a solid album showcasing all members of the Shady Records family. This wasn't a classic album but it got back to the basic sof hip-hop and how it's supposed to be, not this trash that's on the radio nowadays. Listen to this album.
B000J10ERO|4.0|I watched this movie wondering how bad it would be, and I think this movie is as good or better than the Christopher Reeve Superman.  I think Brandon Routh did an AWESOME job of paying \\"homage\\" to Chris - he could have BEEN him! If you liked the original, then you will like this one. <br /> <br />
0393061434|5.0|I don't read all that much, and when I do I want an easy to read, but yet still fun book. <br /> <br />iWoz is great in that aspect, you take Woz's joyfully manner of speaking, and it's in book form.  When you read it, it sounds like he's talking right to you.  He talks about amazing things, and he comes across just as he is, honest and wanting to do more with technology because he loves it. <br /> <br />It's a great read in that it's an insight into one of the greatest minds of our time, and what a true engineer should be.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|FACT: over 75% of total greenhouse gases is CO2! That's right, the gas we breathe out. It is also released by burning trees, and so our rainforest-burning friends in South America are to blame for 99% of global warming etc. Most of the remaining gases are also natural.  Also, the world is coming out of a small ice age.  Therefore, North Americans are not responsible.  Well, maybe we're responsible for like 1% of the harmful gases. 1 friggin percent for a whole century of driving millions of automobiles. 1 friggin percent.  WATCH SOMETHING ELSE
0671015206|5.0|I love this book because it grounds you.  It shows you that the people who actually have wealth, are not the ones out there who we think they are.  For this and this alone the book should be purchased.   <br /> <br />There is also good information in the book to even measure your own wealth, and what type of person you are, and how to change it.  I thought it would be more self help garbage, but it actually taught me a lot, showed me that people around me may actually have money and be very smart planners, but don't have to have a lot of flash in their lives.
B00005JPDJ|1.0|The list of characters for THE HOLIDAY needs to include the boom mic! Sometimes it appears as a round hanging shadow lurking above the other characters, but other times you can actually see the wires and pole thrusting it into the scene. It had perfect timing to intrude on the last great moment of the film when Jude Law cries for his woman. Hopefully the mic will receive some critical acclaim and win some awards. A+ for Mr. Boom Mic. <br /> <br />The whole film crew should go back to film school! Obviously they thought the story would hide the technical faults. Wrong! <br />
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|I read the reviews about people saying their watch scratched and lost paint on it.  Mine has not done this with the exception of the clasp.  Since the watch and band are titanium it should be anondized, meaning it's not going to come off.  However the clasp and a few other small parts (watch hands) are made of stainless steel, so they will start losing their finish after awhile. <br /> <br />After wearing this watch for a few weeks, I went and put on my old stainless steel Citizen watch.  It felt huge and felt like it weighed a ton.  I went and weighed each of them.  The Citizen came in around 4.5oz, while the Skagen came in at around 1.5oz.  It is also very thin, I used to not be able to wear a watch since typing on a computer all day the band would irritate me, have not had any problems with the Skagen. <br /> <br />One other thing to note, the picture for this item shows the Steel watch (you can see it on the face), if you want to see a picture of the titanium one, take the product number and go to skagen's site, or google. <br /> <br />The skagen lost a star because of the paint coming off the clasp (not the band).
B00006LJ6X|5.0|Simply put, this was the album that made me into a jazz trombone player. Chicago VII was the last moment in time when this prolific band got together in Colorado and decided to really stretch and redefine its music.  Chicago VII defies categorization because it is jazzy, samba, rock and pop all at once.  And nobody should feel the need to make apologies for the pop tracks on this great double album...that was part of the landscape in those days, especially when the band was trying to show their range and musicianship.  The double album would have been worth the purchase price just for \\"Byblos\\" alone.  What a great song by Terry Kath that still haunts me to this day.  I still think that Byblos is the most under rated Chicago song of all time, and I've often wondered why it wasn't released as a single as well?  Can you imagine what an impact this song would have had during the mid-70s on the music scene had it been heard by a larger audience?   <br /> <br />Chicago was never same after Kath's death later in the decade, but in reality, it was never the same after Chicago VII.  This album is just as vibrant today as it was on its original release date.  The band has become unfairly become known as a sappy ballad band, but those who really know Chicago's work know that \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\", \\"Chicago II\\" and \\"Chicago VII\\" leave a legacy of greatness for this group that can't be washed away by later disasters.  This is a must have CD.
B000I5X81A|5.0|What few people seem to fail to recognize is how great of a singer/songwriter J.J. Cale is. The fact that most people know him as the guy who wrote Eric Claptons Cocaine and After Midnight goes to show that a lot of people have never really dug into the vast catalouge of songs that J.J. has recorded himself. I like J.J. Cale better then I like Eric Clapton, so lets begin here...<br />This is a J.J. Cale album more than it is an Eric Clapton album. Cale wrote eleven of the fourteen tracks, and even though Clapton plays a pretty solid guitar, and sings harmony alongside, its basically JJ's show. Which is cool if you ask me. Clapton is no doubt, an admirer of JJ Cale. If you listen to his 1978 recording of Cocaine, and then listen to the Cale original, you may notice that they sound almost exactly the same. The only major difference between the two was the artist name on the front of the record. Claptons version became a huge hit. The mellow sounds of the songs on this record flow very nicely, and its good to think that perhaps this artist is going to get a little more recognition than usual, now that E.C has stamped his name on the bill.<br />Thing is, this is a long overdue collaboration, and listening to it, it is obvious why. Everyone mentions how this is Claptons best album in years, and it is true. But for JJ Cale, it is about the same quality as all of his other records... for instance his album To Tulsa and Back, which came out about two years ago, was equally as good. JJ Cale writes songs that are smooth and easy, but not soft. I dig. Read some other reviews and they will all say this album is good, because it is. I also don't want to sound like I'm trying to discredit Clapton for what he brings to the album. I just wanted to say that if you dig this one, you should maybe check out a few more JJ Cale albums, before you go looking for something similar from Eric Clapton.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This movie has something few movies have, that is I have found I can watch it several times in a week and not get bored of it. It's re-watch factor is very high, particularly if you really enjoy the Next Generation. While I would have appreciated a bit more space battles between the ships themselves, what space battling offered is extremely well done. <br /> <br />But the main focus of the film's storyline is the stark contrast of the nightmare happening on the enterprise, it's getting assimilated! with the outlandish earthly antics of reluctant visionary/lunatic Zefram Cochrane (oobie doobie) and the team of Geordi, Riker, and Troi trying to persuade him to make his historic flight, completely oblivious to what is going on up in space. <br /> <br />The borg themselves have never been creepier, and they really come off as unstoppable. The interaction between the borg queen and Data makes a great story, as is the pairing of Picard and Lily. I think the Picard/Lily arguing at the movie's end is a bit contrived but hey, it's just a movie. <br /> <br />Music is great, special effects are excellent, and enough interesting things in each scene to keep you coming back for more. I could not ask for more in a Star Trek film.
B000I5X824|5.0|When I saw that Staind was releasing a compilation CD of their big hits throughout the past decade, I knew I had to have it. I love this CD. I'm a little disappointed that \\"Home\\" and \\"Fade\\" were left off the CD, though. Still, Aaron Lewis live...you can't get much better than that. A great buy for any Staind fan.
B000I0QK74|1.0|The stultifying bore applies his well-crafted soul-less hackery to the Christmas canon. Just go and click on that 30-second Jingles Bell clip above and see if you can make it to the end. Fans, however, will love this record.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Covering the career of a legend is never an easy task, but this film more than delivers. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver believable and incredible performances as Johnny and June Carter Cash and completely fooled this reviewer, who was astonished to find that their vocals weren't dubbed.<br /><br />It's a bit disappointing that more of Cash's early life isn't covered, especially his turbulent relationship with his father, but this is, after all more about his romance with June, which survived his battles with drinking and drugs and the turmoil of being a celebrity. Honest and forthright, this is a heartwarming tribute to one of the most enduring love affairs in country music history. Can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a pity that Johnny and June didn't live to see it, but they've earned immortality through their music. Five stars
B000063DIR|4.0|Review number 91. Ozzy's full-hearted follow-up to his (no doubt) notorious 'Blizzard Of Ozz' (see my review) lp. Have heard from various sources that when Sony had recently - again reissued this disc that they notably did an overall sound 're-make' - re-edited or something. What's going on with that? I, personally couldn't say for sure because it's been so long since I've listened to the original album. Tracks here - that I would just love to hear the great Oz perform again while out on tour sometime are \\"Over The Mountain\\", the ass-kicking \\"Flying High\\", the low-key \\"Believer\\", maybe \\"Little Dolls\\" and the rocking title cut \\"Diary Of A Madman\\". I was one of the fortunate concert goers that actually got to catch Randy Rhoads play twice (second time was on this very tour) just prior to his untimely demise. Either way, this title is a true '80's metal classic. Would make a nice stocking stuffer.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool's AEnima will be the album by which all other great hard rock albums will be judged. Not for everyone and not meant to be, AEnima's songs are long, complex, and relentlessly heavy in sound and content. Once you do connect with this album, it may ruin you for other heavy metal or hard rock albums, including other Tool records.  <br /> <br />My wife had a three word review of the AEnima album: \\"dreary psycho music.\\" I call it the Dark Side of the Moon of heavy metal. It's probably a combination of the two, which may be the secret to its brilliance.
B000HBKCDC|2.0|I have to say I am very disappointed.  I have never purchased a Sarah McLachlan CD before but what sold me is the absolutely beautiful arrangement/performance of O Little Town of Bethlehem that you hear by clicking on the video performance just below the picture of the CD cover (not in the track samples).  Well, much to my surprise and dismay this is NOT the arrangement that is actually on the CD.  The arranagement on the CD has some strings which have a strange dynamic phrasing (kind of like the sound is being squeezed on and off rather abruptly) which doesn't seem to meld very well with the guitar (which seems to have a somewhat dead, non-resonant sound or almost like a banjo) and some other weird instrument/synthesizer like sound that appears now and then and sounds to me like a squished cat whining out a melody). <br /> <br />The Greensleves is unusual but could've been much better (and not so monotonous) if had intermixed the traditional melody with the variation she has developed.  I disliked the First Noel/Mary Mary immensely.  Especially the middle interlude that goes off on some sort of Loreena McKennitt wanna be noisy exploration that sounded Islamic to my husband and prompted him to call from another room to please turn that horrible thing off.  Some of the other tunes are OK, but not fabulous in my opinion.   <br /> <br />I am truly disappointed, especially with the promise offered by the video clip advertising it here. <br /> <br />If anyone knows where I can get that rendition downloaded, that would be worthwhile.
0345441184|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon retells the matter of Britain from several feminine perspectives such as Igraine, Gwenhwyfar, and Viviane - but above all, Morgaine who is called le Fay, dedicated to the Goddess at a young age and heiress to all that is Her worship. The novel is often interpreted as Christianity versus paganism, which is an aspect of the story but not all of it. What Bradley explores is how Christianity and paganism exist side by side, how the Mists of Avalon are still there if only one can push them to one side to enter into the mystery beyond. <br /> <br />Bradley's elegantly evocative writing style, the glimpse of how it might have truly been create both a tantalizing and a soothing universe for the reader seeking to lose themselves to the fantasy. Bradley also does an excellent job creating a consistent world wherein mystery, love, tradition and religion intertwine the fates of so many. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I am a lifelong musician and especially love Celtic music. It has such a magic to it, and I love the stories they tell. These lovely ladies were phenomenal singers. Beautiful spirits with totally classy presentation. I believe just about everyone knows a lot of these old classics no matter how young or old you are. The energy level was phenomenal! Although I'm a happily married man, I did fall in love with the gorgeous violinist! What a performer. As she played (incredibly well) she danced and flirted with the audience and I might add some of the guys watching really got into it!  All in all, an incredible experience. I'm buying the DVD as soon as I can. Do yourself a big favor and buy it! p.s. the band was the highest excellent standard of musicianship and very lively too!
0714845183|5.0|Peter Trippi's monograph has done what I would assume had to be very difficult to do: he has a good feel for the quiet,quiet man behind the paintings. The depth of his study helped me to verify a number of pieces of information that led me into my own research, and has continued to be my main reference as I continue my work. I recommend that this is the book to begin with if you are going to enter any serious study of John William Waterhouse; however, don't let that make you think it is only a scholar's read: it is well written, beautifully illustrated, and simply a joy to behold.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This was one of the best Walt Disney's Movies ever made, the forteenth animated feature, in chronological line order, for this Film Company.    The tale on this Platinum DVD about \\"Peter Pan,\\" is a magical story of a boy in search of his missing silhouette, that while looking for his shadow visiting London, meets the children of the Darling Family and brings all of them back with him to Never Land, where this fable finally unfolds splendidly.    \\"Peter Pan,\\" a parable about a boy who never desires to grow up, it is once again been colorfully presented here for the third time, maybe even for one last time, on DVD by Walt Disney. It is of course a delightfully written script, that over all keeps marvelouslly well with the pace of the original fable by James M. Barrie's book story. And regardless of what purist text reviewers may like to point out, it's nevertheless my humble impression that as offered here, as an adaptation written by Disney for a \\"CARTOON MOVIE TALE,\\" does seen to work wonderfully fine for this theatrical reincarnation of it's original \\"Peter Pan\\" book's legend.    Like for instances, it still retains and shows the desire of all young kids for longebity, taking fantasy journeys & wishing to never grow up. Add to this mix the \\"Prixie Fairy Tinkerbell,\\" then include a mischievously naughty 'Captain Hook,' along with a quantity of 'Pirates,' some bunch of crazy warier 'Indians,' as well as finally 'The Magic Ability to Fly,' and you got here on film a sophisticated, yet complicated story produced by Walt Disney, that childrens of all ages and backgrounds would enjoy forever, for it speaks to \\"THEIR IMAGINATION FROM THEIR HEART.\\"    \\"Peter Pan\\" was theatrically released for the silver screen, for the first time in 1953, I saw it very young with my parents, plus little sister, at one of my home town two movie theaters, and felt instantly in love with \\"Peter Pan's Story.\\" Disney have released this film twice before on DVD, but only was first originaly fully \\"Restored and Remastered\\" for 'Picture & Sound Above and Behond the Film Original Brilliance' for their second  release, the right now very hard to get one disk DVD ~ \\"PETER PAN SPECIAL EDITION.\\" ~ Therefore, am sure that this new to be re-issued, \\"PETER PAN\\" once again fully \\"Remastered\\" in a two disk 'PLATINUM EDITION,' would become one of the best buys next spring for all of those Disney \\"PLATINUM SPECIAL EDITION COLLECTORS.\\"    I would certainly buy it next March 2007, even whem am still (ONE OF THE FEW LUCKY OWNERS OF THE OTHER \\"PETER PAN SPECIAL EDITION,\\") which did also happened to come with some insteresting documentaries and extra features, ~ DVD which still do love watching every second and every time I play it.     Imagine then, all the supplementary extras that this new platinum edition would have in order to exceed the previous DVD features. Beside once again been \\"Fully Remastered & Restored for Picture & Sound,\\" just to simply beat that now out of print \\"Peter Pan Special Edition.\\" For sure it most be a fantastic third time around \\"PLATINUM.\\"      Because \\"PETER PAN\\" is a wonderfull story about 'Growing Up,' then I would like to recomend that all families consider buying, once it does again become available at retail stores next March 2007, in order to show their childrens. Since \\"Peter Pan\\" is every 'Boys Dream' and every little 'Girls Fantasy, all at once come true, in their still sweet inocent and tender imaginations. Also since we all know well that in our souls we still do remain forever 'Childrens at Heart,' would be fun for us to watch and own it too as grown up adults.    We have waited a long time for Walt Disney to re-release \\"PETER PAN,\\" and beside all this waiting, there are out there new generations of kids everywhere living, who have never seen this fable on DVD; whom still may be eagerly awaiting to see the delight of discovering, and learning like we once did from the lessons teaches by this \\"PETER PAN STORY.\\"    Now like to end thisreview, intended to share with all my previous experiences about the others DVD's releases of this Motion Picture, as well as to contribute with some of my childhood/adult feelings about \\"Disney's Peter Pan Story,\\" by now honorably \\"THANKING THE STUDIO,\\" which gave us in Films: \\"ALL OUR CHILDHOOD DREAMS/FANTASIES IN TECHNICOLOR.\\"    MY BEST WISHES TO YOU ALL FOR A PEACEFULL HOLIDAY SEASON AND A HAPPY NEW 2007, FOREVER AND EVERMORE IN HEAVEN & EARTH.

B0000025YL|3.0|With Restless And Wild Accept finally found the trademark sound that made them a household name in the 80s! Although many would say that they sounded a little too much like Ac/Dc, I and many others would strongly disagree with that. The vocal stylings of Udo are unmistakable and the guitar playing of Wolf is far more technical then that of Angus (over in the Ac/Dc camp). I am a huge fan of both bands but I don't think they are that similar. On Restless And Wild,Accept are far more aggressive then anything on their past albums. In fact,it almost seems too much,all pedal to the metal,so to speak. It is almost undeniable that \\"Fast As A Shark\\" is one of the all time greatest songs to open a concert with,and the title cut \\"Restless And Wild\\" will no doubt have you singing along,but even with that going in it's favor,I still can't give it above a 3 star review. Accept is one of my favorite bands and I give them complete credit for standing by the style of music they love and never selling out to follow the current musical trend of the month,I'd love to give them higher than a 3,but the songwriting on \\"Restless And Wild\\" in my opinion isn't up to the previous outing \\"Breaker\\" or the one to follow,the ultimate Accept \\"Balls To The Walls\\". It just feels almost too aggressive.<br /><br />That being said,if you are new to the band,let me recommend \\"Breaker\\",\\"Balls To The Wall\\" or \\"Metal Heart\\",after those,this is a great place to go. The monster style is all here. Accept truly ROCKS!!!<br /><br />The Pros:Absolutely one of the best guitar sounds I've ever heard on CD.Even the follow-up \\"Balls To The Wall\\" doesn't have quite the awesome guitar crunch this one has. It also has some killer tunes,\\"Fast As A Shark\\" has a fantastic guitar solo,the title cut \\"Restless And Wild\\" is very catchy,but my favorite tune on this album is \\"Princess Of The Night\\" which has some very cool dynamics. As always,Udo is in top form. The combination of Udo on lead vocals and Wolf on lead guitar is really tough to beat. They both did an outstanding job on this,as did the rest of the band!<br /><br />The Cons:In my opinion,it's a little too fast paced the whole way through the album.If you love aggressive music and nothing but,this is the album for you,but I like the melodic side that the band shows more on other releases better.Also,a lot of the songwriting was not very memorable on this album as opposed to the previous or the follow-up.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:Great sounding metal album,all producers of rock should listen to these guitar tones and take notes. A great CD to listen to when you are feeling aggressive.One of their 5 best but not the best place to start. If you're a fan,you should definitely buy this. Donutman says so!!!ly tough to beat.

B0000025YW|4.0|Balls To The Wall is not only one of the greatest Accept albums of all times,it is truly one of the greatest metal albums of all time! In fact,along with \\"Holy Diver\\" from Dio,\\"Pyromania\\" from Def Leppard and \\"Headhunter\\" from Krokus,this is what I would play for someone who has never heard 80s style metal. It's really that good. Accept is one of my favorite bands and this CD has all the reasons for that. Udo has never sounded better with his trademark screaming vocals (no one sounds quite like him,no one,and that's the sign of a legend),Wolf is in top form as usual for great lead guitar work and the rest of the band is just awesome. As great as this is,it is not my favorite Accept album,that honor goes to the one that followed this \\"Metal Heart\\" but in all fairness I'm a sucker for melody and that was their most melodic album. However,when it comes to THE classic Accept sound,you simply can't beat this. It has the radio smash hit \\"Balls To The Walls\\" the amazing \\"London Leather Boys\\", and so much more. Every song on here is a classic and how many CDs can you truly say that about? This CD was my first taste of Accept. I was at a concert in 1983 (it was a Kix concert being from Pennsylvania where they played alot) and my favorite memory of that night was not the concert itself (which was great too) it was the CD they played before the concert. I heard this fantastic song called Head Over Heels,then I heard \\"Turn Me On\\" then I heard \\"Love Child\\" and then I heard \\"Balls To The Walls\\" and at that point I said \\"I have got to buy this CD\\" the next day I went to the record store and bought it and listened to it so much I wore out my cassette (thank goodness for CDs).

I am happy to see that this story and the fantastic illustrations that accompany it have withstood the test of time.  This is a book that also holds up well to being read over and over even a child gets older.  In my opinion, you can't miss with this one!

0062502182|5.0|This book came to me at a time in my life when I needed it the most.  I've read a million inspiring books, but this one was different. I've always felt in awe of people who spoke of their spiritual journey's, I just didn't get it. After reading this story, I felt as if something very subtle had changed unexpectedly in the one afternoon it took me to read the book. <br /> <br />Anyone who does not \\"get it\\"  or thought the book is overrated isn't ready to hear the message. It will either strike you to the core or it won't.  I do think at some point in every persons life, they will be ready for the message this book gives.  If nothing else, if it changes your outlook on your life for one day, it will be the best day you've had in a long time. Good luck.
0618680004|3.0|The God Delusion is a great book for summarizing the scientific worldview on questions that many consider the realm of religion.  He presents the strong case against the existence of a supernatural intelligence as the creator or our world, addresses creationist objections, shows the weakness of theological arguments, and does a great job of summarizing the naturalist explanations for human moral systems, consciousness, and even the existence of religion itself.<br /><br />But Dawkins seems to completely miss a large part of the point of religion.  He talks about `non-overlapping magisteria', the separate worlds of science and religion, and tries to dismiss it.  He is correct that when religion makes claims about how the world works, the origins of humans, etc. that these claims fall into the realm of scientific inquiry.  His discussion of ethics, however, is glib and unsophisticated.  Religion really is about ethics at it's core - that is, it revolves around questions of how to act in life - and science and reason are limited in what they have to offer in this realm of thought.<br /><br />Dawkins characterizes religion as a `memeplex', and notes that the extreme credulity of children makes it easy to pass on.  Curiously though he doesn't consider the possibility that there can be very positive and useful teachings bound up in these memeplexes.  He makes the usual arguments for religion as a source of evil, and asserts that scaring children with hell amounts to child abuse.  But he's quick to brush off and possibility that religion, or religious traditions, might have any good to offer, when he even considers it.<br /><br />I don't understand how he could fail to see, under his own paradigm, that a `memeplex' of some sort that tells us how to live our lives is an inevitable part of human societies.  Ethical values like delayed gratification, charity, honesty, hard work, compassion may indeed have biological roots, but they are also acquired from and cultivated by thesociety in which we live, and part of these societies are religion.  We are going to have an moral `memeplex', so we might as well have one that leads to a good society, and happy, productive lives.  Dawkins seems to think that the `memeplex' offered by religion is a bad one, and he holds up religious extremists to make his case.  But, what does Dawkins suggest in the place of religion?<br /><br />He seems to think that our natural moral sense, along with reason,  are adequate, and that we don't really need religion - nor by extension the institutions for promoting ethical values.  This argument rings hollow though.  I think even Dawkins would have to agree that some memeplexes are better than others.  He is arguing _against_ one after all.<br /><br />He points out that he can google up a `New Ten Commandments' that offer a pretty good ethical code, and even offers his own additions.  Commandments though do not a religious system make.  Continual self-examination and contemplation of these moral ideals are needed if the they are to be instilled into ones behavior in any meaningful way.  That is what the root of the Judeo-Christian tradition is - at least as far as I, an atheist, understand it.  If religions institutions, and their texts, are a means for superior memeplexes to thrive, then how can Dawkins argue against them?<br /><br />Read chapters 1 through 6.  They really are well written, and give a great overview of the naturalist worldview on matters that have in past times been in the realm of religion.  The last four chapters of it though can be skipped, I feel, and largely just serve to make him look like an angry atheist.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|Neil Burger is a very talented filmmaker, but what you have with THE ILLUSIONIST is all of the trappings of a major motion picture and none of the substance. Part of the problem is that in an age where a whole generation of moviegoers has become used to the techniques of digital effects in movies, the ones employed in this movie simply don't bowl you over because they've been used so many times recently. And it makes it that much more difficult to suspend disbelief and imagine the 19th century audience watching Eisenheim's magic act gasping and being astounded at what they see. The other flaw, though, is that the plot (which I won't give away) has enough holes to drive a truck through, holes that attempt to be dressed up by beautiful if vapid cinematography and editing that would do most television commercials proud. That may seem unfair, but this whole movie works at the level of a television commercial, serving up the implausible in a handsome package that wraps everything up neatly at the end....NOT.<br /><br />Sorry, but this is an empty film, and everyone associated with it are capable of much better.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Gerard Butler gives a stunning performance as the moody reclusive Phantom of the Opera. His obsession with Christine (Emmy Rossum) awakens our own sense of impossibility as we watch Christine struggle with all that she can and can't control. Her fascination with the Phantom seems born of her love for her father, who she assumes has returned from the grave as an Angel of Music to guide her career.<br /><br />The sets and gold, sapphire and crimson costumes are especially magical, with cavernous labyrinths, an extremely ornate opera house in Paris and mysterious mirrors leading to worlds luminous with hundreds of candles where boats glide along underground rivers.<br /><br />If you loved Jean Cocteau's Orphic Trilogy and his movie: Beauty and The Beast, this has many revelations. This really does come across as an Operatic Beauty and the Beast with the Phantom's disfigured face more a situation of reality than a magical curse. This makes the story even more appealing because if Christine really does love him for who he is, she will not be finding out he is really a rich prince. Raoul seems so much less interesting and his character is not fully explored to any degree. We have no idea why Christine would be romantically interested except that he seems to have known her when she was a child and they have shared memories.<br /><br />While Gerard Butler is the dark sexy strength in the movie, Emmy Rossum presents the beautiful luminous innocence as she struggles with her emotions and comes to terms with what she truly wants out of life. Every time Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum appear together in this movie I was completely fascinated by the story and Emmy looked even more beautiful in the presence of Gerard Butler. The chemistry is stunning and when they sing together is makes the movie completely spellbinding and emotionally exquisite.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000ION79Y|1.0|I don't know why Seagal even bothered to show up for this one. Like the Exorcist, his voice changes at least 2 times with horrible dubs. He's fat with some kind of rat's nest growing out of the back of his head.  <br /> <br />This is Seagal at his embarrasing worst. The last 5 or 6 jokes he's produced were like bad car wrecks. I didn't want to look but I had to. Thinking maybe each one would be better than the last; they couldn't get much worse. Of course this never happened. <br /> <br />Attack Force is the final straw. I will never rent his schlock again. He's a washed up has-been that can't even muster enough energy to use his own voice.  <br /> <br />Shame on you, Seagal. You stink!
0307346609|5.0|totally gripping. couldn't put it down. the movie version should be like Fog of War or The Civil War; a straight documentary, lots of talking head interviews. i think this book is even scarier because it's told in such a dispassionate after-the-fact style. highly recommended!
B00005JPCA|5.0|This new twist in the ongoing saga of James Bond is sure to please and entertain devoted Bond fans. After a long hiatus by the action spy figure, British actor Daniel Craig is chosen to resurrect the Ian Fleming character and Craig does it with a vengeance.    What makes this film unusual is that it opens at a time in the life of our favorite secret agent before he earns his \\"00\\" status. (I guess that makes him just plain old \\"7,\\" not to be confused with \\"7 of 9.\\") He earns the coveted status before our very eyes by completing his second kill and a hesitant \\"M\\" (played by Judi Dench) promotes him.     There's no honeymoon for our hero because his lack of experience as a \\"00\\" agent is evident as several important assignments go awry and bring a great deal of unwanted attention to MI6. Sparks fly between M and Bond when M expresses reservations about his progress as a \\"00\\" and Bond seems unsure of himself as he stumbles over his own two feet while honeing his lethal skills.    With no time to feel sorry for himself Bond must quickly discover and foil a terrorist plot by Alex Dimitrios (played Simon Abkarian) and his beautiful but deadly wife Solange (played by Caterina Murino) to blow up a passenger airliner. Bond's investigation leads him to the Bahamas where he finds himself in a high stakes poker game attended by Dimitrios that requires a $10 million entrance fee. MI6 bankrolls Bond's seat but sends the lovely Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) to safeguard the cash. Unfortunately, the faltering Bond manages to lose the entire stake in the card game.    Another unexpected plot twister is that Bond falls madly in love with his partner, Vesper Lynd, and even resigns from MI6 to spend the rest of his life with her. I thought Bond's only true love interest was his wife Patricia; who was introduced to the storyline in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" and subsequently killed at the end of the movie. It seems Patricia was the second time cupid nailed our Casanova of cloakand dagger and Vesper was the first. Needless to say, the romance doesn't last. (You'll have to watch the movie to find out why.)    This rip roaring spy thriller is laced with plenty of intense action, sex appeal, and drama to keep your heart pounding throughout the film. The movie depicts the humble beginnings of the world's most celebrated spy before he evolved into the suave debonair secret agent that exploded onto the silver screen over 40 years ago.    James Bond is bigger than ever and brings a whole new assortment of gadgets to thrill and excite the audience. Yes, Bond is back - and not a moment too soon.
B00005JPCA|5.0|This isn't just a great Bond movie, it's a great action movie. Period. Of course, great action movies need great leads, and Daniel Craig is just that. Despite playing a really, really tough guy, his performance is nuanced, even subtle at times. This Bond is a real guy, folks. A tough as nails, adrenaline charged tough guy of the sort we've probably met in lesser incarnations. If he needs to kill you, he will, and he's pretty good about rationalizing the whole business. Hey, it's a tough world, after all, and he's willing get his [...] ruptured to protect good people from bad guys that would like nothing more than to kill each and everyone one of us. We need this James Bond.<br /><br />Okay, the plot, at times, seems a bit Byzantine, but that's a good chunk of the pleasure. In addition, the story, the motivations, and the relationships are spot on, and the underlying premise plays out as completely convincing. The film is all about finding a way to make a mastermind terror financier talk. How better to do that than arrange for a way to put him on the short list of the devils he finances. That his own weaknesses are part of the set-up is all the more satisfying.<br /><br />Oh, and you want a bond girl? One that can actually act? One that isn't a cookie-cutter? One that you actually start caring about?  That's here, too.<br />Eva Green is stunningly beautiful because of who she is, not how she looks in a low cut cocktail dress. Nice dress, though.<br /><br />I'd always suspected that Pierce Brosnan was behind those web sites that tried to derail this movie and Daniel Craig's turn as Bond. He had good reason to be worried.<br /><br />Pierce who?
B000LC4CVA|5.0|When I DVR'd this show on PBS, I expected the usual PBS musical fare, heavy on education, short on entertainment.  Whoa!  Big surprise!  These 5 women are nothing short of captivating, and the supporting cast, especially the two percussionists, obviously got carried away by the magic of the concert.  I don't speak a word of Gaelic, and the songs these ladies sang in Gaelic simply knocked my socks off, especially Maev's version of Dulaman (hope I spelled it right).  The concert was held at night in front of an ancient Irish castle, and for the lucky concertgoers, there was truly old Celtic magic in the air that night.  See this if you can, it's an awesome experience.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This CD and the music it provides reminds me of what loneliness is. It's beautiful & heartbreaking. And so it is...
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is an awesome cd. i have an appreciation for cool \\"mash ups\\" and there's a lot of people dissing this album because it is essentially a remix project using the beatles' original recordings. keep in mind that half the beatles are dead therefore it's not likely they'll be a new album soon. any albums of outtakes or unique concepts like this are a welcome addition to anyone's collection. also, i think that the people who gave this 1 and 2 stars are smoking some serious crack and possibly home now listening to Menudo albums. People who say they love the Beatles and knock this albums are poseurs. The Strawberry Fields remix kicks butt and John would be happy w. it if he was alive. Or how about the Tommorrow Never Knows mixed w. Within Without You, pure psychedelic bliss. This album rocks and all you haters keep listening to Menudo
B000002OX7|5.0|Great instrumentation, gut busting voacals, songs of defiance, anthems, worthy fillers, beginning to end excellence.  A true 5 star album.  The Who has forever sounded so different than any rock band and yet so rock and roll.  Keith Moons drumming flows with the music much different than those of groove style drummers, Entwistle's bass playing is electric and melodic and rhythmic and breathtaking all at the same time, Townshend's power chords and fitting stylized solos and unpretentious song writing (at this time of his career) was at its best.  Daltrey's scream in Won't Get Fooled Again says it all.  How about his anger in Behind Blue Eyes.  Enough said.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|What viewers should be thankful for, is that 75% of what Richard Donner filmed back in 1977 for Superman II is in this cut of the movie. Richard Donner states in his intro on this DVD that as much as what could be salvaged was put into the movie. After doing some Internet research, what was salvaged is still 75% of what he filmed back in 1977. If any of his footage was still lost or beyond repair, it was little things, such as a brief shot of Lex Luthor lighting a cigar here or there. <br /> <br />Yes, this cut of the movie has some rough patches here and there, but Donner's footage proves he had a more involving and adult take on the material than Richard Lester did. Why was Richard Lester hired for this job at all if he didn't have the same passion for the material that Richard Donner did? Even Lester admitted as much. And the producers ultimately hurt themselves by not keeping Donner on the project. <br /> <br />The restored Brando footage gives Superman II a restored epic feel that the first movie had. It also proves that Donner wanted that epic feel to continue from Superman I. Donner has a better skill directing actors than Richard Lester does. Whereas Clark and Lois throw dialogue at one another in the Lester footage, they are really acting in the Donner footage. Donner also skillfully and successfully brought out the chemistry between Lois and Clark, particuarly in the first scene on the DVD. <br /> <br />I suspect that Margot Kidder was not having a good time filming the Richard Lester directed scenes, as she looked physically ill and thin in most of them. More than likely, she missed the family atmosphere during filming that was there between herself, Richard Donner, Chris Reeve, and Gene Hackman while filming Superman I and parts of II. <br /> <br />It is very clear that if Richard Donner had been allowed to finish the movie, we would have had a far superior battle above Metropolis, the arrival of the criminals on Earth would have been better, and the Niagara Falls segment of the movie would have had the trademark Donner humor (more adult in tone) as opposed to Richard Lester's slapstick British humor. I'm sure Donner also would have used more of Valerie Perrine as Ms. Teschmacher. She had great chemistry with Hackman.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I bought this on an impulse from a brick and mortar store.  I had broken my second Garlic Genius and I was tired of the crappy $10 Chinese presses I'd gone through in a week or two.  It seemed like a lot of money but I've never been happier with a garlic press.  It's made in Germany, at least mine has a \\"Made in Germany\\" sticker, it's all stainless steel, and it's never broken, bent or frozen.  It perfectly minces the garlic, with all the fragrant juice extracted at the same time.  It's also very easy to clean because of the hinged design.
B000JJS8TM|2.0|I am an avid Beatles fan and have all their official CD releases and loads of their vinyl.  Conseqently I am familiar with their music.  This album allows you to hear a different spin on some of their most popular, as well as less well known, music.  The segues are fascinating and you will also hear snippets from versions other than the officially released tracks.  The mixing has, of course, been done on state of the art equipment and is beautifully crystal clear - top marks to EMI for: <br /> <br /> 1) Impeccable original recordings, and <br /> 2) Preserving those old recordings so well. <br /> <br />The clarity allows you to hear into parts of recordings that were previously 'buried in the mix'. <br /> <br />I approached this album in trepidation but I have found myself beguiled.  Fans and casual observers alike will definitely enjoys this.  Roll out the show in Europe please!
B00005JNS0|1.0|This was Such a Dissapointment.  It definately should not be rated G. <br />There is quite a bit of cussing and some sexual implications.  If you care about what your kids hear and repeat; Dont let them watch this film.  I was very Dissapointed in Disney this time.
B00066N8JS|5.0|Well I'll get straight to the point. The SACD version of the album is noticeably better than the 24/48 mix on the DualDisc's DVD-Audio portion.<br /><br />I will say that whether you're listening to the Dolby Digital 5.1, the 24/48 5.1 or the SACD 5.1, you're in for a treat. Trent Reznor and James Brown have really done an amazing job with this surround mix. The last minute of closer where a razor sounding blast comes 360 degress around your head will just make you smile.<br /><br />If you're listening with your eyes closed you'll swear the room is moving around you.<br /><br />The best news that I was so pleased to discover is that the second disc is SACD stereo! I never knew this before. Getting all the great remixes as well as such sweet tracks as Joy Division's Memorabilia and Dead Souls and NIN's Burn in SACD stereo is worth the price alone.<br /><br />Great disc, looking forward to The Fragile - I hope it receives the same treatment as this disc did.<br /><br />Please Trent get Pretty Hate Machine back and give us a Deluxe SACD edition as well. It's too good to miss.

0743298020|5.0|The real beauty of this book is the superb writing. The words sem almost magical, and they immediately trap you into this story. All through the book you wonder whether or not the old woman telling the story is, in fact, telling the truth or just making up a tale. Sometimes the writing is so excellent, you don't really care; you just want to go on reading! There is suspense and mystery, and a bit of the supernatural (possibly) in the book, but everything makes sense in the end, and all of the plot threads appear to be nicely fit together. I sincerely hope that this author graces us with another book of this quality in the future.

Of course, many purists will gasp at this statement and frantically search for their copies of \\"Once Sent From the Golden Hall,\\" but the fact is that this album surpasses even that monumental achievement in almost every way. Combining the thick production and mid-paced epic glory of recent efforts with their more aggressive early days, \\"With Oden on our Side\\" is a varied album that shows Amon Amarth at their best. The lyrics are typical Amon Amarth - Vikings, death, Ragnarok, war, etc, and the style has not really changed much, but this album still rocks like no other. The vocals are now more understandable than ever, a definate plus, and the faster pieces (i.e. Asator) show AA can still shred with the best of them. Once again, however, it is the slower numbers (Runes to My Memory, Cry of the Blackbirds) where Amon Amarth really stand out, taking the listener to times long past of courage and glory. Easily one of the best albums of 2006.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|First of all, this film is a great film!  It's one of the best films I've seen in some time.  If the right-wing nihilists weren't out in full force, do you think anyone would have a problem obeying the international laws that only United States refuses to implement?  You heard me right, and you heard Al Gore right, and this is what he said in my own words: the reason America won't get off its collective butts to install laws that recognize the existence of Global Warming is because of China.  That's right: China.<br /><br />Okay, here's a \\"weed whacker\\" if I ever saw one.  I'm going to quote someone else's review from here at Amazon called \\"The Epitome of Hypocracy.\\"  (I think the writer meant \\"hypocrisy\\" instead of \\"hypocracy.\\")  The article with that name is correctly labeled, sans misspelling, but the epitome of hypocrisy belongs to that reviewer, and not the person on whom she has laid her blame.  She calls herself \\"Stealth Kitten\\"  Isn't that ironic!  She's a clumsy writer.  I quote her statements here:<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Disclosure: Before you look at the one star review and your emotional belief system starts categorizing me as a Republican or a Bush supporter I would like to disclose that I despise both the republican and democratic parties which are in reality now two agents of the same agenda.\\"<br /><br />I know she'll be getting to her point soon; alas, I must wait.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"And I'm not here to debate whether or not global warming is a real phenomenon. I'm also a former employee of the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency].\\"<br /><br />Okay, so if she's not going to debate it, I guess that's because she agrees with it.  As an EPA employee, she'd be able to contest Al Gore's argument IF global warming does not exist.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"That being said, the idea that Al Gore (or any american president) is an environmentalist is patently absurd.\\"<br /><br />Did this lady watch the same film I did?  I just saw Al Gore preaching for TWO HOURS about the environment.  Who's she tryin' to kid?  He had scientific data, charts, and films.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Am I the only person who remembers that it was the Clinton administration that engineered the policy of the polution credits allowing companies who are polluters to actually pollute more?\\"<br /><br />WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?  Okay, so this complaint has no bearing on the film, but this lady wants people to talk about the credits of the Kyoto Protocol?  Lady, if you're complaining about the credit system, you've missed the boat.<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Like Bush and Cheney, Clinton and Gore manipulate and undermine the enviromentalist cause every chance they get.\\"<br /><br />Trite!<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"LOOK AT THE CAR AL GORE IS DRIVING IN THE FILM. Uhhh....\\"<br /><br />Over 30% of the world's greenhouse gases are emitted by the United States, but this woman is worried about which car Al Gore drives!  Hey lady, can you say ICE AGE?<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"It was the Clinton administration that made it legal to POISON U.S. CITIZENS by putting carcinogens in their food. Don't believe me? Look up the Delaney clause and The Food Quality Protection Act sometime.\\"<br /><br />Irrelevant.  She hasn't presented an argument without the trivial blame game!  Is she going to talk about the content of the film today?<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"The reality of CO2 emissions is that we could operate completely of of eco-friendly energy using 1920's TECHNOLOGY if there was not a political conspiracy in place in order to prevent that from happening. Electric cars, windmills, and especially hydro-electric power have been here for a hundred years. Hydro electric power is and always has been the most efficient, most enviromentally friendly way to to produce electricity... and anyone who tells you otherwise is probably putting out disinformation on behalf of a corporation or intelligence agency. A few more dams the size of hoover and niagra could easily power north america and we could certainlyhave electric cars.\\"<br /><br />I think she's saying that global warming does exist, and she agrees that people should do something about it.  Didn't Al Gore say this?<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"The real agenda here is that Al Gore's handlers have ordered him to use the environmentalist cause to bring about world socialist government which is what the agenda of people like Bush and Gore has been for a long time.\\"<br /><br />WHAT A FRUITCAKE!  She's confused!  This is outright presumptuous slander.  Notice how she mixes opinions in with her \\"facts.\\"  And, does anyone think Bush is attempting to \\"bring about world socialist government?\\"  NO, THEY DON'T!  She's arguing from a figment of her imagination, but contrary to her earlier argument, this one says that Gore IS BEING an environmentalist!<br /><br />QUOTE--\\"Wake up kids. If you want a real documentary watch 9/11 mysteries or Terror Storm.\\"<br /><br />Boy, that is the worst review of this film I've read so far.  She doesn't mention anything in the film, except that Al Gore starred in it.  What was she trying to say anyway?  It sounded like confusion and frustration.  Lady, you're a nut!<br /><br />What's worse is that a few nut bags deny every politician who try to do a job and provide a basic service to the American people.  There are TWO definitions to the word democracy, the OTHER ONE is REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT, of which we have little-to-none.  Al Gore knows what he believes and what he's fighting for is good to Americans.  While the Americans are sitting on their collective butts, the rest of the world has adopted the Kyoto Protocol.  Why not the Americans?<br /><br />Because, CHINA.  Or, because CREDITS.  I'd like someone to explain to me what China has to do with whether or not America adopts the Kyoto Protocol!  I mean, if America is the greatest, most \\"moral-est\\" country in the world, why does it take A CONVENIENT STANCE?  Because, then America can ignore the problem?  Of course, this to completely ignore the facts of the movie telling people that China is WAAAAAAY ahead of the United States in its greenhouse-gas emission standards!<br /><br />Those are great morals, America!  At this rate, the world will have another Ice Age much sooner.  What do you want, a pat on the back too?<br /><br />America is in denial of the change the world needs.<br /><br />If you're saying this is socialism, then you're a retard.<br /><br />Hey, is saving lives socialism too?t it.

B00006I53S|5.0|Pros: Affordable, IS works, focal length (28-135) is good for a general purpose lens <br />Cons: IQ in low light, 28 is not wide enough for 1.6x bodies <br /> <br />Recommend for beginners like myself, great focal length, IS works well but IQ in low light is definitely not L. USM is very quiet & auto-focus is very fast.
B0002858YS|5.0|Actually, \\"You had me at the first note\\" is more appropriate.<br /><br />Why am I paraphrasing the tag line from Jerry McGuire? Well, because that movie and this album have one major thing in common. Both are all about relationships and the fact that - despite what men will say - it is not all about sex and themselves. A successful relationship with someone you love requires two essential acts: commitment and the subordination of ego and super-ego.<br /><br />Achieving that sort of maturity is not easy. Even for those perceptive enough to realize they must travel that road, the risk of ending up in the ditch is high. The Killers know this and it shows in their music which is rather remarkable in light of the relative chronological youth of keyboardist Brandon Flowers who did the bulk of the songwriting. While his three band mates are pushing past 30, Flowers is still in his mid 20s. The maturity of his lyrics implies a deep and clear understanding of what it takes to make a relationship work and what it takes to survive after one fails.<br /><br />Most of the songs on this album - I speak of the original Hot Fuss with 11 tracks; I'm planning to remedy that problem with the singles-enhanced version ASAP - are amazingly free of immature attitudes, emotions and phrasing. If there is a sour note it is `Andy, You're a Star,' which carries a bit of pretentiousness in words and melodies.<br /><br />And speaking of the music; be prepared for a joyful event. This album has some of the finest production I have heard in the last few years. Yes, the band is influenced by Brit bands, but no, it is not influenced by the negative side of DIY in which everything sounds like a demo! Instead, there is, by and large, a rich texture and atmosphere to virtually every song that - as good production values and exposition will do - draws the listener into not just the song, but the narrator's soul as well.<br /><br />One cannot hope for more than this. That is why this album should be on everyone's shelf.ld be on everyone's shelf. <br /> <br />
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I personally like Gwen's work better when she was with No Doubt. I am not much of a fan of her new work with the sing-rap, although creative, it doesnt allow her to showcase her vocal abilities.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks: <br />The Sweet Escape <br />Dont Get It Twisted <br />Yummy <br /> <br />p.s. is it just me or does orange county girl sound like a brooke hogan type track?
0743289412|4.0|I can't think of any other way to describe King's newest work.  It's quite a departure for him, in that there is no evil force out to conquer the world (or at least his little portion of it), as has been the case in almost all of his books, with the notable exceptions of \\"Carrie\\" and \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\".  But unlike the latter work, there are definite and obvious supernatural elements involved in this story. <br /> <br />As it opens, Lisey Landon's husband, the celebrated author Scott Landon, has been dead for two years, and Lisey (pronounced \\"LEE-see\\") is learning to cope with a world in which her husband is no longer a part of her life.  But it seems that some elements of that world are not quite ready to let her do that, most notably a certifiable nutjob named Jim Dooley, who mistakenly thinks that a university professor has given him carte blanche to obtain Scott's papers and books for him by any means possible. <br /> <br />That's not the entire story, of course, but it is the main part of it.  There's also a flashback involving an attempted asassination of Scott back in the 90's; Lisey's current dilemma involving her sister Amanda, who is apparently by turns catatonic and suicidal; and Scott's and Lisey's journeys to a mysterious place called Boo'ya Moon - about which you'll need to read the book, because I'm not going to spoil your fun. <br /> <br />This is not on the same level as King's best work - \\"Salem's Lot\\", \\"The Shining\\", or the unabridged \\"The Stand\\" - but it's nowhere near as bad as \\"Firestarter\\" or \\"Pet Sematery\\".  This book is definitely a keeper.
B000002AH7|5.0|Sketches of Spain is one of my favorite of Miles Davis' fusion works.  Here, he fuses the sounds of Spain with American Jazz.  It's not nearly as radical as much of his fusion work, but it's not likely to be heard on an elevator either.  If you've enjoyed Miles' easiest-to-listen-to-albums (for example, Kind of Blue, Birth of the Cool), and you want to be challenged just a little more, take a listen to Sketches of Spain.
1582406723|5.0|Robert Kirkman (Invincible) crafted this smash hit ongoing title, which adds a bit of innovation to the very well-worn zombie genre.  The Walking Dead centers around a cop named Rick, who wakes up out of a coma to find that the whole world has succumbed to a zombie plague outbreak, and everywhere is overrun with the murderous flesh eaters.  As Rick fights to survive and avoid becoming someone's meal, he searches for his missing wife and son, who he soon finds out are alive and well, and with his old partner Shane, who hasn't really taken to this new world quite so well.  And that's only the beginning of when things start to go downhill.  Throughout Days Gone Bye, Rick finds other survivors, some will live, and others will die in future volumes, but rest assured that this TPB is only a short taste of things to come.  Tony Moore's stark, black and white artwork does the job, and his zombie drawings look wonderful.  All in all, if you dig Days Gone Bye, just wait, because things get even better.
0307346609|4.0|For a horror novel, this is strangely compelling.  Overall Brooks does a great job capturing the different voices of the survivors of the conflict.  I was hooked from page 1 and couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />There's some stinging political commentary in here, as Brooks takes aim at everything from the Iraq war to Hollywood culture.  Brooks doesn't beat the reader over the head with his message, instead letting the story speak for itself.  I really enjoyed this approach, and at times felt as if Brooks had actually interviewed the survivors.   <br /> <br /> <br />The Great Panic portion of the book really shines.  My only gripe was this part of the book was far too short!  I would have loved to see that section doubled (or even spin off into a novel of its own).

B000I0QM04|5.0|I may be in the minority but I really enjoyed this movie. From the retro 'CG heavy' visuals to the 1930's movie seriel feel, this movie is  a breath of fresh air. The characters are transparent as cartoon characters but it all fits together nicely to create a unique movie experience.
1400049628|4.0|I'm not a big zombie fan.  Sure, I've seen all the major movies, but it isn't like I own all the DVD's or anxiously await the next Romero flick.  I picked this up on a whim-started skimming through it and thought it was pretty funny.  It is pretty much what it says it is-It is an exhaustive survial guide for the next zombie attack.  He gives numberous scenarios for what to do when a zombie attacks you, or when you attack a zombie, or just general rules of thumb while you wait for that doomsday attack.  At the end of the book he gives a large list of authentic zombie attacks throughout history.  Some of them are connected, and, at times, I was a bit creeped out by them.  If you're a zombie fan and you haven't picked up this book, by all means grab it-you'll get a kick out of it.  I think even people who aren't that intersted in zombies will like this.
B000H305U0|5.0|I have to say that I really resisted getting this album when it first came out. I would classify myself as a heavy R&B/Soul music fan but only a casual fan of Mr. Timberlake. I purchased his first album \\"Justified\\" when it came out and even though I thought it had some really good songs on it, overall I was dissapointed with the album and felt that it was overrated. Unlike most people, I hated \\"Sexyback\\" when I first heard it on the radio and that further caused me to resist buying Futuresex/Lovesounds. Then I saw the video for his second single \\"My Love\\" on MTV and I was like \\"whoa, that song is pretty tight!\\". I finally broke down and bought the album and I was amazed! <br /> <br />Futuresex/Lovesound is my opinion is miles better than Justified (even though the songs on it are in the same family). It sounds like Justin has actually found himself now as opposed to just trying to break away from his pop image and prove he's an R&B singer (which was what his first album was all about). With the new one, he has more edgy beats more inventive lyrics and more variety. He also shows off his voice more and proves that he is actually a really decent singer! Justin has a wonderful penchent for imitating artists like Michael Jackson and even Prince with his falsetto singing style, vocal improvisations and his eclectic mix of funk, R&B, and Pop. But Justin also has his own style to show off and clearly separates himself from his idols with personalized lyrics, hip-hop collaborations, Timbaland beats and even some rapping. If he continues to be as consistant as this in his future releases, he will be a star that we will see for a long time in the music industry. <br /> <br />Song Reviews: I like every song on the album except the title track \\"Futuresex/Lovesound\\" and the first single \\"Sexyback\\". The former sounding more like an overlong intro/filler and the ladder...well I just didn't like the digitized voice or the fact that the song was overhyped and overplayed. \\"My Love\\" is a great track, catchy and smooth with a nice variety between falsetto and lower register vocals. \\"Lovestoned\\" is also a great song. It has a very original style and it's a long song that extends itself almost into a completley different tempo like a mini rhapsody. \\"What Goes Around\\" is another song that accomplishes that beat change which keeps it fresh after the 6 minute mark. \\"Chop Me Up\\" is a song that demostrates his ability to rap (though he doesn't overdue it). \\"Damn Girl\\" is one of my favorite tracks. Being a hugh Prince fan, I was surprised to hear Justin actually doing a Prince-esq song. With lyrics like \\"Don't need no Maybelline, Cause you're a beauty queen... <br />Don't need no L'oreal, Cause bitch you're bad as hell\\", all sung in high falsetto with a few screeching vocal ad libs inbetween, I though I was listening to the sequel to Prince's \\"Kiss\\". \\"Summer Love\\" is the one song on the album that sounds like a throwback to his NSYNC days. It's not particlarly edgy but it's definetely catchy and radio friendly. \\"Until The End Of Time\\" is another Prince like song, right down to the musical composition. This time, he sounds like he's doing the sequel to \\"Scadalous\\" by Prince. As you can imagine it's also one of my favorites. In \\"Loosing My Way\\" he goes in the other direction, a little homage to Michael Jackson in a nice midtempo choir backed ballad. Towards the end of the song when he adlibs, it will remind you of \\"Man In The Mirror\\". All he needed were a few \\"hee-hee's\\" and \\"woo-hoo's\\" and voila, you've got a great Michael Jackson song! \\"All Over Again\\" is Justin's soulful piano backed ballad that's all about showcasing his range and flexibility as a vocalist. Minus two, Futuresex/Lovesounds is a collection of great R&B/Soul songs that you will want to listen to \\"all over again\\".
0812974611|4.0|Granted, the author's characterizations weren't deep, but I don't think that was his intent. He wanted to bring the eruption to life (!) by showing the events surrounding it. An excellent rendition.  <br /> <br />Water flows changed by earth movements? Right on! Blind optimism in the face of disaster? Right on! It can't happen here? Right on! <br /> <br />The author provides an excellent insight into the life and times of the period. This is a novel about history, not a novel about people. Although the people aren't ignored. <br /> <br />I found the book very fascinating.
B000002UJQ|5.0|... If the opening riff to \\"Airbag\\" doesnt immediately tell you you are in for a ride on one of the most emotionally intense - while at the same time, *chillingly cold* - albums you've ever heard... then, again, you aren't human.  <br /> <br />I even went to a book review of a release for a rock critic author's new book on \\"Overrated Rock Albums\\", who's main theme of his speach was \\"Why 'OK Computer', Sucks\\".  My wife and I let him have it - he was forewarned, but he at least understood we had our own points.  He didnt get it.  I suspect many other people won't as well.  <br /> <br />If you DON'T buy this album then, what? You're out $13 or something?  Give it to your neighbors kid.  If you like it, then you wont just *like* it, it will be engrained in your conscience.  There are hundreds - i dunno thousands - of reviews of this album.  It's been called \\"The Best Album since the Beatles\\" in Britain....  Throw down your $13 and decide for yourself.  <br /> <br />
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It is great fun to identify all the bits and pieces that George Martin and his son put together and second guess their choices. They use the same approach as Martin did on Abbey Road. This is the best repackaging of material since the King James version of the Bible.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|First, I've been a Beatles fan since I was 14 in 1964, watched all their live performances on the Ed Sulllivan Show, and attended their two concerts Seattle, Washington. Second, do not buy this album if you expect to hear Beatles songs as originally produced and released. It's not the album for you, and you will be disappointed. But, third, do buy this album if you want to hear Beatles songs mixed and mashed lovingly in unique ways. The production is by orignal Beatles producer George Martin and his son, and they know what they're doing--with the approval of the Beatles and their families.
0743289412|1.0|This book is an incoherent mess and pretty much unreadable. I used to look foward to each and every King book, but this one is the bottom of what has been a long slow slide.  In a way this book is sort of like a very bad first draft of a book, perhaps it could have been a good book eventually.  The plot was depressing and over the top, none of the characters are likeable or even developed as characters.  The language, dialogue, and thoughts of the characters are uniformly unpleasant.  The overuse of \\"smucking\\" and \\"bool\\" are annoying. <br />    I would sum this book up in one word:  unpleasant.
0060734191|5.0|Words cannot express my love for this trilogy. I first discovered \\"Sabriel\\" when I was 12 years old and browsing a small corner of my school's library dedicated to \\"teen\\" books. Sabriel stood out to me in a way that no other book has - or probably ever will - and I soon devoured it with a passion. Soon after, Garth Nix released the novel's two sequels (\\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsen\\") and to this day I consider the Abhorsen trilogy to be my favorite fantasy series (this coming from someone who loves Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings as well). <br /> <br />The main character of two of the three novels is Lirael, a young woman who is somewhat of an outcast among Clayr society (women who can see the future). Lirael has never been gifted with the Sight, and in a way is shunned from the society she lives in. To make matters worse, her mother abandoned Lirael when she was just five years old, and her Aunt Kirrith - the only family Lirael has left - pays little attention to her. However, Lirael has a gift that the Clayr do not: instead of looking into the future, Lirael is a Remembrancer, someone who can see the past. In Lirael and Abhorsen, Lirael must learn to accept her gift, because she is the only one who can discover how to stop Orranis, the Destroyer. With her friends Prince Sameth, the Disreputable Dog, and Mogget, Lirael journeys to stop Orranis before it is too late. <br /> <br />Of course, Sabriel (the main character of the first novel who also has a minor role in the other two) cannot be overlooked. She is more accepting of her destiny than Lirael is, and is also one of the strongest female heroines that I have ever read. She is certainly someone that young readers (such as my 12-year-old self) can look up to. Her story is completely different from \\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsen\\" (Abhorsen is a direct sequel to Lirael, whereas Lirael is merely a continuance of the world Nix created), and I almost wish Nix had included more of her in the sequels. <br /> <br />Like the Harry Potter series, Garth Nix's stories have that \\"coming of age\\" feel to them, and like Harry Potter, they are written in such a way that any person - young or old - can read, enjoy, and connect with the age-old themes present in the series. If that doesn't win you over, I should probably add that Garth Nix is one of the funniest writers I have stumbled upon. The one regret I have about this series is that it is not popular enough; very few people know of the wonders of the Old Kingdom trilogy.
078681859X|5.0|This story has multiple surfaces. For the younger set, it is straightforward fantasy, but with well done narration employing a nice approach of switching between a general narrator and the Genie (djinni). The wise-cracking Genie keeps it interesting, especially with snarky footnotes. A lot of references to our (real) world's ancient and 20th century history recasts the actual events within this strange world of hidden beings. But, the story also has multiple layers of meaning. In many ways, it is far more about the dangers of class, isolation, alienation, propaganda, and the \\"winners writing the history books\\". <br />The story, as explained above and below, is about a boy apprenticed at a very young age into the world of the leaders (remember the Nazi leaders adopting \\"Arayan\\" children to raise them \\"properly\\"). The boy's real name is to be hidden so as to protect him (due to the dangers of \\"demons\\" knowing your real name). Of course, the larger issue is the suppression of his own real identity. But, his adoptive mother (the wife of the magician) does not cotton to this and uses his name (at his peril). Again, there is a lot of story in the story. Unlike Harry Potter, this is not about \\"magic\\" powers within the people, but rather the strict control of knowledge/technology and power. That is, magicians only learn how to use the correct words to control a whole array of magical beings from another world. The \\"commoners\\" are simply those suppressed from such knowledge. <br />The story of Kitty (in the 2nd) book and her \\"trial\\" takes this to a much farther level. Many poor and minorities in any country may feel that trial hits very close to home. Hopefully many of these parallels to our own world will sink in to teens who read this, helping them avoid the foolish arrogance that Nathaniel suffers from.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This is a truly wonderful and well-done effort, and a true Holiday Classic in the vein of \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" \\"A Christmas Story,\\" \\"How The Grinch Stole Christmas (Boris Karloff Version)\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" The idea to use motion-capture animation just added to the mystique and feel of the movie as well. It is amazing how realistic the movie looks; the characters do not look animated at all, in my view. The story is timeless too-a young boy (who is only called \\"Hero-Boy\\" in the film) who has lost his faith in Christmas boards a mysterious train, The Polar Express, where the Conductor (voiced by Tom Hanks) is desperately trying to get back to the North Pole before Santa makes his run. He meets \\"Hero-Girl,\\" an African-American about his same age, a young boy named Billy (also known as \\"Lonely-Boy\\") and \\"Know-It-All,\\" a somewhat too smart for his own good young boy. The journey has many twists and turns to the North Pole, including a meeting with a mysterious Hobo (also voiced by Hanks). All of the children have a \\"Golden Ticket\\" with letters punched onto them (the significance of this is revealed by the end of the movie). The boy meets Santa at the North Pole, although does not believe in him at first. I will not give away too much more, but this is a true Holiday Classic which deserves to be in every DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie.
B000E41MS6|2.0|I was quite excited at the prospect of a new Doctor Who series - the old show is a classic, a powerful icon of sci-fi culture.  What we have here, however, is a greatly flawed revamp of the show.  The writer and producers obviously went all out to reshape and redefine the entire Dr Who legend, no doubt to draw in a new generation of viewers.  One aspect you could definitely describe as an improvement - the CG effects are quite impressive and lightyears ahead of what they had twenty years ago.  Apart from that, however, there is little that I can say in its favour.  It has a sleekness to it which is very modern, and perhaps over-emphasised.  The main issues I have with this version are:<br /><br />The One Episode Story Format over the Old Multi-Episode Story Format:  Most stories in the old Doctor Who ran for several half-hour episodes.  At the end of each half-hour there would be some sort of cliff-hanger.  In this new version, the setting for the story is introduced, the Dr and his companions walk around finding out what is going on, and after twenty minutes or so, a highly dangerous situation would become a apparent - eg. A practically unstoppable Dalek becomes active.  Then the pace would begin to quicken, the situation would appear hopeless, and in some completely corny way, it would be resolved in the final couple of minutes.<br /><br />In the meantime, we would be subject to an enormous amount of sentimentality as the Dr and his companions talk about their feelings or gaze into each other's eyes or something else as equally inane and inappropriate for the situation they are in.  Why so much emotionalism?  Is it due to that Russell T. Davies guy?  Is he forgetting which genre Dr Who is?  Please get a new writer.<br /><br />  By changing the format of the show, they have sabotaged a very effective formula for the telling of stories in the Dr Who universe.  It worked for decades.  Why did they change it?<br /><br />  This format also includes the most grating musical scores I have ever been subjected to.  It mirrors the exponentially accelerating pace of each episode, getting louder and more obnoxious as it moves along.  By the time you get to the overly-dramatic and implausible resolution of the episode, you are being bombarded by a cacophony of sound right off the decibel range.  It doesn't add to the drama, it just enrages you.<br /><br />  The last issue I wish to mention is the layout of the TARDIS - it's organic look, like a greenhouse merged with a bad abstract painting, doesn't work.  The console might look appropriate in a old oil refinery that nature has tried to claim back, but not as the central controls and brain of a ultra-advanced space/time vehicle.  What highly advanced beings would design something like that?!have ever been subjected to.

B000JJRIN4|2.0|This CD is a big disappointment.  I really liked her last CD but this one falls short.  It doesn't flow well and some songs have sounds that you would make if you were cooing a baby.  She talks about liking to ride, but I wouldn't be caught dead ridin' to this CD.  Less motherhood, more rock please.
B000JSI7DK|4.0|One of the only films in my top ten list that seems to get better every time I see it. Rocky Balboa is one of the most charming down on his luck loser's the cinema has ever seen. The film sweeps a range of emotions from hope where it was all but gone to chill you to the bone despair. A film of loneliness, surrender and ultimately redemption. Just re-watched the scene where Mickey comes to ask Rocky if he can manage him. The fear in the sub-text and in Rocky's eyes is so tragic and beautiful. I still get caught up in it after dozens of viewings. Just amazing.    Movie 5.0 out 5.0 stars    Blu-ray details    The picture quality is stellar, grainy and wonderful. There are some inconsistencies in the shadows during the fight and of course a large color shift when they cut to stock footage of the audience, but most if not all of these artifacts are probably from the original release. The sound is tinny here and there and over modulates once in a while, again I think this probably due to the original sound track being 30 years old but it is distracting on occasion.    The biggest disappointment is the lack of extras. MGM simultaneously released a collector's edition 2 disc DVD of ROCKY with commentary from Stallone and hours of behind the scenes and documentaries on the film. Unfortunately none of these are on the Blu-ray edition. The only extra is the original theatrical trailer. Quite a disappointment and although the picture is great, I would have opted for the DVD if I knew ahead of time. A 30 year old film is technically sub-par to what we see today and seeing it on a DVD vs. a Blu-ray Disc is probably not a hugely dramatic difference. I suggest saving a few bucks and getting a lot more with the 2 Disc DVD.    Blu-ray score, due to lack of available extras: 3.0 out of 5.0
B0001GL3K4|5.0|<br />This is such a well-written piece on romantic relationships. Its success lie in its wide appeal. I ask my friends and all have their own favorite characters and moments in the movie. I watched it 3 times and I find my favorite scenes change too. There is the writer (Colin Firth)'s proposal  to his Portugese maid. Not to forget the hilarious Hugh Grant performing his dance sequence. Keira Knightly with her secret admirer opening his heart to her at the doorstep can be overwheming. Not to mention the modern London feel throughout the movie.  <br /> <br />These wonderful short stories are so fragmented when I watched it the first time there is a longing for more. It allows me to repeat watching the movie again with nice surprises here and there. The fact that each piece is so short allows the audience to feel rather than being told the story.  <br /> <br />This is one of the few romantic classics in recent years that arouses such warm and deep feelings from a wide range of audience - young and old. An excellent combo of romantic moments that can truly stand the test of time.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|This album is definitely pt 2 of LAMB. It is fun and new. Just like her freshman cd. I don't understand why everyone is being so harsh about this album. It's Gwen, you know that she expiraments with new sounds, so if your not up for the adventure, then don't get the cd!!!!
0446672653|5.0|I read this book years ago and it has just come true for me...literally.Ironically,I saw this book lying on a table in my bedroom,about a year before I met my soulmate.It should not have been there and yet it was.I picked it up,remembered reading it in my early twenties,smiled and put it away in a box.Roughly a year later it happened...I met her...the one...and the circumstances behind that meeting were staggering and cosmic beyond belief.I am still shaking my head in amazement.We are actually psychic with one another!I am ordering this book for her and we are also writing our own book detailing our mind-blowing connection.If you're out there searching,all I can tell you is,don't give in to despair.Let your faith and your soul show you the way.It can and does happen.I know,because it happened to me.
B00004Y6TQ|2.0|These songs are great n all like everything Bjork does (in my opinion), but i fell in love with the film and the film's soundtrack and this is not the film's soundtrack.  All of the songs are redone.  My favorite song for instance is \\"I've Seen It All\\" and i get Thom Yorke instead of Jeff(Peter Stormare).  Love Thom and all but prefer Jeff for sentimental ties i have with the film.  and Scatterheart?!?  None of the lyrics are even the same and Bill(David Morse) and Linda(Cara Seymour) are not singing!  The others are the same story..  Isn't the whole point of a musical the fact that a bunch of people in the movie are singing in context with the plot?  If you listened to the soundtrack you'd never guess it was the soundtrack to a musical.. Anyway the songs are great but it's not really a soundtrack to me and i can't help but be very dissapointed and sad that i can't have the songs i want other than having to listen to the film.
B000001GOZ|5.0|First off, let me say that the buisness about andante/scherzo vs. scherzo/andante means very little to me. Perhaps it should, but it just doesn't. Either way, this is still a very finale driven symphony. Boulez follows his first movement with the scherzo, which was the accepted way of doing things for at least three or four decades. These days, the Mahler P.C. Squad has all but outlawed S/A performances, based on what they believe to be definitive information (I'm not so convinced). But doing the Mahler 6th is S/A order, also means that the conductor has to be very judicious about his/her tempo relationships between the first and second movements. Do you start the scherzo at the same tempo as the begining of the entire sympony, or at roughly the same tempo as the end of the first movement (usually far faster)? Wisely, Boulez chooses a tempo that's right down the middle between that of the first movement's opening march (with Boulez, that's a tad slower than normal), and his ending of the first movement (which isn't overly fast either, but still faster than the start). This may seem rather didactic, but I think it gives the impression of Boulez being \\"correct\\" over the long haul - something that I don't always get from him. In fact, this is perhaps the most \\"classical\\" performance of the sixth that I can think of - sort of like a giant Haydn symphony from his sturm and drang period, but on steroids. Yes, Boulez's two hammerstrokes in the finale are a tad underwhelming. But who cares? - we all know what loud hammmer strokes sound like these days. I could go on, but I'll just wrap up by stating that all four movements are equally strong on this performance, regardless of their inner pecking order (mix and match if you like - make the slow movement the finale and pretends it's the 9th!). Believe me, that's not always the case. Obviously, the Vienna Phil. knows this piece really well - perhaps the one Mahler symphony that they nearly always get right. Here, Boulez is a bit of a non-interventionist, and just let's them play. One could make far dumber moves than that. Along with his somewhat underrated VPO Mahler 3rd, I think that Boulez's sixth is still his best Mahler recording to date. At the very least, it's certainly his most classically structured one.it of a non-interventionist, and just let's them play. One could make far dumber moves than that.

B000HWZ61Y|5.0|I looked high and low for the original recording of Tear it Down and now I finally have it.  Good stuff.  Felt like I had a mullet all over again.  Good times.  The B Sides are surprisingly well recorded and all of the remastering really pays off.  The live tracks are phenomenal and genuine sounding.  Buy this.  You won't regret.  It'll add ten years to your life.  A great booklet comes with it as well.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Basically just another amazing album from Sigur Ros. I can understand how some people dislike the music because it really does take a little patience to get into. The songs are slow and long, so if your in a hurry you might as well pass on this music. With that said, there's some incredibly beautiful music to be heard on this disc and I wouldn't recommend passing it up. Highlights are \\"Svefn g englar\\", \\"Staralfur\\", \\"Flugufrelsarinn\\", \\"Vidrar vel til loftarasa\\" & \\"Olsen olsen\\"
B0001XALTG|5.0|Calling \\"Trainspotting\\" the funniest film ever made about heroin addiction doesn't begin to do it justice - but it is. There's a strain of dark humor that runs through this adaptation of the Irvine Welsh novel which is inescapable - from clever little asides like \\"We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit\\" to hallucinations of AIDS-based game shows to Spud's speed-freaked job interview (not to mention Irvine Welsh's own cameo as a hopelessly out-of-his-depth dealer).  <br /> <br />\\"Trainspotting\\" is a movie based on a book about the complexities of heroin addiction in 1990s Edinburgh, but neither the book or the film is any sort of morality play. We get to see heroin addicts in all stages of their habit (up to and including death), but the filmmakers are smart enough not to impose outside values on their actions, letting the characters speak for themselves. The result is frequently grotesque, sometimes surreal, occasionally enlightening- and as mentioned before, very often funny as hell, and all of it delivered in thick Edinburgh accents and patois.  <br /> <br />The real strength of the film, though, is in the ensemble casting and the excellent performances this draws out of Ewan McGregor as Renton, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, and the very much underrated Ewen Bremner (was \\"Alien vs. Predator /really/ the best gig he could get after this?) as the hopeless Spud. Robert Carlyle delights in what has proven to be an unusual turn for him as the completely mental Begbie- but comparing this role to the rest of his work just makes it more fun.  <br />
0393317552|5.0|There are many reviewers here that make great comments on the strengths of this ambitious work; Some others are deeply driven by their obvious political bias. If you approach this text with an open mind and with a notion to keep judgment at a minimum, the book illuminates the inherent forces and pre-conditions that has set societies in motion: Diamond does a superb job of carefully threading through the vagaries associated with developed modern Human society. This is a fantastic piece of scholarship.
0345349571|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. Tuchman takes a subject that would make most people's eyes glaze over, 14th century france, and renders it easy to follow and gripping. If you have even a passing interest in history this book is a must have.
B00004TVV1|5.0|A gift from the heavens.  Listened to Azalea 66 times in a row when I first heard this lp.    <br />First review above by Jean-Marie from France hits the nail right on the head.  Good job.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This film is a memorial for all the men and women who lived and died at pearl harbor on december 7, 1941. powerful, emotional, and etepoping special effects.
B00005JPCA|1.0|I cannot understand anybody's reason for praising this movie. I've loved 007 films for years and I admit the last two that where made where CGI overkill and not a top film, but all it needed was a better director and scriptwriters.    So they come up with the idea to jump on the Batman Begins wagon and re-invent something that wasn't broken?    When I first saw the preview/trailer of this, and hearing about this as being a prequel, I saw an instant mistake when Judy Dench was shown as being M in the film. A prequel that ignores the fact that she wasn't the original M character, she took over as M in Goldeneye(or one of the Brosnon ones) because the Original M died or retired or something and she was next in line, or the wife or something, I dunno, but the point is she wasn't there in the beginning. And the excuse I heard was that this isn't a prequel, its a complete restart like Batman Begins. OK, I let that one slip by and ended up seeing the film.    The start of the film bored the hell out of me, it was so slow, and dragged, and didn't even show how Bond became a double-0 agent, it's more like starting from his first day AS a 00. Then the rest of the film lagged and then action, then bore, then action, then lag, then bore then action, then what, then zzzzz, then \\"so that's it then is it?\\"    As I said, being a Bond fan for over 20 movies, why try and fix what's not broken? This film is not a Bond film, it just has the character names, the 00 status and the theme music, and the theme music of the trademark guitar theme didn't even get played in the movie, it was just used in the closing credits.    How can you call this a Bond film when you have Dr Who not fitting into the spot of a Bond type, men aren't my thing, but I cant imagine women seeing him as charming and sophisticated with a license to thrill them.     Amongst everything else, no Q, no gadgets, no charm, not the right kind of smartarse replies expected from a Bond, no Money Penny, and he's gone from what we know Bond as to more of a dull egotistical and boring character that acts more depressing then anything else.     I don't get it, I really don't understand how any fans of Bond could seriously see this as a decent Bond film? I'd probably think it was an average and forgetful film if it was titled something else and didn't use the Bond names and trademarks, but this will never be accepted by me as a Bond film.    I honestly can't believe that only a small majority of reviewers have seen the movie the way I did. Either the world had gone mad, or there is only reviews being written by people who have never seen a Bond film before because all the ones who have are still in shock, puking in the car park or still at the ticket office demanding a refund.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|The best way I can describe Ray's voice is that I want to swim in it.  I bought this album first, before Trouble, and I can honestly say that the tracks on this CD are filled with so much power, so much passion, that I have no choice but to close my eyes and try and take it all in every time I hear it. <br />I have not felt this way about an artist in years, one of those I can't take this CD out of the player kind of artists.  His voice is somewhere between the cries of Joe Cocker, the hear melting lyrics of Nick Drake,Elliott Smith, or Jeff Buckley, and the soul of Otis Redding....it's honestly one of the best things I have ever heard.  It makes me hungry for MORE!!! And if you think that's great, you should see him live!
B0000019PA|5.0|This album is just absolutly superb.  The closest listening experience I''ve had is when I first listened to The Velvet Underground and Niko.  A wonderfull almost creapy feeling came over me.  Some people have complained about vocals?  It seems to me that a lot of people have had these fake auto-tuned Brittney Spears-like voices drummed into their heads and they think that that's what vocals should sound like.  Buy this album.  You WILL NOT regret it.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|This album is further proof she needs to either return to no doubt and only no doubt or just quit....its really a horrid album and I bet she knows it, thank god I didnt pay for it.

B000GIWS7E|1.0|Sorry that I can't post a -5 STAR rating.  A friend of mine just bought this DVD, and I happened to be there for the showing, and soon found out that I picked the wrong night for a visit.<br /><br />  Harmonic guitar rifts, intricate bass lines, endless drum rolls and a screaming-out-of-key vocalist (using the term loosely) rambling on with artsy lyrics only to be broken up by a crunching in time break.<br /><br />  I guess that every generation has it's share of bands that are VOID-OF-RHYTHM and rely on pure musician school timing and these guys are the poster child for \\"Concert of the Boring!\\"
0767802470|4.0|EVen though this movie is more than twenty years old, it really is a masterpiece in many aspects.  It arguably jump-starts Wolfgang Petersen's career in Hollywood and also, Jurgen Prochnow.  It's quite a feat to film the movie in such a tight space but in the name of authenticity, the Director wouldn't have it any other way.  It's quite nerve-wrecking to sit through the tensions, the unknowns when the crew is fighting to get the U-Boat refloat again.  Where U-571 (the movie) is tighter and more action-packed and Widowmaker (starring Harrison Ford & Liam Neeson) concentrates more onto the characters, Das Boot is a bit of both.  However, it shall be noted that it's THE movie that started it all.  After spending more than three hours with the crew, it's not difficult to imagine why we get ourselves emotionally attached to them.  It's not a propoganda movie or there to suggest who's the \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" side but simply a movie about the band of brother sticking together to get the job done and done well.  There is also poignant moment where the Captain has to make a decision of whether to save the enemy's surviving crew or leaving them for dead.  An unmissable experience.  It's best to watch it in German language applying English subtitles for the authenticity feel.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|To the peopel who are complaining how generic this album is, wrong. This is some of Incubus' most ambitious work to date, extremely unconventional for them adn it takes a dramatic step towards prog-rock, which is a great sound for them. <br />Peopel are complaining that Brandon's lyrics are not so great..have they ever honestly been 'amazing?' Not really, he's always been a pretty good frontman, and the lyrics he wrote for this CD are some of the most intricate he's ever penned. He delves into topics and uses creative analogies. For instance, the title track, Light Grenades is a great idea for change. Instead of using destructive bombs and war to make a difference and alter the status quo, Brandon makes the suggestion to \\"lob the light grenades,\\" which means to using something mesmerizing and ultimately peaceful to change.  <br />I also see a complaint that he's not using his full singing ability...Huh...Look back to early CDs like SCIENCE or really early, Fungus Amongus, Brandon was just a plain Nu-Metal rapper, and a lot of that carried over through Morning View. Now, he's writing creative melodies and actually singing. ANd he's really good. There's nothing wrong with singing fast, and he even pulls it off well by..well, not sucking. <br />The first time i listened to this CD, i didn't like it. Then after each successive listen, i liked it more and more, and now it is my all around favorite Incubus cd, and it's my favorite.  <br />Every single track is good. Some are definitely a lot better tha nothers, but all are album quality. I definitely recomend downloading the two b-sides, 'Punchdrunnk' and \\"Look ALive!' Both are great and also could have easily been on the CD. <br />My personal favorites are \\"Pendulous Threads, \\"Dig,\\" \\"Light Grenades,\\" \\"Anna Molly,\\" \\"Rogues,\\" \\"Oil and Water, \\"Diamonds and Coal,\\" and \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off.\\" which are 9 tracks off of the cd..to love that many off of an album says something. Usually I really only like about 5 fro ma given cd, but this cd presents a lot of great material. ANd it is their most radio-unfriendly cd to date, and yet it is awesome. <br />I highly recomend it
B000002MJC|5.0|I tend to find that the people who don't like \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" are in two categories: Electronic purists who are so set in their ways that DM doing a guitar based album is a travesty (although hints started with \\"Black Celebration\\"), people wrongfully accusing it as an attempt to stay relevant (followed \\"Violator\\" and most of these are songs that Pearl Jam and the likes never have & never will make). But beyond that, there isn't one single bad song on \\"SoFaD.\\" It may take awhile to digest it though, I'll admit. It took awhile for me to get used to the \\"noir-gospel\\" of \\"Condemnation,\\" but I now really love that song. The lyrics are not really embarassing, and \\"I Feel You\\" is one of Depeche Mode's greatest songs ever (that says a lot!). Another classic is the six-and-a-half minute \\"In Your Room.\\" Martin Gore sings on a couple of slower-toned, orchestral tracks like the dark yet beautiful \\"Judas\\" and string-heavy \\"One Caress.\\" Sure, the single version of \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" is better than the one on here, but that doesn't make this \\"not worth owning.\\" Not only this, every song still sounds like Depeche Mode. The songs I didn't mention are still wonderful too, and I particularly like the punch of \\"Get Right with Me\\" and the pseudo-industrial \\"Rush.\\" Gore is usually great when he writes the type of dark lyrics on this album, part of its greatness. <br /> <br />In short: It's worth owning because it's a wonderful band at a creative peak, it's cheap, and even if the cover art is lackluster the music will help you overlook that (but I think that's why some people presumptively dismiss & mock the album). Hey, the first two albums have my favorite cover art and are my least favorites that the group did.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|So many HD DVDs contain only what was on the original DVD in the way of extras, but not this one. Together with a high quality HD DVD transfer, the disc held other significant extras including a second film `The Invisible Boy' and a  TV show, together with other high lights of Robby the Robert appearances. In a word, hours and hours of quality additions.
B000001FA4|3.0|Okay, I'll admit one thing: This album has some really great tracks. \\"Pride\\" in particular is totally classic, one of their greatest even now. Its arena rock stab works well with a really big sound and good message. Other highlights are in \\"Wire\\" and \\"Indian Summer Sky.\\" The title track is actually kind of memorable and is well made musically. It is not really their most well-aged either. I prefer \\"War\\" and \\"Actung Baby\\" by miles, even the debut \\"Boy\\" to this. The songs aren't that bad but they just aren't that interesting. In spite having one of the greatest U2 songs ever, this is just an album to me, nothing more & nothing less.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|The Beatles LOVE works well in only a few spots. The highlight for me is George Harrison's demo of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" The strings added to it are quite lovely and appropriate.<br /><br />The rest of this album just hasn't worn as well with me. After only five plays I find most of it simply irritating. Admittedly, a few tracks are clever amalgams of two or more songs, however, others are drastically clumsy botches. Finally, there are some songs here that sound as if they've hardly been tampered with at all. The overall effect of the whole set is a feeling of disorientation. Perhaps as background to a stage show LOVE works fine; without those visuals it falls quite flat.<br /><br />This would NOT be the ideal choice for introducing the uninitiated to the music of the Beatles. At times the mixes border on confusing noise-- and I cannot believe I'm saying this about *the* favorite band of my youth. The Beatles-- noise? No way.......way, sadly.<br /><br />This collection is overwhelming proof that great art should never be altered or toyed with-- its beauty can be too easily destroyed.
B000IHY9SE|3.0|It definitely doesn't sound like an album, then again, with so many artists, it's probably for the best. The production is on point, the lyrics are on point, but it does feel more like a display of talent and bravado rather than a cohesive project.<br /><br />Close your eyes, and half of the tracks sound like a typical NY mixtape, which is not a bad look, considering the recent revival of the NY mixtape circuit.<br /><br />\\"No Apologies\\" will please all the em fans, \\"We Ride for Shady\\" is a tight joint, and overall, the Re-Up is a well produced mixtape, and I wouldn't be surprised if Alchemist played a hand in it, his signature sound is all over the place.
B00005JPAF|5.0|Overall this is a great movie.  It has all one would expect from Scorsese and the top name stars.  Great performances be all. <br /> <br />Reading the reviews by critics a few criticized Nicholson for his performance, being his usual Jack Nicholson self.  When one hires Nicholson one should know what to expect.  Scorsese know what he would get, it is most likely what he wanted and that is why he picked Nicholson for the part. <br /> <br />Getting to the two things that are wrong with this movie: Alec Baldwin and the ending. <br /> <br />Alec Baldwin is not the actor he used to be.  His acting as suffered and he is no longer the \\"A\\" list star headliner of movies.  Maybe it is because he could never really act, or maybe, as I think, he has become so full of himself and he inserts his poiltics into his acting, which adversly affects his acting.  Which leads to the stupidest thing in the movie.  Where Baldwin breaks character and screams (paraphased) \\" I love the Patriot Act\\".  A real cop in that position would not do that. <br /> <br />The second thing wrong with this movie is the ending.  Or perhaps it is the/an event leading to the ending that is wrong.  If DiCaprio had exited the elevator the way he entered, with extreme caution, I expect that things would have been different.  Scorsese should have worked out a better scenerio to get to the ending that he wanted. <br /> <br />And what is with this second mole in the Police Depart. coming out of nowhere?
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World is a book about the history of philosophy. It is through the eyes of a fourteen year old girl named Sophie Amundsen, who is the main character of the book. She has had a perfectly normal life until one day she gets a mysterious letter from a complete stranger. He becomes Sophie's philosophy teacher. His name is Alberto Knox. Throughout the book, Alberto writes letters to Sophie. Each day, Sophie has her philosophy course through the letters that he writes to her. Sophie sometimes dozes off into her own world where she only thinks about philosophy and where the world came from. Sophie's deep interest in philosophy and history makes her friendship with her friend, Joanna, fall apart, and also make her mom think that she is on drugs. In my opinion, Sophie is a wonderful, bright girl who has a brilliant mind and a logical way of thinking. <br /> Part of this book is about the science of philosophy, and another part is the history of philosophy. While I read the science part of the book, it was a review for me, because I had already learned the material in biology. When I read the history of philosophy, it got me really interested. I especially liked when Alberto was talking about the myths that people believed in long ago. There was a myth that I really enjoyed reading. It was about a god named Thor and his hammer. Thor was a god of fertility, and he controlled the weather with his hammer. For instance, if he was swinging his hammer, that meant he was bringing rain on earth. It was interesting to see how people long ago believed how the world worked around them. <br /> I didn't like how the book had big amounts of science information at once, because those parts were not so interesting to me. It felt like I was reading a science textbook instead of a novel. Other than that, the book is very interesting and exciting. If you don't know anything about philosophy, and you want to learn it in an enjoyable and exciting way, this is the book for you. <br />
B000006E4C|5.0|This recording is a perfect example of how Reich has influenced instrumental/classical music. Its seems as if every movie released in the last ten years has soundtrack recordings that try to imitate Reich, like the movie American Beauty. While people buy these soundtrack recordings, they often do not even know who Steve Reich is or where there imitation music came from. This is one of the best recordings for anyone knew to this music, and should not be considered as minimalist. I agree with Philip Glass, who believes the word minimalist is not an adequate term.<br /><br />The term minimalist seems to indicate simplicity or shallowness, but this music is neither. This is in fact very deep and moving music, full of emotion and dynamic ideas.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|Rocky Balboa is a local guy who is just going through life making ends meet. He boxes at underground clubs for extra cash.  He breaks legs for a local bookie on the side.  He trains at a gym, but only does so halfheartedly--to the point where the owner of the gym gives his locker away because of his lack of focus. He has a crush on his best friend's sister, a girl named Adrianne who works at a pet shop. All in all, Rocky is just another guy trying to make it in 1975 Philadelphia.<br /><br />When the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, has problems finding someone to fight at a holiday spectacle he's planning on New Year's Day, he decides to give a local guy a shot at the title. He chooses Rocky not for his skill, but because he's known as the Italian Stallion. Apollo thinks beating this hometown boy will let people know that he is the American Dream.<br /><br />Rocky is the quintessential American hero.  This is the greatest underdog sports movie and the one that paved the way for all the ones to follow.  This rerelease in a two-disc collector's edition is long overdue.  Some have problems because the film has been released so times, but with Rocky Balboa hitting theaters this winter it was pretty much a given that they would rerelease this film.<br /><br />The extras:<br /><br />About the best thing in this collector's edition (in my opinion) is the inclusion of three sets of audio commentaries.  The one with Sylvester Stallone is, in itself, worth the $20 price tag.  Since Stallone wrote the movie as well as starred in it, he has some interesting perspectives and his reflection on the project 30 years later will be a big draw for longtime fans of the film.  The \\"making of\\" featurette on the second disc is lengthy, so be prepared for all the info it contains. It comes in three parts and I watched them separately since they contain over an hour's worth of extra info.  Finally, the booklet that comes with this set is an excerpt from an upcoming book called Rocky: The Ultimate Guide.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this DVD set for fans of the movie, and anyone who loves underdog sports movies. Rocky's whole life was a million-to-one shot and watching this movie will be uplifting and inspirational for anyone who has ever been down on their luck.alled Rocky: The Ultimate Guide. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this DVD set for fans of the movie, and anyone who loves underdog sports movies.

B00007K02F|4.0|Everything about this movie appears to be correct. Jane is neither beautiful nor old. Rochester is not at all but hansome but has a pleasant air to him. The story line is somewhat altered from the original Bronte novel but none the less it tells the story of love between two lonley and hurt people.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|This movie really depressed me.  Even though I am sure there are families very similar to the family portrayed in Little Miss Sunshine...  I honestly thought it might be more like the old Shirley Temple movies.  I guess they just don't make movies like that anymore.  I would much rather see Shirley Temple tap her way down the stair case with Bo Jangles... If you don't want to know the ending stop reading now...  In the end, the grandfather turns out to be a dirty old man that teaches his granddaughter how to strip for her talent in the Little Miss Sunshine pagent. He dies, and they cart him around in the back of their broken down van.  If you have been sexually abused or mistreated as a child, or know someone who has been, or just a concerned parent or adult, I think you will take great offense at this movie.  Women and girls have been exploited enough, without it warrenting some disfunctanal approval, just because it was rated R.  It only shows what a sad state this world is coming to, when this type of movie is even made and nominated... if it was meant to depress people and to prove that children aren't safe with grandpa or dirty old mean, it accomplished it. Grandpa isn't teaching your child to fish, play T Ball, tie their shoes, learn the names of the Presidents, States and Capitals, or even how to count out change, balance a check book, or to keep your elbows off the table and chew with your mouth close...  he's teaching your little girl how to strip.  this rates a five star ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh...
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I cannot count the times I have listened to this wonderful album. It is a genuine Christmas album with a great combination of traditional hymns and secular songs. If you want the traditional fair with notes and keys that are predictable... then by all means go with something else. Sarah fans will appreciate her gorgeous renditions and beautiful voice. Every person I have played this album for has loved it. I am so happy I bought Wintersong... what a find!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|This is great memories of a time really not so far away. The stories are just as relevant and it's just very enjoyable to watch the eppy's all over again. I'm 51 and enjoying seeing BH90210 again! Here's hoping it doesn't take forever to get to the other seasons. I'm STILL waiting on Season's 2 of Knots Landing and Dynasty.
0375831002|5.0|This book was written in a very different style but once I got use to it, I loved it.  Death as a story teller was great and it was nice to see it in a different light.  You really get to know the characters and they become your friends.  Although it is not my useral type of book, this is a wonderful book. I would highly recommend it.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I went into this movie knowing that it wouldn't be as good as the original.  I knew that the actors (besides Spacey) couldn't pull off the amazing chemistry that the original cast had.  However, this terrible sloppy, disappointing, boring attempt at a film was by all standards terrible.  The plot line is underdeveloped, the impact of Superman's character slight, and Kate Bonsworth did such a horrible and dreary job of playing Lois you would swear that they picked the worst actress they could find.  I was appalled whenever I heard the original music from Superman being played in this hideous unrecognizable rip off of a genius film we grew to love.      First of all, why would Lois purposely take her son to Lex's layer, where she knows danger could be?  Second, what happened to the great flood that was supposed to cover the US?  Third, who in the world would want to live on that island which was no more than a giant rocky mountain with no vegetation to support life?  Senseless faulty plotline with too many holes.  There was no chemistry between any of the characters.  I am mystified at the fact that some people actually liked this film; it was terrible in everyway!     The storyline, acting, and dialog was weak in every way possible.  I could not believe my eyes as the credits rolled that this film made it to the big screen.  At the least I was expecting some good action scenes and amazing effects but there was barely even any of those.  This was the worst super hero movie since the Hulk, and honestly, I think it comes close to being even worse than that.  It was absolutely grotesque.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|After all the years of hype and vitriolic reviews from people like Ebert, I finally decided to watch the thing, so I bought this Millennium edition DVD. I did it differently than most: I watched the Joe Bob Briggs commentary first. (It's confusing to find; it's on the menu under \\"audio setup\\"). <br />Briggs's commentary is humorous, insightful, and at times, brilliant. I really had the feeling that I was watching the film along with him, which was very comforting during the more disturbing scenes, and entertaining during some of the more boring ones. I don't generally go for these types of films, but I think Briggs is an excellent commentator and critic.  <br /> <br />Most significantly, Briggs doesn't defend the film as some kind of high art. He objectively points out its shortcomings, but also its virtues--many of which would not have been apparent to me if I had simply watched the film without the commentary. <br /> <br />The other commentary, by director Meir Zarchi, includes his real-life story of helping a female who had been raped and beaten and how the experience inspired him to make the film. It sounds very altruistic, and I have no doubt that the man is sincere.  <br />The question is: Is this a credible piece of filmmaking?  <br /> <br />I would say that it's a flawed film in some ways and a fearless and groundbreaking film in other ways.  <br />If you are focusing more on the formalistic aspects of filmmaking, you will find some surprisingly good scenes and camera work, but other scenes linger too long and could have used some editing. <br /> <br />Acting-wise, Camille Keaton knocks herself out in this film. Briggs observes that the entire film is \\"external\\"; there is virtually no insight into the minds of the characters--it's almost like watching a documentary, it's so dispassionate and objective. That makes her job all the more difficult.  <br /> <br />As to the content: Briggs comments intelligently on the feminist aspect. The film is shot, as he clearly demonstrates, from the female's point of view, and it in no way glorifies rape or makes any attempt to portray it as something erotic. Indeed, it made me flinch and turn away several times.  <br /> <br />From a feminist standpoint, there is a lot of meaningful symbolism here. The revenge scenes are every bit as appalling as the rape scenes, but I have to admit that I was glad to see the bad guys get their comeuppance.  <br />In other words, I became emotionally involved in the story. Hmmmm.....isn't that the mark of a credible film? <br /> <br />It may not be great cinema, but I don't the film deserves the near-unanimous dismissal as a piece of exploitative trash that it has been given by the critics. I think Zarchi was making a point about male domination of females, and he wanted to make it as graphic as possible.  <br /> <br />Man have argued that this film is just gratuitous sensatonalism. Well, maybe it is, in many aspects; directors want their films to make money, and they will go to any length to get attention. Yet somehow, this film  makes a socio-sexual point that's worth considering. <br /> <br />This is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. I don't think being disturbed is a legitimate reason to watch a film. I'm not recommending it; I'm just saying that it does what it intends.
B000002J6H|5.0|<br />I too am a tad thrown by the Editorial Review. The fact that Stills wrote  <br />Suite: Judy Blues Eyes - in itself - is remarkable. Just that one song, <br />let alone all the rest.  <br /> <br />I can think of many great and wonderfully talented musicians in this <br />world and Stephen Stills is certainly among the best of them. <br /> <br />As much as I love Neil Young - I would say that Stills is the most <br />significant of the bunch. <br />
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I don't understand why people cry about it not being full length songs or that they are butchered. It's a compilation! It's supposed to be something new and different other than the same exact songs we've been hearing for 40 years! Live a little people. It's a good CD to have IN ADDITION TO the other regular Beatles collection. can't wait to see the show in Vegas.
630218021X|5.0|is this film not on DVD?  And, for the record, what about The Devils?  Ken Russell was the most courageous and daring film-maker of his or any generation. His films were, and still are, waaay ahead of their time.  There's no way anyone would touch that subject matter today.  In an industry filled with formulaic scripts and passionless, bland, Winona Ryder-esque acting, his films were the jewel in the crown, the needle in the haystack.  We desperately need more writers/directors/producers with his uncompromising vision and storytelling talent.
B0007ORU66|4.0|I got this mostly as a collection item since it is a Russian bootleg more or less. Why won't Capitol Records officially release this already?
B00004HYLF|5.0|Nothing like a great drummer to put down great groves.To me he is the stand out.I'm a person who loves guitar and bass and most of all drums.If you understand drums you would know these licks are very off time and very technical.Stanley Clarke is a great bass player i know his tone right away same with al diemola.Anyway if you like jazz rock(fusion)and drumming get this album.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I'll be honest.  I wasn't planning on buying this album.  I'm a huge No Doubt fan and was very disappointed by L.A.M.B...not because I was expecting a No Doubt sound, but because I was expecting a catchy pop album, which, despite some big hits, L.A.M.B was not.  So I really wasn't going to waste my money on this album.  BUT THEN, I listened to a preview online and though I wasn't terribly enthused, a day later I couldn't get some of the songs out of my head.  So finally I caved and bought the CD and so far I'm really happy I did.  Unlike L.A.M.B this CD is really addicting and fun to listen to.  Tracks 1-7 are all pretty solid, but the album loses momentum with tracks 8-10 and only picks it up again at the end of the disc.<br /><br />There aren't the highs or the lows of L.A.M.B in the Sweet Escape, but it is a more consistent album.  There are some songs that sound rather generic or like rehashed songs from the later, and less popular, parts of L.A.M.B, but overall The Sweet Escape is a catchy pop album that has me as addicted, something no album has done for me in a long time.  Considering some of the extremely negative reviews, I was pretty suprised how fun this album actually is.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|After completely going mental for L.A.M.B. and loving almost every single track, perhaps my expectations were a little too high for the follow-up.   But I really just have to say Gwen's follow up disappoints completely!!!    The songs are un-melodic, un-interesting, and just plain BAD!!!   It's hip-hop meets Lite-FM!   \\"Wind it Up\\" is the best song on the album, which isn't saying much.  The Neptunes clearly phoned this one in.   Maybe this project was rushed a little bit.    <br /> <br />It's sad when Fergie out-Gwens Gwen!!
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah Carey possesses great talent; Amazon correctly notes that she has a multi-octave singing range. On this CD Mariah delivers one great performance after another with every song she sings. Her voice is rich, vibrant and full of energy. She doesn't need to prove herself because she is known to have great talent; but her vocal gymnastics on this album highlight her talents yet again. This CD proves it.<br /><br />The CD starts out with the beautiful traditional song entitled \\"Silent Night.\\" Mariah performs this flawlessly; and she is ably assisted by a wonderful choir and a sensitive musical arrangement. The CD then takes a quick turn to a more secular, pop music flavored ballad entitled \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You.\\" The mixing is superb and the choir supports Mariah well. The beat is excellent and \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" deserves recognition as an instant Christmastime classic.<br /><br />Other religious songs on this album include \\"O Holy Night;\\" \\"Jesus Born On This Day;\\" \\"Hark! The Angels Sing/Gloria (In Excelsis Deo)\\" and the gospel ballad \\"Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child.\\" All of these songs are done to perfection. The gospel song \\"Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child\\" is an excellent choice to end this album as it has a strong, catchy beat and the message is appropriately religious. Moreover, the gospel choir on this last track is positively electric.<br /><br />The album boasts two more love ballads: \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" expresses a woman's longing for a lost love especially during the holiday season. \\"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\\" deals with the same issue but expresses even more melancholy with Mariah's incredible voice and its flawless musical arrangement. Excellent!<br /><br />The liner notes are excellent. The songs credits and lyrics are there for you; and there are numerous beautiful photos of Mariah and a man dressed up as Santa Claus. Very sweet!<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD for fans of both secular and religious Christmastime music. Mariah's fans will never get enough of this terrific CD not just because it's Mariah singing but also for the several musical arrangements Mariah personally did for this album. Fans of R&B/Soul Christmas music will also be delighted!ar and religious Christmastime music. Mariah's fans will never get enough of this terrific CD not just because it's Mariah singing but also for the several musical arrangements Mariah personally did for this album.

B000I0QK74|5.0|What a beautiful CD by one of the most beautiful voices....
0618680004|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone willing to look at themselves and their beliefs. I cannot remember reading a more thought provoking book; the well-reasoned arguments have changed my mind on several issues.  Dawkins lost me in the last two chapters where I think he overstates his case but note that I said \\"I think\\", that is what this book makes you do.  The God Delusion is generally well written and I would give it five stars if only Dawkins had omitted the many instances of sarcasm and a few horrible phrases such as \\"pushing the envelope of evil into uncharted territory\\".  If you read this book and find yourself agreeing with most of it I suggest reading the reviews on this site that have no stars: they are very funny.
B0002O06N0|5.0|Hello World,<br /><br />  I seen the cover and the images in the CD case and thought this should be a total dump!!! These two guys look like they design pocket protectors! Man, was I wrong. Totally wrong! Singer/guitarist sounds like a real down an out 40 year old delta bluesman and the drummer redifines high hat work. All from Ohio for Gods sake, I never would have believed it myself. Very blues but very fresh blues, yes? Sooooo smooth. The only good thing from the movie Rest Stop was the discovery of this band. \\"Keep me clean, keep me warm, keep my soul away from harm.\\" Rock on world!!!
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Mark Knopfer (of Dire Straits fame) and Emmylou Harris join forces on this album but is this a real collaboration and team effort, or another Mark Mark Knopfler solo album which features Emmylou Harris?<br /><br />\\"All the Roadrunning\\" (12 tracks, 50 min.) features 10 Kopfler-penned songs, and 2 Harris-penned tracks. The first 4 songs, including the very nice opener \\"Bearchcombing\\", feature Kopfler far too much. Emmylou barely gets a word in, so to speak. Things are much better from there on, including \\"Rolling On\\" and the Harris songs \\"Love and Happiness\\" and \\"Belle Star\\" (\\"I'll be your Belle Starr/You can be my Jesse James\\"). Also quite good is the title track (which, incidentally already had appeared on 2005's \\"Private Investigations: The Very Best of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits\\") and the closer \\"If This Is Goodbye\\".<br /><br />\\"All the Roadrunning\\" is by all means not a bad album, yet I can't help but be a bit disappointed. Not only is Emmilou Harris not on even footing with Mark Knopfler (perhaps not surprisingly as Knopfler wrote all but 2 of the songs), but probably I am a victim of my own expectations for this album, which were admittedly sky-high. (A few weeks ago, the live CD/DVD combo \\"Real Live Roadrunning\\" was released.)

B000J103X4|5.0|I bought the cd tonight not knowing much about him... I saw his video on BET and thought he dropped tracks like the sh-t... I will be honest I don't like a lot of the rap that is out today. I listen to like bone thugs, 3 /6 mafia and spice 1 and too short... But as far as new rap I haven't found any that is hard core like I like my rap... I feel If your going to say it then lay it down and don't play with my head. giving me the sh-t!!!!... So I popped this cd in and I swear to God every track on this cd is solid gold... like clocken dollars this is a gold album and as far as \\"THE GAME\\" WHEN I FIND A GOOD RAPPER I \\"T\\" TOTALLY SUPPORT THEM AND BUY ALL THEIR ALBUMS... But it is rare that my style of rap is played in the main stream... Because the fact is if it's real hard core rap than you don't hear much about them, like spice one and a few others.... So I am wrapping this up and I gotta say the best tracks are 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,14 It is rare you find an ablum that the whole thing is something you can play all the way through and not skip a track!!!!!
B000F3A7LE|5.0|What a great compilation! I had read some complaints about the earlier '83 release being remixed and have stuck with the vinyl until now. These discs have the best of all worlds:<br /><br />'79 original tapes brightened up a bit, but interestingly, not as sonically open as the '83 remix<br />'83 remix version, which has some negatively noticable differences from the '79 edition:<br /> - \\"Exposure\\" remix mutes the rythm section and excises Terry Roche's exclaimation \\"Hah!\\" from the end of the song. I guess Robert didn't like the implied triumph over Suffering : )<br /> - \\"Chicago\\" has a slightly different vocal take and (again) muted rythm<br /> - \\"Breathless\\" alters the Frippertronics and (noticing a trend?) mutes the rythm section. I know RF has long running battles with Rythm musicians, but in these cases I found that less was not more.<br /><br />All in all, only a few of the songs were \\"improved\\" enough for me to prefer the clearer sound of the '83 remix. Beautiful songs that begged for little improvement: \\"Mary\\" with a slightly different vocal ending and \\"Northstar\\" are stellar and the umpteenth version of Gabriel's \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" has some of the Frippertronics replaced by a flute and is the best version of the song I've heard.<br /><br />The 3rd component of this Exposure release is the inclusion of Daryl Hall's original vocals on several songs and a couple of other unmemorable alternate vocal takes by other artists. Hall's take on the song \\"Exposure\\" pales in comparison to the looped vocals of the Roche who must have had to have had vocal chord surgery afterwards, and while very good, his version of \\"Mary\\" is not quite up to Roche's version. Despite Fripp's angst at Hall's management that denied inclusion of these songs in the '79 release, we can all be thrilled at the resulting brilliance of his choice of Roche as the replacement vocalist for the aforementioned songs.<br /><br />Finally, there is a fun little booklet with another of Fripp's trademark rants against the horrible state of the music world versus the nirvana that Music 'done the right way' can provide. It's pretty touching, actually, and reminds me a bit of Zappa's heartfelt take that \\"Music is the Best\\".<br /><br />Anyway, if you're at all curious about various forms of music, you'll find quite a few styles represented here all delivered with Fripp's characteristic intensity:  powerful, beautiful, tender, haunting, hypnotic, chaotic, paranoic, angry music done right!orld versus the nirvana that Music 'done the right way' can provide.

0694013889|2.0|It's great that little girls who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.   <br /> <br />I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls. Maybe the chamber pot style toilets in the book actually exist in a spanish speaking country somewhere...maybe....
B000HBK3MM|5.0|When I first saw this artist, and I say first saw, I was not attracted to her style of music. I think it was the look and the song. It sounded like she was just barley singing. I then heard \\"Like a star\\" and it kept sticking with me. And I must say I LOVE THE ALBUM.  I became curious after I heard \\"Like a star\\" and I was hooked. I have it on my mp3, work radio and home. Did I also mention my car! I am an ecleptic for music and I think the wrong song came out first, but she is a breakout artist with Like a star! <br />meilahnie
B000GG4KTU|2.0|There's not a song on this CD that someone hasn't done better. As a standards singer, I rate Krall a 6. However, for her efforts on Girl in the Other Room plus her duets with Ray Charles (You Don't Know Me) and Willie Nelson (Crazy) I give her a 10. She apparently has traded in her newfound specialness and uniqueness for a return to what her old fans demand: mediocrity.
B000268QB2|5.0|As soon as I saw the video for \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" I was intrigued. This video had the woods turning to buildings, reminding me of my hometown, only unlike the video, the buildings in my town won't turn back to woods. This song has a lot of personal meaning for me and I really love the lines \\"I came across a fallen tree...I felt the branches of it looking at me...\\" <br />I have gotten into very few bands of this decade. Keane is one of those few bands. They use piano instead of guitar, which gives them a more \\"classy\\" feel (even though I like guitar too) and when I hear melodic piano I think of my favorite English band, Renaissance. There are a lot of singers who don't know how to sing, but I love the singer for Keane. He has a beautiful voice, is very soulful and at times reminds me of Freddie Mercury of Queen.  <br />I don't think I can list each individual song, because this is one of those albums that doesn't contain a bad song. (Maybe the 3rd to last, with \\"can anybody find their own?\\" is my least favorite?) Basically this album is a pop album, but like the Smiths, they put intelligence and emotion into the pop style. I even think it has a little bit of a \\"teenage\\" feel, but not in a phony angsty way, more like someone who is growing up and learning and questioning things. Their music is very thoughtful and you don't need to be an adolescent to appreciate it. <br />Under the Iron Sea is just as great an album- Keane is an excellent band so far!
B000BTC5LW|3.0|I've been a Floyd fan for decades. \\"Ummagumma\\" was one of my first music purchases. I've only seen them once, touring DSOM, but have an embarrassing number of bootleg recordings. I'm saying all of this so that you, the reader, will take my review seriously. I purchased \\"Pulse\\" when it came out on VHS and was somewhat satisfied. It was an amazing film to watch. The visuals and the stage were mesmerizing. However, I just felt as if the performances were sterile. Where was the spontaneity? Had they become so dependant upon their light show that musical course changes were now out of the question? Had the \\"artistic Floyd\\" had given way to the \\"Floyd industry.\\" (\\"Welcome To The Machine\\" turned against itself?)  I was left with the feeling that those responsible were trotting out \\"the hits\\" so as to tap the financial well just one more time. They got my money and I don't regret it. Too much. I've watched it twice, maybe three times, but haven't felt in the mood to watch it again in quite some time. Well, as all good lemmings do, I purchased the DVD version. I was hoping for two things: a more permanent format than tape and some extras such as another song or interviews with the three principal band members. I'm sorry, but \\"one out of two\\" doesn't sit right with me and, thusly, I present this latest incarnation of Pink Floyd with only 3 stars. I expected more from them, even without Roger Waters. A poorly shot video of a bunch of roadies and an even more poorly shot \\"bootleg\\" videos cannot mollify the disappointment I now feel about parting with perfectly good money. And remember folks, money is only of value when it is spent. If you own the VHS, do not buy the DVD. There is no added value.
B000005J56|5.0|This album is a gem. Very vibrant stuff, to the musicians, thank you for having this passion. I thought i heard an out of tune guitar string here, and there, but nothing that would change the outcome.
B000005JH5|5.0|I recently read that Kate Bush's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" was not initially inspired by the actual book but by a television mini-series based on same (not even the classic Laurence Olivier/Merle Oberon film apparently).  My initial reaction was one of shock.  I mean, Kate must have been all of 15 or 16 when she conceived of the song, but haven't all well-bred (and reasonably well-read) young English girls read the Bronte classic by then?  And wasn't it just the height of presumption to pen a three minute musical adaptation of that narrative without having digested the actual book itself?  Well, that's the librarian in me speaking, I guess.  The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea that Kate's classic (some might say \\"signature\\" song) was based on a screenplay rather than its source novel. <br /> <br />First of all, Kate supposedly read the novel right after having composed the song, in order to verify that her \\"research\\" was right.  So all is forgiven on that score.  Secondly, it seems all the more emblematic of her teenage creative soul that she would take her inspiration where she found it--even if it's not necessarily through the accepted channels.  And then, just the fact that she apparently admitted it without much reservation is charmingly candid.  <br /> <br />And of course it is a great song--one of many on this, Kate Bush's astonishing debut album.  And I am not one to use words like \\"astonishing\\" lightly.  To think that this almost flawless, truly poetic and musically sophisticated record was the work of a 19 year old almost boggles the mind.  And one considers that many of the tracks were actually written when Kate was an even younger teen, well, it's clear that we are dealing with a true prodigy. <br /> <br />In terms of her adolescent burst of creative energy, Kate Bush reminds me of no one so much as Laura Nyro.  Like Nyro, her songs were both quirky and yet eminently listenable. They were,in fact, full of hooks.  Both women simultaneously enjoyed \\"cult\\" status while proving to be \\"commercially viable,\\" (Nyro, unfortunately, primarily in the role of  a hit factory for OTHER artists--even though her own interpretations were invariabley superior;  Bush enjoyed considerable popularity on her home turf, but had to wait years to achieve any prominence in the US).  Despite wildly divergent influences (Laura being steeped in NYC Doo-Wop, R&B, Broadway, and--really just--a bit of folk; while Kate was rooted in an Anglo-Celtic folk tradition, melded with a particularly British brand of progressive rock),  they were in so many ways, sisters under the skin.  Kate Nyro?  Laura Bush? (Strike that last.) <br /> <br />If you accept that premise, then you might also agree with me that Kate Bush's early work displays the same kind of \\"madcap energy\\" that Laura saw in her own early work.  Her songs were wildly inventive, musically and lyrically.  Her off-handed spirituality galled some critics, but others found her bandying about of names like Gurdjieff and Jesus in the context of a bouncy, spirited near novelty number (\\"Them Heavy People\\") completely winning.  A similar spirit sends a song like \\"Kite\\" aloft.  And keeps it there. <br /> <br />The slower tempoed tunes are equally captivating, many of them moody meditations on love and loss that should have been beyond her years (as, say, Nyro had been a decade or so before with tunes like \\"December's Boudoir').  One can allow a 19-year old her Romanticism, so when she sees herself \\"in a Berlin bar, in a corner brooding,\\" the listener indulges her her fantasy.  Everyone's entitled to what Joni Mitchell calls their \\"dark cafe days.\\"  And at least, the young Kate Bush spent her time there sincerely grooving to a genius player's saxophone.  And the sax arrangement captures that sentiment beautifully. <br /> <br />And speaking of arrangements, KICK INSIDE does differ from any number of other promising debut albums in one significant regard:  the production and arrangements arespot on.  They complement Kate's material beautifully.  Kate did not start producing her own material for another few years, but she either lucked out and had the most compatible producer and arrangers possible or she was already--at the age of 19--calling the shots behind the scenes.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005N5S5|1.0|I just receive my copy and what a surprise ! <br /> <br />The only extra on this DVD is THE TERMINATOR trailer !
B00005JPGM|4.0|This movie is like Hotel Rwanda meets Titanic: It offers a vivid and stomach wrenching portrayal of a modern human atrocity with a classic hollywood story smothered on top of it. The film is set in the civil war and chaos of 1990's Sierra Leone, but it could have been any number of recent conflicts.  The film depicts the true meaning of the terms \\"indiscriminate violence\\" and \\"rape and pillage,\\" and places a spotlight on the reprehensible ways children can be transformed into merciless killing machines through appalling brutality.  <br /> <br />The film also offers a thinly veiled indictment of the De Beers Group by answering a question that most grooms-to-be probably don't want to ask: How does money spent on diamonds translate into fuel for warfare? The acting by DiCaprio, Connelly, Hounsou, and a large supporting cast is fine, but it seems the film makers felt the need to sugarcoat the bitter truth they document with a classic action movie plot line. Be prepared for one-dimensional characters, plenty of clichéd dialogue, and a sappy hollywood ending.  The end result is a truly violent film that is worth seeing if you have the stomach for it, but that I couldn't help but think could have been better.
B000F8O35U|5.0|\\"The Little Mermaid\\" ushered in a rebirth of the animated musical which had been in a steady decline since even before Walt Disney's death in 1966. This was the film that the floundering Disney animation department had to prove themselves with... sink or swim quite literally.  <br /> <br />And the movie is a beauty! Inspired animation by greats like Ruben Aquino, Andreas Deja, and the legendary Glen Keane (who is directing the upcoming \\"Rapunzel\\"). The effects are stunning including a riveting storm sequence comparable to the Monstro scene in \\"Pinocchio\\" and the final sequence with the towering Ursula as queen of the seas. Sure its formulaic now, but the musical scenes are timeless and though \\"Under the Sea\\" is not as sophisticated as later animated \\"showstoppers\\" it still makes you see why the film's first audiences described wanting to stand up and cheer after the sequence.  <br /> <br />If you're any kind of animation buff (and even if you're not), the DVD's bonus features are great. The \\"Making of\\" featurette is quite thorough and takes you through the whole filmmaking process from the director's initial pitch to the studio bringing in Howard Ashman who fleshed out the characters with his witty lyrics to the final tense moments leading up to the premier in 1989. There's some great suprises here including interviews with John Waters (over Ursula being modeled on drag queen legend, Divine), and ex-Disney exec Jeffrey Katzenberg who stepped away from Dreamworks long enough to bring his insight on making \\"Mermaid\\" (and who, we find out almost nixed Ariel's anthem \\"Part of Your World\\" from the film). <br /> <br />This film is inspiring to any wanna-be animator out there. Even more so, its a great film. I only hope the current studio brass takes note that films like this are priceless unlike the uninspired sequels they've been throwing at us for the past few years. <br /> <br />Viva la Mermaid!
B000024D4R|5.0|Dogs: if this music doesn't raise the hairs on your neck, best see if your head's still attached. It's one of the more moving, shattering songs that PF created over the course of their decade of creative maturity. Waters' metaphor is savagely poignant: the corporate hound, in a career of backstabbing, life-sucking, money-hungry depredation, finds that his blood has congealed--calcified with the weight of his accumulated crimes--and it drags him down to inner death, drowns him in the pool of his own deceit and ignominy. Gilmour, too, is at his heart-stopping, inspiring best on this track, in which he combines acoustic and electric sequences in music that raises Waters' verse to a level of sublimity that is rarely touched in modern music.<br /><br />There are other amazing discoveries to be made in the other tracks of this album: Gilmour performs further wonders in his solos on Pigs and Sheep, and even the tiny snippets that open and close the album (Pigs on the Wing) are moving in their irony--parodies of the top-40 love songs that were (and are) the radio rage while PF continued their practice of creating long, carefully constructed pieces of music that could be explored rather than merely enjoyed.<br /><br />Animals, on the whole, is perhaps the last great collaboration of these outstanding artists (and I include Wright and Mason there, whose contributions throughout the PF era have been generally underestimated). True, there is some great music on The Wall, but by that time Waters and his runaway ego had taken over the band, and it was no more the seamless unit that changed the history of music with DSOTM, WYWH, and Animals.<br /><br />The only element I miss on this album is Dick Parry, the saxophonist whose sound had become so central to the PF aura in Dark Side and Wish You Were Here. Yet even without him, Animals is one of the high points in the entire history of modern music.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|What an eye opener! Al Gore presents scientific data with a truly staggering affect. It is clear to see the path that we all must take.  I highly encourage anyone to sit in complete surrender to the inevitable understanding that will take place inside you once you view the insurmountable evidence. <br /> <br />I pledge to re-think my life and save this planet for the children. Watch (3rd open) and share with EVERYONE you know as we are the perpetrators and the avengers - it is time to wake up the power we all carry inside of each of us to make a difference!   <br /> <br />
B000IHY9SE|4.0|In Dec. 2006, Eminem released \\"The Re-Up,\\" a collection of songs from his Shady Records roster. Those included are fan favorites Em, 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, D12 and Obie Trice. In addition, Em introduces the world to Stat Quo, Ca$his and Bobby Creekwater. \\"No Apologies,\\" is by far the best track on the album and just happens to be a song by Em himself. But don't let that think others don't shine. This album has solified my decision to buy the debut from Stat Quo, titled \\"Statlanta,\\" when it is released in 2007. Ca$his has a good flow, but I'm not yet sold on him and Bobby Creek just yet. If you're looking for some new Eminem, you will get it here. He shows up on 7 tracks and they are all good. The album is a good collection of remixes and the Shady camp. Look out for Dr. Dre's \\"Detox,\\" Stat Quo's \\"Statlanta,\\" and Eminem's new album, reportedly a double album next year.
B000H7JD4K|2.0|Really not even close to all the hype, with the average review saying that it's \\"the closest thing to Seventh Son...\\"  After hearing the new album a couple times through, that statement is truly laughable.  <br /> <br />Granted, it is a huge step up in quality from Dance Of Death, Maiden's worse release ever, even more horrible than the universally panned Virtual 11.  At least that one had better than average tracks like \\"Futureal\\" and \\"The Clansman\\".  DOD has NOTHING redeemable involved in it's content whatsoever. <br /> <br />But AMOLAD is an improvement in songwriting, guitar soloing and tradition Metal guitar riffing (at times.)  It shows a slight improvement in life in the band which was definitely lacking as of late.  I am glad that they have slightly recovered, but that doesn't mean that they have recovered their past glories.  To truly visit those times, all you need to do is go listen to any of their benchmark first seven albums.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Stefani's career is built on image: the platinum blonde pop/ska icon in earlier years to Harajuku girl later on.  From her early recordings with former bands to her solo career, it's no surprise the Queen-Of-Make-Overs needs a Do-Over in that second solo album that comes off as a compilation of confusion than an actual concrete piece of art.  <br /> <br />It's time to focusing on work -- not the image.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|MIAMI VICE, a film surrounded by rumors and preconceptions and a lot of money, is pretty much a bore - if story is important to you.  Michael Mann is a talented director and knows how to move action sequences and capture vistas and light versus darkness, and he can be reliable in creating character interplay. Can be, but in MIAMI VICE there doesn't seem to be a script to follow...<br /><br />Some of the more exciting actors in the field today were employed to deliver this movie about drug deals, undercover agents, and lots of violence, but they are wooden and seem to be reading their few lines from a TV prompter.  There is just no character development to speak of, no camaraderie between Rico and Sonny - factor that made the old TV show watchable.  But the cast is sterling: Colin Farrell (who needs a good meaty role before his allure falters), the fine Jamie Foxx (terribly out of his element here), a miscast flat Gong Li (?why?), the excellent Naomie Harris (by far the strongest character in the film), Elizabeth Rodriquez, Justin Theroux, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds (with an awful southern accent), and a set of new bad guys well chosen in Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, John Ortiz, and Luis Tosar. With talent like that you'd think the thing could fly on its own.  But despite some really gorgeous photography there just isn't anyone or anything to maintain the viewer's interest for the interminable 214 minutes of run time.  One is left with the question 'Wha happened?' Grady Harp, December 06
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|5 stars for the album/compilation itself <br />3 stars for the sound quality <br />average rating becomes 4 stars. <br /> <br />I bought this compilation cause I wanted a decent greatest hits album that had pretty much all the hits and songs that made Peter solo work great.  All the songs you want are here but unfortunatly not in a chronological order as one would like. <br /> <br />I also bought this cause I was excited that all the hits have been REMASTERED.  Unfortunatly the sound quality is nothing to brag about.  I think the original albums where the songs come from had equel or better sound quality than this.  If you are looking for a Peter Gabriels hits all in one package.....this is the one to get.....but if you are like me and are looking forward to a better sound quality due to the tracks all being Remastered...then you are going to be disapointed. <br /> <br />
B000J3FC0Q|5.0|It's amazing what a music video can do. I'd never really paid Amy Winehouse much mind and didn't even bother to check out her debut album when it came out a few years ago. Then I heard she was back earlier this year and to be honest, I probably would've ignored her this time as well.<br /><br />Then I happened to catch the video for \\"Rehab\\", her lead single off this album on MTV and everything changed. Look out for it if you haven't seen it yet but essentially, she sits there looking bored, while her band looks even more bored than she does while they sit and stand at odd angles, playing their various instruments. It's certainly one of the most interesting videos I've seen this year and I was humming the refrain to \\"Rehab\\" for days after. I considered just getting the single but in the end, I just gave in and got the album. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />According to music magazine interviews I've read, Ms Winehouse has drawn heavily from personal experience in putting together this exciting mix of ska, hardcore modern beats and retro grooves. This is old school, but REALLY old school. Winehouse has bypassed the 90s, 80s and 70s and gone for the Motown/Philles inspired sounds and phraseologies of the 60s for probably one of the most honest and heartfelt set of songs I've heard in a long while. Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi provide sparse, stripped down but very clever production and Winehouse's edgy vocal reigns supreme. This is what soul is all about in my view; it's not so much about technical ability, it's more about the emotion, both felt and invoked by the singer. Winehouse scores on both counts.<br /><br />In terms of the music, it's the percussion and drum kicks that get me every time (especially on \\"Rehab\\") but other killer tracks to look out for include: the reggae tinged songs \\"Me & Mr Jones\\" and \\"Just Friends\\"; \\"Love Is A Losing Game\\" just makes you want to cry - for her and for yourself, if you've ever loved and lost; the feisty \\"Tears Dry On Their Own\\"; the oh, so sorry \\"Wake Up Alone\\" and the closer, \\"Addicted\\". There's a lot of feeling here. Even the backing vocals (performed by Winehouse herself), while sounding beautiful, sound like they were sung in the midst of pure heartache.<br /><br />Critics have heaped praise on her left, right and centre and they obviously know what they're talking about. She deserves it all. Though not setting the charts alight, the album and lead single have so far been very well received here in the UK. (Since writing this review last month and the release of a second single, \\"You Know I'm No Good\\", the album has shot up the charts and as of today, 22nd January 2007, stands at #1. Seems like Winehouse could turn out to be \\"The voice of 2007\\" after all, At least in this country).<br /><br />But, as one particular music magazine has heralded, to say that this album is \\"Possibly the best British soul album since Soul II Soul's \\"Club Classics Vol. 1\\"\\", is probably stretching it a tad. It's certainly a slap in the face to the many UK-based soul artistes who have been putting out a lot of high quality stuff over the last 15 or 16 years. It's not their fault that they didn't have, don't have and probably never will have the mass appeal that Winehouse does and while her success may be well earned, it certainly doesn't make her better, much less the best. Not in this house anyway.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong. I'm not hating. She's really good. This album is really good and I hope it gets a US release. It's definitely a banging soul album. I'll probably go get \\"Frank\\" now.<br /><br />But a soul classic? I'm not so sure. Time will tell.<br /><br />By the way, beware: This is dark stuff. And though she may look all sweetness and light on the cover, this is a lady who tells it like it is and doesn't mince words. The \\"explicit lyrics\\" notation at the top there and the parental guidance sticker on the front of her CD are not for play.Alone\\" and the closer, \\"Addicted\\". There's a lot of feeling here.

1558908455|5.0|This movie is an instant cult classic!  I watch it at least twice a year.  This is a must see for everyone.
1878424319|5.0|I first read this book a few years ago when it first came out.  I loved it so much I gave it to all my friends for Christmas that year.<br /><br />The simple presentation is necessary because living by the Four Aggreements will take you deeper into your unconscious beliefs which is a very sacred process that can be painful and challenging to say the least.<br /><br />Basically, what we know is reality is all perception.  We are taught at an early age to believe in things without really being able to question things.  We loose the essence of who we truly are through the process of \\"domestication\\" as he calls it.  When we live our lives based on these beliefs that we create based on false assumtions we get farther and farther away from who we really are.<br /><br />The book is an easy read but the road to discovering your beliefs is quite long and amazing.
0767817664|5.0|I don't write very many reviews but I feel I have to write one for this movie as it holds a very special place in my heart. I saw this when it first came out and went back to see it 2 more times!!! Since then I cannot count how many times I have watched this wondeful movie! If you like horror movies and not just blatant gore than this is for you! Every actor is fabulous. The special effects are STELLAR and it is just a damned great story too! This takes me back to very special time in my life when I was the same age as Charlie, the lead character. I adore this film and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! Not much has topped the absolutely horrifying andgruesome makeup on Amanda Bearse towards the end of the movie and I doubt anything ever will.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|<br /> <br />I have to be honest ! I don't know why everyone are writing such negative reviews about this album? It is quite clear that this is coming from people who clearly never liked hiphop? Love angel music Baby was a very inconsistent effort. It seemed to me like she was just throwing songs up against the wall to see what sticks. The only standouts on that album were : What you Waiting for ?, HollaBack Girl, Harajuku Girls, DangerZone , and Long Way to Go ? The rest was complete filler and the rock songs were just moderately ok on that cd. \\"Rich Girl\\" in my opinion was a very generic effort for Gwen & Eve compared to there first collaboration \\"Blow ur Mind\\". \\"Sweet Escape\\" hands down, is a more consistant album, hiphop or not ? All the songs flow and they all are catchy in some form or another. <br /> <br />  \\"Wind it up\\" is definitley ahead of its time the (Neptunes) production is odd and futuristic. \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is a nice jazzy dance effort very catchy ! \\"Orange county Girl\\" is just ur classic bumpin HipHop Cruising Down south song ! \\"Early Winter\\" is a classic Gwen rock effort ! Now that song stands out more amongst any of the rock songs on L.A.M.B. \\"Now that you got it\\" (Produced By SwiZZ BeatZ)! That is really hard and extremely Catchy ! I love that song that is going to be the head banger in the Clubs. \\"4 in the morning \\" another classic summerey Gwen song (Better than the midtempo stuff on L.A.M.B). \\"Yummy\\" nice neptunes classic production beat. \\"Fluorescent\\" Which obviously is a classic sound for Gwen because she loves Prince. This song  definitley reassures that factor, he could have produced it himself. \\"Breaking Up\\" Another Neptunes club (futuristic) Down south production. Sound like Gwen & The Nep'S where listening to alot of \\"Three 6 Mafia\\" in some of those studio sessions.  \\"Don't Get it Twisted\\" She rent back to her reggie roots which is another Classic sound for Gwen. Which this attempt sounds more authentic than Dr Dre's generic reggieAttempt at \\"Rich Girl\\". \\"U started it\\" Another shout out to Prince ..from the Neptunes elaborate production team.  \\"Wonderful Life\\"..classic sound for Gwen sounds alot like Madonna ! Which it comes from both of there longtime collaborator \\"Nelle Hooper\\".  <br />  <br /> I really can't understand people, this is clearly a more solid effort. The production is miles ahead of the first album. And i really hope Gwen doesn't change anything and keeps doing what she feels. I am not a Hip Hop lover either but I know quality music when I hear it . I listen too a bit of everything. And I think that is were this split decision is coming from. Everyone is use to one thing from this artist. And artist has to evolve with the times . If Gwen didn't jump on the Band Wagon, she would be just like the \\"Cranberries or Sugar Ray\\" . These are artist that kept doing the same thing repeatedly and now they are not here anylonger ! Give Gwen a Break the beats are fresh, even though I do think she could have used a Timbaland track on there ! Just like the other reviewer said LOL ! Gwen is an Artist, just like Prince you never knew what you were going to get on an album. And I think that is what she is trying to accomplish diversity from different extremes ! <br /> <br />  Yes, I have the last 3 NO DOubT Cd's ! And I love them dearly but the market has changed. And I think even Toni Kanal realizes it. If you listen to his contributions to this album they were even different. Live instrumentation and bands are just not in right now. I think even if NO DOuBt got back togther you would see a difference in there sound. And I think that is why they are on Hiatus right now trying to reinvent there sound.  <br /> <br /> <br />A+ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BC8STM|5.0|This is definitely an interestesting DVD for any casual Cher fan. The perforances are fun (though really cheesy at times, but that's part of the wonderfulness that is Cher) and the extras are great. I think one of the coolest parts of this DVD are the little introductions Cher does before you play most of the special features. And her commentary during the little backstage documentary is cute : ). It's obviously doesn't contain all the grandness of The Farewell Tour, but it's still lots of fun : )
B00000IBDW|5.0|Rory Gallagher was one of the all-time great guitarists, period, and there's not a bad release in his entire cataloge.  This was the first of his original lps that I bought and it will always be special for me as the primary introduction for me to his work. <br /> <br />I was fortunate enough to see Rory live in Ft. Worth at the Tarrant County Convention Center in 1976 when he opened for ZZ Top on their World Wide Texas Tour - Rory simply smoked those guys off their own Texas shaped stage!  I will always remember his spoken intro to this release's \\"Souped Up Ford\\" at that show as saying that it was for all the people who, like him, love to be out on the open road in places like Montana and just put their foot into it.  Road rock indeed! <br /> <br />Whether a rocker like \\"I Take What I Want\\" or a more introspective blues like \\"At The Bottom\\" this release is a winner and it's still the one of his that I play the most often. <br /> <br />The only knock on it is that the original master tapes have evidently been lost to the ages so the sound quality of this remaster isn't quite up to the standard set by the rest of the Buddah releases.  But hats off to Rory's brother Donal for making the best sound possible and making this vital release available!
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves play two people who occupied a lake house at two separate times.  Somehow they are able to communicate by letters put in the lake house mailbox, despite the fact that she is living two years in the future from his life.  The movie shows scenes of their separate lives, hers as a doctor and his as an architect.  Their paths cross in unexpected ways, some planned and some by accident.  The premise sounds ridiculous, but somehow these actors make it work and they create an aura that pulls in the audience.  This is recommended viewing.
B000063S6Z|2.0|After the sucess of his album Play, Moby followed that pattern in his new album 18. However, his songs started to go in the wrong direction. What set Moby apart originally was his techno/electronica dance beats that reverberated around a room. Sadly, his music has gotten away from his initial sound, and though he has found greater sucess, it's not what I had come to like so much about Moby. His 1996 album \\"Everything is Wrong\\" is in my opinion his best album. It contained all of the innovative, catchy beats that his music is now lacking. If you'd like to hear what a slightly more techno version of the Killers would sound like, pick up this album. If you're not, or if you're looking for classic Moby, you'll be disappointed. I expected better.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Michael Mann brings \\"Miami Vice\\" to the big screen with this gritty 21st century makeover of the stylish 1984-1989 television series that he created. Miami vice squad detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) lead lives deep undercover, sporting multilayered false identities, living in safe houses, hunting pimps and drug dealers. When some federal agents are killed in a drug buy, FBI Special Agent Fujima (Ciaran Hinds) solicits Miami Vice's help in finding the culprits and the source of their intelligence. Crockett and Tubbs go undercover as cocaine importers, hoping to make a delivery to the white supremacist organization that murdered the feds. In order to get the product from the drug tzar (Luis Tosar) in South America, Sonny and Rico must get past his security specialist Jose Yero (John Ortiz) and gain the trust of his money manager Isabella (Gong Li).<br /><br />If you liked the \\"Miami Vice\\" television show, don't count on liking this movie. Character development is nonexistent, it's never clear what the agents' goals are, people speak in strange clipped phrases, and the visual style is murky. The cinematography by Dion Beebe is technically impressive, in particular his deep focus with striking backgrounds and dark foregrounds. But the overwhelming darkness doesn't serve the film well. The Miami of pastels and art deco that we saw on television in the 1980's was new and interesting. The MTV-style editing was invigorating. The dark, gritty look and disorienting shaky camera of this film have been de rigueur in action movies for 5 years now. They are passe, and they are an impediment to engaging the audience. The frenetic editing is incoherent.<br /><br />With far too many scenes that have no purpose, \\"Miami Vice\\" moves too slowly and lasts too long for an action movie. The \\"director's cut\\" DVD is 6 minutes longer than the theatrical release, at 2 hours 20 minutes. Both versions are director-approved, in fact, and both are too long. The \\"director's cut\\" is a later edit. I can't say much for the stars of \\"Miami Vice\\". Jamie Foxx and his furrowed brow -that would surely give Tubbs away- are unconvincing. Colin Farrell fares only slightly better. Crockett's mustache and Tubbs' beard are creepy. I can't begin to guess the motives behind so much facial hair. Gong Li is showing her age, but has a great deal of presence. John Ortiz makes Yero intriguing. I would have liked to see more of these two, but the rest of the cast is like wallpaper. I won't even get into the botched accents. A much tighter edit and better dialogue would have helped.

John Ortiz makes Yero intriguing. I would have liked to see more of these two, but the rest of the cast is like wallpaper. I won't even get into the botched accents.

B000J10EQU|4.0|\\"Superman Returns\\" picks up the cinematic tradition of Superman after \\"Superman: The Movie\\" (1978) and \\"Superman II\\" (1980), ignoring the ill-conceived, campy Superman III & IV movies. We have a new Superman (Brandon Routh), who abandoned his love affair with Lois Lane and his adopted planet to search for his history in the ruins of Krypton. Returning after a 5-year absence, he resumes his reporting  job at Metropolis' \\"Daily Planet\\", disguised as mild-mannered Clark Kent. Still pining for star reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), Clark finds that she has taken up with the boss' nephew Richard White (James Marsden), with whom she has a young son. Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey), however, has not abandoned his old ways. Out of prison once again, he plans to become the ultimate real estate mogul by replacing North America with his own brand new continent, aided by crystals he has stolen from Superman's Fortress of Solitude.<br /><br />I think fans will rank \\"Superman Returns\\" lower than Superman I & II but higher than the other sequels. The story is fine. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey, as Lex Luther and his bubble-headed mistress, are sufficiently heavyweight thespians to inject some laughs into the adventure without undermining it. Brandon Routh makes a beautiful superhero, and I think that returning to a young image was probably smart. This is an entertaining movie with a few conspicuous flaws: The action sequences are the least satisfying aspect of the film. They seem compulsory and flat. Lois Lane is bland. She doesn't have enough personality to keep our interest, much less Superman's. Kate Bosworth is clearly too young for the role -though I suspect that is to avoid having Lois look older than the new, youthful Superman. And, at 2 hours 34 minutes, this movie is too long. More interesting action and a more forceful Lois Lane would have saved \\"Superman Returns\\" from mediocrity. As it is, a marginal 3 ½ stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner 2006 single disc): No bonus features. Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.features.

B000J4QWMC|1.0|I believe my husband said it best after we watched the movie a few hours ago. On it's own, it would have been a decent movie... but slapping the Miami Vice title on it, as well as the familiar character names is it's downfall. Part of what made the show so great was the 80s cheese, and there's none of that in this movie. Too many times 'classics' are modernized and ruined in the process, look at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Depp did a good job in it but otherwise it sucked and I'll take the the Wilder version any day. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this movie came too late. By doing it now, they were left with basically two choices, make a lame spoof of it like Starsky & Hutch or change it like they did. It really was a lose/lose situation and really it should have just been left alone.
B000G8NXYQ|2.0|There are some funny moments here, particularly with the dysfunctional family around a dinner table, but aside from that, this movie is awful, a bore, stupid, moronic, like most of Fellini's work.
B000GRUS22|4.0|I love Enigma. I love to chill out on a cold winter's night with a cup of hot chocolate and an Enigma cd. I've been an Enigma fan for several years now. I have to admit I wasn't all that fond of Enigma's last album \\"Voyageur\\". While I have to give credit to Michael Cretu from branching out from his traditional sound of ambient/pop music, the songs unfortunately didn't resonate with me like his previous albums did. I was a bit wary of \\"A Posteriori\\" but thankfully I was wrong. \\"A Posteriori\\" is certainly not like his first two albums but it certainly is not \\"Voyageur\\" part two. I thought the music shared all the elements of Enigma's past and present music. I was rather disappointed that Ruth-Ann and Sandra Cretu didn't contribute their enchanting vocals to \\"A Posteriori\\". The woman Michael got to sing on the album was quite good though. I enjoyed her vocals quite a bit.Nothing will ever beat Enigma's earlier albums but \\"A Posteriori\\" certainly makes up for \\"Voyageur\\" in my book.
0060934913|5.0|Anyone who is even thinking of going into the food preparation business must read this first.  While being very funny Mr. Bourdain gives a painfully accurate view of just what goes on in a professional kitchen.  Maybe even more important, he explains exactly what it takes to be a chef in a modern kitchen.<br /><br />I am a chef and what Mr. Bourdain shows is just what goes on in a resturaunts kitchen.  If you think you can prepare 100 meals in 2 1/2 hours with minimal help, you just might have what it takes, but first read this book.<br /><br />For you in the profession, you will not find a truer or funnier book.  Your sides will ache just from seeing yourself in the many charactors.  Bon Appitette
B00005JNJV|4.0|This one's much more entertaining than the other Batman movies. It's a good story based on Bruce Wayne's sincere desire to see justice done and his willingness to lose all to accomplish it. There wasn't too much sensuality although Katie Holmes wore some tight shirts and it must have been chilly on the set.
0679736646|4.0|Ubik is the ball in a ping-pong game played by six(or, maybe, seven) extra-terrestrials, each vying for attention. In a P.K.D. novel, reality is a hot-potato passed around. You think you know who is the main character? Wait a few chapters. Finally one emerges.  You think he is real? Or that his reality is real? Guess again. The fun and the pain of the (....) trip is to dive into Poe's maelstorm, grab on to whatever floats, and try to survive..or even die..it doesn't matter cause Death itself is transitory, here. But when one wants to delve into the mysteries, not of Joe Chip, but of you, your most ubiquitous soul..(yeah, let's face it...we yearn for the immortality shown us in red lighted psychotic Dickian visions)we become hooked. Ubik, in my opinion is not as good as TSEP, which may be the Best or Martian Time-Slip, which may be the Best, or A Scanner Darkly, which may be the Best, but it is so perfect that it just may be the Best. Give me half-life or give me death...A very satisfying hoodonit.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Matt Damon plays a CIA agent (Bourne) who loses his identity after a botched job. His handlers think he is a rogue agent and call in all \\"assets\\" to take him out. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a classy, realistic film. By realistic, I mean not only the various sets in Paris and Switzerland and on a trawler in the Mediterranean, but the fact that Damon, when he is zapping some bad guy, usually finds himself in a hell of a fight. The bad guys are GOOD! That goes to make this a more believeable thriller than, say, MI III, where the bad guys are push overs and our hero is amazing. Damon does a great acting job as a believeably tough guy who can think fast on his feet. There is a sweet, understated love interest with Franka Potente, a fresh screen face, not too beautiful, which also lends to realism, who plays a stranger whom Damon befriends. Adapted from Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name, the screenplay is tight and keeps the viewer wondering, along with Damon, who he is and how he will survive. In essense, this is a chase-and-run flick, with the CIA (again) as the bad guys. They give a good account of themselves, however, but Damon was apparently trained to be the best. I'll take Damon to watch my back any time over Tom Cruise when things go down. Recommended highly.
B000A0X6HE|1.0|This is an awesome film. Really! It is the quintessential psychotic episode portrayed by the guy who has no medication, is unknowing, has no formal diagnosis and no where to run. He slowly but so vividly spirals down the stair steps of the dark pit into raw and pure insanity. The movie portrays his footsteps ingeniously. And indeed Bale acts this out magnificently. We again have the ingenious use of a delusional and visual hallucination antagonist, like which was so beautifully utilized in Fight Club. It shouts out his paranoid delusional mental state and visual unreal images that so lusciously define authentic psychosis. <br /> <br />Ah, but this plot line has grown so old over the years, but for Fight Club, Secret Window, Beau Mind, Fisher King, Donny's Little Darko, etc. I mean, how much mileage does Hollywood seriously expect to get out of this? <br /> <br />And of course, Hollywood has its typical slant. Well, and because psychosis is not a \\"respectable\\" illness, like cancer, Parkinson's, diabetes or broken neck paralysis. No... Hollywood has thought this out long and hard and has deemed that mental illness is the gutter illness. So the film is fraught with all kinds of the typical mental illness gutter stereotypes, like bale's live-in-hooker and his homicidal tendencies - like all mentally ill people have them - and why are we all homicidal? Well because Hollywood says so, that's why! And of course homicidal, mentally ill psychotic people are what makes Hollywood money. And we're talking lots of money. Well and actors too. Just ask Bale. <br /> <br />Come on Hollywood, give us something more. You can do better than this. Next time, why don't you throw in the 3 day involuntary commitment, or that a 10 mg dose of tongue dissolvable Zyprexa pops you out of this type of insanity in about 3 hours and gets us back to 50% from a 0%. Or the years and years of counseling that it takes to get yourself back to about 60%. Or the Social Security Disability that many of uswill have to get on. Or the 20% that commit suicide with this type of illness. Or that our spouses will divorce us because of it. I mean, after all, this film is about the 1 percent of the population who has paranoid schizophrenia (2.5 million US people) and the 1 percent of the population who has paranoid psychotic bipolar I (another 2.5 million US people), and the 1 percent of the population who has depression with psychotic features (another 2.5 million US people), and the 500,000 mothers who have post-partum psychosis. Yea, this film is about the oppression of about 8 million US people. <br /> <br />Next time, show the real story and the real suffering that all of us go through every day. Please quit running us through your Hollywood gutter. A lot of us are respectable individuals with a severe chronic incurable mental illness. And most of us are balancing 5 different medications just to survive it. We didn't ask for this crap. Some of us are even airborne rangers. Next time, show the real deal, and then we'll all give you more than 1 star. Have a nice day!
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I am surpised by the amount of negative reviews for this CD.  This album is dance music not too far removed from Love, Angel, Music Baby.  In fact, it is slightly more adventurous and futurist.  I am no hip-hop fan but like this CD because it more sacharine than your average hip hop. I have been playing this CD for 4 days now.  It's a grower as I find I like it more each time I play it. <br />\\"Wind It Up\\" is something totally different from what's on the radio. It's almost hypnotic.  I like the sampling of \\"Lonely Goatherd\\" it's bold and original. <br />\\"The Sweet Escape\\" is fun and breezy like \\"Cherish\\" by Madonna.  <br />\\"Orange County Girl\\" chorus is reminiscent of certain parts of \\"ExGirlfriend\\" from Gwen's No Doubt days. <br />\\"Early Winter\\" is hauntingly beautiful and Gwen sings with all her heart. <br />\\"Now That You've Got It\\" is this album's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" a catchy beat that emphasizes Gwen's voice.  <br />\\"4 In the Morning\\" is a very pretty song.  More proof of the close relationship between Gwen and former lover Tony Kanal. <br />\\"Yummy\\" is my favorite track!  I have been singing it for days. Love the military drums. <br />\\"Fluorescent\\" is extremely funky and Gwen delivers the goods on this one. Another pairing with Tony Kanal. <br />\\"Breakin' Up\\" is a clever play on words comparing a cell phone disconnection to the end of a relationship.  <br />\\"Don't Get it Twisted\\" has a clever sample and has a hook phrase if ever there was one. \\"Entrance of the Gladiators\\" aka the circus music.  <br />\\"U Started It\\" has an 80's feel to it.  Good song. <br />\\"Wonderful Life\\" is also haunting in a Depeche Mode kind of way thanks to Martin Gore on guitar.  Linda Perry who co-wrote \\"What You Waiting For?\\" pairs with Gwen again on a great song. <br /> <br />I like Gwen rocking with No Doubt and Gwen as a funky, hip-hop lite solo artist.  <br /> <br />Not as good as LAMB, but a personal favorite of mine! <br /> <br /> <br />

B000002KIE|5.0|The energy and intensity of this album are still fresh after 30 years.  While most of my older albums are forgotten, this one gets still gets played.  A must listen.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is a very enjoyable CD.  Eric Clapton and JJ Cale compliment each other so well vocally and on the guitar. They harmonize so well on the track Danger.  Eric's guitar playing is so slick throughout the entire disc.  Sporting Life Blues is another highlight on this disc.  It has a classic  slow tempo blues sound. Dead End Road is a fun upbeat song that really gets me moving.  I love the energetic piano and fiddle  playing on this song very much.  It's Easy is a track about the art of living the simple life.  I love the lyrics to this song.  Heads in Georgia has a slow sensual sounding quality to it. It is interesting song about how a person's mind and body can be in two separate places.  Missing Person is a light fun sounding track about a woman who disappears without saying a word.  This song is one of my favorites.  Three Little Girls is a sweet song.  I love the harmonica playing on this track.  Don't Cry Sister is another standout track in which Clapton and Cale harmonize so well together.  The Road to Escondido is one of the best musical collaborations of 2006.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is Charles Mingus' best and most musically accessible alsbum.  Recorded in 1959, it is soul stirring, great hard bebop with some fantastic sax playing by the great Booker Ervin.  If you are into jazz, then this is an essential addition to your collection.  I can never get tired of hearing this CD.
6305388458|5.0|When I was 16 years old, I proudly crossed a picket line of outraged fundamentalists to see \\"Monty Python's Life of Brian.\\"  I was a big Python fan at that time and remain one to this day.  I got a lot more from a recent viewing than I did as a teenager.  With relentless, deceptively intelligent silliness, Britain's most famous comedy troupe skewers the cliches of countless Hollywood biblical epics while finding the lighter side of public stonings and crucifiction.  Some of the sharpest scenes skewer divisive resistance movements that are long on talk and short on action.  This is a terrific comedy.
B00005MP58|5.0|I only knew this adaptation of the Jane Austen novel by reputation before I rented it in August.  It made Colin Firth into a star, and apparently made lots of British boys named Darcy at around the time the series came out.  My wife and I were riveted by this series -- the adaptation is true to the book's letter and spirit, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle lead a uniformly excellent cast (though Alison Steadman's over-the-top Mrs. Bennett is a little too shrill and unsympathetic for my taste, the satirical edge a little too harsh). <br /> <br />The boxed set unfortunately is a little light on the extras -- there is a  behind the scenes video which is vaguely informative, no commentary tracks, and admittedly, one probably shouldn't expect much of a 1995 series that was presumably produced without a deluxe DVD issue in mind.  But it's very well worth having for a classic adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Spike Lee has created an imaginative and gripping thriller with \\"Inside Man\\". Collecting some of the biggest names on screen, Lee has put together a film that has both the thrills and twists to entertain, and the comments on society to give something more when the credits have rolled by.<br /><br />Set in New York, the viewer enters the world of Dalton Russell, a bank robber with a so-called \\"perfect plan\\", and Detective Keith Frazier, who arrives to negotiate with the team of robbers. Add in the sub-plots of Arthur Case, who has a lot to lose in this robbery, and Madeleine White, a type of \\"discrete\\" agent with some less than legal influence, and you have a complex story line that gives you enough to think about to cope with a couple of viewings.<br /><br />The names filling the credits are impressive, making the movie all the more enjoyable. Jodie Foster, (White), Denzel Washington, (Frazier), Clive Owen, (Russell, a surprisingly good bad guy!), Christopher Plummer, (Case, and Willem Dafoe all make this movie special in their own ways. They are all top grade actors with the skills to make the story live.<br /><br />The social commentary is present all through the film at varying levels. For the most part, it is a subtle presence in the background, hardly making itself felt, but there none-the-less. At other moments, it is much more obvious. My own favourite scene is one betweem Dalton Russell and Brian, the young boy with his Playstation Portable and the violent games. Dalton asks about the game in which one has to do things such as kill and destroy people, (extremely graphically). Russell promises to have a word with Brian's father about the game. The entire movie is saturated with a social commentary on the corruption and violence that surrounds us, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />This is one of the best films I have seen recently and is a movie that has given me lots to think about and consider. It is powerful in its twists, well-acted and very well executed in all aspects. It is thoroughly enjoyable on a number of different levels. A great movie!ecuted in all aspects. It is thoroughly enjoyable on a number of different levels. A great movie!
B00005JPCA|1.0|I thought this should have been 006 or some other agent. This was totally out of character he made a lot of noise wherever he was. The originally character played by Sean Connery had much more class, was a true secret agent with many creative hidden weapons and above all would never fall in love!! He as a confirmed bachelor and everyone knew that including the sexy women he met along the way!

Some of my favorites are \\"We would love to stand here and chat, but we got to get to the lobby to wait for the limosine\\" and \\"this is my new special friend.\\"  What can I say, this movie never grows tired to me. Although it wasn't the first mockumentary (I believe Albert Brooks \\"Real Life\\" was one, if not the first) this still is considered by most THE mocumentary that now inspired movie hits like Borat. <br /> <br />Please watch this, and then watch it again if you din't get it the frist time, and find yourself growing to like this really funny movie.
032147404X|3.0|I really wanted to write a glowing review for \\"The Digital Photography Book\\"... I've been looking for a good tome of insider tips for digital SLRs for a long time, so when I found Kelby's book I was ecstatic! A quick skim showed many great tips; however, after reading the first page of chapter 1 where he carried on about the phrase \\"TACK SHARP\\" I began to lose faith.<br /><br />Here is an excerpt (talking about the origins of the phrase Tack Sharp - meaning a \\"clear photo\\"):<br /><br />\\"TACK stands for Technically Accurate Cibachrome Kelvin (which refers to the color temperature of light in photographs), and SHARP stands for Shutter Hyperfocal At Refracted Polarization. Now, these may seem like highly technical terms at first, but once you realize that I totally made them up, it doesn't seem so complicated, does it? Now, you have to admit, it sounded pretty legitimate at first. I mean, I almost had ya, didn't I? Come on, you know I had you, and I'll bet it was that \\"color temperature of light\\" thing I put in parenthesis that helped sell the idea that it was real, right? It's okay to admit you were fooled...\\"<br /><br />Is this for real? Maybe his editor was asleep. He makes a lame joke out of trying to fool the reader, then carries on for half a paragraph laughing at how clever he is! I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but he continued with this 'fooled ya' theme by writing fake subheadings on the next SIX sections:<br /><br />The Real Secret to Getting Sharp Photos<br />\\"sorry about duping you with \\"The Real Secret to Getting Sharp Photos\\" headline...\\"<br /><br />Perhaps Even More Important Than That<br />\\"Again, ignore that headline. It's just a cheap come-on to get you to keep reading.\\"<br /><br />If You Skip This, Throw Away Your Camera<br />\\"Still a fake headline. Don't let it throw you.\\"<br /><br />If You Do This Wrong, It Will Lock Up<br />\\"It's not as good as the last fake headline, but we're only one more page away from the real chapter content,so I'm backing it off a little.\\"<br /><br />It's Time to Get Serious<br />\\"I have good news: Not only are we at the end of this \\"fake headline\\" thing, you'll also be happy to know that from here on out, the rest of the book isn't laced with the wonderfully inspired (lame) humor you found on these first few pages.\\"<br /><br />Oh... Okay - so he's dropping the annoying stuff. Good. On to learn.<br /><br />But NO! In Chapter 2, right away he's at it again! Below he describes ways to get around the problem of pollen dulling the color of flowers (???)<br /><br />\\"Now, there is a special photographic filter (called the Flora 61B from PhotoDynamics) that can help reduce the effects of this pollination and both bring back the sharpness and reduce the graying effect, but because of U.S. trade sanctions imposed by the Federal Trade Commission, we can no longer buy this filter direct. Especially because I totally made this whole thing up. I can't believe you fell for this two chapters in a row. Seriously, how are you going to get good flower photos if you're falling for the old Flora 61B trick? Okay, I'm just teasing you, but seriously...\\"<br /><br />I hate having to stay on constant patrol for full paragraphs of combed cr*p when I'm trying to learn something new! I don't care how good the \\"real\\" content is, I'm not going to sift through fertilizer to get to it!<br /><br />If you find this type of humor funny, or wonder what I'm making such a big deal about, then you'll probably find this a very fun, interesting read.<br /><br />If you don't like wondering whether or not the author is \\"pulling your leg this time, too\\", then you'll probably want to chuck this book out the window by the third chapter.
B000A88EVE|4.0|Nicolas Roeg is a curious, ambitious director and \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" is one of his most curious and ambitious films. Made in the wake of success from films like Walkabout, this film is 1 of 3 movies by Roeg that made it into The Criterion Collection. I've only seen two other Roeg films...Walkabout and Don't Look Now. I don't think that this film is better than either of those and it certainly has more flaws, but it is definitely a trippy experience. David Bowie makes his screen debut as Thomas, an alien who comes to Earth to bring water back to his dying planet. Once on Earth, he becomes a millionaire by becoming head of a huge corporation; He begins an affair with a young woman Mary-Lou (Candy Clark) and receives help in his quest from Nathan Bryce (a very young Rip Torn). Bowie makes it clear in this film that he's a good actor, even though he looks a little like Annie Lennox in the film. It's hard to flaunt acting skills in a movie like this, because this movie is not based on plot. In fact, the plot is actually a pretty minute part of this film. This film is more focused on its visuals and, as with other Roeg films, there's plenty of that. Roeg was a cinematographer, before becoming a director and it's clear he always had a hand in the visual style of his films. They all have that unmistakable mark made by their creator. The Man Who Fell to Earth couldn't have been made by many directors, because it is so essentially built on images. As usual, Roeg is comfortable with nudity and there's plenty of that here. I think that Walkabout and Don't Look Now are perfect films and if they're not perfect, they're close to it. The Man Who Fell to Earth is not perfect...It's overlong (137 minutes), sometimes doesn't have enough emphasis on the plot, but it still is worth seeing. It's a science-fiction film for people who don't even like science fiction. If you like stunning cinematography (or, at least, appreciate it). I'd recommend definitely checking this movie out. <br /> <br />GRADE: B-

His writing style and examples make this an easy read and he doesn't delve into the technical stuff.  A MUST READ for anyone thinking about hiring a web designer.
B00003CXB2|4.0|This movie was fantastic! the acting and the imagery was superb. peter o'toole-whom i had never seen in a movie previously-gives a fantastic performance.  History is intertwined with biography in the film-from WWI and the the Sykes-Picot agreement to Lawrence's assimilation into Arabic tribal culture to his relationship with Ali... This movie politely and tastefully touches on the subject of Lawrence's discreet homosexuality (after all, the film was made in 1962.)  A great epic, beautiful and accurate.  However, after seeing this film I do think that sloppily made inaccurate movies like Oliver Stone's Alexander-which is a bastardization of history-should be shot out of a cannon.
B00023B1LC|5.0|It's been a very long time since I enjoyed watching a movie this much.<br /><br />In fact I have to go back to the 1960s when the old Town Theater in Watertown, NY used to have James Bond marathons.  The kids would all cheer when James got out of a tough spot.<br /><br />This movie is sort of a James Bond for adults.  It closes the gap between what's totally impossible and what could be somewhat believable (with a little imagination that is).<br /><br />The characters captured my interest immediately due to the perfect casting.  You feel like these are real people.<br /><br />They try to keep the main character sort of impersonable.  You rarely see him eat anything, no big sex scenes.  All of this is consistent with making him appear to be almost super human.<br /><br />It is quite funny at times as the girlfriend tries to comprehend what she has gotten herself into.  \\"He went out the window.  Why would somebody do that ?\\"<br /><br />Technically there are great fight scenes and weapons throughout the movie. They use a lot of silencers.  It is true a ball point pen can be used to inflict serious injury on someone.  However I don't know how true it is that two karate experts can continously smash each other in the face.<br /><br />Some people believe that the guy who killed Robert Kennedy was under some sort of mind control.  He doesn't remember anything about what happened.<br /><br />We saw recently that a former KGB agent was poisoned in England with some bizzare radioactive substance.<br /><br />Yes those intelligence agencies are still out there.<br /><br />As often happens when people create something dangerous they themselves eventually become the victims of their own creation.<br /><br />Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00009N80R Clint Eastwood Collection: Where Eagles Dare]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000M53GNG Thunderball]]
B00005JPDL|5.0|Fans of Nancy Meyers will notice a lot of similarities in camera shots, score and those special little moments that lift a movie out of the ordinary between The Holiday and two of her previous outings - Something's Gotta Give and The Parent Trap. But hey, if it works, don't knock it. These familiar devises only made the movie feel delightfully comfortable. The attention to detail in every area is one thing that makes a Nancy Meyers film stand out. The sets are truly amazing down to the last carefully placed prop - they all have this writer/director/producer's footprint all over them. How many people didn't want to instantly move in to Diane Keaton's beach house in Something's Gotta Give? The sets in The Holiday conjure the same magic, whether it is the amazing LA home of Cameron Diaz's character or the atmospheric and enchanting home of her elderly next door neighbour. Ms. Meyers can even be forgiven for her unashamedly sterotypical portrayl of England in the snow - for the British characters are warm and witty - a welcome departure from the \\"English bad guy\\".  <br />Go prepared with a box of hankies to this film as you will laugh and cry, just when you least expect it. A great movie for Christmas, you will leave the theatre wanting to overhaul your own life. For the other thing that Nancy Meyers does so expertly is get inside the audience's head (possibly only the female audience) - you can almost hear her say \\"come on girls - if you're not happy you can change it. Please feel empowered.\\" <br />It's funny, The Parent Trap was a film for tweens, Something's Gotta Give was meant to speak to the over 50's and this film is targeted at the 30-40 age range - but all films work for all ages, because the message is exactly the same. Anyway, The Holiday is a delightful feel-good treat that you will watch time and time again - oh and there's a fun Lindsay Lohan cameo for any Parent Trap die hards.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Yes these are not the original recordings. Nor are there any new songs here. If you are a \\"purist\\" (whatever that entails) then don't buy this. I myself am a \\"purist\\" (again___) and have been for the past 32 years of my life. I grew up listening to the Beatles, my first song I remember is Blue Jay Way. In no way could you improve on the originals, I think we would all agree on that. The Beatles simply are the the Beatles, yet this collection brought together for the musical \\"Love\\" is pretty darn good. Listen to the transitions between songs, the \\"Taxman\\" guitar solo dropped into Drive My Car (pretty cool), or my favorite \\"Within You Without You\\" / \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" mash-up (captures that whole pyschedelic groove perfectly). The album is almost dizzying the way the sounds crash and blend into each other. It's awesome. Do these improve on the originals? No. Nothing could, but they give a pretty cool, and different interpretation into these classic gems. <br /> <br />I think more than anything (in direct oppposition to the \\"Martin is a hack\\" below) this shows how big a part Martin played in the studio with the Beatles. Anyone even remotely familiar with the Beatles will recognize Martin's importance to group. These songs in their original state outshine anything currently in radio rotation (ok maybe not Octopus's Garden!!!), so this collection should not be someone's introduction to the Beatles, buy the originals (Revolver, Rubber Soul, and the White Album). But for those of us who can quote lyrics verbatim, link A-side singles with their prospective B-sides, etc., buy this album. For me it brought back memories of hearing the originals the first time around. Brilliant!!!
B000ION79Y|5.0|When I went to rent this gem, I was joking with a friend that we should ask the girl at the counter if she thought this one was good. <br /> <br />To my surprise she was totally excited and said she thinks Segal is so hot, and that she is glad he lost weight for the amazing new movie. <br /> <br />She was obviously not a true fan because when I asked her if she saw him on the Mojo Priest Tour she had no clue. <br /> <br />Regardless, I popped this bad boy in and was blown away. <br />The cover art was a photoshop, Seagal was still pushing 300lbs, so he is still a beast. <br /> <br />Half the movie was over dubbed, I went back to check to see if I selected english overdub in the menu. No sir, this must be a new trend in movie making, to lose your audio tracks or rather not be able to use them, and overdub actors voices with different voices through out the movie. <br /> <br />The fighting as mentioned before has Seagal, slapping away at his foes, which totally turned me on.  The story was amazing, a drug that mutates, people into savage killers, yet leaves them civilized at the same time. <br /> <br />The dirt bike scene from the beginning was my favorite, they used the dirt bike sound effects from Grand Theft Auto then a helicopter blew it up with missiles that looked a lot like black jacks exploding. <br /> <br />Overall, the first 15 minutes summed it up. <br /> <br />AWESOME.  Don't rent this movie buy it, keep them making this movies please.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|the martins are musical geniuses.  every song is unbelievable.  even if you're a first time beatles listener or a die-hard fan you are going to \\"love\\" what they did with these songs.  i have not stopped listening to it for three days now, simly amazing.
B000ILYYJE|4.0|The audios are good but videos could of included some rare footage. It seemed like an after thought & they picked videos from previous released videos. This was the reason it didn't get 5 stars. <br /> <br />I had The Doors on vinyl and finally decided to get this box set. Now I'm not familiar w/ the previous box set but this includes all the 6 Doors albums. Yeah, American Prayer came out later but that was post-Jim. So you don't know if he would agree w/ the arrangements on that album. Plus you have the remaining Doors who produced 2 more albums post-Jim. Who would of known if Jim ever came back from Paris would he continue playing w/ them.  I've read a number of books of The Doors and many speculations of Jim writing screen plays to moving to New York to working on a solo album. I don't own much rare recordings or bootlegs so the bonus tracks are a treat for me. Too bad the video aspect wasn't thought out. All of the videos except for one I have in my Doors DVD collection. As an audio standpoint this is a good deal and really enjoy it.  <br /> <br />This package is the 6 albums The Doors includes 2 disc per album.  <br />You have the CD w/ bonus tracks and a DVD disc. <br />Each Album/CD is a tri-fold that copies the original artwork front & back cover. Inside includes the art from that album as well as a booklet w/ some cool pics gives in detail the making of that record. <br />Each DVD includes the entire album in 5.1 Surround Sound. <br />Photo Gallery w/ some very cool photos and 2 videos of the songs from that album. <br />Now the videos aren't any rare footage. If you have The Soundstage Performances, Hollywood Bowl, and the Dance On Fire DVDs. The only one I don't recognize is Crawling King Snake that was shot in The Doors rehearsal studio filmed for a 1971 Australian TV. This is rare footage I haven't seen of Jim performing a song from L.A. Woman album. Of course there must be some collectors out there who have this whole show. But it was a treat for me toview. <br /> <br />The Doors  <br />debut album includes some of my favorite tracks The Crystal Ship, Light My Fire and The End. Also 3 bonus tracks. 2 versions of Moonlight Drive. The 2nd version was previously unissued. Matter of fact version 2 of Moonlight Drive reminds me a little of Alabama Song. 3rd previously unissued track is Indian Summer which is on Morrison Hotel CD. This is a sort of acoustic song that shows off Jim vocals. <br />Videos include Break On Through, which is on Dance On Fire DVD. <br />The End is from The Soundstage Performances DVD Toronto performance, 1967 <br /> <br />Strange Days  <br />one of my favorite Doors albums has my all time favorite track When The Music's Over . The bonus tracks comes w/ People Are Strange false starts & in studio talking. It's John Densmore talking to producer Paul Rothchild. This is only about a minute long so it's no alternative version of the song just the talking before they start. <br />The other bonus track is Love Me Two Times which is listed as Take 3. I really couldn't hear a difference. <br />The videos include Love Me Two Times and When The Music's Over both from Europe Concert, 1968. These are on The Soundstage Performances DVD. <br /> <br />Waiting For The Sun  <br />has 5 bonus tracks. Albinoni's Adiago In G Minor an instrumental that was included in American Prayer lp. Not To Touch The Earth has a minute of dialogue w/ Jim. If only a minute long it was interesting hearing Jim goofing around. <br />Then you have 2 more takes of Not To Touch The Earth. Take 1 time is 4:22 as Take 2 is 3:58. <br />A 17 minute poem of Celebration of The Lizard which was printed inside the album cover. This is noted as \\"work in progress\\" there are some lines that are not in the printed version of the album. <br />Videos in Spanish Caravan from Live Hollywood Bowl, 1968 from the DVD of the same name. <br />The Unknown Soldier is the performance from The Soundstage Performances DVD. <br /> <br />The Soft Parade <br />The Soft Parade is my fav song from this album. The 6 bonus tracks are Who Scared You that is on Weird Scenes Inside The Goldmine album. Good song btw. 2 versions of Whiskey, Mystics And Men, a very good tune. Push Push is more of an instrumental reminds me of Vince Guaraldi (Charlie Brown song) w/ the only chorus of the band singing repetitively \\"Push Push\\"  <br />They list 2 versions of Touch Me  but really version 1 is just 27 seconds of talking in the studio. It's maybe Paul Rothchild producer talking to John Densmore about the positioning of the snare drum mic. <br />Videos include Soft Parade and Touch Me both from Soundstage Performance DVD. <br /> <br />Morrison Hotel <br />Is The Doors going back to basics w/ bluesy tunes. One of the biggest hits was Roadhouse Blues. Another good tune I like is Queen of The Highway. Now for bonus tracks I would say this is the best CD that included 10 bonus tracks. 3 versions of Roadhouse Blues which Jim starts off w/ Money Beats Soul poem. There is also a funny line on Peace Frog w/ a false start. It seems the band is dragging before Jim sings. Jim says to the band \\"Boy you guys sound like a drunken cripple walking up a flight of stairs, man...drunken flight of stairs\\". A jazzy version of Queen of The Highway which I find interesting for an alternative sound. <br />2 videos from Dance On Fire DVD are Roudhouse Blues and Wild Child. <br /> <br />L.A. Woman <br />Final album of The Doors w/ Jim that includes my all time favorite \\"Riders On The Storm.\\" The bonus tracks are only 2 compared to previous CD this is pretty dismal. You have Orange County Suite a song about Jim's girl Pamela. I know Jim pitched this to The Doors but they passed on it a number of times. To tell the truth it's very good song. This was also on The Doors Boxset. The other track is (You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further which is on Weird Scenes In The Goldmine album. <br />Videos include The Changeling that was edited from the Soft Parade DVD..The second video is Crawling King Snake which I haven't seen before footage. This is from 1971, The Doors rehearsal space filmed for Australian TV. It was a very cool performance I would like to know more about this TV appearance.
B000002UJQ|5.0|classic timeless album. will be as good 50 years from now as today. deserving of no less than 5 stars.

B00005PJ8O|5.0|Unfurling from the famous scene showing Gen. George Smith Patton (1885-1945) delivering his rah-rah-troops sermon before the gigantic awe-inspiring American flag, this 1970 film is a wonderful character depiction of a complicated hero. Always true to his ideals, which include his self-confessed inability to keep his \\"big mouth shut,\\" he incurred the wrath of his good buddy \\"Ike\\" and Omar Bradley, brilliantly played by Karl Malden (b. 1912).<br /><br />Patton was also feared but ultimately revered by his soldiers, as well as arch-enemy Erwin Rommel, \\"The Desert Fox.\\" Rommel, in fact, studied Patton's character and was fascinated that Patton wrote poetry and believed in reincarnation.<br /><br />Unforgettable scenes include Patton ordering the driver of his Jeep to a graveyard in Tunisia. \\"There's no graveyard there, sir,\\" said his driver. \\"There is,\\" said Patton. \\"I fought there.\\"<br /><br />He believed that, in a former life, he was the great Carthaginian general Hannibal, and was saddened by Hannibal's brilliance and loss. As a child, Patton was well versed with bios of military heroes as far back as in the immortal Iliad.<br /><br />Another memorable scene has the raspy-voiced Patton ordering the Chaplain to pray for good weather. Although a general can motivate his troops only so far, the weather must cooperate - it didn't, Patton confided to the Chaplain, and Napolean lost at Waterloo. Not surprisingly, Patton believed he was one of Napoleon's soldiers. Patton's order of prayer had the lucky coincidence of stopping a snowstorm in its tracks so Patton's Third Army could advance in victory.<br /><br />In the midst of deadly battle where Patton views himself as utterly invincible, he remarks, \\"God, I love it here!\\" Every nuance of the noble, arrogant, elitist, insubordinately lovable general is brilliantly portrayed by George C. Scott (1927-1999). At age 43, Scott famously declined his Oscar award for best actor stating the Oscars were nothing but a \\"meat market.\\" Patton, on the other hand, adored the accoutrements of power: his numerous medals and celebratory garments including polished helmet, ivory pistol and riding jodhpurs!<br /><br />One of the greatest films ever made, with wonderfully little blood and gore, what would the real George Smith Patton think of the ridiculous war raging overseas today in Iraq? Or perhaps he is over there in another carnation. Whose?ccoutrements of power: his numerous medals and celebratory garments including polished helmet, ivory pistol and riding jodhpurs!

B00008H2LB|3.0|...but I can't.  At least, not entirely.  \\"Faint,\\" \\"Breaking the Habit,\\" and \\"Numb\\" in particular just sound too good.<br /><br />One-note lyrical concept?  Check.  With these guys, it's always That Darn Girl's fault that the singer is (or at least poses as) inclined toward various degrees of violence against someone or another.  Usually himself.  I don't believe it for a moment, but what the heck.  As gimmicks go, I guess they could have done worse.<br /><br />Once you learn to go with the ridiculous lyrical flow, let's face it: the guitars sound really f*in good.  Heaven knows enough money was thrown at them.  Relax, disengage your mind as best you can, and let the angst wash over.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|I just picked up this album the other day, and it is absolutely amazing.  This was my first tom waits album and it is the perfect starting place (I have since picked up Swordfishtrombone, Rain Dogs and Mule Variations).  Waits is a musical genius, combining Beefheartesque vocals with a style all his own, and with more touching ballads and lyrics.  This is a great album and I recommend it for beginners and exemplify it as a must have for experienced Waits listeners.  \\"Road to Peace\\" is one of the most effective political escapades I've heard in years.  Don't listen to anybody who believes Greeday has the most to say recently.  \\"Lie to Me\\" is another favorite of mine.
B0000640SA|5.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Finishing watching this for the 5th or 6th time today, I learned yet another piece to the puzzle of this movie which put it together in a way that blew me away as much as the first time I watched it.<br /><br />I can go in depth into the reviews and how good the movie is, but that's been done already to death.  I'll explain to you still confused how this movie works, starting from the true beginning<br /><br />- All the black-and-white scenes come before the movie... Leonard is already on his journey attempting to find John G. and being lead by Officer Gammell on the phone (Teddy).  He finally finds the \\"John G.\\" guy, a drug dealer called Jimmy Grant, and kills him.  It's revealed now that Teddy has already helped Leonard find the killer of his wife the year before, but since then he has only been using Leonard's condition and his need for vengeance for his own shady means---he set up Jimmy the drug dealer by pretending to have $200,000 worth of methamphetamines for sale, and planning to steal the money for himself.<br /><br />- Leonard realizes Teddy's plan, and distracts Teddy by throwing his keys in a bush, then he decides that if Teddy is going to be making him chase around John G.'s or James G.'s as long as possible for his own benefit, he's going to chase his own John G.... Teddy himself.  So he writes himself clues about Teddy, by writing \\"Don't believe his lies\\" on the back of his photo, and tattooing his license plate number on his body.  Thus Leonard is plotting revenge again, but not against his wife's murderer as he thinks, but against the guy who's been using him to kill people.<br /><br />- Thus the color scenes begin (unveiled in reverse in the movie) in which Leonard is trying to follow the clues to John G.  Teddy (the John G. Leonard is after) is trying his hardest to throw Leonard off course, and to get him to give up.  He then encounters Natalie, and she finds out that Teddy was involved in her boyfriend (Jimmy Grant, the drug dealer)'s death, and attempts to use Leonard to try and kill Teddy.  She doesn't realize he is already attempting to \\"find\\" him and kill him, as he set himself on this course to begin with (before losing his memory at that moment)<br /><br />- There must be some sort of ability for Leonard to remember things and his memory distorts these things the way he thinks it.  The big clue to this is when he tells Teddy that \\"memory can change the color of a car, it can change the shape of a room\\" and concludes with the true beginning, when Teddy reveals to him that there IS no \\"Sammy Jankis\\" as he thinks... the character he's been talking about throughout the movie was a fraud, and had no wife, whereas the story of his disillusioned wife was actually Leonard's wife, and that Sammy was actually Leonard.<br /><br />Really this was truly a unique film, and spellbinding.  It's so complex, you can't watch it only once.  You learn something new with every viewing.<br /><br />And the film also has a very very dark, grim aspect about it.  Aside from the fact that he can never live a normal life again, he can't trust anything or anyone, and he doesn't even realize he's a murderer, and will never remember that it was he who set himself against Teddy after learning that Teddy had been using him for his own selfish purposes.Grant, the drug dealer)'s death, and attempts to use Leonard to try and kill Teddy.

B000JJRIN4|1.0|I am so disappointed...this has to be the worst material she has ever put out. I love No Doubt and and really loved her first solo cd but this is just silly. \\"Wind It Up\\" is utterly ridiculous as is almost every song on this cd. I am such a big fan of hers and for this junk to come out has really made me doubt her as an artist. Gwen, You Need To Go Back To No Doubt Or Put Out A CD Worth Listening To!!!!!
B000002L9O|4.0|not saying that it is bad at all. this album is the one where i have to look back and say \\"this is a Ramones record, right?\\"  keyboards, metal tinged music? yep, this is the ramones.  maybe it is because im not used to richie ramone. i think this album right here is the bridge between older classic Ramones and the Ramones we would see until Adios Amigos...sure, there is too tough to die, but that album is more comparable to the older classic short fast punk style offerings. anyways, animal boy is worth the purchase.      also, why no stellar packaging with bonus tracks and stories for animal boy or halfway to sanity like the first 8 or the last 4 (captain oi re-issued those)? i mean even if the creative well of the Ramones was undergoing changes that differed from the classics around this time period, they are at least worthy of being re-mastered to fit the rest. i mean this is the period in which i know the least of the Ramones \\"story wise\\" and yeah, they could even pay a little tribute to johnny in the notes like the ones to joey and dee dee in the first 8.    just a thought. great album though. get it cheap if you are expecting a re-issue to pop up.
0373771665|5.0|Of all of Heyer's \\"maiden and the rake\\" books, this is a top favorite.  It is a \\"relationship\\" story, as is \\"Frederica\\", as Heyer tells the story from their unlikely meeting and growing friendship that in the end turns to love.<br /><br />Filled with witty dialogue, superbly drawn sub-characters (both lively and dull), sparkling narrative and suspenseful (but not Gothic) plotting, it is a marvelous read and one of Heyer's best.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I admit that I hadn't been watching this show since it started. I had heard about it, but since it was on the WB, I assumed like many people that it would be teeny-bopper crap. Then, somehow, the first episode magically appeared on my hard drive after season one was over. I watched it and was hooked. I got all the other episodes (they too magically appeared) and I couldn't believe I had almost missed this awesome show. If you were a fan of the X-Files, you will love this show. Not only are the monsters scary, but the complex and emotional relationship between the two brothers is brilliantly played. In particular, Jensen Ackles is a very talented actor. Where the heck has he been hiding, I wonder? This is a show that everyone can enjoy. I'm 27 and I love it, and I bought the Season One DVD (note to Warner Bros. and the MPAA, letting people download tv shows free doesn't hurt DVD sales) and now my mother, who is 49, is absolutely hooked as well. There's just nothing bad about this show. Great writing, great acting, great music. Go ahead and buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I'm amazed that people who give this four or five stars actually know nothing about what good music is. This band does not have actual talent whatsoever (even a few of their songs that show \\"talent\\" in this album pale in comparison to a million other Metal bands). People really need to stop worshipping the dollar and skip this band and other bands who are like them. <br /> <br />Don't bother. Fans who like Slipknot and other bands like them truly don't know what authentic and good music really is.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|I know that some other fans will understand if I say that I was a bit afraid of what I could find in \\"Love\\".  <br /> <br />I had to hear it to shake my fears away and realize something that was obvious considering who was the  producer: it was not a cheap mix of Beatles' songs, it was a ART made out of Beatles' material. No one but George Martin (or maybe me and a just few others...joke!) could have done this. The guy has every song in his head and can easily find the perfect tune or rhythm to match with another.  <br /> <br />After hearing The Beatles music and lyrics for 35 years, the first challenge that came up naturally for me was to identify every bit of song that was used in this compilation. Only later, I started enjoying it.  <br /> <br />I won't come back to this album quite as often as I do with the official (and not so official...) records I own. In fact, hearing this album makes me want to run and hear the original stuff. But it is undeniable that the sensation you will experience provided by the technology used to remaster the original tapes will leave you overjoyed. It makes me wonder how long will it take until the whole discography is released on 5.1... or on whatever comes up in sound technology! <br /> <br />It is great that George Martin had decided to include not only their greatest hits but some of their less known songs as well.  <br /> <br />Long live The Beatles, as they are!
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Truly amazing & inspiring!I'm not a big AA fan but this cd blew me away.BATHORY & THERION are good also,but this is a MUST LISTEN for fans of the genre. <br />From a cultural perspective,this definately deserves a listen to.We(German,Nordic,Celtic)need to reflect on our heritage once and a while and AA transforms & transports <br />us back to a time of our ancestors.I think a lot of people in our culture can't figure out what they want to be,because they don't even know who they are,what they are or where they are from! <br />Who knows,\\"With Oden on Our Side\\"we can't go wrong! <br />
B000ION79Y|1.0|The worse Steven Seagal I have tried to watch.  I have every one of his movies, have put up with loose shirts, etc. but dubbing his voice really agravated me.  He has a destintive voice and when it is dubbed you know it.  This doesn't even deserve a 1 star.
B000002U9Y|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Pink Floyd, they did some great stuff both before and after Syd's untimely departure. But this has got to be one of their weaker records - they sort of drifted for a couple years after Syd left, then rebounded with Meddle and, more importantly, the Dark Side of the Moon. And there are a couple of really BAD songs here: the title track is certainly different, but not the kind of thing I'd listen to all that often. Coropal Clegg is noteworthy only for being Floyd's first war protest, because it's an annoying song outside of that. And Daisy Chain hasn't aged well.<br /><br />But there are a couple good songs: Let There Be More Light is a great tune, although the lyrics are just banal hippiedom - reminds me of Cream's Deserted Cities of the Heart, also a kickass tune with stupid lyrics. Remember a Day is underrated, a pretty little folksy song. Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun is a moody masterpiece, kind of like a proto-Echoes. And Jugband Blues is more of Syd's unhinged lunacy, probably my favorite song on the album.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is one trippy album. I guess it makes sense, considering Syd Barrett was on acid and god-knows<br />what-else at the time. Sometimes it's too trippy - \\"Flaming\\"? \\"Pow R Toc H\\"? Roger Water's awful<br />\\"Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk\\"? Get 'em out of here, man! And replace 'em with more of the goods: proto-space rockers \\"Astronomy Domin\\" and the insane instrumental \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\"; the wonderful surf-rocker \\"Lucifer Sam\\"; amazing pieces of psychedelia such as the closing freak-out \\"Bike\\"; folk-rockers like \\"Matilda Mother\\"; \\"The Gnome\\" and \\"Scarecrow\\". Yeah, it's got variety - much more than some of the group's later albums, even. Its childlike sense of whimsy is intriguing, if a bit naïve, and its lighthearted humor is refreshing. It's odd, it's forward-thinking, it's eclectic, it's funny... what's not to like? Shame this was Barrett's final album with the group...

B00000JSJC|5.0|When i say this it's ahead of it's time, i mean that the movie's technology is ahead of it's time.  What i like is that the technology doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility in the near future.  It might have had the years off by a mile, but it's not a future that seems impossible in retrospect. <br /> <br />There are some tough scenes for viewers that are rather sensitive, but for the viewers that are willing to continue the journey, there is some very interesting movie time devoted to a future that isn't ridiculous to fathom. <br /> <br />The movie presents a futuristic \\"drug\\" that actually makes sense, and revolves a plot around a drug that makes you want to feel what it's like to be in someone elses shoes.  The twists in the movie might not surprise those that are now used to expecting twists in films, but the movie still has a way of keeping you absorbed it the atmosphere that it has created. <br /> <br />In my opinion, what drives me with this movie is the world that it creates, and what the characters do with it.  That makes it very interesting to me.  The circumstances combined with the world that the movie created makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br />This movie has it's tough moments to watch, but i admire it's courage to depict what some people would do with the technology that the movie presented.  In my opinion, this is just the kind of movie that could be used as an inspiration for a future filmmaker that would love to tackle that near-future distopia. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I gave this film five stars because this is a long time coming.  Donner's II differs quite a bit from the Lester recut and it shows in a variety of places.  The tone of II (Donner) is significantly darker with an almost grim personality that was a stark contrast to Superman I's light style.  Let's compare some of the differences. <br />  The beginning was a 2006 cut with added footage from Superman I integrated with the effects of 2006.  It looks great but drags a bit and Lester's idea of incorporating it in the title sequence is a better choice.   <br />  In this cut we see the rocket ship from I destroying the phantom zone and releasing the villains.  This was the original idea until the film's (part I & II) format were changed which is why Lester cut it as well.  As the film begins, we have the Lois and Clark bantering over identity crisis.  Again nicely done but Lester's Paris sequence was also quite impressive as well.  So far both interesting.  However the Luther scenes are much darker and more sinister especially when integrated with Brando.  The Lois/Clark scenes at the falls are also nice but Lester's cut also works decently including the falls sequence.   <br />  What really changes is when Clark gives us being Superman.  This cut makes more sense.  To love another person means sacrifice and giving up something.  While the acting from Reeves is a bit rough I liked this sequence better.   <br />   Ah the secret answered.  How did he get his powers back.  The Lester cut leaving it as a mystery was quite effective.  However this is one time where the Jorel/Reeves scenes are a bit expositional and needed a bit more rewrite.  I suspect Donner would have done it if time allowed.  It's a very powerful scene for the father to give up his existence to save the son.   <br />  The battle scenes are much richer in this cut as Zod and Ursa are much darker and more terrifying without the silly camp humor of Lester.  Zod with the machine gun is quite gritty.  Unfortunately they never added the bullet bouncing effects so it looks unfinished.   <br />  The ending scenes also are very different with Superman and Lois saying their goodbyes which is very touching.  Superman also turning back time has been commented on as being redundant but the history is not taken into account.  The time travel in Superman I was added to make the film complete vs. a cliff hanger.  That is why it repeats in II and it's significantly more grim and spooky compared to I and it works really, really well.  The ending scene is nice but it's too bad Superman/Clark didn't have a sad ending coming to terms with the fact that Lois was no longer in his life.   <br />  So which is better?  It's hard to say since Donner's cut is rough and incomplete and it's not his fault.  One scene is even a screen test since it was never shot so we have to have mercy.  Also William's never scored the film so we have sound from the first film and it feels rough and incomplete.  Perhaps the best way is to say that now that I've seen both films I have more respect for Lester as a director as he did have more care for the film than I expected and I understand some of the choices he made but some were terrible.  The camp in the battle scenes was unneeded.  Destroying Mount Rushmore was silly and unneeded as was the small town scenes with the army which felt confined and lacked the big-screen feel.  So here is my verdict Lester (C+) for his choices but he still butchered the film.  Donner (B+) with an (A+) if he was allowed to finish it.  We'll never know for sure what would have happened but it's obvious that Donner's vision was a disasterous choice to squash.  He would have made Superman III and IV and made one hell of a series of films.  Since that never happened we have II, incomplete, rough but still better than the alternative. <br />
0780622553|5.0|Personally, John Grobowski is a bitter, pretentious film geek that thought too long for reasons to dislike this film.  He's heard too many bitter opinions from people that want to make films, but couldn't - and he may be one of these people.  I went to film school too and have heard too many excuses for why good films aren't good enough for their tastes. <br /> <br />In my honest opinion, this is a flick that will impress those that will let it.  It presents a world that appears recognizable, yet doesn't at the same time.  It presents characters that should follow a sterotype, but don't.  It presents elements you've seen in other films, but in a different ideal.   <br /> <br />Yes, I've seen the movies that may have inspired this film, but that doesn't mean that this movie doesn't have a different motivation.  In the opinion of of a casual movie fanatic (If that makes some sort of sense), this is a movie that deserves at least one viewing from even the most casual of viewers.  For me, it's easy to understand how this movie can have a rather large cult following.  This movie is a breath of fresh air for sci-fi fans that haven't seen anything noteworty in quit some time.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I am a huge James Taylor fan.  For people that know me it usually surprises folks that I go on about JT music when presented with the opportunity because  the style is a little outside what I usually listen to.  Nonetheless, I saw that this Christmas album was out and didn't buy it because I somehow didn't think that JT doing Christmas music would appeal to me in any way. <br /> <br />Last week my boyfriend gifted me with the CD.  So I opened it and listened and I've played it over and over again since.  It's so hard to find really good and interesting Christmas music that doesn't sound like the 50 people who have recorded that same song before you, but James Taylor has an incredible ability to take some of these classics that we've heard so many times before that we try to block them out and really make them his own.   <br /> <br />\\"Go Tell It On the Mountain\\" is a refreshing new spin on this tune and has some very subtle references in the chord progression and vocals to \\"Home By Another Way\\" on the Never Die Young album.  \\"Home By Another Way\\" was another reference to the same story, of course, but one told from the JT angle...anyhow..when I go on about this my boyfriend gets all glassy-eyed and just nods at me blankly.  Bottom line is I loved it.   <br /> <br />The whole album is great, very relaxing and very James Taylor.  A perfect album to put on during the stressful holiday planning, decoration, cleaning, etc to keep you relaxed and smiling. :-)

I could not put it down because I found it fascinating on so many different levels. <br /> <br />I learned a lot about the perspective of a person who has Autism. I also noticed the similarities of a person with Autism and ADHD which I had not been aware of before. <br /> <br />The best part was that it was just a really great story that kept me in suspense.

B00005JPAD|4.0|Although not necessarily liked by critics and movie-goers, Martin Scorsese's The Aviator, about the rise and fall of Howard Hughes, was an exceptionally well-crafted film, beautifully acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, depicting a dramatic and interesting time in American history. Martin does a wonderful job with the \\"Historical Film\\"; however his ability to depict the reality of the organized crime culture in America has never been surpassed apart from the Godfather Trilogy. In The Departed, he returns to what he does best, with a superb cast: Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Walberg etc. If you like gangster films, this story is a good one that rivets one's attention throughout its 150 minutes.<br /><br />Nicholson as the aging Irish crime boss in Boston should win or at least be nominated for the Academy award. His narration at the film's beginning pulls the viewer in, describing his philosophy on survival and life. He is a character that knows what he wants and will go to any lengths to attain his desires. He is an expert manipulator that thinks ahead, nurturing the young boys in his neighbourhood to work for him as they grow into men.<br /><br />One of The Departure's major themes is a social paradox: the Matt Damon character is smart and ambitious, rising to the top of the Boston police force. On the other hand, the DiCaprio character has had it tough, scraping to survive, on the surface a \\"loser\\", and the paradox is this: one would assume the \\"successful\\" character to be `good', while the loser falling into crime. In fact, it is the \\"loser\\" who has integrity while the winner is a two-faced scumbag.<br /><br />Similar to all Scorsese films, the soundtrack is cool and the editing is extremely tight, working in tandem towards a striking effect.<br /><br />The film's violence comes off as very real, (too much violence, really) but truly depicts the culture of this underground world.<br /><br />The Departure's plot moves very fast and one needs to pay attention as to who is the \\"rat\\" and what will the Nicholson character do next. Some have said that the plot is too convoluted, too many twist and turns, moving in too many directions to follow. I disagree because the story is clearly told though moves at a lightning pace.<br /><br />The Departure is a quality film, well acted, well produced and the direction and editing top notch.<br /><br />Clearly a four to five star film.ion as to who is the \\"rat\\" and what will the Nicholson character do next.

B000B5XOYI|4.0|Ok....even though I used that title I agree with some.....<br /><br />Batman Forever and Batman & Robin weren't as good as the first 2 Tim Burton flix.<br /><br />BUT..........<br /><br />It's Batman. Plain and simple. The acting was good. A bit over the top and \\"cartoony\\" under J.S.'s direction but the actors can't be blamed. Joel envisioned it that way. He didn't know the characters as well as Tim.<br /><br />Clooney has been known to say that he had a hand in ruining the franchise. I disagree. George did a great job. He had the feel, look, heart and drive of Bruce Wayne/Batman.<br /><br />Val did as well. Both men did excellent jobs with what they had to play with. I honestly believe that the \\"failure\\" of these movies was due to Schumacher's loss of vision of who The Batman really is. He looked at The Batman as a cartoon. If you're doing Spongebob Squarepants that's fine. But The Batman is dark, determined and won't let anything stop him from achieving his goal. The J.S. movies felt fake and limited.<br /><br />The loss of Danny Elfman's music also added to the decline. Goldenthal is good.....but let's face facts....he's no Elfman. Danny has the gut feeling for the characters and the chops to bring everything he touches into a different world.<br /><br />The main difference is the direction. Tim Burton is the man! Everything he touches turns to gold. He's great. We know it. His vision and integrity is what Hollywood should be all about.<br /><br />All this being said I think, overall that the set deserves a good rating. It's nicely packaged and has a quality about it that will keep any fan interested.<br /><br />Also.......<br /><br />Check out BATMAN BEGINS! A new twist.....a new vision.....different, fresh....and right on the spot!<br /><br />PJK

B000JK8OYU|5.0|(Taken from reviews originally  written in the 1960's by Tony Palmer, John Mendelsohn and William Mann)                                                                  Compiled, rearranged and enhanced by Me                                                                                                                \\"If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney along with George Harrison  are the greatest songwriters since Schubert, then today - with the publication of the Beatles new double LP- should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making, which only the ignorant will not hear and only the deaf  will not acknowledge. Called simply Love, it's wrapped in a bright yellow cover which is adorned with  the song titles and those four red silhouettes, silhouettes which for some still represent the menace of long haired youth, for others the great hope of a cultural renaissance and for others the desperate, apparently endless struggle against cynical so-called betters.             \\"Come Together\\" is John Lennon very nearly at the peak of his form; twisted, freely-associative, punful lyrically, pinched and somehow a little smug vocally. Breathtakingly recorded (as is the whole album), with a perfect little high-hat-tom-tom run by Ringo providing a clever semi-colon to those eerie shooo-ta's, Timothy Leary's campaign song is placed near the end of the album  in grand fashion indeed.           George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his \\"Something,\\" some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it.            \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" lead us from there into a dreamy John number, \\"Gnik Nus,\\" in which wefind him singing for the Italian market, words like amore and felice giving us some clue as to the feel of this reminiscent-of-\\"In My Room\\" ballad sung backwards.           George Harrison's \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" carries the manner of Indian music farther into pop than ever before though the tune of the song is recognizably mixolydian; there are hints of Indian atmosphere in some of the other songs (mostly by Lennon and McCartney.)            Psychedelia can be diagnosed in the fanciful lyric and intriguing asymmetrical music of \\"Lucy In The Sky,\\" as well as in the sound effects of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", and the hurricane glissandi of \\"A Day In The Life\\" which has been banned by the BBC for its ambivalent references to drug taking-though if anything on the record is going to encourage dope it is surely the \\"tangerine trees and marmalade skies\\"  and the  \\"girl with kaleidoscope eyes\\" in \\"Lucy In The Sky\\" which contains none of these woosh noises.                That the Beatles can unify seemingly countless musical fragments and lyrical doodlings into a uniformly wonderful suite, as they've done on side two, seems potent testimony that no, they've far from lost it, and no, they haven't stopped trying.            No, on the contrary, they've achieved here the closest thing yet to Beatles freeform, fusing more diverse intriguing musical and lyrical ideas into a piece that amounts to far more than the sum of those ideas. \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" for example, would come off as quite mediocre on its own, but just watch how John and especially Paul build on its mood of perky childlike wonder. Like here, in \\"Because,\\" is this child, or someone with a child's innocence, having his mind blown by the most obvious natural phenomena, like the blueness of the sky. Amidst, mind you, beautiful and intricate harmonies, the like of which the Beatles have not attempted since \\"Free As A Bird.\\"            Then, just for a moment, we're into Ringo's \\"Octopus'sGarden,\\" which seems like a daydream of an underwater fantasy. Allowed to remain pensive only for an instant, we're next transported, via Paul's \\"Lady Madonna\\" with boogie-woogie piano in this happy paean to the glories of motherhood: \\"Lady Madonna, Children at your feet, wonder how you manage to make ends meet...\\"                        And then, before we know what's happened, we're into George's melancholy  \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" a gentle ballad on par with the greatest of the Lennon/ McCartney songbook.  A perfect epitaph for our visit to the world of Beatle daydreams: \\"I look at the world and I notice it turning...\\" And just for the record, John's going to inform us that  \\"All You Need Is Love\\".           Any of these songs is more genuinely creative than anything currently to be heard on pop radio stations, but in relationship to what other groups have done lately LOVE is chiefly significant as constructive criticism, a sort of pop music master class examining trends and correcting or tidying  up inconsistencies and undisciplined work, here and there suggesting a line worth following. The new exploration is the showband manner of  \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and the \\"Sgt. Pepper's Reprise\\", and its interval song, \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.\\" These three give a certain shape and integrity to the two sides, and if the unity is slightly specious the idea is, I think, new to pop song LPs, which are usually unconnected anthologies,  and it is worth pursuing. Sooner or later some group will take the next logical step and produce an LP which is a pop-song -cycle, a Tin Pan Alley Dichterliebe. Whether or not the remains of Schumann and Heine turn in their graves at this description depends on the artistry of the compiler.            I'd hesitate to say anything's impossible for George and Giles Martin after listening to LOVE  the first thousand times, and the others aren't far behind. To my mind, they're equatable, but still unsurpassed.\\"
B0001L3LUE|3.0|I thought McNamara came across in the this film basically the way I had always thought him to be; a pathetic person with no moral back bone at all. If he indeed had opposed the war in Vietnam I don't understand why he didn't resign, and the answer is that he didn't oppose the war.<br /><br />  Everyone claims McNamara was so bright, but even when he went to Vietnam in 1995 he had to have it explained to him that the Vietnamese were fighting for their independence. Why didn't he know that? I was 25 years old in 1966 and I knew that.<br /><br />  Ho Chi Minh was a young student in Paris at the end of WWI. When President Wilson came to Paris, Minh sent letter to Wilson asking him to help free his country from the French. They wanted their independence. Wilson never replied. Why didn't McNamara know that.<br /><br />  As for McNamara's eleven lessons from his life; no brainers each one. Stuff that one learns the first week in a business education class in high school.<br /><br /> The film added nothing to our knowledge of World War II or the Vietnam War that hasn't been discussed before.<br /><br />  So I came away from the film feeling the McNamara still doesn't know who he is or what he is about....still trapped in the fog of his wars.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you should, and I'm not just recommending* the movie because I like Al Gore and tend to lean toward the left politically. I'm recommending this movie because I care about the environment and there is actual evidence to back up what Al Gore has been saying for years: Global warming does exist.    Speaking about global warming is clearly Al Gore's forte. While some of his campaign speeches back in the 2000 Presidential election had been trite and boring, you can tell global warming is a topic Gore sincerely believes in and cares about because he speaks very passionately about the topic.    In addition to sharing his extensive knowledge about global warming in \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\", Gore's very candid about the disappointments and low times in his life; however, he reiterates that he refuses to give into bitterness and despair. Gore's perseverance and determination is something we can all apply to our lives in some way. For example, after the whole voting fiasco in Florida and the Supreme Court's decision in favor of George W. Bush, Gore states: \\"That was a hard blow, but what do you do? You make the best of it.\\" Gore did make the best of the situation and started giving his slide shows about global warming again.     Thank God, Gore is persistent and continues to speak out about the global warming crisis. He remarks that he thought this story would be \\"compelling enough to get Congress to act\\", that it is \\"frustrating that people don't understand that we're the worst contributor\\" and that he looks for \\"meaningful signs we're going to change\\" while clip after clip is shown of him being shot down through the years as he has appeared before Congress for hearings on global warming. There's even a clip of George Bush, Sr. remarking, \\"This guy wants us up to our necks in owls...this guy is crazy\\" while another politician declares \\"This is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\\"     I don't understand how people can say global warming doesn't exist. The signs are everywhere. Carbon dioxide levels are at the highest they have ever been; glaciers all over the world are disappearing; tornadoes, typhoons, floods and hurricanes are rampant and showing up in places where they never have before, and animals and insects, affected by all of the climate changes are migrating to places at unnatural times or dying off because their natural habitat no longer exists.    During the closing credits of An Inconvenient Truth, \\"I Need to Wake Up\\" by Melissa Etheridge -- a really inspiring, motivating song, by the way --plays and different ways we can change the way we live flash across the screen. A few that jumped out at me are:     Recycle  Use Mass Transit  Vote for Leaders Who Pledge to Solve This Crisis  If They [the leaders] Don't Listen, Run for Congress  Speak Up  Reduce Our Dependence on Foreign Oil  Pray people will find the strength to change    *A recommendation for the movie was first featured on my blog and has been edited for publication here.

0618680004|4.0|Much like Sam Harris in [[ASIN:0393327655 The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason]] or [[ASIN:0307265773 Letter to a Christian Nation]], Richard Dawkins passionately makes a claim for objective atheism. He addresses the common issues for atheism: the notion of god(s), arguments for god's [non]existence, relevance of morality to religion, life & abortion, etc.. He delves into the Darwinian roots of religion & morality (most certainly familiar territory for Dawkins) and makes a very good case for why morality is not necessarily derived from religion. He also demonstrates, a la Harris, how religion has been the prime-mover for most of the evil & wrong-doing in the world. A chapter \\"Childhood, Abuse and Religion\\" strives to raise awareness on the legality/morality of whether children should be freely *labelled* as professing their parents' faith; and how indoctrinating children blindly into religion during their formative years is not, in any way, different from other forms of mental or physical abuse. This is the chapter I found most interesting, and is about the only 'new fodder to chew on'. In comparison, the rest of the book is probably familiar conceptually to those who have atheistic, or anti-creationist, leanings already. Nevertheless, Dawkins' presentation is not to be missed.<br /><br />Dawkins' passionate defense should not be mistaken for fundamentalism on his part. His arguments are rooted in observation, reason, evidence, and inference. His ultimate point is that religion, or a belief in a god, is not merely incorrect - but even deadly to civilization & human existence.<br /><br />There are sections where the tone is pedantic, sometimes arrogant, vitriolic even. Further, one might legitimately wonder if Dawkins is really equipped to write a book on the subject of atheism - having ventured far from his acknowledged expertise of 'cultural Darwinian evolution'; but this very criticism of him, I suspect, would be approved by Dawkins himself! In the end, this book is a philosopher's argument for atheism. It definitely makes for interesting, and often-times witty, reading and drives one to REALLY think.is book is a philosopher's argument for atheism.

0743289412|3.0|Usually I don't reveiew a book before I've completed reading it.  But, since Im here and the subject of Stephen King's new novel came up.  I'm gonna give a little insight.  First off, this was not a highly anticipated book for me.  I read the handwritten blurb of it at the end of Cell, and I gotta tell ya, it was't like waitng for IT to come out!  C'mon.  All the reveiws I've read praise King for the newness of his tender side, citing Lisey's Story as primarily a love story.  Well, Stephen is in typical form here, bouncing around the point and drawing out some pretty tame stuff.  The whole scene where Scott is shot at the ground-breaking ceremony is so frigging spun out that the story started to remind me of King's elongated novella The Sun Dog.  Get to the point, Steve, then move forward.  So far I'm only a hundred and fifty pages in and boy is it slow moving.  Like the abortion that was Cell, I know I'm going to have to cleanse myself after finishing Lisey's Story by reading something worthwhile from King like Firestarter or IT.  All  I can say is that every time  have to force my way through a King novel (Gerald's Game, Rose Madder, Desperation....)it's not a good thing.  I'm still waiting for something to make me still believe that King is my favorite author of all time.  Oh, he is, but sometimes he's really, really, really pushing it!<br /><br />Deal With It
B000IFQLLY|1.0|Depeche Mode released two greatest hits albums a couple years back. They were good and very complete. They have only released two studio albums since then and not even all of the singles from those albums appear on this collection. The \\"new\\" song is just a leftover from last years album. Terrible.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Much of Superman II was filmed simultaneously with the first movie. The original plan was to have Superman I end with a cliffhanger: The nuclear missile that Lex Luthor sent to Hackensack New Jersey, which Superman diverted into outer space, explodes, shattering the Phantom Zone and setting the three Kryptonian criminals free. Then the action would freeze-frame, and the screen would flash with \\"Next Year: Superman II.\\"<br /><br />Time constraints and studio politics put an end to that scenario. As the first movie was hastily completed to meet the release date, Superman II was put on hold. Then, director Richard Donner was fired, and replaced with Richard Lester. Even though 70% of the second film was complete, much of Donner's footage was reshot by Lester.  In the Lester cut, about 30% of the footage was Donner's.  While entertaining, the movie lacked the epic scope of the first film, and was far less memorable.  After years of pleading by fans, Warner Brothers has finally issued an approximation of what Donner's version of Superman II would have looked like.<br /><br />The result is a markedly different film, about 50% different, in fact.  Donner's version of II is certainly more epic and dramatic than Lester's version.  The Kryptonian villains are truly menacing here, and the Metropolis battle has more punch.  It also lacks much of the campy, cheesy humor of the 1981 version.  Especially welcome is the return of Marlon Brando as Jor-El.  His performance, though brief, ties this film to the first one and gives it more depth.<br /><br />There are, of course, limitations to what could be done in this restoration.  Some footage is missing, some of the actors have died.  Despite the improved editorial balance, the Donner version has some problematic loopholes, especially the ending, which rehashes elements from the first film and creates a major causality problem.

B000GFLE86|3.0|I remain devoted to her previous album, Careless Love.  This new effort is okay, but so slavishly faithful to that Peyrouvian sound that at the start of each of the first two songs I literally had to go back and check to be sure I wasn't listening to the first album.  It varies somewhat after that, although you sure couldn't accuse it of taking any chances.
0060723513|5.0|I read this book about 8 years ago, and still use it's teachings on a daily basis to reinforce my life and practices today. <br />The author writes earnestly and succinctly, yet with humor,  clean humor, that lasts beyond time. This book has given me infinite hope for healing. <br /> <br />The reading is very light and entertaining, and a great read for anyone; yet, it is one of the deepest books I have read with the depth depending on where the individual chooses to be in their emotional,mental, spiritual, intellectual, and physical journeys, and have referenced it frequently. <br />For those who are journeying with an open mind, reservation of judgement, willingness to consider to think 'outside the box'of their own belief system and willing to consider to be honest with self, and find question in why we are faced with such universal conflict, stemming all the way from that within, where it originates, to that reflected outward, this book holds many incredable, simple, answers, and is a great, light, enjoyable read!!!!! One of the 2 best I have ever read, maybe the best. <br /> <br />I am a physician, very aware of all the suffering in our culture and world, and frankly very saddened to see that the key to true healing still has not been adequately addressed in our medical schools or ongoing continuing educations, yet we continue to skirt 'the truth' with permitting ourselves to 'stay busy' with the distractions of learning 'new drugs, diagnostics, research standards,treatments and mandates to keep us from truly wondering and reflecting address the key to true healing, are we really 'first doing no harm', or are we acting as automotons just 'trying to keep up with mandates and the 'new standards of cares'?  <br /> What is true healing, and are we fulfilling our role and dreams to facilitate true healing in our patients, and ourselves, so we/they become more able to do the same with/for others, or are we stuck on the viscious wheel of 'just keeping up' with testingand mandates and 'standards', and frankly completely missing the boat as the morbitity and mortality of humankind skyrockets malignantly out of control, albiet with apparently 'different' diseases than those of the past, far beyond plagues of our past that were at least treatable with now resistent drugs, obsolete diagnostics, while many of us ourselves have forgotten the true key to true healing, and the 'art' of healing, or just frankly do not have the 'time and energy' to do that for which most of us went into medicine, with all the other mandates we have permitted to be placed upon us.  Have we given all/most of our 'power' away by believing what we are being forced to believe and learn, just to keep up and stay secure, at the expence of true healing of life?  <br /> I did not go into medicine 'just to keep up', but to really make a positive difference in the lives of others, and this book has been THE key to give me the hope to help guide others to/thru their healing process. <br /> <br />This  book gave me the permission to know there was a mechanism to true, often spontaneous healing, and it often and most frequently is not in the form of a 'pill' or diagnostic test or physical treatment.   <br />But it takes first responsibility of the true healer, the individual healing, what we call 'the patient', not the practioner (who simply may facilitate)to honestly look at their own stuff, often sadly out of desparation, then the work to work thru their own stuff, so 'all circles have been closed'and true 'spontaneous healing' is attainable.  This requires fortitude, courage, honesty,open-mindedness, perserverance, modesty, respect of self and others, and a critical willingness to disbanding ones own judgements, critiques, and beliefs they were cultured with and grew up with, and which helped them 'get thru' to be where they are.  it really requires either an emotionally mature or very desparate state for one to truly 'get this book', yet it is the greatest, lightest, enjoyable read i have also read.  I have been the 'patient' in need of this healing, I have traveled this journey. <br />  The simple truths in this book appear radical, but occur daily in all our lives, if and only if we choose to see them.  We can't see anything we do not choose to see,hear anything said that is unheard, we look away physically, emotionally, intellectually, etc.  and honesty and willingness OF OURSELVES is key in this choice making. <br /> <br /> I have traveled all the above journeys. I have been in judgement of the person I have become, and thought the person I am now is 'nuts'. Yet there is a HUGE DIFFERENCE: I can have compassion for the person I was (and all those similarly), who could not see past all my judgements to truly learn and thus heal, instead of be in judgement of the person I was, as that would make me no better than the one I was 10 years ago, as a stuffed shirt, knowing the latest, greatest, diagnostic drug or test,yet being totally miserable down to the core of my soul, just knowing, JUST KNOWING, SOMEHOW, SOMETHING WAS MISSING TO MY 'ART OF HEALING'.  Now i have many of the answers. <br /> <br />Western medicine has a very vital role,and cannot and should not be ignored,overlooked, disregarded, minimized or disbanded, in any way, that is not the intent in any way of my writing.  It is very important, as well.  I am simply saying there are alternatives if we choose see and explore, and this book lightly addresses many aspects to key vital areas. <br /> <br />Thank you, Marlo, you have changed my life and give me the courage to continue to work with individuals every day in a new way empowering them with true tools they can continue to use no matter how the times change or how fast they are changing.  I now understand why I became a physician, and your writing this book was key and instrumental in my holistic and alternative pathway i now practice (although I must admit I was the best 'stuffed shirt' at one time, who would call me today a 'goofball'. but today I am happy KNOWING that what I do has beyond life long positive effects.  Your book alone was the pivotal book, and I reference it often and give it away often. <br />Thank you again for the courage to write this book. <br /> <br />A good teacher gives one lots of organized information, but a 'TRUE TEACHER awakens within you that which you already know'!!!!.  This book, whether fiction, or whatever, has been a true teacher for me and many others I have given the book to. <br />Kudos to you Marlo, for the courage to write it.   <br /> <br />

0375704027|5.0|More than 20 years ago,when studying abroad in Brazil,I read A Wild Sheep Chase sent by her. It is not in 1973 but 1983 for me. Returning to Japan, when my friend committed suicide, after I went to his funeral,I went to meet her. I should not meet me that day, although. Then She got married with the other man. Norwegian Wood which I read that time.    Now, in Mexico , South of Border , I live. When going to Mcallen ,a town of the border in Texas , which takes 200 miles' drive from my house , I found Haruki Murakami at the book store. That surprised me why American people read Haruki Murakami. This half year , more than 10 books of Haruki murakami in English, everything I read. To tell the truth ,this Norwegian Wood was not in good impression for me among Murakami books. Now in the book which is translated in English, I have strangely feeling that I like this book best of it . Because these 20 years , it has probably lost many things from me.  Even now I wonder why she went away from me and got married.   What a foolish man you are !  the voice is coming out of the well.     20 years has passed as if I heard the wind sing.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Light Grenades BY FAR is some of Incubus' best work. The lyrics are well thought out, the instrumentals are magnificent and everything just fits together perfectly. I do admit I was a little disappointed at the last album but this one totally makes up for that and more. If you are an Incubus fan as I am, I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this cd...you won't be disappointed.
0743454529|5.0|I have never read any of Jodi Picoult's book.  I had picked this one because of the subject matter.  Thought this would be a great spring board for discussion for our book club.  There is so much to talk about I don't know where to begin.  The characters, the family, the illness, the mother and how she deals with her daughter who has Cancer and the daughter who will she thinks saves her. <br />But the sister, has cancer tells her if she wants it to stop is to have herself medically emancipated thus starts the story.  And a lot more to delve into.  The end is a tear jerker.  What hit me the most is that no one made the decision if you believe in g-d, he did.  If you believe in fate that had something to do with it.  But it left you in tears for quite awhile.  I had a friend who nephew died a couple hours after I read the book so I was still raw from the book.  What even made the book more interesting.  Each chapter had different type in the pages of the different characters.
0060005424|4.0|\\"Lirael\\" is a great continution of \\"Sabriel\\", by Garth Nix. It is set in a chilling world of foresight, necromancers, and the walking dead. Although listed as young adult fantasy, it is complex enough for an adult reader.  <br />It does suffer a bit from a common ailment of sequels: a major villain was defeated in the first book of the series, so now the author has created a Bigger and Badder villain to harass the new generation of heroes. It is not until the end of \\"Lirael\\" that we begin to understand who the villain actually is, so there may yet be a connection with the villain of \\"Sabriel\\".  <br />Generally the characters are well-developed and likeable. Lirael, although prone to some understandable self-pity, is brave and intelligent. Prince Sameth is slightly more annoying, but his fears are also understandable, and based on a traumatic experience he has early on in the book. The reader might occasionally lose patience with him, but will generally be rooting for him to succeed.  <br /> \\"Lirael\\" acts as a set-up for the third book of the trilogy, so there is no real resolution. As a result, you will probably find yourself rushing out to get \\"Abhorsen\\" as soon as you finish.
B000002WU9|5.0|Raekwon's 1995 solo debut \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" is one of the best albums to emerge from the legendary Wu-Tang Clan and even the city of New York. This album is unlike anything you've ever heard or will hear. The whole concept of the album and execution is amazing and has never been duplicated. Lyrically, this album is a departure from the earliest Wu-Tang albums which were heavy in metaphorical raps thick in Asian vocabulary, kung-fu movie samples, and funny references. Instead, this album has a mafioso, gambino style that persists through the whole album. The album has a very cinematic feel. The whole disc has the MCs telling stories of crime, escapes, and dealings all in the name of the mighty dollar bill and surviving. The whole record is so dramatic and effective. Lyrically it is amazing. The metaphors that are throughout the whole album are among the best ever recorded into a microphone. It is full of punchlines and references that'll make you wonder where these guys get this stuff. The storytelling is impeccable, and the chemistry is remarkable. Part of what makes it so great is that it is such a group effort. Although it is certainly Raekwon's show, the guest artists deserve almost as much credit for their contributions. Wu members and affiliates such as Method Man, Cappadonna, and especially Ghostface Killah, as well as outsiders like Nas, make great contributions. Musically this album stays fairly true to the Wu formula, using RZA-produced beats that have heavy strings, drums, and obscure instrumentals that could only turn up on a Wu-Tang record. The kung-fu samples are replaced by mob movie ones. Like the best mob moves, \\"Cuban Linx\\" is dramatic and at times sentimental, despite its usual hilarity. While not the most accessible, stylistically and artistically \\"Cuban Linx\\" is a masterpiece.<br /><br />After the dramatic intro \\"Striving for Perfection\\" the album begins with \\"Knuckleheadz,\\" where Raekwon, Ghostface, and Goldenarms deliver the first of the amazing raps that emerge over the whole record. The piano heavy beat is among the best, simple and excellent. \\"Knowledge God\\" speaks of drug dealings and has a fitting beat. The horn-heavy \\"Criminology\\" has my favorite production on the album, and Ghost and Rae steal the show once again. \\"Incarcerated Scarfaces\\" is a classic, awesome in every sense. \\"Rainy Dayz\\" is another legendary song, using a eerie singing sample to create a creepy song. \\"Guillotine (Swordz)\\" has a perfect Wu beat and is just another standard for the Wu vaults. The next song is a remix to the Wu-Tang classic \\"Can It Be All So Simple\\" from the group's debut album, a great addition to this disc. \\"Ice Water\\" is brilliantly produced and graced with awesome metaphorical lyricism, as is its follower \\"Glaciers of Ice.\\" Nas drops by for a stunning verse on the well titled \\"Verbal Intercourse,\\" and Ghost and Raekwon collaborate well again on \\"Wisdom Body.\\" The hardcore \\"Ice Cream\\" and the lengthy \\"Wu-Gambinos\\" follow. My favorite song is \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" an emotional, heartfelt song about death as well as the life the gambinos live, with a great chorus (\\"What do you believe in, heaven or hell? We don't believe in heaven `cause we livin' in hell...\\"). \\"North Star (Jewels)\\" ends the album perfectly, with a gorgeous beat.<br /><br />This album is hip hop at its most original and finest. Conceptually, this is absolutely brilliant and so focused and unique. This is an album to be spoken of in the same air as Wu-Tang legends like \\"36 Chambers\\" and \\"Liquid Swords.\\" This album is a must-have for any fan of Wu, east coast rap, or 90s hip hop.g raps that emerge over the whole record.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Amazing. From the very first song until the very last. Amazing. Cannot be explained with any other word or phrase, its that good. There best and most matured album yet. So much compassion and feeling in every lyric. keep it up guys no one can stop the greatness <br />
B000J4QWMC|3.0|This was a pretty good film on it's own but it could just as well have been given another title like \\"UNDERCOVER\\", since it really had virtually nothing to do with the Miami Vice franchise.<br /><br />I suppose the studios knew the name MIAMI VICE would help draw crowds, but there is only a passing similarity to the characters and image of the original series.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I loved the last album a lot. And I understand that Stefani is always trying to move forward with new stuff. I appreciate that, and I'm down for the weirdness. But this is just not listenable. It's not worth it. There are only twelve tracks. I don't want to listen to any of them again. She could've done better, and this is a major disappointment. She took this the wrong direction. Try again, Gwen.
B000I5X81A|5.0|\\"In Spanish and Portuguese, escondido means a hidden place. That's the straight definition. But the word often also implies somewhere dark as well as hidden - a sinister locale with the emphasis on sin. This is a post-jazz honky tonk (or roadhouse or juke-joint, etc.). This is the \\"place\\" of The Road to Escondido. The bands in most honky tonks were straightforward - usually a drummer, bass player, one or two guitars, and a singer. Point is, most honky tonk music is direct and raw. J.J. Cale and Eric Clapton guitar fans should love Escondido.\\" Tom Watson<br /><br />Much has been written about the friendship of J.J.Cale and Eric Clapton. This CD clenches it, they are the best of the best. Eric has recorded several of J.J. Cales's songs and made his mark in the record world with \\"Cocaine\\". This CD is a synergistic work that shows that neither has the upper hand. The artistry of both has made the guitar playing of both as perfect as before, and it often blends into one whole. J.J. Cale has written eleven out of the fourteen songs. This is a collection of songs dedicated to Billy Preston whose last recordings are present. Guitars can be heard with such skill and love, Doyle Bramhall II, Derek Trucks, John Mayer, Albert Lee and the acoustic piano of Billy Preston will amaze you,<br /><br />'Danger' rhythm and great guitar and sung solo by Eric Clapton- written by Cale<br /><br />'Heads In Georgia'-slow, bluesy, soul- 'that lonesome ole highway , seems to be our way go down'.<br /><br />'Missing Persons'- sprightly bounce of a serious side- 'That woman used to be mine, but she is a Missing Person'.<br /><br />'When This War Is Over'-country honky-tonk and shuffle- great examples of how two musicians can catch the mood of each other and sing serious words.<br />\\"It will be a better day\\".<br /><br />'Sporting Life Blues'-classy jazz and blues composition-:This night life, this old sporting life is killing me\\".<br /><br />'Dead End Road'-sprightly two-steppin' song-\\"Feel like I'm runnin' a dead end road, and which way am I to go?\\"<br /><br />'It's Easy'-my favorite of all of the songs, but some say it is the \\"requisite sleaze\\" Bouncy rhythm-\\"It's so easy' to get through these times, so easy your love and mine\\"<br /><br />'Hard to Thrill' finger snappin, sultry, slow blues-co-written by Eric Clapton and John Mayer, with John's unique guitar playing.<br /><br />'Anyway the Wind blows'-rhythm of this toe-tappin song. \\"If you don't get loose, if you don't groove. Well, your motor won't make it and your motor won't move. Easy come, easy go. Any way the wind blows\\"<br /><br />'Three Little Girls'-finger-pickin, delicate composition \\"I get all my love from my three little girls\\".<br /><br />'Don't Cry Sister'-reggae twist on the blues. \\"Don't cry sister cry, till be alright in the morning.

Don't cry sister cry, don't do it, don't do it.\\"<br /><br />'Last Will and Testament'-late night at the bar, \\"I'm gonna over sixty, won't be long til I'm nothin' but a ghost, and it is my intent to leave all of my people out of my Last Will and Testament\\".<br /><br />'Who Am I Telling You'-slow, bluesy, \\"It don't take any fool to love you, and you stand out in any crowd. You done got yourself together\\".<br /><br />'Ride the River'- the closer is full of interesting images and a spirit of adventure. The two souls of blues are one.<br /><br />\\"The Road To Escondido has become a real embodiment of Cale's and Clapton's friendship and due to the commonness of the artists' views at music the record is characterised with remarkable harmonies and peace. The same elusive joy for its creators make it easy for each to understand the other and both are doing what they like best of all. Encouraging each other on every track, the musicians have found a common key adding some features to their playing which have never been heard before. From the very beginning tillthe end album The Road To Escondido is a homogeneous flow of amazingly warm songs, offering a lot of feelings by means of little words. \\"  MusicMP3RU<br /><br />All the tracks on this CD are meaningful and full of spirit, blues, jazz and that elusive joy, all of us, and my best friend and I are looking for.

B0000019PA|5.0|This is simply a lo-fi masterpiece.  Its technical imperfections only add to its emotional power.  At times, Jeff Mangum sounds like he's just barely keeping himself under control; at other times, he sings with a curious detachment about scenes of extreme violence (e.g., \\"Your mom would stick a fork into your daddy's shoulder...\\").  The final track is heart-wrenchingly moving.  A work of incredible emotional complexity.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Don't plan to play this one at your Christmas party! Gentle, quiet, wistful - yes- but Merry Christmas this is not.  <br />I really enjoy Sarah's music- but this leaves me thinking the Christmas is a depressing time of the year for her. I am surprised that she chose to lead the sequence with War is Over - without a doubt in my mind the weakest track in every way.  <br />Oh well. Oh well. Oh well. Oh well. Born from the business of Christmas sell!
0743298020|4.0|I almost never review books on Amazon, but I just finished reading \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" and logged onto Amazon to see if Diane Setterfield had written any other books and in the process browsed the existing reviews.  I found that I could agree with neither the positive nor the negative reviews.  A majority of the positive reviews simply fawn over the book without explaining why it is so good.  Many of the reviews are filled with overworked hyperbole.  Many of the negative reviews struck me as so vitriolic that I wonder if the reviewer had forgotten their meds before starting the review.  And so, I decided to write a review.  I'm not going to tell you whether it is a good or a bad book, I'm going to tell you if I liked it or not and why. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book for the following reasons: <br />1.  The plot interested me (see book description if you don't already know the plot). <br />2.  The writing is excellent.  Richly descriptive without being so wordy that I felt like skimming paragraphs. <br />3.  I found the characters interesting, believable and well-developed. <br />4.  The pacing of the story was just how I like it in a book of this genre.  Slightly meandering with a steady rise and fall of tempo.  This gives me plenty of exciting reading, but also allows me places to stop reading when I need to go to bed or do something else. <br /> <br />Is this book great literature?  Hell, I don't know and don't care.  I enjoyed reading it and that's what reading is all about for me.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|There is no other musical voice today that speaks such one world magic as Loreena McKennitt in her recent release of Ancient Muse. As a long time fan, I was excited to finally hear her long awaited follow up to The Book of Secrets. Amazing! She did not disappoint me as I was mesmerized and transported to another place in time. A very Middle Eastern sensitivity is apparent through the veils of lyrics floating amidst the strings and percussion variations. The more you listen to this ...the more you can hear, as poetic visions are felt. Her lyrics and music echoe the voices of the great Sufis and ancient troubadours from another era.<br /><br />Her strengths on this disc are her visionary skills, delicately reflecting the deeper mirrors of the psyche. This is a tapestry of music woven from Celtic, Greek, and Turkish threads. They are ancient elements or divine oracles of truths waiting inside each of us to be experienced. Many times I felt I was somehow elevated into a momentary spiritual portal of revelation. The only down side is I wanted to remain in this state of rapture much longer.<br /><br />Dont let us wait so long dear Loreena, for you are a true visionary. You speak to all of us about human themes of love, home, and the journey of Life no matter what culture we represent. This ancient voice...this Ancient Muse is timeless!
B00003BDXG|5.0|About 10 years ago I got in a heated argument with a co-worker over NBK.  He said the movie had to much random violence with no point.  I tried to explain to him that is precisely one of the many points of this movie.  There are several obvious parallels with real life that are exposed, which makes this a very powerful and profound piece of art.<br />One common problem examined by Stone/Tarrantino is the downfall of the American family.  This issue is prevalent in our country today with all the abusive parents, teen pregnancies, and absent father(and mother)figures.  Maybe today's kids won't grow up to be mass murderers, but many problems can be traced back to a poorly structured childhood.<br />This movie also discusses the public's obsession with violence, which is undeniable.  Gore movies like Hostel or Saw are raking in massive dollars at the box office, plus I've seen quite a few Charles Manson T-shirts and bloody novelties.<br />The movie also makes interesting points about the media and fame.  It questions the absurdity of the american public. (Why is TomKat's wedding front page news)?<br />This film is filled with thought-provoking statements.  Anyone who dislikes it should give it another chance, take a closer look.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I loved the film.  I watched and could not help making the corollary leap to the 1984ish Bush regime and their mindless repetition of the Iraq catch-phrase of the week.  Its a great underdog story and the ending is a bit too stylized but what the heck \\"we the people\\" never seem to win these days!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I received this CD from a friend just before a road trip.  This now comes with me on every road trip, because it is amazing.  I'm sure more eloquent people have provided a better defense of this opinion, but suffice it to say that I loved it, and am eagerly awaiting his new stuff.  Sufjan is a great find.  I specifically like this album better than Michigan, I've learned, but his signature style is always impressive. <br /> <br />Optimistic, warm, and intelligent vibe.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|If you are a fan of any of the Beatles music, you should get this.  It's a reprise of their contributions. This is a remix done with slowing down some songs, speeding up others, and mixing in tracks from one into another song.  It's wonderfully done.    <br /> <br />The only misstep is the addition of the strings on \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\", which the creator of this acknowledges he had created and added on--nice try, glad you tried, but it didn't work. However, that doesn't detract from the overall joy any of you Beatles fans will hear listening to this music.  It's a new, fresh, way of looking at a group that got it right, and this issuance gets it right again.  Very good sound quality.    <br /> <br />One alert to you.  There is no transition between one song and the next, so song 1 fades into 2, 2 into 3, etc.  It's OK but takes a moment getting used to.  The lack of transition does add to the excitement and experience, but it is different.   <br /> <br />As I was listening to this the first time, I knew I had to get it on my iPod and I got it copied over even before I'd heard all the tracks. I've listened to all it now, and you should too. <br /> <br />Basically, as I can explain it, the creators got the original high quality Beatles tapes and spent a lot of time (all worthwhile except for the strings I mentioned which is the one thing they didn't look to the Beatles for but did on their own--hey, thanks for the try, some of you may like it) figuring out how to recombine tunes, slow down some so they have more meaning such as \\"Because\\" (the first cut), speed up others, accentuate parts, and so on.  They did a great job on the great stuff a great group put out. Well worth your $16 if you are a Beatles fan, and even if you aren't but wanna get an idea of how well they could do music.
B00005JPC7|4.0|Put-upon protagonist Harold Crick appears to exist in the same absurdist universe as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's off-center characters in \\"Being John Malkovich\\" and \\"Adaptation\\". It is not Kaufman, however, who penned the creative script here but rather Zach Helm, whose fertile imagination drives this fatalistic 2006 dramedy. Directed with a nice contemporary panache by the increasingly versatile Marc Forster, the fantasy-driven film focuses on Harold's sadly mundane existence as an emotionally unavailable, anal-retentive tax auditor for the IRS.<br /><br />One morning, he hears a particularly erudite voice describe his life with real-time precision and zealous literacy. Harold desperately seeks out the source, first by speaking with the unctuous office psychiatrist and then by eliciting the help of an eccentric literature professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert. It turns out to be the voice of author Karen Eiffel, who has been undergoing writer's block for nearly a decade, a situation alarming enough to her publishing company that they send a foolproof assistant to ensure a final manuscript is delivered. In the meantime, Harold finds himself drawn to a high-spirited, non-conformist bakery owner named Ana in the middle of a testy, confrontational audit. But the more serious problem is that Harold is the main character in Eiffel's nearly completed novel, and she always kills off her heroes in her books.<br /><br />How Helm and Forster resolve this fanciful dilemma is the best part of the movie because they build the far-fetched convolutions toward a satisfying emotional resonance. If the rest of the set-up doesn't reach the dizzying high-wire act of Kaufman's best work, the film still has genuinely clever plot turns and moments of creative momentum. In a reflective seriocomic performance, Will Ferrell proves he has the acting chops to handle the gravity of Harold's dilemma, even if he has to act constrained most of the time. Emma Thompson manages to capture Eiffel's angst-ridden reclusive nature with her familiar sardonic aplomb.<br /><br />As Ana, Maggie Gyllenhaal finally has a role worthy of her ripened, effortlessly coquettish persona. Playing a more deadpan variation of his bumbling sleuth in \\"I Heart Huckabees\\", Dustin Hoffman nicely underplays Hilbert. Queen Latifah has relatively little to do as Eiffel's assistant Penny, but she does it with authority. With this accomplished film, Forster really shows a flair for balancing the whimsical with the tangible that drive Helm's charmingly inventive story.t-ridden reclusive nature with her familiar sardonic aplomb. <br /> <br />As Ana, Maggie Gyllenhaal finally has a role worthy of her ripened, effortlessly coquettish persona.

0395389496|5.0|No longer being a child, and having seen the movie before ever reading Chris Van Allsburg's The Polar Express, I find it somewhat difficult to review this Caldecott Award-winning book.  Never having heard of the book before the movie came out, I had originally assumed that this must be some classic Christmas book from a half-century or more ago, one that had somehow escaped my notice when I was a child.  The story really does read like a traditional classic, which is only one of the reasons I am so fond of it.  I also love the beautiful simplicity of it all, as well as the fact that it helps me remember what Christmas meant to me as a child.<br /><br />To me, The Polar Express actually speaks more eloquently to grown-ups than it does to children - although these visions of Santa and his reindeer, particularly in the ever-so-long days of middle December, are sure to invite smiles and squeals (and, I expect, questions along the lines of \\"why would he choose a bell when he could have had a Playstation 3?\\") from youngsters.  Children will no doubt enjoy this story, but I am not so sure they will truly appreciate it - not until, that is, they have had the misfortune of growing up and losing that precious sense of wonder that defines childhood.  The Polar Express speaks most subtly and powerfully to those of us who can no longer hear the bell.

The good news hopefully is it won't be the last Paul writes.<br /><br />This book cuts to the gut of considering doing things differently without being apprehensive.  And in less time than you could read this whole review backwards you can get through his new book.  I think that's also what makes the books written by Arden interesting.  Their short on paper but long on ideas.  Great for you if you're always complaining about not having enough time to get through a good book.<br /><br />I think the only way to put mileage on an idle mind is to read books that make you say huh! \\"I never thought of it like that\\".  This makes a book well worth the reading.  Benjamin Franklin said in Poor Richard's Almanack...\\"Reading makes a full man--Meditation a profound man--Discourse a clear man.\\"<br /><br />So are you afraid of applying simple rules in the reverse?  Do you often just go with the status quo or follow common patterns or guidelines for thinking?  If you're not afraid to think in the opposite or if the following title with the words backwards doesn't bother you than you may be well on your way to something worth imagining differently.  \\"WHATEVER YOU THINK Think the Opposite\\" is worth your time.<br /><br />The book opens up on page 7 with a Flop...and are you willing to take one and try an idea that goes against reason?<br /><br />In this day and age how willing are you to be unfashionable?  Well get ready to put on your high heeled sneakers as you prepare to take another drastic right turn in a left turn lane which seems to spin out of control on pg 16 & 17 in order to jump-start your thinking about \\"The Height of Unfashion\\" and how taking risk to make a decision that's unfashionable often leads you to the next unpredictable road to greatness.<br /><br />\\"The Age of Unreason\\", and \\"There is no right point of view\\"  both make you think about perspective and how yours could be screwing you up from seeing the things you're missing.  Now if you're not into progressive thinking don't try this book.

B000ASSDVA|3.0|This movie may be more relevant today than ever.  It depicts a time period in our distant past -- the eleventh century -- when Chistians and moderate Muslims (the Moors) were threatened by an invading army of Muslims from the Almoravid dynasty.  I don't know true this movie is to history, but at least some of it is, and it motivated me to read up on that time in history.  I doubt I ever would have done that otherwise.<br /><br />The downside is that this movie is three hours long, and it isn't quite as engaging as I thought it would be given the acting talent involved.  Even Charlton Heston couldn't make this move interesting for me for the first two hours.  He seemed to be overacting.<br /><br />Most of the story is wrapped around El Cid (Heston) falling out of favor with the King, getting back into favor with the King, then trying not to get involved in the rivalry that develops between the King's offspring after the King dies. Then El Cid is exiled, but he is eventually recalled to leadership by troops still loyal to him.<br /><br />The first two hours of this movie seem like a blur of riding horses...fanfare at the King's court...more horses...another fanfare and King's court scene...swashbuckling...more horses...jousting...more fanfare...king...fanfare...horses...fanfare... on and on and on.<br /><br />However, the payoff comes in the final hour when the story moves to Valencia.  Here you see the cast of thousands and one of the great battle scenes I've ever seen in any movie.  So, it was worth the wait.<br /><br />So, it wasn't the engaging epic that I expected, but it was epic, and I suppose there are worse movies to spend three hours on.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An Inconvenient Truth does a great job of putting the whole story of global warming and its ramifications in one place--an inspiring 96-minute film.  Moreover, after seeing the film you will understand why this issue is so important to Al Gore--he was inspired by a college professor and has studied the problem for nearly all of his adult life and has championed the need for action all through his political career--which now appears to be incredible foresight given the mounting body of evidence that global warming is having disastrous effects on every continent and every part of our eco-system.    We all need to act now, before it is too late!!!  Gore notes the positive steps that we can take that are within our grasp to reduce the levels of carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gases back to 1970 levels.    If you have doubt, as I had, about whether the phenomenon and effects of global warming are as significant as they have been portrayed, this movie will remove that doubt.  It all begins to make sense in this movie how the interrelationships of the changes cause serious consequences everywhere on the earth.  And it has causes I would not have even thought possible. I just noticed a news article today about Bark beetles ravaging western US forests--which scientists attribute to warming climate because the region in recent years has not sustained periods of sub-zero temperatures that once dealt a fatal blow to beetle populations.  After seeing the movie, I really believe it--this is just one of the many phenomena that Gore notes during his lecture in the movie.    One other important point that Gore makes is that the scientific community is in agreement about seriousness of the problem.  Politicians and businessmen raising questions about whether there is agreement have a hidden agenda to protect the commercial interests of their constituents and their industries--hence they view global warming as an \\"inconvenient truth\\" which is in their interests to obfuscate.  In doing so, they have created a general misperception in the media that there is disagreement in the scientific community about whether global warming is a significant problem.    This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, both because of the topic and the presentation.  Don't wait to see this--it will change your whole perspective.

I would say tho that the run time listed for the performance must be a mistake as the PBS airing, which excludes some tracks found on the dvd, is exactly the same run time as the dvd, so the dvd must be closer to 90 minutes.  Just a point of information.
B000002UDB|5.0|MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was a dismal failure as a BBC television special, and justly so. In fact, it was so awful the program was never aired in the United States. Unscriptedly ad-lib and haphazard, the film's occasional musical performance highlights couldn't redeem this silly exercise in group personal excess.<br /><br />Conversely, the American record album of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (ironically unavailable in Britain) was a wondrous thing indeed. The entirety and order of its songlist are included on this CD release. Inside the original record's foldout cover were several pages of 12\\" stills taken directly from that strange movie-- these appear here in miniature. The LP and CD also contain the complete song lyrics. Best of all, several Top 40 records that weren't a part of that original TV show were used to flesh out this set.<br /><br />The majority of the songs on this Xmas '67 release received a great deal of American AM radio airplay at the time. No other US Beatles album contained as many chart topping hits as MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. Pretty good for what at the time was considered a letdown for all involved and their fans.<br /><br />In many ways, MMT holds up better than SGT. PEPPER'S. Musically, if not cinematically, this was the Beatles at their height as a cohesive group.
044022165X|4.0|This is a neat little package of a book.  550 pages-odd but a fast, fast read which turns the screw nicely.  Grisham is excellent - I'm sure he knows he is - but in a sense, with so many great books under his belt, I wonder if that doesn't leave him with a desire to tie-up too many loose ends in the last chapter or so.  I felt that some of the last few swings were a little too convenient and so, much as I cannot believe I have the audacity to give Mr Grisham only four stars, that is what I am going to give him.  I think more flags earlier on in the story would have given it five, but the quick spurt to the end - common in a number of books - is possibly a failing of an editor, not necessarily Grisham himself? I wonder if he reads these reviews?

B000AP04MO|5.0|Two for The Road is a true sixties comedydrama in every sense of the word. It is also one of the best roadmovies up to date. It is a funny, dramatic and an absolute pleasure to watch that will stay in your mind for some time.  <br />Starring the lovely Audrey Hepburn and the funny Albert Finney, the story follows a married couple who's flame of relationship has burnt out. The marriage is on the rocks while flashbacks show how their relationship began while both were travelling through Europe.  <br />The director, Stanley Donen (who also directed Hepburn in Funny Face (1956) and in Charade (1963)) has made a film that is a true masterpiece. The way the movie is cut and edited is absolutely fasenating and makes the film very great to watch. You will be swinging around from one situation to the next in absolute joy. The characters are great, the situations fun and the romance is delicious. Next to those comedic moments there is also a chunk of drama in the film. It fits perfectly and doesn't feel like it is unnecessary next to the comedy, which is another element that makes the film wortwhile to take a look at. The film is ballanced just fine and isn't hanging too much in one direction.      <br /> <br />Considering artdirection the movie is true eyecandy. Beautiful, colorful locations are seen throughout the film with an even more beautiful Audrey Hepburn. This film made her the true fashion icon of the sixties. She is prefectly dressed in every single scene and made women all over the world want to be like her even more. Her acting is once again grand, you just can't go wrong with Hepburn. You'll be charmed and enchanted by her looks, personality and that big shiney smile. <br />Albert Finney plays Hepburn's husband, a fun role. He acts great and makes you love him or hate him in the various situations. He is believable even though he is pushing his performance to the beginning of  being unbelievable, which brings great fun to watch and a memorable performance. <br /> <br />The music of the famous Henri Manchini (Breakfast at Tiffany's, Charade, The Pink Panter) is beautiful and fits the film perfectly. Emotions are made stronger, situations are made funnier and even more romantic then they already are by this fasenating soundtrack. The main theme will be playing in your mind for some time after seeying this film.  <br /> <br />So the film is a true enjoyment for both eye and ear. It entertains you, wether by the story, locations, music, that lovely Audrey Hepburn or that funny Albert Finney. It wants you to travel with them and long to the sixties.  <br />Two for the Road is a masterpiece that will leave you with that smile on your face that you want to have when looking for entertainment.    <br />

I've learned so much from this book and I'm glad I read it.  I would recommend it to anyone: if you are an atheist, read it to strengthen your views; if you are a theist, read it to test your faith and learn about a separate (albeit more correct :-P) perspective.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|This movie is nothing phenominal but it delivers EXACTLY what it promises. Gratuitous gore, nudity, and B-Movie level acting. This isn't going to breach my top horror lists, but it's definitely one of the better horror flicks of the 21st century and worth at least checking out.  <br /> <br />Cons: The gore effects are fairly decent but coulda been better, the characters aren't really all that likeable, and the plot was kinda flawed. <br />Pros: The idea behind a place where you can pay to kill people gives a disturbing viewpoint of all of society being one's enemy (there's no ONE villian in this movie but several), the women throughout are gorgeous (not really all that relevant but a plus nonetheless) and I although some of the characters are cliched, the order of their deaths and how gruesome the deaths are aren't cliched. <br /> <br />Overall I enjoyed this movie; it's a good B-Level flick. It was entertaining and it gave me an eerie outlook on Hostels which certainly made this movie memorable enough to think of it everytime I go to Europe and stay in a hostel (which I surprisingly do quite often.)  <br />3.5/5
B00005JPCD|4.0|I avoid writing reviews.  I say that only to qualify my input here.  I took my young daughter to see this film, both of us rather eager to view it, and, as suggested in the reviews, I enjoyed it more than her.  I have taken her to many of the animated flicks in the past year and this is the only one that she asked to leave before it had ended.  Funny thing is, I soaked it up.   <br /> <br />The film on every level has an adult theme.  There are some kid graphics, some kid dances, some things to entertain a kid, but this is NOT a kid's movie.  The music was retro enough to make us parents connect.  Though, the music and dance was not at all overbearing - it was not a cheesy musical.  An adult is going to connect to the music of the picture emotionally, thus, in some measure, endearing us too it.  The kid, though they may like the beat, does not make that emotional connection.  But the music is not central, then, interestingly, nothing seems to be. <br /> <br />This film was made to entertain.  It was not, so far as I can tell, a propogand film.  I can certainly see where one might derive that from, but I do not think that was the intention, I think it was added to increase interest.  I am a Christian and an environmentalist, whatever the latter means, and today, whatever the former means.  However, I differentiate from evangelicals, though I am one, in that, I hesitate to be reactionary and my Libertarianism tempers my moral indignation.  Not that I should be libertarian if it were not philosophically consistant with my given worldview, but I think it is, thus I am, thus, I welcome folks poking fun of convention or the conviction that convention must be preserved.   <br /> <br />I agree with the viewer that the movie, if it has worldview intentions, must be more anti-catholic more than anti-Christian.  Evangelicals are so varied, some dance with their feet, some sing with their tongue, some neither analogously speaking, that one could hardly use the old penguin characters to parody American evanglicalism.  Catholicism being centrally controlled and unified, if a different matter, though a matter that one often attacks at their own peril when they using hyperbole.  Because the little flapping man was different does not make him gay, it merely makes him different.  You can say that color creates beauty without having to pass moral judgement on what colors are right or not.  Because the old penguin cracks down on the side of conservatism and was protrayed as resisting the rational social evolution, does not mean that all conservative sentiments are wrong, it merely prods conservatives to avoid being close minded.  There are many things that must be sinful, but certainly one of those is close-mindedness.  Likewise, openmindedness as the irrational portray it (the both and logic camp) is sewage.  The closed mind is dogmatic, the open mind is worthless.  One should be open at all times while always closing in on certaintly.  One should be able to mock the accepted order while respecting the ways that protect the human disposistion.  In short, because one attacks close-minded conservatism as this film does, does not imply that \\"conservatism\\" is wrong, nor that Christianity is wrong.  If they are saying that reason and religion are not compatible, they are wrong, so what.  The Pope was in trouble lately for saying that religion and reason were handmadens and that Islam refused to admit the devise of reason to its canon, thus, well, thus . . . infer it!  The religious should be reasonable!  Alas, they are often not, which is why evangelicals make such a perfect target.  <br /> <br />On the charge of environmentalism . . . the film stated fact.  When mankind overconsumes and distorts the natural order, something is going to suffer.  You can say, Man rules supreme (there is a claim there speaking in Darwininian terms) so to heck if we hurt the natural order.  And if this is your claim, then this film might cause offense.  If you reasonably understand that there is a cause and effect to everything, you can accept the FACT that if we overfish the southern sea, southern wildlife, dependant on fish, will suffer.  That is NOT hyperbole to make a point, it is merely a point!  A point that is factual.  Mind you, I am not deciding here whether mankind has the right to rape the planet, I am only suggesting that if he/she elects to do so, some things, many things, including himself, are going to suffer.  This movie used the fact of overfishing as a subtext to give greater meaning and interest to the aspirations of the characters.  That cannot make it a propogandist film!  It makes it a film with an interesting subplot containing real world elements - thus the use of real humans, to create the conviction that the issue is real.  This gives the film more purpose, even if you do not agree with it, the film is more daring and interesting because it takes things to a new animated level.   <br /> <br />This movie is not going to be understood or even enjoyed by the little ones, but any knee jerk reaction accussing it of propaganda is certainly reactionary.  This movie is a one of a kind and should be contemplated by all with openly closed minds.
B00005K3LW|4.0|I thought the first 2 die hard movies were awesome.This one just seemed to get sloppy and rushed after about an hour and a half,up until then it's awesome. parts of the movie were way overexagerated.Like stealing all the gold with 14 dump trucks without the cops realizing there is a bank next to the subway,HELLO! or Mclane looses so much blood towards the end you can fill up two 5 gallon pails worth.And the end is tottaly garbage,no way for a die hard movie to end.the original ending is much better which is on the 2nd disk.there is a part where tanks and other huge machinery are just going through new york like its normal. other stuff to but i wanna get to the good parts.Anyway im not very much for writing long reviews ao i put together the stuff that makes the movie good.<br />1.Harlem scenes<br />2.central park race.<br />3.subway blow up<br />4.bank elevator scene.<br />5.aqueduct scenes<br />6.car chase scenes<br />7.ship and truck cable scenes.<br />then to me it gets really rushed and falls apart.all in all a good die hard movie.Can't wait for the forth installment.due out in 07,another wife beater shirt with blood and dirt on it!
B00005JNS0|5.0|I saw this film twice in two days after my mother in law bought the DVD, and I am likley to buy this myself.  A great film reminiscent of Doc Hollywood, but done nascar style. Lightning Mcqueen is a hot shot rookie racer who gets stranded in a small town after getting scared and tearing up main street after a string of missunderstandings.  After being forced to stay and fix his damange, he grows to like the quaint settings, and it's inhabitents, including the Tow Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy.

0786838655|5.0|This was a fabulous book. My 10 (now 11) year old loved every second of it and I have to say, so did I.  He is a \\"reluctant reader\\" who preferred non-fiction books to anything else.  Now he says he loves fantasy books and it's because of this well-written, funny, exciting, \\"non-stop action with surprising turns on every page\\" book.  We couldn't wait to read what was next every night.  Percy is a character with human flaws that many kids can relate to in this ever-competitive fast-paced world.  My son has been anxiously waiting for the sequel(s) and I sincerely hope the author keeps on writing them and never runs out of interesting ideas!  What a great book.  Truly, this was as interesting for me as it was for him!

B00005JPD0|5.0|Deja Vu, starring Denzel Washington as a federal agent looking into a horrific terrorist attack in New Orleans, is exciting and suspenseful beyond measure.  Five minutes until the end, you still don't know what is going to happen.  In this day and age of audiences being spoon-fed story lines that are way too predictable, this film is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />As we were leaving the theater, we found ourselves discussing \\"But if THIS happened, THEN...\\" type questions.  We started yelling \\"Ow! Ow!  This makes my brain hurt!\\"<br /><br />So there you go.  Deja Vu is a suspenseful adventure, has an intriguing plot, is full of great acting, has huge explosions,  and contains a terrific \\"chase\\" scene (following somebody 4 days in the past on a busy highway is a neat trick).<br /><br />Absolutely worth a second viewing!
B000J4QWMC|1.0|The plot made no sense. Crockett and Tubbs goes undercover in the attempt to find an informant who caused the murder of two FBI agents. For some reason they immediately escalate their undercover work to major drug deals (hundreds of kilos worth) with some South American or Cuban drug lord. To what end its anyone's guess. Quite frankly, there seems to be no purpose to their undercover work. Are they plotting to bring down the drug lord or arrest one of his top lieutenants? Or are they trying to cripple their drug operation? If so how? Neither Crokett nor Tubbs reveal their end goal or how they will attempt go about it but somehow they get continual support from all the law enforcements agencies that are involved (Miami PD, FBI, CIA, Coast Guard, Homeland Security and who knows who else). In the end, Crockett falls for a drug lord (played by Gong Li) and personal sneaks her out of the country so that she can deal drugs another day. You got to be kidding me! And the whole informant story that launched this entire crazy mixed up adventure conveniently gets swept under the rug and forgotten. This movie was terribly conceived. <br />Oh and let me note that Li Gong's performance was horrific. Her fake Spanish accent which turned on and off could not cover her terrible Chinese accent.
B00005JO20|4.0|Ann Darrow is a starving actress who signs on to star in a movie by a maverick film maker. He is taking his crew to a mysterious island to make an over the top film to resurrect his career. When they arrive on the island, the native people capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to it turns out, an enormous gorilla. In trying to rescue Ann, the ship and film crew capture the ape and take him back to New York where the film maker displays him in a Broadway theater, until he escapes his chains and runs amok in New York City. <br /> <br />The movie's writer has fallen in love with Ann. In his fervor to rescue her, he feels nothing but anger toward the great ape. But Ann has fallen in love with the beast and he with her. He has shown her a compassionate, contemplative side. He has risked his life and protected her from other creatures on the island like dinosaurs. When they are back in New York, Ann feels lost being separated from Kong and seeing him as a prisoner. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson's King Kong is a visually spectacular movie. The effects are wonderful. Kong looks like a real gorilla unlike past versions of the great ape. All the scenes with animals and insects on the island are very well done. The movie is also written very well. It moves along nicely and the pace keeps stepping. The sentimentality between Kong and Ann is different from other versions of this film and while it seems odd at first, it works in the end. In fact, it is this love between them that makes Kong's death in the end one of the saddest things I've seen on film. The camera focuses on his eyes, on his feeling for Ann and the life draining out of them. <br /> <br />The only complaint I have about the movie is its length. There are several scenes that go on far too long and so make the movie overlong. All in all though, this is a wonderful movie.

B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie sounded like it might be good but all it ever did was promote raw hatred of Jews, nothing about the positives of having a spiritual relationship.  They beat, stomped, kicked, stabbed, whipped, thirsted, and abused Christ until you couldnt stand watching it another minute, then they would do it ten more minutes.  After about the sixth session of that same scenario you'd rather just walk out than to continue to sit through another beating.  That's what the whole movie was about, more beating, hanging, dragging, etc.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Dear All, <br />      I love the Beatles.  We all know at certain times love songs hurt and we wish we could sail away on the Yellow Subarmine ,our answer being LET IT BE, and we IMAGINE for a day to get better.  We are beyond TRYING TO WORK IT OUT&lt;I DONT SEE IT YOUR WAY etc. This is why I say buy the Beatles from Amazon of course, in the original recordings. Download them to your IPOD or other freiendly MP3 player aand make your own song list or more than one to meat the needs of all of your moods and passions.   You  should hear my 75 song Christmas play list, a marvel and a joy to have. Joy to the world, make your own.  My other playlists all serve a purpose and if I have no purpose I can always hit the shuffle and be suprised!

B00005JPCY|4.0|Good acting.  Good character development.  Denzel Washington.  Breath taking suspense.  Romance.  A pretty girl.  Danger.  New twist on an old theme.  A touch of sci-fi.  A fun chase scene.  Hard to read ending. Good special effects.  A few fights.  A touch of blood.  All blended together for a film worth viewing in a PG-13 format.  So what if it is a little unbelievable, aren't most films?  This film probably won't win any academy awards, but I'll bet it is still watched after some of the academy award winners get dusty.
B000000OQF|1.0|If you buy this album,you'll be sorry you didn't buy DOKKEN or at the least EUROPE.At least both bands can actually write and perform their own songs better than GUNS N ROSES ever could.All GNR'S albums are a total waste of time of screaming,talking about getting some,drugs,alcohol,and the music isn't even great either.Try a RUSH album instead.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I agree with the majority of the reviews praising Illinois. It's a great album: ambitious, innovative, and cool. Not perfect, but five stars in any case. Still, for someone like me who used to live in Illinois, it's hard not notice how conceptually breezy the album is. The lyrics are mostly about Stevens, not Illinois. The historical references promised by the song titles don't get developed; they're window dressing. What does the song \\"Black Hawk War\\" have to do with Indians? What does \\"Chicago\\" have to do with the city? What does \\"Casmire Polaski Day\\" have to do with the holiday? Very little as it turns out. Mary Todd Lincoln? Just a nice illustration on the sleeve. Lyrically, Illinois is little more than a tourist postcard. That is until you come to \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr.\\" This, of all subjects, is the one Illinois figure he chooses to treat in detail.<br /><br />I lived through the Gacy era when I was a kid. He resided in a suburb near where I grew up and I remember those times quite well. Listening to Stevens sing a weepy ballad about Gacy's life is just too much, particularly when he tries to identify with Gacy at the conclusion of the song. Good grief. Stevens comparing his own petty misdeeds as somehow being on par with Gacy's acts is neither heartfelt nor dramatic. It's insincere.<br /><br />Since my first encounter with the song, I've read an interview with Stevens. He explains that he choose Gacy because he felt he needed an antihero for the album. Well okay, but Gacy isn't an antihero, he's a villain. When you write a sympathetic song about a villain with the misguided intent of being touching and insightful, you end up looking like the village idiot. It's a bit like trying to promote sympathy for the creeps that arrested Anne Frank. It doesn't fly.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of native Chicagoans have a similar reaction to the song. It's a weird one alright. But odder still, it appears to be the very song that many young fans are attracted to. I guess because it's the only ballad on the album and the emotional falsetto part seems to make people want to sing it; just take a glance at YouTube. Clueless performers abound, making videos showing off how well they can cover the Gacy song. Each tries to outdo the next with the touching sensitivity of their approach. I saw one featuring two girls at the living room piano performing it as a duet. They look like they ought to be singing some girly Kelly Clarkson love song. Instead, they're singing in earnest tones about dead boys buried in a crawlspace--like it's a perfectly natural thing to be sentimental about. Man that takes the cake.<br /><br />This will probably sound like I dislike the album, but that's not the case. To me, this is an example of just how wrong an otherwise talented composer can get it if he's not careful. I could wax on about how great the album is--that would be easy enough to do. But then, there are plenty of other reviewers doing that. I'm more interested in the friction between success and fiasco contained in a single album that tries so hard to be original. While the Gacy song succeeds in being different, nevertheless, its main effect turns out to simply reveal how scattered the other ideas on the album are. Illinois succeeds, but it does so as a glorious mess with a black spot in the middle.ad on the album and the emotional falsetto part seems to make people want to sing it; just take a glance at YouTube.

0618680004|1.0|Well, I thought I'd add yet another response to this already huge array of commentary... Simply, to disprove God one must define what God is, and thus establish what he is attempting to disprove. The only trouble is, there's no agreed-upon definition of God, so this is not possible! To disprove one definition of God is, obviously, not to disprove them all, and there are fundamentally different ones out there. It goes without saying that Dawkins believes in, at least, SOME concept of God(the one he agreed on in order to disprove it), but really he just seems upset about PEOPLE and human behavior. Dawkins doesn't seem to like those he considers of inferior intelligence having their way in the world. It is unfortunate that God somehow got blamed for all the idiotic behavior and writings that people produce supposedly in His Name. People have probably said all this in the many comments already posted, I am saddened though that Dawkins will probably never understand that all his effort really only amounts to a paycheck and some misguided commentary on web pages. God is an enormous and diverse term and so, to disprove, would require a little more than an irate-sounding scientist's hubris and lust for intellectual \\"I-told-you-so\\" superiority over those who don't think like him. Dawkins will, as the centuries and millenia go by, ultimately and inexorably lose this argument, because he invented all of it(its scope and definitions) in his imagination. For the fun of it, we could pretend to ourselves that one day Dawkins will have won his little tantrum argument. Then what? Absolutely Nothing. People will still blame God for their behavior, both good and bad. I only hope that one day Dawkins sees the limitation of the intellectual process itself and realizes that logic is just another type of information processing and not necessarily the best for all types of information and situations. In the end, his agenda is other than what his words are saying, and when he heals those emotional scars his diatribe is veiling he'll realize that with or without \\"God\\" people will be at just about the same relative level of ignorance and superstition, wisdom and knowing, etc.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|In 2006, Rihanna released her sophomore album quite close to her debut album (only about 8 months after). While it may seem rushed, the album's quality shows otherwise. Rihanna mizes in some pop hits, some beautiful ballads, her carribean roots and even a rock-influenced track. The versatility of this album shows just how strong an artist Rihanna is.  <br /> <br />\\"S.O.S.\\" is Rihanna's biggest hit to date, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The song samples \\"Tainted Love\\" by Soft Cell but I think Rihanna really makes it her own. From her previous singles off her first album, you can really see that her voice and style has evolved. Plus, she looks great in the video. \\"Unfaithful\\" is Rihanna's second single from the album. In this ballad written by Ne-Yo, Rihanna takes an interesting position as the person who is cheating. I don't think many artists take this side, instead preferring to be the one being cheated on. This was her second biggest hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. You can really hear the emotion in her voice as she sings and the music supports her voice very well. The ending is one of the best parts because the music finishes off the song so well. Another interesting point to the song is that she compares herself to a murderer with her cheating and once again, this is a relatively new approach to a song. It's good to see someone not just following the trend and pulling it off well. \\"We Ride\\" is Rihanna's third single that didn't live up to the success of her two previous singles. At first, I wasn't too crazy about the song but now I think that it was a good choice. For me,this is the song that you sit in the car and lsiten to. I call it \\"the weekend song.\\" It didn't chart on the Billbaord Hot 100 but I think this is very unfair since it's one of the better songs on A Girl Like Me. \\"Break It Off,\\" a collaboration with Sean Paul, is confirmed to be the fourth single from the album. I think that it is a good song but the song has a little too much Sean Paul and not enough Rihanna. If they switched this, then I'm sure the song would sound better to me. However Rihanna holds her own on the track. I'm expecting a great video for this one. The fifth (and final) rumored single is \\"P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)\\". This one is pretty good but I'm nor sure that this should be chosen as the final single from the album. I would have much prefered \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" or \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.\\" This song is pretty mellow and I think that is a little too similar to \\"We Ride.\\" Maybe over time, the song will grow on me enough so that I can see it as single material. <br /> <br />\\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" is my personal favorite song from the album because of its sound. It's rock-influenced, which is different from the usual Rihanna we are used to. I don't like rock but it's pop-rock so it's all good. I really think this should have been a single because it shows off Rihanna's voice and she doesn't have many songs that do that. \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" is my favorite carribean styled song on the album. This track, which is a collaboration with J-Status, is a nice song that can just make you smile when you think about the one you love. \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want (Part II)\\" is another favorite. I first heard it at a carnival and immediately I knew that I had to download this song. It features Cory Gunz, who drops in some nice verses of his own. It's not much of a remix but the music of the song definitely is better than the original.  <br /> <br />\\"Selfish Girl\\" and \\"Dem Haters [featuring Dwane Husbands]\\" explore Rihanna's carribean style and these tracks are okay. They're not the fire tracks that she can deliver but they are listenable.  <br /> <br />\\"A Million Miles Away\\" and \\"Final Goodbye\\" are the only two tracks that are subpar on this album. Both are ballads and I don't think Rihanna has the best luck with ballads [excluding \\"Unfaithful\\" of course]. The music doesn't really stand out andI think her voice contrasts with the music too much. <br /> <br />Overall, A Girl Like Me is good album with its hits and misses. She generally chose the right songs for singles except for the last one, but that's okay. Rihanna is working on another album, currently titled \\"One\\" that is due out in 2007. Clearly she has been working hard [an album every year since she's started] with her first single rumored to be By Yo Side [featuring T.I.] that should be released around the same time as \\"P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You).\\" Rihanna deserves a break but if she continues to bring this hotness, then she will become a bigger name than she already is.
0141439688|5.0|Certainly one of the greatest literary minds of all time is that of Jane Austen, an author who has been much-maligned by her unfair modern association with \\"chick-lit\\" (it's nice that \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" was based on \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but that should not reflect unduly on Austen's work). The trick is that while Austen's novels do tend to center on a romantic plot they are imbued with many other facets that make them so much more than trifling entertainments. Sharp social commentary is particularly prevalent in all of her novels, perhaps none more-so than her final work, \\"Persuasion\\" -- with its deft handling of a woman's place in society and of the difficulties imposed by class barriers. Its focus is on Anne Elliot, middle child of the pretentious Sir Walter, who has no use for her in his life -- choosing to favor his eldest daughter Elizabeth (who, truly, takes after her father in all selfish respects) and to offer regard to his youngest, Mary, at least as a woman who has fulfilled her purpose by marrying satisfactorily. Years earlier Lady Russell, a family friend who became a sort of surrogate parent to Anne after her mother's death, persuaded Anne to break her engagement to her beloved Frederick Wentworth, believing him to be an inferior sort of person who would only make Anne miserable in time. Now, eight years later, Wentworth is a successful captain in the British navy who has proven that he would have been a more than worthy match for Anne in situation as well as affection. But when he comes back into her life, Anne must live with the consequences of her earlier decision as Wentworth appears to have moved on -- actively seeking a wife right under Anne's nose. Anne also finds herself being courted by her cousin William, who would be a perfectly sensible match for her, but since her heart still belongs to Captain Wentworth she cannot bear to consider it. The plot conventions will be familiar to fans of Austen, but that does not detract from the sharpness and enjoyability of the tale in the slightest. The keen observations are on target, and \\"Persuasion\\" has the added benefit of having some of the best characters in the Austen canon this side of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Anne proves to be a heroine worthy of Elizabeth Bennet's approval, and Captain Wentworth an amiable counterpoint to the steelier Mr. Darcy. Mary's histrionics are reminiscent of the wailings of Mrs. Bennet, providing blissful comic relief without becoming too overbearing. Best of all, naturally, is the omnipresent Austen wit -- an incomparable achievement in all of her novels, on fine display here in \\"Persuasion\\". Anyone who has not yet experienced Jane Austen is missing out on some enjoyable and delightfully thought-provoking reading, and should get started as soon as possible.s and enjoyability of the tale in the slightest.

006097625X|5.0|Want 3 of the best-ever books on the general topic of comics? Here they are! (each generally sold separately)<br /><br />1.*Understanding Comics- A *landmark* & bestselling examination of the medium. A comicbook on comics! It gives us a dictionary-style definition of what comics is and then proceeds to detail the meaning in its applications. Relates the medium of comics to art & art history, and then breaks down the invisible principles that make sense of it all: the relationships between words, pictures, icons, styles, genres, perception, abstraction, and the overall vocabulary of comics. One of my favorite concepts detailed here is the triangle diagram he uses to describe all visual arts. It's 3 vertices are REALITY, LANGUAGE, and THE PICTURE PLANE. He shows that any artist's work in any visual medium can be described as being part of this highly conceptual, visual triangle. This triangle chart alone is worth the price of the book(!), and makes comics as a medium more accessible to students of art in general. He then examines the intricacies of comics construction, and the way reader participation makes the comics experience unique. Various elements here include: panel transitions, time, principles in linework, word-picture balance, the general creative process, and even a brief section on color. Even eastern & western differences within comics is given several mentions, giving an interesting, international scope to this international bestseller! 5 Stars!<br /><br />2.*Reinventing Comics- Maybe his best *looking* book (in my opinion), it's basically split into 2 sections: The 12 Revolutions in comics; and then basic Internet/Computer/Web Comics. It's the least popular & practical in the Trilogy, yet I still really like it! 4-1/2 Stars.<br /><br />3.*Making Comics- It's like Understanding Comics refined, as well as a \\"hands-on\\" introduction to the medium. It competes with that 1st title for most popular in the Trilogy, and it's highly recommended to anyone who wants to make comics! I like it! 5 Stars.<br /><br />In conclusion: While I try not to use the \\"genius\\" label *too* liberally, with Understanding Comics it really seems to fit(!).it! 5 Stars.    In conclusion: While I try not to use the \\"genius\\" label *too* liberally, with Understanding Comics it really seems to fit(!).
B000GG4KTU|4.0|It was the 2004 album 'The Girl In The Room' that showcased Krall's own songwriting talents, inspired by her own collection of records and artists she admired such as Tom Waits and Joni Mitchell and highlighting the melancholic side of life and its complex ambiguities.  <br /> <br />This proved to be one of the critical successes of the year and a surprise at that.  <br /> <br />Krall returns to more familiar territory this time with a collection of standards, enlisting once again the talents of Jeff Hamilton and Jeff Clayton as part of her regular trio (and adding their big band) and the contemplative guitar licks of Anthony Wilson, son of orchestral maestro Gerald. <br /> <br />The melancholy of the previous album has dissipated to be replaced by a joyous celebration of life.  <br /> <br />This is reflected in tunes such as 'Isn't This A Lovely Day' and 'Come Dance With Me', while 'Exactly Like You' is given a mid-tempo latin feel.  <br /> <br />On the reflective side Jobim's 'How Sensitive' receives a Claus Ogerman-style arrangement. In general the trio playing is near flawless and the Basie-esque big band swings to good effect.  <br /> <br />A recording guaranteed to appeal to audiophiles of jazz sensibility. While awaiting more challenging and eclectic musical explorations from Diana Krall in the future, for the present this will do just fine. <br />

It can be frustrating for people who don't think in ways that allow contingency plans or fail to adapt to how others play their pieces. I'm not sure I would call it \\"educational\\" but it's definitely the kind of game where you have to think.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  The cast does a wonderful job, but it's the leading ladies who \\"steal the CD\\".  Both Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are equally great as Galinda/Glinda and Elphaba/Wicked Witch respectively.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Watch this show! Veronica Mars is, by far, the best show on television right now. <br /> <br />If a television series has a tremendously loyal and devoted fan base, then you know it has to be something very special. Fans for Veronica Mars have gone through extreme lengths to promote it. I don't understand why more people don't watch this show unless they are too dimwitted to appreciate an intelligent drama that has intricate plot lines, witty writing, fully developed characters, and a strong, yet charming, female protagonist.  <br /> <br />I like to think that most people just haven't heard of it or given it a chance. Do yourself a favor and check it out. Get this DVD and you will be hooked. <br /> <br />Don't let this show be cancelled!
B00006BTCA|4.0|Funny how no one related bits and pieces of this album to The Sisters Of Mercy and The Mission. Stella (bla bla) really reminds me of First And Last And Always (SoM) or The First Chapter (or even God's Own Medicine both from The Mission). Much more to these than to Joy Division. And yes, some bits remind me of Echo & The Bunnymen or the Psichedelic Furs.  The album goes from dark NYC rock to UK glam alternative rock - and makes a pit stop in the 80's trendy pop that emerged right after the punk era (or post punk if you prefer). The opening (Untitled) and closing (Leif Erikson) tracks have bits of genius in them, no doubt about this. Personally, I feel that the opening track is very grandious, nearly titanic or epic, whilst the last is one that fills us with anxiety from something or a deep hole in the heart from longing (ie some kind of suffering). Both are different from each other but they sure belong to the same album and, paradoxaly, do complement each other. The album is very solid and though it may not be a futur \\"must have\\" it will probably qualify for a \\"should have\\". Lyrics are not a given nor are they easy or simple to follow and grasp. Very refreshing but also a lot of quality. As for the band, it all depends on the future and how Interpol will be regarded in 5 - 10 years. Personnaly, I feel that ANTICS is paving an excelent road for a milestone band title. I also feel that I am now sufficiently far away (in time) as to ponder correctly what I intend to say about this album. To me, a must have and milestone album because of a promising unburial of rock (and all of the subgenres that were created since). A milestone of what? Dunno, but a revival of the 80-90's with this quality and breed is always welcome. Even when updated to our 00's decade. A lot of pedigree and very good quality music wrap up the band in a glamorous and promising package. You will not be disappointed. Let's come back here in 10 years and talk about these guys, the fact that we will dothat will only prove me right.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Occasionally, just occasionally, a film becomes a culture in its own right, and everything it is related to falls away around it to leave it standing on its own. Spirited Away is such a film. It has taken over box office records in Japan, and not done too badly in the western hemisphere, widely being cited as one of, or even the, best animated film ever produced.  <br /> <br />But Miyazaki's epic is not just a brilliant animated film. It is a brilliant film. All too often, animated features are great because of the animation, that is the technical dazzle and sheer fantasy nature that the animated medium allows for. And that's great. Spirited Away, however, goes further. The themes it touches on - greed, emotional attachment and the imperfection complex that blights every human being; as well as presenting the importance of traditional values - can be found nestled in the scripts of the deepest live action films. <br />We quickly become immunised to the sheer weirdness of the world presented to us in this film, and that helps us identify with the characters that we might otherwise struggle with.  <br /> <br />The plot is summarised well above, but to give a brief outline (which falls massively short of doing the film's complexity justice); I don't want to ruin the sheer surprise of the exotic, and downright bizarre nature of the spirit world; suffice to say it'll leave you dumbstruck and inspired by the attention to detail that has gone into it. Essentially, the film follows Chihiro, a ten year old girl, who, along with her parents, is transported magically into a world of spirits and sorcery. When her parents are turned into pigs by a cruel spell, she must battle her way through the politics and intrigue of the society she has been stranded in. Helping and hindering her along the way are the friendly but icy spirit Haku, and the greedy sorceress Yubaba. Chihiro must find her way out of the spirit world alive, and with her parents restored to human form. Confused? You will be, so the trick is to let go for two hours and allow yourself to become immersed in the fantasy of this spirit world. <br /> <br />You come away from this film feeling like you've learnt something, feeling like you've had a good time, and absolutely certain that you're going to watch it again. This is the hallmark of a good film - shelf life - and in this respect Spirited Away is timeless. Like all truly brilliant motion pictures (e.g. Where Eagles Dare, The Sting, Crouching Tiger: Hidden Dragon), you come away with a substantial number of questions, and a need to have a repeat viewing to start to answer some of them.  <br /> <br />Purists will prefer the original Japanese version, but the dubbed English version has made the film accessible to many more; and, as it's an animated film, the dubbing is considerably less obvious than with live action films. As an animator, I have found a repetitive draw to this film for inspiration and ideas; but as a regular movie-goer, I simply find it a truly excellent, must-see flick.

0143036556|1.0|I found Jarred Diamond's, \\"Collapse\\" disappointing after his impressive, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"  I will limit my comments here to Diamond's brief analysis of the collapse of the Maya kingdoms during the Terminal Classic period, which I found overly simplistic, considering the complexity of the issues surrounding this event presented in the wealth of information coming out of field studies throughout the Maya lowlands.   <br /> <br />In this chapter of \\"Collapse,\\" Diamond presents an uninformed picture of the nature of the interaction between the Maya and the tropical forest in which they lived and prospered for several thousand years before the collapse.  He spends several pages discussing Maya agricultural practices in terms of their limited productivity and comparing these to more successful Aztec and Andean methods, and disparages the Maya diet as having \\"limited protein\\" content.  Diamond clearly expresses a limited understanding of ancient American agriculture and diet in statements like these, which are simply not true.  In numerous books and articles, Mayanists marvel over the brilliance of Maya horticultural and agricultural innovations that turned their tropical forests into productive gardens, which reach far beyond the cultivation of corn.  Tree crops alone were amazingly productive for the Maya.   <br /> <br />Diamond stumbles through explanations of Maya warfare when he points out that the Maya had low-productivity corn that hindered their ability to feed warriors on the march, and no large animals to carry supplies for long military campains.  Here he misses the point that American cultures may have made war differently than Old World cultures and perhaps got along fine for thousands of years without beasts of burdon.  But he uses such reasoning to explain why Maya kingdoms were small in size and no great Maya empire ever expanded across the lowlands, as if that consequential to our understanding of the Maya. <br /> <br />Finally, the point of the chapter, that the ancient Maya did themselves in by exceeding the carrying capacity of their land in ways that conveniently echo our own destructive environmental practices -- overpopulation, destruction of their forest resource base, and then suffered periods of intense drought, which pushed their complex society over the ecological edge, leading to political collapse and abandonment of much of the lowlands.  It is a neat senario, and has some circumstancial support by climatic data...but still very debatable among researchers, who include scientists from many disciplines.  There are many other circumstances that were going on that better explain this collapse, environmental challenges may weigh among them in places. <br /> <br />I think Diamond is not in a position to make a contribution to the Maya collapse debate, as expressed in this weak chapter.  Unfortunately, for an emminant geographer, Diamond displays an amazing lack of familiarity with the Maya and the other ancient American cultures he examines in this chapter.  I think that the jury is still out concerning the cause of the Classic Maya collapse.  Unfortunately, explanations like this one do a disservice to the Maya, who perhaps should be marveled at for their ecological successes rather than held up as an example of another civilization that ruined their land, like us.
B000002OZY|3.0|This album has 3 maybe 4 decent tracks on it the rest is lets be honest mediocre. Probably because its generally regarded as the first rock opera critics make a big deal about it. I found it fairly uninspiring. Dont bother following the story. I suggest downloading the good tracks and saving your money.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Since I notice all the questions seem to concern the logistics of the set, that is the main thing I will address in this review, since you would have to be a resident of another planet to not know the story behind the series \\"Friends\\". Suffice it to say it is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the \\"post-college adolescent phase\\" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you \\"settle down\\" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.<br /><br />As for logistics, this collection fits in a sturdy red box that's less than a foot long. There are 40 DVDs containing 236 episodes that can be found inside. The Friends set just has two pieces of the box that comes together. Flipping the top up exposes the guts of the set consisting of 6 books, with one for each Friend. Thus there are only 6 books to hold the 10 seasons. Each book has a picture of the Friend, a number (1-6), and the episodes you can find in each case. The books flip open from the top, and each disc has its own pouch in the double-sided pages. Every disc has a different photo of the Friend, and they're all inserted into the pouches so that the photo is visible as you flip through the book. The disc number and episode numbers are also visible. The contents of the discs are the same as the previous sets, but they have new artwork.<br /><br />Besides the packaging, there's just one thing to note for this release, that being the episode guide booklet. This 60 page booklet lists every episode with its synopsis and the disc you can find it on. Of course, the bonus material is mentioned along with the disc it can be found on, and the bonus features include 25 documentaries. You'll also get the original treatment for the series written by David Crane and Marta Kauffman. The booklet, which is as wide as the box, can be found behind the DVD books.<br /><br />As for screen format, it's full screen, which is what Friends was filmed in. The full screen ratio is 4:3, which is the same as 1.33:1. You can record in wide screen and chop off parts of the frame to make it fit a traditional 4:3 TV, which is what is done with full screen editions of movies. However, you can't add stuff to a frame that was recorded in 4:3 and make it widescreen.<br /><br />There's very little of value here for someone who already has the season 1-10 boxes, and the book with the episode information is just an upgraded version of the booklets that come with the season sets. If you don't already own the 10 seasons then this is an easy way to buy the show since it is a lot cheaper than buying each set individually. It's also nicer than the box set released last year, which was the existing 10 seasons in a big box. If you decide to replace your existing sets then you'll be happy to know the set takes up exactly the same amount of shelf space.course, the bonus material is mentioned along with the disc it can be found on, and the bonus features include 25 documentaries.

B00005JPCD|5.0|At first upon seeing the teasers, I felt the movie would be another kiddie-no-brainer.  I ended going to see it anyway, and found myself laughing  during 90% of the movie!!<br /><br />Indeed it takes a stab at bigotry, religion, peer-pressure, etc.; but I think that is a good thing.  Movies do not have to be politically correct, and I'm glad many are made without looking for the approval of governments, church, etc.  It's message is very clear: \\"Our actions as humans impact the rest of nature, and in our blinded greed, we need amazing things to make us stop and watch, and possibly, change our ways\\".<br /><br />Even if you don't share the movie's viewpoints, the animation, music and sequences provide for ample entertainment; unless, ofcourse, you can't bear it if somebody else has a viewpoint different than yours!<br /><br />Yes, the movie promotes tolerance for those who are different; for those who stray from the 'norm'; but, in the end, that is what makes humanity evolve and adapt.  If we don't, we'll soon join the dinosaurs ... in heaven, maybe?  Sorry, I forgot, dinosaurs didn't go to heaven...
B000EULJLU|5.0|This cd is awesome if you are a TOOL fan.  If your a nut rag you probably won't like it.  All in All EVERY track on this CD is incredible.  I own every TOOL cd and enjoy Alex Grey a lot.  When they decided to work together on Lateralus it was nice, when they worked together on this project it turned out very very well.  So if you did'nt like this album thats your fault for hearing it and not listening to it.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|The cinematography was great in this movie. I mean from the type of film they used on down to the angles that the scenes were shot were great. But what happened to the rest of the movie? Movies like miami vice are supposed to have a good plot, good acting, a decent amount of action and maybe a love scene hear and there. Miami vice failed in all categories. The movie is slow. It takes a really long time for any action to even occur. By time some action happened I was on my way to sleep. If you want to see a movie with great scene shots but is boring as hell this is the movie for you. Thank god for blockbuster on line because if I had paid for this movie I would be very upset. Bad Boys 1 and 2 are much better cop/Miami movies than this one is.
B000059T1G|4.0|Despite some of the negative press it gets for being thrown together by the record company, this is actually pretty good. The opening song hasn't aged well but everything else is pretty great.Shanghai Noodle Factory, Withering Tree and Medicated Goo shows Traffic as about as good as they get. Now about the live performances, these get ragged on quite a bit, however the new remastered version they've never sounded cleaner. The quality stems for how they were recorded-basic 2 track with no being able to fix it in the mix. The performances are all top notch and of songs that are not currently available elsewhere. Sure I wish Chris Wood was louder in the mix and Stevie Winwood's organ wasn't turned up quite so loud. Feelin' Good is wonderful and full of emotion. Blind Man shows how great they were at taking a blues tune and turning it into something special. You'd never guess that they didn't write these two tunes.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I have given this album a half-a-dozen listens in the hope that I could find something of value here.  Nope! <br /> <br />The rating system is 1 - 5 stars or I would have given this a well deserved negative rating as it is just not good enough for a zero. <br /> <br />Innovative?  Give me a break!  Yoko Ono, Radiohead, Bjork, King Crimson and many others are innovative.  These guys just sound incoherent, lacking in talent and overly stoned. <br /> <br />I will say this though, if I ever have a serious case of insomnia I will take this CD out from under the half-full glass on my coffee table and give it a spin.  I should be asleep in no time.
B000J103YI|5.0|Wow this is one amazing soundtrack. Truly it is. I would put it at the top of my list of soundtracks. I am so amazed at the amount of talent and time and effort put into making this one great product for everyone to enjoy. Beyonce, Jennifer, Eddie, Jaime, Anika, and Keith all shine on this stellar CD.  <br /> <br />My personal favorite is Jennifer Hudsons version of \\"One Night Only\\". It is such an intense, riveting and emotional song. It gives me goosebumps. <br /> <br />Jaime also delivers on \\"When I First Saw You\\".  <br /> <br />You will not be disappointed by \\"Family\\" either. That is an incredible song. <br /> <br />Beyonce also does her things, but as many have agreed to it is Jennifer who walks away with this one. Which isnt such a bad thing, considering Beyonce has done alot and proved herself worthy of the star she is. There is plenty of room at the top for all to enjoy success! <br /> <br />A + Effort!
B000JJRIN4|4.0|While L.A.M.B suffered from massive disarray in terms of music direction, The Sweet Escape finds Gwen Stefani rather focused, the disc is split between the more hip-hop urban stuff and the more No Doubt-ish pop-rock tunes.<br /><br />First single Wind It Up which samples Rodgers' and Hammerstein's The Lonely Goatherd from The Sound of Music finds her and Pharrell Williams at work again. More along the lines of Hollaback Girl, it might have sounded like a mish mash of one too many samples but a few listens later, you'll find yourself humming along. The rest of the more upbeat urban tracks find  Stefani working with Akon on the title track (which is really a funky song where Akon actually doesn't rap but sings) and Pharrell guesting on Yummy.<br /><br />The best tracks here are the ones that you might probably find on a No Doubt album. The fabulous yet heartaching Early Winter has Tim Rice-Oxley of Keane co-writing. Stefani oozes sensuality on 4 In The Morning co-written with Tony Kanal, again talking about the lonesome wait for a strayed lover. The new wave synth track, Wonderful Life (co-penned with Linda Perry) about an ex-high school boyfriend who recently passed away closes the album perfectly with Martin Gore of Depeche Mode on guitars.<br /><br />This time round, The Sweet Escape succeeds where L.A.M.B did not. (B+)
B000E1YVZU|5.0|RENT is Spectacular!!!!!!!!!!!....it grows on you!!   The more you watch,  & the more you listen, the more you understand about the story and the music is marvelous!!   The first time I saw it I was totally confused about the story but LOVED the music...now I have seen it numerous times...and LOVE the story and LOVE the music even more! <br />
B00005JPCD|5.0|I'm 38 year old man, and all I have to say is that this movie spoke to me. Warner brothers is likely to get my money at least a couple more times before it leaves the theater and then again when it comes to DVD. I'm not going to expose plot points or anything like that you can read other reviews for that stuff. I'm more putting this here for the folks that are reading their own ideas into what they saw when they saw this movie. if your looking for certain things and then interpret those things a certain way, you're going to find them, good and bad. there's nothing wrong with and environmental message. we as humans are the top of the food chain, so to speak, but we sure don't act that way most of time. it is our responsibility to conserve, save and share this planet, be it with penguins or otherwise. we share this earth with a million other beautiful creatures. it's not just ours, it's theirs too, they live here too, they're not alien beings taking up our space, they were put here same as you and me, earthlings. as far as folks reading in religious, racial, sexual etc., stereotypes and otherwise, go ahead and check any of the latest pixar(no knock to pixar, just an example) and you'll find the same. as far it not all being for kids, go ahead and check out some old tom and jerry, there's about 20 times more violence in one 3 minute cartoon than in Happy Feet. Yes there are some scary moments but that's where the movie gives you a dose of reality as any one of you who have seen march of the penguins knows. If you think they're (WB) going to let a silly thing getting eaten get in the way of our hero saving the day, then you might as well walk out. Sure there are few sad moments too, but any of you seen Bambi and Finding Nemo? Hey man I'm a big cry baby myself.  the biggest message I found in Happy Feet was that there's nothing wrong with being different and pursuing your own thing, that one thing just might end up saving the world one day, maybe not the whole world, butmaybe your world. That's another cool thing about this movie, in spite of all the hard times Mumble is handed for being different, he doesn't back down for a second, misfit or not, he stays true to what he feels inside, if that's not being cool, then I don't know what is. So for all of you knocking this great movie with a great message, let's just calm down a bit and take it for what it is, some great family entertainment. if you take your kids and choose to explain certain items about the movie a certain way, that's on you, not Warner brothers. remember, if you look for bad, you're going to find bad. I find most movies to be up for ones own interpretation anyway and not all are going to walk away with the same experience. if you must go ahead and ask the folks at WB if they were actually tryting to get a certain point across that you found objectionable about Happy Feet. The music is great, the dancing is great, and the baby penguins couldn't more adorable. HAPPY FEET ROCKS!
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|I haven't taken this out of the stereo since I got it 3 days ago!  If you are a U2 fan, you have to have this in your collection.  The videos are a hoot showing us how U2 and us, their fans, have aged through the years. Love the mullets! <br /> <br />BUY IT!
0375505091|5.0|1990 - 2005 is the period of time brilliant photographer Annie Leibovitz elects to share with us.  Not only is this hefty and beautifully designed volume of her work of artistic significance, it is also one of the more understated yet tender musings on the life cycle as it affects one person.<br /><br />One of the most sought after portrait photographers in the world, this volume does not disappoint those whose major interest is seeing the big celebrities in the inimitable manner in which Leibovitz captures them: her portraits arrest time and allow us to linger in that sacred moment of connection between artist and model like few others can achieve.  Here are photographs of Sylvester Stallone with his aging upper torso alone showing - a study in the inevitable pull of gravity that age diminishes youth; images of stars like Nicole Kidman and Jack Nicholson, of political figures like Bush cum cabinet and Arnold Schwarzenegger, writers like Joan Didion, William Burroughs - the list is long.<br /><br />But what grounds this collection is Leibovitz' self portraits in the tub, images of her family both immediate and extended, and one of the more sensitive tributes to the much missed Susan Sontag who lived with Leibovitz through her chemotherapy and demise.  Not since Don Bachardy drew the last days of his dying Christopher Isherwood has there been a more respectful yet wholly immediate audience with death.<br /><br />Leibovitz' writing adds to the portfolio, a bonus here as she is usually not a woman of words.  But taken as a whole this is a volume of the work and mind and heart of Annie Leibovitz that is well worth its high cost: these images will stay with the viewer indelibly.  Grady Harp, December 06
0307346609|2.0|The first few segments of this book are riveting. Oblique hints at horrors yet to come, ominous cues, and the pure cool factor of zombies all work together to make you think you've really found something good. But you'll be cured of that idea when you're about a fourth of the way though the book.<br /><br />This book lacks several critical components. The most important is a collection of interesting characters. Most of the characters in this book appear only once, a few show up twice. There is no time for the reader to connect to the characters and begin care about what happens to them. At first I thought the different interview subjects would come back and we would learn more about what happens to them, but usually once a interview is over, we never see that person again.<br /><br />The actual plot itself is quite linear, with no plot twists or unexpected events. Pretty much zombies show up, the world falls apart, and then humans claw their way back from the brink.<br /><br />There is some haunting imagery from time to time, but mostly the 1st person narratives focus on action more than illustration, giving the book a sort of detached feeling at times. We are told people do things, but it is difficult to actually picture what is happening because of the lack of details. Even when things are at their worst (which comes surprisingly early in the book), I never really got the feeling of total impending doom. The horror of the situation rarely hits home as the lack of description lets the grimmest days of the crisis pass without much more emphasis than the early days of the Great Panic. This problem really highlights itself with a lovingly described river of zombies shambling their way through a bombed out city under a black sky. This image is the one that sticks out in my mind as the most effective and chilling passage of the book- and it's of a painting done by a crewmember on a nuclear submarine. Not any action, not anything that actually happens during the story;a painting.<br /><br />Some people have negatively commented on some of the political content in the books, but I don't really mind it. What I do find annoying is the author's stubborn refusal to actually name what he is obviously referring to. The term \\"brushfire\\" war is used so many times I wanted to puke. It's like the author is trying to impress us with how clever he is at referencing something without actually spelling it out. I think this is because he wanted to seem hip and unconcerned about what people thought of his work, except that he didn't want to offend any potential readers. Instead of actually naming any names, he substitutes generic social commentary. The author tries to be fashionably cynical about human nature, but instead of taking the time to come up with thoughtful social commentary (such as George Romero's zombies in a shopping mall mirroring the brain dead consumerism of American culture), he just depicts a lot of people as being petty, stupid, selfish jerks.<br /><br />As a short story, this book might have worked. But extended to the length of a novel, it just falls apart under its own weight.
B000GFLE86|5.0|I really loved this album mainly because of the very smooth and clear vocal style that Madeleine creates. Many backgrounds have a very relaxing melodic beat that pretty much leads you to become addicted. I am honestly hooked and I can't stop listening to songs like, \\"Half the perfect world\\", \\"La Javainese\\", \\"California Raining\\". Her songs also have a story that immerses you into the essence of her life. I also loved her last album \\"Careless love\\", this current album seems like a continuation of her \\"story line\\" that she started in the previous. Listen to her entire album on her website and you can decide for yourself. :)
B000JJRIN4|5.0|This release is living up to my expectations;  unfortunately for many of the other reviewers that is not the case.  THE SWEET ESCAPE is better than any other \\"pop/r&b\\" CD this year - or since her last solo release.  Stefani is so likeable that her poseur stance works so well - I am sure Madonna would kill to do something as original as this.  There are great grooves (4 AM) amazing hooks (Wind it Up / Yummy) and great beats (Fluorescent).  The production is unequaled = however you have to be a fan of the perfect pure pop production.  A pal of mine who prefers Neil Young & Steve Forbert thought this sounded like a cocaine fueled extravaganza - which I imagine in some ways it does - but everything is so fast today this fits in.  No other record comes close to the music and vocals on this - Gwen - a true artist.  (Title track sucks though, honey).
0670034711|5.0|First, let me get out of the way the fact that I thought this was an excellent book.  I wouldn't have thought that to read about a woman spending 4 months in Italy, India and Indonesia would have made for such good reading, but I was wrong.  It shows that, if a writer is talented enough (and Ms. Gilbert surely is), anything can be made interesting.  She comes off as funny, extroverted, thoughtful, charming and--especially--brutally honest about herself.  In fact, she is so open with her readers that at times, I felt like I was reading her private diary or something that anyone else would write only to their closest confidante. <br /> <br />While I was reading the book however, I kept thinking about something else entirely:  I wonder what it would be like to go out with this woman?  (Given that this book seems to have a 99% female readership judging from the reviews, and I am not, I suspect that few others were wondering the same thing.)  Anyway, here is what I thought about.  On the plus side, she's a wonderful writer which tells me that she must be very intelligent and that's obviously a good thing.  Her looks?  Quite attractive ... I think.   I say that because the only photos I've seen are the one on the dust jacket (which  is very flattering) and one on her website, which is pleasant enough but in which she looks like a completely different woman. <br /> <br />On the minus side however, she seems to have an incongruous combination of personality traits.  For example, when it comes to men, she seems simultaneously incredibly independent and yet incredibly needy.  I suspect that this combination may have played a role in the troubles she had with her husband and with \\"David\\".  To me, one of the most revealing paragraphs in the book is on page 65 where she talks about her \\"boundary issues with men\\".  She tells us that when she's in love with a man, she gives herself over to him completely until she becomes so exhausted that it's time to become infatuated with someone else.  Virtually by her own admission, she seems to be what Vince Vaughn called a \\"stage 5 clinger\\" in \\"Wedding Crashers\\".  How many men would line up to be with someone like that?   <br /> <br />She also seems like someone full of melodrama who careens back and forth between very high high's and very low low's with not much in between.  She seems to hope (and expect) that her feelings towards her mate (and vice versa) will always be as intense as they were at the highest point, and  I imagine her to be disappointed if a relationship should ever descend from that plateau.  If in fact that's her mindset, that's a recipe for trouble.  (To her credit though, she seemed to have more of an equilibrium about her by the end of the book than she did at the beginning, which is perhaps not surprising.)  It was difficult to tell however whether her wanderlust and her peripatetic nature had changed by the end.  I suspect that it hadn't, which might not augur well for her future relationships unless she can find a soulmate who does nothing but travel around the world with her.   (Come to think of it, maybe she did find such a person in \\"Felipe\\".)   In any event, regardless of whether she is a total catch or a total nightmare (or something in between), the fact remains that she is a hell of a writer and I highly recommend her book.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|The footage released in this 2 DVD package only shows the world what the real KISS was all about. The most striking thing about it all is how great Peter Criss was in his prime. At times, you almost feel you're watching an entirely different Peter, one you've never seen before. From the Long Beach footage till the end, he shines as we really know Paul, Ace and Gene pretty much and have seen their antics many times. Its really sad that Paul and Gene decided NOT to include BETH from the Paul Lynde Show, apart from the fact that Paul mentions it in the linear notes of the DVD. They were jealous of the success of BETH, no doubt, and this proves it. I'm sure Peter will gain new respect from KISS fans who watch this DVD. Long Live PETER CRISS.
0312935080|4.0|Mr. Connelly's book reminded me of an extended TV courtroom drama, with plenty of action in court and on the streets. Harry Bosch appears again, imperfections and all, this time as both the defendent and the focus of the outside drama to uncover the truth and find the \\"Follower\\".  <br /> <br />The story picks up pace in the second half, after some breakthrough thinking by Harry. Connelly includes enough twists that some of my guesses were right, whereas others (including the \\"Follower\\") were wrong, which is how I like it.  Honey Chandler was well done, wheras Connelly couldn't resist plenty of digs at the in-house lawyer on Harry's team, including making the guy fat and sweaty and employed only because he presumably couldn't get a better job.  <br /> <br />Perhaps Connelly should have Harry do less of the heavy lifting himself. Seemingly every interesting conclusion was reached by Harry personally. <br /> <br />This was only my second book of Connelly's, so some of the backstory was unknown. The novel stands well enough on its own, with perhaps the exception of girlfriend Sylvia. Her character was relatively undeveloped and uninteresting, mostly as a hook for some rest in the main plot line and to show some of Harry's personal turmoil and breadth. <br /> <br />Given that the theme involves the porn industry, prostitution, and sex crimes, the story may not be for everyone. Connelly stays on this side of being too crude, and one must expect his LA setting to include this genre in one or more of his books, just as CSI in Vegas can't exactly avoid gambling topics.  <br /> <br />Harry's pager was one example of how the world has changed significantly even since \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" was published in 1994. How many people still \\"beep\\" each other? To the contrary, murder and porn remain timeless.
B000089CJI|5.0|I don't really know where I first heard about the collaborative effort that is now The Postal Service, but I somehow obtained a copy of Give Up that someone left in my car. Though Death Cab For Cutie has really taken off in the past two years, and this superstar laden duo really hasn't gotten much attention.     The sound of the band is new and different than much of the music on the radio today. The lyrics are extremely well written, the choruses are catchy, and the musical aptitude is evident. As impressed I was at the first listen, the magic of this album lies in its ability to impress: track after track, listen after listen.     The individual tracks help to make this album by staying, well, individual. On many solid albums the songs blend together to keep the album alive. In the process however, those albums tracks blend together, thus stripping the individual tracks of their identity. This phenomenon does not plague Give Up. Each track is original, each with its own unique flavor that drives the whole album. \\"The District Sleeps Tonight\\", \\"Such Great Heights\\", and \\"Brand New Colony\\" are the best songs on the album. Considering that every track would be a standout track on any other album, this album really is a super-album. This album is a sum of its parts, and when each part is excellent, it creates a stellar CD.
0525476881|4.0|An Abundance of Katherines is about a boy named Colin who has just graduated from high school, and is experiencing a bit of a mid-life crisis. You see, in his youth, Colin was a prodigy. And now, at 18, he feels washed up, having not lived up to his potential, not become a full-fledged genius. To top that off, he's just been dumped by his 19th Katherine. Colin only dates girls named Katherine, and has had 19 relationships of varying length and depth with Katherines since early elementary school. This most recent one lasted nearly a year, before K-19 broke Colin's heart.<br /><br />To take Colin's mind off of his problems, his best friend Hassan proposes that the two friends go on a road trip. They make it as far as Gutshot, Tennessee, where, in part due to Colin's celebrity as a prodigy, they are offered a summer job doing video interviews. They become particular friends with Lindsey Lee Wells, daughter of eccentric local factory owner Hollis, and move into the gigantic bright pink Wells home. The rest of the novel recounts Colin's history with the many Katherines, in flashbacks, interspersed with Colin and Hassan's adventures in Gutshot.<br /><br />This isn't a very plot-driven novel. I found it to be not such a good bedtime reading book, because I would fall asleep. However, I loved the writing. John Green has a gift for the quirky yet memorable turn of phrase. Even using restraint, I ended up with seven passages flagged for possible quotation. For example:<br /><br />\\"Colin's mother shook her head rhythmically, like a disapproving metronome.\\" (page 12);<br /><br />\\"And so the periodically incontinent prodigy ended up in a small windowless office on the South Side\\" (page18); and<br /><br />\\"Maybe if a guy is actually, literally, on fire, he won't be thinking about hooking up. But that's about it. Whereas girls are very fickle about the business of kissing. Sometimes they want to make out; sometimes they don't. They're an impenetrable fortress of unknowability, really.\\" (page 76)<br /><br />I especially loved Colin's friend Hassan. He's a chubby Arabic guy, with a sense of humor, and he's quick to point out when Colin is going off on a tangent that's \\"not interesting.\\" I really think that everyone should have a friend to tell them that. I actually think that Colin is borderline on the Asperger's Syndrome scale. He needs to be taught what other people find interesting. Here is the quotation:<br /><br />\\"\\"Not interesting,\\" Hassan said. Hassan's not-interestings had helped Colin figure out what other people did and did not enjoy hearing about. Colin had never gotten that before Hassan, because everyone else either humored or ignored him. Or, in the case of Katherines, humored then ignored. Thanks to Colin's collected list of things that weren't interesting, he could hold a halfway normal conversation.\\" (page 26). There is a footnote containing a partial list of not-interesting things, like mitosis, baroque architecture, and \\"the significant role that salt has played in human history.\\"<br /><br />And, for another window into Hassan's sense of humor, this is his explanation for why Hollis offered he and Colin jobs:<br /><br />\\"\\"She wants to make me happy. We fatties have a bond, dude. It's like a Secret Society. We've got all kinds of s*** you don't know about. Handshakes, special fat people dances--we got these secret fugging lairs in the center of the earth and we go down there in the middle of the night when all the skinny kids are sleeping and eat cake and friend chicken and s***. Why d'you think Hollis is still sleeping, kafir? Because we were up all night in the secret lair injecting butter frosting into our veins. She's given us jobs because a fatty always trusts another fatty.\\"\\" (page 72)<br /><br />I like reading a novel that's not afraid a) to have a character who is smart, and b) to include math. I love that the title on the cover is formatted as a formula. It's also interesting to see Colin, Hassan, and Lindsey evolveover the course of their summer together.

B00005JPDJ|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have seen for years. The chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law was unbelievable. It was amazing watching them together. It was a long movie, but I did not get bored at all. I usually do not like long movies. I loved the story line and the acting was amazing. I have to say I do not favor Jack Black, but he did a great job in this movie, and Kate Winslet looked absolutely amazing. The perfect romantic comedy for the holiday season or just anytime.  This definitely will be one of my favorite movies for years to come.
0736063684|5.0|This book absolutely rocks.  I consider myself to be extremely familiar with strength training and exercise in general, however, I always wanted a simple and concise book that would allow me to \\"see\\" exactly what muscles are supposed to be worked for each exercise.  Visually associating the various muscles with each exercise seems to help me focus on those particular muscles during training.  The drawings are fantastic.
B00005ATFN|4.0|The Coen Brothers have turned out yet another stylish film with a title that is a clunker. ... The Hudsucker Proxy, anyone? Still, as is The Hudsucker Proxy, this film is whimsically amusing and highly stylized, though it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea. Fans of the Coen Brothers, however, will think that they have died and gone to heaven, when they see this film.<br /><br />The film takes place in Mississippi, the heart of the deep south, during the depression. Ulysses Everett McGill, charmingly played by George Clooney, who displays some real comedic talent, is a dapper dan of a fellow. Working on a chain gang, he escapes along with two other felons, disarmingly played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They are on their way to hunt up some buried treasure, the proceeds of a robbery, which McGill claims to know about. It later turns out that this was a mere ruse on the part of McGill, as he really had a different agenda.<br /><br />During their episodic odyssey, they encounter a motley crew of characters who brighten the cinematic landscape. The film also resonates with the sounds of blue grass and down home country music. The cinematography is wonderful, as it conveys the dustbowl feeling of the depression era, rural countryside. All in all, it makes for a pretty terrific, though highly unusual, film. Funny and, at times, enigmatic, it is a film only the Coen Brothers could or would make.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Celtic Woman. Need I say more? I just caught the new concert, and WOW. What more can I say. I loved their first CD and their new music is just as good, if not better. What wonderfully talented young women. Their voices are amazing, single or together, their voices shine. Mairead can play the violin with such grace and ease. If you are a fan of Celtic Woman but have not heard their new music, pre-order the CD and DVD now. It is worth the wait to get.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Wow....what is this album.....the crappy leftovers from Love,Angel,Music,Baby?!  I expected more from an artist with such amazing vision.  L.A.M.B was so different, so new...this is just all bad.  Still a huge fan of Gwen but I cannot waste my hard earned money on this album.  Its just horrible.  Better luck on the next one Gwen.  May be its time for a No Doubt reunion?
B0000AQS6R|1.0|I have seen this movie a number of times on TV and thought it was funny.  However, the DVD has to much swearing.  I do not think they left any swear words out.  My family and I will not watch the DVD again.
B00005O5CM|5.0|A very smart young woman from California decides at the last minute she wants to go to Harvard Law School to get her very shallow man back.  In the end she gets serious and proves to herself that she is too good for him anyway.  It's a good story made great by all the humor along the way.  I really loved her Harvard admissions video, the little dog bruiser, and maybe best of all was the loud wimpering scene in the restaurant.  I've watched the movie several times, and still find myself laughing my way through it.  Highly recommended.
1582701709|5.0|As with the other reviews here, I highly recommend watching the DVD \\"The Secret\\". I have found the book useful as a transcript of the movie. I've watched the movie several times and have paused/replayed some of the scenes in an attempt to write down a specific thought or quote so I could remember it. Since the book contains all of the commentary from the movie, plus a little extra and as well as some added commentary from the author, it is very useful as a transcript reference and a reminder of the ideas expressed in the movie. It's also attractively made with \\"slick\\" pages and a smaller size which fits nicely on my nightstand.
B000AGTPUU|1.0|The animators did a surprisingly good job of capturing the painterly quality of the book, but the padded story line buried the book's spare charm with stupid subplots and contrived adventure. A real shame. <br /> <br />Someone should edit the film down to a 20-minute piece that is true to the book; it would then become a Christmas classic.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I'm not one to purchase \\"holiday\\" cd's, but I was influenced after reading the reviews here. I am so glad that I purchased this CD. The music is not your every-day christmas traditional music. Sarah sings them so magically and melodically, and the mood of the CD is perfect for any holiday setting. I plan on playing this CD as the background music for a holiday party I'm hosting. The song selections are wonderful, and there's something about Sarah McLachlan's voice and the way she sings each song that just sets the ideal mood for sitting in front of a fireplace while listening to this CD, or for any time you want to be in the mood for the season. I say this is must-have for your collection. You won't be disappointed!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm old, tired and jaded but this album made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and my eyes go all moist. At worst it's magnificent and at  its best it's jawdroppingly beautiful. It's like reliving the best moments of your childhood, falling in love, and reuniting with your best friends all at once. I want to buy crates of this album and hand out copies to strangers on the street, just to share the joy.
B0000017CA|5.0|This isn't an album you can categorize in a certain genre.Acid Bath transcend many genres of music (Psychadelic rock, Nola Death Metal and thrash)to bring you a cd that will influence rock and metal artists for generations to come. I was 16 years old when i first heard this cd. I am now 23 years of age and it rocks even harder than it did back then. Any of you metalcore kids want to hear where Killswitch got their breakdowns or Atreyu got their gothness from then listen to this cd.The coolest tracks are Jezebel, Scream of the Butterfly, Toubabo Koomi and God Machine. The only difference between this band and metal bands nowadays is this guy can actually carry a note which is a continuing problem with metal lately. Lamb of God is cool and all but Randy Blythe should really look into taking some singing lessons soon because he sucks.Anyways get this cd because it rocks.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Persona and The Seventh Seal are commonly called the masterpieces of Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. I've seen The Seventh Seal, with images that have been parodied and plagiarized endlessly; A movie with a pretty straightforward narrative sans a few scenes here and there. Then there is Persona, a movie that seems to have a straightforward narrative but makes you think anyway. This isn't a movie like Mulholland Dr. or something, so the fact that it confuses is actually confusing. It begins with a brilliant opening sequence, which seems to suggest it's beginning at the birth of cinema. It includes random, sometimes subliminal, images flashing across the screen before a white title card with black print appears, reading: Persona. Maybe the movie is held within the title. Persona, singular. Liv Ullmann plays Elisabeth, an actress whom suddenly stopped speaking in the middle of a stage performance. Now in a hospital, a psychiatrist suggest to a twenty-five year old, engaged nurse named Alma (Bibi Andersson) that she spend the summer with Elisabeth in a secluded house. Once there, there's a strange dynamic with Alma doing all the talking and Elisabeth doing all the listening. The patient-caregiver relationship the two have suddenly becomes a much deeper psychic attraction. One scene that occurs, almost without warning, seems to underline this attraction...Elisabeth and Alma's faces combine, like a morph. I think few people will argue that this is one of the great shots in cinema, despite not being incredibly difficult to do. This is the kind of movie that could have been made by many people, but no one could have made it like Bergman did. First off, the movie came out in 1967, well into the \\"color\\" era, even though most filmmakers still hadn't experimented much with color. This movie, if made today by Bergman, would probably still be shot in black-and-white. Most films that use B&W in today's cinema use it for a good reason and for a film like Persona, I don't think itcould be done in color. The cinematography gives it a much more stark, disturbing quality. The movie has aged perfectly, hardly aged at all. It looks like it could've been made this year and digitally drained of color. The performances, also, are incredible; Ullmann says a single sentence in the movie (technically...you'll know what I mean if you've seen the movie) and yet her eyes seem to serve as a way to fuel her performance. There's one stunning scene in Persona, which (from what I've read) it seems most people remember from the movie. Alma tells Elisabeth a story involving a beach, her friend, and two boys. Most writer/directors wouldn't dare write a monologue like this into a film. Not because of the content, but because they would fear it would test the viewer's patience. This scene is more detailed when spoken that it could've been had they filmed it. I could easily explained what Alma had said, as if I'd seen the actual event occur onscreen. Since I've only seen three films by Bergman (The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, and this) and I've only seen them once, I'd have to view this and The Seventh Seal to decide which one is better. Either way, I notice that this film was listed in a book called The 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. And you do. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B000I5X80G|5.0|Incredible that this concert fnally sees the light of day.   I actually attended the concert and I still have the program.   The odd part is that the marquee shows only Neil Young and Miles Davis.  Incidentally, the crowd booed Miles as he played music from Bitches Brew, rock crowds aren't always very discerning. The odd thing about the marquee is that it does not show the second act.   Miles opened, Steve Miller was the second act and Neil was the headliner. <br /> <br />Thanks for all the great music
B000J4QWMC|2.0|when i heard jamie foxx was in this movie i expected greatness because he is such a wonderfull actor,boy was i disappointed.this was 2 hours of the worst acting i have ever seen.the storyline was dragging,the scenes changed to quickly and it was just a long drawn out movie with very little action.the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because even though the movie was not his best jamie foxx looks so good in it.....dont buy this movie wait for cable
0679422714|2.0|Out of curiosity, I borrowed a copy of this book from the local library. It meets my expectation, it is not totally rubbish as other reviewers said. The authors apparently have  put some effort into writing this book. A few of the opinions and arguments raise reasonable doubts. Even though I am still not fully convinced yet.     The major complaints I have with this book are as follows:  1. Most of the stories are not unknown. The authors just put together all the opinions, speculation, rumors which are already around from other sources. I am not saying those stories are true or false. Some of them probably are true. But those stores are not new stuff to most readers who are familiar with Chinese history and politics.   For example, chapter 46, \\"Tibetan rebel\\" is nothing new to me, all the information in the story is widely known to the public already.  I could confidently say out of the 58 so called unknown stories, only about 15-20 are new from the authors. For the other 40 stories, it is a waste of time and money of the readers.    2. Some of the unknown stories really don't make sense to me. For example, chapter 26, \\"Revolutionary opium war\\". This story claims Mao grown and sold opium in order to survive financially. P277 says Yenan region has overcome the financial problem and \\"have accumulated saving... worth $250 Million\\", \\"This sum was six times the official Yenan region budget of 1942\\", The authors continue to claim Mao sold about 2.4 billion of opium in 1943. If you do the math, budget in Yenan region in 1942 was 250,000,000/6=40,000,000.  The revenue of the opium is 58 times of the budget in 1942. The budget shouldn't be too far off actual government revenue, thus the sales of opium is  58 times of the revenue in Yenan, mind you that Yenan is an area bigger than France, the revenue of whole china can't be 58 times of that of Yenan. According to the authors, Mao doesn't sell the opium to his own people in Yenan. Thus if Mao really sold  $2.4 billion of opium, the opium would have been flooded almost everywhere in China or even in East Asia. I am just wondering how this story could have been kept unknown for so long.     3. Some evidences to support the accusation are badly given.  For example, in P24, to claim that Mao cheated on his wife, the authors say: \\"A close friend of His at the time told us this\\". The authors stop short of saying who the close friend was, and how close he was with Mao.     4.  Some sources of references are highly not credible. In P545, there is a story about \\"cannibalism broke out to many parts of the province\\". The source of this story is from a book whose credibility has already been seriously challenged by many scholars.     Bottom line: if you have time to kill, save your money by picking up a copy from your local library.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. The production is perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone who listens to metal. Kahn's vocals and the entire band are in top form. My personal favorite is Elizabeth I, II, and III. Hearing those parts live is great!
B000JJRIN4|1.0|I think Gwen must have been stuck in a room watching The Sound Of Music for the last year. This album is terrible. I wanted so badly to like it but after the tenth listen, i had to give up. Do not waste your money on this album.
0316172324|3.0|Blink is about those first moments whether it's looking at an ancient relic or taste testing Pepsi & Coke.  When applied to this book, my 'blink' was that this is going to be a great book.  As I continued reading, I realize it lacks a huge amount of substance.  For the most part the book is about a concept, blink, followed by numerous examples filling out the book. <br /> <br />About halfway through, I started fearing that I wasn't going to have my curiosity satisfied.  What I was hoping for were some detailed ways we could apply or improve our 'blink' ability.  I wanted something practical, not just an intellectual tease. <br /> <br />Also, some of the things the author says are just unsupported by any facts.  I found him drawing conclusions from certain 'blink' situations, and I'd be able to reason out other conclusions.  Maybe these are all addressed by his sources, but why not explain fewer examples of blink in detail, rather than discussing numerous examples from a shallow perspective?  I'd prefer depth over breadth. <br /> <br />I think many of you will like this book.  As far as being a book about interesting anecdotes/stories, Blink does a solid job.  I think the author is decent (but possibly overrated), so I'll most likely check out the Tipping Point in the future.  However, I tend to be a curious person, and for me this book just didn't go in detail enough.  Sometimes your 'blink' is just wrong.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I first saw Star Wars on HBO when I was 5 years old.  I then bought it on VHS, and rented the DVD's when they came out.  The first couple of times I saw the movie, I was amazed and astounded each time.  But after watching the updated version at the theaters and now on DVD, the movie has lost some of its magic and shine.  Here is why.    First, of all the re-releases, Lucas tweaked A New Hope the most.  Some scenes were added that should have been left out.  The scene with Jabba in the hangar on Tatooine is a good case in point.  Jappa looks way too small, and not quite as brown as he looks in Return of the Jedi.  Also, one of the great things about the original trilogy is the fact that each character has minimal introduction before they appear on screen.  We expected Yoda to be a tall and majestic warrior when Obi-Wan first tells Luke about it, not a midget with long ears.  Likewise, Jabba and his court made a great introduction for Return of the Jedi.  Now that is all spoiled by his appearance in A New Hope.      Second, the special effects of the original A New Hope actually was the most realistic.  They were subtle and helped the movie, but did not carry it.  The special effects of the revised version looked a little too shiny in some places, and somewhat detracts from the supposed \\"feel\\" of the Star Wars world; used and rusty.      Third, there were some parts of the movie that could have been expanded on to make the storyline more believable, but were not.  My example of this is at the end when the X-wing fighters take on the Death Star.  A space station of that size would surely have hundreds of tie fighters that it could launch into space.  The movie shows about two dozen.  One of the attractions of this movie when it first came out was the space shoot-out scenes, and the last one in this movie could have been greatly improved upon.  Also, why didn't the X-wings try attacking the big planet-destroying gun on the Death Star.  It was clearly visible as a big dish on the surface of the Death Star, and the strafing runs by the X-wings proved the Death Star did not have any energy shielding device.  Why not damage the gun first to buy them some time, and then try and destroy the battle station.      Last, with the release of Episodes I, II, and III, Lucas should have used the opportunity to make the storylines of all six movies flow together better.  Specifically, why does Vader sense the force in Luke but not in Leia, especially given the fact that he is in closer proximity to Leia than to Luke.  Or does Vader's force sense become stronger in battle?  Not sure, but would have liked to know.    Overall, this re-release was not worth it for me.  Stuff was added that should not have been, and stuff that should have been added were not.  If you've already bought one copy of A New Hope, I would not bother with this one.  If not, then this would be a good buy.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I haven't always been a fan of John Mayer. There were a few songs that I liked by him, and I thought he was a wonderful guitar player, but I never considered myself a true fan. This album has made me a true fan of John Mayer.    John Mayer shows major maturity on this album. The album is solid from the opening track to the closing one. It evokes a feeling of melancholy and solitude to the listener. But beware fans of John Mayer - his guitar styling is very different on this album. He abandons his acoustic guitar for the sweet sound of blues. It may take awhile for some of his fans to get used to this album, but once you do, you'll find it in heavy rotation.     Often times warm, laid back, blues-y,deep, and melancholic - this album is a must have for any collection. Mayer is one of the few modern day artists who can turn \\"pop\\" lovers to traditional blues. Keep rockin'
B0000047CX|4.0|This CD is famous for helping making the bossa nova popular.  Astrud Gilberto, the novice singer, does a fine job on \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" and \\"Corcovado\\".  This CD is very poppy, but Stan Getz's sax pulls it towards jazz.  He plays with taste and simplicity.  Though the rhythm section of Jobim, Williams, and Banana get credit for making it swing, to me, the songs' rhythms are all pretty similar.
0380789035|5.0|This book is in my top three books of all time, following Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. Part of Gaiman's uniqueness is his exquisite charm. His characters are characters that one genuinely cares about. I went through this thick book in three nights because it is nearly impossible to put down.<br /><br />American God's blends a modern man's struggle through life with ancient gods from roman, celtic, and other mythology, and puts them against \\"modern\\" gods that represent the technology today. What the reader finds his or herself in the middle of is an all out war between the gods of old and new. This book is at times hilarious, at times crushing, and always heartfelt. Gaiman's personification of gods as they would exist today is simply perfect and wonderfully intriguing.<br /><br />This book is a must have for any readers bookshelf. It is beautiful, charming, quirky, mysterious, and above all..magical!
B0000AUHSE|4.0|The history of bringing together superstars is mixed, sometimes people don't mesh the way you'd hope.  In this case, you could've guessed Gary Burton, Chick Corea, and Pat Metheny would be simpatico.  The result is as you'd expect, harmonious jazz songs.  The ideal jazz for me has some blues, or dissonance, or funk, or some impolite parts.  Sometimes my wife likes to call it \\"neurotic\\".  My wife likes this CD, it isn't \\"neurotic\\".  I like it too, it's good, but not the stuff I'd listen to 100% of the time.  \\"Like Minds\\" is my favorite song.  So far I haven't talked about Dave Holland -- his playing is very diverse, and he's great on this CD.  This is the only modern Roy Haynes drumming I have, he's still as good as when he played on Coltrane's \\"Impressions\\".
B00101ZOTA|3.0|better in memory for Kevin Spacey for his line delivery than actually watching or trying to rewatch this kind of unpleasant film.<br /><br />I have no problem with Benicio Del Toro or Peter Postlethwaite but I have never seen an especially enjoyable performance from either one of them.  Kevin Spacey on the other hand was one hundred percent awesome in The Ref.  He's kind of coasting on that  in this film which is only sort of rewatchable for the last half hour of the film and even then he doesn't really punch it - he sort of takes his hands off the steering wheel and lets the film coast to its conclusion.<br /><br />I would say this film is overrated but effectively made the concept of Keyzer Soze unforgettable and as recognizable as &#34;We covet what we see, Clarice.  Everyday.&#34;<br /><br />I never understood the appeal of Gabriel Byrne so his casting like his character is a fake leading man.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Since I don't really know anything much about the \\"real\\" Howard Hughes, I can only review this movie as a movie. I found it engrossing. America is not the world's favourite nation these days. She is seen as something, more than something, of a stupid, greedy, bully, and a sort of control-freak. Many outsiders feel sad about this, because there is still a hope that, underneath that ugly  surface, she still has something good to offer that is struggling to get out. Something about basic decency, plain-dealing and plain-speaking, guts, individualism, technological know-how: the can-do spirit of independence that repudiates the corruption, paranoia and money-madness of the political and corporate  powers that seem to be in control; something of the almost obliterated simple ideals of her founding fathers. For me, this film highlights these two aspects, as they may be perceived by a non-American, both in terms of the plot-line and the study of one man's character. There is still something inspirational about the story of Hughes, as presented in this picture; and I found it gripping, from start to finish. <br /> <br />
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Gwen's new CD, The Sweet Escape, is awesome! The flow of all the songs together is awsome. I'm suprised of all the negative reviews this got. She's talented, pretty, and original. The jerks that say otherwise, are just jealous of how much she's  grown as a musician. Love all the songs, listened to it over 30 times in a row, love the whole \\"Sound of Music\\" theme for \\"Wind it Up\\". Good job Gwen! Love it!
B000JJS8TM|4.0|Ok- so what if it's a remix collage of some of their greatest songs. The arrangments are definitely refreshing and great to listen to as well. One interesting note-according to Espirit's UK website,the LIMITED edition   of the UK audio DVD has extra material that's not on the regular  cd version. I'm not sure if this extra material appears on the USA LIMITED EDITION pressing. Also, it would have been great if the audio DVD had some type of visual animation to accompany the music.  <br />      This is a good album and I recommend it to anyone who likes the Beatles music.
B000001FOL|1.0|There's nothing avant-garde here, and nothing that will benefit from listening with an \\"open mind\\". The problem is not that Nico can't sing. In fact she can, a little. The material lacks style, is waaaay over produced and has none of the genius seen in the Velvet Underground album that made her famous. Than goodness she quit that group. <br /> <br />Save your money. The promoters of this nonsense are the kind of people you read about in The Bonfire of the Vanities.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I don't understand why people are confused by this film.  It's a love story (or maybe not), and love can be a nightmare, a joy, cruel, happy, strange, demented.  I love David Lynch.  I think he's one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of cinema.  I understand this film, but I can't, and don't really want, to expand on its meaning, if it has one.  All I know is that Eraserhead is art.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|For fans of Nancy Meyers (writer-director, SOMETHING's GOTTA GIVE, WHAT WOMEN WANT...), you are in for a big time treat.  This movie is so wildly, over-the-top romantic that it will put you in a state of romantic delirium.  You may never want to come back to the light of day after sitting in the movie theatre with Kate Winslet (never more beguiling), Jude Law (never more impossibly handsome), Jack Black (never more vulnerable) and Cameron Diaz (never more gorgeous).  The Christmas card plot offers plenty of moist-eyed moments as well as flat-out laughs.  I can't remember the last time I loved a sappy movie this much...maybe STEPMOM came close.  Merry Holidays to all...enjoy!
0671015206|4.0|I heard a lot of people mention this book as a comprehensive study on millionaires ever made. Hence I decided to read it. It proved to a very informative and revealing book. <br /> <br />Typically we associate people with large houses and lot of posessions as being wealthy. But this book debunks that myth and show that big spenders are not necessarily wealthy but on the contrary are usually not wealthy. Also, having a large income does not necessarily equate to wealth is yet another myth debunked by the authors. <br /> <br />The authors carried out methodological research on millinaires and present their results in here. They present the patterns seen and show the inherent conclusions. Most of the results show that millionaires are generally made tough and become wealthy by living simple and following solid conservative principles. <br /> <br />The book dives into the demographics of millionaries, their age, where they live, what kind of household they are and such. Also discussed are purchasing patterns of millionaires such as the cars they drive and what they want to do with their estate after they die. <br /> <br />Quite a comprehensive study of millionaires ever made. It also gives me hope and encouragement when the book revealed that 3/4 millionaires as first generation and started from scratch to build wealth. <br /> <br />On conclusion, it is a very information and revealing book on millionaires. Among motivational books, this one is unique in that, instead of big words and quotes it uses facts and data to reveal very useful and encouraging things for anyone who is willing be disciplined and courageous to follow their dreams.
B000024D4R|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this album many years ago.  I first thing that poped into my head is why it took so long for me to hear the album for the first time.  One of THE, if not, the most overlooked albums of the modern rock era.  This is a great album to show off to your buddies who think they know it all. Only true PF fans will know this album.  This is a great one to pull out at the end of a long night to wow those who are left standing.
0743289412|5.0|Written in a stream-of-consciousness prose that at times rivals Dostoevsky at his most introspective, Lisey's Story is a moving tale of love and loss, a fractured story of insanity, and a testament of how we can only stand in this life if we have someone to stand with. And weighing in at just over five hundred pages, it's no light read. I'm not overly familiar with King's earlier works, but judging by the mixed reviews on Amazon, Lisey's Story has been greeted with a rather polarizing response by fans--they either love it because of its heart or hate it because it's almost wholly lacking in the horror elements of his previous writings. <br /> <br />Lisey's Story is unconventional in both style and narrative structure, spending more of its time in the past than in the present, as Lisey - the widow of Pulitzer Prize winner Scott Landon, a perennially bestselling author that at times won't keep you from thinking that perhaps King has written himself into the story -- begins having (and suffering from) flashbacks from her younger days with Scott. All the while, she's being threatened by a madman named Dooley who wants her to give up her dead husband's unfinished manuscripts. <br /> <br />The flashbacks at first focus on their early life together, but then shift to his tragic childhood living in a farmhouse with his strange and brutal father. Each flashback is compelling with its emotion, and each memory sparkles with clarity to Lisey. She begins to wonder if her dead husband is trying to tell her something. <br /> <br />As the story begins to pick up steam in the past, her predicament in the present becomes less and less interesting, practically becoming a subplot--partially because the character of Dooley begins to resemble more and more another literature obsessed villain. (Remember John Shooter in the movie Secret Window based on King's novella?) The two storylines are tied together toward the end, but only loosely. Instead, the author focuses on emotional intensityand the heart rending hopelessness of little Scott's childhood, and one begins to feel that the whole Dooley ordeal could've been left out of the story. <br /> <br />However, I loved King's portrayal of Lisey and Scott's marriage, as well as the alternate reality called Boo'ya Moon that they traveled to for both relief and escape, and how King so adequately shows that even places of utter relief and escape can be just as dangerous as what we're escaping from if we rely on them too much. <br /> <br />So, do I have mixed thoughts about this longwinded novel? Yes. It is at times brilliant, despairing, tired, stunning, and hopeful --- King's prose is absolutely mesmerizing at times. However, Lisey's Story is fractured by its multiple storylines in much the same way as Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood. However, it doesn't destroy the novel. For readers whose stomach is turned by King's use of foul language, Lisey possesses as much as any of his other novels. However, those who love his non-horror works will likely find something to love in Lisey's Story. <br />
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A sweet, funny, touching, look at the year in the life of the Smith family in turn of the century St. Louis the year before the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904. <br /> <br />    The storyline to this movie runs pretty much the same as a soap opera. I feel that the main themes revolve around love, family, and the importance of home.  What holds this movie together so well are the rich production values that just make your eyes pop:  the Smith's family georgeous Victorian house, the exquisite costumes, etc. You're transported back to that bygone era.  Most of all, you have a radiant, delightful, and positively beaming Judy Garland, at a high point(she had many) in her life.  The director (Minelli) new exactly what he wanted to achieve and how to showcase Judy at her absolute best. <br /> <br />    I enjoyed how  realistic and wacky Minelli made the different characters in this movie.   I loved how morbid Tootie was, how Grandpa was funny, yet how he always had the right words to smooth over the rough patches, how big sisters Rose and Esther(Garland) would way over-dramatize their love-lifes.(Dont we all?)  The actors were all great. <br /> <br />   Best of all was the fabulous score and now classic songs written expressly for Judy Garland. Here are my favorite scenes: <br />   1. Esther(Judy) and Tootie overlooking the snow people in the garden, while Esther sings \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.\\" <br />   2. Realizing she will be leaving her beloved St Louis behind, in a flash of tears and rage Tootie runs outside and proceeds to bash in all her snow people. <br />   3. Esther being tresseled up in her corset on the night of the Christmas ball. Boy, Judy was really skinny! <br />   4. John Truitt chasing down the trolley to be with Esther. <br />   5. Esther belting out the \\"Trolley Song\\". Just amazing. <br />   6. John Truitt exclaiming\\" It's no worse than football practice. Except its better with a girl.\\" <br />   7. Esther(Judy) exclaiming, \\"One sister going with her brother has been done, but two sisters makes the family look ridiculous! I won't do it! <br />   8.  I love how Minelli opens each season ;summer, fall, winter,and spring, like a picture on the cover of a greeting card. <br />   9.  I would love to have a crotchety, loveable maid like the venerable Marjorie Main.  Back in those days, they had to make their own catsup. <br />  10.  At the Christmas ball, Esther begins to dance around the Christmas tree with her Grandpa. When she comes around the other side, she has her beau, John Truitt, in her arms. <br /> <br />   There are many other scenes that may be or may become your favorite moments from this wonderful, timeless, classic suitable for the whole family. Whatever they are, this movie should not be forgotten. MMISL is for musical and classic movie lovers alike. Buy this movie for your own essential movie library.  You and your family will soon be choosing your own favorite moments from this terrific American classic! <br /> <br />P.S.  \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Chistmas\\" will lovingly endure as one of Judy's best remembered songs. It is legendary how she hated the original song that went something like \\"have yourself a merry little Christmas, it may be our last ...\\"  She refused to sing such a morbid song until the writers changed it into its current, more hopeful state. Judy was absolutely incandescent when she sang that song in MMISL. For the die-hard Garland fans, a rare clip of Judy from the \\"Tonight\\" show with Johnny Carson can be viewed on Youtube.  Simply type in Judy Garland Till After The Holidays. In this rare clip Judy sings \\"Till After the Holidays\\", a heartbreaking, and touching song written expressly for her by Jonathan Meyer.  In this clip, she is still simply Judy; that moving, feeling , genuine artist that can wet the most driest of eyes.  The holiday that this was filmed was Judy's last Christmas.  May she rest in peace.
0375703861|4.0|Archie Jones, a white working class Englishman and Samad Iqbal, a Bangladeshi Muslim, have been friends since their days as army buddies during World War II.  Both received permanent injuries during their service and both tended to live in the past.  There is Archie's second wife, Clara, who is Jamaican and the daughter of Hortense Bowden, a very observant Jehovah's Witness.  Samad is married to Alsana, who, like her husband is from Bangladesh.  They have identical twin sons, Millat and Magid, who are as different from each other as apples and oranges.  Where Millat was a handsome, somewhat frivolous ladies' man, who later gets involved with an extremist Muslim group, Magid was serious minded, scholarly, interested in scientific experimentation, and completely non-religious.  The Jones' daughter, Irie, racially mixed and very bright and sensitive, was infatuated with the undeserving Millat.    Enter the Chalfens--Marcus, a Jewish scientist involved with a controversal genetic engineering project, and June, his Christian wife, who loved botany.  Their son, Josh, was a classmate of Millat and Irie, who are both \\"semi-adopted\\" by Josh's parents (much to Josh's consternation) as a form of social engineering.  Clara, and especially the naturally suspicious Alsana, viewed the Chalfen's efforts as meddlesome--or worse.    Zadie Smith has written a wise and extraordinarily funny book.  The parts concerning Magid sitting with his jeans on in a bathtub filled with water and Joyce's comments to Alsana's lesbian niece and her girlfriend are laugh out loud funny.  Sometimes the characters are a bit comic bookish--as are two of the domino playing denizens of O'Connell's Bar, Samad's efforts to have his so-called \\"revolutionary hero\\" great grandfather's portrait hung there, and Archie's being so indecisive that he cannot make a decision without flipping a coin.  Ms. Smith, though, has a wonderful ear for dialogue and a real feel for adolescent angst.    Racial, ethnic, religious,and moral tensions reach a crescendo, with an inevitable clash near the end of the book.  As in real life, the combatants find a specific focus for their hostilities.  What ultimately happens may or may not have been a product of someone's hallucination.
B000INAXGU|5.0|I loved Jamiroquai for a long time .. actually way back in the mid 1990's, and now I am caught up in their magic again. This cd is wonderful! their music is full of everything you would want in a cd.. sure to please in every way and I dare you not to get up off your chair and dance around your room, it's hard not too. <br />Jason Kay has a wonderful funky voice and you inctantly feel the energy right through your stereo speakers..

B000JK8OYU|2.0|The Beatles are my favorite band ever... but this CD is a rip-off.. \\"The Beatles as you've never heard them before\\"... yeah right! They should state on the album title that it's just a remix and dissecting of songs.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|In search of some new music to listen to, I borrowed a couple of CD's from a Co-worker.  One of the CD's I grabbed was \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\". I'd heard some good things about Panic! At The Disco and I was completely ready to like this album; until I listened to it.  What I heard didn't impress me.    These guys are basically a pop-punk/emo fusion with a dance beat.  Someone else who posted a review here mentioned their use of instruments that don't appear in the genre often, and that is true... but I somehow suspect that has more to do with the producer than the band.  The last song on the album was the most interesting one, but it almost reminded me of \\"Mr. Bungle\\"-lite; genre changing just for the sake of it.  From the looks of the comments here I'm pretty well outside the target demographic for this album, so that might explain my dislike of it.  That said I can think of a few hundred albums I would recommend before this one.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Don't even read the reviews just press the buy me button and prepare to watch the whole of Season Two of Lost in less than a week if not a few days. The DVD box sets are one hell of a way to watch Lost. Those who sat through the episodes as they aired will admit that as one of the biggest selling TV series DVD box sets in history (also see `Firefly' for similar achievements) is better than the best of the stuff out there (at least 99% of it). Lost is comprised of some of the best sitcoms of the twentieth-century. It is part `ER', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' with real drama and yet totally unique in every conceivable way and form. Lost Season 2 is every bit as good as Season 1 and then some more because lots of important questions do get answered and a lot of things are revealed to you. Like Season 1, Season 2 of Lost will catch you hook, line and sinker. This will put a stop on every other media you watch or listen to for the next couple of days. The logistics of LOST are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island we realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them. In Season 1 we are left with the bigger questions of Who are the Others? What is down the hatch? What is that strange monster? While Season 2 does have an episode about the monster, and more is revealed, Season 2 is focused on the Others and the hatch, two stories which combine well and introduce a new wave of characters. Don't worry if you feel that the writers of LOST may be playing with the story to make more money, yes of course they are, if it could go to Season 20 they probably would, but things are gelling and there is a clear narrative and by the end of Season 2 you will be orientated a lot better. Even questions like why are there higher levels of psychic phenomena on the island get answered. With that said and done even though there is much in Lost that can be rationally explained, a whole hunk of it will leave you Lost and bewildered. It may be as painful as having a tooth extraction waiting for the answer to any of the major questions but they come. Of course there is the death clock element. People will die. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? You just don't know how things will go. The seven degrees of separation instead becomes one degree as everybody has a distinctive relationship with everyone else, including you. The ethnic variations of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer. In a day and age when television is boring there is nothing quite like Lost, nor will there be for some time to come. Yes we can complain that this can drag on to keep the bucks flowing but even Firefly only lasted one season. So let's hope the series gets a good few box sets together before the producers know when to call it a day on delivering on what it all means... and they better!go to Season 20 they probably would, but things are gelling and there is a clear narrative and by the end of Season 2 you will be orientated a lot better.

B000IY03CS|5.0|George Michael! The voice! This is smoothest velvet! I would have given this album a 100 stars if I could. This is all the essential George Michael that you will need. The album is spread on 3 discs. <br /> <br />Disc 1:- All the fast paced songs by George in this disc entitled, \\"For Living\\". It starts off with the Wham! laced superhit, \\"Everything she wants\\", covers material from all his future albums and ends with the newly released single \\"An easier affair\\". This album is cool and you can see how his music evolved from \\"Wake me up...\\" to \\"Shoot the Dog\\". It's really amazing to hear so much variation within a single disc. <br /> <br />Disc 2:- All the softer and tender songs. What a disc! It's called, \\"For Loving\\". Starts off with his classic, \\"Careless Whisper\\", weaves its way through \\"Father Figure\\", \\"Don't let the sun...\\", \\"Jesus to a child\\", \\"Praying for time\\" and ends with the new amazing duet with Mutya called, \\"This is not real love\\". The song is simply spellbinding and what a fitting end to a mesmerizing disc. One thing I don't understand is why the record companies edit the intro of \\"Careless Whisper\\". The intro really brings out alive the mood of the song  and its such a soul touching tune. The intro of this classic is deleted in all the compilations including this compilation.This disc is breathtaking in its scope and has all the songs which you love. Need I say more?! <br /> <br />Disc 3:- His introspecetive disc called, \\"For the loyal\\". These are his more compex songs with deeper meaning and they are all classics! This disc could have been made even better by including some songs from \\"Faith\\" or \\"Listen without Prejudice\\". It's still stellar! <br /> <br />100 stars overall! <br /> <br />This collection is a improvement over \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" as it has a lot of new songs as well as songs from \\"Patience\\", also covers of classics like \\"Roxanne\\". I highly recommend this album. Its worth its weight in gold! Don't walk, run to get this! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0316166685|5.0|I picked up this book from the rack in the drug store because I needed a a mindless read for a long plane ride.  I had heard none of the hype about it, and knew nothing of the author.  This book was an amazing surprise to me, and I was hooked from the beginning.      I now understand that the author speaks with authority and personal experience on the topic of attack and rape.  Her account of Susie's rape and death are searing and sad, but not so overwhelming that I needed to stop reading. The focus of this book in not horror.    The theme that I related to the most in the book, and consider to be central, is that of grieving.  I saw the characters used by the author to explore and illustrate aspects of grief that we all go through as we deal with the long process of adjusting to life after the loss of a loved one.  I recommend this book to anyone who is grieving or who wants to understand more about the grieving process.     I found this book to be beautifully written; dreamlike and poetic at times.  Each character is painted and developed with great depth, and I saw a piece of myself and others I have known in each of them.  I loved that Grandma Lynn was the unlikely heroine - maybe what we sometimes mock in our elders turns out to be a wisdom honed from their own past hurts.    Rarely do I reread a book, but this one was even richer on the second reading.  Rarely do I feel the need to highly recommend a paperback that I picked up on a whim to kill time on a plane, but this book is exceptional in every way.

B000JJRIO8|4.0|I LOVE THE NEW ALBUM BY 2PAC AND ITS ONE OF THE BEST ONES SINCE HE PASSED AWAY
1932100660|5.0|It's about nutrition and chronicle diseases (heart, cancer, diabetes, etc.). A highly readable book, from the medical angle as well as from societal angle. <br /> <br />Here is shock #1: Protein in milk promotes cancer.  Unbelievable?  It's proven in animal trials and observed in human population study.  The book presents findings of many researchers, including a large scale study on nutrition and chronicle disease done in China by Dr. Campbell (hence the title China study). <br /> <br />The author grew up on a farm (milking cows when he was a boy), became a well-trained, well respected and well funded research scientist at Cornell and participated in national-level nutrition policy making.  He found convincing evidence through decades of research (funded by NIH, etc.) that switching to a plant-based food can reduce risk of top killers in the U.S. (heart diseases, cancer, etc.) and even stop and reverse them!.  Ha! <br /> <br />So basically he calls for veggie diet (the whole-foods type, not the pasta, sugar and cookie type). <br /> <br />This is not a big news to many people.  But I was really surprised by how readable his book is and how reasonable he is, addressing all possible suspicious aroused by his stunning conclusions.  He was suspicious himself in the beginning and cautious in conducting his research. He asked  \\"Am I crazy?\\" after he discovered the protein intake positively correlated with liver cancer in children in the Philippines, where he went to promote \\"good nutrition\\" by adding more protein in their diet.  He then explained the solid follow-up research he conducted (all peer reviewed and funded by NIH and other reputable organizations). <br /> <br />He also spends maybe 50% of the text on powerful influences from industry as well as the medical profession itself that prevent research results like this to reach the public.  For example, in Cleveland Clinic, the renowned heart-disease treatment center, some senior staff doctors and trustees, having heart problems themselves, go to see Dr. Esselstyn.  Dr. Esselstyn was a top-ranked surgeon in the world. However these patients went to see Dr. Esselstyn not for his surgical skills, but for his plant-based nutrition treatment.  Dr. Esselstyn, despite all awards he got during his successful career (in fact top earner in department of general surgery for over ten years!), he came to realize that without a change in diet, all the surgery and drugs didn't prolong patients lives, didn't reduce their chances of heart problem after these treatments.  So he conducted a study of 18 patients following a low-fat, plant-based diet.  Their heart diseases were reversed! Yet he couldn't get the Clinic to use his program to treat heart patients.  So he had to set up his own practice.  Then words get out  and apparently the senior staff doctor and trustees KNEW this is a better option than surgery - many of them seeked help from Dr. Esselstyn.  YET THEY STILL DON'T ALLOW DR. Esselstyn''s program to enter the Cleveland Clinic!!! <br /> <br />Wow! That's something, huh? <br /> <br />But think about it, it makes sense.  Doctors are people, they need to make money to pay for houses, children's education, etc.  If you tell them just by eating a true whole-foods veggie diet, people can avoid and indeed reverse heart diseases and various cancers, which the medical man cannot do yet, then their skills, and therefore their earning power, are rendered worthless.  I wouldn't be happy if I were a heart surgery or cancer specialist.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|Based on P. D. James' novel of the same title, Alfonso Cuaron made a futuristic action/thriller, which opens with a strange news report about a shocking death of 'the world's youngest man.' The film is set in England, now chaotic country in the year of 2027. No child has been born for 18 years in the world and the country witnessed the widening gap between those who have and those who do not. Humans are going to be extinct very slowly.    [STORY] Clive Own plays a quiet businessman Theodore, a former activist whose ex-lover (and now the leader of anti-government group called FISH) Julian (Julianne Moore) suddenly shows up before him and asks him to do an impossible thing for her. She says her organization needs a government's pass to secretly transport a woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of England, who is, she believes, the only hope to save the world from destruction.     [ACTORS] Though Julianne Moore is second-billed, and her character plays an important role in the story, hers is actually an extended cameo. Michael Caine effectively plays an ex-hippie Jasper (with a long hair which might look a bit strange) who gives a help to Theo, and there are supporting actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, Danny Huston and Peter Mullan, but the film basically belongs to two actors Clive Owen and Claire-Hope Ashitey.    [VISUALLY STUNNING] You should not miss two long continuous shots, one of which goes on more than 10 minutes. Besides these technical things, Alfonso Cuaron, with Emmanuel Lubezki very realistic photography, succeeds in creating a bleak view of the world that reminds us of recent news footages from Iraq. The director refuses to use his trademark green color here. Instead he uses grey-colored images that captures the brooding atmosphere of the future with no hope. And don't forget this; the film is sometimes violent, showing spluttered blood on the lense.    Clive Owen is very good as reluctant hero and so are other actors, whose acting almostmakes up for the film's flawed script. Though I have not read the original book, Alfonso Cuaron clearly changed it to make the film's theme more immediate. That is fine, but still the plot suffers from some incredible coincidences (which I cannot reveal here) and some gaps in logics. To me Cuaron's vision about the strife-torn land of England, where refugees are treated in the places that look like concentration camps, are convincing only visually -- why do people rush to England when Theo and Kee must leave? Is there a better place outside there? These and other details remain hazy.    Though the film is set in the near future, it is clearly about our time. The film is visually stunning, especially during the battles (don't miss the driving scene) and you also get the original music by John Tavener, but the more detailed logics in plot would have made it a better film. Still the film's intense and impressive images cannot be easily forgotten.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|(Taken from reviews originally written in the 1960's by Tony Palmer, John Mendelsohn and William Mann)  <br /> <br />Compiled, rearranged and enhanced by Me  <br /> <br />\\"If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney along with George Harrison are the greatest songwriters since Schubert, then today - with the publication of the Beatles new double LP- should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making, which only the ignorant will not hear and only the deaf will not acknowledge. Called simply Love, it's wrapped in a bright yellow cover which is adorned with the song titles and those four red silhouettes, silhouettes which for some still represent the menace of long haired youth, for others the great hope of a cultural renaissance and for others the desperate, apparently endless struggle against cynical so-called betters.  <br /> <br />\\"Come Together\\" is John Lennon very nearly at the peak of his form; twisted, freely-associative, punful lyrically, pinched and somehow a little smug vocally. Breathtakingly recorded (as is the whole album), with a perfect little high-hat-tom-tom run by Ringo providing a clever semi-colon to those eerie shooo-ta's, Timothy Leary's campaign song is placed near the end of the album in grand fashion indeed.  <br /> <br />George's vocal, containing less adenoids and more grainy Paul tunefulness than ever before, is one of many highlights on his \\"Something,\\" some of the others being more excellent drum work, a dead catchy guitar line, perfectly subdued strings, and an unusually nice melody. Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it.  <br /> <br />\\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" lead us from there into a dreamy John number, \\"Gnik Nus,\\" in which we find him singing for the Italian market, words like amore and felice giving us some clue as to the feel of this reminiscent-of-\\"In My Room\\" ballad sung backwards.  <br /> <br />George Harrison's \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" carries the manner of Indian music farther into pop than ever before though the tune of the song is recognizably mixolydian; there are hints of Indian atmosphere in some of the other songs (mostly by Lennon and McCartney.)  <br /> <br />Psychedelia can be diagnosed in the fanciful lyric and intriguing asymmetrical music of \\"Lucy In The Sky,\\" as well as in the sound effects of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", and the hurricane glissandi of \\"A Day In The Life\\" which has been banned by the BBC for its ambivalent references to drug taking-though if anything on the record is going to encourage dope it is surely the \\"tangerine trees and marmalade skies\\" and the \\"girl with kaleidoscope eyes\\" in \\"Lucy In The Sky\\" which contains none of these woosh noises.  <br /> <br />That the Beatles can unify seemingly countless musical fragments and lyrical doodlings into a uniformly wonderful suite, as they've done on side two, seems potent testimony that no, they've far from lost it, and no, they haven't stopped trying.  <br /> <br />No, on the contrary, they've achieved here the closest thing yet to Beatles freeform, fusing more diverse intriguing musical and lyrical ideas into a piece that amounts to far more than the sum of those ideas. \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" for example, would come off as quite mediocre on its own, but just watch how John and especially Paul build on its mood of perky childlike wonder. Like here, in \\"Because,\\" is this child, or someone with a child's innocence, having his mind blown by the most obvious natural phenomena, like the blueness of the sky. Amidst, mind you, beautiful and intricate harmonies, the like of which the Beatles have not attempted since \\"Free As A Bird.\\"  <br /> <br />Then, just for a moment, we're into Ringo's \\"Octopus's Garden,\\" which seems like a daydream of an underwater fantasy. Allowed to remain pensive only for an instant, we're next transported, via Paul's \\"Lady Madonna\\" with boogie-woogie piano in this happy paean to the glories of motherhood: \\"Lady Madonna, Children at your feet, wonder how you manage to make ends meet...\\"  <br /> <br />And then, before we know what's happened, we're into George's melancholy \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" a gentle ballad on par with the greatest of the Lennon/ McCartney songbook. A perfect epitaph for our visit to the world of Beatle daydreams: \\"I look at the world and I notice it turning...\\" And just for the record, John's going to inform us that \\"All You Need Is Love\\".  <br /> <br />Any of these songs is more genuinely creative than anything currently to be heard on pop radio stations, but in relationship to what other groups have done lately LOVE is chiefly significant as constructive criticism, a sort of pop music master class examining trends and correcting or tidying up inconsistencies and undisciplined work, here and there suggesting a line worth following. The new exploration is the showband manner of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and the \\"Sgt. Pepper's Reprise\\", and its interval song, \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.\\" These three give a certain shape and integrity to the two sides, and if the unity is slightly specious the idea is, I think, new to pop song LPs, which are usually unconnected anthologies, and it is worth pursuing. Sooner or later some group will take the next logical step and produce an LP which is a pop-song -cycle, a Tin Pan Alley Dichterliebe. Whether or not the remains of Schumann and Heine turn in their graves at this description depends on the artistry of the compiler.  <br /> <br />I'd hesitate to say anything's impossible for George and Giles Martin after listening to LOVE the first thousand times, and the others aren't far behind. To my mind, they're equatable, but still unsurpassed.\\"

B00003CWPL|5.0|I am surprised that this film seems to be embraced by the mainstream. Who would have guessed?<br /><br />Well, if you are open to mind-bending, expirimental, dark art, then this is among the creme of the crop. Eraserhead is one of those films that may mean different things to different folk.<br /><br />Me, as a simpleton I pretty much just enjoy the dark visuals and sort of apply them to my own dreams and experiences. I can see the argument that it tackles the fears, changes and sacrifice involved in becoming a parent, but prefer to see it as meaningless in the most meaningful way imaginable.
0670038040|5.0|Once again Mr. Mortimer has graced us with a Rumpole novel, and this one is a bit different. Normally we only get the story from Rumpole's point of view, but this time out there is a counterpoint from the memoirs being written by his long-suffering wife Hilda (or \\"She Who Must Be Obeyed\\"). The new angle puts some life into Hilda's character, and also allows us to see the more human side of the judges who are constantly being castigated by Rumpole. The main story itself is quite interesting, although even a moderately discerning reader can solve the question of guilt fairly early on in the story. That's not really the point of these books: rather it is Rumpole's querelous view of the world and just about everybody else in it. May he go on to tackle many more interesting cases.
B000000HHE|5.0|The Long Island trio De La Soul's debut \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\" is one of the most original, different rap albums you will ever hear. It's so creative and humorous and is just so great in so many ways. The album ushered in a new movement of thought in rap music. De La Soul took a very light and humorous approach to hip hop at a time where the angry, hard rappers seemed to be all there was. Posdnous and Trugoy are still truly talented and intelligent MCs, though, and they cover some relevant social topics despite their constant humor. Musically this album is also great, the sampling and horns are so catchy and always keep my head bobbing when I listen to this. This sound would be imitated a lot throughout the nineties, and for good reason. This album was also among the first to do the whole skit/interlude concept on a rap album, with an intro and outro and interludes throughout the disc. There are a lot of short songs here, contributing to the albums 24 song tracklist. Along with Jungle Brothers, this was among the first of the Native Tongues movement, and it was a trendsetter and a pioneer. This album is really funny and has a lot of replay value, it's one of the most original and important rap albums and one I recommend to all.<br /><br />After the games show-themed intro, the album begins with \\"The Magic Number,\\" an immensely fun and catchy song that sets the mood well. \\"Change in Speak\\" has great horns and a jazzy, funky beat with good raps. \\"Can U Keep a Secret?\\" is one of the short songs that I mentioned that is just really funny, it always makes me laugh. \\"Jenifa Taught Me\\" tells an awkward story of high school, like always it is well produced and humorous. The excellent \\"Ghetto Thang\\" and one of my favorite old school songs ever, \\"Eye Know,\\" follow. \\"Eye Know\\" has a beautiful beat, with an inescapably catchy whistle and instrumental as well as a great hook, the raps are laidback and happy and the song is just great. The short \\"Take It Off\\" and \\"A Little Bit of Soap\\" precede \\"Tread Water,\\" a relevant metaphorical track that chronicles conversations the rappers had with animals in the jungle. \\"Potholes in My Lawn\\" is more vintage De La, as are \\"Say No Go\\" and \\"Plug Tunin'.\\" \\"Buddy\\" introduced A Tribe Called Quest to the world, and \\"Me Myself and I\\" is undoubtedly one of hip hop music's finest tracks. The encouraging lyrics are one of a kind, and the horns and chorus are still widely known even almost twenty years later, this track is so catchy and well produced. The album ends with four more tracks that really hold their weight and end the album on a great note, including \\"This Is a Recording 4 L.I.F.E.,\\" \\"D.A.I.S.Y. Age,\\" and another mix of \\"Plug Tunin'.\\"<br /><br />I think \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\" is a classic on the level of some of the east coast's best, and even though today it might be a little dated and often overlooked it's still really fun to listen to. This album showed better than any other that hip hop music could just be plain fun. I recommend it to anyone with taste for older and creative hip hop music, it's a great addition for any collection.t of Soap\\" precede \\"Tread Water,\\" a relevant metaphorical track that chronicles conversations the rappers had with animals in the jungle. \\"Potholes in My Lawn\\" is more vintage De La, as are \\"Say No Go\\" and \\"Plug Tunin'.\\" \\"Buddy\\" introduced A Tribe Called Quest to the world, and \\"Me Myself and I\\" is undoubtedly one of hip hop music's finest tracks.

B000GY729M|3.0|`Sam's Town' is The Killers' follow-up to 2004's `Hot Fuss.' That latter album was quite the monster throughout the world with rich production values - showing enormous vision and competency on the part of the band and its production team - that clearly showed how deeply The Killers were in thrall to British influences as diverse as The Fall, U2, and Oasis. But, had `Hot Fuss' been nothing more than an imitative and/or derivative paean to Britpop, it would likely have died like an unwanted hooker on the streets of Las Vegas. But, the music - while familiar - was part of an atmospheric aural vehicle that carried dense, thoughtful narratives about relationships and their demands and responsibilities.<br /><br />The explosive success of `Hit Fuss' resulted in The Killers becoming a world-wide phenomenon that was heavy rotation on both sides of the pond. Among the events the band had as campaign streamers were Glastonbury, Live 8, Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Late Show with David Letterman, Top of the Pops as well as a host of edgier shows; quite a step ahead for a band that was formed in 2002.<br /><br />Along the way the band has gained some notoriety for what might be referred to as rock star bravado. Between claims that the follow-up album would be \\"one of the best albums in the past twenty years,\\" to critical, caustic comments about other bands, some have wondered 1) is the band full of themselves and 2) can they deliver an equally strong second offering.<br /><br />I'm here to say that the answers to these questions are \\"Yes,\\" and \\"possibly no.\\" While `Sam's Town' does contain some strong insightful observations on life, music and the cost of stepping out on the notional global stage, when one views the CD as a whole, it is less consistent in song quality. There is also a decided shift in some of the underlying foundations from which this band draws its inspiration.<br /><br />Where `Hot Fuss' was the band's view of Britpop, \\"Sam's Town' has a strong element of American influence. This is most obvious in \\"When You Were Young,\\" and \\"This River is Wild;\\" both hark to the wall-of-sound thunder of `Born to Run.' There are also nods to Bon Jovi in \\"Uncle Jonny,\\" which - while coming down against cocaine - takes a somewhat sympathetic view of the abuser. After several listens, I had to conclude that the band was talking about someone they know.<br /><br />The overall album is a bit of a concept product, too. The title song addresses the issue of success, with its chorus \\"You know I see London, I see Sam's Town/pulls my hand and lets my hair down/Rolls the world right off my shoulder/I see London, I see Sam's Town,\\" delivering a retrospective view of what success entails in terms of prices to be paid.<br /><br />The next nine songs are contained within a song cycle structure that starts and finishes with \\"Enterlude\\" and \\"Exitlude,\\" respectively. They set the stage - in tone and content quite similar to the works of Ray Davies - for the aforementioned nine songs that follow the band's penchant for analytical study about relationships. However, whereas `Hot Fuss' was about interpersonal relationships, \\"Sam's Town' addresses the more problematic issue of being in rock `n' roll. This is not to say that you will be listening to a concept album. The songs are not linked in that manner. (So, it is not Endless Wire/Wire and Glass!). But, you are aware that Flowers et al have been doing some thinking about whom and what they are. The problem I'm faced with is that the issue remains unresolved as to whether the band is looking back with some yearning for a simpler time even with its implied lack of success, or whether they are thinking about their position as legends in their own minds.<br /><br />It is this latter concept that pushed forward when I listen to the Springsteen/Bon Jovi based material. That bombast can - if not truly heartfelt - end up being just that: bombast. I would also comment that Flowers' vocal range does not fully encompass this style. His voice shreds on a couple of tracks, particularly on \\"For Reasons Unknown.\\"<br /><br />Overall, 'Sam's Town' is a very good sophomore effort, but one where style and content are a bit erratic.cularly on \\"For Reasons Unknown.\\"    Overall, 'Sam's Town' is a very good sophomore effort, but one where style and content are a bit erratic.
B00003CXA2|1.0|More like Forrest Chump. And damn if Gump and Co. don't set out in righteous fashion to dumb down American society, perhaps to its rightful place in the discarded fish pile. Christians, more than any other ethnic group, should take great offense at this ripoff of their Jesus Christ mascot. A hollow shell sucking up all the limelight. A guru made out of papier mache. &$#^$*#!! And people, I recall, went nuts over this sunken dung rag when it turded into theaters. Viewed in a certain light, Forrest is nothing more than the bible-soaked fantasy of the meek inheriting the Earth. Perhaps that's the allure: Weak, midwestern church zombies shuffling through the ticket line and staring up at a screen in which they've substituted their bloated, watered-down personas in place of Gump, himself a talking stuffed-doll acting as masturbatory extension of Americana. Like an apple pie that confers, \\"So how about that weird weather we've been having?\\" or \\"Go Niners, right?\\" when you take a bite. Skip this abomination and just watch \\"Gump Fiction,\\" Which at least has a couple shootouts.
006054094X|2.0|...upon actual research it is clearly false. Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking: <br /> <br />1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange. <br /> <br />2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence. <br /> <br />3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island \\"mystery\\" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues. <br /> <br />4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect. <br /> <br />Ultimately Menzies' book is entertaining, leaving the reader hoping it is true merely for the fantastic nature of the thesis. In the end, however, the evidence and analysis simply are not there.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|Finally, somebody decides to take filmmaking to the next level. The X-level, yo, as in Xtreme! And it's multicultural, so that scores it boocoo points. You get to learn about our sister country, Japan. It sure seems hectic, but hey it's hectic anyway when you got a dad who's so mean and your mom ships you off because you like putting the petal to the medal. Step aside, \\"Rebel Without A Cause\\" ... \\"Tokyo Drift\\" is coming through and there's definitely not a cause in sight. I can't believe those turns, dog. This joint is worth the 5 stars just for that rubber-scrubbing factor alone.
B000BB96LM|5.0|Come on we all know Johnny is hot but he makes the perfect part in the movie! I mean I like this one a whole lot more because Charlies cuter and not ugly and also because all the other kids just fit the parts way better than the original! I am totaly giveing it 5 stars he kicked at the part! Also when Violit turns purple she actully looks purple not just a light coming over her!!! People rent it Johnnys a pro
B000000WA4|5.0|As sacrilegious as this sounds, the first song I ever heard by The Smashing Pumpkins was `Bullet with Butterfly Wings' and the second Billy uttered the words \\"the world is a vampire\\" I was hooked.  Now I will admit that as a whole The Smashing Pumpkins are the type of band that you love or you hate.  My wife is in the one extreme where you hate the very thought of listening to Billy's whiny voice, whereas I am utterly compelled to listen to everything they release, and while I may not be enthralled by everything I am still in love with this essential Pumpkins album.  With killer tracks like `Zero', `Love' (on of my favorites), `An Ode to No One', `Bullet with Butterfly Wings' and `Muzzle' clouding up disc 1 and then hits like `1979', `Tales of a Scorched Earth', `We Only Come out at Night' and `X.Y.U.' on Disc 2, `Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness' will go down as the most passionate and most memorable Pumpkins album to date, serving as a staple to any fan of the band.  I can almost guarantee that if you are a passing fan, the song you love is on this album!
B00000IQC8|2.0|I cannot see why this trashy movie got such a high rating, except that as a culture we've accepted vulgarity and rudeness as being funny. While Kevin Smith seems capable of providing intelligent dialog for his characters, he opts for mostly shock effect. Howard Stern would be proud. Some reviewers said the movie was good because it captured the ethos of low-paid clerks, but I think it was more about two obscene idiots manning a store. There was one part of the movie I found hilarious, though: when the cat took a dump on the counter in front of the customer. The expressions on both the animal's and the customer's faces were priceless. This movie is definitely not for kids!! <br />
B00005JKN9|3.0|`Gangs of New York' is definitely not a great movie, but it's not as bad as some have labeled it either.  It's certainly long enough, although with a film of this epic grandeur it probably could have used some more battle time.  The weakness in this film falls in the hands of lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio who fails miserably to command his role.  He lets Daniel Day-Lewis run away with the entire show, and run he does.  As Bill `The Butcher' Cutting, Day-Lewis is at his most charismatic and impressive, chewing up every ounce of scenery at his disposal, and at an almost three-hour running rate he has quite a bit of time at hand. <br /> <br />The film takes place in 1863 and revolves around Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) as he strives to avenge his father's death at the hands of Bill Cutting.  Leo never quite develops his character fully and leaves the viewer a bit tired of seeing him.  The plot drags out a bit too much and I found myself growing bored unless I was watching Day-Lewis chew, chew and chew some more.  Cameron Diaz does well but the film has little use for her and it shows except for one scene involving a knife throwing scene with Daniel where their chemistry is bright and she makes good for herself. <br /> <br />This isn't, as I mentioned, a great movie but it's a decent one that has its share of good moments, most of which include the aforementioned Daniel Day-Lewis.  This film also sports a rich cast of supporting players like John C. Reilly (just love him) and Jim Broadbent and of course is rich and beautifully shot by none other than acclaimed director Martin Scorsese who proves once again why he's so well loved.  It's not a movie you'll hate, but you may end up scratching your head as to how it received 10 Oscar nominations, most shocking being that Best Picture nod that could have gone elsewhere.
B000JKA0B0|1.0|I believe whomever is incharge of pricing the band's music needs to rethink who they are selling to.  My kids - as well as myself love Rammstein but I will not pay this amount for four cds to any band.   <br />I thought the newsletter said it would be $102.  I could somehow work with that but this amount of 171.99 is too much.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I'll admit, I've never been a big Gwen Stefani fan, but then I saw her live with No Doubt and even this rock and roll girl couldn't deny what a force Gwen Stefani was on live. That's how I'm usually won over by any music performer. If they can pull it off live, then I'm usually won over. No, I didn't run out and buy No Doubt cds but I stopped lumping them with the rest of the formulaic crap that exists on the radio these days, and I actually began to enjoy hearing their music.  <br /> <br />Then, she comes out with her first solo record, I was a bit taken back. There really was no need for her to step into the world of hip-hop or try to any way, but she did. For that I give her credit, as I would give any artist who is willing to do something new.  <br /> <br />With this new record however, I'm surprised that anyone can listen to it and pretend that it's close to anything she is actually capable of doing. I think she could definatley have done better. I planned on downloading songs for my neice who likes all of these bubbly girl acts as most tweenage girls do. The ability to listen to downloads can be help or a hinderance when it comes to music. But, in this case, it helped me because I knew for sure that I didn't like the cd. I ended up not downloading anything (some of these songs are also not for young teens although the music is absolutely geared towards them).  I just don't get why Gwen Stefani found the need to do this record. She certainly didn't need to. Wind it Up and Fergilicious are almost interchangable in sound to me (except for the take on the Sound of Music--which I find most annoying--nothing personal against Gwen's yodle, more than the Sound of Music being my most hated musical). Also, both songs are quite weak. The videos look identical as well. Loads of people running around the scantly dressed divas, while they chant the same lines over and over again, mixed in with a few silly quips about how the boys love to look at them. <br /> <br />I read that Gwen Stefani said she planned to start working on her next record with No Doubt...good for her, because personally, for me, that's where she shines best.  That is why I'm rating this with 2 stars (1 for effort, and 1 for the promise of a new record with No Doubt) <br /> <br />'No Doubt'(no pun intended)though that this record will fly off the shelves into the hands of all the teenage and tweenage girls who worship Stefani's sense of style.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|It's not really Beatles as never heard before.<br />It is, however, a must have for Beatles fans and nice compilation for the rest.<br />I will keep it for \\"Strawberry Fields\\" alone.<br />But at the end of the day, it's just another way to make money on same old same old.. digitally remastered to sound better, but still..<br />Same songs, slightly different arrangements, slightly better sound.. but still the same songs we all know, nothing spectacular, nothing to knock you off your feet or out of your shoes.<br />And all the hype is doing this albume a disfavor.. cuz with great expectations come disappointments.
B000002V1D|5.0|I agree with the reviewer calling \\"Ordinary World\\" a dreamy, soaring ballad.  This entire CD is a class act and one of my favorites.  I never get tired of it!
B00005MKA3|5.0|This LP is probably tied in first place with my other favorite LP, \\"UPrising\\". My all time favorite Marley song is \\"Could You Be Loved\\" from the Uprising LP. It was the song that I first heard on the radio that made me turn to reggae as an alternative to disco/pop at the time. From there, I became a total reggae head.<br /><br />My love of roots reggae is still as strong today and this album is still at the top of my list, right under \\"Uprising\\". There isn't a bad song on it. I still have my original vinyl recording and play it from time to time.<br /><br />This is a must have recording for anyone who is getting into roots reggae. Its a true classic.
0446528056|4.0|This was one of my favorite Spark's books. Totally captivating and enjoyable. I was frustrated with Savannah most of the book, and I was not surprised with how it ended. Sparks did a good job of illustrating how being in the military and going off to fight for your country can definitely put a strain on any relationship. In my opinion, Savannah should have been a little bit more understanding and waited just those few extra months... if their love truly was that strong. <br /> <br />If you love Nicholas Sparks, I also recommend \\"The Time Keeper\\" by Kevin E. Cropp. It is another book you will not want to put down until you are finished.
1932100660|4.0|After years studying nutrition, I read with interest Colin Campbell's book.  I was disappointed to find his research only considered pasteurized dairy.  He states that dairy is bad for our health.  My question is \\"what dairy?\\"  If he is talking about the milk and cheese we find in the local grocery stores, I agree with him.  But what about raw goat's milk, or raw goat cheese? There is a world of difference.  For some people, raw cow's milk is also a healthy drink.  A lot depends on the person.  He does not take into account any of this.  I thrive on raw goat milk which I make into kefir or yogurt that I enjoy without sweetners.  Good research in this field was done years ago by Dr. Weston Price, a dentist who traveled the world over to understand the effect of nutrition on people of the world.  The healthiest people were the ones eating a natural diet, free of processed foods.  Dr. Price wrote a book entitled \\"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration\\" which I suggest people read as well as \\"The China Study.\\" I encourage people to see the movie \\"Forks Over Knives\\" giving a visual report of the studies done by Colin Campbell and others.
B000G759LW|5.0|Aguilera's album is simply amazing. She matured so much in the last few years, it's almost unbeliavable. I already liked her music very much in her \\"Dirrty\\" phase, but now she is even stronger. The lyrics are much softer and sweeter, although the album still has an edge. I like every single track in this album, except that I am a little tired of listening to \\"Hurt.\\" My personal faves: <br />*Back in the Day <br />*F.U.S.S <br />*I Got Trouble <br />*Here to Stay <br />*Mercy on Me <br />*Still Dirrty <br />Candyman <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this album!!!!
0790732203|4.0|A subversive, quintessential 1980s-style coming-of-age story, disguised as an 80s teen sex romp, set in the Chicago suburbs. It recasts the elements of William Faulkner's coming-of-age story, The Reivers--the young man (Joel), the old man's car (the Porsche), the corrupting influence (Curtis Armstrong), and Miss Reba's house (his parents' North Shore home), twisting them into a sort of Reagan-era fable where it's OK, even admirable, to be a pimp for a weekend. The moral: take responsibility for your own mess, get rid of the evidence, and exploit the corruptibility of your Princeton admissions rep.
0375805613|5.0|I adore Grover. <br />But when I saw this book in the bookstore I wasn't sure about it. <br />Didn't get really into it. Reading to my daughters is important and special but they love their pictures as well. And I just couldn't see on the pages what I would consider eye cathing moments. <br />But I read the reviews and gave it a try. <br />I LOVE it. YOu can \\" hear \\" Grover talk, while you are reading the story out loud. <br />It is really adorable. <br />It did bother my 3 year old one, at first, that I was reading the word Monster and Scary. She is at that stage right now where everything is scary and a Monster issue. <br />But because you are able to read this story with so much heart and in typical Grover excitable fashion, it is easy to turn the meaing of the words into something fun. <br />Each child is different. Mine was not thrilled with the ending.  <br />She was worried that Grover is THE monster. <br />Was he okay? She wanted to know. Is he still scared? <br />But now having read this book more then one time and showing my own excitment about it and telling her that it is a joke, a sweet story, it does put her at easte some. <br />Guess she will appreciate it when she is a bit older. <br />Till then I am excited to read  <br /> <br />Enjoy <br /> <br />
B000IJ79WU|2.0|SPOILERS: It could be that this film version was made from early cuts and totally unfinished, but two scenes really come out -- I prefer Lester's Eiffel Tower elevator scene that caused the release of the criminals, and the ending of this film is just lame. Though the kiss was a stretch in Lester's film, Donner's turning back time by turning the globe in reverse has no place on any film.
B000HEYVD6|2.0|Baldacci, rather than just tell a good story, has his characters repeat and repeat the left-wing reasons why the terrorists are justified in hating and attacking the United States.  Portions of this book must have been writen by George Soros or Alec Baldwin. <br />I have enjoyed Baldacci's past books, but this is my last Baldacci.
B000HEYVD6|4.0|I don't think this is his best work because he did get away from the plot and tended to get preachy. The book started off very slow for me but picked up about a fourth of the way through. He stretched some of the plot twists a little far, but for the most part it kept me entertained.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I loved this movie, it has a lot of emotional depth, and makes you care about the characters, i know there arent as much action sequences as you might expect but its fine, the movie as a whole is great to me, a good story and opens so much possibilities for the franchise, i just cant wait until they release a sequel, Bryan Singer promised it would unleash Wrath of Kahn on it, so im expectin something full of actions, and an alien villain.  <br /> <br />Brandon Routh makes a good superman in my opinion, people say hes not Christopher Reeves but what do you want, hes superman for the new generation. <br /> <br />Thank god superman is back, this movie, along with Batman Begins are the best superhero movies, and why not... among the best MOVIES of the last few years... and they are side by side on my dvd collection. <br /> <br />The DVD is good, i have read a few complaints about the picture quality but is good for me, the extras are great, specially Requien for Krypton, i loved the documental.... <br /> <br />Highly Recomendable
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The music, the setting, the MAGIC!  I was lucky enough to be at Slane Castle for the filming of this DVD.  It was truly a magical experience. As usual, all the girls were phenomenal!  The castle in the cool damp air, the lighting, the fire & smoke, the beautiful gowns, the angel voices - it was a fairy tale come true!  The DVD captures that magic and takes me back to Ireland. Thank you Lisa, Orla, Chloe, Mairead, Meav & Hayley for bringing such beauty to this world! David Downes is truly the musical genius of our time!
B000BNX3B4|5.0|This movie will appeal mainly to those over 30 years old who enjoy comedy/romance. The dialoge is witty and clever and includes many cultural references that younger audience members might not understand. Great movie. P.S.: The guy that trashed this movie loved War of the Worlds and gave it 5 starts. Don't believe everything you read!
0783231032|3.0|This is a fun movie with memorable bit actors like Slim Pickins and a great scene on board the Japanese sub that is quite funny.  Lots of take-offs from current events and other movies past and present at the time.  Lots of memoreable chareacters.  But the biggest problem I have with this version of the movie is the transfer.  This is without a doubt one of the worst video transfers I have ever seen.  The DVD looks and feels like it was done in someone's garage instead of in a valid studio.  If you like this movie as I do then please just get the VHS tape, trust me, the DVD is much worst than the VHS tape which I have both.  Good fun movie, lousey transfer method, I would swear that a bootlegger did the transfer.
1400043662|4.0|Despite what another official review on this page says, I was very bothered by the \\"loose threads\\" at the end of this novel.  Kafka is a great story, by turns realistic, fantastic, touching and gruesome.  Murakami puts out many ideas and concepts here, such as time, space, identity, life after death, and some Stephen King-like creepiness.  But by the time the reader reaches the end of this very imaginative work, everything ends up on a limp, flat note, as if Murakami did not know how to pull together all the various aspects of his story.  It's a wonderful book, but prepare for a possible letdown at the finish.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|I've been a fan of Michael Mann since the movie \\"Theif\\" with James Caan.  He makes it real, he makes it dark, as life usually is in the underworld and no one does crime like Mike and makes you root for the bad guy like he does.  You know these people are dirt but some of them are so personable that you want them to get away with it.  Michael Mann did another \\"Heat\\" featuring DeNiro & Pachino with \\"Miami vice\\".  The action was intense, the plot allthough fairly simple gives a look at the big business surrounding the drug trafficking trade.  The sophistication and the tools that the underworld employs is impressive and Michael shows us this in an easy to follow and understand way.  The characters play like Michael's original TV series \\"Miami Vice\\" sort of thick and detached but I don't have any idea what working on the inside of big time crime would be like and I guess most of us not involved in law enforcement would not have a clue.  Summation:  this is a fast paced action packed technical adept movie which fans of the TV show will enjoy.  Typical Michael Mann, but that's why we enjoy his movies.
1400079276|2.0|I cannot recall the last time when so little was demanded of me through out the course of a novel.  I have read a handful of Murakami's novel and for the most part they were thoroughly enjoyed.  And I must say that Kafka started off in very much the same vein- typiocal hooky Murakami enroute to an obvious existential awakening.  Beat the horse to death and then beat it some more just to make sure!  Turning a corner?  Where?  Into a supposed transcendence of the surreal and the metaphysical?  Does that make one an above average spinner of yarns?  This is Murakami once again presenting us with his typical portrayal of benign and inconsequential'characters'.  The only true character in the entire story being Nakata.  I kept thinking as I got into the second half of the novel, 'Is he really so blatantly obvious with everything, not leaving an ounce of subtlety for us to decipher and play with?'  He leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination!  He fails to create this 'dream-like' prose of of a story that I so often hear levied against this novel.  The only scene that gets to within grasping distance of such a realm of writing would be the 'Johnny Walker' scene that is referenced throughout several of these reviews.  Other than that, the rest is almost medicinally sterile, not to mention largely predictable.  I don't necessarily have an issue with that of the predictable when it is done well and has something worthwhile to say.  Murakami evolving?  More like Murakami stagnating into a bit of long-winded atrophy.  He merely placed a piece of parsley on the plate that is easily side-swiped into the garbage with the rest of the rubbish.  If you want to read Murakami, I kindly recommend Sputnik Sweetheart.  This is merely my impressions and tastes...to each his or her own.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I can't listen to any other music right now- I'm constantly listening to this album over and over.  Car, ipod, computer- it's always on, I'm obsessed with it.  To me, the recipe for this album calls for equal parts Smashing Pumpkins and Muse, heavy doses of Green Day and Queen, generously sprinkle some heavy metal and Broadway and voila- a FUN, highly enjoyable, addictive album.  Other bands can pack it up and go home.
B000E1155E|5.0|The title says it all.. When I was 19 I was doing things up, not caring about much and doing what I could to get laid.. Now look at these lads at 19 and you can see that for their age, this album rocks!!! They show vast maturity and song writing excellence that sometimes is lacking from some of our most eldest of pop stars.. They are no nonsense, lyrical, tempo driven, musicians who have a knack for making good songs that are well crafted and easy to listen to and like within one listen.. There is so much crap out there today that is so overdone (can someone please stick a fork in grunge wannabes please?) that its really refreshing to see a band come along that is unique with a unique sound and most important, voice.. Alex Turners voice is a welcome change from the Puddle of Mud and Kurt Cobain wanna-bes out there.. Even some of the would-be children of the 80's are sounding repetitive.. Give this album a whirl, and recognize it for what it is.. Its NEW Sounding Music that you can dig from the start.. Its not more of the same.. Dont Stay the Course like we did with the elections of 2004.. Take your taste to a new direction and it just might change your life... At least it will enhance it...

None of the examples are complete or clear enough to be of any use whatsoever. Its a lot of verbage with partial code snippets much like microsoft's (terrible) documentation. Don't waste your money.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Wanna read an excellent Horror book? Read F. Paul Wilson's The Keep (1981). Wanna see a classic example of how bad the movie version of a book can be? See Michael Mann's film adaptation of The Keep (1983).<br /><br />Wanna read an excellent Thriller? Read Thomas Harris' Red Dragon (1981). Wanna see an example of how a book can be made into a movie that's relatively true to the novel? See Michael Mann's film adaptation of Red Dragon called Manhunter (1986) [not to be confused with 2002's Red Dragon remake of Manhunter].<br /><br />Wanna see a campy, Michael Mann produced, popular TV series from the 80s? Rent seasons 1 & 2 of Miami Vice. Wanna see Michael Mann take the campy out of his TV series with a mediocre big screen adaptation? See 2006's Miami Vice.<br /><br />There really isn't much resemblance between Mann's 2006 feature film and the 80s TV series. In fact, I'm not sure why Mann even chose to stick with the TV series connection; I think that he could have re-titled the movie and characters with the same effect: an average buddy/cop movie. But indeed the characters are the same Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell in the film/Don Johnson in the series) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx in the film/Phillip Michael Thomas in the series).<br /><br />Perhaps the idea was that the Miami Vice name would draw more gate at the box office? If so, either someone was seriously mistaken based on a box office that was half of what it cost to make the film, or there just were never really that many Miami Vice TV series fans as was portrayed by its Neilson ratings from 1984 - 1990.<br /><br />The film was entertaining. A fairly involved story. Some good action. Acting was decent; exactly what you'd expect from Farrell and Foxx. Several silly movie mistakes in conjunction with a couple of guys that were supposed to be deep under cover. The movie was bit long; I don't how long the theatrical version was, but the director's cut I viewed was over 2 hours. I'm a big fan of directors' cuts when they add cool stuff; however, there are times when the theatrical versions are best left as is for the DVD release. Miami Vice was probably an example of the latter.<br /><br />So there you have it. A good buddy/cop movie that's not out of the ordinary. Not a collector's item, but a fair rental.they add cool stuff; however, there are times when the theatrical versions are best left as is for the DVD release.

B00005JPDP|5.0|Unwanted hatred offspring was born in a rubbish disposary and abandoned even before a first breath.<br /><br />Hatred and humiliated by all a growing man had been surrounded by, he developed an indefinite urge for tender and love on a very personal simply biological level not nurtured even with a shadow of community-bounded restrictions a middle-ages society imposed on then living.<br /><br />Short of education, his obsession and a craft only is making perfumes, based on his very natural superficial capabilities of memorizing the smells and imagine pure physical outcomes from the mixtures of chemicals. By a such extraordinary way he assumes people around and his rather investigatory-out-of-this-world imagination stipulates him pursuing females of whom necessary component extractions had been released.<br /><br />Knowing no boundaries in his unstoppable quest for these rather witchery activities, a young man not only converted his execution in a mass orgy but made himself an object of an indefinite sexual attraction, which act had ended his human existence.<br /><br />Although this movie might for instance be lined up with \\"Interview with Vampire\\", \\"The Queen of Damned \\" and, to some extend, \\"The Brothers Grimm\\", its deep philosophical meaning could hardly gratify a broad majority of cinema-goers.<br /><br />Personally, I would return to this brilliant work in some time later.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The West Wing is by far the best television series I've ever seen. 5 stars for that. However this set, although nice to look at, has too many flaws for me to recommend it very highly. 3 stars for this set.<br /><br />My main gripe is that there are no English subtitles. Why not? There is plenty of space on the disks and subtitles don't take up that much. The gain would be far greater than the cost!<br /><br />I often have to rewind episodes three or four times to catch a phrase that I can't quite make out hearing the first or second time. There is often so much background noise (sirens, crouds, music, etc) that one can't make out all the brilliant dialogue by only listening to the audio.<br /><br />The UK editions have English subtitles, so why can't the American versions?<br /><br />Another gripe is the packaging. While it is very nice to look at on the shelf, cleverly designed with file folders holding each season, it is impractical and scratches the disks! The folders are hard cardboard and the slits (not even lined with felt or soft material) are so narrow you have to really press the disks in, damaging and scratching them up!<br /><br />The UK boxed set uses 22 slimline DVD cases, holding two discs each, all packaged within season-by-season slip cases.<br /><br />If your DVD player can play European DVD's, I recommend paying a little extra and ordering the UK version instead: ASIN B000I8OC08 on Amazon.co.uk. It has the same 21+ hours of extras this set has so you won't be missing anything except the booklet and script, which frankly doesn't add much value.<br /><br />EDIT: As somebody kindly pointed out in the comments, seasons 1-5 have subtitles. Only seasons 6 & 7 are without English subs. Also, if you do consider buying the UK edition, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A REGION FREE DVD PLAYER, or that your player can play European DVD's. Read the comments to this review for tips on how to check your player. Thanks for voting and commenting! :)
B000JK8OYU|5.0|George Martin and his son have done a wonderful job of piecing together a songtrack that highlights the genius of the Lennon, McCartney and Martin.  George Martin wrote a special string accompaniment to the Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps which is worth listening to and collecting.  The mix of Lennon's Tomorrow Never Knows and Harrison's Within You, Without you is very exciting.  I feel this is a worthy compilation and a tribute to the creative genius of George Martin and all he did in making the Beatles as great as they were.
0743289412|2.0|I really gave this novel a chance... over 250 pages. Then, I had to put it down. I didn't like the main character nor the words King uses over and over. I just found it to be juvenile and disjointed. Not to mention uninteresting and poorly written-- as an English prof. in my spare time. Read old school King if you want to see better writing; this book is not on par with any of the better King books.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Enough of the generic hip hop stuff. And she keeps on dropping the \\"LAMB\\" stuff...I know it's her clothing line but this materialistic stuff is just disgusting now. And for a 30-something woman to behave this way is pathetic. I was a huge fan of hers, but this leaves me cold. Cool cover though.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie summed up every families frustrations when dealing with many different personalities.  There were so many moments I could identity with concerning my own family.  It is a definite MUST SEE!!  You will laugh & cry!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't know where I was when this came out on TV, but I never SAW it back in 2002!  I guess I was watching TGIF comedies on ABC (my mistake!).  I only discovered this series AFTER watching the SERENITY movie (also FIVE STAR entertainment!).   <br /> <br />So, to cut to the chase, I'll just throw my vote in with those reviewers who give this DVD box set FIVE STARS.  14 entertaining hours of action, adventure, humor and drama.  DVD extras are interesting and give some insight into the actors and directors thoughts on the show and characters.  QUALITY PACKAGING in FOUR slim line cases inside a slip-case box.  NOT the usual low grade, multi-set packaging which results in scratched discs!  Well worth the price of admission!

B000066C6F|1.0|This is a godawful movie, a waste of several million bucks by Universal and whoever else was responsible.  They could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the \\"sexy\\" health club craze of the 80s. Actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make.  Lucas or Spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so.
B000J10ER4|5.0|i think that everyone that is a fan of superman have to get this movie. it is a suprise at the end that will have to be another movie in the works.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|A well acted, well scripted, TOP NOTCH sci-fi adventure film--dare I say it--reminscient of the original 1977 version of STAR WARS!  In fact, I'll even go further out on the limb and say that the characters are more realistic, better developed and easier to relate to than Luke, Han and Leia!   <br /> <br />Chiwetel Ejiofor is EXCELLENT as the villian and the rest of the cast shine as well.  Great special effects!  Awesome, seamless music score almost on par with John Williams Star Wars score (but lacking that AWESOME main title theme!), as it ADDS and compliments the mood of the film.  You may think I'm being far fetched in daring to compare this to STAR WARS, but SERENITY is THAT good!   <br /> <br />The dry, wry humor is also great--just enough to ease the tension at just the right time!  Not marred by any goofy muppet \\"aliens\\", either.  Completely plausible story line.  A classic GOOD vs. EVIL story with a real world, not fairy tale, ending.  <br /> <br />DVD extras including interesting deleted scenes, humorous outtake/blooper reel, and enlightening commentary.   <br /> <br />I can only say, I HOPE THEY MAKE A SEQUEL!!!!! <br />
B000ION23K|5.0|Ant Bully is an animated adventure about a boy who bullies an ant hill, but has the tables turned on him when the ants shrink him down to their size. Rather than eating him, the ants decide to teach him a lesson by forcing him to live the way an ant does for a few days.<br /><br />During this shrunken period, the main character is forced to dodge deadly wasps and bullfrogs. He finds the ants greatest adversary to be the very exterminator he hired to fumigate them, as he begins to poison the ant hill with a cloud of nauxious gas.<br /><br />While resembling \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids!\\" quite a bit, Ant Bully puts a new twist on the whole \\"shrinking\\" thing, and I found it much more entertaining than any of the \\"Shrunk\\" movies. If your children enjoy animated movies of any sort, Ant Bully would be a great addition to their collection. Buy it today, you won't be sorry.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|It's always a risk when successful artists try to break away from their normal routine.  Gwen Stefani had no reason to venture out on her own.  She's a mega successful woman who was lead singer of one of the greatest bands in the world.  Lucky for her, she scored a huge hit with Love.Angel.Music.Baby, which was a very nice record.  It had variety and a fresh, invigorating new pop sound.  Following the \\"if it wins, it goes again\\" philosophy, here is The Sweet Escape.  And wow, I thought it wasn't possible, but this album is such a train wreck it's just shocking. <br /> <br />Gwen took the hugely successful \\"Hollaback Girl\\" and based her entire sophomore effort on it.  Unfortunately, \\"Hollaback Girl\\" was the kind of cute song whose formula only works once.  To try to replicate it so often on one record just sounds pathetic and desperate, which is a perfect description of this record.  The first single, \\"Wind It Up\\" sounds like it was written in like 5 minutes.  The production by The Neptunes is random and has no musical quality whatsoever.  \\"Orange County Girl\\" is utterly laughable!  What was Gwen thinking???  The same hip-hop-wannabe mess can be found in other tracks like \\"Now That You Got It\\", \\"Yummy\\" and the ghastly \\"Breakin' Up\\".  It just sounds like she's trying really hard to be something that she is just not.  She's proven herself with the No Doubt punk/ska sound, and she's especially great at the New Wave rock sound a la \\"It's My Life\\" with No Doubt or even \\"Serious\\" and \\"The Real Thing\\" from the LAMB album.  The rap/hip-hop thing just doesn't suit her, thus her talent is wasted. <br /> <br />On the upside, Gwen exudes brilliance in the song \\"Early Winter\\", which sticks out like a sore thumb on Sweet Escape only because it's so incredible that it doesn't belong on this mess of an album.  \\"Wonderful Life\\" and \\"U Started It\\" are also nice tracks on here.   <br /> <br />But with so many duds, this record is just not worth it.  I suggest you go on iTunes and download \\"Early Winter\\", and just forget the rest.  I've lost some respect for Gwen with this one.  Judging from the other reviews on here, I'd say I'm not alone.  I hope this is a wake up call to Gwen that she needs to stop trying to market herself to 13-year-olds and remember that she has plenty of fans that love her best when she's being herself.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I'm 28 so these movies mean alot to me.Great flicks for a great price.
B0007Q6PBK|3.0|To me, the 5 star ratings given to this DVD grossly overstate the quality of this production. While the music is great and Pavarotti and partners offer a magnificent performance, the video quality is terrible, the head and faces in the scenario wide takes are featureless spots while in the first planes the faces appear blurry and dark, spoiling the whole viewing experience.
B00005JPDJ|4.0|As a verteran lover of \\"chick flicks\\" I really did enjoy this movie.  Call me a sucker - a simple and predictable story line for certain - but I really did enjoy watching the chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.  The two of them are adorable together!  I also enjoyed Kate Winslet and her supporting characters as sort of a secondary story.  While I hate to say anything negative, I'm not certain I personally would have cast Jack Black.  I'm not saying it was the worst of casting choices, it's just that I could think of a dozen other guys who probably would have played the role much better.      Overall, women all across the country will LOVE this movie!  It's just what I imagined it would be, everything I expected it would be and EXACTLY what I wanted to see.  A lot of romance, a handful of giggles and a dash of sadness.  Loaded with eye candy, the sets and scenery are to die for! And Jude and Cameron have NEVER looked better!      But now to the real \\"star of the show\\" - the boom microphone!  The first couple of times I noticed it I thought to myself huh.... that's odd - how did they miss that?  When it continued appearing I started to giggle with each cameo.  Pretty soon the entire audience was rolling with laughter as not only the microphone but the entire boom arm began appearing in scene after scene!  Bobbing up and down just above their heads - I actually kept expecting it to bonk one of the characters in the head at any given moment!  Someone in the audience made the comment that it reminded them of a giant dildoe (sorry about the profanity - I don't even know how to spell it!) It was a strangely accurate description the way it inappropriately and comically kept sneaking in and out of the scenes. There was one scene where they were walking across the room and the entire mic - and about 8 foot of boom arm walked and bobbed along with them - before you know it I was certain we were going to see the guy holding the arm!  I thought for sure we had just gotten a \\"bad\\" copy of the flick - some pre-edited version that our tiny little town had accidentally been shipped for viewing.  Most of the time it added comedy to the scene and I actually enjoyed the laughter of it all, but there were a couple of serious scenes toward the end of the movie when it was distracting and even annoying.  With today's technology I honestly don't know how it managed to hit theatre's that way - it easily could have (and should have!) been edited out.      Don't let that keep you from seeing the movie though, it really is sweet and heartwarming if you are in the mood for a simple feel good girl movie.  If you liked \\"My Best Friends Wedding\\" or \\"The Wedding Date\\" this is probably right up your alley.
0743289412|2.0|Like many others, I've read all of Mr. Kings books and will continue to do so but, I sure wish I'd of gotten this one at a discount instead of paying full price.  This book is just plain uninteresting.  The Stand and most of his other stories leave the reader in awe at the way Mr. King can turn a phrase and/or weave a tale but this one feels like the \\"Anti-King\\" must of taken over! The wordplay is childish and the plot is....well what plot?   Sorry Mr. King, as a fellow Mainer I promise to keep the faith though!
6305736650|3.0|I held out for a very long time before watching this film for the first time. With all the hype that comes with this film, as well as many other \\"classic\\" films, such as \\"Citizen Kane\\", I was expecting a big let down. I'm from the younger generation, and a lot of these old movies made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, just don't appeal to me most of the time. But I must say that this film wasn't that bad. The plot stayed interesting and the ending had a good twist as well. However, I don't think that this movie should be recognized as being one of the best films of all-time.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|There is not a thing in this DVD that I would like to see changed. The magnificent performance, vocal and visual of the artists, great real life scenarios and impeccable photography deliver the ultimate viewing experience. Bravo!!!
B000JJS8TM|4.0|First let's get this out of the way--\\"Love\\" is the soundtrack to a show and that's the reason it exists. The bottom line here is that the remixes even if they differ very little from the final versions will make many of these songs feel fresh again to Beatles fans that have heard them a million times. Heck it might even convince someone raised on Nirvana or listening to Cat Power to give them a try.<br /><br />The 5.1 DVD/CD is the way to go. The various mixes on the 5.1 version are terrific highlight elements that were only hinted at in the CD version and even the original catalog. The best mash versions of the songs on here are truly inspired George and Giles Martin combine the rhythm track from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" with George's \\"Within You Without You\\" to truly stunning effect. Occasionally some of them do sound a bit like \\"Stars On 45\\" but the bulk of them sound wonderful.<br /><br />The same can be said for \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" and even \\"Come Together/Dear Prudence\\". \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" features Harrison's acoustic demo (which appeared unadnorned on the 3rd \\"Anthology\\") with new orchestration by the Martins. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" features the progression from John's demo, to the first two versions the band cut to stunning effect as well. All of these are highlights of this album. All of these certainly deserve four or five stars.<br /><br />Equally as good are the new remasters of classic Beatles recordings including the first completely true (**purists note I said TRUE not the half stereo/half mono mix on \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\") stereo mix of \\"I Am The Walrus\\". While all the tracks sound stunning in either their new stereo masters/remixes or 5.1 remixs there isn't anything new here that a Beatles fan doesn't already own. It sounds a heck of a lot better than the CDs currently on the market for the band (with the exception of \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" and \\"1\\")but it's still the same classic songs. That's not a bad thing it's just that their whole catalog has been due for an upgrade for some time now.<br /><br /> Nevertheless Beatles fans will enjoy hearing the familiar strains of classic Beatles songs some altered a lot while others are altered a little. Like the \\"Songtrack\\" release this isn't anything new but will be enjoyed by Beatles fans but can't replace the band's classic back catalog which sorely in need of being upgraded.bad thing it's just that their whole catalog has been due for an upgrade for some time now.  <br /> <br /> <br /> Nevertheless Beatles fans will enjoy hearing the familiar strains of classic Beatles songs some altered a lot while others are altered a little.

0060922583|5.0|Michael Talbot, with this clearly-written book, provides a framework for understanding many anomalous events, including spontaneous healings, remote viewings, ghosts, near-death experiences, and even UFOs. The answer lies in the nature of the universe. We live in a world that feels \\"solid\\" to us, that we believe to be \\"real.\\" But to many ancient sacred traditions, the physical world is but an illusion. The Hindus call it \\"maya\\" and believe all matter emanates from another world that exists beyond our senses. What if this is true?<br /><br />The problem with accepting this concept has been the impossibility of proving it. Until now. Talbot shows how several theories, notably those of neurophysiologist Karl Pribram and physicist David Bohm, postulate a universe that is less solid than we like to think. In fact, it presents us with a universe that is basically a hologram, a projection from somewhere else. The implications of this are many. One property of a hologram is that the whole picture is contained in each portion of the whole. The whole is not the sum of the parts, but rather the parts are pictures of the whole.<br /><br />Everything in the universe is holographic, including our bodies. We perceive the world with our physical senses but we are actually capable of sensing with any part of our body. Hypnotized people are able to see through objects and, in situations of sudden duress, people have developed 360 degree vision and superhuman strength. Accupuncturists have found that the ear is a map to the rest of the body and they can affect organs by putting the pins in the correct place in the ear. Other such maps have been found in other parts of the body, such as the hands and feet.<br /><br />Talbot shows how the holographic model explains things like physical manifestations of objects and bilocation, as described by Indian yogis. A modern yogi, Sai Baba, is able to manifest plates of food out of nowhere. One of my favorite books, Autobiography of a Yogi, contains stories of a yogi who could be in two places at once (bilocation) and physical manifestations. In the US, remote viewers have been able to penetrate military installations on the other side of the world, seeing the images of those places in their head. How are these things done?<br /><br />Talbot discusses the experiences of another of my favorite authors, Robert Monroe, who, before he died, wrote extensively about his out-of-body journeys.  Monroe found his consciousness could easily separate from his physical body and he traveled in the astral realm, finding it a world built from thought. He also found he could suddenly be bombarded with a quantity of information about something he was seeing; he called these information pcakets \\"thought balls\\" and Talbott, himself a phychic, corroborates this experience.<br /><br />The Holographic Universe covers a lot of territory and tries to unify many esoteric and anomolous experiences in support of the holographic idea. Bohm's concept of an implicate and an explicate order mirrors the spiritual tradition that says the spirit world is the \\"real\\" world which creates the physical world. It provides a deeper understanding than just accepting the particle/wave dichotomy we get from physics, which has no real explanation of how something can be both matter and energy and why an observer affects what he is observing. Experiments in physics have provided us with a lot of bizarre behavior by tiny particles - the stuff that makes up our universe. Can ancient spiritual traditions explain this behavior and give us a new model of reality?

1582701709|4.0|I liked the DVD much better than the book. The DVD was totally positive, but like Ms. Boyer, I found some of the books comments made my energy take a dive. Here is why:<br /><br />Ms. Byrne says that those of us who suffer weather disasters have created the disaster or adversity.  Like the power of certain prayers, some things happen because of energies that have been invested far longer than the span of one life. When you move into a disaster prone area you encounter \\"risk energy\\" that may have existed for hundreds of years. If Ms Byrne thinks she is stronger than this energy and can stop future storms from entering New Orleans, let me be the first to invite her to live here....Keeping one author in a swank French Quarter apartment (untouched by flood waters) has to be cheaper than the millions we are spending to rebuild the levee system. Even though I don't agree with Ms Byrne I would sooner trust her to protect the city than the government engineers who sat clueless for two weeks while my apartment slowly dissolved under 11 feet of water.<br /><br />I also share Ms Boyer's dislike of Ms. Byrne's comments about turning your back on \\"fat\\" people (or anyone else).  The book assumes that everyone who wants to can access good feelings at a moments notice and encourages you to shun people who don't fit your physical or emotional ideal. For many people, especially those from emotionally or financially impoverished backgrounds, feelings of abundance and self-worth can be impossible to access. A few years ago I encountered a book by the social psychologist William Swann. His studies on the affect that self-esteem has on what you attract into your life make very interesting reading that is closely related to the topics discussed here. While forgetting the past is not that hard, creating a feeling that you didn't have while growing up is nearly impossible for most people.  Yes, we do hear of rags to riches stories, but they almost always involve a pivotal personal encounter.<br /><br />Perhaps there is a reason that this information has been kept a secret for so long. Maybe that reason is that too many people would have used the knowledge to abandon the sick, dying, and less fortunate and spend their time generating new toys and bigger and bigger houses. Religion has often existed to remind people that they should be grateful for not having adversity. If you can wish it away, why bother with those who can't? This whole scenario reminds me of the creation story told by the psychic, Edgar Cayce, many decades ago. He said that man was an angel who created matter as a plaything and became encased in it because he forgot his divinity. I see no spiritual problem with having it all, but that can and should include kindness and compassion toward everyone.nter.   <br /> <br />Perhaps there is a reason that this information has been kept a secret for so long.

B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" is a timeless masterpiece. It is, perhaps arguably so, THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER RELEASED. King's perfect piano pieces are deceptively simple-sounding because she makes it seem so easy. And the result is a catchy, hook-laden set complete with simple, plain-but-true lyrics which lift the spirit and leave the listener feeling rejuvinated because of their timeless messages of love, peace, understanding and compassion. It is not really necessary here to discuss the album track-by-track: most everyone knows these songs (\\"I Feel The Earth Move\\", \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"So Far Away\\", \\"You've Got A Friend\\", etc.) - they are like old friends, beckoning us to listen once more. It's no wonder this album is one of the biggest selling ever. If you don't own it, I highly recommend purchasing yourself a copy; if you have owned it previously, you know you need to update to CD! This magical album will elevate your personal musical landscape to new levels of appreciation. It is an absolute must-have. Treat yourself. You will be so glad you did!
0590652362|1.0|Never heard of this book before about 10 years ago. It was never on my bookshelf as a child (I'm 32) or any of my older siblings. Got it as a gift, and simply don't see what the fuss is about. There are more engaging bedtime books (Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book, and Sandra Boynton's Pajama Time! and The Going to Bed Book among them). Or, look around the room and make up your own, e.g. Goodnight walls/floors, windows/doors, smoke detector, etc. There--just saved you the cost of this book. <br /> <br />Ultimately, it probably doesn't matter *what* you read/sing to your kids to wind them down, but *how* you read/sing it to them. Slower, repetitive, deep, more drawn out you-are-getting-sleeeeeepy delivery, etc. Not rocket science. This book fits that pattern, but coupled with the bizarre coloring of the illustrations, mismatched repetition, and hard to read in dim light printing, it's just not worthy of the hype, IMO.
B000GFLE86|4.0|The eagerly awaited follow-up album to the enigmatic singer's phenomenally successful \\"Careless Love\\" may not be as beguiling, but it has charms of its own - not least the upbeat, laughter-filled opener, \\"I'm All Right\\" (an original composition), Serge Gainsbourg's \\"La Javanaise\\" and Leonard Cohen's sensual \\"Blue Alert\\".   There is a stronger country vibe and, if anything, the lackadaisical Billie Holiday drawl is even more in evidence than in the first CD.   And if ever a song suited the persona of the singer, it's \\"Everybody's Talkin\\".   When beauty is understated...
B0007M22TI|2.0|My Mother was talking this show up so big, she made me come over and watch it. I didn't have the heart to tell it was a total sham. She went on and on about how great their voices were. Well, no doubt. It was blaringly obvious to me from the first few seconds. <br /> <br />Though I've never been a professional musician/singer, I've performed in an amateur capacity for decades.  I can almost always spot lip sync-ers. I'm always shocked that others can't tell. Here, the Celtic folks aren't even very good at it either.  I didn't catch the violin piece that was mentioned here on a different review, but it wouldn't shock me to learn that was faked, too.  I begged off and played with my nephew after a token viewing. <br /> <br />I certainly think this sort of stuff is fine for people like my Mother.  She's always been easily entertained (and easily fooled).  No way I'd enjoy this sort of entertainment.  There's far too many gifted LIVE performers out there. <br /> <br />EXAMPLE:  I remember seeing Anne Murray a few years back (Clearwater, FL) Her voice wasn't quite what it used to be, but that did not stop her from singing live in front of thousands.  I respected her all the more for the effort and the courage, and I enjoyed her show very much.  I didn't hear a single complaint after the show (in the lounge or outside).
B000I0QK74|4.0|This Christmas album is distinctively James Taylor from the first song to the last. It is a sound, a voice, a performance that is so familiar. Apparently there is more than one version of this album out there, but the same can be said for Frank Sinatra (Come Fly With Me) and other recording artists' albums as well.  But to the point, if you like James Taylor and Christmas you can still listen to James during this holiday and still be in the spirit. And I like that cover!
B00005JPC7|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own \\"Truman Show\\"-like bid at legitimacy with \\"Stranger Than Fiction,\\" a high concept comedy/drama, written by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Foster, about a man who discovers that he's actually a fictional character in an author's yet unfinished novel.<br /><br />Harold Crick is a straight-arrow, stuffed-shirt IRS agent who lives a life of highly regimented solitude completely cut off from any real social interaction with the people around him.  One day he begins hearing the voice of an unidentified woman portentously intoning the details of each of his actions as he goes about the business of living out his daily life.  As it turns out, the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel, a neurotic, reclusive novelist who is suffering from severe writer's block as she attempts to complete her latest work of literary fiction.  Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh-and-blood human being, Eiffel plots ways to kill him off in the final scene.  When Harold finally figures out what is happening to him, he seeks advice from a local English professor (Dustin Hoffman) who comes to believe Harold's bizarre predicament and tries to help him avoid his preordained fate before it's too late.<br /><br />Highly reminiscent of such reality-bending movies as \\"Groundhog Day,\\" \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Adaptation\\" and \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" among others, \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes - of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art - are so retrograde and shopworn at this late date that the movie comes across as far less cutting-edge and innovative than its post-modernist premise would lead one to expect.  There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it.  In short, \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" feels more like an outline for a movie than a fully worked-out film in its own right.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is worth seeing for the low-keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page.  The resplendent Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the tax-cheating ultra-liberal storeowner whom Harold is sent to audit and who opens his eyes to the possibility of true love for the first time in his \\"life.\\"  Their scenes together are genuinely well-played, touching and romantic.  With her stiff-upper-lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation.  Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.<br /><br />There's a great deal of poignancy in the final act as Eiffel has to decide between literally killing off her creation to preserve her work or letting her creation live even if that means spoiling a potential literary masterpiece.  It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God - or at least the demi-god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|If you can, suspend your disbelief for a few hours and enjoy this soft sweet dreamy romance.  For those who are looking for a romantic comedy please do not watch this movie, although there are some funny parts it really isn't a laugh out loud sort of movie.  Instead it is like a long cool sip on a hot day.<br /><br />In the Lake House you meet Kate, a dr., who is moving from her interesting and beautiful home on the lake.  She leaves a short note addressed to the next tenant asking him or her to forward her mail.  Enter Alex (Keanu Reeves) he is moving into an interesting and beautiful not recently inhabited lake house.  He finds a strange note and writes Kate back asking maybe she is mistaken.  After a series of notes back and forth Kate and Alex realize they are writing from two different time periods.<br /><br />Through out the movie Kate and Alex share their lives with each other through a series of letters.  The movie does a great job of making the letters seem like conversations going back and forth.  The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves is unbeatable.<br /><br />Although I really enjoyed the movie and will watch it again I am disappointed by the DVD.  There are a few outtakes but no other extras.  If you are looking for a lot of outtakes commentary etc you will not find that on this DVD.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a surprising Christmas album from Sarah McLachlan. The innovative arrangements and innovative use of instruments and sounds creates a rather euphoric feeling in the best spirit of the season for the listener. These devices truly augment and enrich Sarah McLachlan's wonderful voice which reciprocates beautifully with these arrangements creating a warm and elated experience. This is one of the most remarkable Christmas albums to come along in years that is true to the spirit of the Christmas season.
0393327655|5.0|pg. 13 \\"...criticizing a person's faith is currently taboo in every corner of our culture.  On this subject, liberals and conservatives have reached a rare consensus:  religious beliefs are simply beyond the scope of rational discourse.  Crticizing a person's ideas about God and the afterlife is thought to be impolitic in a way that criticizing his deas about physics or history is not.\\"  This notion obviously annoys Sam Harris and his book is all about challenging the idea that questioning someone's religious beliefs is perfectly acceptable and actually is very important.  The consequences of the beliefs held by organized religions are a matter of life and death, so not challenging why someone believes something is dangerous.<br /><br />He spends a couple chapters (Reason in Exile and Nature of Belief) talking about what belief is and why it is so powerful in influencing our behavior.  For example, if you believe your immortal soul and happiness in the afterlife is contingent on acting a certain way due to your religious beliefs, you may be more likely to act in a way that would be contrary to common sense (suicide bombing, holding snakes, chanting in tounges, etc).  I guess this is all obvious stuff, but Harris writes clearly and logically so that your instincts about religion and faith are reinforced (at least if you share my instincts).<br /><br />Harris has a dry wit and sometimes I found myself laughing out aloud.  Here's a gem:  \\"Jesus Christ -- who, as it turns out, was born of a virgin, cheated death, and rose bodily into the heavens - can now be eaten in teh form of a cracker.  A few Latin words spoken over your favorite Burgundy, and you can drink his blood as well.\\"<br /><br />There is a entitled 'The Problem With Islam' that explains how Islam is the most problematic religion in the modern era due to a few primary factors.  One, Christianity and Judaism have effectively secularized and ignored some of the violent parts of their religious texts.  There is still potential for horrible things to be done in the name of Christianity and Judaism, however, in reality these religions have largely pacified.  Islam on the other hand has still not evolved to that extent.  Additionally, the Koran has a significant amount of violent and dangerous precepts.  The most commonly known principle is the concept of jihad, which is often translated as 'struggle,' 'striving,' or 'holy war.'  This principle is the motivating factor behind many of the atrocities being committed now.  Harris spends a good 15 pages of quoting the Koran to reinforce that this is not just a few subtle or perhaps mistranslated lines in the Koran that encourage violent behavior towards non-believers.  He admits at the end of the chapter that quoting all of these passages is \\"desperately tedious,\\" however, he points out that it is necessary because there is no arguing with what the text actually says.  I agree.<br /><br />After the chapter on Islam, he goes back to the West with a chapter called \\"west of eden.\\"  One of the ideas that I found particularly disturbing is that perhaps the United States' unswavering support of Israel is motivated by Christians beliefs formed from the book of revelations, which propehises the return of the Messiah once the Jewish state consolidates power in the middle east.  How twisted is that!  Also, he spends time in this chapter talkign about how the west wastes time and resources legislating morality and punishing victimless crimes, simply because these crimes are considered sins in the bible (examples are sodomy/homosexuality and drug use).  He also hits on the ban of research on stem cells as incredibly foolish (I agree wholeheartedly).<br /><br />The last two chapters of the book get more esoteric and philosophical.  He explores the basis for answering ethical questions, ranging from morality and happiness to intuition to self-interest to love.  This chapter was a bit frustrating for me because I didn't find any certain answers here. Harris basically concludes that their is a link between ethics and postive human emotion (people to be happy and to be in love).  I don't dispute that, but you can certainly find gaps in this as well because different people may have different ideas of positive human emotion.<br /><br />The last chapter gets a bit weird and is called Experiments in Consciousness.  This is Harris acknowledging that humans have a desire to understand where they come from and who they are and that spirituality is something we crave.  He explores how understanding our consciousness may be the way to satisfy this itch.  Some of this chapter frankly went over my head and I want to re-read, but it was interesting.  To wrap this up, I sincerely enjoyed the book and it more than re-inforced many of my haphazardly formed beliefs.  I think the current organized religions are dangerous and inevitably lead to conflict.  Maybe I'm a skeptic because there are non-religious people i know who think that religion is a necessary evil to provide meaning to the larger populations' somewhat meaningless lives.  Perhaps there is some truth to that, but wouldn't it be an interesting experiment to see how we can bring about happiness and peace without religion?  So far religion hasn't done such a great job.that their is a link between ethics and postive human emotion (people to be happy and to be in love).

0684833395|3.0|\\"The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one.  The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.\\" G. K Chesterton.<br /><br />*<br /><br />This book's one flaw is that it neglects a discussion of the concentration camps.  But more on that later. . . .<br /><br />Catch-22 is classic absurdist literature, focusing on bureaucrat's circular reasoning and double-binds.  Although the story set in WWII Italy, anyone who has had to deal with hierarchy and bureaucracy--be it the military, college, the DMV, or the Board of Deacons--will resonates with the ideas expressed herein.<br /><br />It is the American equivalent of \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" In style, Heller is a mixture of Douglas Adams and Dave Berry.  He has the same with and the same dead-eye for human foibles, and the cumulative effect of compound incompetence.  This is not a \\"Greatest Generation\\"-type book.<br /><br />I found the first third of the book fresh, with the mixture of absurdist and repetitive humor, the stream of thought, and mid-sentence scene changes.  Heller's style gives the book not so much a dreamlike feel, but more of a surrealistic flow to the events.  It reminds me of the old classic \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\\"<br /><br />However, the second third of the book was tedious. The novel humor deteriorated into a gimmick, and a series of stream-of-thought gags.  The repetitive humor therefore became redundant.  I got the point that things were weird, but the humor-mechanism was overused.<br /><br />The last third got interesting as Heller stopped focusing on absurdist gags, and began focusing on the narrative.  This book has a large cast of charters, and it is a fitting tribute to Heller that he keeps track of the mob, and is able to keep us interested in their lives and in the situations.<br /><br />What surprised me the second-most was that this book is definitely a seed-source for M*A*S*H.  The most famous moments such as Hawkeye streaking, or his mental breakdown all have their roots in this book.  What is that quote about flattery?<br /><br />What surprised me the most was the hidden religious aspect. The book's opening lines are: \\"It was love at first sight.  The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.\\"  The chaplain serves as a pontiff, the unit's bridge between man and God. And Yossarian's relationship with the pontiff is one of love.<br /><br />Brilliantly, Heller drops the subject and goes on with the narrative.  However the religious ideas keep cropping up.  Chapter 18 has a discussion of God by two atheists.  I think the statement by Lt. Scheisskopf's Wife on page 180 is a classic example of someone trying to have their cake and eat it, too.  Chapter 25 is devoted to the Chaplain's doubts--which leased me to wonder why Heller wants the character to be this way.  Then there is the ironically titled of Chapter 39, \\"The Eternal City.\\"  So religion is clearly a leitmotif, but it also serves as book-ends to the story.<br /><br />The story (and Heller's sequel), focuses on Yossarian's and Milo's relationship.  Yossarian is the rebel and outsider--even outlaw--of the system, while Milo's assimilates and takes advantage of the system.  But as the incident with Snowden and the missing morphine illustrates, the assimilation backfires.<br /><br />So it is the death of a comrade, the unnecessary death due to the war profiteering system, that forces Yossarian to have a change of heart, and reject the sub-word of the black market.  This is the essential Christian message of the Atonement.<br /><br />This incident forces Yossarian to shift loyalties from Milo and the conniving Generals to the Chaplain. This is an odd realignment, considering that in Chapter 36, the Chaplain Christically suffers for Yossarian horseplay in signing the letters \\"Washington Irving.\\"<br /><br />Once again, we have these Christic moments is this grim and gritty tale of the Other Side of the Greatest Generation.  This reminds me of what ex-atheist C. S. Lewis observed, \\"A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere--`Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and stratagems.' God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.\\" (Surprised by Joy).<br /><br />This brings us to the concentration camps.  The book's conflict is Yossarian vs. the absurd situation, with the enemy being the omnipresent Catch-22.  But Heller does not discuss the nature of Nazism, except for the brief banter in Chapter 42.  This omission is the key--the danger of bureaucratism is infinitely smaller compared to the dangers of Nazism. Or Islamofascisms for that matter.e these Christic moments is this grim and gritty tale of the Other Side of the Greatest Generation.  This reminds me of what ex-atheist C. S.

0307341542|4.0|When men fight, according to first novelist Gillian Flynn, they tend to bludgeon one another in blunt contests of strength, like good-natured warriors facing off in an athletic contest.  Women fight in a much nastier fashion, she asserts, clawing, biting and using whatever other sharp objects are available to achieve domination over their female rivals.  If you're willing to buy into Flynn's scathing portrayal of the so-called gentler sex, you'll surely be sucked into this dark mystery/thriller.<br /><br />Camille Preaker, a reporter for an obscure Chicago newspaper, is assigned to investigate the recent murders of two young girls in her claustrophobic Missouri hometown.  Besides overcoming the natural wariness the townsfolk exhibit toward a nosy journalist, Camille must face down her dysfunctional family - a controlling mother, distant step-father and a disturbed, thirteen-year-old step-sister whose catty group of friends makes the \\"Mean Girls\\" crowd look like a troup of Brownies.  The closer Camille gets to cracking this grisly mystery, the harder she struggles to keep her horde of inner demons at bay and the more she begins to fear for her own safety.<br /><br />If judged purely by the intensity of its suspense and page-turning quotient, \\"Sharp Objects\\" would easily merit five stars.  Flynn taps into the psychological horror generated by a twisted family in a way that electrifies the narrative, reminding me of Dean Koontz in that regard.  I had trouble, though, accepting the unlikely logistics behind the crimes and found certain characters to be so over-the-top as to strain credibility.  These quibbles aside, Gillian Flynn already has mastered a fast-paced and hard-boiled writing style that's perfectly suited for the suspense genre, and she has created a fascinating heroine who could form the centerpiece for a winning series.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\"

Everything is scremed full throttle from this poor young girl. The two most offensive crimes she commits are in the beginning of family as she sings..\\"what about what I want..\\" Holliday barely whispered these opening lines and you felt the characters pain...Hudson screams these lines like some angry nasty girl...you feel nothing for her.Second crime is I am Changing...after listening to it I was changing my mind about buying this CD. Full throttle from the beginning no where to go but a repulsive flat than sharp riffed up ending..it was truly grotesque. Oh, and Eddie Murphy is lousy too. I love this music and they spoiled it for me.

Then her journey into a nervous breakdown begins. It is an interesting look into what was most likely Plath's battle with mental illness. I recommend the book. It is a quick, easy read and not nearly as dark as some others seem to describe it as being.

0393327345|5.0|Fight Club is an awesome novel that stretches the mind and its imagination. This action-packed novel makes one think twice about society and who serves your meals. Fight Club is somewhat inspirational and uplifting. It shows how materialistic people are not free people, and that it is only when you lose everything that you are free to do anything.  I highly suggest this novel for anyone willing to have a open mind and an extreme attitude.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|It pains me to write this review because I love Gwen Stefani.  I've enjoyed all her work with No Doubt.  I loved Love-Angel-Music-Baby.  While I respect Stefani for trying something new, I was sorely disappointed to find very few melodies on this record; you'll find they are replaced by lots of over produced hip-hop beats.  Also I've always appreciated Stefani as a lyricist because of the sincerity in her words.  Over the years, I've taken a lot of comfort in what she wrote.  With insipid lyrics like the following (for example from the track Yummy), it's very hard to take her seriously, let alone appreciate what she's saying:   <br /> <br />I'm feeling Yummy head to toe (you see me) <br />Ain't got no patience so let's go (you see me) <br />Look, I'm diet drama <br />Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas <br />Man there's so much heat beneath these clothes (you see me) <br />I know you've been waiting but I've been off making babies <br />& like a chef making donuts & pastries <br />It's time to make you sweat <br />Sex & sugar is the flavour <br />Ovens & beaters & graters <br />Beats made of bongos & shakers <br />It's time to make you sweat   <br /> <br />Overall if you've enjoyed her work with No Doubt and her first solo album, you probably won't care for this one.  And if you don't believe me, professional critics are not praising this album.  It's garnering very few positive reviews from professional music critics--New York Times and USA today, for example.  (Her first album received very favorable press.)  You should only purchase this album if you are a hard-core Gwen fan.   <br /> <br />
B00008V5VN|5.0|I have a strong feeling that the dudes who made this record were getting stoned one day listening to \\"Sweet Leaf\\" by Black Sabbath and one of them said to the group, \\"Dudes, what if this song was slowed down... so slow that it was an hour long?  What would that sound like man?\\"  And then they all agreed it would be pretty heavy for that to happen, then they sat in silence pondering this discovery... got even more stoned, picked up their guitars and recorded this album.   <br /> <br />All that said, I have never smoked weed in my life and I think this record rules.  Recomended to stoners, metal fans, or anybody really.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I wasn't expecting all the negative reviews of Gwen's new album. I think it's lightyears ahead of the other pop on the radio these days. Yeah, we'd all like to see her back with No Doubt, but it has been interesting to see her on her own. Her work doesn't stray too far away from No Doubt's exploration into the new wave/electronic sound on 2001's Rock Steady, and she still maintains just enough weirdness for most of her stuff to bypass the hip hop community, with the exception of \\"Hollaback Girl\\", \\"Rich Girl\\", and the latest \\"Wind it Up\\", although I don't see it winning over a lot of that circuit with her sampling from 'The sound of Music'. It seems as though Fergie is inspired too. Just check \\"London Bridges\\" and \\"Fergilicious\\", both blatant, but successful stabs at \\"Hollaback Girl\\" hype. Gwen's answer back? A dull candy factory-ode to Fergie in \\"Yummy\\". Boring. But like LAMB, an album that wasn't as self-conscious, the latest, Sweet Escape, isn't all perfect. I never particularly liked \\"Cool\\", \\"Rich Girl\\", \\"Harajuku Girls\\" ,and \\"A Long Way To Go\\" in the same respect that I don't like \\"Yummy\\", \\"Orange County Girl\\", \\"Don't Get it Twisted\\", and \\"U Started It\\". Gwen's foray into hip hop has had mixed results and while it can be refreshing for someone to try it on, you keep wondering about their roots. Should she try to win over new fans that don't even remember or even know No Doubt's work? On the other hand, Gwen has always had a presence and can adopt and shed images and styles a' la Madonna. Basically, the formula isn't always going to work. What does work is Gwen as weird, new wave songstress. I don't mind \\"Wind it Up\\" because it's different. Different isn't another cheer-anthem, but different definitely is found in the \\"Lonely Goatherd\\". The title track is blissfully aware of Gwen's `cutesy pop savvy, often displayed in No Doubt's recent work. She wants to be a good girl, and she compares herself to sour milk, blaming a ruined relationship over an open fridge door. I dare anyone to find a better pop song about keeping your groceries (and your love!) fresh. Like LAMB, the ballads are a nice balance to Gwen's jumpy/electro-street sound. \\"Early Winter\\" would more than likely be chosen as a single over \\"4 in the Morning\\", but personally I think \\"4\\" is a better choice. I've heard people scoff over \\"Breakin Up\\", but I could see it being on a No Doubt outtake album or something. It's pop grit with a new wave sheen and hip hop overtones that would never be noticed by radio. And I love that about it. One of my absolute favorites is \\"Wonderful Life\\", and few can argue that it's Gwen at her best. If Gwen had emerged in the 80's she would have been in the same class as Blondie, Berlin, The Cars, and The Cure. But it's 2006 and times have changed. Hip Hop rules the mainstream and stars are left searching for the best beats, or they just call Timbaland or The Neptunes. Even, Nelly Furtado has beefed up her folky image, and it worked, making \\"Promiscuous\\" one of the year's biggest hits. I don't always like what Gwen does, but she has crafted some great pop songs in the past few years, alone and with No Doubt. Instead of being criticizes , she should be celebrated for taking the risks she does. No Doubt was still very popular when she took a break from them, and she chose hip hop pop tart over ska/ alterna-chick. I say, as long as she maintains her quirkiness and love of polished new wave, I don't think we have anything to worry about. It's a great pop album.
B000IFS0HM|5.0|An outstanding memoir about the hardships of a young Irish boy and his impoverished family. McCourt relives his life in Ireland in an honest, many times humorous and shameless way. His pace throughout is impeccable.
B000AGTPUK|1.0|This movie is one of the worst of all time and will remain so for eternity.  It has absolutely no spirit, or soul, of any kind.  From characters to digital effects, it's a totally *cold* movie, period.  Watching it was very painful from the very start, a chilly experience.
B0007TKNII|5.0|When I picked this movie up, I expected it to be like the broadway play.  It was almost as good.  Though you don't get the full experience of music and movement as if you went to see it live, this was a wonderful adaptation to watch when you're in the mood.  It's also much cheaper than paying for the tickets!<br /><br />The movie was luxurious in color and detail, the cast did a fairly well job of singing and acting.  The whole movie was like watching a dream and was hypnotic at times such as \\"The Music of the Night.\\"  Though not a perfect movie, this was an enjoyable one to watch.  There seemed to be symbolism portrayed as well in the mirrors, the masks people wear and the rose in bloom.<br /><br />I only wish that Michael Crawford could have played the Phantom.  The one who they cast in this movie didn't seem as smooth or as polished in singing.  But in the end, he garnered enough sympathy that I wished Christine could have stayed with him as well.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I was so excited in 2004 that the James Taylor Christmas CD was being released, I went to the Hallmark store and asked them to sell it to me before their promotion started.  They said they hadn't unpacked it yet--but I was very annoying and they had little choice but to go unpack the box and sell me a few! I gave some for Xmas gifts and kept 1 for myself. <br /> <br />Anyway, it is such a great CD, it was worth it to make a fool of myself! <br />I have loved James Taylor's music and that sweet voice of his for as long as I can remember.  This CD is really worth having in your collection.  Great song choices and I think it has something for everyone.  I am going to buy this new one as well becuase I want the extra songs-- and a freind borrowed my CD last year for her holiday party and I can't seem to get it back!!
B00005JPGM|5.0|this movie deserves 5 stars, even the ending sucks big time. the whole story is very intense and thrilling, it kept the audience sitting tight in their seats, not too many people left for the restrooms in the middle. decaprio did a great performance from a soldier of fortune to a born-again humanist who sacrificed himself for nothing. i am very glad that he finally looked pretty mature and indeed with genuine star quality. he should do more like this character instead of playing the image of a playboy. great performance of the other supporting actors too. the stunt, the fighting and massacre scenes were done great. only the editing needs to be more generous in cutting, not much but definitely needed.

Fake science being perpetuated by a self-promoting, grant-funded industry (no crisis equals no fundings.)

We bought another one for our second daughter, who also loved it and read it and read it.

B000A6T1KE|4.0|I missed \\"Nemesis\\" when it hit theaters a few years back.  I was never a huge \\"Star Trek\\" fan, but I always enjoyed watching the films.  I especially enjoyed the original casts' flicks.  TNG, although good, just wasn't the same as the original cast.  With that said, I expected \\"Nemesis\\" to be a flounder due to the negative lashing it received not only from movie critics, but Trek fans as well.  I can see where loyal fans of the series could be upset with this film.  First of all, it has a heavy leaning towards action.  I always felt that TNG was quicker to try peace talks instead of phasers to solve a problem.  Secondly, fan favorites such as Riker, Worf, and Geordi were given the second-tier treatment in order for the focus to be placed firmly on Picard.  Even Data, though he has a crucial role in this film, doesn't get to really shine until the movie is about halfway to completion.<br /><br />The story, in my opinion, was wonderful.  **SPOILERS** A Romulan project gone bad, Shinzon (Tom Hardy), overthrows the Romulan Senate and almost single-handedly destroys the Federation by utilizing the warrior race Remens.  He also plays with the Remens' emotions by using the prejudices of the Romulans toward them as a weapon.  Not to mention the fact that this guy is a clone of Picard.  That alone makes for wonderful mind games between the pair.  Shinzon uses Picards mind and heart against him, trapping him with B-4, a prototype of Data, and then playing to his heart by telling him about the cruelties he suffered as a Romulan slave.  I actually felt a little sorry for Shinzon even though I knew he was the big baddie from the beginning.<br /><br />This movie plays well to a general sci-fi audience.  Hardcore TNG fans will definitely find a lot wrong with this film.  When all is said and done, however, we get a nice space action yarn that will appeal to most people in the long run.<br /><br />The DVD is very nice.  It comes with a plethora of special features, broken down into movie, Federation, and Romulan sections.  It's a nice edition to any sci-fi fan's DVD library and a necessity to any \\"Star Trek\\" completionist.n into movie, Federation, and Romulan sections.

0790731002|5.0|In a franchise, when there is a change of director or lead actor, there usually is a division of opinion.  I've noticed some think the Batman movies were better with Tim Burton directing and Michael Keaton playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.  While I preferred Keaton to Val Kilmer, this movie was 1) close enough to the original to fit in the series, and 2) was more likeable to me with Schumacher's approach.<br /><br />One thing that interested me in this movie were the villains.  Two Face never made it to the TV series I grew up with, but he was my favorite comic book villain.  The Riddler did not have much time in the comics that I saw, but I loved Frank Gorshin's Riddler from the TV series.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face took me by surprise.  My impression of the comic character was more of a somber, sinister, intellectual man who was disfigured (and the animated Batman of the early '90's fit that image).  Jones portrayal was as over the top as Jack Nicholson's Joker.  I wasn't expecting it, but I liked it.<br /><br />As far as the Riddler:  my first impressions of Jim Carrey were negative (not based on seeing \\"In Living Color\\" or any of his previous movies, which I never watched), and thus I was disappointed to see he got the role.  Watching the movie, though, made me a fan of Carrey's.  Yes, I still like Gorshin's better, but this is close.<br /><br />There was only one thing I did not like about Kilmer's performance as Bruce Wayne, and that was his hair color (it did not matter after he put Batman's cowl on).  Kidman was great as the love interest.  Chris O'Donnell did an excellent job as Robin.  Drew Barrymore did okay in her small role.  Hinkle and Gough returned for round three, and fared as well as they did previously.<br /><br />As far as comparing the story with the comic book/TV series:  The series did not deal with the origins of Batman and Robin.  In the movie, Dick Grayson's family died as heroes, trying to save the lives of the circus audience from Two Face's bomb.  In the comics, I don't recall the same heroism in the deaths of the Graysons.<br /><br />The first two movies clearly avoided any allusion to the TV series.  Not so with this one . . . there is a hilarious scene that makes fun of the TV Robin.<br /><br />This was my favorite of the three, and I would recommend it.

B00005RDCM|1.0|Let's begin with the album cover, it's no secret that despite it shows Ace Frehley he was not in the band anymore at the time of release of \\"Killers\\" nor didn't he play on any of the 4 new songs, who date from before \\"The Elder\\"-album (on which he also hardly played the leadguitar). Well, the 4 not so new but never before released songs are worthful to buy this album, not for the other part, 8 (or 10 on the Japanese version) regular songs, taken from a string of album without any cohesion. Some are even from albums released in a short time before \\"Killers\\" and any Kiss fan would owe them already. Therefore they don't add anything to your collection. \\"I was made for loving you\\" stems from \\"Dynasty\\" and is the regular album and singleversion, nothing more. It puzzles me why they didnt incorporate the far superior extended maxisingle version with an even more outstanding guitarsolo in the middle. As far as I know this is not available on CD, not even on the 5 CD Kiss boxset. That would have been a great extra, in stead of alreay owed and wellknown songs. Therefore 3 stars for the 4 newies alone, the rest is just a compilation like so many others.
B000059XXZ|4.0|Since I was a child, I was a Batman fan.  No wonder:  I was seven when the TV series premiered.  The series was ridiculous (I remember a scene where Batman and Robin were catapulted to their supposed death, and Batman remotely controlled the Batmobile to save them.  That I could handle, but when the remotely controlled car stopped until children got out of the way . . .).  Adam West's Batman did little to terrify the villains, as the goal of the comic book Batman was.  But I still was hooked.<br /><br />Tim Burton's Batman fit the comic book character better.  Here was a Batman you wouldn't really want to mess with.  The vigilante side of Batman was more obvious, especially since he was working outside of the police's cooperation in this movie (no red phone to the Batcave here).  In addition to the vengeful side, though, this Batman was a detective like the comic book version.  In the movie, he was able to analyze the Joker's plan to poison others and put an end to it.<br /><br />I did not like all of the changes.  In one episode, the TV Batman said decency was everyone's business (actually, the same episode before he and Robin were catapulted by the Penguin).  In this movie, Bruce Wayne is sleeping with the love interest outside of wedlock.  In the TV series, Batman's goal was always to take the bad guy alive (I think the Catwoman was the only villain who did not always survive, but that didn't keep her from coming back).  In the movie, Batman considered a villain better dead than on the loose.<br /><br />Burton had worked with Michael Keaton before in \\"Beetlejuice\\", where the actor gave a comedic tour-de-force.  Burton must have seen something in Keaton.  This role was much more low key, but Keaton pulled it off.  Jack Nicholson's Joker was much more menacing than Cesar Romero's (which is more true to the original comic book Joker), but definitely a performance to remember.  Pat Hinkle's Commissioner Gordon is easily forgettable, but Michael Gough's Alfred was an excellent and realistic portrayal of the man who served as both a servant and father figure to Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The rest of the acting, including that of Kim Bassinger, Robert Wuhl, and Jack Palance, was adequate.<br /><br />As far as the scripting, this movie did not have much of the fist-cuff action the series did until the end.  It was more psychological (and actually realistic) than the series was.  Additionally, the movie introduced a symbiotic relationship between Batman and the Joker, each being responsible for the other.  And maybe I better stop before I give too much away (I know, too late).<br /><br />This movie, along with \\"Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade\\", helped me realize that Roger Ebert is a critic that reflects my opinions.  He disagreed with the late Gene Siskel in recommending these two, liking \\"Indiana Jones\\" and giving a thumbs down on Batman.  After watching both movies, I agreed with Ebert on both accounts.  While I think this movie was very well made, directed, and acted (not to mention the Oscar winning art direction), I found it disturbing, and thus would not fully recommend it.as an excellent and realistic portrayal of the man who served as both a servant and father figure to Bruce Wayne/Batman.

B000ANNSJ2|2.0|I have to disagree with the earlier reviewer because his point of view is incorrect. Any of the \\"Killers\\" albums, whether on vinyl or on CD, US/ European or Japanese, share the same 4 new songs. According to the CD-inlay of \\"The Elder\\" album they were recorded before that album but not appropiate enough to gain a place on that one so in that way they are outtakes in a sense, leftovers some might say, how good they sound. Only 2 of them made it on the 5-CD Kiss boxset. The Japanese version of \\"Killers\\" has compared to the US and European versions 2 more songs (\\"Shandi\\" from \\"Unmasked\\" album and \\"Escape from the Island\\" from \\"The Elder\\" album) but they are 'normal' and don't add anything extra, if you owe those albums already, like every Kiss fan will do. Those aforementioned songs are indeed great bonusses for which this album alone is worth its price, albeit sometimes a high one. For the rest this is simple a compilation, from which Kiss has (too) many on offer. Therefore 3 stars, for the four new songs only. {Ace is sorely missed).
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Burton's first \\"Batman\\" movie was more psychological than action.  This sequel answers with more action.  One thing it did well was give three unique opponents for Batman to deal with:  Max Schreck (Christopher Walken), Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Selina Kyle/The Catwoman (Michelle Pfieffer).<br /><br />Note I used the word \\"opponent\\", instead of \\"villain\\".  Corrupt businessman Shreck and the murderous, perverse Penguin definitely fit the bill of being villains, but the Catwoman is more of an anti-heroine.  True, there is some collaboration with the Penguin, but for the most part, the Catwoman more resembles Batman than the foul feathered fiend.<br /><br />Being a fan of the TV series, I cannot help but compare the TV and the movie versions (I'm not as familiar with the comic book versions of these two).  In the TV series, the Catwoman is clearly a villainess, as opposed to the movie counterpart.  Regarding the Penguin, both the TV and movie versions ran for mayor.  However, the TV Penguin came off more aristocratish and a ladies' man, which the movie version never came close to.  Walken, one of my favorite actors, is excellent as Shreck.  Pat Hinkle and Michael Gough return as Commissioner Gordon and Alfred respectively, with Hinkle being as easily forgettable and Gough being very effective.  Michael Keaton is even stronger in his role than in the previous movie.<br /><br />When this movie came out, some people called it a family film because of the action in it.  I shake my head at that.  To me, any PG-13 movie is not a family movie, and this clearly earned the \\"13\\".<br /><br />As far as being psychological and thought provoking, the first movie was far superior.  As far as being an action packed movie, this one is preferrable.  Allow me to close this review with a comment that was made be either Keaton or DeVito:  If you put Tim Burton in one room and any other director in another room, no one would make the film that Burton would make.ke.
B000J103X4|3.0|While most rappers seem to love having feuds with each other, they usually don't want to have them with people under their own label. But that's exactly what happened with The Game. After his debut album The Documentary was released, tension mounted between him and the group he was apart of, G-Unit, and more specifically, its leader 50 Cent. The back and forth bickering led to The Game leaving the group, and taking stabs at them whenever he could. Dr. Dre, who worked with all the men involved, was supposed to help produce The Game's second album. However, while he never chose either side, he backed out of The Game's album after all the drama ensued. Despite that, The Game kept the original Dre inspired title for his sophomore album, Doctor's Advocate.<br /><br />Despite Dr. Dre's absence from the album, he certainly lives on in spirit. Not only does the album's title reference Dre, but his name is mentioned on nearly every single track on the album. For anyone not familiar with the back story behind it (and even for some people that are), this might become really annoying, really quickly. When he's not name dropping, The Game's ego is on full display, as most of the tracks he spends his time boasting about his talents, his money, and his women. Basically, just the typical far of most rap albums nowadays. Fortunately, the beats are very good almost all the way through, which means the constant boasting go down much easier. Some highlights on the album are Let's Ride, Too Much (featuring Nate Dogg), and Wouldn't Get Far (featuring Kanye West). The most interesting track on the album is the title track, which features Busta Rhyme. The track is basically an open letter confessional to Dr. Dre, apologizing to him for not taking his advice, and thanking him for being like a father to him. Busta also speaks to Dre, telling him that he's trying to help The Game by giving him advice as well. It's the only track that The Game really deviates from the usual fare, and seems to let his guard down and really let his true feelings show.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty good album. If you were a fan of his debut, you should really enjoy his album quite a bit. Despite the constant mentioning of Dr. Dre, and the constant boasting, there are quite a few infectious beats on the album that will keep you rocking your head for awhile.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5to let his guard down and really let his true feelings show.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a pretty good album.

B000IOM1RI|4.0|Tenacious D is the collaboration between Kyle Glass and actor Jack Black. Billing themselves as \\"The Greatest Band on Earth\\", their music is filled with lots of humor, such as them singing a tribute to the greatest song in the world, because they forgot how the greatest song went after defeating the Devil with it. They've grown a very loyal audience with their music, even though they've only released one album so far (their self-titled debut in 2001). The Pick of Destiny is their second studio release, and the soundtrack to their movie of the same name.<br /><br />This album is quite different from their debut album, since the scopes of the albums are quite different. Their first album was just two guys jamming trying to establish themselves, while this album is a soundtrack, and is much bigger and more cinematic. Unfortunately, the album is set up a like a narrative, and (as it happens with a lot of soundtracks) doesn't really work well when it's not accompanied by the movie. A lot of the songs sound as if they were designed strictly for certain points in the movie, and don't carry as much weight if you haven't seen it and aren't aware of what the songs are referring to. Despite that, there are still some very good songs on here, such as a revival of their theme song History, as well as other tracks like Papagenu (He's My Sassafrass) and Kickapoo.<br /><br />Overall, this album still has a lot of the intensity and energy that has made Tenacious D so popular. But, unfortunately, this album doesn't work as a stand-alone album as well as their debut unless it's accompanied by the movie. It's a good soundtrack, but might disappoint diehard D fans who were hoping for an album closer to their first one. Watch the great movie though, and it'll be the CD you're listening to all Christmas!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|The review by Joyce Carol Oates of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel (\\"he will win your admiration, and he will break your heart\\"), is equally fitting for the movie version of Everything is Illuminated. I happened to catch the movie at the Nashville Jewish Film Festival and was able to convince my boyfriend (who usually does not enjoy reading or my quirky taste in entertainment) to come along with me. We were both laughing out loud through a large portion of the movie but also found ourselves thoroughly impressed with the sweeping landscape views (it's worth watching this movie just to see the sunflowers at Augustine's house) and the tasteful seriousness of history being portrayed. At a surprise to me, he enjoyed the story so much that he decided our future dog should be named Sammy Davis Junior Junior. Even though neither of us is Jewish, this movie made us both reflect- on the oft-untold pieces of history, family, and memories. Rarely do I enjoy a movie as much as its book counterpart, but this was a great addition to the story I fell in love with and a commendable interpretation of Safran Foer's unique and brilliant writing style. <br /> <br />Interesting Cameo Tidbit: The book author is briefly in the movie, playing the leafblower in the Cemetery at the beginning. <br /> <br />Preview note: If you want to watch this movie with younger children, I would preview it first, due to the nature of some of the scenes, especially towards the end of the movie.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen Stefani made her name as the lead singer of No Doubt. And, in the tradition of numerous lead singers, she decided to branch out and become a solo artist. Her debut album, 2004's Love.Angel.Music.Baby. accomplished the job of making her a bigger star solo than as part of a band, due largely in part to the hit single Hollaback Girl. After taking some time off due to pregnancy, she returns with her next album, The Sweet Escape.<br /><br />Her second album is very similar in style to her debut. She more or less just expands on the sounds of her first album. This also means that this album is uneven in quality, just like her debut. There are times when she doesn't sound fully comfortable with her transition from a punk princess in No Doubt to a club diva. When it works, her music is very good, such as on the title track and U Started It, and 4 in the Morning. But there are moments like Orange County Girl and Wind it Up where she seems to be forcing her new attitude, and stumbles, especially when she tries to rap. She definitely sounds more comfortable when the songs have a new wave-ish sound to them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent album, which will probably be liked by anyone who enjoyed her debut. This album is uneven, but when it works, it's a very good listen. Hopefully on her next album she'll stick to the sounds she seems most comfortable with, which will definitely make her next release much more consistent.
0553213105|4.0|I liked this book, because it describes a situation that isn't weird. It could really have happened. I was surprised that I liked this book, because classic books are mainly boring, because of the fact that things happen very slowly. In Pride and Prejudice things didn't happened quickly but the book kept your attention.<br /><br />Melissa Nuis
B000JK8OYU|4.0|The Beatles. You would be hard pressed to find a superlative in existence that hasn't been used to describe them. They are widely considered to be the greatest band in music history. Their career and music has taken on a mythological aura that only seems to grow with each passing year. Their stature in music history is one of the reasons why people still use their music even today. The latest use of The Beatles music is Love, an album that will probably scare diehard Beatle fans when they hear what it is: a remix album mixing up different versions of different songs to create a new track. The project is helmed by Giles Martin, the son of legendary Beatles producer George Martin. The album was created specifically for a show in Las Vegas by show troupe Cirque du Soleil, a project that cost well over 100 million dollars.<br /><br />For those Beatles fans holding your breath about how bad the tracks came out, there's no need to worry. This isn't an experimental album in the vein of The Grey Album (which melded The Beatles White Album with Jay-Z's Black Album). This album is designed to reach a mass audience, without alienating the core Beatle fans. Because of this, the tracks don't differ that much from the originals. There are a few differences, but nothing that winds up being particularly radical. Of course, this is The Beatles, so it's not like their music needs much help anyway. The songs are still good, but really nothing that you haven't heard before. The only track that really feels like a mix of different songs combines sections of Drive My Car, The Word, What You're Doing, and Savoy Truffle. It turns out to be a great track, and really hints at what an experimental album using The Beatles' music could be like.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The second season of Veronica Mars continued to delight the family. It is now the reason for several generations to come together and religiously, see and enjoy each and every episode. Kristen Bell has matured and her performance is superb. The learning that takes place thanks to these shows, is simply something no one who has teenagers at home should by-pass. For example, the sequence offered while Veronica Mars attends Jury Duty provided the insight necessary to teach Katya, Nadya, Monica and Michele about civic duty and the awesome responsibility we have as citizens of the United States. Would highly recommend owning both seasons if you want to foster an open environment. Thanks to Veronica Mars our communications lines are... best in class!    The first season of Veronica Mars simply delighted the family. It captured the attention of several generations that now gather, religiously, to see and enjoy each and every episode. Thanks to this show, we traveled to Texas with our cousins, Monica and Michele Del Rosario, to meet the star of the show, Kristen Bell. We were fortunate enough to also meet several cast members, also attending this event. One of the highlights of the trip was encountering Kristen Bell during an elevator ride, for we were staying at the same hotel. Of course, we have the photo to prove our amazing luck! Veronica Mars has brought adventure to our lives, but better yet, it has opened the channels of communications between family members, Monica, Michele, Katya, Nadya, Alex and I, who now have in common an appreciation for this sleuth of a show! Would highly recommend any family to acquire the series!!! If you have teenagers in your home, it is an amazing way to stay in touch, learning lots about new technologies, gadgets, and what is possible, thanks to the Internet!!!
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I listened to all the songs and I have to say they are all pretty good.  A few are so so, but I like to listen to this CD when working out on my treadmill.  Of course the BEST song on this CD though is Wind it up! =)
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|Christmas reminds me of this book, because I read it 2 years ago during the Christmas shopping season and I carried it from store to store;literally did not want to put it down.To this day, the story stays with me. I was initially afraid to read this book, knowing the subject matter. I was afraid of how I would feel. Instead, I felt somehow uplifted. I loved the characters and the empathy the author derived. I gave this book to many as a gift, because it touched my heart. There is no synopsis I can make.I could see the whole family,as if I too, were \\"watching\\" from heaven. Alice Sebold captured something very special in this book;I highly recommend it. Be not afraid.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Jason Reitman may have gotten into movies via nepotism (his dad is Ivan Retiman of \\"Ghostbusters\\" fame), but with \\"Thank You for Smoking,\\" he proves that he belongs in the game.  This is one of the smartest, funniest satires in years. <br /> <br />Two things make the movie work.  The first is Reitman's restraint.  This is a movie about smoking, and yet we don't get any of the obvious scenes of people miserably puffing away on cigarettes, slowly killing themselves for our amusement.  Instead, nobody really smokes in the movie - the best humor in this situation, lies in America's hypocrisy about smoking rather than the act of smoking itself. <br /> <br />\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" examines the ludicrous truth that one of America's most profitable industries essentially kills 1,200 people a day.  And why does it do so?  For several reasons, but mainly because Americans are sheep willing to be sheared, so long as we are told what we want to hear. <br /> <br />Enter Nick Naylor, played perfectly by Aaron Eckhart (\\"In the Company of Men,\\" \\"Erin Brockavich\\").  Naylor is head spokesman for the tobacco industry, and he was born to do it.  The self-proclaimed Michael Jordan of spin can go onto a TV talk show, face an audience of sanctimonious nitwits who want nothing more than to boo the evil tobacco industry, and walk off the stage having received the handshake of a teenaged lung cancer victim and also having created the impression that the tobacco industry cares more about its customers' lives than the public interest groups who merely want a martyr. <br /> <br />Naylor is riding high, and becomes the heir apparent to the Colonel (Robert Duvall), Mr. Big in Big Tobacco.  Naylor goes to Hollywood to negotiate with Mr. Hollywood (Rob Lowe) about getting cigarettes back into movies.  Naylor does this while lunching with fellow MOD Squad (\\"Merchant of Death\\") members, lobbyists representing alcohol and firearms, and trying to educate his son about what is great about America.  Ourgreatness boils down to two things, Naylor tells his son - our endless appeals system, and the fact that if you can argue correctly, you are never wrong. <br /> <br />Eckhart nails this role (pardon the pun).  What makes this a great performance is that Eckhart does not play Naylor as a true believer, either in tobacco or the morality of the game he plays.  He is just very, very good at his job, and he's got a mortgage.  \\"99% of what goes on in the world, for good or evil, is motivated by the fact that people have to pay the mortgage.\\"   <br /> <br />Naylor's life takes a sudden turn south as he is (a) threatened with murder (and there is something about the threat that makes it realistic) and (b) starts sleeping with a probing journalist (Katie Holmes), when he should know better than nothing will be 'off the record.'  But these two scenarios merely create a higher wire for our acrobatic hero to negotiate, and he does so with style and panache. <br /> <br />\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" may make you shift uncomfortably in your seat a few times, but it will make you laugh a heck of a lot more.  And, rarest of all for movies these days, it will make you think.  What a great movie.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|For all those whining about Josh's seeming departure from his style: you really ought to listen to the CD more closely. Josh's song selection really displays the versatile quality of his voice (the octave transitions are as smooth as they come) & the fact that he wrote a decent amount of the songs exhibits his natural genius.<br /><br />I enjoy the majority of the songs being in English--it makes them so much more sing-along-able. It is hard to nail down any highlights to the cd, because all the songs are so much fun to listen to.<br /><br />Those of you who did not purchase the CD/DVD combo really are missing out on a considerable amount of insight to Josh's thoughts on the cd, as well as some laughs; my family & I sat on the couch & giggled at Josh's antics.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is most certainly Josh's best & most mature album; you'll be enjoying it for years to come.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This is my first cd of his, and I really love it!  Every song is a treasure.  Josh definitely has a new fan :)
B000AARKOO|4.0|This movie was a lot better than Alexander and just about as good as Gladiator (Rome seems to be more sexy than tales of the middle-east).  During the time of the crusades where Christian hordes from France decided to kill all non-Christians in the middle-east because \\"they were told by g-d,\\" Orlando Bloom flees after he has murdered a priest.  He ends up in the desert and running out of water and happens on an oasis and a horse.  Two Arabs challenge him for the horse which they state is theirs.  Bloom kills one and lets the other one live because he needs him to show him how to get to Jerusalem.  It will turn out later that the man that he spares is the son of the Arab king and each man will continue to do favors for the other throughout the movie. <br /> <br />Bloom ends up in Jerusalem and catches the eye of the \\"married\\" sister of the local king.  She eventually starts to sneak off to see him.   Her brother the king, does not have long to live because he has leprosy and the woman's husband will become the new king through her when she dies. <br /> <br />The rest of the movie involves clashes of egos between the new king, Bloom, the Church leader and everyone else and it appears that egos totally blind men even if it will cause their death. <br /> <br />There are some excellent battle/siege at the castle scenes as good as Troy, Arthur, Lord of the Rings and all the other movies of that genre. <br /> <br />Bloom makes and excellent hero and he seems to make the impossible happen.  I really liked this movie.
0875428940|4.0|This is my second deck and I really like it!  The colours are more muted, but the combinations work well with the imagery.  Very easy to read.
0684800713|5.0|I've a broad background when it comes to books, as a youth I mostly read Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey and other fantasy.  Later I started reading science fiction, William Gibson, David Wingrove, Neal Stephenson.  I also read physics books, philosophy, sports.   <br /> <br />However, I have read very few \\"classics\\" in my lifetime.  It's high time to rectify that, so I'm going to read all of Hemingway and many other classics over the next few years... wherever my path leads me. <br /> <br />This is the first Hemingway novel that I have read - or at least remember reading.  I'm sure I read Old Man at some point during high school, but I have no recollection of it.  I also wrote a biography report on Hemingway at some point during my high school years, but admit I don't remember anything much about that either.  I have been to Key West, visited his home and pub.. so I feel that despite not being familiar with his work that I have some connection to the man. <br /> <br />When I first started the book - I was shocked by the writing style.  I remember thinking - \\"wow, I could write this\\".  It really sounded like it was written by an amateur.  How could this man be considered one of the greats of writing?  I never had to look anything up in the dictionary, most sentences were incredibly short, and everything seemed .. well... simple. <br /> <br />After my first reading, I thought the book was good, but not surprisingly so.  The characters were interesting, but not particularly deep.  I must be missing something.  I must be out of my league here, even though the book didn't seem all that hard. <br /> <br />I also felt like it wasn't \\"right\\" for me to be reading Hemingway.  I have no education or background in literature... I haven't studied the history of that time period.  I have no great desire to become a Hemingway expert... some feelings of, \\"Well, I'd feel really strange discussing Hemingway with 'normal' people in American society.\\"  This was somewhat confirmed by my Motherwho said.. \\"Wow.. Hemingway... DEEP!  I could never read that.\\" <br /> <br />So, I read it again about a year later.  Then again about six months after that.  After the third reading, the writing style seemed to disappear into the background, and it became almost soothing.  I began to see more of the characters through the clarity of the writing, and they became much more real to me.  The depth of the plot and symbolism started to come through, even though I'm not particularly searching for such things. <br /> <br />As I write this, I almost feel like I'm at the very beginning of understanding him.  Almost like if you program in Lisp for awhile, you stop seeing the parentheses. <br /> <br />I think this book is now one that I'm going to pick up many more times in my lifetime because of the familiarity of it, and the feelings of \\"home\\" it brings to me.  I don't know if that's what Hemingway intended, but I feel pretty close to Jake and the rest of the characters. <br /> <br />I suppose what I want others to get out of this review, is that if you're afraid to read Hemingway because it's going to be too hard, you're way off.  There is something for everyone here.  You might even find it *too* easy at the first reading and go back for more.. just like I did.  I think as I go through Hemingway, it'll be like peeling away layers of an onion.  Even if I never peel away more than one or two layers, it's still worth it. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone... really, it's readable by anyone.  You don't need an education in literature or to be particularly \\"sophisticated\\".  It's an easy read, so if you don't like it.. not much wasted, but I really think you won't regret it, especially if you go back for a second or third helping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743289412|5.0|Author Scott Landon died two years ago and his widow Lisey is starting to go through the papers he left behind. Going through his stuff is a painful process as Lisey finds many items that bring back memories of her relationship with Scott. But Lisey is about to experience real physical pain when a crazed fan of Scott demands some of his work. Despite calling the police, Lisey realizes the fan will kill her if she doesn't stop him. However, Lisey will learn that she's not alone; Scott's love for her was so great that he is able to help her one more time.<br /><br />If \\"Cell\\" could be considered to mark the return of Stephen King the master horror writer, \\"Lisey's Story\\" is the return of Stephen King the master storyteller. Lisey is a strong heroine, still dealing with Scott's death as well as the mental health issues of her sister Amanda. Even though Scott is dead as the book opens, Stephen King makes him seem alive. Scott's story is revealed slowly throughout the book and is heartbreaking, especially his childhood. Jim Dooley is a true mad man and Stephen King is at his scariest not when writing about the supernatural but when Dooley attacks Lisey in an all too realistic way.<br /><br />Long-time Stephen King fans will notice that he, as he often does in his books, mentions characters from some of his other novels, such as Michael Noonan, Norris Ridgewick and Andy Clutterbuck and will be delighted to visit Castle Rock again. Boo'ya Moon, where Scott went to hide from his demons (and he had plenty, including his father) is new to the Stephen King world, but elements of Boo'ya Moon will remind readers of other worlds of Stephen King and will also remind them of \\"thinnies\\". And, speaking of Boo'ya Moon, \\"Lisey's Story\\" has the most beautiful cover I've ever seen on a book.<br /><br />\\"Lisey's Story\\" is one of Stephen King's best books.
B00005JO9J|4.0|I agree with other posters who said that the show was very predictable and full of cliches. But sometimes, that's not a bad thing. If you sit in front of the TV to be entertained without thinking too much, this show is perfect. It deals with life in compact little episodes.
B000AGTPUU|1.0|That's what my seven-year-old daughter thought of the movie after we suffered through it. A terrible, terrible film that can't decide whether it wants to be dark or humorous.  Tedious dialogue and cliched visual effects.  How many times can they use the roller coaster ride cliche?  Trust me, you will get a lot more out of watching Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer again.  Pass on this one.

006085880X|5.0|The Pact is an incredible story which makes anyone cry and ask many questions on what's going on in a teenager's head. Why do young people act the way they do and most importantly, why we the parents aren't aware of what they're trying to tell us with their actions. This book is with no doubt one of the greatest books of Jody, an amazing writer to whom I admire for being able to touch us with the points she makes with each one of her books! <br />
B00005JPGM|5.0|\\"Blood Diamond\\" is a film that exposes harsh truths, in effect forcing the audience to get a taste of someone else's unpleasant reality. Specifically, it focuses on the buying and selling of blood diamonds, which are mined in war zones and secretly sold in order to finance an insurgent's war efforts. A majority of the story takes place in Sierra Leone, a small African country that actually directed the world's attention to blood diamonds in the late 1990s. The country was immersed in an intense civil war at that time, fueled by a militant band of rebels called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF for short) and their attempts to overthrow the government. Funding their efforts was an illegal diamond trade, one that forced many innocent people into becoming workers.    This movie doesn't attempt to hide the brutality of that civil war; likewise, it doesn't spend long periods of time focusing on bloodshed. What it does is effectively tell a compelling human story that's just as touching as it is ugly. Taking place in 1999, the main character of the story is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Sierra Leone native put to work in a diamond mine after the RUF destroys his village and forcefully separates him from his family. While digging up part of the riverbed, he finds a sizeable diamond chunk that has a slight pink tinge to it, something so rare and valuable that its sale could prolong the chaos. Solomon quickly decides to hide the diamond, burying it in a patch of land near the river.    When the government's legitimate military force raids the area, Solomon is arrested on suspicion of being part of the RUF. In jail, he crosses paths with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a slick diamond smuggler with no regard for anyone's well being other than his own. He witnesses a shouting match between Solomon and an RUF soldier nicknamed Captain Poison (David Harwood), one that directly addresses the missing pink diamond. This peaks Archer's interest; he's looking for a way to finally leave Africa, a continent full of hatred, corruption, and despair, more so than even he can stand. He arranges for Solomon to be freed so that they may join forces, find the diamond, and save Solomon's family. Unfortunately, it's a dishonest union; Archer is merely using Solomon as a way to obtain the diamond. He has no feelings whatsoever for a refugee family.    At least, he initially doesn't. As the film progresses, some of Archer's layers peel away, gradually revealing a moral compass that isn't as off course as one might think. We come to see him as someone who's been hurt a few too many times, preventing him from pursuing an honest life. American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is trying to reach that side of Archer in order to expose the atrocities occurring within Sierra Leone. In her own way, she's just as manipulative as Archer; she can't write about the corrupt diamond industry unless she has proof, and she can't get any proof without Archer's help. She needs him in order to write a good story. This is somewhat hypocritical when considering her disapproval over Solomon's treatment: \\"I'm using him, and you're using me,\\" says Archer, \\"and that is the way it works.\\"    Unfortunately, there's truth to that statement, one of the many aforementioned harsh truths that are brought to light. It's refreshing for a film like \\"Blood Diamond\\" to present them, especially since it can offer a way to learn about something consumers take for granted. The three characters also have learning experiences, in one form or another. Archer probably has the greatest one; Solomon briefly reunites with his family at the fence of a refugee camp, only to learn that his young son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) has been taken by the RUF. While seeing this does little to diminish Archer's desire to possess the hidden diamond, that one moment of love and anguish still leaves an impression, one that enables a better understanding of Solomon's determination.    His desperate feelings are easy to understand from the audience's point of view, and they're completely validated in scenes involving Dia and Captain Poison. They're effectively uncomfortable to watch; the young boy is slowly being brainwashed into believing as the RUF do. Captain Poison immediately takes Dia under his wing in order to make him easier to manipulate. He and other children undergo rigorous training, most of which include the use of firearms. I distinctly remember one moment when Dia is blindfolded and handed a machine gun. He's then obeys the order to pull the trigger. When he removes the blindfold, he realizes that he killed a refugee purposely put in the line of fire.    There are many such moments in this film, all of which are unpleasant but nonetheless relevant. The violence and inhumanity is quick, raw, and ugly: many are shot dead; an RUF soldier severs the right hand of a young boy; Captain Poison injects Dia with some kind of drug, presumably heroine. They act as counterpoints to the belief that humans are inherently good at heart; Solomon believes that his son is still the good soul he was before he was captured. \\"You'll be a doctor someday,\\" he often said to young Dia, who would go to school everyday, even when he didn't quite feel up to it. There's a perfect balance at work here, informing the audience with a mixture of disturbing imagery and enlightening moments of compassion and understanding.    As Archer, Solomon, and Maddy continue their journey, this understanding grows deeper. The uncertainty grows, as well: Solomon may never reunite with his family; Archer may never find that precious diamond; Maddy's scoop on Sierra Leone's diamond trade may forever be unprinted; the RUF may continue to rule with an iron fist. How ironic that their motto was: \\"No More Slaves, No More Masters. Power and Wealth to the People.\\" It makes one wonder whether or not they understood the power of their words, especially since they used them to encourage both acts of violence and undeserved loyalty. \\"Blood Diamond\\" does a wonderful job of examining this complex belief system, something that for many years was the reality for the people of Sierra Leone. I'm thankful for having seen this film; it's an eye-opening depiction of a real life crisis, one that a lot people have yet to learn about.

FutureSexLoveSounds, Chop me up (that's the JAM right there), Summer Love, SexyBack, What Goes Around, Comes Around, and My Love are the best in my opinion.

B00008L3U1|5.0|Jack is the kind of movie that will make you remember how much fun it was to be a child, and interestingly enough, it will also remind you how difficult it was to fit in and become friends with the other children.  Robin Williams plays an excellent role in this film.  His character is totally believable.  Just imagine what would happen if a 40-year old man tried going back to school with children?  The way the children responded to it would probably be the same response if such an incident were to happen in real life.  You will love this movie, especially if you're an adult who loves movies that are both funny and contain good drama.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|After a long wait of almost 30 years, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is finally here... <br /> <br />Before I get into the specifics about the DC--Some Background: <br /> <br />In the decade of the 1970's Superman The Movie and 80% of its sequel Superman II were shot simultaneously. <br /> <br />Originally conceived by director Richard Donner and writer Tom Mankiewicz as a two-part story...The 2 friends, along with a talented cast and crew of hundreds, set out to make us \\"believe a man can fly\\"....They succeeded beyond all measure. <br /> <br />As the release date for the first film loomed, it was decided to halt production on II, in favor of finishing the first part. Once that movie was in the can and in theaters , everyone would return to complete the rest of II.. <br /> <br />However, by this point tensions between Donner and producers--Alexander Salkind, his son Ilya, and Pierre Spengler--were so bad that Donner was fired before he could finish part II. Director Richard Lester was brought in, to not only finish the film, but rework many scenes as well. This reboot was necessary in order for Lester to receive a director credit on the film... <br /> <br />I must admit, the first time I popped the Donner Cut of Superman II into the DVD player, I got a few goosebumps as things got under way.... <br /> <br />The basic story of the film is the same as it is in theatrical version. It's the way Donner gets from points A to B and so on that's different... <br /> <br />Some examples: <br /> <br />Gone: The entire post credit Paris sequence in which a bomb, detonated in space by Superman (Christopher Reeve) releases the three villains from Krypton...Replaced with a scene from the first film of the Man Of Steel disposing of one of the missiles hijacked by Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman)--causing the trio's escape. <br /> <br />Gone: Scenes between Superman and his biological mother Lara (Susannah York) are replaced by scenes between Supes and his biological father Jor-El (Marlon Brando) <br /> <br />Gone: The scene in The Honeymoon Haven in which Lois (Margot Kidder) discovers Clark Kent is Superman with him tripping over a (pink) bareskin rug. Replaced with Lois pulling a gun on our hero--forcing him to reveal his secret... <br /> <br />The ultimate question of which version is better is a toughie though--Watching the Donner Cut made feel like kid again and that I had traveled back in time to some alternate reality--there's some really great stuff here...But I actually think the theatrical version paces better. I'm sure that Donner would have addressed this issue had he been allowed to finish the film...I know this may sound like a cop out--the 2 versions each have things that work in them and some things that don't. <br /> <br />For example, the Jor-El scenes are much more meaningful to me than the Lara theatrical stuff. It's the whole Father/Son dynamic. The whole Clark is Supes reveal put into motion by Lois is much stronger as well. The Phantom Zone villains seem a bit more menacing. The battle over Metropolis is more streamlined--Gone is Lester's campy schtick and sight gags in that sequence... <br /> <br />The biggest issues I had with the Donner Cut has to do with some of the editorial choices made: (Beware Spoilers!!) <br /> <br />DC producer Michael Thau and Donner chose to score this version by laying in music from the first film. While I love John Williams' work. I have to admit it was a bit of a distraction hearing music that fits the first movie so well, used for this cut. At times the score sounded out of place and disjointed I wish they could have found a way to use more of Ken Thorne's arrangements. I think that would have worked better. <br /> <br />The Donner Cut has Supes sleeping with Lois before he gives up his powers...While this solves a major plot issue I had with Bryan Singer's Superman Returns--but only till the end if the film. Still, it begs the question, why does he need to give up his powers at all? If hecan have his abilities and be with Lois anyway--Why bother asking for Dad's permission. <br /> <br />Folks have complained that the DC lifts the time travel ending of the first film--Supes turning back the world, to undo the damage done by the villains and to make Lois forget that Clark Kent is Supes. At face value, that criticism is a valid one. And indeed, Lester's Super smooch ending was considered as the ending for the DC, but remember, Donner never had the chance to finish II the way he had wanted or could have. Therefore, I can see them reusing the concept again, since Superman The Movie would have originally ended with the Zoners escape cliffhanger...I think using it save Lois in One packs more of an emotional wallop though. I'm fine with our hero turning back the world again in lieu of using the kiss from Lester's cut <br /> <br />Given that, Superman does reverse time in this version though...Why does Clark go back to Ron's Diner to give Rocky (Pepper Martin) the bully a taste of his own medicine--if their fight never happened? Yes it's still funny but it makes no narrative sense.  <br /> <br />All of that said, I am thankful for the chance to finally see this stuff, and that Donner is finally getting to close the book on a very painful chapter of his career. The DC, while far from perfect, is still a must see. After you see the DC you may never look Ar Superman II the same way again... <br /> <br />The bonus material on the DVD includes a touching intro from Donner, 8 minutes worth of deleted scenes, most of which, I've seen before in various TV cuts of the film. There's an alternate prison escape for Luthor though that's \\"new\\" and a lot of fun. Restoring The Vision is a 13 minute featurette that discusses the restoration process of Thau and his team. The most worthwhile extra on the disc is the audio commentary from Donner and Mankiewicz. <br /> <br />It's obvious that Donner is still very hurt by what happened between him and the producers, The duo getpretty quiet whenever Lester's footage appears on screen to help fill in some of the gaps. Otherwise it's filled with some great production tid-bits Some of which are repeated from their 2001 track for the first film. Still, the track is solid  <br /> <br />Donner says he was fired without reason. Ilya Salkind maintains in the audio commentary for the theatrical cut that Donner was invited to finish 2 but refused as long as \\"Spengler was still on the film\\"--via an interview in Variety. Assuming Salkind is telling the truth--why have Lester on the set to mediate during the first film (as stated on the other DVDs) if they weren't thinking of replacing Donner at some point --that was before the Variety story? What a shame... <br /> <br />At least some of that \\"wrong\\" has now been put \\"right\\"
0743298020|3.0|I don't mean this to be a spoiler per se, but more of a warning about some of the content.  The book itself was fine.  It starts out better than it turns out to be.  It in no way, shape or form deserves any serious comparsion to great literature such as Jane Eyre.  But it's a quick enough read and it is fairly well written.   <br /> <br />I personally do not care to read books where incest is a component of the story.  It does not have graphically described sex scenes, mind you, but it is there.  There's also one brief scene where one teenage girl sexually molests another teenage girl.  I don't care to read that kind of thing; I don't think it adds anything to this plot.  Frankly, I would not have purchased this book if I had known it contained these elements. <br /> <br />If that doesn't bother you at all, then consider you might very well agree with the many glowing reviews other readers have given this book.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|Visually speaking, _FF VII: AC_ is stunning.  The animation is amazing, the character design is impressive, and you can stare at the landscapes for hours on end and never see the same thing twice.  The plot of _Advent Children_, however is sorely lacking.  If you're already familiar forwards and backwards with the plot and nuances of the video game you'll pick up on a lot of things immediately and probably not care too much about the lack of characterization, the requisite \\"hero's friends coming out of nowhere to save the day\\", and the appearances of some old favorite characters for no other reason than to make the watcher squee with delight. <br /> <br />Beyond that, however, there isn't a whole lot that you're going to take with you from this movie unless you buy the published director's notes (or read the translation online, because that particular book wasn't published in the states, or at least it hasn't been yet).  It's pretty.  It's amazingly pretty.  It's as close as cinema has come so far to a perfect marriage of anime's surrealistic style with characters that are close enough approximations to real people that some friends I showed the trailer to thought it was a live-action  movie.  But this movie's lots of pretty battle scenes and not a lot else. <br /> <br />If you look, there might be something here for you, but on the whole this isn't the end-all-be-all of movies or anime.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Recently I've been finally watching all of my epic dvds ( anything over 3 hours) I bought over 3 years ago, and truly enjoyed seeing Titanic on dvd for the first time! It was amazing how quickly this beautiful story just flowed perfectly,and the 3 hours and 15 minutes just flew by. I've always enjoyed period pieces and this was such a fabulous step back in time, Kate Winslet looked magnificent in every scene. Each gown, hat, and piece of jewelry were perfect!!!    Although I'm sure James Cameron was not one of the nicest directors, during the shooting of this epic masterpiece, he truly deserved feeling like \\"THE KING OF THE WORLD\\" after winning the academy awards for Best Director and Best Picture. He had such an eye for detail in every scene, especially during the sinking of the Titanic, right down to the dishes falling to pieces!    When the Special Edition of Titanic was released I decided not to purchase it because Titanic is so magical that I don't want to know how all the special effects were done, it's like a magician revealing the secrets and mystery behind the illusion.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Just got it...GOOD PRICE!!!!!  Its good to have a 29 disc in little space, and the Rambaldi artifact ...nice..!! But the problem is that the discs are protected in a case inside like a little book, just with paper, so the disc is just in thick paper, like a haft bag.  You have to be careful when handling them to prevent scratching them when you are taking out or in the disc. But is a nice presentation for the collection.

B000JJRIN4|4.0|I was surprised to see how many people are giving this negative reviews. I personally think that this is one of those albums you have to listen to a few times first before deciding on whether or not you like it. I admit when I first heard this album, I didn't like it at first either. After listening to this a few times, the songs really started to grow on me and now I really like this album. Same thing happened with LAMB the first time I heard it, and is now one of my all-time favorite cd's.    My favorite songs are Wonderful Life, Flourescent, Sweet Escape, and Don't Get it Twisted. Yummy is one of those where you either like it or you don't, I didn't like it at first but I am finding that this one is catching on and i'm growing to like more. I truly think this will become the Hollaback Girl of this album and will be a huge hit! Don't Get it Twisted has a circus-type feel and is creative, very different and fun. Now that you got has a great beat and is a catchy song that is sure to get stuck in your head for awhile.     Just about every song has the potential to become a huge hit for Gwen, here are the ones that I think will probably be the biggest:    Sweet Escape  Yummy  4 in the Morning  Now that you Got It  Wonderful Life    Gwen is very talented and is a true artist, she has such a unique music and fashion style that separates herself from other artists out there. If you don't like the album the first time listening to it, give it a chance and listen to it a few more times - then decide, you might be surprised.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|The fast and the furious is one of the best movies ever made. Its action packed from start to finnish and has 100's of sick cars. The cast of the fast and the furious are very good and they go great together. Plus since you cant actually race legally you still get to see it which is the next best thing. Dont listen to the other revewers who gave this movie a low ranking...this movie is deffinantly worth the money and you can watch it over and over again without getting bored.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I picked THE OPEN DOOR up a couple of months ago and after quite a few listens am finally prepared to evaluate it.<br /><br />First off, let me say that FALLEN isn't the masterpiece that many hail it as. It's a good female-fronted gothic-tinged new metal album with a few great tracks, but it's not as stellar as the hype suggests.<br /><br />Evanescence subsequently lost their primary songwriter, Ben Moody, and I was curious how their new material would stand up to FALLEN.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: First of all, I think we all can agree that Amy Lee is one of the most beautiful women to ever walk the earth, and her voice is angelic.<br /><br />Ben Moody's replacement, Terry Balsamo, is definitely a worthy proxy; a professional metal guitarist and song-writer in every sense.<br /><br />The production is incredible -- crisp, clear and heavy; I'm not sure if I've ever heard a better SOUNDING recording.<br /><br />The very first song, \\"Sweet Sacrifice,\\" kicks some serious arse. This sole tune expertly obliterates any doubts concerning whether or not Evanescence could carry on without Moody.<br /><br />One of the songs, \\"Lacrymosa,\\" features full-on orchestration.<br /><br />I really can't say there's a bad song on the (very long) album; it's, at least, enjoyable from beginning to end. Nothing makes me cringe, but I'm not compelled to listen to it repeatedly either.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As I see it, THE OPEN DOOR has the same problem that plagued FALLEN: the songs are simply too samey-sounding. Yes, the creative ideas abound and the instrumentation is plentiful, but the numbers are somehow too indistinguishable. On their next release they need to tweak the song-writing and production to make their tunes more distinguishable.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you liked FALLEN you probably won't be disappointed with THE OPEN DOOR. It's a worthy follow-up and natural progression. The production and musicianship are of the finest expertise. Their gothic/near-opera/modern metal material is classy, slick, serious, heavy and mature; no bubble-gum rock here, that's for sure. The only flaw is that the songs are too similar-sounding.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to a long and laudable career for Amy Lee and Evanescence. THE OPEN DOOR is an enjoyable and impressive progression along that journey.material is classy, slick, serious, heavy and mature; no bubble-gum rock here, that's for sure.

B00000JBFW|5.0|Should you ever meet someone who's ranting about \\"the eighties\\" and the supposedly \\"bad\\" music of that decade... just put on this GREAT record!<br /><br />The songs are well crafted, perfectly recorded and the whole album is absolutely NOT \\"trendy\\". With that I mean that you could never tell it was made in 1984. Clearly you can spot it's not from the seventies... but listening back to it, NOW, I notice how it hasn't aged a bit!<br /><br />...and it features the most classic lineup of the band!<br /><br />You just couldn't ask for more!! ;-)
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I consider myself to be an environmentalist and I believe the facts Al Gore presents in the film.  But I wish he would have presented them in a more interesting way.  I'm sorry, but I can't stand to listen to Gore's voice for an hour and a half, straight.  Especially when I'm only given graphs and photographs to look at, and the occassional pan over to a dis-interested audience member in the lecture hall.  My husband and I both fell asleep about half way through the movie, even though we were excited about renting it.  I prefer documentaries that teach me something, without naking me feel like I'm in school.  This film is such a shame, because I think it is based on the very serious and urgent message of global warming, but the delivery will turn people off, like it did with me.  And there is really only enough information here to take up about 30 min. or so.  How many different way does Gore feel he has to show that the earth is heating up?!
1563890119|2.0|\\"When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up,\\" said C. S. Lewis.  He was defending his love of fairy tales, but perhaps similar things could be said about those who enjoy reading comic books, an art-form that, like fairy tales, some think is fit only for children.  Perhaps he who, at age 50, can admit without shame that he still enjoy reading his old Stan Lee Spidermans, is perhaps more truly adult than he who would squirm with embarrassment at the thought.<br /><br />\\"Sandman\\" is, in the Lewisian sense, far more childish than anything written by Stan Lee.  It is a comic book that tries desperately to prove that it is sophisticated adult material.  The usual methods employed are:  (1) hideous art - sufficient to cause any child to throw the title aside at one glance; (2) completely amoral protagonists; (3) sporadic but explicit sexual content; (4) grim and gory violence; (5) obvious - but incoherent - allegorical elements; (6) an incoherent assortment of historical, mythological, and literary references; and (7) confusing narrative gimmicks that force readers to use extra brain cells to follow an otherwise simple plot.<br /><br />Gaiman has explained that the Sandman comics are about the telling of stories.  That sounds grand, but means little.  Art, if it is meaningful to mortals, must ultimately reflect on Reality in some way.  Art that is merely about Art is ultimately about nothing.  But if Gaiman means that his stories are derivative, borrowing fragments here and there from better artists while still retaining some of their original power, then I suspect that would be hitting close to the truth - (though I myself recognize only a few of his sources).<br /><br />Okay, so what's it all about?  (Warning:  SPOILERS).<br /><br />These comics are about an Evil Nerd -- but not just any Evil Nerd. He is a Nerd God -- the ultra-powerful ruler of the realm of Dreams, and has lots of cool names like Morpheus, or Kai'chul, or Oneiros, or Sandman, or simply Dream.  He is one of the Endless, a group of seven mostly-evil gods whose names all begin with D  -- Destiny, Death, Dream, Despair, Desire, Destruction, and Delirium.  Though he supposedly rules all dreams, Nerd-Man seems to traffic mainly in nightmares (in this volume, anyway). The most benevolent and likeable of his siblings is Death - a perky goth chick, introduced near the end of this volume, who rescues mortals from the miseries inflicted by the other six -- though what becomes of them thereafter is unclear.<br /><br />The Nerd God is ultra-cool.  He can assume many forms, but usually looks like Neil Gaiman (tall, lanky, white dude, likes to dress in black , with lots of hair, lots of nose, and a craggy face).  He also has an ultra-cool scary voice -- represented by white text within a black balloon.  He has black eyes like bottomless pits that reflect the universe, as though he were wearing a built in pair of the coolest shades imaginable.<br /><br />In his volume, Nerd-Man is captured and imprisoned for 70 years by cultists who were trying to capture Death, but who capture Nerd-Man instead.  Nerd-Man is too cool to negotiate with enemies, so he just sits and glares at his captors for 70 years.  He finally breaks free, and, since his original captor is long dead, instead inflicts horrible vengeance on the successor.  Ignoring pleas for mercy, the ultra-cool Nerd Man curses the successor to a horrible never-waking nightmare.  This demonstrates that no-one should mess with Nerd-Man!<br /><br />Seeking to restore himself to full power, Nerd-Man then sets out to recover three artifacts he lost when he was captured, which is the occasion for various adventures.  The most memorable of these is a trip to Hell, which ironically seems a welcome break from the horrors of Earth.  After arriving in hell, Evil Nerd-Man faces off against Lucifer, Baalzebub, and a vast army of demons, and proves that he is infinitelycooler than all of them combined.<br /><br />Nerd Man defeats the demons by pointing out to them that without the dream of Heaven, Hell would have no power over its inmates.  This seems a cynical thought, directly contrary to the theological notion (derived from the idea of a forgiving, merciful God) that that it is despair of Heaven that empowers Hell.  But it is not a rejection of the idea of an afterlife as such, because Death elsewhere tells a mortal that oblivion is not an option.  It is not otherwise clear what aspect of Heaven is being objected to.  Is it the hope of happiness?  Or is it aspirations toward goodness?  Does Gaiman, like Ayn Rand, think altruism is the root of all misery?<br /><br />Another significant thing that happens, on his visit to Hell, is that Nerd Man encounters an old flame, and once again displays his ultra-cool.  In order to fully appreciate this episode, you will need to know a little more of its background (in an episode which, in some editions of Preludes and Nocturnes, is reserved for the beginning of the next volume).<br /><br />You see, ten thousand years earlier there was this Snotty Babe, who lived in a City of Glass.  Snotty Babe was the most beautiful Babe in the world, but she would turn up her nose at all the dudes, considering herself too good for them.  This went on until a mysterious Nerd came wandering through, who, just by looking up at her from the street below, caused Snotty Babe to fall madly in love with him.<br /><br />So Snotty Babe searches high and low for the mysterious Nerd Man.  She has no success, until the King of Birds directs her to the Palace of Dreams.  \\"Wow,\\" says Nerd Man, \\"No one has ever sought me out before.  We must be meant for each other.  Let's get it on.\\"  But Snotty Babe refuses, because she realizes this is not just any Nerd-Man, but the Nerd God himself - and she suspects that boinking a Nerd God can have horrific consequences.<br /><br />But Evil Nerd Man is far too cool to take no for an answer, so he pursues the Snotty Babe.  Snotty Babe takes her own virginity with a sharp rock, hoping this will cause Nerd Man to lose interest.  But Evil Nerd Man just says \\"I'm not interested in your body,\\" and proceeds to give her a super-hot boinking.  (That's two non-sequiturs in a row - but what do you expect from the Lord of Dreams?)<br /><br />The sex is hot, but Snotty Babe is a complainer.  \\"Look,\\" she cries.  \\"My beloved City of Glass has just been smashed to smithereens, all because I boinked an Evil Nerd God.\\"  \\"I'm too cool to care,\\" says Evil Nerd God, \\"Prepare to be boinked some more.<br /><br />But Snotty Babe is not nearly as cool as Evil Nerd God, and throws herself off a cliff to prevent any further boinking-induced calamities.  Evil Nerd God, however, is the ultimate stalker, and pursues her into the Realm of Death.  \\"Listen up, Snotty Babe,\\" he says \\"I'm too cool for this nonsense.  Either be my Queen, or endure eternal torment.\\"  Well, Snotty Babe can't take a hint, so Nerd Man condemns Snotty Babe to Hell.<br /><br />Well, ten thousand years later, during the just-mentioned trip to Hell, Nerd Man by chance runs into Snotty Babe, still enduring the torments of Hell.  Snotty no longer, she begs for her release:  \\"Don't you love me any more?  Don't you forgive me?\\"  Nerd Man does not like seeing her in torment, but being Ultra-Cool is a hard and lonely duty.  \\"Yes, I still love you,\\" he intones sadly, \\"But even after ten thousand years, I do not forgive you.\\"  And Evil Nerd Man walks away.<br /><br />Whoah!  How cool is that!  I want to be just like Evil Nerd Man.  Then, I too can force Snotty Babes to fall in love with me just by glancing at them.  Then, I too, can take them by force if they perversely attempt to deny their love for me.  Then I, too, can punish them horribly if they then fail to show sufficient gratitude for this favor.  Then I too can sadly refuse as they grovel at my feet begging my forgiveness.

0743455967|5.0|<br />As interesting as it is to read into the life of the man behind larger-than-life works such as the Dark Tower series, Salem's Lot, and the more recent Lisey's Story, the true gem here is King's advice on writing.  This was infinitely more helpful than any other book \\"on writing\\" that I've read. <br /> <br />King tells you how to relate a good story, all without copying his style.  Now, some of his suggestions I don't agree with, such as not describing precisely how a character looks--that is important to me.  But some of the things that he says are brilliant, and have completely transformed and, in my opinion, elevated my fiction. <br /> <br />There is one cost that comes with reading this book.  You'll never be able to read another book without a critical eye again!  King makes \\"flaw finding\\" easy.  But it is well worth the cost of becoming a good writer. <br /> <br />9/10
1582701709|4.0|As I stare at this blank screen before me, I am aware of one thing; Infinite Possibility. To me, a blank piece of paper, or an empty canvas, or a blank computer screen are metaphors for Possibility and so as I begin to write my review, I am aware that my closest companion in any given situation is Possibility Itself. That is why I loved the movie, The Secret so much. That is why I literally gushed in my review of the movie and yet I had some comments on my review that I was a \\"professional advertiser\\", that I was getting paid for my endorsement of the movie, that I was attempting to sell a \\"mystical bill of goods\\" because I dubbed myself as a \\"Light Coach\\". I am a Light Coach...I am a Spiritual Counselor and one of the things I desire to have happen in my life is that I will be able to make it my \\"full-time career\\" instead of it just being a part-time gig.<br /><br />I am excited about this movie and this book, The Secret, for one reason; because it is an idea whose time has come. Yes, this book will be dismissed just as the movie was dismissed, but out of the hundreds of people that may dismiss it, there is going to be one person that gets it. By getting it, I do not mean, a pure intellectual understanding of it. What I mean, is that this person embodies the information. One reviewer said that this was all \\"common sense\\". What I have found on my journey is that common sense is not too common. Most of us are operating on old scripts from the past. Most of us are operating on unconscious conditioning. If everybody did what they say they know, this world would not be in the situation that we are in now.<br /><br />I love the line that Dr. Michael Beckwith says, \\"What thought has done, it can undo...\\" He is paraphrasing the late, great Ernest Holmes, founder of Religious Science, who probably paraphrased it from somebody else, and so on and so on. One reviewer asks, \\"Is there anything new under the sun?\\"<br /><br />No. There most assuredly is not. What we must do is apply those things that we thought we knew. If we wish for our life to transform we must daily take the time to see our lives becoming the way we say we desire them to be. Yes, a lot of New Thought/Spiritual/Metaphysical people just get caught in the thinking that all they have to do is envision their dreams and they'll happen, and sometimes, they're right, sometimes dreams just seem to appear out of thin air...but many times we need to act on those things that we say we desire to be in our lives and the book and the movie reminds us of this constantly. Pulling no punches, I often find myself good at envisioning what I desire, but lacking in the action department. That is why I loved the movie and that is why I like the book; it reminds me constantly of those things that I need to consciously and deliberately practice. Not out of a feeling of \\"not being good enough\\", but out of a feeling, that I am good enough to be what I say I want to be, do what I say I wish to do, and have those things that I say I desire to have. What I find pretty funny is that the reviewers who say that this is all about materialism are missing one of the greatest truths of the universe and that is, we were all born to live life and to live life abundantly in EVERY SINGLE AREA of our lives.<br /><br />I do not necessarily think that this book or this movie wants us to ignore the poor, the hungry, the sick, the lonely, etc. What I think the movie and the book stress is to not get \\"caught up\\" in the appearances. When we just focus on \\"what is\\" instead of \\"what can be\\" we are contributing to the continuation of whatever it is that we are looking at. Jesus the Christ was able to heal not because he focused on the disease or the appearance of the situation he was in, but by looking at the Infinite Source of Possibility, GOD!<br /><br />And to me, this is what the film and the book are all about; focusing on where you want to go with your life. I could sit around and complain about how unfair life has been to me, or I could realize that today is a \\"blank piece of paper\\"...a \\"clean slate\\" in which I can decide once again what I want my life to be about. That every single moment of life has brought me to right here and right now and that is a blessing in itself.<br /><br />I liked this book...not as much as the movie, but I am still not sad that I made the investment. And yes, I may have hundreds of books that may sound the same, but sometimes, just a little derivation in the way something is said can change everything. I would also like to stress that it will not be the book or the movie that will transform our lives; that job belongs to us. \\"Common Sense\\", I know, but for the most part I really don't think that the majority of people in the world today really don't think or feel that they have control over their thoughts, their feelings, and what happens in their lives. Most of us, and I have done so myself for many, many years, are on auto-pilot. But we can choose again. We can rise up from the ashes of the past and reclaim the Wholeness that is our Holiness and the Holiness that is our Wholeness.<br /><br />And one last thing, to the person who thought I was in professional advertising and wrote for a living, would you like to hire me? For you see, I am currently using this \\"Law of Attraction stuff\\" to be guided and directed to a wonderful new career. I know and I feel that something great will be coming my way just like I know and feel something great is about to happen in your life, as well!<br /><br />Peace and Blessings.air life has been to me, or I could realize that today is a \\"blank piece of paper\\"...a \\"clean slate\\" in which I can decide once again what I want my life to be about.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Superman II was one of my favorite movies EVER. How much I liked it? I saw it in the theaters 10 times. Well, it was back in the days when I was in my early teens and the tickets local theater was only $2.00.    When it premiered on ABC, I was pratically orgasming with new deleted footages. Of all the Superman movies, this one was the best (the long dragged out death scene of Lois in the first movie totally ruined THAT for me).    It wasn't until recently that I found out about the controversy surronding the film: how the original director Richard Donner was fired and pratically most of Superman II that I saw and loved was re-writtened and re-filmed; and a lot of the deleted stuff I saw on TV, which I thought was edited out of the theaterical release due to time constraints (and violence) was actually stuff shot by Donner.    Well, in any case, I feel that Richard Lester should be applauded and commended, not villified and maligned, for making and salvaging Superman II as he did. It wasn't his fault that the producers and Donner had a disagreement over the creative approach to the movie. And talk about the power of suggestion! I never noticed the differences between his footage or Donner's, or give them much thought until I learn about the controversy.     Years later, with the Richard Donner's cut finally released, we can see what Superman II might have been. One thing you should not expect to see is a FULL COMPLETE movie (this includes the music, special effects, and tight editing). Given that Donner never finished the film, or have even written a new ending for Superman II, there has to been certain compromises made (like using screen tests and re-using like the much maligned turning back time ending). Thus, treat the Donner's version of Superman II was a sort of a \\"rough cut\\".    My impression is that Superman II could have been a movie of EPIC scope had Donner been allowed to stay on board the project, and I am not taking away any of Lester's work on the film.In Donner's version, I particular like Lois Lane's schemes in making Clark Kent admitting that he is Superman, and the added violence on the part of the Phantom Zone villains. But however, ironically, a lot was cut with their confrontation with Clifton James and them wreaking havoc on the town.    However, vastly overrated is the much anticipated footage of Marlon Brando's Jor-El. I am sorry, at this point in his career, Brando was no longer acting, he was merely capitalizing on his legendary star status by taking bit parts and recieving top billing and outrageous amount of money. I much prefered Susannah York's Lara, who generated warmth, compassion and sincerity than Brando's sterile performance.    In all, the Donner Cut of Superman II is not a complete movie but do give us an alternate version of the film. But what is done is done. Hopefully, they will release an extended cut of Superman II that combine footages by the two directors (like the ABC version) (but do keep the Susannah York scenes!)
B00005JPC7|5.0|I never saw this Maggie Gyllenhaal before. What a beautiful specimen. I would like to pump a million babies into her.<br /><br />While I was expecting this movie to have some sort of romance aspect, I didn't think it would be her character right away. Yet her presence was well observed by me from the first frame of her lovely face. What a sweet, sweet baker, Ana Pasquel.<br /><br />I dug this movie, as I knew I would. However it is not as dark as I expected it to be. Although, it does seem to reflect much work from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Spottless Mind, Adaptation), it has more of a lightheared feel than his scripts. Although, much of the same, bizzare, somewhat silly, mind screw situations that made all of those movies great.<br /><br />Will Ferrel is great as HArold Crick. A man who is a succsesful IRS auditor, who has no intention of falling out of his day to day routine. That is, until he starts to hear a voice in his head, narrating his life.<br /><br />Eventually the voice tells him that a malfunction from his wrist watch, is going to result in his imminent death, and this eventually causes him to do away with his standard day to day routine, and make some changes. Also to find out what the deal is with the voice.<br /><br />By the end, you may notice in the back of your head, that certain questions never get answered in this film- but I won't tell you whatt those are, because its all part of the fun. There are a few different character plots.. like the one of the actual woman who is in the process of writing the book about Harold Crick, who is a very strange woman, but an equally enjoyable character.<br /><br />If you like movies that fall off the beaten path, and into a mindbending sort of acid trip, than you will dig this movie... although it does stay shy of getting too dramatic... this one is just for fun. And I guarantee that Ana Pasquel character, is a lot of fun too!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I bought this CD when it came out last spring. 6 months later and it is still the top 25 on my iPod. Absolutely killer stuff. <br /> <br />I've been a Peppers fan since Uplift Mofo came out when I was in high school, and this CD blows away ANYTHING they have ever done before. It is deep, textured, intelligent, and beautiful. Anthony's lyrics are poetry, and you can't say enough about Flea and Chad Smith. <br /> <br />But without a doubt, this CD is John F.'s masterpiece. He is a genius, weaving simple, percussive guitar parts, complex rhythms, pristine clean guitars and gritty, grinding, sweaty solos into a work of art. As always, he makes extensive use of flamenco progressions, but there are also sprinkles of jazz, soul, and Beatlesque pop throughout. Even better are the thick layers of vocal harmonies he's added, which really enhance and soften (and lessen the annoyance!) of Anthony's chant-singing. <br /> <br />This is a CD for all fans of true musicianship. The songwriting is superb, the production is perfect (Rick Rubin, of course), and you can listen 100 times and hear something new each time. Definitely the best of 2006.
B000IY041S|5.0|This breathtaking DVD is a must buy for any Rammstein Fan...   <br /> <br />General: <br />When Rammstein released Voelkerball this past November, I was disappointed to learn there was no America release date.  However, frankly that doesn't matter, as even though this DVD is \\"Imported\\", it is fully compatible with my NTSC Region 1 DVD player.  Also, it may say 3-6 weeks for shipping, but may it be known that I received my copy in under a week. <br /> <br />The DVD: <br />Overall amazing, in my opinion the best Rammstein Live DVD yet.  It makes up for the bad filming of Live Aus Berlin and the overall lackluster of Lichtspielhaus.  The actual full length concert was filmed in Nimes, France, but there are also live performances from London, Moscow, and Tokyo.  If you are at all hesitant to buy this DVD, based on the fact it has no \\"new\\" material, I would strongly recommend you go ahead anyway as Rammstein Live is nothing like their studio albums.  They sound infinitely better! <br /> <br />Tracklisting: <br />France: Les Arenes de Nimes <br />01. Reise, Reise <br />02. Links 2 3 4 <br />03. Keine Lust <br />04. Feuer Frei! <br />05. Asche zu Asche <br />06. Morgenstern <br />07. Mein Teil <br />08. Stein um Stein <br />09. Los <br />10. Du Riechst so Gut <br />11. Benzin <br />12. Du Hast <br />13. Sehnsucht <br />14.

GREAT JOB RAMMSTEIN!
0804115613|5.0|I read this book several years ago and have re-read it several times.  It is one of those books you pick up when you are a little bit sad or cynical, and it makes you laugh and cry and feel better about the world.  The characters all seem like real people by the time you are through with the book.  I absolutely love it (her other books are good too, but this is my favorite).  And the recipes in the back are WONDERFUL!!!  It's a must-read.:)
B000I5X81K|2.0|I adore Josh Groban's vocal passion and have about worn his first two CDs out from playing them over and over and over again. So, of course, I impatiently awaited the new release. I am so sorely disappointed in Awake I could cry. Only in a few of his songs do you find the Groban soul stirring, uplifting passion....the others fall so flat it pains me to listen to them. Sadly, it will probably be another three years before the next release and I won't be looking forward to it with the same \\"night before Christmas\\" anticipation as I did for Awake. So sorry, Josh. I REALLY wanted to love it!
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I like to wait to review until I have listened to all the songs quite a few times - so here it goes.  My favorites are Sweet Escape, Early Winter (a slow song), Yummy (a fun song), Don't Get it Twisted (great beat), and Wonderful Life.  I really don't like Orange County Girl, U Started It, and Wind It Up.  I think Wind It Up was a really weak choice for a single.      Some of the songs drive me crazy because they lack melody or chorus or....there's just something missing.  They only consist of horribly childish lyrics put over a strange beat.  But some of the other songs are really pretty good, so I don't regret the purchase.  If you like Wind It Up...you will probably love the whole album.  If you hate Wind It Up...you will probably like half or none of the album.    Best Bets:  Sweet Escape  Early Winter  Don't Get It Twisted  Yummy  Wonderful Life
0385507755|3.0|I was looking for a book on Amazon that a friend recommend, got the name wrong and accidentall ordered this one. At first I thought it was good, obviously imitative of Raymond Chandler et al and written what I imagine ee cummings wrote poetry like, if I had the patience for poetry. Maybe more like Faux David Mamet Lite. Anyway, at first I was enjoying the book then about a fifth of the way in I noticed part just kept ringing hollow. I went back and read the cover and found what I considered a clue in the Bret blurb about it being a great \\"performance\\" piece. Exactly, Bret. Half way through my husband asked if the book was any good, I said still reading, without thinking, \\"No, the author is too manipulative\\". And I knew it was true as soon as I said it. At the end of the day, the book is just too phony. The judge character is so obviously based on a number of Morgan Freeman movie performances its silly. The Roy character being outed to the group by staff as having a \\"multiple personality disorder\\" was the first truly phony moment I can recall in the book. The \\"bloody club\\" scene with Roy was just weirdly out of place and embarassing stuck in there. Plus, patient confidentiality anyone??? The deus ex machina grungy guy from Chicago that just shows up and tells the main character his new love interest's entire sexual history in five minutes? One of my favorite annoying thing was how the main character over and over talks about his whole life experience as significant evidence for something - at 23? The character's arrogant over-confident belief in his own life conclusions and experiences, especially about AA and true addiction are just pathetically sad at times because you get the feeling the author actually believes this and is not being ironic. The main character finally just comes across as a spoiled bourgeois bully latch-key kid (that had a lot of his parents money at his disposal over time; \\"So I flew back to Paris and did some more crack and beat up a priest, blah blah, blah...\\") that abused a lot of drugs until he scared himself silly by breaking his teeth and cutting his face (check out the author's picture after reading about how ravaged his face was in his vaguely described accident) and then after a stay in dry out place he quit...and probably went right back to his parent-assisted bourgeois life map, convinced that his years of drug abuse were really addiction and he is one tuff dude. The real eye-rolling scene for me was the bar scene at the end where the main character goes in and orders the drink. Pretty much _just_ like the Woody Harrelson character in the movie Palmetto. Go you tuff guy you. One last annoying thing - how the main character constantly goes on about how beautiful the love interest and how he so unselfishly loves her sexlessly and despite all her flaws. Blah blah blah. So admirable. How bigof him. And he is such a catch. Ack. Then the killing off of that love interest character, just like in a comic book. Just kept making me think of the The Crow comic book. Overall, an interesting (and easy) to read book, but often annoying if you are over say 30 years old and know anything at all about real life drug/alchol addiction.h blah, blah...\\") that abused a lot of drugs until he scared himself silly by breaking his teeth and cutting his face (check out the author's picture after reading about how ravaged his face was in his vaguely described accident) and then after a stay in dry out place he quit...and probably went right back to his parent-assisted bourgeois life map, convinced that his years of drug abuse were really addiction and he is one tuff dude.

B000JVT09C|5.0|I've viewed several of the Blu Ray releases available and for my money this is by far the best looking one to date. Many of the complaints you will see stem from those who are playing on the 1st gen standalone players, specifically the Samsung which had a defective chip that made for soft pictures and lots of noise in the large color areas. I urge anyone looking for a Blu Ray to take a hard look at the Playstation3 as your first player, it's cheaper than the standalone units and Sound and Vision magazine gave it the highest rating of all the players available. I had previously viewed the Fifth Element on the Samsung player on a 1080 LCD and it looked like garbage. The same disk looked amazing on the PS3. <br /> <br />This movie looks amazing when played on a GOOD blu ray player. It has all the extras the DVD release has IN HD.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble has a great voice, maybe the best of his generation. No one will ever be as great as Frank Sinatra, but Buble does a great job for the present generation. He does a fantastic job on the Big Band songs, but he is even better with the Bossa Nova songs. \\"Cuando Cuando Cuando\\" is his best song, and an otherwise bland Nelly Furtado really shines on this duet. I didn't like \\"Cuando\\" when Engelbert did it as an upbeat song 30 years or so ago, but that may be because I don't much like Engelbert. Buble transforms this into a smooth Bossa Nova classic. \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" was a Big Band swing tune by Sinatra that can not be topped, and first hearing Buble's version as a slowed down song was a surprise. But on further hearing, the Bossa Nova arrangement make it a whole new song. I'd like to see an album like \\"Michael Francis Albert Buble Meets Antonio Carlos Jobim.\\"
0393312836|5.0|I admit, although I've known about this book for a long time I shied away from reading it because all mentions of it I had heard were blood, guts, and gore and nothing more but when I finally gave in and read it I was more then pleasantly surprised. Yes, this book is violent and gory but oddly enough that's only one of many distinguishing characteristics.<br /><br />The story itself weaves around page after page of strange and often catchy made up slang with a character that all at once can be hated and pitied. The smattering of scintillating imaginary slang that dance around the story doesn't take away from the often ironic and thought provoking plot. I hadn't really expected this book to make me sit back and think about morality in such a way. What IS good? And for that matter what is evil? Does a lack of evil (by force) automatically constitute good? You'll see the question by all sides and I must say the last chapter that was not published in the original American printings I think adds that final layer to the story it needed. Without it I think I would have been left feeling antsy about the entire book. In any event I do suggest this book even to those who normally shy away from 'ultraviolence.'
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I remember seeing the original Superman II in the theatres and even back then I never really cared for it. It took me a long time to fully figure out exactly what bothered me about it since there were aspects about the movie I liked a lot such as Superman fighting 3 villains with the same powers as his and Lois finding out who Superman really is. I finally came to realize the things I didn't like is the campiness, that had always bothered me, especially since Richard Donner tried so hard to make sure there was no campiness in the original Superman it made the 2 films feel very different. I also did not like the sequence with Lois in Paris with the terrorists, it dragged on too long and was boring, this also lead to how the super villains were freed from the phantom zone wich was also unimpressive. When I discovered that Richard Donner had shot most of this movie before he was fired Like everyone I wished I could have seen that version but never thought it would ever happen. Earlier this year when I found out the Richard Donner cut would be released I was happy but not overly excited because I felt it would be like every other directors cut, same movie but with added scenes wich would not help this movie.<br /><br />When it finally was released on DVD I picked it up and was very surprised how different the movie was. The opening alone made the movie feel very different from the Lester version. I also liked how the 3 villains were freed from the Phantom Zone much better. Since they were freed in the first couple of mintues of the movie this meant gone was the whole Paris sequence wich was great to see.<br /><br />Richard Donner has also put Marlon Brando back into this movie wich adds a lot more continuity between the First movie and this one. Marlon Brando should never have been cut from Superman II even to save some money, it never made sense to me to have his mother in this movie since it was Jor-El who told him who he really was and guided him. His mother was apposed to Kal El being sent to earth in the first place.<br /><br />It never really bothered me that the Lester version only had you use your imagination to how Clark got his powers back after finding the green crystal although I did always wonder how this happened. Richard Donner explains this in his cut with a sequence that is very emotional and a great moment for father and son. You realize he must get his powers back but at a great cost.<br /><br />Richard Donner also puts in John Williams score (wich is mainly recycled from the frist movie)back into this movie. John Williams musical score is MUCH better than the Ken Thorne music that was used in Lesters version. I especially noticed the difference in the opening credits and the Niagra falls sequence where Superman rescues a young kid from falling, John Williams music makes the scene feel much more tense.<br /><br />Richard Donner also cut out all the campy parts of the movie, this at first felt strange because it felt like he edited some scenes to early and I wondered why, then I remembered the sequence that followed these cuts were all campy and silly so I was glad it was done. As for the ending that a lot of people have critisized I do agree I wish another ending had been used but I do understand this was the original ending shot and Richard Donner did not want to use any more scense then necessary of Richard Lesters. Also having seen the movie I do not feel the ending is that big a deal or takes anything away from the movie, actually I like it better than some magic kiss wich makes no sense and that this saves all the damage caused during the movie.<br /><br />In conclusion I wish Richard Donner had been able to complete Superman II, if he had he would not have had to use any screen tests to tell his story (wich is a great sequence anyway screen tests or not). It would have been far superior to the campy movie that Richard Lester released.eing sent to earth in the first place.

You know how real art knows no boundaries?  That is how I feel about this band.  If you take the time and carefully listen, you will fall in love with their sound.  This DVD is excellent.
0679411585|5.0|Books come to me in some odd ways.  While walking through a small bookstore in Newark Penn Station, not necessarilly intent on buying a book, I found a copy of We Were Soldiers Once, on the bottom shelf.  Having seen the movie by Mel Gibson, I was intrigued.  Whenever possible, after visiting Hollywood for history, I always go back to the history to discover the gaps, the real interpretations, and unltimately, what really happened.<br /><br />In this case, I am very glad I picked it up off that bottom shelf.<br /><br />For anyone looking for a glamourized version of war, this is not it.  Throughout the narrative each soldier who fell is mentioned, where they were from, their kin, and how they died.  There are places where each paragraph for a number of pages references a fallen comrade.  You can't help but feel connected to those brave men, especially when you read of their hometowns... places you recognize.<br /><br />For the first major combat operation of the Vietnam War, it certainly defined the war.  And for those were thrown into La Drang, it is an experience they cannot forget.  Despite being a detailed account of the battle, with all the nuances that would make a military historian proud, I couldn't put it down.  In fact, in more than one occasion, I resented my train for arriving on schedule.<br /><br />Equally impressive was the time devoted to the Vietnamese perspective.  We conveniently think of our enemies as marching robots, but if anything, Col. Moore paints a picture of an enemy that was struggling with the difficulties of battle and the realities of the battlefield.<br /><br />If you are interested in a highly engaging battle account, especially of a battle so pivotal in the history of our involvement in Vietnam.  And if, as a background, you are intrigued with how our military strategy evolved in such a short period - from amassing troops to using air cover, this is a book you will want to read.<br /><br />Finally, if you are simply interested in learning about the men who gave the last full measure of their devotion to their fellow soldiers and their country, pick it up.  Don't let this volume sit on the bottom shelf of a bookstore.erested in learning about the men who gave the last full measure of their devotion to their fellow soldiers and their country, pick it up.

B000I5X81K|5.0|I read in a review once that if Andrea and Celine ever had a love child, it would be Josh. Like fine wine he ages very well. Each album is better than the previous. His angelic voice takes you on a journey to heavens.  <br /> <br />My money was well spent in buying \\"Awake\\"   <br />Like Oprah, I liked all the tracks on this album.  <br /> <br />He includes some romantic foreign language classics for his old fans and thankfully mixes it up with wonderful new sounds of African and contemporary piano ballads. If you like Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion you'll love Josh Groban. <br /> <br />My favorites were: <br />In Her Eyes <br />You are loved (don't give up) <br />February Song <br />Weeping <br />So she dances
B000I5X80G|4.0|Not much to add to the previous excellent reviews.It should be understood that Neil's extended angular guitar solos were very original and unique for the times.This is an excellent live performance of non overdubbed Neil young vocals and performing.Highly recommended.
0743298020|4.0|Beautiful language, fluid narration:  Setterfield's novel is a series of lyrically constructed sentences that unfold the story of Vida Winter and the biographer who unravels her deepest secret --- a tale full of sorrow, yearning for forgiveness and eventually achieving redemption.  Although at times convoluted, the sheer power of the use of the English language in an unpretentious yet impressive fashion ranks this piece as one of the satisfying reads of recent years.
B000J103N4|5.0|Not much to add the the previous excellent reviews.That said, I feel Crosby's true gift is arranging vocal harmonies as on \\"Orleans\\" and  he has a very good understanding of old school american jazz in  his composition style.The jazz doesn't show up on this cd, but to me it is akin to \\"west coast cool jazz\\" in mood, even though it's  basically  limited within the  compositional constraints of rock music.Croz rocks in his own unique style.A true American original. Highly recommended with the new remastered sound!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|While I greatly respect Al Gore's devotion and passion for the causes he believes in, the things he presents here are simply not provable in the grandest sense.  How many of us have been around for a few thousand years to see and know firsthand how factual this information truly is?  The earth has gone through many changes and will continue to do so, but the whole greenhouse effect and global warming theory is just that - theory.  Yes, you can put up factual information and I won't deny it, but that doesn't mean you mix it up with theory and come out with the end all cause and solution.   <br /> <br />It's just like those who want to blame everything that happens in the US on the President.  A president can be in office for 3 months and something dramatic happens to the economy, and suddenly everyone blames him.  Like a president could have that much effect on the entire economy in such a short period of time.   <br /> <br />I am not discouraging anyone from watching this film, but rather am saying that people need to start listening with both ears and that includes listening, reading, and watching all sides of an issue and then coming to an educated opinion/position of their own.  Quit letting others do your thinking for you and telling you what you should or should not believe.  These statements are inconvenient truths, and I hope you are open-minded enough to realize just how much they are.
0784011176|2.0|That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating! <br /> <br />On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it.
0393061434|5.0|Anyone who knows the computer world well knows the name of engineer Steve Wozniak, who in 1975 came up with the idea of blending computer circuitry with a typewriter keyboard and video screen to create the first PC. It's all well-known fact, so why an autobiography? Surprisingly, here Wozniak tells his story for the first time, examining and analyzing the influence on his inventions and blending a surprising humor into his self-assessment and life story. Any with an affection for computers will want to learn from his story.<br /><br />Diane C. Donovan<br /><br />California Bookwatch
B000GIXEIG|4.0|This was a fun film. I was drawn into the story, and I thought the characters were very believable. The fantastical scenery and great score added a lot. The acting was top-notch.    I did not appreciate Sturla Gunnarson's revisionist retelling of Beowulf. The epic tells of a hero who defeats the ultimate evil of his time. The film presents a confused, soft semi-hero who simply cannot decide whether Grendel is evil or only misunderstood. The epic describes Grendel as a \\"demon from hell\\", but the film portrays him as a misunderstood tragedy who only slaughters dozens of Danes basically because he is different and has been wronged by society. Give me a break. I think Hrothgar (in the film) accurately represents the original attitudes of the story of Beowulf. When Gerrard Butler (Beowulf) asks Hrothgar if someone had ever done something to hurt Grendel, Hrothgar explodes, \\"Oh, come on, Beowulf! It's a f------ troll - maybe somebody looked at it the wrong way!\\"    Gunnarson should have dropped the Hollywood-esque warm, fuzzy overtones and simply told the timeless story of Beowulf and Grendel.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I was hesitant at first when buying this soundtrack, but I gave in.  And I am glad I did.  It is a very soothing collection.  The scores are wonderfully composed and it fits the atmosphere of the movie wonderfully.  If you are looking for relaxing music, this is the soundtrack for you.  I find the CD soothing after a hard days work.
B000J4QWM2|4.0|I thought this was a great film through and through. Great cinematography, great soundtrack, compelling story, believable characters. It brought out strong feelings, and even though I am not familiar with the criminal underworld, I felt I could relate to the characters as people. I could really feel their inner conflicts, which I think was the entire point of the film (ad slogan - \\"No rules, No law, No order\\") <br /> <br />I never saw a single episode of the TV show. I do not hold any bitter feelings toward Mann for supposedly failing to live up to the legacy, as some have suggested. I think those folks are lost in the '70s and can't admit that Farrell and Foxx have done a fantastic job bringing Miami Vice up to the times.
B00005MP58|5.0|My aunt hates this series because she doesn't like the mother, but I believe she gives her character justice.  If I remember correctly, the mother was about the same in the book.  After watching the NEW Pride and Prejudice with Keyerra Knightley as Liz and recently watching The Special Edition, I find that I enjoy The Special Edition a little more then the most recent picture of Pride and Prejudice.  The special edition gives more detail of the characters lives and doings.  I immensely enjoyed it.  However, if you want to watch it in one sitting be sure you have a great deal of time to watch it for it is longer then the most recent Pride and Prejudice by a few hours.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|This DVD is fantastic! By far the best DVD concert I've seen. The recording its excellent in surround sound, and the Eagles, what can you say - There GREAT!!
B00004RWYJ|5.0|I have loved this movie Grease since this movie came out in I think 1978. I saw it dozens of times, and I can never get tired of it. High School Musical seems similar to it. Lots of dancing and singing.
1569242739|5.0|Superior photos, well-tested and flexible recipes makes this book a hit. I've reviewed a few of her recipes from Vegan with a Vengeance book, and all those were great too!<br /><br />Even if you're not vegan, you've got to try this!<br /><br />The only book I've seen with recipes for agave nectar as well. That in itself makes it a winner.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|What a muddled and incoherant mess!  First: Who was the leak in the FBI? The question was never answered that my husband and I could figure out.  <br />Second: We finally had to turn on the subtitles because the movie was full of incoherant mumbling dialogue. <br />Third: Are we the audience expected to believe that the main drug lord would not be mad if Gong Li's character was sleeping with another man? <br /> <br />Save your money and rent or buy something else. This one is not worth it.
0684823454|5.0|His writing is great; his stories are told in a refreshing, whimsical tone; and one gets the sense that he loves his life.  Even though I was very familiar with the event of his life before reading this, I found it thoroughly engaging and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in this extraordinary man.
B00005JNS0|3.0|Okay, unless you are an ex-pat or just plain American or you closely follow NASCAR racing, you would find this movie very entertaining.  <br /> <br />However, I'm none of those. Aren't Disney movies aimed to entertain 90% of the worlds population? Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not an anti-Disney activist but, this movie in my mind definitely did not live up to its media hype.  <br /> <br />Saw it at the theatre on the first week it was out with my easily amused significant other... hmm alright, I thought. Maybe I'll grow on me. (by the way, no one in the theatre on the opening week of a movie in the middle of New Zealands largest city at 7pm? Thats saying something)  <br /> <br />Second time I saw it, the kids who watched it with me got up and left during the first 10 minutes.. kids who usually pay attention to movies.  <br /> <br />Third time I saw it, I thought, whoa. I just don't know whats funny. <br /> <br />At first glance it has the elements of a fantastic family movie.. Owen Wilson, a great story line, awesome animation, catchy soundtrack, little off jokes to entertain the older siblings and parents... awesome!!...but the very exclusive, very American NASCAR jokes went way over my head. <br /> <br />Although, it is not Disney/Pixar's best feature film, I will give it props for creating Luigi. He is very, very cute.
B00005JPBP|4.0|The third and final stage of a magic trick is called The Prestige. This could otherwise be known as the ooh-ahh moment. Of course, for the ooh-ahh moment to be effective and fully appreciated by an audience, it must be preceded by The Pledge and The Turn - otherwise known as the build-up. <br /> <br />When this build-up to the big ooh-ahh moment is conducted over a three-minute stage performance by a professional magician and his reappearing canary or elephant, it requires a lot of skill. When this process is conducted over two hours in the form of a full-length feature film, the degree of difficulty rises significantly (special effects and multiple takes notwithstanding). <br /> <br />Given the film's complicated structure and inherent sleight-of-hand, the audience has to work hard (on a single viewing) to recognize all of the co-writer/director's considerable effort and talent - although if you do \\"watch closely\\" as you are dared, you just might disprove one of the film's apparent themes and ruin The Prestige. <br /> <br />Whilst it is not helpful to describe any pivotal details of the plot, it's obligatory to mention the extraordinary rivalry and malice that develops between the two magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Tragedy, pride and injustice can certainly produce a compelling scene or two. On a practical level, I definitely wouldn't rub a magician up the wrong way. Silly moustaches notwithstanding, magicians in 1890s London don't just get even, they get tricky. Very tricky. <br /> <br />From a casting perspective, Christian Bale is probably the film's strongest point. He apparently has a well-established cult following, but he's doubtless best known for his performance in Batman Begins. Most memorable in that role as Bruce Wayne was the unceremonious manner in which he dismissed a group of party guests. I can well imagine him making a succinct, non-annoying acceptance speech one day. <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman, under the trying circumstances of being outfitted with a top hat, limp and walking stick, does a good job too as the other energetically minded magician, Angier. More trying perhaps is that he also plays Angier's \\"body double\\", Gerald Root. Credulity can be strained when an actor plays two roles, which is a shame because Jackman is more than competent playing the drunk, terribly difficult showman, Mr Root. Perhaps this is a case of intentional distraction or misdirection? On another note, it may also have been better if Angier had been slightly more likable, certainly to begin with, as that may have heightened the audience's emotions later in the film. <br /> <br />With the greatest respect, I think it's time for Michael Caine to turn down each and every role that requires him to speak with his native cockney accent. Maybe I'm atypical in my reaction, but unfortunately, for all but a handful of scenes, I couldn't help but witness the overexposed cockney caricature Sir Michael (in place of what could have been the very interesting footsteps of the character he was playing). Of course, I've got nothing against the cockney accent per se, and maybe Caine is a victim of his own ability or popularity; but surely there's at least one other actor on the planet with gray hair, mentoring qualities and the appropriate accent. <br /> <br />Rebecca Hall, as Sarah Borden, is excellent, even though her character's extreme psychological progression happens a little too swiftly. I felt the audience needed just a couple of not-so-subtle moments to better glimpse her conundrum earlier. But again the benefit of the doubt should go with the writer/director, as overt hint-dropping here would have been very risky to The Prestige. <br /> <br />Scarlett Johansson is good and quite the temptress, though it may have been preferable to cast a less flavor-of-the-month type of actress for her role. <br /> <br />I nearly made a fool of myself by suggesting that the actor who gives a wonderful performanceas the mysterious Nikolas Tesla (despite being placed in an eerie, fog-filled, Willy Wonkaesque setting) looks a lot like David Bowie. In fact, I was convinced the resemblance was uncanny. It was all a bit distracting and amusing at the time - and more amusing still when I discovered that David Bowie actually was the actor playing the role of Nikolas Tesla. <br />   <br />Having made such a potentially credibility-impairing admission (at least for those unlikely to be charmed by self-deprecating humor), I'll soldier on and offer some parting thoughts.  <br /> <br />All in all, without mentioning plot specifics, the build-up to the ooh-ahh is very well done, but not faultless. As for the ooh-ahh itself, let others be the judge, but I reckon it would be a very harsh or incompetent viewer who didn't agree that it was worth the ticket price. <br /> <br />The Prestige is an audacious, clever, clinically crafted film, and should end up a favorite amongst the twist-and-turn crowd. It's definitely worth another look on DVD. Actually, it probably demands one. <br /> <br />For all its effort and entertainment value, I very nearly cared about the central characters. I very nearly thought the film's premise was incredibly insightful - yet which truth are we referred to? <br /> <br />I almost thought it was a great movie <br />
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh, if you are reading here-- and for others, this album is just great! <br />It is spiritual, sensitive, talented, wonderfully arranged, meaningful lyrics, moving, I could go on and on. <br /> <br />It is rare I think for music today to have an integrated presentation. <br />Beautiful voice, wonderful instrumental portions, meaningful lyrics all blend into a total experience. I personally love the new base emphasis, it provides a platform for the rest of the music. I love the way Josh even sings/articulates the words to the songs. Something personal comes out then, not just music.  This is an added bonus, that is very subtle but very powerful. I find the music on this CD very evocative of visual images. It is that good! There seems to be a enormous amount of attention paid on every single cut of this CD. There is feeling on every single song, irregardless of style. I can't remember a CD that I have loved every single song on in a long long time.  <br /> <br />Josh, I want to personally thank you for giving so much of yourself on this CD. It shows.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I found the Donner cut of Superman II quite interesting.  I watched the Lester cut first and then went to the Donner cut.  I've always found some of the Zod stuff to be too long in the Lester cut, and i was thankful that some of it was missing in the Donner.  I didn't miss the Eifel Tower scene at all, and the alternate revelation of Clark being Supe is actually quite good, even if it is a screen test.  The scenes in the Fortress of Solitude are different in places, but no less believable.   <br />BUT the 4 stars are because of the ending.  I was never wild about the ending when it was used in Supe I, but to reuse it at the end of Supe II (even if it was the original ending) makes no sense.  It reverses too much, and the famous diner scene couldn't possibly make sense.  It would be even more fun to insplice the best moments from both films and have a super SUPE II, but that won't happen.  I'm just glad to have the alternate available.
B000HBKCDC|2.0|I was very disappointed in this CD.  I am fan of Sarah McLachlan and was so excited to find that she recorded a Christmas CD.  I was completely prepared to love it.  I was sadly diappointed to find that, with the exception of 2 or 3 songs, this did not feel like a labor of love.  She has an amazing voice but instead of using it with all the passion she usually gives, it felt like she was just going through the motions.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|This movie was just not that good. I usually like just about everything that Michael Mann does. You know with Mann you are going to get really cool music, cool characters and great cinematography. But this movie just had stupid things that I just could not overcome. First Crockett and Tubbs are suppose to be infiltrating a drug cartel because there is an informant on the inside of the DEA and FBI that is tipping off the said cartel. The cartel is described as very powerful and involved in not only selling drugs but also in black market and arms dealing. It is said to be one of the most vicious and intelligent cartels and that it killed people at the drop of a hat. Soooooooooooooooooooooo Crockett and Tubbs infiltrate the cartel and when leaving the first meeting they are having with them Crockett asks the lady villian who is one of the heads of this cabal of murderers, \\"would you like to have a drink with me?\\" As they are leaving Tubbs says, \\"Sonny...\\" \\"It's ok... I know what I am doing.\\" So what does this idiot do? He goes off and has sex with her right off the bat. NOW she comes back to the cartel and her lover who is the big boss and tells him right off, \\" I slept with Burnette (Crockett) to which he says, \\"Good girl\\". So I can accept that because she is a cold calculating tramp who will do anything to manipulate for the business. Crockett, he is just a moron for sleeping with this murdering drug dealer. Sooooooooooooo then later when the head of the cartels intelligence wants to get Crockett and Tubbs killed says, \\" I have something to show you.\\" He pulls out a lap top and shows the head of the cartel Crockett and the girl... DANCING!!!! The man is so outraged he orders Crockett and Tubbs killed. Now, he doesn't care they slept together but he goes into a homicidal rage cause they danced together. MORONIC. Then and this is a SPOILER ALERT!!!!:<br /><br />In the end when they have a gun battle between the cops and the bad guys Crockett helps this drug dealing murdering woman escape, with the aid and assistance of Tubbs who sees them and turns his back. Tubbs, looking deeply into Crocketts eyes, \\"I will NEVER doubt you,\\" to Crockett was the definition of homoerotic man love. So Crockett, blinded by his 1 or 2 day sexual encounter decides that he no longer is a law enforcement officer and that this woman who was probably directly or indirectly responsible for countless murders as well as selling guns and drugs should be set free. He is the judge and jury just because he had sex with this criminal scum.<br /><br />This movie was just stupid. And Tubbs character was just like the one on the show. It was completely over shadowed by Crockett and given a token relationship and just enough of a part so he didn't look totally like a side kick/ token partner. Again, this movie was stupid. If you want to see Mann at his best check out Theif with James Caan or Collateralurdering woman escape, with the aid and assistance of Tubbs who sees them and turns his back.

0553573403|3.0|As an avid fantasy reader, I always look to expand my horizons, and for once, I bought a book based on the hype I was reading. I would place Game of Thrones most akin to Jordan's Wheel of Time series, but in direct comparison, lacking. Jordan has better characters, and his style is just more immersive. With Jordan, a huge amount of time is spent on drama fantasy not action fantasy, much like this book, but when there IS action in the Jordan books, its awesome. In Game of Thrones, its forgettable.<br /><br />In short, the strengths of this book are- good characters, and some shock value to keep you reading. Cons- weak action, and somewhat boring. Bottom line- if you want to read a long fantasy drama, try Jordan's Wheel of Time vol. 1.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|I read over halfway through the reviews and am surprised to not see the dead cameraman mentioned. My 9th grade teacher showed us this movie back in the 70's and made sure we all knew about the dead cameraman. It's a scene where the Charger slides in a turn then slams the cameraman after straightening out. It's near the start of the chase. Check it out.
B000J103YI|5.0|I think that one of the previous reviewers - Daniel Kelley, isn't looking at the new Dreams with objectionable point of view.  The original Dreamgirls debuted more than 20 years ago.  I think that if Jennifer Hudson imitated Jennifer Holiday your complaint would then be \\"She trying to be Jennifer Holiday and she ain't no Jennifer Holiday\\".  You can't compare the two, and I am glad that Hudson didn't try to imitate Holiday.  She brought her own approach to the songs she sang.  Until you judge the new `Dreamgirls' based on singing only, you'll never have an objective point of view. <br /> <br />In my personal opinion Hudson killed, her singing is awesome and she did a terrific job, I expect great things from her in the future.  The cast is well rounded and they all sound great even Eddie.  Although he wasn't my favorite, listening to the soundtrack I was left with the feeling that Eddie can actually sing.  Beyonce did an excellent job, I understand what she meant by her having to hold back,  she is not screaming through every song like she did on B'day.  Jamie is captivating in `When I First Saw You',  he sounds absolutely beautiful.  Also Anika Noni Rose was a delight to listen to,  even though most people don't know her because she is a theater performer.  All in all the soundtrack to the new Dreamgirls film is very well rounded and there were great stand out performances from Jennifer Hudson.   <br /> <br />Best songs: <br />Move 5/5 <br />Love You I Do 5/5 <br />Dreamgirls 5/5 <br />It's All Over 5/5 <br />And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going 5/5 <br />When I First Saw You 5/5 <br />One Night Only (Hudson) 5/5 <br />Listen 5/5 <br />Hard to Say Goodbye 4/5
0440418569|3.0|\\"The amber spyglass\\" is the third and last book in Phillip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" triology. It is good, but not nearly as engaging as the previous two books in the series, \\"Northern lights\\" (or \\"The golden compass\\", the name given to that book in USA) and \\"The subtle knife\\". I must say that I didn't love \\"The amber spyglass\\", but I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />The books in \\"His Dark Materials\\" are the kind of books that make you happy someone taught you how to read. They are full of magic, interesting characters and weird events. In a nutshell, they make you dream, and awake your imagination, whether you are extremely young or already an adult.<br /><br />From my point of view, that is extremely important, and that is the reason why I recommend \\"The amber spyglass\\" to you, even though I only give it 3 stars. Truth to be told, the real value of this book is not to be found as a standalone, but rather as the conclusion of an outstanding triology that is already a classic. Recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000002KKX|5.0|I know this album has been called everything under he sun.  From great Pop to utter sappy trash.  This review won't mean much to most people, but it goes to the heart of what music is about.  First of all, I think this can be called a classic POP album.  Aside from the songs everyone knows like \\"Sailing\\" and \\"Ride Like The Wind\\", the album contains very well written songs with great harmony like \\"Poor Shirley\\", \\"Spinning\\", and \\"Minstrel Gigilo\\".  It also contains some pretty nice guitar playing by Chris, Larry Carlton, and Eric Johnson.  All that being said, the album has a special place in my heart for its ability to simply take me back in time.  It was the summer of my Freshman year of high school and this album was the hottest thing going.  When I hear these songs, I literally feel 14 again.  The summer nights driving my 10 speed to my girlfriends house on a beautiful summer night in (what was then) wonderful Colorado Springs, never thinking much past tomorrow.  This album on a cassette walkman was with me everywhere.  I hear these songs and get a little tickle deep down. For a few minutes or even a few seconds I am 14 again on that 10 speed.  The feelings and images are still so vivid, for those few minutes I am back in that wonderful time that was oh too short.  I moved away that fall and the innocence of that summer would be forever lost.  But the music on this album will stay with me as a reminder of that point in time.  It is a wonderful album, and as I said this is no doubt no help at all to anyone wanting to buy this CD.  But it speaks to the power of great music, so if you are in your late 30's, give it a listen.  Maybe it will spark some memories in you as well.  It never gets far from my CD player, even though the memories it invokes get further from me every day.
0385335482|4.0|I must admit that I've owned this book for almost a year and couldn't complete it. I was kind of over the whole \\"chick lit\\" trend. I'd been sick of reading about magazines, fashion, coffee, city apartments, etc. but Kinsella did something that no other chick lit writer has done for me---she had me LMAO literally on the train! About 50 pages into it, Rebecca Bloomwood became my heroine. We ALL suffer from addictions and bad habits...but somehow with this novel, tbey become slightly funny...then irritating...and I have to say that I finished this novel with the motivation to clear up my debts and live a stress-free and fun life.  <br /> <br />I can't really say anything that has already been said...but I'd recommend it to my girls. you will walk away from this novel believing that there is nothing you can't accomplish as long as you just FACE YOUR CHALLENGES headstrong.  <br /> <br />P.S. and even though I said I'm through with chick lit, I just may continue the series when I get the urge. in fact...I WILL be continuing the series! <br /> <br />
0553106635|5.0|I was blown away by the first two volumes in this series and I approached the third with fear and trembling, wondering if it would live up to the precedent set and if so, which of my favorite characters may finish the book dead. <br /> <br />On both counts I was not disappointed.  No filler here.  GRRM continues his story in full-throttle with even more plot twists and shocking turns than the first two novels.  The story remains character-centric and what I love about it is the way the author expertly molds the clay of their personalities and actually manages to change my opinion of characters over time.  Some of those I would have pinned for the most heinous in books one and two begin to show some redeeming qualities that are only countered by the \\"good guys\\" revealing their own demons within.   <br /> <br />In true ASOIAF form, no character is safe, regardless of galantry and \\"heroism\\" and some of those who don't make it to book four alive will undoubtedly prove to have been a favorite or two.  That said, this is what makes this series so wonderful: the suspense is real.  The question isn't \\"how is this character going to get himself out of this?\\", it's, \\"IS this character going to get out of this?\\".  And often the question doesn't even have the time to be asked as a tragedy befalls a character like lightning from a clear-blue sky (which happens more than once in this volume). <br /> <br />I've said it in my reviews of the first two, but it bears repeating: if you are looking for formulaic fantasy with all the usual suspects and archetypes, this one's probably not your bag.  That said, this series is in my opinion, unequivocally the best series epic ever written, and by ever, I mean ever.  You may not line up with me on that point, but as they say, if you shoot for the moon and miss, at least you land among the stars.   <br /> <br />Don't miss this one.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I am a big fan of all the Final Fantasy series.  I like this movie.  I enjoyed watching it and liked the fact that it had a English version unlike the earlier copy of the DVD.  If your a fan of Final Fantasy VII you will like this movie.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Is Al Gore upset with global warming or the fact that he lost the 2000 election campaign. Al Gore could have produced a genuine movie about global warming, but he commonly misstates facts throughout the movie, all the while of trying to raise emotions by showing the 2000 election, pictures and stories of his family, and the Gore ranch. He really dropped the ball on his global warming message by clouding the message with such nonsense. My question to Gore is, is he testing the temperatures of the ocean or the current political climate for a possible run in 08? <br /> <br />Global warming is a natural process, and if you want to read sound information about global warming, see Peter Wards article in the October 2006 Scientific American. It will be an hour of your life better spent.
B0009W5JS2|4.0|If you're expecting some big, deep, meaningful morality tale in \\"XXX: State Of The Union\\", look elsewhere. This movie doesn't pretend to be a deep psychological political thriller, like the 1962 version of \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" was; it's a fast-paced action flick, and it makes no bones about it.<br /><br />Rapper/actor Ice Cube is Darius Stone, a Navy Seal who was wrongly imprisoned when he fought a order from his commanding officer to kill innocent people in Kosovo. Stone's former C.O. is now the Secretary Of Defense, and he's got some plans for the nation which aren't too pleasant.<br /><br />Once again, we have Samuel L. Jackson reprisiing his role as NSA Senior Agent Gibbons, the man who enables Stone to escape from prison after a team of masked (and heavily armed) men stage a raid on Gibbons's NSA headquarters in which several agents are killed. This isn't gonna sit too well with Gibbons, so he wants to know what's going on; hence the need for Stone to do the investigating, and do a bit of butt-kicking along the way.<br /><br />Needless to say ... a lot of action, including some pretty good stunt work, is packed into the space of 101 minutes, and director Lee Tamahori, who's no stranger to the action movie genre (he directed \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"Along Came A Spider\\" -- two other films which fit the \\"popcorn action movie\\" genre), and he does a pretty good job of keeping the movie going, even though the plot itself has holes which are big enough to fly a fleet of Blackhawks through.<br /><br />It's also good to see some familiar faces in this movie, including Willem Dafoe as the Secretary of Defense, Scott Speedman (who's definitely come a long way from his days on the TV series \\"Felicity\\") as the NSA agent who always seems to be at least one step behind Stone, and rapper Xzibit turns in a good performance as Zeke, the chop-shop owner who's recruited into the fight to save the nation.<br /><br />While \\"XXX: State Of The Union\\" isn't the world's greatest movie, the DVD has enough goodies to keep you interested, and it's a good companion to the unrated director's cut version of \\"XXX\\".<br /><br />All in all, if you want a movie that's perfect to munch popcorn by, \\"XXX: State Of The Union\\" is your kind of movie.you interested, and it's a good companion to the unrated director's cut version of \\"XXX\\".

B000002LEU|5.0|On this CD, Joy Division and Martin Hannett offer a mixture of rock-punk because it's more rock than punk with tracks like \\"Failures\\", \\"No Love Lost\\", \\"Leaders of men\\" and \\"Warsaw\\". It also includes more experimental digital sounds with \\"Transmission\\" and \\"Digital\\". Also, the song they're most known for, \\"Love will tear us apart\\". The sounds and lyrical content are very modern although dark, this record is timeless! It's for music lovers!
B000060OFT|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS, WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.  I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE THE BEST MOVIE THAT I HAD EVER SEEN.  I WAS ACTUALLY READING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THIS FILM WAS RELEASED AND WENT AND SAW IT FOR EXTRA CREDIT.  I WAS SO BLOWN AWAY FROM THE CAST, THE DIRECTING, THE PHOTOGRAPHY, AND THE MUSIC.  IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS EVER.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE GRABBED ME.  THE SHAKESPEREAN DIALOGUE IN MODERN TIMES WAS DONE VERY NICELY.  THE ACTING WAS ALSO NOTHING SHY OF GREATNESS. CLAIRE DANES NAILED JULIET AND LEO BROUGHT OUT THE AGONY A YOUNG MAN GOES THROUGH WHEN IN LOVE THROUGH HIS DISPLAY OF EXTREME EMOTIONS, PREACHINESS OF HIS PASSION, AND THE IMPULSIVNESS OF HIS ACTIONS.   <br />IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE, PLEASE GIVE IT A SHOT.  THERE IS NO MOVIE OUT THERE LIKE IT.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|While my husband finds Sarah's McLachlan's voice beautiful yet \\"depressing\\", I find her naturally ethereal and haunting voice to add a sacredness to these Christmas songs that is often neglected in the wake of the boisterousness and frivolity of the season. It is music to reflect by and will impress you with a sense of the deeper spirituality of the season and perhaps even illuminate the beauty of winter.
B00005JLXE|5.0|THIS COMIC BOOK MOVIE RAISES THE BAR FOR ALL OTHERS.  DAREDEVIL WAS NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITE HEROES UNTIL I SAW THIS MOVIE.  AND I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, I'M NOT PART OF THE WHOLE BASH BEN AFLECK BAND WAGON, HE WAS CAST PERFECTLY AS DAREDEVIL/MATT MURDOCK.  I'VE YET TO THINK OF ANYONE WHO COULD'VE DONE IT BETTER.  STORY WAS GREAT, MUSIC ONLY ENHANCED THE ENJOYMENT OF THE MOVIE, AND CINEMAPHOTOGRAPHY WAS REALLY WELL DONE.  I LOVED THE IMAGERY OF HIS MASK SITTIG IN A PUDDLE OF WATER, BLOOD, AND ROSE PETALS.  THIS MOVIE WAS TOUGH, DARK, ROMANTIC, AND HAD VERY LITTLE CAMPY HUMOR, WHICH I DON'T LIKE IN A LOT OF COMIC BOOK MOVIES.  I ENJOY THIS MOVIE ON MANY LEVELS AND GIVE IT A HIGH RECCOMENDATION.  GO SEE IT.
B000IY042C|5.0|first of all rammstein is one of the best metal band left, i got the especial edition that has a bonus dvd and one audio cd, i got it from a mexico on line store, for about 26 usd and also i got for free a rammstein t-shir to my suprise, but the big one came when i put the dvd on, the performance and the piro are incredible, probable this kind of show will never be performe in north or south america do to our safety standars you just have to buy it and see it for yous self, in my opinion the version whit the book is over rated, if you have a bit of computer knowledge and some spare time you can probably rip the audio from the dvd i create your own full concer cd's and the book is not that much of a big deal, any way people try to get it before ebayers try to scam you for 3 times the price
B0009P42S2|4.0|I just watched this, and I must say it was very well done.  It has great characters and good action.  But, this is not very, oh, how should I put this, \\"anime-ish.\\"  At least, it doesn't feel like it to me.  However, this is still a great movie that a fair amount of people will enjoy.  I'd say rent it first.  (BTW, first \\"anime\\" feature film for me.....I crave more!!!)
B00005AAFS|5.0|Never have I been so surprised, impressed and moved by such an album. When I bought this, i had no idea it was going to be the greatest albums I ever bought, and a turning point in my life. After just one listen of this album, I declared Rammstein my favourite band ever. They are just magnificent. Every tone, riff, beat, word and what else these geniuses of music decide to craft in are done in such purpose, it really makes each song a joy to listen to. <br /> <br />The album starts off with slow, depressing violin sounds that magically and immediately breaks into drums and guitar, along with harsh, sudden violins. This is Mein Herz Brennt, one of the best openers in a an album I've ever heard. I seems unlikely that such a beautiful song could be beaten, but it does. The third song \\"Sonne\\" is definitely my favourite song on the album. It mixes hard-hitting drums and guitar with soft, eerie singing, surprisingly done with a keyboard. The album goes back to rock with \\"Ich Will\\" and Freuer Frei\\", which are two great songs to headbang to and include awesome techno sounds (reliving Rammstein's earlier albums). The album slows down again for \\"Mutter\\" which sounds so simple, yet orchestral. Then the album speeds up again with \\"Speilhurh\\", \\"Zwitter\\", the Sonne anthem \\"Rein, Raus\\" and \\"Adios\\", which boasts a superb, fast guitar solo. The album's slowest song is \\"Nebel\\", which is a trend for new-age Rammstein to end their albums on the slowest song. Nebel is beautiful, slow, and easy listening. <br /> <br />Don't think that this is Rammstein's one-hit wonder album. All their albums are great and if your into intellectual rock or some heavy metal to air-guitar to, Rammstein's got you set. It's been two and a half years since I bought Sonne and I still listen to it and Rammstein still remains my favourite band.
B000683VI4|4.0|OMG - What a truly wonderful heartwarming romance movie!! I have to rate \\"The Notebook\\" right up there among my all time favorites including \\"Titanic\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (story of Patsy Cline), \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\", and \\"Pretty Woman\\"!  <br />I've watched this movie over a dozen times, and even though I own the DVD, I continue to watch it every time it appears on TV! I just can't seem to get enough of watching this movie, and enjoy it each time - just as much as I did the first time I saw it!! <br />A superior cast, comprised of some of my favorite actors, really shine in bringing this beautiful heartwarming love story to life! Rachel McAdams is an absolute doll and just sparkles in her role as beautiful, charming, sophisticated, bubbly, energetic, full of life - young Allie. I've always admired and enjoyed Gena Rowlands in her past movie roles, and believe this role as Allie, in present day time, is among one of her best roles, yet! <br />Movie veteran, James Garner, is a delight as present day Noah, and as for young Noah, portrayed by Ryan Gosling - Hey, what can I say except -  <br />OMG, what a cutie!! No wonder Allie fell head-over-heels in love with him - right along with every other female on the planet that has ever seen this movie! Lol <br />All in all, it is definitly a \\"must-have\\" to add to your romance movie collection! <br /> <br />
0553212478|5.0|If you haven't seen gimmicky Frankenstein paraphanelia strewn about every grocery store in sight then you've been living under a rock.  Nearly everyone living in the western world is familiar with this story, at least in a Halloween movie, lame costume sort of way.  Yet behind the commercial gimmicks is a genuinely human and insightful story.  Ever since I've read the book(and I've read it several times) Frankenstein has kept its spot one of my favorite books of all time.<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock: a gifted Swiss doctor named Victor Frankenstein creates a creature from corpses, hoping to prove that he can give life to dead matter.  He succeeds in giving it the spark of life but is horrified when the thing(which is never named), awakes and reaches out for him like a child reaching out for its father.  Frankenstein abandons the creature and flees, leaving the creature to its own devices.  The resulting storyline follows the creature's desire for revenge on his creator, and Frankenstein's attempts to atone for what he's done.  The creature, ridiculed for its horrific appearance, exacts revenge by slowly murdering those that Frankenstein holds dear.<br /><br />I started Frankenstein expecting a difficult read and was surprised by the ease of the passages.  For a book written almost two hundred years ago this book is surprisingly easy to understand for the modern reader. Like Dumas's writing, the focus is on the admittedly awesome story, not the intricacies of the writing itself(though these are definitely there, they flow into your mind at an almost subconscious level).<br /><br />The sheer breadth of the issues it brings up merit reading it.  Issues surrounding human hubris, the role of man as creator, and the appropriateness of man using science to play as God.  That's only a short list.  But thought-provoking themes aside, this is a good book.  The strength of Shelley's prose lies in her characterization of the monster; though you see the havoc it wreaks, you cannot help but feel a sort of aching pity for the thing.  She presents the struggle between Frankenstein and his creation as a genuine moral dilemma, handling each side with genuine sympathy.  If you get this book, I hope you'll like it as much as I have.see the havoc it wreaks, you cannot help but feel a sort of aching pity for the thing.

B000H305U0|5.0|Opinions of this album seem to be either on one end of the spectrum or the other. I am pleasntly surprised with the versatile production on this album considering it was predominantly produced by Timbaland. Timbaland has definitry shown that he has range. Justin Timberlake has shown that he can go fro a track like \\"sexy back\\" to a song like \\"Until the end of Time\\" he shows growth and he is really taking a risk in trying to mix his style and he has done a good job thus far. If you are looking for that bubble gum pop&B stuff he did with N' Sync this CD is not for you.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Bob Dylan is one of, if not the most, influential artists in the history of popular music.  Almost every great band covers one of his songs.  He has changed the face of folk, rock, blues, and pretty much any style one could think of. <br /> <br />This album, however, is nothing special.  When it came out, Rolling Stone gave it 5 stars and everyone made it seem like he'd done it again.  But to tell you the truth, he hasn't.  Every single song in here can be traced back to someone else.  Although blues tends to be that way already, he still doesn't have anything completely original.  For example, I listen to the first track \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\", and I find myself humming \\"Rock and Roll\\" from Led Zeppelin.  I realized that the drumming is pretty much the same with similar guitar work.  Then I saw the track \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\".  Led Zeppelin's done that one before along with tons of other musicians.  \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" is just another cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\".  (Note: I realize he credits himself with writing all the music when in fact I say it's been done before.  Led Zeppelin did the same thing, where they took most of the music and made it their own without crediting the original artist.) <br /> <br />Overall, the album is solid and has that classic Bob Dylan sound.  It does drag at times, but he has some great stuff in here.  Buy this album, but don't think that it is in anyway revolutionary.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|LET IT BE - NAKED is a totally unnecessary album. The additional disc of studio chatter is a massive bore-- please don't waste a portion of your life listening to it.<br /><br />The original album, in spite of a few Spector overdubbed tracks, is just fine and about all one needs to hear from this ill-fated movie and concert project.<br /><br />Speaking of which, if Apple really cares about Beatles fans young and old (which I doubt), they should re-release the film of LET IT BE-- give it a short theatrical run, then follow that up with a home video product. LET IT BE is certainly not the greatest rock movie of all time, but it has a few fine moments. This movie is the REAL Let It Be Naked.
B000HT386M|4.0|Sure, Adam Sandler's roles sometimes are sterotypical and predictable.  But, aren't many actors labeled to a certain kind of role? This is a movie that definintely has \\"popcorn\\" written all over it, but it is fun and the ideas, although borrowed to a certain degree, make one think about life.          Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, an overworked architect who must choose between striving for a promotion at his job or pleasing his family. There are times when he tries to please everyone, including his boss (played by David Hasselhoff), but he seemingly cannot find a way to control what direction his life is going in. One night, he happens to be looking for a universal remote, and winds up getting a universal remote--for his life.          Although there is the typical bathroom humor and crudeness you might expect from an Adam Sandler film, the bottom line that this is a movie that is funny, has a heart and has a message: don't let other goals interfere with family. Newman, after learning how to use the remote successfully, realizes eventually that there are many hazards as well. He misses critical junctures in his family's life, one of the most painful is the passing of his father. He feels this sadness, and in realizing that having that much control can be detrimental, he overcomes many of his own character pitfalls.          This film seems to question the overworked parent who doesn't have time to spend with his or her family, and makes a point about the degree of importance we should attach to our own personal goals in life. As Sandler's character figures out, they don't add up to much, when compared to the bigger picture in life.          The concept of the film has been seen and done before. We saw this before in the classic \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" However, films' ideas are constantly being \\"borrowed,\\" and this is nothing new here. Overall, this film is a bit crude at times, but a fun movie that will have you laughing as well and, more importantly, make you think about what things you take for granted in your own life.
B000J103X4|5.0|Now that I've had plenty of time to listen to this album since I copped it the first day it came out, I am overall pleased with this album. I was kind of afraid that the album was going to be a little disappointing without Dre in the mix, but Jason definitely stepped up. <br /> <br />The way you know that an album is good is when you put the CD in, you don't have to hit the next button because you don't have to. Every track is full of raw emotion, yet artistically provocative. His uncanny ability to spit from his gut is kind of freighting and yet exciting, because honestly, there hasn't really been a rapper in a while who makes us not afraid to be ourselves and he makes it clear that he's here to stay no matter what.  <br /> <br />Doctor's Advocate did have some tracks I could care less for like \\"Around the World\\", but that's it. That is the only track that I can honestly say I don't really listen to.  <br /> <br />Overall I gave this album five stars instead of four is because after all the drama with 50 and the falling out of Aftermath ( if I need to explain what happened before Doctor's Advocate dropped, then you've been living in a cave ) he was able to pull out this album that has changed my perspective on Hip Hop once again. The only albums that have ever done this to me were Nas - Illmatic and Eminem - Marshall Mathers LP. Yea, it's that good.

B00008O89K|5.0|As other reviewers have noted, this is a truly great soundtrack. Yes, its completely over-the-top, but nobody could listen to the first few tracks and think, \\"How boring.\\" As the music swells in the opening credits music, the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, and they never go back down until the CD has finished! <br /> <br />If you liked this movie, or you are a fan of the fantasy genre, then you will certainly like this CD. Glorious, tacky, over-the-top fun.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|`The Black Parade' is the third album by Jersey band My Chemical Romance. While most of you are aware of what it is about, let me provide a brief overview for those who may not: It's a song cycle about cancer, death and liberation.<br /><br />Please! Do not be turned off by the topic. It is not as sordid and ugly as the adultery and child molestation in `Tommy' to name one other in this genre. In fact, I am going to state my firm conviction that - while likely to appeal to a more narrow audience - this visionary, incandescent work is so full of strength, determination, commitment and heart-felt joy that folks should be prepared to buy two so that a replacement is available when the first wears out!<br /><br />About eight years ago, a coworker was diagnosed with a particularly rapid form of breast cancer. Upon receiving her diagnosis, she immediately scheduled radical mastectomy surgery and a rigorous chemo regimen. There were many days she could not make it to the office. On the days she did, she often could be found on the floor exhausted. Five years later, my wife and I attended her anniversary of being cancer free.<br /><br />In May of last year, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Upon receiving my diagnosis, I asked myself, \\"What would X do?\\" and, knowing the answer, scheduled my surgery.<br /><br />The two of us met about ten months ago at a different place of employment. As we shared our mutual stories, I realized that we were engaged in a rarified conversation in which both of us had arrived at a place that could only be reached by traveling a route that was difficult and deadly. The joy we both felt foe ourselves and each other was borne of that trip.<br /><br />I tell you this because `The Black Parade' will provide you with a near-approximation of what we felt that day. This 14 song album explores each and every nuance of what one faces and goes through when one's life is at peril. And, even more so, it describes in beautifully exquisite sound and lyrics that emotional roller-coaster and the rush of shooting off into the rapture of peace with oneself.<br /><br />In a standard review, I'd be addressing the individual tracks at this point. I'm not going to do that because the beauty and nature of this work both allows and requires that it be taken as a single entity that is everything and nothing at once. The aural texture this work is like an ongoing set of rapids. The music and concepts swirl and interact with each other remaining part of a larger consistent and glorious whole.<br /><br />Few bands would try this sort of music; fewer would succeed.<br /><br />First, a band must be metal-influenced to do this. As I've gotten older (and maybe wiser), I have come to see, realize and respect the cold honesty of metal. It has a purity of purpose and direction that result in candor.<br /><br />Second, you have got to be talented and visonary; make no mistake about it, MCR has ample amounts of both. The progression across the band's three albums is amazing.<br /><br />So, buy this album and listen to it over and over. It will become part of your action plan for the rest of your life!rush of shooting off into the rapture of peace with oneself.

B000AYEL1A|5.0|When they talk about on screen chemistry, this is the film that sets that standard! Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson are SENSATIONAL Together in A Star is Born! hard to believe that it was Elvis who was originally going to do this film! This Film is by far the best of the Star is Born Films! Barbra Streisand is at her peak as both an Actress and Singer in this film! This is the Film in which I first fell in Love with Barbra, I was only 13 years old when I saw this Film and When I saw Barbra on Screen, I realised I was Witnessing the Greatest Entertainer in History! The DVD Extras are Great , with an Extra 16 minutes of Deleted Scenes, never before scene and the Wardrobe Test are a Rare Treat! What I love Most  of all is the Commentary by Barbra! It is great to hear here take on the film that is 30 years old(hard to believe)! If you havent seen this Film, please do, you are in for a Treat!
B000001GY9|5.0|These living recordings not only find Bernstein in total shape but still more in what it could be stated as a wisdom state. To my view, since 1971, the year in which Leonard decided to consider the possibility to choose Europe as his next stage and the definitive one, he acquired a renovated vision, and even a major stature as conductor. You may realize how his Mahler cycle, his musical thinking improved to unexpected levels.<br /><br />In what Schumann concerns, few directors like him understood so well the artistic heritage and the tragedy beneath the score, because the Romanticism spirit was just the peak of the iceberg. The spring Symphony' s reading  for instance, is sturdy, vivid and expansive. The Vienna Philharmonic with its wonderful, exultant, vigorous and penetrating sonorous density made the perfect ensemble. Maybe the Third movement is quite reflexive; I would have preferred a major intensity at the beginning of the movement but these are minor subtleties.  This version may be labeled as one the seven supreme ones ever made until this date. If you consider Munch, Koussevitzsky, Fricsay,  Paray, Sawalich  Kubelik, yopu should not worry about it.<br /><br />Bernstein reached an insurmountable peak when he decided to record the second symphony with the New York Philharmonic. This version is good but less idiomatic than the previous one. The Third Symphony has been a matter of discussion and admiration; its bucolic and Pastoral character makes of this sublime Symphony a real stone in the shoe for many directors incapable to decipher the minimum facets of this Op. Bernstein makes a sumptuous and refined reading but to my view his previous version with the NYC is notably superior.<br /><br />The Fourth is notable too, with reflexive passages, beating introspectiveness and above all, the visible Mahlerian approach employed by Bernstein to underline the close affinity among both composers. This version, plus Paray, Abendrtoth, Rafael Kubelik, Furtwangler and Sawalich are the most representative versions I have listened until this date.<br /><br />In sum this set is indispensable for all sort of listeners who will be able to understand why Leonard was considered a status conductor and a magnificent director during the past Century.t representative versions I have listened until this date.

B000002I99|5.0|A new era starts for Alice.  Gone is the original band as Alice goes solo teaming up once again with producer Bob Ezrin and new co-writer guitarist Dick Wagner to create Alice's vision of grand rock theater.  \\"Nightmare\\" is considered a classic by most Cooper fans and indeed it is a great album albeit different from what his fans at the time might have been used to.  The album is a concept piece revolving around the main character \\"Steven\\" (who is really Alice) sleeping through a nightmare...........or is it real?  This album was conceived and written for the stage as Alice took a full theatrical production of this work on the road.  Part rock, theater, Broadway, ballads, and even jazzy at times \\"Nightmare\\" covers a lot of ground.  Several huge hits came from this album and they are all good ones.  The title track with its horn section blaring out the main theme is very different from anything The Alice Cooper Band ever did.  \\"Only Women Bleed\\" was Alice's first hit ballad.  \\"Department Of Youth\\" was another big one that although a great song, does not really fit in the context of the album concept.  The album tracks are mostly strong as well with \\"Devils Food / The Black Widow\\" still playing a part in Alice's set today.  Vincent Price's creepy narration during \\"Black Widow\\" is a bit corny, but I get the feeling that is the way Alice wanted it to be.  \\"Cold Ethyl\\" is similar to \\"I Love The Dead\\" from the previous album, only this one is totally done as a black comedy.  The album closes with four songs that run together \\"Years Ago\\", \\"Steven\\", \\"The Awakening\\" , and \\"Escape\\" telling the story of Steven (Alice) and some of his mental.......lets say issues.  The Steven character would show up on several later Cooper albums as well.  For fans of progressive rock Tony Levin (King Crimson, ABWH, Peter Gabriel) played bass on this one.  Although this album was a big departure from the original band's material it stands on it's own as a great piece of work.
0060161582|2.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed several other books by Bill Bryson, but this one has to be considered a sad disappointment. Virtually all of it comes off sounding vicious and mean-spirited, in spite of the author's intention of being humorous.   He travels across America in his mother's Chevette (doing damage to it and never exhibiting any sign of remorse), eats at dumpy, greasy diners so as to have plenty of bad food to complain about, stays at roach motels in order to whine about the lousy accommodations, gripes about the dumpiness of poor, small towns in the U.S. and then has the unmitigated gall to say that Lady Bird Johnson's campaign to remove ugly billboards from the interstate highway system was a colossal mistake. Yeah, Bill, your appreciation for the beauty of billboards shows what an eye for culture you've got.   He spends fifteen seconds passing through some small town and has the amazing ability to know exactly how everyone there wastes their lives. Whatever tiny sliver of some state he sees is somehow, to him, indicative of the entire state. And if he meets one person in a town that he isn't impressed with, it means that every single person in that state is somehow ugly, uneducated and overweight. Oddly enough, if he happens to encounter somebody who is well-educated, that doen't mean that everyone else is, too. No sweeping generalizations allowed if it would mean that something was good rather than bad. And his repetitious negative comments about the weight of everybody he encounters get awfully tiresome. That appears to be the absolutely, positively most important thing about all Americans in Mr. Bryson's eyes.  This entire book sounds patronizing and so, so smugly superior. Mr. Bryson probably pats himself on the back at frequent intervals for being so much smarter, wittier, better educated than anyone else in the entire nation. And the meanest remarks he seems to reserve for his own parents, who must have been more than glad to see him take off for Europe.
B000006XSD|3.0|\\"Lace And Whisky\\" is a complete left turn for Alice.  He cut his hair, assumed a 40's era gangster persona, and left the horror \\"shock rock\\" behind him.  Cooper once again teams up with Ezrin, Wagner, Hunter, and Levin, but comes up with a very different album.  This is not really a concept piece but the main thrust of the album seems to deal with the Alice's admission of his now well documented problems with alcohol and excess in general.   Alice's album sales were beginning a real decline by this time, and even though the album sported the top 10 ballad \\"You And Me\\" it sold significantly less than it's predecessors.  The album is all over the place.  Alice actually does some of his hardest rock material with songs like \\"It's Hot Tonight\\", \\"Damned If You Do\\", and especially \\"Road Rats\\" (supposedly the inspiration for the movie \\"Roadie\\").  None of these are great Cooper tunes, but they do have an energy that makes them fun to listen to.  The album also contains the humorous \\"King Of The Silver Screen\\" a song about a transvestite construction worker who dreams of being a movie star (only Alice could think this up).  There is some throwaway filler here as well such as his cover of \\"Ubangi Stomp\\", and the disco laden  \\"Love At Your Convenience\\".  On the other hand the two songs that deal with his alcohol problems \\"Lace And Whisky\\" and especially the excellent \\"I Never Wrote Those Songs\\" are both strong with heartfelt poignant lyrics.  Anyone who has ever gone on a drinking binge and not been able to remember what they did the night before can relate to this one.  The album closer sees the first inclusion of Alice's conversion to Christianity in his lyrics with the organ filled \\"My God\\".  I am not exactly sure at what point this happened but the subject would find its way more and more into Alice's work over the next 3 decades.  It is a cool way to end the album and works well both musically and lyrically.  \\"Lace And Whisky\\" is not an essential Alice Cooper album and isusually regarded as one of his lesser releases by fans.   I think it is worth owning, but it is a very average release for the Coop.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|I saw the movie at the theater without ever having read any of O'Brian's books, and was overpowered by the realism, power, and beauty of the movie.  Inspired by the film, I've since read the first two volumes of the series, and plan on reading them all.  I purchased the DVD and each subsequent viewing has demonstrated that the creators of the film brought a true and loving adaptation of the books to the screen.  It's wonderfully directed and acted, and the screenplay does justice to the vernacular of the period.  The cinematography is incredible, the battle and sailing sequences being as realistic as can be imagined. The gore is restrained, much being inferred rather than easy in your face approach usually taken these days. The soundtrack is exceptional, and the violin\cello duets utilized to illustrate the camaraderie between Aubrey and Maturin demonstrate the keen interest in culture and knowledge that are such an important aspect of these two characters.  Character development is masterfully done, and anyone with a pulse will find entertainment, humor, warmth, and inspiration from this movie.  It's one of my favorites.

1594200440|3.0|Three and a half stars!<br /><br />Whilst certainly amusing at times (images of the **** car spring to mind) I wouldn't have described it as 'uproariously funny' like one review on the back cover said.<br /><br />It was an interesting observation of people and their needs and how we can view things from a different perspective if we care to bother. The 'old fool' or the lonely old man?<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters; the sisters, Vera and Nadezhda and their rivalry, the greedy Valentina and Nikolai, the father. I felt his relationship with his daughters and his mind changing regarding Valentina typified an elderly man who just wanted someone to love and care for him.
B000ICM5W6|2.0|Ang Lee really gave me ANGst. The first half is horrible, lots of Islam-sounding music and brooding of Banner and a story that barely moves. VERY difficult to sit through this. Once the Hulk goes on a rampage, it certainly gets better but the CGI is OK-to-Good and not superb as we expect in today's world.<br /><br />It's too bad they got Ang Lee as he almost ruined Stan Lee's creation.<br /><br />I wish a Marvel character had been respected better by a director. Hulk and Marvel fans MUST own this just because, but it won't be your favorite. Even the mediocre (given today's expectations we all have) TV series with Bill Bixby (who was wonderful as Banner) has FAR more heart and soul than much of the first half of this one.

B0002DB52M|5.0|There are some interesting comments on this movie that I can't top. I'll just say whoever can't see the movie as a movie and rather as a criticism of Americans, is not using the full potential of their brains. You people one day will learn not everything is about you. Hardly anything, but the criticism to your selfishness and that deep black hole that's your called \\"american dream\\", is about you.    The first time I tried to watch it, I noticed it was so different from anything else that I just couldn't finish it. Six months later, I decided to literally suffer it, but at least have the experience of finishing watching. At the end I understood everything. It's a deep search within ourselves, a deep look at what we can become, what lies beneath every mask we as human beings (and I'll include americans on this) put on.    If you are an american who thinks a movie has to spend millions to be good, has to be all smiles and lies and cover-ups, has to illustrate (once again and foreeeeeeeeever) your \\"american dream\\", if you think Nicole Kidman ever really acted on another film (except, maybe, in The hours), if your only concern is to look for criticism because of your way of live, if you feel threatened easily and scared about EVERYTHING (most americans do), please don't watch this movie. You will hate it. But you know, that's a way to recognize art... You can love it, or hate it. You just can't be neutral about it.     That said I conclude with the obvious: this movie is the epitome of art.  And yes, I'm te real voice of truth, so don't get caught by those others reviewers who can't see beyond their noses.    Enjoy the movie!!
0316779237|5.0|Holidays on Ice may be David Sedaris' finest collection.  The humor here is concentrated by its theme and diverse in terms of point of view and varying shades of dark humor.  I certainly enjoyed the rest of Sedaris' works, but I think having a general theme guides his essays the best.  Me Talk Pretty One has a guiding topic, and Sedaris works hard to tackle it from his American childhood to his French adulthood. <br /> <br />But like Me Talk Pretty One Day, most of Sedaris' works trap the reader in both his mind and his body.  I get bored with looking at the world from the perspective of David Sedaris, the man and author.  This does not happen in Holidays on Ice.  Instead, Sedaris channels his witty weirdness and gives the reader variety that is not generally available in his other collections.  Maybe it's the precise choice of stories behind the success of Holidays on Ice.  Perhaps Sedaris' other works would be more successful if they were more balanced. <br /> <br />Thus, I find Holidays on Ice to be Sedaris' best collection due to the concentration of theme, the variable points of view and perspectives shaping the essays/stories, the choice of works, and the brevity of the volume.
037571457X|5.0|Persepolis is a brilliant book. It is almost impossible to keep your eyes off of the book once you start reading it. The simple but bold drawings definitely add to the mood Marjane tried to create. I recommend Persepolis 1 and 2, Chicken and Plums and Embroideries to anyone who appreciates a creative approach to story telling. The only problem I can see with Marjane Satrapi's books is that there is an end to each book while you wish it could go on and on forever.
B000GFLE86|4.0|For those who love the last two CD's, I would highly recommend going back to Madeleine's debut CD - \\"Dreamland\\".  I stumbled across it in 1997 and fell in love with the subtle, mirky, fragile quality of her voice.  She stretches the song stylings a bit further on \\"Dreamland\\".  Beefier instrumentation, wider song selection and, in my opinion, less of a one-trick pony.  Or, maybe she was searching for what her sound would be.  Much of her next two CD's seem to cover the same ground to me.  \\"Dreamland\\" mixed it up a bit more and to great effect.  Do yourself a favor and pick it up.
B00061QJZI|1.0|...supposed to be funny? Loud, obnoxious, and funny can be hilarious like Jim Carrey or Eddie Murphy. Loud, obnoxious, and completely unfunny can be painfully excruciatingly, agonizing to watch like Will Ferrell and Jack Black. Saw the first hour of this movie surprised I made it that long.
B000JJRIP2|4.0|To all of you who constantly complain about the reissues and different box sets that Kiss releases, this is directed towards you. The reason for the reissues and box sets other than the all popular view of saying Paul and Gene \\"sold out\\" or are only after the money, is the fact that unlike most of the older fans who were actually around in 1976, us younger fans didnt get the chance to buy the old records. Everytime a new medium comes along expect there to be reissues of the records. Just like when VHS converted into DVDs. Were you all complaining then? You dont have to buy the reissues if you dont want to. That is your choice, just stop complaining and rehashing over old ground. If you dont have a new song to sing then shut up and get off the stage.
0723257639|5.0|This is a wonderful little box set and ideal for new readers. Beatrix Potter stories vary in their quality of writing, but all are just wonderfully and whimsically illustrated. Lovely to have them all in their individual books rather than the large collected volume that we have been using at home. As another reader noted, this is great for little hands, but watch out they are easy to lose! <br /> <br />the stories are lovely, most people will know the story of Peter Rabbit and probably Jemima Puddleduck. There are some absolutely wonderful stories in this collection and you will really enjoy getting to know them with your children. The tale of Samuel Whiskers, Two Bad Mice, and Ginger and Pickles are particular favourites of my 3 and 4 year olds. As some characters turn up in other stories, it is a wonderful world for them to inhabit and identify with. <br /> <br />there may be some worries that, as they are 100 years old or so, some things in them are particular to the time and may not be easily explained - but why should this matter? Worlds are full of strange and wonderful things - of imperial measurements, strange rhymes and odd jobs. Of self-fitting candles and pounds, shilling and pence.  <br /> <br />The characters are wonderful and the stories fun - beautifully illustrated too. I would also take this chance to highly recommend the animated dvd and videos of these stories, these are near perfect renditions of the stories and are great for the children to add to the experience - they have Niamh Cusack as Beatrix Potter part narrator.
B000ICM5O4|5.0|1002kbps or 845kbps? This 30th anniversary CD release of the original Rocky film's soundtrack has increased bitrates on all the tracks from remastering. The first number is the bitrate of \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" on this rerelease vs. the original CD release. It all sounds a bit better, making one of the best soundtrack albums of all time even better. But no extra tracks. Surely there must have been more of Conti's score that could have been added? Still, an essential part of anyone's collection of great music and definitely the best album of the entire Rocky series, before they abandoned Bill Conti and went off on that ridiculous pop/rap/rock tangent.
B00005JPGM|5.0|This is one of those once in a long while movies that has everything. It's a thriller, with a multifaceted plot and, of course, love interests on many levels; man and woman, man and family, father and son, people and country. It's grandiose, has beautiful photography. At first I thought it might have been filmed outside of LA. But, it was too beautiful, as Africa is, a paradise lost in war. It's deeply touching to see the power of love of a man for his son, and family. It's deeply moving, as much as any film I've ever seen. Yet, the subject matter is almost documentary about real life events that continue to this day, and as the writer eludes, parallel those of the blood for oil trades. In this way it's an incredibly powerful film and story. Watch this film and if you're on the market for a diamond, you'll think twice.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I picked this CD up as a birthday gift for a friend, who loves Ray Charles. He hadn't seen this album yet, and was very pleased with it, both as a Ray Charles fan, and as a music listener. I've listened to the CD as well, and while it's not my favorite choice, the audio quality does sound good. Recommended.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|This CD meets all that I expected from such a great, original, stand-out artist such as: Gwen Stefani! Another pop/R&B guilty pleasure that Gwen knocks straight out of the park.<br /><br />In my opinion, I find this CD to be more polished and a better mix than her 2004, solo debut, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Although, that CD was good, I just found myself skipping over quite a few songs on it. I have read other poeples reviews of 'The Sweet Escape' and a lot of people are saying that it's 12 songs of a \\"Hollaback Girl\\" sound.....I don't find this to be true. Yes, there are more songs on this set that have more of a R&B sound than her previous effort but, why not bank on something that was such a success and that won you a Grammy(\\"Hollabck Girl\\")?? But, there is also a lot more variety and depth on 'The Sweet Escape' than just that. There is pop, hints of rock, dance, a few slow jams and a few throwback sounding songs.<br /><br />The CD starts off with a bang with the first single and the Sound Of Music influenced song: \\"Wind It Up\\". A VERY catch song that makes you want to hit the nearest dance floor and just let loose. The song just oozes of Gwens originality. Next up is the CD's title track \\"The Sweet Escape\\" with a VERY limited cameo by Akon. This is pure pop through and through. This song for me is just \\"ok\\". It's catchy and all but almost a bit too repetitive. Then we head into one of my favorites on the CD: \\"Orange County Girl\\" - LOVE this song!! Awesome R&B groove to it. Gwen talks about where she came from and how things are so different now but, she has stayed the same. She also speaks about her passion for singing, writing and dancing. SO catchy!! Up next is: \\"Early Winter\\" which you would swear was No Doubt - It has the same sound as No Doubt does. More on the rock side. Very good and different from the rest of the songs on this tracklisting. The next track is \\"Now That You Got It\\" which is another club friendly track with a great beat to it not to mention a catchy hook. Has an alram ringing in the background that sounds like it is straight out of Beyonce's song: \\"Ring The Alarm\\". Great song! \\"4 In The Morning\\" is a slower song that I just cannot seem to get into. Not that it's terrible or anything, I just tend to skip over it. It just does not seem like it is placed in the right spot on the CD. Next up is my FAVORITE song on the CD which will be a HUGE hit (just wait). It's called \\"Yummy\\" and it is just that....YUMMY! It is like nothing I have ever heard before. It is so original. Has a great rap by Pharrell. Gwens lyrics are fantastic, talking about how \\"she knows we've been waiting while she's been off making babies\\". Just an excellent song!!! She refers to the beat at one point, in the song, as \\"disco Tetris\\" - it does remind me of that. Gwen claims in the song \\"It's time to make you sweat\\" then at the end of the song there is about a 1 minute dance breakdown of pure music. FANTASTIC!!!! You will be listening to this song over & over & over again! \\"Fluorescent\\" is another great track that reminds me of an 80's throwback over a slick R&B beat. infectious song! \\"Breakin' Up\\" is a bit of a yawner. The lyrics are a bit juvenile. She speaks about being on a cell phone and she keeps asking \\"can you hear me now??\\". She keeps making phone references in her lyrics. Very skippable. \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" is a fun, upbeat song that has a bit of a reggae beat to it. A fun song that makes you want to get up and move your body. \\"U Started It\\" is another slower to mid-tempo song that start kind of bland but, give it a chance, it will grow on you. I did not care for it at all at first but, it grew on me. Not one of my favorites but, it's decent. Finally is the song: \\"Wonderful Life\\" which is a great way to close the album with. Another song that sounds very heavily No Doubt influenced. I like it a lot. It has more of the pop/rock sound to it. Very infectious melody and lyrics. Great song.<br /><br />Gwen always stands out and 'The Sweet Escape' is no exception. There are so many radio friendly songs on here that I know will be huge hits. The chemistry between her and Pharrell (\\"Hollaback Girl\\") is phenomenal - they just keep churning out hit after hit. She always seems to stay 10 steps ahead of all the \\"pop\\" wannabes and \\"pop\\" hopefulls that are out there today.<br /><br />Go out and purchase this TODAY....you will love it! It's time to.........<br /><br />WIND IT UP!!!!!Escape' is no exception. There are so many radio friendly songs on here that I know will be huge hits.

B000IU3XU6|5.0|Josh Groban has a winning combination: an incredible instrument, good performance instincts, and the willingness to experiment and take risks. What's scary is that as a male at 25, he's not even in his vocal prime yet. He will only continue to improve. <br /> <br />\\"Awake\\" was a matter of combining Josh's own eclectic tastes with the art-music ballads that have been a vehicle for his success thusfar, and allowing himself more control and independance in terms of writing, producing, and playing. Whether the balance the album strikes is a good one is a matter of opinion- personally, I think it's excellent. There's no filler on this album, and whether you prefer Josh's English-language pop or his Italian and French art songs*, you're in for a treat. <br /> <br />This album tends to steadily grow on you. I liked it at first, but love it after several more iterations.  <br /> <br />*I intentionally use the term \\"art music\\" as opposed to \\"classical music\\" or \\"opera\\". Josh is often incorrectly identified as an \\"opera singer\\"- he's not. He's a lyric baritone, and his voice, while indescribably beautiful in its own right, is not the particular style called for, not dark and heavy enough for most opera roles.  I think he's often called \\"operatic\\" because most people don't realize there's more to foreign-language \\"classical\\" vocal music than opera, and the term \\"classical\\" is not strictly correct because it refers to a specific time-period in the history of Western art music. That's probably waaaay more than you ever wanted to know on the subject.
B000007WNN|5.0|I found this album in a sewer when I was 13.  The tape was all wet with sewer juice through the case.  I had heard of the Cult and the name had sparked a ideal of dirty, nasty rock that my mom would not want me to have.  But apparently the devil interviened and I got a hold of this SLEAZE ROCK GEM.  So I shook loose the sewer juice and popped it in and left it in for weeks.  <br />Here it is almost 20 years later and I still love it!!! <br />\\"King Contrary Man\\" is one of the best hard rock tracks of all time.  Fighting music, kid. <br />
B00000DS2T|1.0|Wow. Where do I start? I have all the Rocky soundtracks and this is by far the worst. It's horribly bad. All the '80s songs are dated and horrible. \\"Eye Of The Tiger\\" is recycled from Rocky III. There is NO Bill Conti music on this album. Did he want too much money? Maybe so. His absence is staggeringly obvious. Without Bill Conti's classical orchestrations and the famous Rocky fanfare, there is no real Rocky soundtrack. What we get here is a bunch of crappy pop-rock and some synthesized orchestrations by Vince DiCola that try to put an '80s spin on Bill Conti's work, to horrifying results.<br /><br />There are 2 good things about this album. One is that Frank Stallone is not on it. His laughingly silly contributions to Rocky III thankfully didn't get him invited back. The 2nd good thing is the James Brown song \\"Living In America\\". It's not great, but it's idly amusing enough to mention.<br /><br />Bill Conti is a bigger talent than Sylvester Stallone, and is therefore much more essential to the Rocky franchise. Both this film and its soundtrack are the worst of the series.<br /><br />If you want good Bill Conti music from Rocky, buy the 2006 remasters of Rocky and Rocky II.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Gwen's \\"Sweet Escape,\\" Gwen's attempted move into hip-hop/R&B fare, is more like a slow, bitter torture from which there is NO escape.  <br /> <br />I'll start with what I HATED: Album starts off with one of the worst radio hits of the year, \\"Wind It up.\\" There is nothing more to be said about this song -- it's sheer utter unfathomable horrendousness defies belief. It's really... just... I can't say anything more. The title track is just completely out-of-left-field, but not in the good way like some of Gwen's previous work. It simply makes no sense in the context of the artist or the album. 2nd track \\"O.C. Girl\\" is pretty awful, 'nuff said. \\"Now That You Got It\\" is Gwen trying something new - it would've fit right in on \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\" It doesn't quite work, but it's worth a listen. \\"Yummy\\" is more hip-hop lite insipidness in the vein of Wind It Up. I really think Pharrell's inclusion on this album was it's death-knell.  <br /> <br />Now for what I LIKED: \\"Early Winter\\" is nice sounding, but awfully generic; however it's nice to hear Gwen's actual singing voice after the street cadence half-talk she's been using to deliver her songs for the past couple of years. \\"4 in the Morning\\" is a standout, both lyrically and melodically. Album-closer \\"Wonderful Life\\" sounds like one of the stronger cuts from L.A.M.B. and resembles a poppier version of a Tears for Fears or Depeche Mode song. <br /> <br />In brief, \\"The Sweet Escape\\" will do nothing to enhance Gwen's following or her artistic profile. It will likely continue to garner a fair amount of radio attention, though doubtfully anything like L.A.M.B.'s top-40 success. It's not quite a step backward; it's certainly not a step forward; Gwen essentially shifts laterally without doing anything interesting or innovative. The fundamental problem with Gwen is that, at this point, she's simply trying anything with the hopes of it sounding experimental and unconventional. She's always done that - except it used to sound much, much better than this.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie is up there with Sixth Sense, The Village and Signs. Watch the directors cut version and the ending with blow you away. This is one of my all time favorites and have watched it 4 times and each time I noticed something different. This is a must have for your collection watch it with friend.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|When Maureen O'Hara, the top-billed star of 1947's \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\", proudly proclaims all three 'remakes' of the story were flops, it may sound a bit conceited...but she is absolutely right, the original IS the best...and THIS is the edition that is a MUST for your collection!<br /><br />Based on a story by Valentine Davies (who wondered how the real Santa Claus would react to the commercialization of Christmas), with an Oscar-winning screenplay by director George Seaton, the film is a triumph of perfect casting, perfect timing, and a sentimentality and humor that post-War America desperately needed. Contrary to general opinion, 20th Century Fox did not treat it as a 'minor' film (studio head Darryl F. Zanuck loved the story), but location shooting (at the first Macy's parade since the war began, as well as inside the store, during the Christmas 'rush') would push the budget to the limit.<br /><br />O'Hara (unhappily yanked from a long-awaited return to her Ireland home), and popular Fox leading man John Payne were cast in the leads, but the real 'stars' of the film are Oscar-winning 71-year-old Edmund Gwenn (who is absolutely perfect as 'Kris Kringle', and convinced everyone on the project that he really WAS Santa Claus), and 8-year-old Natalie Wood (the most gifted of the post-War child stars), who brings young Susan brilliantly to life. Their scenes together are so sweet and irresistable that the film positively glows!<br /><br />While elements of the story are 'dated' (the competition between Macy's and Gimbel's, the Postal information, etc.), it simply gives the 1947 version a 'timeless' quality that the 1994 version lacked...and in not attempting to incorporate 'magic' into the story (as the Attenborough production uncomfortably does), it actually seems MORE magical!<br /><br />Several supporting players should be singled out; Thelma Ritter (in her screen debut), is wonderful as a frazzled mom; Gene Lockhart (the judge) and William (\\"I Love Lucy\\") Frawley (as the judge's campaign manager) are hilarious together; and Porter Hall, as the hiss able 'psychologist', Sawyer, is a perfect foil for Gwenn. The entire cast is superb!<br /><br />This edition offers both a B&W AND 'colorized' version of the film, each featuring a warm commentary by O'Hara (taped at the 86-year-old actress' home, in Ireland), two documentaries (including scenes from the Thomas Mitchell, Sebastian Cabot, and Richard Attenborough versions), the bizarre trailer for the film, the complete 1955 TV production starring Mitchell, and a sentimental history of the parade.<br /><br />While the film was, indeed, originally released in the summer of 1947 (to maximize profits), it is a bona fide Christmas 'Classic', and should be an essential part of your holiday collection!wley (as the judge's campaign manager) are hilarious together; and Porter Hall, as the hiss able 'psychologist', Sawyer, is a perfect foil for Gwenn.

0780626494|4.0|As far as chemistry goes in Romantic Comedy films, Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone have it all. They are both actors who feed very well off other actors and this movie is a prime example. While the movie may sound a little silly, the beauty of it is in the acting and the chemistry and after the 90 minutes is up you will be left feeling very happy and positive from this heart warming comedy. It is one of those feel good movies you will want to watch over and over again and is well worth adding to your DVD collection.
B00031TXBI|5.0|Everytime I hear it I love it more & I connect with it more. <br />This was the first record I bought from John Frusciante after stumbling upon a jam session he had done with Omar from Mars Volta.  I quickly remembered how much I admired John Frusciante's playing on RHCPs work while not caring for the band itself as of late (don't get me wrong they play great, they are just irrelevant to me at this time). <br />This album blew me away & I downloaded more to dig deeper.  This of course had me hooked so I ditched the pirate booty & bought every record he made.  Each I love & has it's own charms and styles, but this still is my favorite.   <br />While I recomend everyone to check them all out.  If this is your 1st John Frusciante record purchase this is a perfect start to a new addiction. <br />
B00005QFE5|4.0|The Road Home is a powerful film about love and the trials and tribulations one goes through getting there. Right from the start the audience is presented with an undertone of sadness. Although it is ok to fall apart, somebody has to stay strong and take care of business. Often in times of overwhelming sadness the bereaved are so out of touch with reality that everything would fall apart without someone sensible to step into crisis mode.<br /><br /> These scenes of sadness and funeral preparation are intermingled with a beautiful love story. In a small village in China, a young couple is falling in love. This is a unique experience for a backward society where ancient and outdated traditions are still practiced.  Sometimes the interactions between Shao Di and Changyu are so subtle that it is hard to catch the hidden meaning behind the exchange. This film really plays up the importance of a glance or a light touch. When you look in someone's eyes, it is beautiful to see understanding gained without the exchange of a single word. I really admire how the directors choose to make this film about love instead of sex. America is a sex-saturated society where many relationships begin and end with a mere exchange of bodily fluids. It is fascinating to me that other cultures can make a sexless film that appeals to more than just children.<br /><br /> Before this class, I had almost no experience with foreign films. Until now, I did not realize there were any films without cussing, violence, and sex being made now a days. I have been so indoctrinated with the Hollywood formula films that I forgot what a true piece of artistry looks like. I did not realize a movie could be both entertaining and educational. Kudos to the Road Home for being so tasteful and entertaining. This is definitely hands down my most favorite film of this class. I am so grateful I was made to watch it. By the end, I found myself almost in tears.<br /><br /> Although just a story the Road Home gives, you hope that true love really does exist. Why would someone risk endangering the wrath of the government for a woman if she was not his true love? It makes you feel good inside when you see a couple fighting against all odds to come back to each other. In western society, we often take dating and falling in love for granted. In our culture, people fall in and out of love every single day. This movie teaches you a great lesson about not taking love for granted. As someone who has fallen in love for the first time it is reassuring to see a couple that had every obstacle in the world placed in front of him or her succeed? I always thought that Sean and I met to young and would not make it. Shoa Di and Changy were young and had every conceivable obstacle in their way. No one thought they would make it. As the critics would say The Road Home is the feel good movie of the year.<br /><br /> Red according to desktop publishing dot com, denotes purity, joy, and celebration. In Chinese culture, red symbolizes happiness and prosperity and is often used for good luck. In the movie if you look close enough you might have seen how the young Shoi Di was wearing red every time she ran into her crush. If you knew anything about the color red, you would know that the red on her jacket is supposed to be an outward symbol of her happiness. She often thinks of marrying the teacher and celebrating the occasion. The red banner in the schoolhouse is used for good luck. Many of the modern day scenes are shown in black and white.  According to dictionary dot labor law talk, dot com black and white is used in contrast with color in movies because the scenes or characters done in black and white are either more outdated or dull than the characters and scenes shot in full-color. I think that this assessment is true because the village is a little run down compared to the past. Mostly the only people living there now are old people and a few kids. Most of the citizens have moved on to a more populated area that is more modern and interesting. This town is rather dull.<br /><br /> In the end, you feel attached to the town.

B000J10ERO|2.0|Despite having modern special effects and an awesome Lex Luthor, played by Kevin Spacey, Superman Returns disappointed me more than a little.<br /><br />First of all, Superman stands for, \\"Truth, justice and the American Way,\\" not \\"Truth, justice and all that stuff.\\" All that stuff? All that stuff? What kind of anti-American person wrote this movie? Look, if you hate America that's your business, but don't corrupt Superman!<br /><br />Second, Superman has an out-of-wedlock child with Lois Lane! Then when he finds out about this child, he doesn't even *attempt* to talk her into making things right by getting married. What sort of morals are you trying to teach our young people in this country with this horrific example of making babies with no thought of marriage? Technically, Superman and Lois Lane never actually did the big nasty because of time travel. Did the director even watch the previous movies?<br /><br />Supposedly, Superman went on a five year trip to the destroyed planet Krypton, just because he \\"had to see it.\\" Had to see it? Who goes on a five year trip solo just to see something that isn't there anymore? Been to Mount Saint Helens lately? What did he eat? Drink? Did he share this miraculous new interspace travel with the rest of the world so they could explore the galaxy? Oh, he was too busy sightseeing to consider that.<br /><br />There are just too many holes and inconsistencies with the story here, and Superman, greatest of all heroes and role models, has been corrupted. Someone make a better movie, please!

B000JBXXZ4|4.0|The best way I can sum up to this album, is that it takes a bit from every Incubus album to date. While the previous 3 albums were all unique in their own right, this one draws a bit of influence from each one, making it instantly recognisable for fans. At only 48 minutes long, it is the perfect length and superbly produced by the legendary Brendan O'Brien, who also took the reins on 'A crow left of the murder'.<br /><br />A negative however is I don't believe this is anywhere near Brandon's finest effort lyrically, certainly a long way from 'Make Yourself'. They seem to have been rushed although I am probably being a bit hasty in my judgement as I have only listened to the album a few times.<br /><br />Overall, it is hard to place this in order in the Incubus catalogue. It may be my least favourite Incubus album, but still very good and enjoyable at the same time. There are no standout tracks on here as there were on their previous albums, but so far 'Dig', 'Love Hurts', and 'Pendulous Threads' are my favourites. I believe this album will appeal to all Incubus fans. All the fans from Day 1 as well as those who may have jumped on the Incubus wagon along the way.<br /><br />Enjoy...
B000I5X81K|4.0|A girl that I had dated two years ago turned me onto Josh Groban.  Imagine me, a pretty masculine guy, turned on to someone like Josh Groban.  It wasn't long before I went to see him in concert and meet him personally backstage.  In person he is extremely shy, but none of that shyness translates into his music.<br /><br />Owning his first three CDs (that include his LIVE concert), I was a bit taken back by AWAKE.  As is mentioned in a previous review here, AWAKE is a departure from what you might expect from Mr. Groban.  Upon my first listening I was not overly impressed.  The album didn't seem to grab me in the same manner that CLOSER did.<br /><br />Having now listened to AWAKE countless times over the past two weeks I must confess that I have come to really enjoy the material here.  The music seems to be a bit more styled towards \\"pop radio,\\" and there is some interesting collaboration on the three final tracks with artists Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Herbie Hancock which is good but quite frankly, I could have done without.  Josh does just fine on his own.<br /><br />For me, the absolute best song on this album is Track #4, FEBRUARY SONG.  You gotta love the way this song climbs into a frenzied cresecendo that is just magnificent.<br /><br />I would have easily given this album 5 stars if not for the fact that despite its greatness, it still lacks behind CLOSER.<br /><br />This album will not disappoint Josh Groban fans everywhere!
1569242739|5.0|The moment I pledged my devout allegiance to this book was when my husband's entire family (including my mother-in-law, who used to work at a bakery) fell in love with the gingerbread cupcakes w/ lemon buttercream icing I made from \\"Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World.\\"  <br /> <br />Baking does not come naturally to me - thankfully, this cupcake book provides really good details and pictures that help any novice make beautiful, tasty cupcakes.   <br /> <br />TRUE SELLING POINT:  Instead of \\"replacing\\" ingredients (i.e. substituting eggs with applesauce) the authors clearly took a lot of time and effort to concoct a perfect balance of ingredients to make these taste amazing, rather than like a \\"veganized' version of the \\"real thing.\\"   <br /> <br />I cannot wait to try out some of the \\"fancy\\" cupcake recipes, like pistachio rosewater or the boston cream pie cupcakes.  Brownie cupcakes look amazing, too, since I have not yet been able to create a good vegan brownie. <br /> <br />\\"Vegan Cupcakes\\" is consistent with what I had expected from Isa's other book, \\"Vegan with a Vengeance.\\"  Along with the recipes, there is fun, cheeky commentary that makes the book so unique.   <br /> <br />In short, this book is great for vegans and non-vegans alike.  You do not need dairy or eggs to enjoy these sweet & adorable treats!

B00005JPCY|4.0|On Fat Tuesday in New Orleans, a ferry explodes offshore.  Over 500 people are dead, most of them military.  ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington) is called in to investigate this act of terrorism.  FBI agent Pryzwarra (Kilmer) is running the investigation and is immediately impressed with Carlin.  Soon Carlin finds himself on the inside of an elite agency that has the capability to look exactly four days and six hours into the past.  Carlin does not believe Pryzwarra's explanation of the system, and is determined to find out exactly how it works.<br /><br />Tony Scott, master of ADD filmmaking manages to reel things in a bit with \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\".  Best described as a time travelling action mystery, \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\" is highly entertaining.  Denzel Washington brings a typical Denzel Washington performance to the film, and that is just fine.  He is not stretching here, but the performance is familiar, and it gets the job done.  The story is interesting and not too confusing as time traveling stories can sometimes be.  There are some action sequences, but they are not as prevalent as one might expect from a Tony Scott film.  Overall, \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\" delivers the entertaining diversion that it sets out to provide, and I recommend it.
B000K9L32U|5.0|In the early 1990s, Take That was the UK's answer to New Kids on the Block.  Take That had a top 10 hit with \\"Back for Good\\" in 1995, a schmaltzy pop song that could've come from any random boy band being manufactured at the time. I had forgotten Take That existed until I discovered the brilliant solo work of Mark Owen and Robbie Williams while traveling to Europe and listening to the BBC on the web. I bought tall the old Take That albums, and needless to say, I preferred the Take That members apart than together.  So, I was very skeptical of this record, since I'm not a fan of boy band manufactured pop (e.g. `Nsync, Backstreet Boys, etc.). <br /> <br />After just one listen, I've become a Take That convert. This album is nothing like their tween pop of the '90s. It's Beatle-esq in its pop-rock cross over, and will appeal to a wide range of musical tastes and audiences.  In the spirit of bands like the Beatles, the entire record showcases the vocal and songwriting talents of each of its members, making each song unique. Some of Mark Owen's best work is on this album. 'Shine' and 'Hold On' are quintessential Owen tunes and are among the best on the album. 'What You Believe In' will appeal most to fans of Owen's Radiohead-inspired solo work. Gary Barlow, who came off stiff and uninspired in the Take That of yore, is  comfortable in his skin on this record. 'Ain't No Sense in Love' is the best of his vocal tracks. While I'm not a big fan of Barlow's love ballads, the ones on Beautiful World are well composed and listenable. 'Paitence' and 'I'd Wait for Life' are standouts for Barlow, and show that he not only has a personality, but that he can write and sing inspired and  richly diverse ballads that will appeal to people other rather that a fan base of screaming teenage girls.   <br /> <br />While contributions from Robbie Williams would've added an interesting dimension to this album, the four members of Take That show that their collective talents only make them better individual artists. The biggest surprise on the album was 'Wooden Boat.'  This contemporary folk song is unrecognizable from the techno-dance Take That of yesterday. I thought Jason Orange was just resident eye candy for teen girls, but he can actually sing. Babe, where have you been? <br /> <br />Beautiful World is an outstanding album, one of the best of 2006. This is  definitely Grammy material. I am convinced that if this record were released in America, the new Take That would achieve what the old Take That could not: true international success. Well done guys. Can't wait for the next one.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Esta pelicula hay que verla, y hay que verla pronto para que nos enteremos de lo que estamos haciendo con nuestro planeta. Excelente Sr. Gore.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This film is the quintessential example of \\"Junk Science\\".  He and is ilk love Computer Generated Models (CGM) but fail to understand the simple axiom: Junk in = junk out.  Algore and his followers love to make statements that Global Warming caused by humans is an indisputable fact put forth by a consensus of scientists. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus.  The work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus--consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science, consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great, precisely because they broke with the consensus. These guys can't predict what the weather will be in 12 hours let alone, 20, 50 or 100 years from now--Algore, stop trying to snow us!  We're not as dumb as you are!<br /><br />Remember back in the 70's when the \\"consensus of scientists\\" made dire warnings of the coming Ice Age, and those that disagreed were called heretics.  They said there was no time to verify the facts, we had to act before it would be too late, or we would suffer this calamity.  Sound familiar?  The Earth is a living planet, with many factors we can't even begin to understand that influence the climate.  Before they make any more mistakes trying to mess with the planet, I would urge them to proceed very carefully.<br /><br />Algore gives new meaning to the term: a blithering boob.  His IQ is less than the square root of his shoe size, even though he thinks it's the square of his ever-growing neck size--and this from a guy who flunked out of Divinity school.  Yet he has the temerity to criticize President Bush's intelligence.  Does Algore have an MBA from Harvard?  Can you spell MBA Al?<br /><br />You just have to love the fact that he is making statements excoriating the Bush Administration's failures to address Global Warning from a private jet, so much for saving our planet, eh Algore?  How many 1000's of gallons of jet fuel were wasted polluting our planet in this film?  He & Bill did nothing while they ran the country, \\"do as I say, rather than do as I do\\" is their typical mantra, right Algore?  Perhaps when he only drives a Yugo and flies back with the masses in economy class, will anyone ever begin to take him seriously.<br /><br />I'm sure this waste of good film is lock to win an Academy Award, as Hollywood always embraces such inane drivel as this.have to love the fact that he is making statements excoriating the Bush Administration's failures to address Global Warning from a private jet, so much for saving our planet, eh Algore?

B0007GAERG|2.0|When she emerged in 1990, Mariah Carey seemed destined to be one of the most talented vocalists on the planet, and she unquestionably was for the first half of that decade. Unfortunately, she would soon make a decision that is unfortunately all too common in music today: reinvent herself to appeal mainly to the shallow mind. After a series of sub-par albums from the late 90s, \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" was hailed by some publications as \\"her best album in years.\\" Sorry, but not quite. She's in decent vocal form on \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" and a couple of others, but for the most part, she sings in a light feathery tone that sounds too much like many of the faceless posers that inundate today's music world. Plus, none of the songs (especially the ones on which she collaborates with rappers), are as deep and meaningful as anything she did a decade ago.

0446677450|5.0|VERY easy to understand book about a concept that I think so many intelligent people in this country (or world?) aren't taught enough about. Personal finance and investing are such simple concepts that are very neglected in our current educational system. This is an excellent book for high school students and adults alike, whether they are aspiring to be business leaders or blue collar employees. <br /> <br />While Mr. Kiyosaki will hint at methods to achieve personal wealth (especially real estate), this book is more about how to think about how to make money, and what a financial \\"asset\\" really is. <br /> <br />After reading this book, some of my friends and I have changed our investing behavior for the better... and I will always think of money in a different way.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Amazing voice.  Always enjoy it.  Thanks, Josh.  Thanks to David Foster and David E. Kelley for making sure the world heard such a gift.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|This was a big disappointment - just like \\"Vanilla Sky.\\"  Lots of big names behind the movie but no real substance or story.   I had to turn on the captions due to the fact there were so many heavy accents or just plain mumbling.  Everyone was just too cool to speak clearly.    If you are going to use a brand name - at least own up to some of its history.  It was like they wanted to use a well known name to reel you in but not have any other association with it whatsoever.  The only thing that this movie has in common with the television series is the title and the names of some of the characters.  Gone was the humor with Zito and Switek - heck, I couldn't even figure out who was who in the movie.    Also gone was the fantastic music.  The series was well known for breaking new artists and new songs.  There was a cover version of Phil Collins' \\"In Air Tonight\\".  It was awful.  I thought it was a karaoke version of the song for a minute.   Did they spend all their money on salaries and couldn't afford the version by Phil Collins?  They had to pay royalties for the song - why not use Phil's version?  The rest of the soundtrack was lackluster.  I've heard better music on commercials !!    I read an article stating that the shooting of the movie was marred with bad weather and other unrest.  The story got so slow that I was looking at the background to see the bad weather in the shots.  Ernesto was bearing down on Miami with Katrina soon following.      I am all for style and Michael Mann has an impressive resume in that genre.  This movie didn't make the cut in either story or genre.  It is all in the script.  Big stars and a well known name could not save this movie.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I have many Christmas CD's that I have collected over the years, but this one is by far the best.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone, whether they know Sarah McLachlan's music or not.  She is an amazing artist who continually out does herself and she definitely proves it with this CD.  I will listen to this CD all year round.  It is very relaxing and sets a peaceful tone during these busy holidays!  It's a must have!
B00005JOQS|2.0|Superman really needs no introduction and I was looking forward to seeing the movie after hearing critic after critic rave about the merits of the film. After watching it myself I have to say that I am left feeling disappointed at what could have been a terrific film. The sound and special effects are first class as would be expected. However, the plot and the characters are poorly conceived. My biggest complaint is that the characters are all two dimensional. Superman struts his stuff as the ultimate alpha male, exuding confidence and calm, physically and emotionally impermeable. In other words there is very little about him with which mere mortals can identify. <br /> <br />I like to see at least a little vulnerability in my heroes. And I am not talking about the inevitable kryptonite scene which leaves Superman on death's door. I am talking about struggles such as Spiderman's soul searching quest to discover whether he even wants to don his spider suit again. I understand that Superman is supposed to be the epitome of perfection. However, surely after the gripping and engaging characters in X-Men and Spiderman the writers could have done a better job with this one. <br /> <br />The ultimate test is to gauge audience reaction as Superman is about to die. Sadly, the scene does not engage me at any emotional level. Prior to this, the film does very little to foster emotional attachment to its main protagonist. I have read stories about people crying but I think this is more due to their attachment to Superman as a great American icon, rather than any particular connection with Superman as depicted in this film. In summary I would say that you are not missing much if you do not see this film.
B000002JPA|5.0|I could easily write a long review of this album and explain why I think you should buy it...but I will keep it short. All I can say is when I first heard this album...it changed my life forever. If you love music and a wide variety of music...you will appreciate this cd. Just imagine the greatest pop, metal, jazz, new age, rock, Progressive rock, Blues, Movie music all wrapped into one. This album expresses everything from vast melodies, virtuostic playing, excellent lyricism, well crafted songwriting, powerful riffs to an optimistic backdrop. This is by far my favorite album of all time, I have been hooked since the day I first heard it...and I still listen to it non stop 13 years later. All I can say is...GET THIS ALBUM!
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Admittedly, I've never been a huge Gwen Stefani fan, but her music (and No Doubt's) was at least listenable.  By that I mean I wouldn't automatically change the station if it came on the radio, but I've never been compelled to buy a CD.  So, when she appeared on SNL last week, I thought, \\"Well, I guess I can wait until the commercial break to go to the bathroom.\\"  Mistake.  Big mistake.  I, too, am unable to explain my feelings about her performance of \\"Wind It Up\\" (and a quick listen to the album version didn't really clear things up for me).  It's almost as if she and Fergie are playing some sort of crappy music poker, and Gwen has just upped the ante.  The drums alone might have been kind of cool, but then she had to shriek throughout the entire song.  It was an audio (and visual) trainwreck.  They say having kids changes you, but it's not always for the better.  When did music get to be so stupid?
0316168815|4.0|This was an incredibly moving story.  It is difficult to write about a situation such as that encountered in the book and avoid cliches and recycling of previous ideas.  Sebold uses a beautiful creativity and freshness in her writing and blends palpable sadness and grief with hope and personal growth into a very remarkable book.  This book was difficult to put down, and the ending is quite satisfactory.
B00008DDSC|4.0|If you are tired of the pastry puff pop culture movies meant for those that are not as smart as you, this may be your movie.  I for one can't stand how dumbed down many movies are these days.  If you enjoy dark humor and revel in awkward situations on screen you might enjoy it.  Plus she is hot.
B000JKA0B0|5.0|The price may have made me cry, but the cd itself is pretty amazing. The cuts from concerts all over the world are great! There's alot of music here, and its all amazing!
B00005NP04|4.0|This beautiful Kansas native gives her fans all but one of her best on this collection. The \\"one\\" refers to Bob Seger's love ballad CHANCES ARE,his duet with Martina McBride. Seger probably decided not to green-light the 1998 hit on this collection in favor of its recycling on his 2003 release,GREATEST HITS 2. It was originally released on the HOPE FLOATS movie soundtrack. The track I like best on this collection is I LOVE YOU. I can't tell you how many times I heard that song over the satellite feed in the two places I worked at in the last seven-and-a-half years. That track isn't just country,it's also soft rock. The other tracks are cool.

B0006IIPIK|3.0|Even on DVD, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow has serious image problems, although the fact that the movie is deliberately stylised makes it a little less of a problem. Unfortunately, the two-tone, almost sepia color and the excessive diffusion of the image tends to bleed the film of vitality at times and does no favors whatsoever to Gwyneth Paltrow, who looks absolutely terrible throughout the film (the fact that her performance is not just bad but plain unlikeable much of the time doesn't help: small wonder that Angeline Jolie steals the film from her). Kerry Conran does manage to recreate some of the visual style of the old Max and Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons (Mechanical Monsters in particular), but without their vivid three-strip Technicolor, and he gives good montage. Unfortunately, he's better at visual design than directing actors or action - this should be a lot more fun than it actually is. Jude Law is a particularly weak hero, lacking steel or much in the way of charisma, once again proving that he's a better character actor in supporting roles than a credible leading man. It's watchable enough and the big undersea dogfight shows how much better it could have been, but never draws you in and carries you along enough to be as much fun as it wants to be. And if you're going to use footage of Laurence Olivier to `play' the villain, at least find a voice double who actually sounds like him!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I'm from Austria, Europe and couldn't help buying these DVDs. They are Region Code 1 but run on my Codefree Player at home.  <br />This show was and still is the greatest ever made! It deals with all problems and situations teenager and to-be-adults have to deal with. You can laugh, you can cry, you can feel with them.  <br />Buy them, you won't regret it!
B000FMGTTE|5.0|This is a sequel score that for once more than lives up to the original. <br />John Ottman's music is simply superb.His action sequence cues are all <br />excellent(the final battle scene is especailly outstanding).The highlights <br />are his beauftiful love theme and the themes for Superman and Lois.But the best feature of the score is his brilliant use of the original classic <br />John Williams themes.Overall,this is one of the year's best soundtracks.
B000JRYNXE|5.0|Gwen Stefani brings an album full of surprises, with fantasy toyland candy beats,  cool sounds, and hypnotic lyrics, with emotions busting at the seams! This album shows how Gwen has grown as an artist. Every track on the album is great and it would be hard to pick out a favorite! Although the lead single \\"Wind It Up\\" is originated from \\"The sound of Music\\", I can't help but to compare it to \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\". This complete album is amazing. I think some people judge it to harshly, with the release of more singles i'm sure more people will see its a true gem! Most artist put out albums that only contain a few good songs. Gwen is one of those rare artist that delivers an full album with great material, and no album fillers. These songs will make you dance, or wish you knew how to dance! The Sweet Escape album lets you escape from the world and enjoy the music of Gwen Stefani
B000J10EQU|4.0|Okay,you can now officailly forget the last two Superman films.Supie has returned with a bang!Bryan Singer and his talented colleagues remind us <br />just how much fun the series was.This is a solid,well-done action movie <br />that also has some emotional depth to it.The script is good of this kind, <br />the production values are top-notch(the photography,special effects,and <br />John Ottoman's music are outstanding),and Singer's direction is excellent. <br />But the movie is too long.I'll say it again-WHY DO ALL THESE \\"BIG\\" MOVIES <br />HAVE TO BE NEARLY THREE HOURS???But it's the splendid cast that really puts the movie over.Eva Marie Saint,Frank Langella,James Marsden,and Kal Penn are all wonderful.Parker Posey and Kevin Spacey ham it up delightfully.Margot Kidder is still the definitive Lois Lane,but Kate <br />Bosworth is excellent here.However,the movie belogs to its star.Brandon  <br />Routh is every inch the equal of Christopher Reeve,to whom he bears an uncanny resemblance.Yes,ladies,he looks GREAT in the tights.He also brings <br />charm,charisma,depth,and conviction to Superman.This is the breakout star <br />performance of the year.And the movie is one of the most flat-out entertaining films of the year.\\"Superman Returns\\" in style!
0380789035|4.0|American Gods is an urban fantasy that deals with gods. What makes this novel original is the fact that it tells of gods in a way anyone would tell a story about human beings.<br /><br />This book is one of those books that got the best of me. Its vivid story-telling is fascinating that the images never obscured in my mind; the places, the characters, the situations, and the tensions would still come flashing in my head as starkly as the text was written. Another reason why I really liked this novel is that it provides some historical background about the gods. It made the book even more interesting, although sometimes I don't get its relevance to the actual story. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every bit of it, because it made me really happy in a way that good books do.<br /><br />American Gods is a thoroughly imagined piece of literature. It is evident of a well-thought plot, interesting and (sometimes) funny characters, heart-racing adventures across the US, and an imagery filled with dark colors just enough for you to think that the world you're reading about is dangerous. A slow read at first, it turns itself into a gripping tale as the pages turn that you would want nothing more than to know what happens next, especially if you're an avid fantasy reader or a Neil Gaiman fan. Truly an adventure you wouldn't want to miss out! 4.5 stars.
B000AYELVA|5.0|X-Men has proven itself as a movie that doesn't get old, no matter how many times it is seen. I have watched this movie many times and it still isn't boring, that is the best thing that can be said about movie. That it has a long life and can still be enjoyed years after it's release, and X-Men definitely fits that category. But, what is not to like about this movie?<br /><br />The casting for it is perfect, Ian McKellen makes a great Magneto and Patrick Stewart makes a perfect Professor Charles Xavier. The same things can be said for everyone in the movie and who they were cast as in the film. It is done so perfectly, it adds to the story and makes me wonder if this movie would have been as powerful as it is if other people were cast in this film. Let's not forget the special effects that are used in this movie. That is definitely eye candy for sure. The mutant powers look great when they are used in this movie and look realistic. It is really cool to see Wolverine's adamantium claws first slowly come out in the bar.<br /><br />The story doesn't follow the comics as well as I had hoped they would. The biggest example I could see in the film is that Wolverine and Sabertooth don't know each other prior to their meeting in this movie, but in the comic, they have known each other for years. Despite the lack of being 100% like the comic, this movie makes a story of it's own and the previous story isn't really needed. It is so compelling in the way it is told, it can be forgiven for its very small mistakes for sure. This is definitely a have to see movie. If you haven't by now, you need to!
B000IU3XTM|1.0|I would have rather given it a half of a star but Amazon does not allow this appropriate rating. I loved O; he blew a gale but on this one he is just sucking wind.  You know after a few listenings I thought much more of this CD.
B000HBKCDC|3.0|I've heard a few of Sarah McLachlan's songs over the years and decided to buy this CD on impulse.  <br /> <br />I think the lady has a good voice but I didn't really care for this album. She didn't really rework the songs into unrecognizable versions (the songs I do know anyway)but her delivery wasn't traditional enough to suit me I guess. I tended to like her singing more than the musical accompaniment- especially #7 \\"The First Noel/ Mary Mary\\" the music was way off on that one, didn't care for the blended songs either. My favorite song on the entire CD would have to be #10 \\"Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\"- it comes out the closest to what I want in a Christmas song. <br /> <br />I'll give her a try on some of the other songs, once I figure out which albums to get.
B000K9L32U|3.0|\\"I'd Wait For Life\\" Is The Only Song That sounds Like Gary Barlow's Voice. <br />I prefer \\"Take That\\" with Gary singing all the leads. If your a Big Gary Barlow Fan you won't like This CD that much. I was disappointed he didn't sing all the leads. This Other \\"singer\\" does not even compare to Gary. <br />And if I am wrong and Gary is singing lead on other songs, His voice changed for the worse. <br />Gary....Get a solo CD out, you don't need these other 3 guys !!! <br />that other guy ( I think Owen)  has a bad voice......It Was a \\"Beautiful World\\" when Gary sang all the leads for Take That.

B000LB4DWO|3.0|It was good but I noticed in one scene they totally replaced SuperMan with an animated SuperMan that looked like something off of the SHREK movie. It was a scene where they could of had a real person, he was just standing and looking around like a cybersex doll.
0743289412|5.0|How much Stephen King would like us to believe he is singing the praise and power of the pool of language and myths in which he has found all his stories. But this book is not about this pool, in spite of his author's statement. And this attempt at hijacking us onto a false road is not even humility or modesty, shyness or bashfulness. It is simply and purely disguise. He is trying to derail us from the proper tracks. This book is a marvellous story about a whole life seen from after its end and through the eyes of the spouse of the recently deceased and departed husband. She looks at him, and in a way Stephen King looks at himself, from beyond his own grave, reached for the character, still to be reached for Stephen King. This way of contemplating the end of a story or of a life, what's more his own life, is new for King. The Dark Tower series ended up with the death of the negative and tyrannical fatherly Crimson King but opened onto a new beginning that was exactly like the first one seven volumes before. In the Dark Half he got rid of and mourned his own twin brother, the doppelganger that haunts his own life, the perverse writer's mind that shadows every moment in his life. He is saved in the end. We could also think of Rose Madder where a beaten wife tries to escape a real husband by wasting and dropping him in some kind of Minotaur's labyrinth to be killed by the bull (so close to and so different from the bool). In this case the similitude is not real because the husband is not dead and she does not mourn him. She escapes from him in order to be able to start anew with another man. This present story is a long mourning tale about the death of a popular writer buried and remembered by his wife and then widow, which is also the real departure of this husband, the real farewell to this husband. She learns how to part from her dear departed. The story is poignant because little by little the whole secret life - and we all have at least one secret life - that has haunted and inspired Scott Landon, the hero of the tale, all along and even beyond his own death, is revealed to us. Poignant because it reveals the real inspiration of all horror writers : everyday real life the way it lives and thrives in all the little unbelievable stories on the back page of some tabloid. These small news items that sound both so true and so incredibly impossible. Real life is a lot more horror packed and fear spined than we would like to believe. And we are speaking of our peaceful life in our western countries. Imagine what it may be like in Darfur or Gaza. I know I am ambiguous in this section about the author as being the character of the book and the author of the book. I do not mean to say both are the same and what is attributed to the character of the book is what can be attributed to the author of the book. I just say the character in the book is a metaphor of the author of the book. And that's why this book has another interest of a totally different origin and fragrance. All literature, great, popular, learned, sophisticated, or whatever, is always the product of its author's imagination which flows from his memory being mashed through the distorting blender of real life and grafted onto what may grow in the public garden of our social hell, because society is some kind of hell somewhere, somehow, even if we believe it is not. This book is such a constantly mutating patchwork of transmutant recollections, borrowings and distortions. King even gives this patchwork a name. It is an African, the big brother of a smaller brother called a Delight. This African, a wedding present, holds the power to cross from one world to the other, or to anchor the carrier into one world or other. This African-Delight is the metaphor of two couples : bigger brother vs smaller brother, or author vs spouse. And it may be seen as a tragic metaphor of two other pairs : author-character vs his crazy yet loving and though assassinated father or author vs absentfather, a father he must have killed so many times in his long life, a father that is so often metaphorically killed, assassinated, or at times vindicated (another way to murder someone) in so many novels. In other words, this novel, like so many others, is a perfect example of a mythology at work in King's literature. But a mythology that enables us, all of us, to step beyond our fear of the world, of death, beyond our rage at a world that is going whimsical and warped in the heads of some politicians and leaders that wrap up their own phantasms in deadly decisions that plough up countries and peoples with bombs and other deadly bonbons. That's what lurks between the lines, among the words, behind the pages and beyond the margins. Pick the yarn or thread of the African and trace up all the stations of the bool of this author and come face to face with the long boy of King's obsessions.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnefather, a father he must have killed so many times in his long life, a father that is so often metaphorically killed, assassinated, or at times vindicated (another way to murder someone) in so many novels.

B0000DDAU9|5.0|If you know anything about music or musician ship, you can't help but be in awe at what these guys have created. I was first told to buy this album many years ago by a co-worker that was very much in the \\"death metal\\" scene. I was skeptical at first, b/c I'm not really much of a death metal fan, but when he told me how heavy this was, I had to check it out. I am really glad I bought it. The music is heavy, but it isn't as much \\"death metal\\" as I expected. It is technical, fast at times, and just a wall of heavyness at times (listen to the track \\"trainwreck\\"). This is truly and exceptional piece of music that spanes many genres of metal. The true stand out Mastodon is most definetly the drumming. Yes, I saw them live, back before they were as big as they are now, and yes, Brian can really play even better live. Amazing stuff. If you like anything about metal or just have an appreciation for all genres of music, buy this. Don't read any more reviews, just do it. Superb.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Strangely enough this film about New York at the time of the Civil War is more about the end of the hellish gate to some kind of lawless and wild wild west it is living through than its real depiction. New York was the immigrating harbour and as such had an enormous and constantly changing population. The turn-over as they say today was extremely rapid. It was also a very cosmopilitan city that accepted all nationalities but also all races. But the political and security organizations and institutions were far from up to what it should  have been. In other words, and corruption demultiplied this phenomenon, gangs were everywhere and particularly the good old gang of native Americans, meaning the Americans who had been born in American, in the US, against all the others, the immigrants, the foreigners who come and eat your bread out of your mouth as is well known.<br /><br />Constant fight, constant strife, constant rivalry and daily casualties in a constant violence of every single second, day and night. Killing, hanging, lynching, stabbing, shooting, and so many other variants of these were everyday entertainment and distraction. The film focuses on the Irish as the main opponents of the native American gang.<br /><br />I find the film a little bit complacent as for the picturing and illustrating of this violence, and that pushes other issues a little bit in the background, for instance the rich bourgeoisie of fifth avenue, the merchants and the industrialists. The working class in the sweatshops are not shown either. This is slightly regrettable, because we do not understand then why politicians feel obliged to have some kind of alliance with one gang or the other. They have to choose such an alliance as opposed to the possibility for the working class poor to come together and join forces with the various minorities and fight for their own candidates in the elections.<br /><br />The Civil War provides the best surrounding environment for such a film too because of the anti-draft movement that develops in New York around 1863-64. This anti-draft movement could be the element that might make all the segments of the poor coalesce in one invincible majority. Scorsese shows very well, through the gangs and through  the two leaders of native Americans and the Irish, how a possible alliance could have come out of this situation, but the gang war going on prevents basic interests to prevail in the name of jingoistic community interests.<br /><br />Scorsese seems to be wishing for us to believe that gang violence has always been the way for the establishment in New York to sail through all tempests, storms and other social hurricanes. It is a very pessimistic film that opens no perspective whatsoever. Then what about the acting of the various actors ? It is essentially Leornardo Di Caprio that I observed, following his iron hard and steel cold eyes in the film. He is so static most of the time, and when he is not , when he is moving he seems to be sliding slowly across the room, the street  or the screen without any body language. Even his face seems to be expressionless except for his eyes. He looks like an actor who has risen or been raised in an environment of violence that has left some kind of shock in him, the shock that makes him step back, melt in the wall tapestry and keep out of trouble all the time. Will he ever learn how to use his body to express feelings, action, speed, and so many elements that have to be made visible on the screen because they cannot be described with words ?<br /><br />He has a real problem now his adolescent looks and naivety and charm have gone and he is obliged to move a body and move in it that has become slightly too heavy for him. Having seen what he did in The Departed, I believe he can learn, but he definitely still has a lot to improve. Good luck on the way to San Francisco.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUhat develops in New York around 1863-64.

B000H5U65C|3.0|sold out, that is.  this is not necessarily something that i think is bad, either.  i just miss the old mastodon a la \\"remission.\\"  where did the atmosphere and creative unstoppable drumming go?  i would say this is not for everyone, especially if you didn't evolve along the way with mastodon.  i kind of skipped over everything once i got remission, and i definitely didn't enjoy this album.   <br /> <br />i can't diss these musicians, they are excellent (each in their own way) but this album just didn't do it for me.  3 stars in my opinion, but see for yourself before you judge the record based on my opinion, or any of the ones here for that matter.
0743454537|2.0|This was a well written and thoughtful book dealing with a serious and real issue in today's world of scientific manipulation of human lives.  However the last ten pages made me really angry. Seriously I was yelling at this book after reading the last ten pages. She Really needed a better editor.
B000FZESY4|5.0|When I first listened to Opeth's Ghost Reveries, I was blown away by the level of maturity and musicianship the band had reached. I have also been equally impressed with Blackwater Park, Deliverance, Damnation, and every other Opeth album I have ever devoted my time to. <br /> <br />I was slightly hesitant to buy this special edition disc because I thought it may be a ploy by Roadrunner to cash in on their new prospect--especially after reading the negative reviews of the bonus track \\"Soldier of Fortune.\\" <br /> <br />First of all, I am very impressed with the documentary. Clocking in at more than forty minutes, the documentary provides a peek into Mikael Akerfeldt's thoughts for the future and reminisces of the past. There is very little mention of Martin Axenrot, but more of Martin Lopez's mental issues are exposed in this documentary. Perhaps I was reading into his body language too much, but Martin seemed to achieve the lost look and unfocused swagger that only a truly depressed person can manage during his in-session footage. This documentary picks up very well to where the documentary on \\"Lamentations\\" ended. <br /> <br />The 5.1 mix of the CD is also well done. If you have stereo equipment capable of playing this format, this is another great aspect of this special edition CD. <br /> <br />The cover of Deep Purple's \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" makes a little more sense (at least to me) after watching the documentary where Mikael proclaims his newly-discovered love for the keyboards and his \\"clean\\" voice. I personally like the song even though it does not necessarily fit into the traditional sense of what an Opeth song should sound like. Just listen to it with an open mind... <br /> <br />If you do not own \\"Ghost Reveries,\\" I would definitely start with this special edition. If you already own the regular version and are a fan of Opeth, pick this disc up for the documentary alone... The video to \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" is slightly interpretative, but it didn't add alot of value for me. <br /> <br />If you found this review helpful (or not) please vote below: <br />
B000FS9FCG|5.0|V for Vendetta is an extremely entertaining movie, with a dark character seeking revenge on individuals that deformed him while the government was doing plague research.  His severe burns are the primary reason he wears a mask.  In addition - the main character V (Hugo Weaving) uses extreme acts of violence to encourage anarchy with the public, with the intent to encourage the reversal of laws that have virtually eliminated personal freedom and expression.<br /><br />Similiar to many revenge type movies, V is an intellegent, strong and extremely wealthy individual, and leaves you with the sense that he is mildy disturbed.<br /><br />While pursuing his revenge, V falls in love with Evey (Natalie Portman), and she experiences his passion directly and indirectly.  Evey is not sure whether to love him or fear him.<br /><br />The setting is future England (2020), and is not overly futuristic.  Some of the scenes can be described as extremely violent, but in an artistic way.

B000JJRIN4|4.0|Gwen Stefani is one of the most exciting artists working in the mainstream. She oozes style in just about everything she does, while her music is consistently innovative and always inventive. <br />The former No Doubt lead singer showed with her debut solo album \\"Love Angel Music Baby\\" that she had what it takes to compete at the forefront of the mainstream scene, mixing it capably with the likes of Madonna, Pink and Beyonce yet delivering things in a style that was distinctly her own. <br />Sophomore album \\"The Sweet Escape\\" maintains those high standards and proves that her debut was no fluke. It's a fantastic listen, capable of widespread crossover appeal and almost certain to fall prey to flattering imitations. <br />It impresses from the outset, kicking off with the brilliant lead single \\"Wind It Up\\" and tossing in one hit after another in a number of different styles. <br />\\"Wind It Up\\", in particular, is a highlight that's sure to become a signature tune for the artist. With its cheeky \\"Sound Of Music\\" sample wrapped around a more distinct tub-thumping beat (think \\"Hollaback Girl\\"), it's an absolute riot of energy that appeals to the childlike dancer in every one of us. You'll be foot-tapping and hip-swaying along with its infectious energy in spite of any reservations you may feel. But it's Stefani's gift that she can take something that, on paper, sounds cheesy and make it utterly, utterly cool. <br />Thereafter, it's a thrilling and eclectic mix packed with the usual smattering of high-profile collaborations - but crucially, with some surprise additions. <br />Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley provides a telling contribution to \\"Early Winter\\", a thrilling keyboard-based ballad that finds Stefani at her most intimate and lovely, while Akon's distinct rapping style works well on the album's title track, the thrilling \\"Sweet Escape\\". <br />\\"4 In The Morning\\" is another heart-melter of a track, a slow-burner built around some lush electronic soundscapes, a swooning set of vocals and some well-realised strings. It's one for the romantically inclined and a track that serves as a nice contrast to the more boisterous, semi-rap style of dancefloor fillers such as \\"Now That You Got It\\" and \\"Orange County Girl\\". <br />Another highlight is the high-tempo, percussion heavy \\"Yummy\\", a duet with Pharrell that finds Stefani at her most sassy and, well, yummy vocally. It drops in a sample of \\"Wind It Up\\" but in no way feels like a lazy retread of former hits. The chorus, too, provides an example of the artist pushing the pop boundaries to pleasing effect. <br />The same applies to the effortlessly hip vibe surrounding \\"Fluorescent\\", another contagious offering that gets better and better the more you hear it, and the dark, grinding \\"Breakin' Up\\", which finds the singer at her most feisty and defiant. Both tracks hint at the new directions taken by both Madonna and Nelly Furtado, albeit with Stefani's distinct spin. <br />There's a sweet '80s vibe surrounding final track \\"Wonderful Life\\" that's also engaging, while the live version of \\"Wind It Up\\" that brings things to a close is utterly enchanting. <br />Like we said, this is an inspirational piece of work that makes Stefani's artistic brilliance impossible to escape. Our advice is to shell out and enjoy - it's one of the hippest releases of the year.Jack Foley. <br />Rating: 4.5 out of 5
B00081912E|5.0|I am not a big fan of Jim Carrey, animation mixed with live action, or Cameron Diaz.  Despite all this, The Mask is a favorite of mine and gets five stars because of a series of intangibles I'll list below:<br /><br />1.  Attitude.  This movie never takes itself too seriously.  Its sole reason for exisiting is to have fun and make you laugh.  I think some movies acquire an \\"attitude\\" that can permeate all of the performances and seep into the experience of the viewer.  This was definitely the case here.  Kudos to the Director and the entire cast and crew, who made this film experience a good time and alot of laughs from beginning to end!<br /><br />2.  Supporting Cast.  Like all great comedies, the supporting cast has a big if not bigger role than the \\"name\\" comedian.  From Art Carney and Audrey Meadows in the Honeymooners, to Jason Alexander and Julia Dreyfuss in Seinfeld.  In the Mask, I particularly loved the performances of Peter Riegert as the Leutenant, Richard Jeni as Stanley's pal, and of course, that Russel Terrier as Milo.  Great performance by Milo as he swims away with the mast in the last scene.<br /><br />3.  Song and Dance.  Many reviewers overlook this fabulous part of the Mask.  The dancing is fantastic, from Stanley's dance with Cameron's character at the Coco Bongo Club, to the fabulous \\"Cuban Pete\\" extravaganza in the street out side the park.  Outstanding.  The soundtrack definitely enhanced the movie for me.<br /><br />4.  The story line.  I don't know why so many reviewers thought the plot was lame.  It worked for me.<br /><br />Anyway, don't discount this movie if you aren't a Jim Carrey fan.  Rent it, sit back and relax.  You'll enjoy it.
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins has taken it upon himself to stand up against religion and for a scientific rationalism that denies the existence of God.  He's a chesty, table-thumping kind of arguer, quick with a quip and armed with an impressive arsenal of facts.  Hardcore atheists will cheer him on, those straddling the Deist/Agnostic fence might be persuaded one way or another, and the Theists will stay rooted right where they are.<br /><br />The biggest problem for Theists, who postulate the presence of a loving, benevolent God deeply involved in our personal affairs, is to rationalize away all the evil and suffering in the world.  Great energy gets expended on these rationalizations, but, in the end, there's more sophistry than compelling proof.  For atheists such as Dawkins, the biggest challenge is to explain how the universe got here in the first place, and to explain how the improbable mix of physical and chemical occurrences that began 14 billion years ago with the Big Bang led eventually to us.<br /><br />Dawkins' response is a variant of the old Catholic schoolboy retort, \\"Well, then, who made God?\\"  He argues that you can't use a more complex phenomenon (God) to explain a less complex phenomenon (the origin of the universe).  As he puts it at another point, when he's refuting the notion of intelligent design, \\"The higher the implausibility, the more implausible design becomes.\\"  Because God is more complex and more implausible that the universe he created, there can be no God.  But this mixes two diverging issues.  Darwinian natural selection does explain the improbable evolution of life forms on this planet, and does refute the theory of Intelligent Design as an explanation of life on this planet.  There isn't a corresponding theory in physics to explain where that infinitely dense core of matter that blew outward and got this universe started came from in the first place, so physics doesn't refute God.<br /><br />If Dawkins is going to argue, as he does, that nothing theological should be out of bounds to scientific inquiry, then science has to have a reasonable explanation for first causes.  It doesn't.  This doesn't mean that God is the correct answer, but science bereft of a plausible, repeatable solution to a carefully crafted hypothesis isn't the crushing response to the question of whether God exists that Dawkins envisions.  To say that God can't be the answer because it's not a scientific answer is about as persuasive as the old religious argument that every new scientific discovery is simply further proof of God's grand design.<br /><br />After he's put this refutation of God on the table, he goes on to take a few whacks at organized religion, which deserves it, and quotes Sam Harris approvingly on the craziness of biblical literalism.  Dawkins also argues that the religious impulse and the psychological foundations of morality probably had survival value and can be explained in Darwinian terms; here he is on the firm ground of his own expertise.  He also defends his strenuous objecting to organized religion on the grounds that religion is not only not beneficent, it's positively harmful to human progress.  For this assertion, unfortunately, he has a lot of evidence on his side.  Finally, he makes an eloquent plea to not force children into a Faith without giving them a chance to grow up and figure out what they truly believe.<br /><br />One of the standard ripostes to atheists is that Hitler and Stalin were atheists.  According to Dawkins, Hitler probably wasn't, but the comment is absurd anyway, because it's impossible to isolate their atheism from the other aspects of their personality that made them commit horrible acts.  But this taunt contains the germ of an interesting argument.  Whether or not they believed in God, what Hitler and Stalin actually did was to unhook the definitions of what constituted moral acts from the traditions that defined morality for the majority of their countrymen.  They claimed to speakfor a higher truth and used the gulag and the gas chamber as truth's enforcing agent.  This is an unintended consequence of scientific, atheistic rationalism: truth can be severed from traditional morality and ethics.  Once severed, it can be combined with moral zealotry of any kind, including Hitler and Stalin's kind, take away human freedom.  When this happens, perverted scientific rationalism becomes the flip side of the religious zealotry from which it claims to be rescuing us; either way, blood will run in the streets.<br /><br />The real challenge, then, is not to refute Darwin or Jesus, even through we're spending a lot of energy on that these days.  The real challenge is to figure out how to maintain our individual freedom and individual agency while participating successfully in communal human endeavors.  I'd suggest looking for answers not from priests, who have something to gain from our credulity, and not from biologists, because the scientific method isn't that effective in analyzing and predicting group behavior.  We should go back to the political philosophers such as Locke, Montesquieu, Polanyi and Hayek, who thought hard and well about the mechanisms needed to keep the individual from being crushed by the herd.claimed to speak for a higher truth and used the gulag and the gas chamber as truth's enforcing agent.

B000IHY9SE|5.0|This album caught me COMPLETELY by surprise. I mean...Eminem is one of the most talented artists, PERIOD! I knew he we group together a killer squad, but DAMN! Honestly, I would usually skip the tracks that would have Bizarre on them, but I DIDN'T SKIP \\"Murder\\"!!! All of Eminem, D12, Obie Trice, 50 Cent, Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater, Cashis, etc. held SHADY/AFTERMATH correct!!!! If this is what I'm to expect with the rest of what's to come from these artists, I will be satisfied for years to come. This album, no matter WHAT th'f#ck people say about its format, is one of my favorites of 2006, and I MEAN THAT!!!!! I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANY SHADY/AFTERMATH FAN! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I just loved this movie.  It was funny in a way that felt true and good.  The characters were all perfectly flawed and loveable.  I recommended this movie to everyone I knew without regard to their age or taste levels (my parents, even!).  I saw this in the theater with my brother and we pitched such a fit during the scene with the horn.  I laughed harder in a public place than I have in years.  Laughter that was hoarse and breathless and embarassing.  All around, the best movie I have seen in 2006.  You'll love it!
B00006CXSS|5.0|My grandfather, now 87, was in 506th Easy Company. He was a BAR man. The truely do not make them like my grandfather anymore. I have watched this series and it really fills in the blanks about what my grandfather went through during that war. I have heard quite a few stories from him, through the years. What I saw in the series echos his accounts. He has no interest in watching the series, however, due to the fear of it bringing back too many memories of that time. One story he told me is that of guarding the German officers tent of Field Marshal Kessellring and others during their surrender. As Kessellring and the other officers were allowed to keep their sidearms, when under American capture, Kessellring handed my grandfather his Luger as he exited the officer's tent after formally surrendering. I am buying this series for my 16 year old nephew for Christmas, as he requested. That this very well done depiction of WWII even affects the young should say something about those days.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I waited a few months to buy this album because of all the hype.  It was on all of these Best of 2005 lists.  I mean, Rolling Stone.  Not usually a mark in the Pro category for me.  I'm a snobby indie music lover.  I don't want anything mainstream!  But, I eventually caved in.  Just like I eventually read those crack-laden Harry Potter novels.  And, yes, there is a reason Illinoise made so many lists.  It's good.  Really good.  I've had it almost a year now and I'm not sick of it.  I've listened to it a lot, yet the songs still surprise me from time to time.  It calms me down, cheers me up, keeps my mind busy, fires me up...all from track to track.  I have never regretted buying this CD.  I just regret not owning it as soon as I could have.  Buy it now, you won't look back.

I shall not go out of my way to offend, but nor shall I don kid gloves to handle religion any more gently that I would handle anything else.\\"<br /><br />The above is found in the first chapter's last paragraph of scientist Professor Richard Dawkins amazing, easy to read book.  Throughout this book (contrary to what other reviewer's state) what Dawkins does is delve into some aspect of religion's past (mainly Christianity), analyze what is said, and then he comes to a rational and reasoned conclusion.<br /><br />To give the potential reader a \\"feel\\" for the book, I shall give the title of each chapter (in upper case) and an actual thought-provoking statement from each chapter:<br /><br />(1) A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS NON-BELIEVER.  \\"I [that is, Dawkins] am intrigued and mystified by the disproportionate privileging of religion in our otherwise secular societies.\\"<br /><br />(2) THE GOD HYPOTHESIS. \\"I have yet to see any good reason to suppose that theology (as opposed to biblical history, literature, etc.) is a subject at all.\\"<br /><br />(3) ARGUMENTS FOR GOD'S EXISTENCE.  \\"The higher one's intelligence or education level, the less one is likely to be religious or hold `beliefs' of any kind.\\"<br /><br />(4) WHY THERE ALMOST CERTAINLY IS NO GOD.  \\"One of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding...If you don't understand how something works, never mind: just give up and say God did it.\\"<br /><br />(5) THE ROOTS OF RELIGION.  \\"We observe large numbers of people...who hold beliefs that flatly contradict demonstrable scientific facts.\\"<br /><br />(6) THE ROOTS OF MORALITY: WHY ARE WE GOOD?  \\"Research evidence...certainly doesn't support the common view that religiosity is positively correlated with morality.\\"<br /><br />(7) THE `GOOD' BOOK AND THE CHANGING MORAL ZEITGEIST [spirit of the times].  \\"Religious wars really are fought in the name of religion, and they have been horribly frequent in history.  I cannot think of any war that has been fought in the name of atheism.\\"<br /><br />(8) WHAT'S WRONG WITH RELIGION?  WHY BE SO HOSTILE?  \\"As a scientist, I am hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise.  It teaches us not to change our minds, and not to want to know exciting things that are available to be known.

[that is, does religion fill a much needed gap?]  \\"The atheist view is correspondingly life-affirming and life-enhancing, while at the same time never being tainted with self-delusion, wishful thinking, or the...self-pity of those who feel that life owes them something.\\"<br /><br />What makes this book especially easy to read is that each chapter is divided into sections.  Here are the sections for chapter three:<br /><br />(1) Thomas Aquinas' `proofs'  (2) the ontological argument and other a priori arguments (3) the argument from beauty (4) the argument from personal `experience'  (5) the argument from scripture (6) the argument from admired religious scientists (7) Pascal's wager (8) Bayesian arguments.<br /><br />This book is filled with historical quotations from prominent people.  One of my favorites is by philosopher and Nobel laureate Bertrand Russell (1872 to 1970):<br /><br />\\"The immense majority of intellectually eminent [people] disbelieve in Christian religion, but they conceal the fact in public, because they are afraid of losing their incomes.\\"<br /><br />There are two things in this book that really stood out for me:<br /><br />(1) Dawkins includes a section on hate mail sent not only to him but to others who value reason and rationality.  I couldn't believe the gruesome content of these letters. All these letters were sent by believers in God.<br /><br />(2) Dawkins describes the people still being ruthlessly killed in the name of religion.  And this is the twenty-first century!!<br /><br />The only problem with this book is that it is long.  Personally, this did not bother me.  However, the people who should read it in its entirety will probably not read it from cover to cover because of its length.  This is truly a pity.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book in a nutshell delves into supernatural religion and contrasts it with the reason and rationality of science.  I leave you with another of my favorite quotations found in this book by comedian George Carlin:<br /><br />\\"Religion has actually convinced [many] people that there's an invisible man--living in the sky--who watches everything you do, every minute of every day.  And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do.  And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever `til the end of time...But He loves you!\\"<br /><br />(first published 2006;  10 chapters;  main narrative 375 pages;  appendix;  books cited;  notes;  index)<br /><br />+++++te mail sent not only to him but to others who value reason and rationality.

0553208845|5.0|This novel like any historical novel captures the essence of a certain orientation toward life.  While it is not necessarily historically accurate in terms of portraying the Buddha's life, it certainly captures the spirit of his quest and the existential crisis that lead to the Buddha's renunciation.<br /><br />If you read a good book on Buddhism such as Huston Smith's you will definitely learn more about Buddhism and get a sense of the heart of this path.  However, this book captures something more poetic that only can come across in well-written fiction.  It is certainly a nice compliment to other more objective looks at Buddhism at a minimum.<br /><br />Also, other reviewers are quite right to point out that in the end Siddhartha finds a resolution to his crisis as an intact self.  In reality, Buddhism posits the concept of \\"no self\\" or inherent existence.  In addition, the end point of Hinayana (Therevada) Buddhism is a state called Nirvana which literally means to \\"blow out\\" as if one were a candle.  The implication is that the self disappears in the way a wave might return to the ocean.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great short novel that is not a literal interpretation of the Buddha's life.  However, it is inspired by his life and it does capture the energy and motivation for his search for truth.  It also does a decent job of providing an inside look at an Eastern point of view.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|To be honest, I was never much of a \\"Miami Vice\\" fan when it was on TV. Even as a teenager, it was apparent to me that it was trying way too hard and that, frankly, it was all pretty silly.<br /><br />Well, Michael Mann grew up and his characters put on socks. And in probably an inevitable move, he came back to \\"Miami Vice.\\" The film incarnation does not have much of a connection to the television series, for good or for ill, but more of a successor to \\"Heat,\\" \\"Ronin\\" and \\"Collateral,\\" with insanely gorgeous (digital video) cinematography is its biggest asset.<br /><br />Worth a watch for Michael Mann's modern film work. It'll probably just be frustrating for hardcore fans of the television show, though.
0140187650|4.0|The most serious flaw in this work is the lack of detail provided about Eichmann himself.  For a book where Eichmann is the central character, it is surprising how little time Arendt devotes to the man himself.  Of course, the larger picture of the Nazi killing of the Jews must be provided, but it seems Arednt errs too closely on the macro side, leaving aside the micro.  Her propensity to study mass, totalitarian movements left her little prepared to write a biography, or report on a trial of one man.   <br /> <br />That said, there are some wonderful passages of analysis here, well worth tackling.  You can sense Arednt's simmering resentment at every turn, and her spite and rage are a strange pleasure to read.  In a world where moral categories are too often drawn in strict black and white, Arednt in Eichmann in Jerusalem was not afraid to write a book almost entirely in gray.

B000002LGQ|5.0|Most Madonna fans and critics in general seem to think that her 2 best albums are 1989's Like a Prayer and 1998's Ray of Light.  They are correct in this opinion.  But people seem to go back and forth on which of these releases is the better of the 2.<br /><br />I've always gone with Like a Prayer.  This album not only represents her most serioues artistic achievment it also exhibits a timeless quality that has caused the album to age better than anything else in her entire extensive catalog.<br /><br />First of all, Madonna and the producers/musicians decided to record most of all the band/vocal tracks live in the studio at the same time, which gives the album a true live feel. It also makes this her most organic sounding release as well.  The synthesizer stuff from her earlier albums is minimized and in it's place are more basic/stripped down instrumentations.  But that's not to say this album is anything basic. They also use to great effect gospel choirs and even Prince makes a guest appearance on vocals on 1 tracks and guitar on that track and 2 others.  Strings and other great additions really add to the proceedings without clogging the work at hand.<br /><br />I realize that Madonna has never been viewed as a great lyricist, but on this album in particular shows her reaching deep down in a sprititual/artistic sense that stunned/silenced her critics/detractors at the time who claimed that she still didn't have any talent whatsoever.  This is her most personal work and the topics range from her talking to God, referring to her fatherly abuse she suffered growing up, penning an ode to her at-the-time recently deceased mother and other personal topics.  But the lyrics never become pretentious in any fashion and also seem more of a celabratory angle thanks to the vocal delivery as well as the backing music.<br /><br />The musical styles also run the gamut from gospel to dance to funk to rock and pure pop.  But the album still mantains a cohesive feel.<br /><br />While Madonna's first 3 albums have seen recently to get the remastering treatment, Like a Prayer on the other hand was her first work to be completely digitally recorded. while the overall volume level is a tad lower than newer CD's, it still sounds great. But I wonder why Warner Bros. didn't just go ahead and remaster this release as well to slightly boost the volume/lows like on the other 3 remasters (Live a Virgin, True Blue and Madonna).<br /><br />Even though it's understandable that many people don't view Madonna as a true artist due to how her offstage antics seem to constantly overshadow her music. People forget how much truly great music this constantly amazing woman has produced.  One listen to this album will silence anyone who have doubts as to her as a true artist.<br /><br />When she really puts her mind to it, this album in addition to Ray of Light show that this woman really can make some albums that transcend being simply great/state-of-the-art pop into the world of true art.> <br />While Madonna's first 3 albums have seen recently to get the remastering treatment, Like a Prayer on the other hand was her first work to be completely digitally recorded. while the overall volume level is a tad lower than newer CD's, it still sounds great.

B000059T1E|5.0|This actually started out as going to be Steve Winwood's first solo album. Traffic had broken up when Steve left to join Blind Faith and Dave Mason left for his solo career. When Blind Faith fell apart Winwood went into the studio to record his first solo album. Both Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi were originally only going to be making guest appearences. However, it worked out so well that Traffic was reborn. Listening to this cd it's easy to see why they decided to give it a go again. This is a great album all the way through and is the strongest overall album that they had put out at that point in time. From the jazzy feel of Glad and Freedom Rider to the british folk of John Barleycorn, this IS one that belongs in everyone's collection.
B0000C1733|5.0|Let me start by saying...WOW! This is one the greatest compilation albums ever created by any artists anywhere. There is not one bad or even mediocre song from beginning to end. If you are a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or you just happen to like California music more than the rest, then this is a perfect choice for your C.D. collection. All of the more popular songs are here, as well as some incredible songs that have not been played on the radio. The sound quality is awesome, and the liner notes and photos are just too cool. I really got a buzz off of the last song on the album, which is called \\"Save the population\\". It is beautiful, and it could make a difference in the way a lot of peolple view their own ideas about love. I have to say that as time goes by, The Red Hot Chili Peppers have only gotten better at writing songs that really mean something to people all over the world. Even my friends in the Philippines love this band! Absoulutely Five stsrs, and I say this album is a Perfect Ten! Hell Yeah!
B000001FV1|5.0|Traffic's Shoot Out At The Fantasy Factory was recorded in late '72 and released in February '73. The was the first album to feature David Hood and Roger Hawkins who had joined the band on the tour for Low Spark. The album starts out in fine form with the high spirited title track. Roll Right Stones is a long reflective song pondering the meaning of life. The second half opens with the sweet ballad Evening Blue. Chris Wood turns in a great instrumental song called Tragic Magic. The album ends with (Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired which is anything BUT uninspired. The original album had been edited a few years after it came out When Traffic submitted a reworked master with Uninspired fading out early and Roll Right Stones missing a whole 2 minutes as well as a slightly different mix. All previous cd releases were from that master. This version is the first to restore this classic album to it's full glory.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Incubus is an alternative metal band that was formed in 1991 by Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Alex Katunich, and Jose Pasillas when they were in the 10th grade. After adding a few additional members, they released their first full length album, S.C.I.E.N.C.E., in 1997. With subsequent releases, combined with extensive touring, they were able to build up a lot of support and a devoted fan base. Light Grenades is their first album in almost 3 years.<br /><br />Their last album, A Crow Left of Murder, found the band getting much heavier with their music and lyrics. While the album did garner good reviews, it wasn't accepted wholeheartedly by their fan base. This album builds on their previous one, but they sound much sharper and focused. The album, like much of their previous work, still has a somber tone, but they sound much more adept at adding variety to their music than they have in the past. This has helped them craft another high quality album. Their growth and focus shows on tracks like Anna Molly, Earth to Bella, and Creep. The most surprising track is Diamonds and Coal, a track that has a pop sound to it. It's unexpected to have a band that is usually so somber come out with a pop track, but it is an example of how much the band has matured since their debut.<br /><br />This is another solid album by the band. They're the rare band that consistently puts out one solid release after the next, and this one is no exception. It's a great showcase or their growth and versatility, and is an indication that there are probably even bigger and better things to come in the future.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is a beautiful story, beautifully told.  I thought both Reeves and Bullock played their parts superbly. Suspend your disbelief, don't search for flaws, and above all accept that such relationships don't only happen in Hollywood.  Highly uplifting.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|First off, it really doesn't matter how good a film looks and sounds if it sucks!  That being said, Batman Begins HD DVD delivers both the quality plot and the quality format.<br /><br />I'm sure you have heard about how great this movie is, so I won't spend much time on that.  It is by far the best of the Batman franchise.<br /><br />Why you are probably reading this review is to find out about the HD DVD format quality--is it all it is hyped to be?  If you have to go out and spend $1500 on a good HDTV and $1000 for a HD DVD player (or Blu-Ray for other titles), my answer is \\"no.\\"  In all other cases (you already have some of the pieces e.g. HDTV, Xbox 360 + HD DVD) then assuradely \\"yes!\\"<br /><br />There are several scenes that are just jaw-dropping, including my favorite scene in Gotham near the end (no spoilers here).  The quality is as good as others have hyped, both for the Title and for the format.<br /><br />When I first popped it in, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality--but then I realized that my wife had changed the TV settings to her brighter preferences for video games.  A couple of adjustments, and presto!  Be sure to double check your settings, too--they make a huge difference.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|I'm no expert and I do not know if this is truly the first \\"slasher\\" flick, but I did notice alot of other aspects that have been borrowed by other horror gems throughout the years. Being the more youthful horror buff that Hollywood seems to try to cater to, I am happy to say that this film manages to make many of the modern slasher flicks seem tame.  <br />Yes, this film is an older one... and yes, some of the acting mimics that time (which seemed mostly follwing the addage \\"let the clothes and hair act for you...\\") but this film had some rather decent and jarring moments.  <br />The first obscene phone call is one of those highlights as it gets nasty and the \\"girls\\" all seem facinated yet mortified by what is being said. Then there is a scene later when one of the girls gets a \\"frightening\\" glimpse of the killer that not only scared her but scared me as well. That eye, man... it was that freaky eye.  <br />I am glad I finally broke down and bought this thrilling number and I can tell you right now that the upcomming remake will undoubtedly fail at comming close to matching the thrills and chills of this gem. (I'll still see it though... but I'm wary)  <br />A few plot holes aside and a \\"say what\\" ending that was supposed to be more ominous in tone than it turned out to be, this is a Christmas worth witnessing despite its dark and frightening under-currents.
0307346609|4.0|What really sets this book apart is the believability of it.  Once you get past the odd premise of the dead rising to consume the living, it seems like a perfectly plausible history.  Brooks captures how the modern world would respond to the catastrophe.  The stories range from wrenching tales of refugees trying to survive in desperate conditions to the military, and governments, to the soldiers on the front lines.  The book follows a loose chronology starting with the first outbreak, to the initial panic to the final turning of the tide.  Some of the stories are a bit weak, but over all it's a very compelling and addictive read.  Of course he has a lot of great material to borrow from in the Romero zombie movies, but he really takes it to a new and amazing level.  And in the tradition of Romero, Brooks uses the zombie motiff to take jabs at modern society, especially  the immobility of our corrupt political system, and the press.  Anyone who is a fan of zombie movies, horror, or science fiction should read it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Man O' man! What a show!  Not a typical space shoot-em-up (but there is some of that) or a droll dragged out trek through space.  It's unique, funny and catchy.  Be forewarned that some subjects might not be suitable for young ones.   <br /> <br />For the life of me I can't believe that this one was cancelled.  This is a series that REALLY needs to be resurrected.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|I never thought that there could be a musical genre even more worthless than nu-metal. Emo music is the new \\"abomination\\" of commercialized garbage that is sold to the youth of America. There is nothing worthwhile on this disc. Ultimately, these CD's are only destined for two places -- the landfill and/or one of those horrible compilation discs of rehashed garbage (like the best hits of the 80's). There is nothing of value in this music... It simply sells an identity and a sense of belonging to bored suburban teenagers. In the end, there is not much of a difference between emo and nu-metal. Both genres wallow in self-pity and put an emphasis on unreality and self-absorption. Rock music used to simply be about hedonism. Nowadays it is about personal drama and self-pity. Oh, look at me... look at my problems... Being \\"dark\\" and writing whiny lyrics has been equated with art nowadays, but there is nothing original and/or artistic about it. It is simply what it is -- corporate rock. So, when you drag your parents down to the local hot topics, just think... what am I really buying into here? Those gosh darn preps... Maybe you should realize that there is no difference between this music and the likes of Brittany Spears. You are just the \\"alternative\\" target audience.
B00005221M|5.0|I've loved this film since first seeing it upon its premiere in late 1992; the Director's Expanded Edition (albeit there are only a few extra minutes of footage) only makes the whole experience better, if possible.  If you're a fan of good Westerns, you'll love this \\"Eastern,\\" set in 1757 in western New York (the colony, at that time), along the Hudson River valley, although it was actually filmed in beautiful western North Carolina, on the Biltmore House Estate, in Chimney Rock Park, etc. <br /> <br />Great performances all around, genuine historical characters (Col. Munro, the Marquis de Montcalm, and several others), real battle sites (Ft. William Henry), authentic weaponry, everything a student of the French & Indian War (or the Seven Years' War, if you prefer) could want.  The manner of speech, the costumes, the settings, all very realistic and as historic as possible (which is one reason they filmed in NC:  too many cars, planes, power lines, etc., even in western New York state, for the director to have the silence and untouched natural settings necessary for making a movie set in the late 1750's). <br /> <br />Possibly the best performance is by Wes Studi, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the following year, but did not win (he certainly should have) as Magwa.  Studi is a Cherokee, but he more than \\"passes\\" as the Huron turned Mohawk, with black vengeance in his heart for Col. Munro (and his daughters!).  Russell Means and Eric Schweig are also brilliant.  Michael Mann deserves credit for making the American Indian characters just as important as the \\"white\\" leading characters (Nathaniel/Hawkeye, Cora Munro, et al.). <br /> <br />Watch the film (presuming you've been living in a cave the last 14 years since its release and haven't yet seen it) in widescreen only, on a big TV if possible, with the best resolution you can get -- stunningly beautiful photography of breathtaking scenery.  Good speakers are important, too (the film won the Sound awards at the Oscars).  Just sit back and let it wash over you!  Let any glitches (and there aren't many) just go by -- stick with the flow of the story, the great settings, the experience of virtually living in 1757, and you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!
B00005JPCA|5.0|After my 4th weekend of seeing Bond (I am going for a personal record) I still find things in this film which I had missed the first three times around. Gritty, tough and tender - like the new Bond himself - this film packs a punch and then some. <br /> <br />If there was any question about whether Daniel Craig could fill Bond's shoes (and after seeing him in Layer Cake I had no doubts at all), that answer is a resounding YES. In fact, he has become the leader of the pack in my eyes as he brings a refreshing quality to the role and to the man. <br /> <br />The best scenes by far are when Craig shares screen time with Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen. Having seen some great card films like Rounders, I can say that the gaming shots are as tense and tight as anything put on film. <br /> <br />Green brings intelligence and depth to her role. And she is well matched by Craig. <br /> <br />Judy Dench, having more to do than set up Bond for another endless quip, brings a new insight and almost motherly aspect to M. Seeing M at home was a treat and seeing her out of her office was a joy. This award-winning actress finally had dialogue equal to her talent. <br /> <br />Is this the best Bond film ever? Many will disagree and I must admit the Connery Bond was as suave and sophisticated as they come, but Craig has brought a human quality to Bond. We feel his pain, we understand the walls he has errected, and we believe in his values. He makes mistakes, he takes his hits, but ultimately, he is a hero worth cheering for. <br /> <br />I for one will be cheering again and again at the theater and cannot wait to see what Mr. Craig has in store for us upon Bond's return.
B000HIVO64|4.0|This is decisively a better album than \\"Guero\\" but at the same time, it doesn't quite rank at the same level that Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" did a few years ago. It's got a very psychedelic feel to it which is infused with electronic beats in the best style of \\"Guero\\" and \\"O'Delay\\" and the first nine songs hold up very well in great Beck fashion. But towards \\"Motorcade\\" the album starts to go down a spiral that is unlike his other great works.<br /><br />Towards the end, \\"The Information\\" looses steam and focus, becoming the equivalent to a self-talking lunatic walking down a dark alley. When you consider the last song lasts well over 10 minutes and the complete album is a little longer than an hour, you realize you are in front of a good 45 minutes of great music, with fifteen minutes of odd padding wrapping things up in the end.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|I know, I know there are alot of Doors box sets out there but this one tops them all by a long shot! <br /> <br />There are extended versions of songs like Love her Madly, Hello I love you, L.A.Woman, to name a few. <br /> <br />Surround sound brings out voices and instruments that were not there with the regular releases, the speed of the music is finally corrected. <br /> <br />You get 12 disc for $119.00 or $9.91 a disc and a very nice box set itself! <br /> <br />Whay a great holiday gift!

B000ICM5MG|5.0|Rocky has finally received the respect it deserves.   This is not just a movie, it is a powerful play.   Better than anything written by Shakespeare.  It's everything wrapped into one movie.   This is my fourth copy on DVD.  I can't just own one of this movie, it's that good.  MGM gave us a good release with this one, with some excellent commentary.
0143036556|5.0|Jared Diamond has done it again.  In each new book he writes, Professor Diamond achieves a greater depth of insight and spread of scope.  The author has built on a theme that began with \\"The Third Chimpanzee,\\" an excellent account of the evolutionary history of humanity.  His next major work, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" won the Pulitzer, and is a larger look at the socio-historical forces that have shaped the contemporary globe, namely the dominance of Western culture due to a mastery of firearms, domestic animals and their diseases, and iron.  \\"Collapse\\" will probably garner Professor Diamond another Pulitzer, as the scope of the work is immensely scholarly, and the book was not assembled from an armchair, but from actual experience in the field.  The author has visited two of the locales in his book over the span of several decades, and he writes with authority about both Montana and New Guinea.  Beginning in Montana, Mr. Diamond applies his five-point framework to a modern U.S. state, detailing the startling ecological damage in what he reveals is one of the least-damaged states.  He then studies the more well-known Easter Island collapse, and throws in a chapter on the far lesser known aboriginal inhabitants of Pitcairn and Henderson Islands.    The multi-disciplinary approach Professor Diamond brings to bear is impeccable, there is ample analysis of tree rings and weather patterns, soil erosion, archaeology, anthropology, and packrat middens.  Also covered in detail are the Anasazi, Maya, Vikings in Greenland, and modern China, Australia, Iceland, and Rwanda.  Diamond's combined analysis paints a picture that is difficult to refute, despite some particular expert's critique of his Mayan study.  You may be able to debate Professor Diamond on a minor detail, but the broadside of fact and analysis covering a dozen cultures over three thousand years is remarkable.  Mr. Diamond has visited every site under study, and if anyone were to seriously consider challenging his conclusions, and were to similarly visit and analyze each locale and then present their own conclusions, they would be setting themselves a task of at least twenty years.    As a work of history alone, \\"Collapse\\" is a remarkable book, but it also turns out to be the best environmentalist work in years, and cogently presents both the problems, and many of the solutions.
B00006AFF5|5.0|I've been a fan of Jim Carrey's version since it came out. I've burned through several VHS copies and now several DVD copies. My grandkitten doesn't care for Christmas and manages to destroy a DVD. I do subject the whole family to it. <br />I just LOVE the town of Whoville and all of the Who's. Cindy Lou is beyond adorable and the movie set is so beautifully crafted. The story is cute and Jim Carrey adds his own personality to the character making it a truely unique Christmas Classic. <br />
B000FL7CAK|4.0|I loved the first season of \\"Veronica Mars\\", and ultimately loved season two, as well.  As I progressed through the season, though, there was a little cattiness and sneering amid the love.  Why?  Ah, just some small things...<br /><br />A coffee house?  Veronica now works in a freakin' coffee house?  It just felt like a cheesy attempt to make the show feel a little more like all the other youth dramas out there.  The development wasn't totally horrible, but we could have lived without it.<br /><br />Some choppiness.  Characters and situations were introduced and dropped with little or no explanation.  Why exactly did Wallace have to leave for several episodes to be with his dad if little was done with the idea?  And was there ANY explanation for Veronica's dad and Wallace's mom suddenly not seeing each other anymore?  If the explanation was there it was REALLY quick.<br /><br />Though still compelling, the bus crash and the \\"Is Logan guilty of murder\\" season-long plotlines weren't as immediately dramatic as the \\"Who Killed Lilly Kane?\\" plot from the previous year.  But I guess what plot arcs COULD match that great first year?<br /><br />Okay, enough ranting about the quibbles.  What was great about the season?  Lots of stuff.  Here's a sampling:<br /><br />The show was as clever as always.  I loved one episode where Veronica was suddenly acting all soap opera-ish and heartbroken over Duncan, making me yell at the screen about how the quality of the writing had suddenly dropped into the basement.  But then we learn that there was a REASON Veronica was acting like a bad piece of melodrama from \\"90210\\".  They got me!<br /><br />Once again, the creators give us credit for being smart enough to keep up.  As in season one, the solutions to the individual stand-alone episodes are quickly rattled off and not spoon fed to us.  You have to pay attention.<br /><br />Though I felt there was more of a \\"making it up as they went along\\" feel to this season, I have to admit that the exciting and well-organized last episode once again neatly wrapped things up.  If things WERE created more on the fly during the course of this season, the writers certainly brought all the strands together in the end.<br /><br />In the end, I guess I feel that the first season of \\"Veronica Mars\\" easily leaped over the wall into \\"excellent show\\" territory and this second season had to work a little to pull itself over that wall to get into that same territory.  Hence the four-star rating instead of the five stars I gave season one.  But four stars is still nothing to sneeze at.  In other words, bring on season three.atly wrapped things up.

B0007PAMR4|1.0|most people buying this edition will be for the extended version only...and what a dismal disappointment the remastering is!  I have bought a total of 3 copies each from a different store and all share the same problems!  after chapter 8 on the dvd, it is completely unwatchable!  The dvd is riddled with artifacts, colour bleeding, and random freezes and stops!  the sound is the only salvation.  the flip side of the dvd (original version) is excellent which puzzles me to the problems plaguing the extended version.  Its obvious that there was little to no quality control in the creation of the extended version...even the disc itself is of a cheaper grade than most companies use.  Just for inquiring minds, I am not playing this on a cheap set up either, rather a 12,000$ home theatre set up hooked up with monster cables, kef speakers, xbr t.v., yamaha rxv-2095 receiver, and nakamichi dvd 10 player.   for comparison i also tried playing the dvd on a ps2 and on an inexpensive sony dvd player....all showed same problems!   I recommend that universal recalls this dvd and repair whats needed as it will annoy possibly anger alot of dune fans.    just my 2 cents.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I was beginning to wonder if James Bond was dead, but along comes Daniel Craig to breathe new life into the role, giving us a lean, mean 007 that blows previous Bonds away.  Martin Campbell went back to the basics, retooling Bond and giving him a much more physical presence, reminiscent of Sean Connery.  From the opening sequence we see we are in for a real treat, as Campbell takes nothing for granted.  He knows he has to earn the audience's respect, and he does with a thrilling chase scene in the chaotic urban center of an African republic.<br /><br />Bond really comes across as a rogue agent in Casino Royale, stealing his way into M's apartment to leave her coded messages, taking risks that threaten painstaking operations and getting himself into jams that require MI6 to bail him out.  This is a young impetuous Bond, overanxious and thrilling to watch as Craig fills his role with the energy of a stage actor.<br /><br />There is also one of the best villains in recent years with Mads Mikkelsen as the cold blooded Le Chiffre.  He heads an international cartel not so much bent on world destruction as on taking advantage of the chaos in which we live.  He is a much more believable villain than Spectre and relies on much simpler methods of getting his piece of flesh from someone.<br /><br />It is also refreshing to see Bond have a real love interest in Eva Green, not the usual banter that rings hollow.  Bond is not afraid to expose himself in this movie, revealing a much more vulnerable figure than we have seen before.<br /><br />MI6 also finds itself as a much more porous organization, capable of being infiltrated so that Bond doesn't know who to trust in key moments.  All he has is the support of M, played to deadpan perfection by Judi Dench.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is fresh and clean, including the opening credits.  Bond hasn't looked this good since the early films in the series with Sean Connery.  There is even an amusing scene where Bond wins a 1964 Aston Martin in a poker game, a tip of the hat to Goldfinger.of the hat to Goldfinger.

B00005QIY3|3.0|This is a pleasant, though obvious, adult fable, broadly hinting at the often sensual, restorative, and mystical properties of chocolate. A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile. Vianne is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest. Offended by Vianne's easy charm and her resistance to his invitation to attend church services, the mayor, whose hardened exterior hides a profound sorrow, declares war on Vianne, as he perceives her to be a threat to his established order of things.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vianne finally warms up and disarms her crotchety landlady, jumpstarts a tired marriage for two villagers, and befriends a battered woman, played with appropriate pathos, delicacy, and spirit by Lena Olin. She also manages a flirtation with an Irish drifter named Roux, well played by Johnny Depp, though they seem to lack chemistry together. She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever. Though the mayor has vowed to drive Vianne's business into the ground and run her out of town, Vianne hangs on, determined to stay until the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town. What happens in this town, however, ultimately changes the lives of its mayor, the villagers, and even Vianne, forever.<br /><br />This is a lovely, well acted, and moderately entertaining film that thematically deals with the mystical, sensual, and palliative properties of chocolate. It is a frothy, pleasant confection. If you want a film, dealing with a similar theme, that will fully satisfy an appetite, however, one need look no further than the superb film, \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\".til the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town.

0743298020|5.0|This book was one of the best I read this year.  The writing grabbed me from the beginning and the story kept me.  A story of family mystery I felt I needed to know the ending to.  A story of twins, of love, of rage.  A mystery in the present and a mystery in the past.  Diane Setterfield wove this tale together brilliantly.  I enjoyed every minute of it and can't wait until her next book.
0790729644|4.0|The dark message comes through in this Eastwood creation of classic western genre.  It is a foreboding and frightening tale of a bad man turned good then returning to his past - or is it that his past is coming back to drag him down again?  The cynicism is thick in the theme that there is no one good.  And even the bad are in for more than what they bargained for in this hard-hitting gun-slinging action drama.  If you enjoy the do-good classics, you may not like this film which is a little heavy-handed in its realism concerning the use of violence to settle scores.  Like most cynical statements, it is difficult to swallow and leaves you uneasy whether you enjoy the realism or dislike the taste it leaves behind.  The story is moving and you cannot help but uneasily relate to the main character in all his violent flaws.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Scissor Sisters makes it hard to be in a bad mood, which is ironic, given the almost lunatic tragedy that can be found in their quirky and (sometimes) indecipherable lyrics.  Of course, this band is no stranger to irony.  The lead track (and perhaps the catchiest song on this album) is a 60's glam-rock throw-back with heel-kickin' rhythms called \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'.\\"<br /><br />One could give you an idea of this group's sound by offering up the typical alchemy of band names (Supertramp + Bee Gees/Pink Floyd x Fine Young Cannibals to the power of Abba), but that's bound to be more confusing than illuminating.  It's true that the Scissor Sisters are reminiscent of the Big Hair bands and the disco-era, but let's give them their due.  They are much more than a tribute to that style, or even a reincarnation of it; they've rethought it, retooled it, and -- dare I say -- made it what it always wanted to be: simply, completely, and sincerely fun.<br /><br />\\"She's My Man,\\" with its head-scratching tale of sado-masochistic, gender-confused love ... \\"I Can't Decide,\\" a grin-inducing ditty (that almost sounds tailored for line-dancing) about a man with murderous intentions ... \\"Paul McCartney,\\" a song that is ostensibly an homage to that man's music and yet hardly sounds like anything McCartney has ever recorded ... \\"Intermission,\\" a circus-sounding, gig-box pop piece with the central line \\"we were born to die.\\"  The group has their tongue's planted firmly in their cheeks, and they're winking a mile a minute.<br /><br />What is really inspiring about this band is how almost every song, from the sweeter ballads to the slap-and-tickle dance numbers, is bound to make you snap your fingers and say, \\"I KNOW I've heard this song before.\\"  The truth is, this music really IS new.  It takes a band of true skill and aplomb to take classic and time-tested formulas and turn them into something even better.  Something that detractors might say is derivative, but is, in fact, genuinely inspired.<br /><br />I doubt, however, that the Scissor Sisters care too much if people say they're trying to revive something that was better done forty years ago, or if they're called knock-offs or copy cats, all of which is bound to happen.  Even if you're a purist who scoffs at how this album is woven with strong threads of familiarity, you cannot deny that the entire product is exciting, enjoyable, gut-bustingly fun.enuinely inspired. <br /> <br />I doubt, however, that the Scissor Sisters care too much if people say they're trying to revive something that was better done forty years ago, or if they're called knock-offs or copy cats, all of which is bound to happen.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|About once every 2 years I'll go see a movie that my girlfriend drags me to.  I've sat through eye bleeders like Legally Blonde, Runaway Bride, Serendipity and How The Grinch Stole Christmas.  I've even endured brain smashers like Maid In Manhattan, The Wedding Planner and Miss Congeniality!  So, needless to say when she told me she wanted to go see a movie called Love Actually I thought, \\"Oh, I wonder what new \\"hot\\" and \\"super-talented\\" \\"actress\\" is going to be the star of this turd.\\"  I had it all wrong!  I left the theatre happy, feeling like I got my money's worth.  The story isn't your token man/woman falls in love with man/woman, something bad happens, they overcome it and everything turns out great in the end.  Although things turn out great in the end of this movie there are so many different stories happening that you won't get bored at all.  I loved the casting too, alot of the people in this film are in other films I love! Liam Neeson in Darkman, Martin Freeman in The Office, Bill Nighy in Shaun Of The Dead, Alan Rickman in Die Hard...well, I don't really love Die Hard but I do like Rickman alot...and even though I've never liked Hugh Grant he is good in this movie. <br /> <br />So, after seeing this movie once in the theatre and about 8 times on DVD I can assure you that you'll like this movie.  It sure as heck beats Miss Congeniality!  It may even become one of those movies that you HAVE to watch when Christmas rolls around, I know it's become one of those Christmas classics for me.

B000FSME1A|4.0|I was on board with this movie the moment the Doors' number kicked in.  I wouldn't consider myself a Doors fan but Vietnam films and The Doors' music go together like Jack Daniels and my mouth.  I am 26 years old and I just watched this movie for the first time last night.  What took me so long to watch this, especially since I am a huge war film fan?  Wish I had an answer to that, but I wish I would have seen this movie along time ago.  I wish I had seen it before Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, both of those films I saw before I was ten.  I wish I had seen Apocalypse Now first so that I could compare it fairly.  Having seen Platoon and Full Metal Jacket each probably about 20 times it was hard for me not to say that this movie rips them off, even though this movie was out years before those two.  I just think that the feeling of uneasiness was made more prominent in the Kubrick and Stone masterpieces, there movies flow better too.  I can't say that I really enjoyed the movie after the point when Colonel Kurtz was found.  After Brando makes his entrance the movie feels rushed and pointless, in my opinion.  The shots where nothing happens also bothers me, stop wasting so much time and tell more story!  Anyways, I guess that is all I can complain about.  If you like Vietnam war films then watch this, it's amazing.  Every actor is great, the directing has sparks of genious mixed with shots that are subpar.  I have another wish for this film, that instead of following Captain Willard's mission we would have stayed with Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore because he stole the movie.
B000GRUS22|5.0|First, excuse me about my english, I Get the CD and when I listen to it, it was a nice feeling because if you try to focus on the chords, well enigma knows about chords. I enjoyed the album, the new path they are taking, also the arragements are, and let me tell you I know about Music because I am a pianist, great, some tracks are difficult to get it, but in general are very good, like \\"Dancing with andromeda\\" and \\" sitting on the moon\\". Also the intro are rich in chords. <br />I recomend to Enigma lovers this album, just buy it with the eyes closed, and listen with the mind opened.
032147404X|5.0|This is a great book for the average photo enthusiast.  The goal of the book is to teach an average photographer to take great photos.  Its relatively short and each point only takes a page to explain.  Also the explanations are short and to the point.  Kelby doesn't prattle on about optic theory or other mundane issues, instead he tells you that pros generally do this or that.  As Kelby says in his intro, he giving you tips as if you were a buddy out shooting photos with him.  Kinda like a photography mentor that is giving you pointers to improve you photos.   <br /> <br />The book is arranged by the type of photography being pursued.  Flowers, Weddings, Landscapes, People, Sports, and Travel.  Kelby is considered a Photoshop authority, so he covers some of that and and also what to focus on to prevent problems in photos that can't be fixed with Photoshop.  He also does something that few authors are willing to do; he makes suggestions about equipment and vendors.  While this type of information gets dated quickly in a book, its interesting to hear what he thinks is a good product. <br /> <br />His writing style is casual and humorous, which I appreciate.  The topic can be rather dry, but Kelby's style of writing and the quick pace of the book kept me awake and engaged.  I have read many books on digital photography and most assume that you recently had your brain erased and therefore you know nothing about photography.  Consequently, those books start at the most basic of information and don't seem to teach you how to get great shots.  They also put me to sleep.  This is the only book I have seen that is different. <br /> <br />Is some of the advice oversimplifying it to a degree?  Sure it is.  Not everything can be improved using the photo recipes that Kelby gives you, but for the average photographer, the general rules will help produce better photos and thats what its all about.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I bought this albumn for only the remake of John Lennons \\"war is over\\" but I loovvvve this albumn. It relaxes not only me but my 6 year old daughter who loves \\"silent night\\". I would reccommend this albumn, it is one of those that you just sit back with a glass of wine and watch it snow or a fire cracking if you have neither its a good albumn to just chill after a long day. I will continue to listen to this even after the holidays are over. <br />
B000JK8OYU|3.0|Laugh all you want, but I find Herb Alpert's \\"Rewhipped\\" a lot more fun for the money.  It was done in a similar remix vain, except that it had the advantage of peer review.<br /><br />I've never been \\"of the Beatles faith\\" particularly, but Love's \\"Within You Without You\\" was worth five bucks of the cover price alone.  Above all else, the clarity knocks me out.  The audio is not the work of ProTools, but clearly that of a technical futurist and audio cowboy.  My God does it sound clean!<br /><br />Even so, I found the funky reworks of \\"Lemon Tree\\", \\"Whipped Cream\\" and \\"A Taste of Honey\\" on Herb Alpert's reissue a better bargain.  I can almost hear the Sir Beatles Fans rolling their eyes right now.  Puhhhleesse grow up.<br /><br />There's no need to get into a no-win war over whether the artists (that term DOES include the producer) should be canonized or crucified.  Music--like language--was meant for the generation that made it.  Groovy if it goes any further than that.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Well, at first I thought this was blasphemy. After all, I've been a Beatlemaniac since 1964. I heard the 4 tracks that were previewed on The Beatles web site and wasn't too sure at first but then they started to grow on me. I eagerly awaited the release of \\"Love\\" and got it the week it came out. It seemed strange at first to hear these classic songs tampered with but, bearing in mind that they ARE a \\"soundscape\\" for the Cirque Vegas show and ARE endorsed by the surviving Beatles, it didn't take long for me to really get into it. Now, I'm rabid about turning others on to it and am excited about possible future projects involving the reworking of The Fab's catalog of great songs. At the least, the sterling sound on this CD points to a complete remastering of the entire Beatles catalog...and soon! One can only hope that a DVD with the visuals of the Cirque show will be forthcoming. Don't listen to the \\"naysayers\\", if you're a fan you'll enjoy this CD.

0143036556|5.0|After Diamond won his MacArthur (the \\"genius grant\\") - a tribute to his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book, \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" - he embarked on a new project, and one that is just as ambitious: why societies fail.  Taking advantage of his wide experience and far-flung travel, he has marshaled together case studies of many different peoples, in many different places: Viking settlements in North America and Greenland, the Mayan civilization in South America, and various islands, such as Easter Island, in the South Pacific.  He also compares them in a coherent manner to societies which managed to back away from the brink, such as Tikopia and Iceland.<br /><br />Some readers have objected to Diamond not giving us all the information with respect to some of these civilizations; I can only say that my general ignorance of the subject allowed me to absorb without irritation.  The book is a good read, bringing together history, mining, agriculture, sea-faring and societal structures and strictures in many centuries. Because of its focus on places flung far apart both in space and time, it offers most readers a look at civilizations with which they might not be so familiar. I was particularly enchanted by the story of Tikopia, an island of less than two square miles, and impressed at how the villagers decided to kill all the pigs, and thus eliminate a food source that took too many resources to produce.  (Could this be the hidden explanation for why the ancient Israelites removed pork from their menus?  Not because the meat was unclean, but because pigs required too much fuel in a society that had to be lean and mean and support a growing population?)<br /><br />The entertainment and educational value of \\"Collapse\\" is clear and worthy. Diamond offers suggestions for people at the end of the book; things we can do. (I am very relieved that he does this, for reading about so many failed civilizations is a downer, and I am wondering if I should dig up my yard and plant it full of trees, as deforestation seems to be the worst and most visible issue.)  The book would be worth getting just for this, and especially on the strategies he discusses on bringing business and environmentalists together. Laws need to be passed which enable businesses to be green and still compete, and environmentalists need to be less shrill and anti-business - when a business does a good thing, it should get a pat on the back instead of constantly being told it's the \\"enemy.\\"<br /><br />There are a few solutions and issues that Diamond does not touch on, perhaps because they're too controversial - for example, I would have liked to have read his thoughts on nuclear power.  But overall, Diamond has written another important book - and on a subject which is even more important to our future than \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" More people should read this book.  And more of us should ask ourselves what we can do in 2007 to help civilization edge back from the brink.

0385473788|4.0|Imagine living for two years inside cramped living quarters, with eight other people, not being able to go outside. It is impossible to find any space where you can be by yourself and have some down time. This is what happens to Anne Frank in The Diary of a Young Girl. Anne Frank lives with her family, The Franks; a family friend, Mr. Dussel; and an entire other family, the van Dans; inside a Secret Annex in the back of a warehouse. The eight are all Jews hiding from the Nazis in World War II. This first hand account of a young Jewish girl in hiding is very detailed, eye opening experience. I recommend The Diary of a Young Girl to those interested in learning more about what the Jews went through during World War II.<br /><br />Anne Frank uses vivid, crystal-clear, descriptions in her diary. In particular, Anne has colorful descriptions of the circumstances about their confinement in hiding. Here is one description showing the social aspect of being in hiding for so long with the same people: \\"Relationships are getting worse here in the Annex all the time. We don't dare to open our mouths at mealtime (except to slip a bite of food), because no matter what we say, someone is bound to resent it or take it the wrong way.\\" Quotes like these make the reader feel as though they are watching the story and can visualize it. Her detail is persistent throughout the story and helps to give perspective to any reader.<br /><br />The Diary of a Young Girl conveys a Jewish girl's personal experience. Anne Frank gives the reader a first hand experience of the fears of Jews in World War II, who often had to hide in order to survive. Anne talks about her worry of being discovered in their hiding place, and of the Nazis attacking them. \\"Tonight the guns have been banging away so much that I've already had to gather up my belongings four times. Today I packed a suitcase with the stuff I'd need in case we had to flee, but as mother correctly noted, `Where would you go?'\\" Without reading this book I would have never truly comprehended the anxiety and suffering Jews went through in Holland, and many other parts of Europe.<br /><br />Anne Frank is a fascinating and detailed historical account. Although the story is slow in some parts, I do recommend the book The Diary of a Young Girl, especially to teenage girls in today's world. A personal, non-fiction diary, is much more powerful than any history textbook. Anne Frank was a young girl full of hope and promise in every day of her life, not knowing exactly what the future would bring. The Diary of a Young Girl is a powerful story that brings the reader back to the Jews' terrible experiences in World War II and gives our generation insight into this important historical period.this book I would have never truly comprehended the anxiety and suffering Jews went through in Holland, and many other parts of Europe.<br /><br />Anne Frank is a fascinating and detailed historical account.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Instead of tap dancing and singing penguins, we get Al Gore.  Yeppers, Al Gore is not nearly as cute and cuddly as Mumbo the penguin.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, what Mr. Gore gives us is a view as to what's going on with the world, and what we are doing to make the situation worse, or in some cases, better.  I know it's tough to watch and listen too without being drawn into his point-of-view.  He seems to have backed up his view with strong evidence, and we should take care to pay attention. <br /> <br />Is he wrong?  If his survey of the scientific literature is correct, then the scientists seem to say no.  We can always hope that he's not.  We can always hope that the continual stories of how our climates seem to be changing are wrong.  In fact, I hope he is, because if he's not we're in for a beating from the weather. <br /> <br />For those of you who are opposed to what Mr. Gore points toward, it is up to you to convince us, with the science to back it up, of your point-of-view.  Good luck with that. <br /> <br />For everybody else, I highly reccomend that you buy, borrow or rent this DVD. <br /> <br />Highest rating for a documentary from me.

B0006399FS|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD I was kind of disappointed being a hardcore U2 fan. But the more I listened to this CD, the more it grew on me. Until I was totally in love with it. Some CDs blow you out of the water the first time you hear them, others grow on you. This album is really a great album if you take the time to really listen to it.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|\\"Love, Angel, Music, Baby\\" was one of my favorite pop albums of the last few years. It was fun, energetic, smart, full of diverse influences, and sexy to boot. Gwen came out swinging with her first solo effort and set the bar very high for herself. Perhaps a little too high. That being said, \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is a satifying album. There are several fun songs, but there are also a lot of songs that are just filler, and that is using the word nicely. The opening track, and first single, \\"Wind It Up\\", though catchy, wears very thin, very fast and was a surprising choice as a lead single. Maybe it was chosen because it was a combination of two hits from her first album (the broadway of \\"Rich Girl\\" and the beats of \\"Hollaback Girl\\") \\"The Sweet Escape\\" has an actual melody, but is somewhat generic and Madonna-80s-lite. \\"Orange County Girl\\" seems to be a track that people are talking about, but I find it repetitive and unextraordinary. Now, with \\"Early Winter\\" we finally get to a track that I can get on board with. It has a great melody and allows Gwen to use her voice on an emotional track with substance. It has a dark edge and would make a great single to establish her as a \\"singer\\" again. \\"Now That YOu Got It\\" is a fun, funky dance track that finds her having fun and being sassy and sexy. \\"4 in the Morning\\" is a lot like \\"The Real Thing\\" from L.A.M.B., but different enough to be a good listen and easily one of the best tracks on the album. \\"Yummy\\" is a great track and has a great beat, albeit it's a little \\"Fergalicious\\" if you ask me. \\"Fluorescent\\" sounds the most like an 80s track to me, which is good in my opinion, and is pretty easy on the ears and the feet too! \\"Breakin' Up\\" is a pretty dark, ominous sounding song with good lyrics and a real girl-power anthem for this album. \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" is another song that sounds A LOT like \\"Hollaback Girl\\", but is fun nonetheless, and has a fun circus theme chorus line. \\"U Started It\\", is very Prince influenced in it's sound and has a fresh summery sound that I like. \\"Wonderful Life\\" has a New Order/Depeche Mode/new wave sound to it and would also make a great single to switch her gears a bit. \\"Candyland\\" has a great groove and trumpet sound that makes it a very different and stand out song on the record. Over all \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is a good album, but not as good as L.A.M.B.
B000301YY8|5.0|I really love this new artist. It's so refreshing to hear an original artist among all the overproduced and overhyped celebrity singers. The songs are mellow and deep and James' voice is wonderful. I consider myself a really tough critic when it comes to music (among other things hehe) but this CD is one of my favorite recent additions to my collection.
0156027321|4.0|I would never have guessed that I would read a book about a boy on a boat with a tiger at this point in my life (after fifth grade) but I'm glad I did. Life of Pi is obviously about more than that.  For me it was about faith.  But more it was a great story.  I enjoyed reading about the zoo stuff, and the religous stuff, and how he got named after a swiming pool, etc. This is no touchy feely outing either. It is at times harrowing and gory. A big criterea for me is how much I think about a book later.  Pi crosses my mind all the time.  This would be a great book for a discussion group. I'm not really sure I got it right but I choose to believe.
B0002BK9IU|5.0|this album is a definite far cry from anything they have done before.  it will be a bit hard for the strictly bubblegum fans to accept as a good album. i would say that it has more in common with a Motorhead album than say, Pleasant Dreams or Rocket to Russia. i will ssay that this album sounds like a harder hitting Road to Ruin..or Road to Ruin on heroin. it really is a great album if your in the mood for some hard hitting punk in the vein of an Oi band or something(i guess that is why Captain Oi re-issued it.) Joey does do some interesting things with his voice here.    anyways, i have seen some pretty poor reviews of this album and i think it is absurd. while it is fascinating to know that this same band created the almost too poppy \\"end of the century,\\" it is also great to see how they do not regress for fans. i mean this is a fascinating era for the Ramones. they all were bitter with each other, marky was back in, dee dee was on his way out. it basically is a glance at a band going through tremendous changes. to the elitists... i mean how many times would you want them to churn out rocket to russia or leave home? a band changes and experiments. as long as they dont succumb to anyone else, they are bound to keep things going greatly.    i recommend this version to collectors. fits in nicely with the first 8 remastered albums and has a nice story, remastered sound, and a bonus of the wonderful pet cemetary.
020161622X|3.0|The authors of the book have a \\"light\\" writing style that makes this an easy book to read. The book is full of wisdom and insight with nothing too groundbreaking inside. The book provides plenty of solid theory that can be applied at the reader's discretion as applications and programming environments allow. As you might have surmised, the author's suggest you be practical in your approach to development. If I had to find something wrong with the book it would be that the authors get so pragmatic that their ideas almost become impractical. When I read a book like this I am always thinking, \\"Could I convince my development team of these ideas?\\" If I think I can't because the benefits are not an easy sell then I consider the idea impractical.  <br /> <br />The book is a little better than average but 3 ½ stars was not an option. Reading the book was like going to see an OK movie. You don't think it was a waste of money, but you probably won't rent it again. <br />
0679746323|1.0|The authors are in the business of writing best-selling books, not history, or any real form of scholarship. The ways they selectively presented and intentionally misintepreted evidence are oftentimes childish. Their theory in historical explanation is simple: 1/ Mao was responsible for every bad thing happend to the Chinese people (and many others) during the time he lived on this planet, and 2/ all other people were just dummies being manipulated by Mao in any way he wanted (and this includes not only the Chinese people, who struggled, suffered, and sacrificed for their ideals, but also foreign leaders of all ideological persuations).  <br /> <br />The Yale historian Jonathan Spence gave a polite but damaging review of this book in last year's New York Review of Books. Anyone who can find that review should read it before spending time on this book.
0201633612|4.0|This book does a great job of explaining patterns and pointing out benefits and drawbacks to each one. As an aspiring OO developer of business applications though, this books does not provide much guidance. The examples are given for real-time applications like user interfaces for a drawing application, etc. Applying these patterns to a distributed application with a database backend that records everything is a tough leap to make. I give it a high rating because it does its job well, however, I wish it would have addressed a broader scope of application types.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse continues to redefine themselves with each album they produce.  This one adds a touch of U2, a pinch of Radiohead, and a dab of Queen to produce a truly unique sound.  MUST OWN!
0201485672|4.0|In my humble opinion, of course, every developer should understand the concept of refactoring. And because I don't know of a better book for explaining the process and benefits of refactoring, I think every developer should read this book. As always, I did not agree with every bit of commentary, but there's nothing in there that would keep me from recommending this book.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris, in taking a bold and unflinching look at religious faith, expresses sentiments that many thinking people share but haven't voiced so publicly. The End of Faith is utterly rational as it looks at the flawed thinking in both by-the-book and more moderate forms of religious faith. His recounting of specific texts in the Koran that advocate the death of infidels is chilling, and his reminders of historical horrors perpetuated by each of the \\"great religions\\" should give anyone pause in the face of today's world crisis. One of Harris' most important points is that religious fervor (especially coupled with the concept of a holy war against non-believers) mixes very badly with weapons of mass destruction. Each of us ought to take a deep and honest look at ourselves and our beliefs. I recommend this book to anyone willing to give it a try.
B000ICLHIE|4.0|I'm a massive Tom Waits fan.  I consider Heart of Saturday Night, Small Change, Swordfishtrombones, Raindogs, One From the Heart and the collection Beautiful Maladies to be darn near masterpieces, the first two for certain are.  I never cared for Mule Variations.  Couldn't stand Black Rider though I saw the opera in L.A. and was transfixed, not so much by the play which was ok but his music done by a 10 or so person 'Waitsian' orchestra was breathtaking.  Real Gone is the first cd he's released since the 80's that finally got my pleasure sensors back again to his tunes.  In the meantime, I've heard the unofficial Tales Fromthe Underground 5 cd set and find it to be interesting.  I can cull out a cd worth of songs that I'd listen to regularly.  It's mainly stuff from the 90's and 2000's.  Still, most of it is just not stuff that's magical like his 70's and 80's songs.  I find a distinct difference.  The earlier songs are nearly all instant classics aside from his solid but sorta too early in his career Closing Time first lp.  The 90's and 2000's work I rarely find an instant classic.  I find a high quality, adventerous musician who travels musical paths that nary another person does (with his musical co-conspirator his cool wife).  But it's mostly just interesting to me, nothing I play more than once.<br /><br />  I love his live shows.  I saw him in 78 and in 81.  Spectacular, particularly the 78 show in San Diego.  I've heard 50 shows recorded by others over the years, strictly in trade.  There is a ton of marvelous material there.  In fact, this 3xCD set makes me hope that one day he'll cull out the finest recorded live songs he has like the one about a whole bunch of famous people being invited over to a bar, he does that one live with way more embellishments and humor than on his record and one song where he goes on a long time talking about all the cars he's owned and none of them worked and he makes a completely accurate sound a number of times of a car that just won't kick over as well as just perfect sounds of cars whizzing by.  That and he does a very brave and musically sucessful cover of James Brown's Papa's Got A Brand New Bag.  A full CD release of some of those best of songs he's done live would make for an extremely satisfying release.  In fact, he's gotten more and more funny as the years have progressed with little stories and humerous lead ins to songs that would be a real service to his fans to have in one CD.<br /><br />  I first sampled this 3xCD today around noon.  I was starting to think, except for a handful of songs that maybe that guy who did a review who wanted a refund was right.  I thought if I heard it again and gave it another chance maybe that wouldn't be the case.  Well, I sampled the set again this evening.  When it was nighttime.  Man, what a difference that made.  I've always felt that his music is best enjoyed at night.  Particularly driving, for me, up to L.A. from San Diego or even all the way to S.F.  Sure, it could be that on second listening I got more of the groove.  We'll see.  My guess is that just it being night made all the differnce.  Sorta like baked salmon or broccoli just don't taste the same for breakfast and Cheerios just isn't the same for dinner.  It's just not.<br /><br />  That package is spectacular.  It's possibly the finest I've ever seen, by any artist.  I wish I had the technological ability to enlarge the photos of him from the book to make a coffee table sized book out of them.  That'd be really nice.  Very artistic.  I wish there was more specific info about when and where the various songs were recorded, a minor complaint.  The package as a whole is simply worth buying the darned thing and not burning a friend's copy.  In fact, burning CD's are so easy and commonplace, just as taping records were back in the olden days, that it's just this kinda startlingly delightful package that can urge the consumer to break down and buy the thing.<br /><br />  I'm a big fanof HALF JAPANESE.  I dunno if they wrote that song about King Kong but I like Tom's use of 3 variations of his vocals weaving the song together.  I miss the ending that Jad Fair does on it, pronouncing King Kong, for the first time, strongly at the very end of the song, which is missing on this version.  Still, great to hear.  I love the sorta Twilight Zone music and matter of fact descriptions of gross things insects do.  There's probably 4 or 5 songs on each CD that, together, would make one fine CD for my ears.  The good thing about this set is that each fan can make their own culled version.  Heck, I'll bet, particularly reading some of these reviews, that lots of folks will be happy to hear 'em as is.<br /><br />  I'd love to give this 5 stars.  For his staking out a musical claim that doesn't exist elsewhere, God bless 'im for making music that you just can't find anywhere else, music you can delve into to more deeply explore cuz it's often complex, multi layered and, often really rock based.  I would give it that 5 star rating.  The set doesn't feel like a bunch of cast offs.  It doesn't feel like a bunch of rejects that were inferior.  It's one of the finest anthology sets (see X, SUPERCHUNK, JOHNNY CASH and I'm sure others) of mainly unreleased versions that's been made.  And I greatly admire the sets by those 3 bands.<br /><br />  Gimme that best of live CD.  Meanwhile, I won't kick this thing outta bed and I look forward to leisurely exploring it more fully, not just sampling it but running deep into each song and see where it takes me.  Can't wait to do that, even if it's not my ultimate favorite Waits stuff.  It's still a great gift from, along with Neil Young, America's most consistently productive and creative musician.SE.

B0001LYH9S|5.0|I've always been intrigued by David Bowie's music without ever investigating his back-catalogue. The greatest hits packages were where I thought Bowie ruled.  <br /> <br />Recently, however, I've started buying his albums and I can't believe the quality of Bowie's music. The reason I feel compelled to write about 'Outside' is that this was the first album I can remember being released with any significance since the mid-80's. I remember not being very impressed with the singles \\"Heart's Filthy Lesson\\" (not included on the 'Se7en' soundtrack) and \\"Hallo Spaceboy\\", so I dismissed this CD. <br /> <br />How wrong I was! 'Outside' is one of Bowie's best albums. <br /> <br />'Outside' is a concept album based on an investigation by Bowie's alter-ego PI Nathan Adler and is one of the most tremendous and audacious undertakings in rock history. It combines different styles of music including predominantly the 'industrial' sound which was made popular at the time by NIN (I recall Bowie even toured the US with Trent Reznor). The tracks flow together brilliantly with various segues performed by Bowie, resulting in much more than just a collection of songs. The stand-out tracks include mellow and melodic \\"I'm Deranged\\" (the opening track to David Lynch's film 'The Lost Highway') and the catchy \\"I Have Not Been to Oxford Town\\" (heard in the film 'Starship Troopers') - demonstrating how impressionable this album was and still is. I wouldn't be suprised to find alot of people having heard these songs and not attributing them to this album or perhaps even to David Bowie. Other stand-out tracks include the most typical Bowie tune \\"Strangers When We Meet\\" and the dark and smooth \\"No Control\\". <br /> <br />But, if you do treat this album as only a series of songs, then you will miss out, as there have not been many concept albums of this quality. Use the production skills of Brian Eno (yes! Eno is back on deck) and the song writing flexibility of David Bowie to enjoy one of rock's bestcollaborations. You will not be disappointed if you are a true lover of Bowie's music or one who enjoys quality work.
B000FBGBPC|1.0|I hate bands that have a kickass debut cd and then suck after that. This CD sounded nothing like their first one. If you want a consistant band that puts out great album(s), go with Tool.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|The only disappointing track on this CD is 'O Little Town of Bethlehem', which is NOT the same as the sample track you will hear on the Amazon website when you click below the large picture of McClachlan.  The track on the website is beautiful and watching McClachlan's expressive singing makes it even more enjoyable.  The solo guitar accompaniment is full bodied and greatly complements the song.  On the CD, however, it sounds as though McClachlan is playing an old 1950's Stella guitar with steel strings, but it is probably a dobro which explains the very tinny, unnatural sound on this track.  It really cheapens the song and her voice.  The addition of the violins only creates more of a puzzle for me of why one would juxtapose a strummed dobro with a string ensemble.  Maybe it was meant to create an aura of simplicity and humility, but that was done much more effectively on the sample track on the website.  I simply can't imagine what the producers and recording engineers were thinking when they mixed this track the way they did. <br /> <br />Notwithstanding the above, this CD is one of the best I've purchased in quite a while.  From Happy Xmas to Christmas Time is Here, I have derived hours of pleasure out of listening to McClachlan and the accompaniments to her unique, beautiful voice.  The muted trumpet and synthesizer on 'I'll be Home for Christmas' adds a nice, ehtereal quality to the accompaniment.  Her unique rendition of 'What Child is This' is haunting and draws you into the song in a melancholy sort of way.  And to top this whole CD off, having Diana Krall, one of my favorite artists, at the piano on 'Christmas Time is Here' was an unexpected pleasure.  All in all, a great buy, a great performer, a great CD to add to your holiday collection.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|\\"Thank you for smoking\\", directed by Jason Reitman, is a wonderful satirical comedy that is likely to offend some people, but that is nonetheless witty and entertaining. If you merely want to watch a feel-good film, I strongly urge you to avoid this dvd. On the other hand, if you are eager to think a little bit more, and don't mind a sometimes acerbic sense of humour, this is the right movie for you.<br /><br />The main character is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist and spokesman for the American tobacco industry that is a master of media spinning and doublespeak, and that is glad of having \\"a moral flexibility that goes beyond most people\\". Nick has a son, Joey, and thus has to try to be a role model to him, despite his polemic job. That is specially difficult after a beautiful reporter (Katie Holmes) with whom he had an affair betrays his trust, writing a tell-all article about him.<br /><br />It is pretty interesting to watch Nick as he twists logic in order to defend the right of everybody to smoke, saying that has to do with freedom of choice. In his words, \\"that's the beauty of arguing, because if you argue correctly you are never wrong\\". This film has fictional characters, but is also based on some real facts, something that makes it specially interesting. From my point of view, \\"Thank you for smoking\\" is a caustic and ironic film, but also a must see for everybody that is interested in the power of words. Recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B00005JNQS|5.0|Robots (Widescreen Edition)~ Robin Williams is a really well made animated movie. The animation is top of the line, and the script is very well written. The dialog is great and Robin Williams does a bang up job in his role. The music is right on the mark and there are so many memorable scenes in this movie. Like the scene with \\"hair\\", the dancing scene and the ride into capital city to mention a few. The jokes are a bit advanced and I could imagine that kids would have a hard time understanding them all. The story is about a young  poor robot called Copperbottom who has a dream to become an inventor and tries his luck in capital city. However, the company has changed leadership and motto and has been taken over by a greedy boss that no longer creates spare parts and this leads to disaster for all the robots that can not afford new upgrades. The message is that exploitation of people is wrong and teaches tolerance which is a good message to teach kids of all ages. I highly recommend this movie and I definitely give it 5 out of 5 stars.
B0006399FS|2.0|U2 hasn't ROCKED since POP. This effort is overproduced, and under-written. Bono's lyrics are getting worse as he continues to spend more time away from the band. The rhythm section here is pedestrian at best, and Edge is just recycling like never before. <br /> <br />I'm a HUGE fan, dating back to when I first saw them in January 1981, but this is weak. POP had it all, great drums and bass, lyrics and Edge experimenting and creating rather than recycling. It's a true work of art right up there Joshua Tree and Actung Baby. This is just sub-par. <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Stadium Arcadium~ Red Hot Chili Peppers is an absolutely stunning album from RHCP. Anthony Kiedis is a very good lyricist and a vocalist that is much better than what one would expect. Having been a fan of this band since I saw them on MTV back in the day (1991) I consider this to be on par with their previous great releases such as Californication. The book-let is a great peice of art and the photos are right on the mark. I love the idea that they named each of the albums after planets, i.e., Jupiter and Mars. I will definitely recommend this album and I give it 5 well deserved stars. Way to go and considering that they have another 10 songs already recorded then I can not wait for their next release!
B000J103YI|1.0|I just got the 2-disc Special Edition,Original Broadway Cast,Remastered & Brilliant!!!I was there for the Broadway Production & i don't think any sountrack can compare to the original,especially this new Re-Mastered Edition.As you can see Amazon has already sold out the Broadway CD S.E.Call me jaded,but i would wait till the movie comes out to see if Beyonce's DreamGirls even compares.That is for you folks that have seen the Original Broadway Production.Jennifer Holiday,Sheryl Lee Ralf & Loretta Devine & the rest of the Original Broadway Cast,The Very Best!!!!!
B00000JZI9|5.0|First of all,let me say I enjoyed it immensely and that it has all the elements we look for in an \\"epic\\" western.Terrific storyline,characters,action,scenery,music,sets,and minimal amount of suspense and mystery.There is a great difference between a Western and a Mystery novel;and I prefer that they are not combined.In other words ,my type of Western deals with 'how is this situation going to get resolved',not,' who dunnit'.<br />  Silverado is great entertainment; where all one has to do is sit back,enjoy the story,action,characters,music,history,landscape,and let oneself become part of the Old West,albeit for only a couple of hours.<br />  I would ,however ,like to comment on the trailer by Lawrence Kasden,who discusses \\"Making of the Movie\\".He tells why he made it,why he made it the way he did and a lot of what went into it with respect to scenery,building the set (town),winter weather conditions,coaching for the gun battles,etc. My only regret it that I would have liked more of what he did.Anyway, what he did was interesting and appreciated.
B000002NIW|5.0|I first got into Deftones during my senior year in high school when I went out and bought \\"Around the Fur\\" (the band's second album), and quickly became one of my all time favorite albums, and it's also my favorite Deftones album overall. The first song \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" was the first song I heard from these guys prior to buying this album. Chino Moreno's vocals that can range from soft whispers, to melodic singing, to mad crazy screams. Stephen Carpenter has great guitar riffs that pack an intense punch and are downright catchy. Chi Cheng's  bass lines are pretty cool and very ominous. Abe Cunningham's drumming may not be fast, but it's very hard hitting, and keeps my pulse pounding throughout. The first song \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" is an instant classic and it's my favorite song on this album. The driving guitar riffs and the chorus is just catchy as hell. I definately agree with A.Stutheit that this song would make a great soundtrack for the last day of school (thank God I'm not in school anymore, hahahahaha). Another one of my favorite songs \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" is another instant classic and it's very melodic with some more catchy riffs, and some nice singing from Chino. Other standouts include the title track, \\"Ihabia\\", \\"Rickets\\" \\"Lotion\\", \\"Dai the Flu\\", and \\"Headup\\" (featuring guest vocals from Max Cavalera). Hey every song is a winner in my book. If you're a fan of Deftones, metal, hard rock, or if you're just a dude with an open mind like me, \\"Around the Fur is a must have. Peace Out!!<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br /><br />1. My Own Summer (Shove It) - 10/5 My favorite song<br /><br />2. Ihabia - 5/5<br /><br />3. Mascara - 5/5<br /><br />4. Around the Fur - 5/5<br /><br />5. Rickets - 5/5<br /><br />6. Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) - 5/5<br /><br />7. Lotion - 5/5<br /><br />8. Dai the Flu - 5/5<br /><br />9. Headup - 5/5<br /><br />10. MX - 5/5<br /><br />P.S. Forget Limp Bizkit. Chino pawns Fred Durst anytime.
0061191752|5.0|This is quite a pageturner. My wife and I rarely finish the same book within the same day. We live an era of ghost written celebrity biographies written with boring pedantic voices. I have no illusions that Ramsay wrote this book without assistance (whether an editor or overzealous assistant)but the book certainly captures his voice. The result is an honest unapologetic narrative of the life of a remarkable man. There are lessons to be learned, hard work as the solution for overcoming adversity. Readers of food porn may be dissapointed in that the book is less about the food than the man behind the food. Fans of Ramsay will be delighted because of the insight into the method behind his madness.
B000J4QWNQ|3.0|I loved the 80's TV show so I was eager to see this.  But boy is it different from the show.  Don't expect to see Crockett's sailboat, his Scarab, his Spyder, or even Elvis.  Don't expect to see the other vice cops either.  The plot is tough to follow with a lot of fast dialogue with tons of jargon.  But its a seemingly well made film that has me interested enough to watch it again so that I can hopefully understand the plot.  The HD DVD picture quality was mixed.  Some shots, whether night or day, looked very clear and sharp, while other shots (mostly in cars, boats, or planes) were much noiser.  I have to wonder if they used 2 different cameras or if this was done for style.  This is a pricy combo so it may be wise to just rent it if you're not sure you'll like it.
B000J103N4|5.0|This is the second album to have been remastered and re-released which not only is of the age of aquarius but typifies the best of the spirit of that age. Taken together with Paul Kantner's masterful Blows Against the Empire, this album transcends much of the music which has been made since.<br /><br />I may be biased but the care which has gone into making this possible is there for all to hear. Both in the CD as well as the DVD is love and devotion to the sound and general ambience. I am sure that Crosby's colleague Neil Young would be proud of the quality, timbre and life that comes from these discs.<br /><br />Space, the final frontier...I remember the first CD I ever heard, Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms, and I was in sheer awe of the degree of separation and the quality of the music which shone through. After hearing both of these discs I am once more overawed, not just with the sound, the singing, the playing...OMG Jerry Garcia on the pedal steel, an instrument he had just taken up and did not know how to play and yet some of the most cosmic sounds you have ever heard man, come through from his heart. Sheer Bliss.<br /><br />However I digress. There is not one song on this beautiful album that would get less than five stars. Every breath that comes from David Crosby shimmers and stirs the soul. His singing contribution as well as his writing collaborations are inspiring, almost spiritual in a hippie sort of way and I am positive that this album was the backdrop of much chemical imbibing when it first came out but it is almost like a form of chanting and reaching out into the listeners souls.  Oh, what are their names, the men who really run this land, could be part of an Airplane bombing run on Washington but sung by Crosby with the biggest supergroup on earth at the time, they are transformed into a campaign anthem for direct action.  Laughing had me in tears at the sound of Jerry's spacey pedal steel which will never grace the sweet earth again and Crosby's lyrics, laid back and giving new meaning to the innocence of childhood.<br /><br />The album starts off with Music is Love which becomes a completely improvisational pice with intertwining voices blending together and flowing apart almost in a scat like way but with so much harmony.<br /><br />My other favourite song is the translucent like production of Song Without Words (Tree With No Leaves), just voices and instruments. Masterful licks from Jerry who is not the only awesome guitarist on this album, and those harmonies...like being in a church with choir and all the while in such harmony with the electric instruments.<br /><br />The first time I went to San Francisco, I went to get the spiritual calling of the Grateful Dead from my system which I did, discovering my spiritual home at the same time, but I was also able to visit some of the places which played a part in the making of this marvel. Mount Tamalpais, Sausalito were two of the places I was fortunate to see and the evidence of the parts they played in Crosby's compositions are clearly evident. Throughout the quality of the musicianship is without doubt and there are no redundant or surplus players anywhere to be found. Only in the Bay Area could so many top notch musicians come together without disharmony and personalities clashing.<br /><br />I'd Swear That There Was Somebody Here is a revelation under remastering. Clearly somewhat of an improvisational piece which developed. I am reminded in parts of the soundtrack to Zabriskie Point which Garcia had participated in, as well as some of the musical idioms Garcia would return to later in the seventies as he foreswore his journey into the nether regions of psychedalia and turned back into the roots of American music. It is a suite in effect of musics that bring out the blue sky searching of Crosby and his willingness to experiment, searching for the sound, following his muse.<br /><br />Sadly, for us, there is only one bonus track, Kids and Dogs, which may be a throwaway title but it is not a throaway piece of music. It begins as if the musicians are hanging out on a porch and just playing for each other until the Crosby vocals insert themselves in the same inimatable style which characterises the whole album and the voices and players become as one heading into a different, heavenly dimension. Garcia provides the perfect foil to Crosby's vocals (it had been he after all who had shunted them in the direction of The Workingman's Dead and the sublime American Beauty)but there is no pressure, it is not competitive, it is just heading out there, boldly going where no-one had gone before and few have ventured since especially in our post-modern drab north american \\"musical\\" world. And then we are back on the porch on a sunny San Francisco day or maybe in the Japanese tea garden, just as they say in the venacular, chillin'.<br /><br />I wanted to give kantner's album six and I wish I could give this six too. This has to be one of the albums of the century and every home should have one.<br /><br />Shameless plug time. If you are forty five years old or older, you should definitely conside giving this as a great holiday gift.<br /><br />Marvellous, bloody marvellous!and Dogs, which may be a throwaway title but it is not a throaway piece of music.

B000084T18|3.0|hello there you great people of the hip-hop community im back to do another review for all you 50cent first time buyers and 50cent fans who for some wierd reason haven't bought the album yet.<br /><br />i must say that im not a massive 50cent fan and im more on the old classics but i felt like i needed to do i review on 50cent. i do have 2 50cent albums in my collection but i wouldn't say there on the top self (that space is saved for pac, tweedy bird loc, bloods and crips and C.M.W) but i do have 50cent in there.<br /><br />now this was the first 50cent album i bought and i will admit it took some growing on me, for you hip-hop fans of the classic older hip-hop might feel the same when listening to the cd, some of 50cents lyrics can seem a little corney but this album does seem like his best so far. most people know about 50cents back ground from the film he realsed about his life so we know the guys not had it easy and a lot of what he rap's about did probably happen to guy (there's nothing worse then an artist lying about what a harsh life he's had growing up in the getto if his mum and dad bought him a brand new bmw for every birthday)<br /><br />i think 50cent has done well on this album, dre had a lot of influance on the album but you cant realy tell as 50cent seems to have put in his own style which i thinks great. the albums done extremely well due to it been rather radio friendly so if you are a hard core classics hip-hop fan like myself, give the album a miss unless you pick it up for dirt cheap.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|Remastering and reissuing back catalog in a box set is all the rage now.  Queen, Talking Heads, the Beatles, etc.  The Queen box sounds pretty good.  Talking Heads even better in 5.1 dual disc format.  DD will not play reliably in some machines.  The stereo redbook sides of some of my TH box skip or will not play but the 5.1 DVD/DVDA sides play fine in my Marantz universal disc players.  The Doors Music Company went all out.  They did both.  You get cd's and dvd/dvda's of each of the 6 studio albums, remasterd stereo cd's and remastered 2ch, 5.1 and 5.1DTS on the DVD's.  Listen to the first disc without reading any of the enclosed booklet.  Does it sound a little different, funny, better, worse?  I won't give it away.  You have to listen and then read.  I found the vocal 's buried in the mix on the first disc using the dvd dts layer.  I punched up the center channel 2 to 4 db and got the vocals even with the front channels.  Not much going on in the rears on the first disc for some reason but by the time you get to the 3rd and 4th discs, there is plenty going on in the rear speakers.   <br /> <br />Overall the sound, excepting the first disc for some reason and really only on Break on Thru, the first track, is exceptional.  The SS mixes are very nicely done again except for the first disc for some reason.  I love the remastered box sets.  I am a lazy music collector/lover at heart and the record companies are making it so easy for me to buy their back catalog all over again and again, about every ten years and it just keeps getting better.  5 stars overall, 4 for the content (some of this stuff to me is just drivel while the rest is pure genius, the outakes and videos really do nothing for me but some folks will go ga ga over it and buy just for that, cool but there is a reason these things were outakes), 5 stars for sonics.  Well done Bruce and Paul.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Not a big John Mayer fan, I got the his previous album, which was ok, loved his first... and this is right up there. The music is soulful, meaningful lyrics and has some of the most rythmic beats I've heard for a long time... almost gives me goosebumps listening to Belief and Heart of life... I can't stop listening to it!!! Even if you've never heard John Mayer before, this cd is refreshing...and just plain good music! His talents are undeniable...his voice, simple and true, and his lyrics touch the heart!
B0000C6K09|5.0|This four CD set expands on the previously released John Williams Greatest Hits.  It's a grand collection of nearly four hours of famous music scores from over forty years.  There are many songs never before available in any collection.  The short liner notes tell a great tale of musical movie history and include all of his numerous award nominations and wins.  Each song (oddly enough) mentions the actors and the director, so fond are John Williams's memories of his work with these people.  All of the conductors are mentioned along with specific orchestras, choirs, arrangement and orchestration specialists and even the publishers (contractual, I am sure).  The only things missing are his early television scores, such as those for \\"Lost In Space\\" (by Johnny Williams back then).  But with four discs, one has nothing to complain about and everything to enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not much I can say about this series that almost 3,000 other reviews haven't already said. But I'll throw my two cents in, in hopes that another review will add a little more influence to the already steep pile of fans who pray we haven't seen the last of great shows like this in some form or fashion.     I had never heard of this series when it aired on TV. Not sure how I missed it because I am a huge Sci-fi fan. Perhaps FOX didn't have much faith in it and didn't promote it very well.   I just happened to stumble across this DVD set here on Amazon.  When I noticed over 2,000 people had reviewed it, I knew I had to take a closer look to see what this Firefly was all about, because I have never seen so many reviews for one product. Thus, based solely on word-of-mouth here, I took a leap of faith and purchased this set.  It was a leap well worth taking; my fall into Firefly was simply delightful!      Firefly did not  snatch me out of my seat immediately to catch my attention.  Instead, it's appeal snuck up on me slowly with it's clever writing, interesting people and quirky storylines.  Firefly is what you'd get if you mixed Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Stargate SG-1 and Star Trek all together, adding in a dash of Dr. Who and Tombstone.  Old West swagger  against a backdrop of sci-fi tech is a combination well worth watching.  Oh, you gotta love those western accents and Old West pronounciation of words.  Very \\"poetical\\". :-)      Generally speaking, it wasn't that each show was so fascinating that I was drooling over myself because I couldn't get enough. Rather, it was that each show drew me in a little deeper into their Serenity world and from all appearances, their world was one hellava place to be.  The best way I can describe Firefly is that it takes you on a fun ride you don't really want to get off of. But when it does end, you are ready to go around again.    I wish Firefly had aired on the Sci-fi channel instead of FOX because I think it would have survived longer...if not still. Firefly is a genre type show that belongs on a genre type channel. People who watch the Sci-fi Channel really get what shows like Firefly and Dr. Who are all about. I dare say if Dr. Who aired on network TV it probably would have been cancelled by now too. Not everyone wants to be transported to another world where your imagination guides the journey.  Thus, as with most sci-fi, either you get it or you don't--hardly with any middle ground in between.  Well, I definitely \\"get it\\" and I wish the execs out there in TV Land would \\"get it\\" too, and find a way to bring this wonderful cast and show back to TV.  Or at the very least, not messed it up the next time a series like this comes their way.
B000J103YI|5.0|My family and I are broadway fanatics and are very involved with the theater. Of course when we heard dreamgirls was being made into a movie we were thrilled. My mother saw Dreamgirls in 1982 with the original Effie White, Jennifer Holiday who of course was amazing. I unfortunatly only had the oppurtunity to hear her on the original soundtrack. We were of course sceptical as to if the movie soundtrack would live up to these high standards. Well from my opinion they have. Jennifer Hudson  sings a powerful and moving rendition of And I am telling you and I am changing. The overall soundtrack is definitly worth buying. (I am a tough critic) I cant wait to see the movie, judging buy the soundtrack it will be more than worth the ten dollar movie ticket!
0792839749|1.0|Having scanned all the reviews of this movie, and having read the book and seen the movie product myself (and oh boy, is it \\"product\\"), I can honestly say that you will either love this movie or you'll despise it.  No disrespect to the people who love it, it has it's moments of fun and is a rare family movie.  But to me it's a cloyingly sweet, over-the-top, Hollywoodized perversion of a great children's novel.  Oddly enough, Ian Fleming had a great innate understanding of children of Jeremy and Jemima's age and he treats their characters with a respect lacking in most adult novels about children.  In contrast, the movie is absolutely condescending to children, as bad as the nightmare babysitter who knew how to sweet-talk your parents but you could absolutely see through.  For those of you who love the movie, watch it in good health.  For those of you who can't hack the syrupy celluoid, find the original novel (I found a nice bound version through a used/rare bookseller site - take notice, Amazon) and read it together with your child.  Now that's an adventure you will really cherish!
B00005N6KG|5.0|This set of earphones has to be the best deal in town. They typcially cost about 10 dollars, yet they deliver very good sound quality. The very nice thing about them, too, is that they fit right inside your ear - delivering the sound where it is needed. They are great for just about any application including on a noisy airplane. The 'phones' are almost as good as those expensive so called \\"noise cancellation\\" sets. The only down side is that these earphones block out most other sounds around you as they fit rigt into the ear. I would not try walking in front of a train with a set on ... you might not hear it coming. These earphones are efficient and can provide proper sound levels from almost all audio devices. Again - a super deal!
B000255LIY|1.0|I'll admit that I'm a huge fan of the original.  Having said that, I did try to watch Lion2 without prejudice.  However, it was so bad that comparisons were just inevitable.  One disclaimer:  I couldn't finish watching this movie.  It was that bad. <br /> <br />The plot itself:  Yes, there were some changes but nothing major.  Some of the speeches were done in different places in the original (most of Geoffrey's lines).  I didn't find anything wrong with that at all. <br /> <br />Patrick Stewart as Henry II:  I really only got this movie because of him.  I love him as an actor and his roles are always played well.  Except for this.  His lines were delivered flippantly.  He played it like it was a tongue-in-cheek rendition. <br /> <br />Glenn Close as Eleanor:  Her acting was just bad.  She didn't seem to care about anything either.  It was as  if she memorized the lines but didn't understand what they meant, so the delivery was flat.  The lines needed a underlying venom or bite that was sadly lacking. <br /> <br />The boys:  Richard was just bad casting.  He was a weasely looking guy and he just came across as mean and surly.  There was no range with this character.  Geoffrey was close to right.  In his case it was just that he wasn't John Castle.  Prince John was just plain bad.  You could actually tell that he was  trying to act.  He was supposed to be a snivelling schemer, but the guy who played him in Lion2 played him as a buffoon. <br /> <br />Actually, throughout the movie the actors  were either quoting their lines by rote or they were fumbling along.  There was no FEELING anywhere or for anything, yet the events that transpired were supposed to be vitally important to all of them. <br /> <br />In the original, you could feel the love/hate between all the characters, especially Henry and Eleanor.  It was palpable.  In Lion2 there really is no emotion.   <br /> <br />As some have already stated, you could see that this whole production was done on a hollywoodset.  The original was dark and dank, like you would expect a medieval castle to be.  In Lion2 everything was fairly bright and cheery.  It set the wrong mood. <br /> <br />To sum up, on it's own Lion2 is just not very well acted.  Compared to the original, however, it's a travesty.  I would suggest skipping this one and seeing the original.
B000002IWH|5.0|Strong rock songs.  Pretty slow ballad.  The movies flash in my mind as I listen to each of the songs.  Need I say more?<br /><br />It's too bad the band's version of It Can't Rain All The Time isn't on the soundtrack.  Then the version that IS on the CD has lyrics 'It WON'T rain all the time'.  Jane Siberry's song is quite pretty & her voice very nice but if there actually was a whole song recorded it would have completed the soundtrack nicely.<br /><br />Could they have thought of this while making the film.  Maybe recording wasn't completed before the death of Brandon Lee?  Or did they wait until after Lee's death to release a version w/him singing to make post-death profits?  I won't be pessimistic.  I would have loved to have heard it if there were such a version.
B000I2JKC4|1.0|If Your looking for a REAL REVIEW; this movie is HORRIBLEY TRANSFERRED; 15% of the movie seems near HD quality. The opening cartoon is horrendously hazed with VHS quality coating. The sound is Dolby Digital 2CH not 5.1.... Honestly stick with the DVD version and put 20$ towards a True-HD movie like King Kong.... goto hddvd.org to read better reviews. By the way I own the Blu-Ray version and rented the HD-DVD version same quality... almost unwatchable at some points.... I am a fan of this movie and sour at wasting 20$... on a final note is does look better than the standard dvd but you wont be impressed trust me... please leave comments if you OWN the movie in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray
B00061S0QE|1.0|Incredibly overrated. <br />Lame. <br />Boring. <br />A huge disappointment. <br />Painful to sit through just a bit of it. <br />Not funny at all. <br /> <br />Should I say what I really think about it? <br /> <br />Just my opinion, I realize; but, IMHO, watching this movie is a waste of time, life, money, oxygen, space, etc. <br /> <br />An intriguing plot line that, unfortunately, goes nowhere....Repeat, absolutely nowhere. <br /> <br />So sad.... <br /> <br />I must confess that I am not 100% honest in my review...I actually feel the movie deserves no stars, or negative stars.  Unfortunately, that is not an option here at Amazon. <br />

B000002AH7|5.0|Miles Davis is my hero. How many people can say that they have dove deep into many forms of music as him? He combines only the greatest elements of music, into many genre dishes, quite like a chef who knows how to take some of the best ingredients, and make an incredible dish for you!<br /><br /> Sketches of Spain, is quite possibly one of this chef's greatest dishes ever served, with hints of solemnity here, and a dash of pizazz there. Miles Davis; with the help of Gil Evans concocts of the the best jazz albums in almost 50 years, and people still are ordering it. I has the right amount of Spanish spice to fill your night.<br /><br /> Doing some of the works of Joaquin Rodrigo on this album, was one of the brightest moves of Miles Davis' career. Rodrigo was an acclaimed Spanish musician, who had a hold of the regions heart with all of it's sensuous beauty and finesse, carefully captured by Mr. Davis ; et al. With the help of such songwriters as Mr. Rodrigo, Mr. De Falla, and Mr. Evans, this album shines greatly like the sun in Spain. The tracklist is as follows...<br /><br />1. Concierto De Aranjuez (Adagio)<br /><br />2. Will O' The Wisp<br /><br />3. The Pan Piper<br /><br />4. Saeta<br /><br />5. Solea<br /><br />6. Song Of Our Country<br /><br />7. Concierto De Aranjuez (Part One)<br /><br />8. Concierto De Aranjuez (Part Two Ending)<br /><br />This is a beautifully crafted piece of art, that every jazz fan should own.

B00000I9P0|3.0|Ok this movie is a 1986 cop action movie starring Stallone but the music makes a pretty good statement.  Many key parts of the movie are set to music from this soundtrack.  Songs to listen to are \\"Feel The Heat\\" and \\"Angel of the City\\" and the title track \\"Cobra\\"  Also \\"Voice of America's Sons.\\"  There are no superhits here but solid music for an ok movie.
B000LC4CVA|3.0|The girls that sing in this dvd are not really good, I was somewhat bored while watching some of the songs but mairead nesbitt is a very talented artist and her performance kept me glued to the tv, lisa kelly is also very good, the participation of these two artists is the only reason i bought the dvd and cd. <br /> <br />
B000HS28BY|5.0|I had a VHS of the movie for 27 years--showed it to HS Spanish classes every Spring for 27 years. It finally died and NOWHERE could I find another copy! AT LAST! Video Rarities to the rescue! Worth EVERY PENNY! Appeals to ALL AGES and genders! The boys like the sword fights and the girls love the romance! It's the only movie I can show where EVERY STUDENT STAYS AWAKE!!! And, they can tell you what happened! They pay attention! If they miss a day, they actually WANT to stay after school and watch it! Unreal! Thank you, Amazon and Video Rarities!!!
B0000024W3|1.0|Don't get me wrong, Bob is, quite simply, The Man. But nobody's perfect.<br /><br />In my mind, Dylan was kinda drifting from after the bike accident until Blood on the Tracks. He had sorta lost it, I guess. When you consider the best Dylan could offer during this period was mediocrity, especially after putting out SIX awesome discs in a row (Freewheelin'; Times They Are a-Changin'; Another Side of; Bringing It All Back Home; Highway Sixty-One Revisited; Blonde on Blonde) is disenheartening. To make things even worse, there are two good songs on this album, out of 24, no less. Quinn the Eskimo is the obvious highlight, plus It Hurts Me Too is a good blues cover. Then there are some of Bob's WORST SONGS EVER. Little Sadie; Take a Message to Mary; All the Tired Horses; I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know, The Boxer, Copper Kettle... you name it. Bob's put out mostly good music, with emphasis on \\"mostly\\". This is NOT an example.
0783231202|4.0|The staff reviewer for Amazon sure hated this movie, but I enjoyed it as a courtroom drama, based on a true case, from the early years of the USA. The slave defendants were serious underdogs in this battle, after having seized the ship which was bringing them to the New World and a new, unwanted life of misery. The case challenged America's fresh ideas as embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution: in a country which recently fought for the freedom of its own white citizens, yet allowed Negro slavery, could Negroes themselves fight for freedom before becoming owned by U.S. citizens? This is no masterpiece a viewer will want to enjoy again and again, but it is no waste of two hours on a snowy evening either. It engages heart and mind in a few profound political and religious questions.  <br /> <br />
B000000OSE|3.0|Okay, I'm still wondering something: Do we really need two CD's worth of this album? I mean, come on! Yeah, there's some coolness spread across this album: \\"November Rain\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\" are two more awesome lovestruck power ballads, \\"Live and Let Die\\" is arguably even better than Macca's because of Slash's heavy guitar, \\"Right Next Door to Hell\\", \\"Dust n' Bones\\", and \\"Perfect Crime\\" fill out the obligatory \\"kickass rock n' roll\\" quotient. And \\"Coma\\" is nicely epic and such. The biggest misstep is the acoustic country-twanger thing \\"You Ain't the First\\", which at least is mercifully brief, unlike the proceeding stupidity. Tell me, what was their justification for dragging slag like the Stones rip \\"Bad Obsession\\", misogynistic \\"Back off B*tch\\", psychedelic trash \\"In the Garden\\" (with Alice Cooper making a total fool of himself), and \\"Don't Damn Me\\", with Axl justifying his writing \\"One in a Million\\" by saying, \\"Sometimes I wanna kill\\" and \\"Sometimes I wanna destroy\\" (niiiiiiice. Now those two people in the world who previously didn't think you were an a** have changed their minds). And not only is he an a** (but you knew that), he's a friggin' hypocrite. \\"Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch\\", proclaims Mr. Axl \\"Immigrants and f*ggots/they make no sense to me\\" Rose. Hey buddy, by now everybody knows you hate anyone who isn't a straight American white guy, so why pretend otherwise? Who's gonna believe you? And guess what else? If you take what's good here, you get an economical single CD! Maybe it's a couple songs too few, but that's what we have those precious few good songs from Use Your Illusion II for!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|As Roger Ebert said in blurbing \\"An Inconvenient Truth,\\" - \\"You owe it to yourself to see this film.\\"  I'd add that you owe it to future generations as well. <br />Regarding the naysaying of the cause and effects of global warming, I'd recommend the book \\"The Heat Is On\\" by Ross Gelbspan.  Gelbspan has been dealing with the agents of big oil and king coal for years, and he exposes them quite effectively. <br />Even if we were to put aside all concerns about potential catastrophes from global warming - the ecological damage that is caused by oil and coal extraction is heartbreaking.  Books like \\"Resource Rebels: Native Challenges to Mining and Oil Corporations\\" by Al Gedicks go into the details.  Then there is the issue of \\"Peak Oil,\\" covered by the DVD \\"The End of Suburbia.\\" <br />Finally, for some hopeful news, I'd suggest the DVD \\"The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil.\\" <br />Additionally, there are all sorts of alternatives being developed here in the US.  Denver just hosted 13,000 architects, interior designers, land use planners and others for the \\"Green Build Expo\\" (it will be held in LA next year).  They know that green construction is not only good for the environment, but it's also good for business. <br />I hope Al Gore starts to emphasize the ways we can transition toward the next industrial revolution - the revolution that is outlined in books like \\"Natural Capitalism\\" by Paul Hawken.
0446604844|1.0|I read about 80 books a year, and this one was a TOTAL WASTE of time.  The main character, Sydney Archer, is a blonde dingbat.  Simpering and helpless one moment, she's Wonder Woman the next, demonstrating unbelievable prowess.  A really annoying character, one begins to hope that the bad guy wins.  The book goes all over the map with complicated interactions among a host of characters, but none of it is credible.  Don't waste your time.  Baldacci must have needed the money to write something this bad.
076790592X|5.0|This is a book about life. Its truly inspirational. Morrie is a man who found the true meaning of life and lived life in a good way and had a good life. Its a must for everyone!
0553804677|5.0|The fact that this book is a first effort by Scott Lynch is amazing in and of itself, however there are many authors with great first effort novels.  What I think is so amazing about this book is the fact that this story is one that could easily transcend the fantasy genre into mainstream appeal. <br /> <br />The story is written with a very quick wit, a compelling set of characters, especially the main protagonist of the book, and the story is a fun ride from beginning until end.  This is a story of intrigue, humor, friendship, good, evil and revenge. <br /> <br />Locke Lamora is a character who is multi faceted, he's a thief, but one of the \\"good guys\\" and you will find yourself very attached to him and his gang of \\"Gentlemen Bastards\\" and cheering for them as they battle the sinister forces arrayed against them.   <br /> <br />The style of the book has the story progressing in time, but spaced with interludes that go back and detail parts of Locke's life before the story takes place.  This ultimately increases the suspense of the book as the interludes keep you turning the pages.  In some books this would be frustrating, but in this book the interludes serve to illustrate things that are going to be relevant to the upcoming chapter.  It also continues to develop and define the characters in a way that would otherwise be tedious if done in a more straightforward manner. <br /> <br />I look forward to the upcoming series.  In this case, if you are a fantasy reader (or love suspenseful and entertaining novels!), put this book at the top of your list....even in hardcover.
0760748683|5.0|This is a nice copy of the book.  It has a built in ribbon bookmark and nice line drawing illustrations.  It is about 3 inches wide and 5 inches long (smaller than a standard book).  It is a very pretty version of the book though, and would be great as a gift.  Seems like it is well made.  It does have thin pages, but it doesn't seem problematic.
0553804677|5.0|I am an avid reader who had never heard of Scott Lynch. I ordered this book up on a capricious whim thinking it might be a fun read. But I was instantly mezmerized by this story. I knew by the tenth page that this would be one of the most developed books I will read this year. <br /> <br />And cover to cover it was wild. Lynch's characters are gloriously comprised, their plot wierdly thick and always their quick wit drips with honest humor. Read the Lies of Locke Lamora, learn to curse like thief in gentlemans clothes. I have nothing but praise for this book and I am  very happy to add it into my library. <br /> <br />
B00004YA66|5.0|The more I saw Garth Brooks's \\"When You Come Back to Me\\" video on TV, the more I wanted to see Frequency, although no ads had drawn me to it before I saw the video.  When the movie finally came out on video, I searched the town till I found a copy to rent.  That night, my roommates and I were glued to the screen.  One of my roommates, known for her sociability, actually postponed a phone conversation to catch the end of Frequency.  \\"I'm going to have to call you back!\\" she cried into the phone.  Of course, I bought the video as soon as I got the chance.<br /><br />More recently, my husband and I were walking in a store when I found a copy of Frequency on DVD for about $5.  I couldn't believe it and couldn't snap the movie up fast enough!  With its fascinating science fiction aspects, issues of emotion and morality, and spellbinding storyline, this is undoubtedly the best thriller I've ever seen.<br /><br />The bonus features on the DVD are nice, but the absence of Garth Brooks's music video was palpable on the VHS; the absence continues on this edition.  I'm not sure why the video is missing, but the movie is still a great buy!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I was only able to hear samples from the new CD however, I loved what I heard.  I am so very proud of her.  I am a recovering addict and I knew she could come back.  She has a foundation of Christ and all she had to do was tell satan that he was not going to claim her any longer.  Whitney just stay prayed up and allow God to order your footsteps.
B00004XQP4|5.0|For the life of me, I don't know why 'Misery' or 'Macy's Day Parade' didn't get airplay.  'Misery' is one of the best songs of all time in my opinion.  I'd put it up there in my top 5.  Fun song- reminds me of a musical.  Like in a Disney cartoon- I can picture Billie Joe singing in Aladdin, for some reason when I hear 'Misery'.  I like 'Macy's Day' more than 'Time of your Life'.  'Church on Sunday' is great too.  One of Green Day's best albums.  I personally like it better than 'American Idiot' but I'm probably the only one.
B000J4QWNQ|5.0|Okay, I've never seen any of the original tv series, being just a toddler in the 80's, so I'm not comparing this HD DVD release with it. I don't ever think I've seen a movie quite like this.  Honestly, Michael Mann is the main character in this. The cinematography is just amazing and it looks incredible in HD. All the shots, camera angles, etc, look killer.  <br /> <br />Like whenever there is a closeup of Crockett and Tubbs, it just looks cool and fitting. Farrell's  Sonny Crockett  looks like he stepped right out of the 80's, especially in the beginning scene in the rave/nightclub. The part where he's talking on his cell on the roof looks insane in HD. I almost think of this movie as \\"modern day 80's\\", if that makes sense. I think everyone should see this movie just to SEE it. Another success for Michael Mann.
B000002NZO|5.0|Haunting lyrics from a haunting band. Looking for someone? Found someone you have! Lyrically, Genesis second album, Trespass, is one of the best. Ground breaking for its time, Genesis paved the way for Progressive Rock with songs like The Knife and Visions of Angels. Unprecedented and unsurpassed, this is a Classic Rock staple.<br /><br />  The sound quality isn't the greatest, but this is an analog CD (AAD) copied from the master tapes. Get it before it's re-mastered. Sometimes CDs lose their original charm when they're digitally remastered and repackaged.
B000JJRIP2|3.0|The Best Buy in my town now is saying it's the customer's duty to call Universal Music at \\"the phone number listed inside the box set\\" to get Universal to mail us replacement discs. What's up with that? During my previous Best Buy visit, they said that yes, 13 replacement discs were en route to their store, but that none of the replacment discs had been received in ANY of Best Buy's regional stores around here. What's up? Please enlighten me ...
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I bought this CD after much debate. The first time I heard \\"Wind It Up\\" on the radio, I didn't like it, but by the end of the first time hearing it, I wanted to hear it again. That song grew on me, then I decided to purchase the album. To my surprise, I loved the entire album! I find myself singing the songs in my head throughout the day at work, then I get home and listen to it. It's a great disc, one that will stay in my player for quite some time to come. If you like music that's usually on the radio, you'll love the whole album. I could see every song on here being released as a single hit!
B00005JLT5|5.0|Winner of the Golden Palm, should have taken home the Oscar, `The Pianist' is, in my humble opinion, the best film of 2002.  It's one of those films that truly speaks to me on so many levels and resonates with me long after I'm done watching it.  Adrien Brody's masterful performance was rightly rewarded during that years Oscar ceremony, as was Roman Polanski's brilliant directing and Ronald Harwood's excellent screenplay.  The heart of this film, of course, is found in Adrien's performance, a tour'de'force as they call it. <br /> <br />Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist who is on the cuff of fame when the Nazi's invade Warsaw and he's forced into hiding.  `The Pianist' chronicles Wladyslaw's perilous journey and sheds light on those who helped him along the way, those who put him up, provided for him and even those who left him to die.  One reviewer noted that this is merely a story of one man's survival, and they alluded to the fact that that was a bad thing.  I disagree for it's a wonderful testament to the will to survive, that will in each and every one of us.  Just because Wladyslaw may not have done anything overly important with his life doesn't mean that his heartbreaking and uplifting story needn't be told.  <br /> <br />`The Pianist' helps the viewer to realize the horrors of the holocaust, the fact that more than what you think you know happened.  An example of this is found when a group of Jews are stopped while they are marching to work.  They are all lined up and a few men are randomly selected from the group and executed.  This is an act I never gave to much thought to.  I think for the most part when we think about the holocaust we think about the concentration camps, which were awful in themselves, but even outside those walls these people were treated horribly.  Even just the constant mocking and random beatings are a true testament to the atrocity that was that dark time in human history. <br /> <br />As a side note I wanted to mention that, while he's only in a few minutes of the film, Thomas Kretschmann pulls out such a moving performance towards the end of this epic film.  As Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, Kretschmann shows so much emotional weight in his few frames as a man who feels pity for Szpilman and his condition and helps him the best he can.  There's one scene in particular when both Brody's and Kretschmann's eyes alone speak volumes.  Just after they meet Hosenfeld tells Wladyslaw to play something for him on the piano.  That scene alone carries the emotional crutch of this film, for in Wladyslaw we see this fear and pain as he begins that slowly transforms to this remarkable release and in Hosenfeld we see this admiration and concern that comes over him.   <br /> <br />Other supporting actors that must be recognized are Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman who play Wladyslaw's parents as well as Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner and Jessica Kate Meyer who play his siblings Henryk, Regina and Halina respectively.  Michal Zebrowski, Ruth Platt, Ronan Vilbert and Emilia Fox, among others, show beautifully that some humans do indeed care for more than just themselves as they play a few of the people that try to help this man survive. <br /> <br />I don't understand how anyone couldn't be touched by this remarkable film.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This is the first Jack Johnson cd that i bought and i was blown away.<br /><br />The guy is insanely talented. If you have'nt heard any Jack Johnson then<br /><br />you're missing a real treat. It's hard not to like the man. If you buy<br /><br />only one cd this year it should be this one. If you love laid back GOOD<br /><br />music then you'll love this guy. I firmly believe that music makes everything better. If i were getting stabbed in the face, even that<br /><br />would be a better experience if i had some Jack Johnson playing in the<br /><br />backgroung......I own most everything that he's put out to date....
B000JJRIN4|5.0|i think this album is soo awsome. i love the place that gwen has come to. if you were attracted to solo gwen for her 80's influeces and revival than you should be impressed with her totally outragous developement. this album is truely outragous. this album sounds nothing like hollarbac girl. gwen mixes her honest diary like lyrics, with sick beats and awsome 80'z replicas!!!  there are also slight and obvious touches of musical aspects... the obvious elements in \\"wind it up\\"... and the subtle way she speak sings the lyrics of \\"u started it\\".
0307237699|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think my view of Barack was indifferent until I read his book.  He an idealist, a populist (like Lou Dobbs), a man for the people.  I think he is very sincere.  The fact that he still has hope and can articulate that 'HOPE' is refreshing.  Whether you're a Republican or Democratic-Barack is breath of fresh air. I don't know if he can win the Presidency, but he's got a good chance.  Read the book and judge for yourself.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|The Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Special Edition DVD is worth the purchase if you compare it to the first DVD release of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang which is utterly devoid of special features.  If you like musicals like The Sound of Music, The Wizard of Oz and especially Mary Poppins I believe you'll also find a place in your heart for this film.  It is certainly a must for someone who is a fan of the Sherman Brothers song writing team.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I actually didn't get to see any of the first season; I just started watching in the 2nd season and was immediately hooked. After buying this on DVD, I tried to savor this season and stretch it out as much as I could, but I just couldn't...I think I had it all watched within one weekend. Every episode just reeks awesomeness and is hilarious. This is one of my all-time favorite shows and I think it has a very bright future. This is a must-see for anyone who claims to like good comedy, because this is it, no doubt about it.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|Lovely bones would appeal to most readers looking for an enjoyable easy read. The narrative voice is that of Susie Salmon, brutally murdered at 14, now suspended in her version of heaven . She longingly watches her family (as they unravel in the aftermath of her death) and the lives of others whom she had touched ....a blossoming crush, an awkward prescient loner ... and of course her murderer. It's a potent & moving combination of  Susie's unfulfilled hopes and dreams,  family drama, the frustrating prolonged hunt for her killer. Don't let the grim subject matter put you off because Sebold's Susie carries the story well. Lovely Bones lost out on my fifth star due its cliched moments in the later half - a real pity.  Nevertheless it was such a page turner, both refreshing and thought-provoking. Worth a good weekend at home.
B00005JPCA|3.0|At the outset, I must admit that I am not a keen follower of the cult of James Bond.  I have only ever seen one James Bond movie prior to \\"Casino Royale\\" and have only vague recollections of reading \\"Thunderball\\" in my teens.<br /><br />Overall, I was probably underwhelmed by this film.  Lots of action, much of it very spectacular, and little in the way of dialogue.  Typical Hollywood style stuff that has been done a thousand times before.  If action is your turn on then see this film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig in the lead role is probably a good choice.  I remember seeing Craig in \\"Layer Cake\\" a few years ago and he stole the show.  I must admit that Craig is a far more realistic action figure than Roger Moore.  Does he surpass Sean Connery?  Well, that is a choice that I will leave to the aficionados.<br /><br />On a lazy Sunday afternoon, \\"Casino Royale\\" is a pleasant way to spend a few hours.  Don't see it to be challenged.
0446677450|5.0|This is the best of the series. I haven't read all of them, but I have made my way through most of them, so far, this is the only one able to paint a picture in your mind and shifting your thinking frame. It's not a HOW-TO book by any means, (i don't think any of his are)but it does help you see things from a different point of view, which at times it's much more valuable.
0609610570|5.0|Execution, The Discipline of Getting Things Done, will help you think and manage like a winner! The book is exactly what one would expect from a former GD Exec (Bossidy) an advisor to Blue Chip CEO's (Ram).  The essence of the book is to show how to link three of the most important parts of an organization, People, Strategy and Operations, to create a competitive, agile, team that produces results. The book ties in many themes that were in Jack Welch's Winning. The lessons are taught in the context of a manufacturing business, which doesn't really relate to my field but it was very easy to draw the parallels.  <br /> <br />I have to admit that when I started reading the book I almost put it back on the shelf because it didn't quite engage me. My one complaint is that some of the chapters seemed long making the material difficult to absorb at times. Overall, I am glad I kept reading because I got some great insight into the ways of successful companies and leaders.  <br />
B000JLTRKE|1.0|If you enjoy watching Nic Cage buried in debris for most of the movie while cutting to the various soap opera like goings on above ground - then you'll probably love this horrible film. One would think after the Alexander debacle, Oliver Stone would rebound - he's nowhere to be found in this film. This is moviemaking as bad as it gets, plain and simple! See United 93 for a film worth seeing on this subject (the day the world changed for America). It's hard to believe they even released this movie to the public viewing.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Gilda is one of those Hollywood treasures I can watch over and over again, it's like a favorite song.<br /><br />Rita Hayworth's performance is that of which legends are made. Every man wants her, every woman wants to be her. Glen Ford as Johnny Farrall is at his most handsome and his performance is equally as good as Rita's although after the first shot of Gilda flipping her hair back at her vanity all eyes remain on her.<br /><br />The character of Gilda didn't show up in the film until about 30 minutes into the movie, that tells you how much faith they had in Ms Hayworth as the star. Her rendition of  \\"Put The Blame On Mame \\" was the highlight of the movie for me, using her hair and hips as weapons she seduced the world. The chemistry between she and Ford is electric, Bogart was originally supposed to play Johnny Farrall but once he found out Rita Hayworth would be playing Gilda he told them \\"no thank you\\" With Hayworth in the movie no one will look at me. I'm  glad he bowed out because I  cant imagine Gilda without Ford.<br /><br />This movie is pure film noir gold a must have for any movie buff.
0525948023|5.0|This masterpiece expands upon the Power of Now with elegance, beauty and truth. I will be rereading this the rest of my life. Thank you Eckhart.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is one of the few movies I actually own, and it has been worth it. I have watched this film numerous times, and have loved it equally every time. The story is so simple, and yet so beautifully done. It is great to have a film that is simultaneously artistic and unpretentious.
0060899190|4.0|Except for the Forward and Introduction, the contents of this book are entirely reproductions of postcards sent anonymously to PostSecret.  As such, this book isn't a story, but rather a collection of glimpses into people's secret lives.  Many of these secrets are sad, some are quite joyful, and s few are more than a little disturbing.  But the secrets themselves are only part of the impact.  The artwork that adorns the postcards is quite moving as well, spanning the range from simple, child-like figures to complex compositions.  Many of these postcards took a great deal of careful thought and preparation.<br /><br />As I worked my way through the book, looking at the various postcards, I found myself trying to create the stories that went with these snippets of people's personal lives.  I can understand some of them easily, others were a stuggle, but in the end, I found a great deal of empathy with these people who needed to tell someone about their secret, even if it had to be done anonymously with a post card.
B000J103YI|5.0|I did not think anyone could come close to Jennifer Holiday but Jennifer Hudson sure does sounds amazing! I remember watching American Idol: Season 3 and immedietly fell in love with Jennifer Hudson. I was so upset when she got kicked off and felt robbed that she had to go so soon. I knew she would do something big and here she is!! She is by far the standout star on this soundtrack!!<br /><br />There are quite a few good songs on this soundtrack that are great. Beyonce's \\"Listen\\" is a fantastic song, which Beyonce specifically wrote for this movie. She does a great job in this song with her vocals.<br /><br />The Jennifer Hudson songs are BY FAR the peak of this CD. \\"And I am Telling You\\" and \\"I Am Changing\\" are both PHENOMENAL!! They both give me goosebumps.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this musical, any of these artists or of the original songs then this soundtrack is for you!!<br /><br />Remember the name Jennifer Hudson - this is just the beginning for her.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Please, return to NO DOUBT to get your mojo back!    This album is only suited for football halftime shows.    Does she SING anymore?     And \\"Orange County Girl\\" sounds like a bad Brooke Hogan imitation.    The song lyrics say it all:    .....Don't know what I'm doin' back in the studio  .....Gettin' greedy 'cause he said he had another sick flow  .....So I had to hold my back, guess I didn't get enough    She called this one in.     * * * U P D A T E * * *    Over the months the album really grew on me, I like about 4 of  the songs, and the others I can respect for being experimental.    Can't wait until the new ND record comes out.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|What an amazing movie.  I purchased this for my kids, but whenever it is playing, I find myself plopping down on the sofa with them. Like most of the other Miyazaki movies I've seen, the animation is a gorgeous feast for the eyes; there's simply nothing like it among today's crop of computer generated animated fare. <br /> <br />Beyond the rich visuals, I think the storyline of Nausicaa translates for American audiences better than many of the other Studio Ghibli productions. A more serious work than Totoro, making it appealing for older kids, it also avoids some of the more graphic and at times startling images and themes found in Princess Mononoke and Sprited Away, although I was a little surprised when I first realized that Nausicaa apparently wears no underpants. <br /> <br />The actors who dubbed the English version all acquit themselves nicely, making the dialogue merge effortlessly with the images.   <br /> <br />A wonderful movie.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Wow, I can't stop listening to this CD! It's so good. I love his voice, his guitar playing is amazing and the lyrics are so soulful. Currently I have Continuum downloaded, but I am definately buying the CD for Christmas, it's a must!

B000929AJQ|5.0|When an artist makes a cd and especially if they go in a totally new direction which in my opinion reznor did with this Cd<br /><br />you have to give some credibility for taking such a risky decision.<br /><br />On top of that Trent Reznor isn't as pissed as he used to be...which necessarily doesn't mean its a bad thing but an eye opener<br /><br />and a door to new things to come..<br /><br />This cd is just the begginning in my opinion of the best yet to come<br /><br />NIN has always surprised everyone and I seriously disagree with those that say they have lost their edge or aren't as hard as they are<br /><br />cause if you go see them live like I did this yrs at \\"With Teeth\\" tour you'll realize that they're back even harder and better<br /><br />I honestly think the new line-up is excellent and Trent still gots it.
0446528056|5.0|I couldn't wait for Sparks to come out with a new book and just happened to walk into Barnes & Noble and saw it calling my name. I absolutely loved this book, maybe it was because I had a recent interaction with someone in the services, i'm not sure, but it truly hit home.  I could understand exactly how the characters felt I wanted to laugh with them, cry with them, and just scream, don't do it follow you're heart. This book truly shows you that if you love someone you will do whatever it takes to make their happiness come true. <br /> <br />Make sure you read it!!
B00004BZ16|5.0|Sandinista! was The Clash's response to the two-album set - The River - released by Bruce Springsteen. In what was a growing row with the record company after the smashing success of London Calling, The Clash wanted the financial backing to issue three records for the cost of a single lp and to promote it in the U.S. with only a few gigs.<br /><br />Yes, The Clash wanted to outdo The Boss be being it's own boss. And was it meeting the new boss who was the same as the old boss? Forget it.<br /><br />In 36 tracks The Clash delivers music from the city streets. Through biting lyrics like those in Somebody Got Murdered & Police On My Back, repression and desolation is depicted in living color.<br /><br />There aren't too many releases that packed the power in four consecutive songs like Washington Bullets, Broadway, Lose This Skin and Charlie Don't Surf. Replace the arcade sounds with a soundtrack from a video game & toss in the \\"bad guy\\" of the moment and Ivan Meets G.I. Joe becomes a timely classic from the new resource wars. And my favorites remain The Magnificent Seven and Hitsville U.K.<br /><br />I am sure The Clash was under pressure to deliver London Calling II and it can be argued that pairing Sandinista! down to about 12 tracks would have made for an absolutely brilliant album. But by taking the record company for a ride, The Clash showed for a brief period of time how music can reach out to the fans and speak through them, not to them.
B00008H2LB|5.0|It was around 2003 that I became a major Linkin Park fan, and it was because of people overbashing them on a message board.  I decide to really see if they were worth the hate.  After downloading a couple of their songs, I decided 2 years later to buy Meteora. <br /> <br />First off, I don't conisder Linkin Park to be metal.  I just see them as a hard rock band.  Metal would be something like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Dragonforce, Dream Theater, you know...  What I like about LP is how they take elements of hard rock, rap, and electronica, and blend it together to form a new music.  My only flaw though is that they could sing about different things instead of just angst. <br /> <br />Second off, the band isn't emo.  IMO, it's just that a lot emo kids listen to LP.  But emo kids aren't the only ones though who listen to this.  Emo would be something like Hawthorne Heights and some of those pop punk bands. <br /> <br />Anyways, here's my review on the songs: <br /> <br />1 - Foreword\\" - N/A, it's just an intro for the next song <br />2 - Don't Stay - 9.5/10, decent song to start off with.  It has a nice hip-hopish beat to it as well and really should be remixed. <br />3 - Somewhere I Belong - 9/10, good <br />4 - Lying from You - 9.3/10, despite some screaming, Shinoda does well with the rap and I like that instrument in the beginning too. <br />5 - Hit the Floor - 2/10, easily my least favorite from the album <br />6 - Easier to Run - 9.7/10, I don't see why people try to compare this to Crawling (which I found to be over-rated).  There isn't really blaring vocals like in Crawling...it's just a simple song which I found to come out much better than Crawling <br />7 - Faint - 9.2/10, I like the beat to the song, but a little too much yelling, especially during the bridge.  Face it, you ain't beating Disturbed's Down With The Sickness for the best yelling sequence ever. <br />8 - Figure.09 - 9.5/10, once again another song that stands out <br />9 - Breaking the Habit - 10/10, one of my 3 favorite songs from the album.  No rap, no blasting/distorting guitars, none of it at all.  Chester actually sings quite well in this song.  Oh, and it's probably about drug addiction... <br />10 - From the Inside\\" - 10/10, this song grew on me due to the music video that came with it.  Something different here as the song is set to a triple meter.  Some yelling may hurt some listeners though. <br />11 - Nobody's Listening\\" - 5.5/10, eh creativity was there, but it just wasn't that interesting...maybe should have made it longer and improved the chrous a little bit. <br />12 - Session - 6/10, well, it's weaker than Cure for the Itch <br />13 - Numb - 10/10, easily my favorite from this album. <br /> <br />Linkin Park may not be for everyone but it's quite ignorant to hate a band just because they are on MTV.  I never bothered much with MTV after they stopped showing music.  Sometimes, the good music will be on the radio.  Other times, you'll have to go underground.  Meteora IMO is Linkin Park's crowning achievement, and I was able to absorb all the songs in just a couple of sittings unlike their first album which took a while.  If you are looking for pure metal, stay back from this album or you'll be dissapointed.  If you enjoy alternative rock and don't mind rap, take this album.
0743454537|5.0|This is the 1st and only book I have ever read by Picoult and it blew me away. This has become one of my favorite books to reach for read over and over again. The characters are human and complex, you'll love them and hate them, but understand what makes them tick. <br />I am not going to give away the story but if you're the type that likes perfect happy endings, this may not be the book for you. If you want a good novel that is honest, although heart wrenching, this was a great read. It made me cry and it made me angry but I loved it anyway.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Even though they run it on regular TV every year, the original with all the off color humor can't be beat.  It's a family tradition in our house.  A great, great movie with a great message.

0743243315|2.0|I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance!

B00005ONMJ|4.0|....and isn't the last finale (after the Don goes to hell) missing in this performance (or was that a bad print I saw once)? If so, how could all of my fellow critics ignore that fact?  <br />This is the 19th-century conception of the Don, as one critic here writes, as a tragic figure. How heroic he is, realizing the bravado won't work, at last. Perhaps Mozart \\"was of the devil's party without knowing it,\\" to borrow a phrase, and the Don's spectacular death is a tribute to a fine composer writing a great if melodramatic scene. <br />But if one doesn't see this opera as a comedy, what's the point? However humanely the Don's victims are portrayed, isn't there something ridiculous there, too? The buffa element is even more entrenched than in \\"Figaro,\\" which I find the more perfect work, if one has to fling that term around. And dear Leporello, after all the trauma, asks only for \\"a better master\\" at the very end. Like all comedy, everything really does end up as it was at the beginning - the Don has provided a spanner in the works, but no one puts up that big a defense - except a dead man on a horse (now THAT's realistic). <br />This is a filmed stage production, not a film. The sound is fine for the period; the singing has been well described by others here. The filming of the overture shows the limitations from the beginning - and does Furtwaengler look uncomfortable, or what. It is a bit slow, although the pace is consistent. But was it really necessary to let that moment when the Ottavio looks at the director and shrugs his shoulders before going back into character slide? Argh. (Or is my memory faulty here, perhaps?) <br />I guess I'm spoiled by a Mozartean like Bergman, who really gave us a FILM of an opera. He is not alone. Peter Sellars has many advocates. And yes, singing aside, there are many flawed elements in most opera films, whether technical or interpretive. Let's be grateful that these singers and this conductor left a record for us. But to claim this to be the best opera FILM ever is to be really blinded by its history.
B000JLTRJ0|4.0|Oliver Stone, known for his wild conspiracy-laden film JFK, the ultra-violent Natural Born Killers or Vietnam centered Platoon, directs this film and unless you took off the credits and everything, you probably couldn't tell he did this. No shift from color to black and white, no hyper camera or politics. So don't think this film is meant to be a big rant against terrorists, or even America for its politics or, I must admit they show sometimes, their arrogance. Instead what we get is just simply a first-hand account of 2 caught in the rubble, as well as the families that were on pins and needles waiting by a phone. <br /> <br />September 11, 2001, a day like any other like the opening scenes show us. 2 cops, John McCoughlin and Will Jimenez go to work only to hear of a plane hitting one of the towers at the World Trade Center. In they go, as well as other officers, to rescue those trapped in the buildings until both towers collapse. Miraculously they survive but are trapped and severely injured. We follow both men struggling to live out of sight and unable to move. We also switch to their wives, John's wife Donna and Will's wife Allison as they wait impatiently for news on their husbands. <br /> <br />One commonly asked question at the time, and even a song title by Alan Jackson, was \\"where were you?\\" Me, I was in Math class until I had a spare at 10:30 that took me right to lunch. As I was walking to the stairway to go downstairs and out the door, I heard one student say they \\"bombed the Pentagon\\" but I thought crazy kids always talking about movie plots or just being weird. It wasn't until I looked on a website at home that it was the top story. Turned on the TV and there it was. One thing I hated was the TV coverage. Seeing each plane slam into one of the towers every 7 seconds from different angles was a bit much: over 100 lives on each plane not to mention those in the vicinity of where they hit gone in a few seconds. Then of course we have the collapse which they replayed again. Thankfully this film doesn't show them from a filmmaking perspective, putting them on news report or sounds. Oddly the highlight even though it sounds morbid is when they towers collapse with the officers inside: it's incredibly harrowing and powerful really even if it doesn't last as long as I would like. The film suffers from a Catch-22 though: switching back and forth from the families to the 2 officers is a bit jarring even though both would work fine on their own. Seeing 2 cops who can't move talk to each other for an hour and a half would've been kind of boring but when they switch, it's like \\"hey put it back!\\" <br /> <br />One thing that happened a lot before the film came out was people asking whether it was too soon to make this. Oddly, this is the 4th film I can recall about 9/11 specifically: Flight 93, United 93, the Great New Wonderful and this film. It doesn't really feel early for me. Instead it feels like a film that was doomed by the public before it even premiered(didn't help that star Maggie Gylennhaal made a comment about America and 9/11 that America was in a way responsible. This of course was highly offensive to them, especially New Yorkers but it does feel like what the film's reaction was too: mention 9/11 and a shield is set up, preventing anyone from talking about it in any way. Stone manages to for once be non-political and presents a simple straight-forward story. <br /> <br />Recently I bought the extended edition of King Kong, the third release to feature extensive background info on the making of the film, the other 2 being the original 2-disc as well as the Production Diaries set. While the film was rather lackluster, the amount of attention paid to the making-of suggests that they obviously loved making the film, just to bad the finished product wasn't as well as it should've been. Same thing with the Some Kind of Monster documentary, chronicling Metallica's recording of the much-maligned St. Anger album. It's not that World Trade Center is bad, far from it, but what this film could've been and seeing the special features makes it clear this film could've been incredibly moving. <br /> <br />It's a film that I admire but I find it hard to love. That said, this is not a cinema blemish and it's at times a very effective film.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|\\"The Covenant\\" is a story of four friends - descendants of notorious \\"witch families\\" who had to go underground in the XVII century after people started being burned in neighboring Salem. The friends, as well as their ancestors, have to hide their supernatural abilities using them only for fun - to cheat playing pool or to lift up girls' skirts. They all study in some privileged school and have a good time there until two new students arrive - a pretty girl and a noddy guy. From this moment on the atmosphere in the college starts being tense.<br /><br />I like Renny Harlin a lot. In my opinion he's one of the greatest artisans in Hollywood especially among foreign directors. He never made anything brilliant, but managed to create movies that general audience would like (as well as other European and Asian directors in Hollywood). His \\"Die Hard 2\\", \\"Cliffhanger\\", \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" and \\"Mindhunters\\" were spectacular and fascinating, Renny Harlin was a brand to attract moviegoers to theaters, at least I was attracted every time. \\"The Covenant\\" is exactly this kind of a story - nothing special, but given nice F/X, good acting and stylish directing by Harlin it could become quite liveable. I wasn't even expecting anything over the top - just a decent entertainment.<br /><br />But even Renny Harlin couldn't save it. The story turned out to be so poor and just not able to interest someone, that directing talent was misspent. I don't know why Harlin decided to direct a movie with J.S.Cardone's script in the first place - I don't remember anything good coming out from under this man's pen. And \\"The Covenant's\\" story is so boring, so unemotional and tame, even Spielberg wouldn't do anything nice about it. It's not even good entertainment - simply dull. Young actors are all indistinguishable and you spend the first half of the film trying to remember who's who. Besides the plot isn't new at all, there are no interesting twists and unexpected revelations. There's only one decent scene in the whole movie. So here's the conclusion: even a good director can't make a good picture if the screenplay is lame.<br /><br />This disaster of a movie is quite embarrassing particularly after intense and breathtaking \\"Mindhunters\\". I hope Renny Harlin will be chosing scripts wiser from now on.ecent scene in the whole movie.

B00005JPCA|4.0|Typically I expect much out of a James Bond movie. I'm a big fan, no question about it. Bond is the ultimate action hero of our time: tough, cold, obsessed with disposable technology and women, ever evolving and yet never truly progressing. Plus the action scenes are usually pretty cool. And within the world of Bond I particularly look forward to the first films of new Bond actors. With these entries there is often a return to basics, a rejection of the more ridiculous extremes of Bond and an embracement of the stripped down basics that made the series great in the first place. \\"Goldeneye\\" was such a film and was one of the best Bond films to date. The Pierce Brosnan films quickly went downhill from there, but that first film was concise, rudimentary, and great. So I was excited by the prospect of a new Bond, especially Daniel Craig, who looked as thought he would bring something new to the role. I was also excited that \\"Casino Royale\\" would be the fist Bond movie made from an Ian Fleming story since \\"The Living Daylights\\". I was hoping for a stripped down Bond, a movie reliant more on characters and basic action, rather than space rays or whatever. And I was not disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" works because it does stick to many of the basics. It works well because it goes so far as to even play with many of those basics. Bond is tough, but not ridiculously so, and he relies more on actual human ability to get the job done, rather than crazy gadgets or near superhero level strength. Daniel Craig, who is of course going to be carefully eyed up by most, does a great job to my opinion. He's unique enough to make the part his own and yet classic enough to fill what has already been established. He has a charming smirk and screen presence enough, plus a rough enough edge to make the character interesting. He'll do. The story is generally enjoyable, involving Bond's mission to disrupt the efforts of an international terrorist investor. Some elements annoyed me, such as the upgrading of the classic Bond baccarat to the trendier Texas Hold `Em, but for the most part it was classic Bond. The plot falls apart about three quarters of the way through the film, and it seemed as though the filmmakers wanted to do more with the characters and plot than the film could really handle, but these missteps are generally an exception.<br /><br />What is truly enjoyable about the film is the way in which, in an effort to refresh the series, it is willing to play with many of the Bond staples. There is no Q, no crazy gadgets. The most offered is a rather snazzy storage system for a defibulator. The classic lines are played with, as are the standard relationships between Bond and M, Moneypenny (or is it Moneypenny?), and other stock Bond characters. All of this is handled well and I enjoyed the way the film tried to stay true to roots and yet offer more than the standard fair. The filmmakers and writers obviously see potential still present in the series, and they have made a solid case of this. They give us a grittier Bond, thanks in part to Craig, but also due to a determination to make the 22nd or whatever entry in the series seem fresh and different. The film has some edge to it and thanks to a 9/11 reference and some terrorism related plot points even slight relevance. Or at least as much relevance as you can ask an ubermasculin action film to have.<br /><br />So Bond is back and Craig is the man for the job and blah, blah, blah. What it comes down to is that the film is entertaining. It takes the best of Bond, utilizes it well, and sheds all the over-the-top filler that so many other Bond films, and most modern action films in general, are plagued by. \\"Casino Royale\\" sticks to gambling, guns, and girls and is the better for it. The action scenes are exciting and original, the outrageous stunts and explosions kept to a minimum, the women are gorgeous, the men treacherous, and when all is said and done the audience is happy. Or at leastI was.at least I was.
B000002KK2|5.0|Buy this CD alone for Company and The Last Chance Texaco; You will be glad you did. They don't make them like this anymore. Rickie Lee and Joni Mitchell are the last of a dieing breed.

0465068359|4.0|This book was shocking in at least two ways.  First, the atrocities committed by the Japanese against the people of Nanking is enough to make you put the book down in despair.  And if reading it wasn't difficult enough, there are also some very graphic pictures, to leave nothing to the imagination as to how these poor people suffered.<br /><br />The second shock was the very fact that I had never even heard of this event until just a few months ago.  I don't believe it was ever discussed in a high school or college class I took.  If so, it had to be only a cursory mention, because I had no idea this tragedy ever took place until a friend told me about it recently.  Wanting to know more, I read this book.<br /><br />The author, Iris Chang, does a fine job of telling the story.  As someone of Chinese descent, it had to be very painful for her, but it also served as her motivation, because she was correct in understanding that many people were not aware of what happened in Nanking.  In short, the Japanese took it upon themselves to exploit, torture and kill the Chinese population of Nanking.  No clear reason is ever given.  Was it just because they were at war?  Because China and Japan are ancient enemies?  Who knows?  Who cares?  Nothing could be considered a legitimate reason for what took place.  There appears to be some disagreement about the number of Chinese killed in this massacre.  200,000?  300,000?  400,000?  Again, does it matter?  Simply put, no.<br /><br />What does matter is that human beings can actually treat other human beings (or even other living creatures) in such a vile and disgusting way.  Many people remember the Nazis as horrible, and they absolutely were.  Unfortunately, we have yet another example that the Nazis are not alone when it comes to man's inhumanity to man.<br /><br />Four stars.  This is a painful but necessary story, one that deserves much more attention than it has received.
B0000AK7AC|5.0|I'm a 22 year old guy, and I love this flick, it's great family fun, and Even I like it haha.  It's got a ton of adorable animals and a pretty good story line.  A must have if you have any kid under 13 years old, or just dorky kids like me!!
0375701427|3.0|I found this book more and more difficult to read as it progressed.  Too much time spent inside the Swede's head sharing his doubts and questions.  At about the 3/4 mark, I was finding myself becoming impatient and annoyed with the main character.  So much so, that when his brother unleashes a verbal tirade on him about his lack of a backbone, I was in total agreement.  I was hoping that exchange was going to lead to some kind of action by the Swede, but he just chalked it up to jealousy on his brothers part, because everybody loves the Swede.  He even began to repeat himself and it became like listening to a relative telling a story you've heard before. <br /> <br />As for the supporting characters, I found his wife Dawn to be shallow and unlikable and his father to be a bit overbearing.  The most interesting characters, his daughter Merry and his nemesis Rita Cohen, were simply not given the development that would have made this a much richer reading experience.

B000E33VWW|4.0|This is a very leisurely paced film, but rewarding for the patient and open-minded viewer.  Hoffman gives a deservedly Oscar winning performance.  Even though i'm a big Keener fan, I didn't see why her performance also got such high praise.  Must be something really subtle about it that got past me. <br /> <br />The best part of this movie for me is that it got me interested in reading the book and seeing the movie 'In Cold Blood'.  I was also previously unaware of how the experience of writing it affected Capote and that he never completed another book. I'd recommend this as a rental rather than a purchase, if only to see Hoffman's performance.
0451209338|5.0|This not a thriller if that's what your looking for...it's about an assassin but it's not like thrilling. It's a fun read with lots of adventure and intrigue. My mother recommended it to us to read so that we can have some variety since we get so caught up in series and don't get around to reading anything else...this book provides a good quick break.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|skip through every single song and go straight to the last track, \\"wonderful life\\". it is the only great song on this cd. it doesn't sound like it even belongs on this album. the rest of the album is weak. very weak. i dont know what happened but i fnd it hard to beleive that this is the same talent that fronted no doubt and released an excellent solo album 2 years ago. i'm at a loss for words.
B0000047EC|4.0|Pat Metheny continued his series of collaborations in 1997 with long-time friend Charlie Haden.  The songs are almost all Americana.  Each note is chosen carefully, and as such, it became a commercially successful album.  Is it \\"lite\\" or \\"elevatory\\"?  Mostly, no.  Theres a point nearer the end where my attention lags, but generally the songs have the content jazz fans want.  The songs are a mixture of originals and covers.  There aren't exactly jazz standards, but country or folk standards.  The CD starts off very strong, and stays that way until \\"Tears of Rain\\", but the CD ends on a good note with \\"Spiritual\\".  Metheny plays a few guitar synth overdubs, but they aren't essential, nor do they take away from the majesty of the performance.
B00005JKHN|5.0|\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was one of my favorite Disney animations when I was little, along with \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". Watched it quite a few times, and know all the words to all the songs, and pretty much all the dialogue, both of which are pretty good. <br /> <br />A princess, Aurora, is born, and three fairies come with gifts to give. Only two, beauty and song, are given. The sorceress Malificent interrupts the ceremony, and gives a gift of her own, a promise that when Aurora touches the spindle of a spinning wheel on her sixteenth birthday, she will die. Luckily, the third of the fairies, Merryweather, has her gift to give, and she counters the spell. If the princess does prick her finger, she will fall into sleep rather than death, and can be awoken with true love's first kiss. Still, the King is not convinced, and has every spinning wheel burnt, and the fairies take the child into the forest, to be raised as a peasant under the name of Rose. Will this be enough, or will Malificent get her way? <br /> <br />The animation and scenery has a medieval flavor, while the augmented Tchaikovsky score and additional songs really add to the atmosphere. The sorceress Malificent is probably my favorite Disney villain, she's a very carefully crafted character, from the crack of her staff, to her flowing robes to her soft voice. The chatter and squabbles between the good fairies is pretty interesting too, as is the discussions between the two kings. Fine characters all round, though I do feel a bit bad calling Malificent \\"fine\\"... <br /> <br />Worth a look for fans of fantasy and lovers of animation.
B000E1155E|5.0|This Cd was stuck in my player for a long time.  The Artic Monkeys, as you should be aware through song samples and YouTube, play fast rock.  You've got one distorted guitar, and one clean guitar.  The music is catchy, and yet deceptively simple.  The singer paints a great picture of what it's like to be a teenager in a British city.  This is Joe Jackson's \\"Look Sharp\\" updated, a classic disc.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Let me first say this....I am not a music fanatic, I don't dive into how this sound was done or who should be involved in the making or who should'nt..I'm not a reviewer..I just sit back and listen. <br />When I first heard of LOVE, it was when Cirque du Soleil's new show opened in Los Vegas. The one or two songs that I heard on that tv interview, had a different sound to it..it was interesting. So I bought LOVE, got into my car with the Bose System (yes my first Bose cd sys) and started driving and listening.  <br />The opening song, or was it a tid bit...anyway I thought my cd was defective..THEN it took off....deep drums and away I went back to the 60's and the BEATLES refueled.  <br />Yes the songs are not the original,yet they are, there are mixes of voices and drums, crowd noises..listen, just buy it and enjoy a different Beatle yet the same. GET Back to where you belong.
B000002TQV|5.0|This album represents to me what was the best rock music could offer during the 90's. On this cd, Radiohead combined grunge-like riffs, soaring melodies, and mind-bending lyrics that still sound as cutting-edge as the day the album was released 12 years ago. Hard to believe, isn't it? Boy, am I starting to feel old...anyway, if you only know Radiohead from their recent stuff, you need to go back and listen to this cd. OK Computer and Kid A are surely classics, but this one might just be their best...ever.
B000JRYNXE|1.0|This is another Gwen Stefani album that I had to somewhat sit through. She has never impressed me over the years. Her vocals are bad as well as the production. When she was in the group No Doubt, she was awesome, but she mailed in her career last year with that \\"Love, Angel, Music, Baby\\" album. A lot of these songs are completely pointless, and make absolutely no sense. One of my friends burned this album for me, incase anyone is wondering how I obtained it. Do yourself a favor and save yourself an hour and some change, or like me nineteen minutes skimming through the tracks and end up throwing the CD out your window while driving. If you really want this album, it will be in the bargin bin at your local record store for $6.99 somewhere in late Januaury. Oh how the great have fallen. Avoid if possible. 0 stars.
B00004W510|5.0|My dad got me into The Band many years ago when I was a kid, and though  many groups have come and gone in my cd collection since then, I have never got tired of this legendary group. Robbie Robertson and the boys were not only great musicians, they were also some of the best songwriters ever. \\"King Harvest\\" and \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\" are more than just songs, they are incredible stories inspired by American history. \\"Unfaithful Servant\\", perhaps Rick Danko's finest vocal performance, is very moving as well. This is timeless music that set the standard high for all rock music that has come afterwards.

B0000630YA|5.0|Step right up, folks, and join Alice and \\"Steven\\" on their journey through Cooper's wondrous musical nightmare of spiders (\\"The Black Widow\\") and voices outside the door (\\"Years Ago/Steven\\") and waking up in the basement (\\"The Awakening\\"), dead ladies popping out of the fridge (\\"Cold Ethyl\\") and finally, \\"Escape.\\"  This is pure Alice Cooper - a witch's brew of rock and vaudeville (\\"Some Folks\\") that pleases the palate and takes us back to the glorious 70's hey day of Alice Cooper.  This, Cooper first solo release after the breakup of the Alice Cooper Group, also features the hit \\"Only Women Bleed,\\" Alice's first in a line of Top 40 ballads.  This is the Cooper effort that, in my opinion, showcases Alice Coooper's overlooked virtuosity as a songwriter, with horns and strings contrasted with wailing guitars and snarling Cooperesque vocals.  Take the trip - Welcome to YOUR Nightmare.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|This is another Gwen Stefani album that I had to somewhat sit through. She has never impressed me over the years. Her vocals are bad as well as the production. When she was in the group No Doubt, she was awesome, but she mailed in her career last year with that \\"Love, Angel, Music, Baby\\" album. A lot of these songs are completely pointless, and make absolutely no sense. And some of her vocals are almost painful to listen to. One of my friends burned this album for me, incase anyone is wondering how I obtained it. Do yourself a favor and save yourself an hour and some change, or like me nineteen minutes skimming through the tracks and end up throwing the CD out your window while driving. If you really want this album, it will be in the bargin bin at your local record store for $6.99 somewhere in late Januaury. Oh how the great have fallen. Avoid if all possible. 0 stars.
B000ICM5W6|5.0|HighDefDigest gives this movie a perfect 5 star rating for its picture quality in high definition for HD DVD. I'm not gonna comment on the movie itself just how the PQ releates to HD this one is a must have for your collection
0385484518|4.0|I am really not much of a fiction reader but this was a good book... It keeps your attention and has a lot to teach you. You will end of doing a lot of self reflection.
B000060MWU|5.0|This to me is Lynch's darkest work. It goes headlong into the psyche of a mentally ill murderer, and with few exceptions thats where you stay. Just when you think you're coming up for a bit of air another black wave crashes down on you and pulls you back under. <br /> <br /> The pacing doesnt feel good, things feel either labored or abrupt. But thats probably Lynch trying for an effect. The symbolism doesnt feel as concrete or focused in this film as in his other works, but again we're seeing things through the eyes of a madman.  <br /> <br /> There also seems to be no sign of redemption or resolution, the lead character is doomed without the possibility of escape. Its hard to feel particularily bad for him either, he is a murderer afterall.  <br /> Therefore the only emotion you can expect to feel in this film is fear and loathing so to speak. Though I do have to say in the first 30 minutes the fear and paranoia literally leap off the film. <br /> <br /> Interesting film that pokes and prods you in ways you dont understand while watching it. Though it certainly isnt easy to watch. If most modern film bombards us with empty sneering positivism this film is the exact opposite. It lifts up the rocks in the dark places of mans psyche and holds it unwaveringly in our faces. <br /> <br /> Even though this film is hard to watch and understand, you get the feeling like its bad tasting medicine. That seeing this extremely dark film is somehow cathartic. At the very least the film is a strange trip with no handrails to hold onto and no ground beneath you. This film seems to say to me, life is important take it seriously because it can go to places you dont want to go. Look at Fred he's in hell, dont be like Fred.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|It's been a long time since I have enjoyed music this much. This was recommended to me because I mentioned to someone that I like Secret Garden (another Celtic music group). Although the music is quite different, I think liking the one made the transition easy.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I am not a big fan of women singers. I have always appreciated men's voices more. However, these women are just hypnotic with their singing. Four beautiful voices that just ring pure and strong. I really love good vocal music, and finding voices/music this pure is not easy!<br /><br />Besides the pure voices, the song selection is fun. There are some traditional Celtic songs, along with some more modern songs. Some songs are already familiar from other singers/groups, and that just makes it fun when you hear it from these special voices. The songs you are not familiar with you feel you are because the tunes are so pleasant and catchy.<br /><br />One of the knocks is that \\"it all sounds the same--you hear one and you've heard them all.\\" Honestly, I don't want anything else! I enjoy the style so much, that if all the songs sound very similar I am fine with that. Besides, I think that every group out there can have the same thing said--it just depends on what style you happen to like.<br /><br />I look forward to the new album in January with eagerness! Meanwhile, this CD might be worn out by then. It's hard to wear out a CD, but it might just be possible with this!
B000JJS8TM|1.0|Before I start, a disclaimer...I am a *HUGE* Beatles fan. I mean, I own all the albums, know every word and every intricacy, learned to sing and play guitar to the Beatles, worshipped them from the time I first heard them when I was 10, know everything there is to know about their history and the minutiae, not to mention the music. I live, breath, and LOVE (no pun intended) Beatles. But when I heard about this album a while back, I was skeptical, and after hearing it now that it's out, I know I was right. This is rubbish. <br /> <br />I knew I'd hate this as soon as I heard a snippet on a TV ad that had a melding of Drive My Car, The Word, and What You're Doing.What a gimmick. \\"Re-worked\\" Beatles tunes...no they're not. This is a mash-up of Beatles lyrics and tunes from different songs put together to create \\"something new\\" (another bad Beatles pun, I know!). Why did we need this? And not only that, the fact that so many die-hard Beatlemaniacs are embracing this so much disturbs and surprises me...are they all stupid? Or just blinded by their affection for this band? I hold the Beatles in the highest esteem...they soundtrack my life and have for years and years. But c'mon, why mess around with perfection? What next, people going back and \\"re-working\\" the ceiling of the Cistine Chapel because they discovered some of Michaelangelo's sketchbooks, so now it's ok to go doodle over his original art? Ridiculous. <br /> <br />I know I'll get blasted for feeling this way, but this Love album/project is just dumb. And it reeks of greed. The ads on TV say \\"the newest relases from the Beatles\\"...ummm, no. This is just their classic music being messed around with in a studio to come up with something \\"new\\". And I'm skeptical of George Martin's actual input, as it's been known for YEARS he has serious hearing loss. Lennon and Harrison must be spinning in their grave over this ghastly travesty of a release. <br /> <br />Instead of recycled dreck like this, how about giving us Beatles fan some good quality live recordings or TV performances on CD? And leaving the perfect, pure, timeless, magical music of the Beatles alone? <br /> <br />And when people on here (and there have been MANY) say it's \\"like hearing the Beatles all over again for the first time\\"...are you serious?  Is hearing my band's cover version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" like hearing Zeppelin for the first time?  Come on....
B00003CX9E|1.0|This movie is very over rated and if produced today, it would seem rather humdrum.  I believe that this movie is as famous and/or popular as it is because of how the film was made, rather than content itself.  Allow me to explain, Orson Welles had a heck of a time bringing his vision to the screen.  He faced production problems and funding issues and other thorns in the side.  Once he was able to finish the film and the end product was like nothing done before, it was and is placed on a pedestal.  However as far as the film itself, it is so boring and insipid.  I can care less about a politician who is searching for his inner child and the demons of his past.<br /><br />This movie was made several years before World War II; FDR was the president at the time and was rather very popular with the masses.  Does this mean that society back in the 1940s really cared about the ups and downs of a politician?  Consequently, many people could careless about FDR and perhaps politics in general.  Perhaps this explains all the hang ups that Orson Welles ran into during production of \\"Citizen Kane\\".  Take this notion of empathy ten steps forward, the majority of society in American today don't care about politicians.  Oh I think society cares about politics and the incumbents that drive the machine.  However, I don't believe that society cares about the demons and/or inner child of politicians that emanate behaviors and vetoes.  Society today is a bit more self-centered than that.  Just present this notion \\"Rosebud or relief on taxes\\".<br /><br />I'd like to backtrack to the production grapples that Orson Welles faced when he was making Citizen Kane.  Just because he had a hard time making this movie doesn't mean that the film is great.  So Orson had some troubles making this movie, big deal.  Productions woes don't constitute a great movie.  If this were the case Ed Wood's \\"Glen or Glenda (1953)\\" would be a cinematic masterpiece.  Ed Wood had faced many of the same cumbersome issues during the production of \\"Glen or Glenda\\" that Orson Welles faced making \\"Citizen Kane\\".  Nevertheless, \\"Glen or Glenda\\" isn't remembered for its astute aesthesis, it is remembered as a campy B movie.  Which in some ways is sad, the content of \\"Glen or Glenda\\" touched gender identity disorder and transvestite issues.  At this point in time, during the 1950s, this subject was very taboo.  However, Ed Wood had the courage to pull it off.  In comparison of pushing the envelope, \\"Glen or Glenda\\" is more memorable than \\"Citizen Kane\\".<br /><br />I believe there is a cluster of movies people love because they are instructed so by \\"film buffs\\".  \\"Citizen Kane\\" as well as \\"2001: Space Odyssey\\" (which was also a hideous and over rated movie) fall underneath these requirements.  Yet if someone states that they dislike either the former or latter, they are crucified by \\"film buffs\\".  Also people who proclaim they are \\"experts in film history\\" know that any type of slander against \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"2001: Space Odyssey\\" is heresy.  I know a great deal of film history and did plenty of film/video work both professionally and in college.  Despite my \\"declared\\" endeavors, I still think that \\"Citizen Kane\\" sucks, so I guess I'm not a cookie cutter.  Whenever someone states they are an \\"expert in film history\\" it is just euphuism for \\"my opinion is better than yours and you don't know any better.\\"<br /><br />\\"Citizen Kane\\" is a slow moving film, with flat characters, especially the main character.  I couldn't careless about anything that happened in the movie.  I totally hated \\"Citizen Kane\\" and think this film takes too much attention away from other classic films.  With respect to these \\"so called classics\\" (i.e. \\"Citizen Kane\\"), it really does seem that many people assimilate the views of others, rather than using their own critical thinking skills to develop an opinion.<br /><br />Here is a list of some classics that are far superior to \\"Citizen Kane\\"<br /><br />1) Gone With the Wind<br />2) Psycho<br />3) Breakfast at Tiffany's<br />4) The Seven Year Itch<br />5) Scaramouche<br />6) Casablanca<br />7) Suddenly Last Summer<br />8) North by Northwest<br />9) D.O.A (1950)<br />And last but not least<br />  10) Glen or Glendas   4) The Seven Year Itch  5) Scaramouche   6) Casablanca    7) Suddenly Last Summer  8) North by Northwest  9) D.O.A (1950)  And last but not least        10) Glen or Glenda

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Personally, I can take or leave most of the first disc of this Pink Floyd concert DVD. The performance on disc two of the entire \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" album makes this DVD worth the asking price. It is an improvement on the original classic album and even better than when I witnessed the original four members of Pink Floyd perform it on the \\"Darkside\\" tour in 1973. To call this performance stellar would be an understatement. All the backup musicians along with Gilmour, Wright and Mason create an amazing lushness that deepens the dynamics of the original. Two drummers, two guitarists, two keyboards, three female vocalists, extended instrumentals and new rythymic grooves working their way into the familiar songs from this great, yet overplayed album. It becomes new and refreshing. \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" is a mood album that should be listened to in its entirety; not individual cuts mixed in with the other garbage on commercial radio - not even individual songs mixed in with Pink Floyd's other hits as I witnessed on the \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" Tour. This \\"Dark Side\\" performance on Pulse is something to behold. I've watched it five times. I've always believed that \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" was Pink Floyd's greatest accomplishment. There are three ways to enjoy it; the original album, the 5.1 surround-sound remaster of the original album and the ultimate experience of watching Pink Floyd and company on this DVD with 5.1 surround-sound.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|There are times when you should buy the newer version over the old. And there are times when someone might be milking a lucrative cash cow dry and then putting the original versions out. You know who I'm talking about.   <br /> <br />Anyhow, the original Criterion copy was just the film and from what I remember, very little for extras except the subtitles and the commentary, which is also here. I think it was their second release. It now has a roundtable discussion by film experts. The second disc has a documentary on Kurosawa that some may have seen elsewhere. The third disc has a 2 hour documentary on Kurosawa that's about 2 hours long, and a one hour doc on \\"Seven Samurai\\" that's about an hour long.  <br /> <br />That's without getting into the film itself. It's a great film but you need to put a few hours aside for it.  <br /> <br />It definitely looks and sounds a lot cleaner, the quality is definitely a major improvement that renders the original copy obsolete, you'll notice that it's a lot brighter than the older copy and you can see more detail than you could in the older copy.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|This movie was an unexpected delight, and I say this as someone not even remotely familiar with the book. Eckhart's work is suburb as his character manages to be both a caricature and a very real person. This is a portrait of the last days of Big Tobacco's arrogance before the states came in and nearly broke them. Nailer's speech to his son's class was absolutely hilarious as was the send up of the talk show used for the introduction. This is a truly equal opportunity spoof because it casts aspersions on practically everything and everybody including politics, the press, big business, and even child custody arrangements. Nothing is sacred here which is just how it should be.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Las carreras solistas de los integrantes de Pink Floyd han sido irregulares, con excepcion de Syd Barrett. Por ejemplo, Roger Waters lanza un debil \\"Radio Kaos\\" y años despues, el impresionante \\"Amused to death\\". Pero en cuanto a David Gilmour, no ha sido brillante como solista, pero si comprueba su espotaneidad con \\"On an island\\", tercer disco solista despues de \\"About face\\" de 1984, tal vez su mejor registro.    El disco es bastante suave y relajado, con baladas como \\"On an island\\", \\"The blue\\", \\"Smile\\", \\"A pocketful of stones\\" y \\"Where we start\\", pasando al tambien suave blues de \\"This heaven\\" (una parte del solo de guitarra se recuerda a \\"Shine on...\\"), los temas instrumentales como el algo exagerado \\"Castellorizon\\", el experimento del saxo de Gilmour en \\"Red sky at night\\" y el notable \\"Then I close my eyes\\", que recuerda mucho a Pink Floyd en la etapa de \\"More\\" a \\"Atom heart mother\\". Y también hay rock, que es \\"Take a breath\\", un suave pero potente tema (el mejor junto a \\"The blue\\").    Los musicos que acompañan en el disco son notables como Rick Wright, Guy Pratt, Crosby and Nash, Andy Newmark, Phil Manzanera, etc; los solos tambien son interesantes, y una solida producción de Chris Thomas.    Quizas los problemas de este disco, sean la simpleza de las letras (a cargo de su esposa Polly Samson y a veces Gilmour) y tambien creo que Gilmour a pesar de que ha pasado mucho tiempo sin escuchar composiciones tanto solista como Pink Floyd, se haya quedado pegado con su estilo.    Al final, este disco es muy elegante en cuanto a la musica, sin ser genial, pero nos demuestra cada vez mas su indiscutible talento.
B000GGOCIE|5.0|I first read this book when I was 12 years old. I am 31 now, and have never found anything that could quite capture my attention like this book. It is a must read for anyone who likes to escape, and the other books in this series truly make this my favorite set of books. It is an incredible tale of strong women, and as such, should be read by as many women as possible.
0553573403|5.0|I have read many Science Fiction and Fantasy series prior to this one, including LOTR, Sword of Truth, Shanarra, Wheel of Time, Thomas Covenant, Dune, Foundation, etc. They all have their merits (and some demerits obviously) so I would never try to rate them relative to each other. I can also say that (for me) it seems the enjoyment I get out of a series is somewhat dependant on when I read it. At some points in my life I am 'more ready' for a particular plot or character than I am at others.<br /><br />In any case, the Song of Fire and Ice series of books is exceptional in so many ways. I find the characters interesting and multi-dimensional, the plot twisting in intersting and fulfilling ways, and the POV writing to be a great way to keep the scope of the story large while and get across emotions... not just events. I also particularly enjoy the fact that the writer is not afraid to kill off a main character at any point in the story. Just as would happen if this story were true. Its nice to know that the charcters are truly mortal, unlike some of the stories I mention above.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading, not just fantasy. Again, its simply one of the best set of books I have read.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Forget the one star review. This is five star music. <br /> <br />This is folk/blues/country/pop/rock'nroll music only Bob Dylan could create. <br /> <br />It is wonderful. <br /> <br />I have just finished listening to the Album and I can't get the musical wheels it left turning out of my head. It really rolls along. Full of streetwise realism, down to earth straight-taking, pathos, hope, and finally a joy in the music itself. <br /> <br />As a fan of Bob Dylan's earlier masterpieces from the sixties I find nothing to complain about in this Album. I find a mellower tone overall and a deeper, richer and more jagged voice, but I find no loss of melody, lyrical colour or rhythmic intensity. <br /> <br />This is one of my favourites among the many cd's I have purchased this year.  <br /> <br />Compared to his current peers this man is a giant. A Genius? I think so.
B000J10EQU|2.0|I'm in a minority here, but in my opinion \\"Superman Returns\\" was a disappointment. The producers should have asked the TV \\"Smallville\\"  writing & acting team to do the movie.<br /><br />While the special effects in \\"Superman Returns\\" are stunning, the plot is cartoonish and manipulative. It is manipulative in the coy manner (\\"does he or does he not have super-powers?\\") the movie sets up the son of Lois Lane to be Superboy, thereby preparing us for a sequel. It is cartoonish because to have us think that NO ONE sees that Clark Kent is Superman is simply absurd. (1) They look exactly alike, except for Clark's glasses; (2) Both Clark & Superman had been gone for 5 years; (3) Whenever Clark disappears, Superman appears. Come on!!! And to think that Lois, who is so smart she won the Pulitzer, can't see this? What a joke.<br /><br />In having Lois winning a Pulitzer, the movie commits an all too common \\"sin\\" in contemporary Hollywood movie-making. She looks at most 25 years old, but she has already won a Pulitzer prize!!! In today's movies, women not only are beautiful and accomplished, they are also \\"enfant terrible\\" geniuses. In so doing, not only is Hollywood divorced from the real world, it is also setting an impossibly high bar for REAL women. Lois also is entirely without personality and charm, which leaves me wondering just exactly why Superman remains smitten with her.<br /><br />I was especially disappointed by Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. His performance was one-dimensional, shallow, and cartoonish--in the mold of old movie villains who cackle with glee at doing evil. Most unconvincing and tiresome. I can't believe this is the same actor who once won an Oscar for acting.<br /><br />Finally, while Brandon Routh did a respectable job as Kent/Superman, I wonder why both he and the director saw fit to have him mimic Christopher Reeve's rendition of Superman. The far superior \\"Smallville\\" series had demonstrated that there is room for a fresh interpretation, instead of a replicant.nstead of a replicant.
0736063684|5.0|This is by far one of the best books out there for viewing exactly how each muscle will be worked during a vast variety of different weight training excercises. I use it often as I rearrange my work-outs. Avoid the women's book as it barely includes any upper body. Just use this one for both men and women.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Finally I had a chance to see this great movie on DVD.  It is not only a story  about transexual who wants to be a real woman by undergoing operation -- but a story of love and acceptance between two people( Felicity Huffman and Kevin Zegers). Their journey of knowing each other started when they cross-country and faced the unexpected events of their lives. The brilliant perfomance of Felicity Huffman as a transexual woman add greatness to this movie plus the young actor Kevin Zegers who perfomed well as the lost son.
B00064WSN2|5.0|Pay no attention to the bad reviews, this is a great album. This album is often overlooked in favour of the band's first. However, I find this just as good in it's own way. The band's lineup was already beginning to change by this point in time. However, Greg Lake and Mike Giles due turn up for most of this album. Ian McDonald even plays on this album. The album also introduces Gordon Haskell, Mel Collins, Keith Tippet and a couple of others who would turn up on the band's next album Lizard. This really does show the performers who are here at the top of their game. I love the Peace themes, Pictures Of A City is the perfect fusion of jazz and rock. Cadence and Cascade is a beautiful ballad rendered soft. In The Wake Of Poseidon is another great song  with wonderful mellotron and great drumming. Cat Food is a funny song with a cool hook. The Devil's Triangle shows the band at it's most out there and yet very interesting. This new edition also includes the single version of Cat Food with it's B side Groon.
0060776757|5.0|This is a remarkable book written by U2. It's nice to see so many photos and stuff that hasn't been shared before. They talk about their lives in a witty and fun way and you feel like you're there! They have always seemed like such nice guys. A must for every fan! This is what all great artists should do - write a nice coffe table book. Truly appreciated!!
B00065MDSG|5.0|This is the band reformed after a year's breakup with a new lineup except for Robert Fripp. Joining the band for this classic are ex-Yes Bill Bruford on drums, ex-Family John Wetton on bass and vocals with David Cross on violin, viola, and mellotron and Jamie Muir on all kinds of percussion. This is the band's best album since Lizard. Both Larks, Tongues(parts 1 & 2) are unlike anything I'd heard before or since, Book Of Saturday is a nice laid back jazzy tune. Exiles is a very pretty ballad that had been an instrumental back in the band's early days. Here it has lyrics written by new lyricist David Palmer-James. Easy Money which is a great rocker. A must have for anyone who even likes music.
B000066JLO|5.0|These Analogue Productions hybrid SACD's have incredible CD layers,and they are the best sounding CD's in my large collection. I wish Doug Sax remastered everything that I've ever purchased - jazz, blues, or rock. If you happen to like CCR, listen to what Analogue Productions did with their catalog. They were remastered by Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray, who also happen to be ace mastering guru's.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This is one of the best debut albums any band or performer has ever released. There's not a bad song among the collection. From the rocking and relevant 21st Century Schizoid Man to mellow songs like I Talk To The Wind and Moonchild. The mournful Epitaph and the commanding The Court Of The Crimson King. This is such a moving album which bring up so many moods. While groups like Yes paint pictures of places with music this music takes you there. This album is something that belongs in EVERYONE'S collection. This IS a must have. The sound has never been better thanks to the new remaster from the original tapes.
0792839749|4.0|\\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" has the unique position in my life as being the first movie I saw in the cinema. When I was 3 or 4 or whenever I saw it, I believed I loved it. My vague memories are wonderful. Now, watching again at age 40, in 2006, it does not carry over well.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />It was probably no help to watch the much superior \\"Mary Poppins\\" just before. Dick Van Dyke is a great character actor, with a range of skills that make him the perfect clown actor. However, unlike in \\"Mary Poppins,\\" he was not given the right materials.<br /><br />His female co-lead is weak - Sally Ann Howes is no Julie Andrews. The children actors could not have been more bland. The plot was hard to follow, even as an adult.<br /><br />There is one catchy song played too often, based on the onomonopoeticism of the sound the car made while rumbling down the road. Had there been more up tempo songs, or wittier lyrics, I think the movie would have twice the staying power. The other songs sound too close to lullabies.<br /><br />So why it is so popular, and why do I still give it four stars? I'm sentimental perhaps, Dick Van Dyke is so good at doing that Dick Van Dyke thing, or I still find the idea of a car that can fly, float, and look retro-cool fascinating. James Bond would have loved the car, and, why not? Ian Fleming, Bond's creator, wrote the book upon which the movie is based.<br /><br />The premise is that a well-meaning, hardworking inventor played by Van Dyke, single parents two pretty good kids who help push him forward in life. The kids, by force of accident, introduce him to candy heiress Truly Scrumptious. Although they start off awkwardly, the two quickly treat the children to a fantasy of a kingdom without children, flying buildings, international espionage, and romance.<br /><br />For me, the difficulty was that the plot flowed in and out of fantasy. Knowing which was which was hard, and when the ending finally comes around, it seemed as if the worlds became one. I felt confused.<br /><br />Did I like the movie? Yes. If I were shopping for a sweet children's movie, and I wanted something with more classic values, I would consider \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\\" It would not be the first DVD I picked up, but it would be a far better choice than the latest toy-based Saturday morning cartoon series.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comf I were shopping for a sweet children's movie, and I wanted something with more classic values, I would consider \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\\" It would not be the first DVD I picked up, but it would be a far better choice than the latest toy-based Saturday morning cartoon series.

B0000DEO90|5.0|\\"Which musician had number one songs under the most different names?\\" Kasey Kasom asked on his top 40 program once in the late '70's.  The answer was Paul McCartney, who had number one songs under the headings \\"The Beatles\\", \\"Paul McCartney\\", \\"Paul and Linda McCartney\\", \\"Paul McCartney and Wings\\", and \\"Wings\\".<br /><br />This project is one of the longest live albums, being a triple album set in the dark ages (i.e. before CD's, when vinyl was still in style).  To me, it almost seems more like a collection of live performances more than a single concert (there is no introduction at the beginning, nor any obvious encores like there are on, for example, Neil Diamond's \\"Hot August Night\\").<br /><br />This project also is not just a collection of greatest hits.  It does have several hit songs, both from the Beatle days (\\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", and \\"Yesterday\\") and from Wings (\\"Jet\\", \\"Listen To What The Man Said\\", \\"My Love\\", \\"Let Them In\\", \\"Silly Love Songs\\", and \\"Band On The Run\\"), as well as \\"Live And Let Die.\\"  There are also several good songs that were not hits, again both from the Beatles era (\\"I've Just Seen A Face\\", \\"Blackbird\\") and from the Wings era.<br /><br />The concert is heavy on the \\"Band On The Run\\" and \\"Venus And Mars\\" projects.  There is a segment from the then-most current project, \\"Wings At The Speed Of Sound\\", which was originally side 5 of the album and is currently tracks 6-9 of the second disk.  Not performed in the concert are \\"Another Day\\", \\"Too Many People\\" and \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" (and you might argue for \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Get Back\\"), the only things keeping this from being a perfect review of Paul McCartney's career at that point.  But it does include my two favorite Paul post-Beatle songs, \\"Listen To What The Man Said\\" and \\"Beware My Love\\".<br /><br />This project has a lot of energy, that makes these recordings more exciting and lively than the originals in many cases (e.g. \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\", \\"Beware My Love\\", and \\"Letting Go\\").  The opening medley of \\"Venus and Mars\\", \\"Rock Show\\", and \\"Jet\\" is excellent.<br /><br />This project is a welcome addition to any collection, both due to the songs on the project and their quality.eware My Love\\", and \\"Letting Go\\").

B00011F5DK|5.0|I have to disagree with Amazon's recommended ages for this game - my husband and I play this game with or without our child and it's one of our favorites!  Sometimes the two of us play each using 2 sets of pieces for a greater challenge!
B000F4LPJ6|2.0|I actually read the book before I saw this movie and I must say that I was terribly dissapointed.<br /><br />I loved the book because of the social commentary (defining and striving for individualism in a conforming, constrictive society) and politcal statements about a society trying to thrive under an opressive government.  It was a story that could be applied any government in any country.  It's definitely a book you learn from.  It examines the essence of the human condition.  The movie deleted that entire theme.  It instead made up it's own theme which basically boils down to \\"adults vs. children.\\"  In the movie, the adults were actually out to destroy kids (they actually said this).  This movie took away any poignancy that a story about middle school kids forced to kill each other could have.<br /><br />Now, moving away from thematic differences, there are also huge plot differences as well.  It seems like almost everything was changed.  From huge details such as pretty much the entire ending of the movie (there is a huge random scene at the end that sums up the movie and wasn't present in the book) and adding a strange relationship with Kitano (Sakamochi in the book) and Noriko (or maybe just a very, very strange obsession).  Pretty much all the students were given different weapons and many die in very different ways.  They are given less time to complete the game as well.  In the book they have 3 days and in the movie they have a day (if I remember correctly).<br /><br />There also isn't as much character development, but that's to be expected when you make a movie out of a book with over 600 pages and 40+ characters, so I can't fault it for that, but in general when that happens, a story becomes more about the action and plot than an overall message.  This movie fall victim to that.<br /><br />The movie isn't all bad, however.  It is extremely entertaining and it will definitely be a conversation starter for friends.  It's a good movie to watch with all the lights off and a giant bowl of popcorn with a handfull of friends late at night.  There won't be any dissapointments (unless they've read the book already lol).<br /><br />Oh, and I can't speak to the special features on this version because I have a korean box set (so random, I know) that comes with BR1 and BR2 (and don't even get me started on that one.  It's even worse) and a 3rd, special features, disc that I can't watch because it's in Japanese and has only Korean subtitles, two languages I cannot speak at all.<br /><br />So overall, if you've read the book you probably won't like this movie much  at all, but if not, you'll most likely love it.  It's action packed with a pretty good message (albeit a very different one from the book).<br /><br />I definitely suggest reading the book over watching the movie or, if you want to do both, watch the movie first.l of popcorn with a handfull of friends late at night.

B000JBXXZ4|3.0|I havent even heard this album to be honest, however, while reading the reviews of others i have seen many mistakes. If i read one more review where people say incubus only has 3 albums other than this, i will scream. incubus has 6 full cds now total fungus amongus (the best issue to date if you havenet heard it all i need to say is psycho psilocybin), science, make yourself, morning view, crow, and the new one. i have the first 5 incubus cds and there is a trend. each cd is easier to listen to with less originality to it. fungus amongus is like no other cd ive ever heard every song is different. incubus has gone from a respectable rock band to just another pop/rock band. they dont experiment anymore and the songs all sound very similiar at least to me. they have some other cds as well even though they are more like ep's. Enjoy Incubus came out after fungus amongus and is an add on to that cd while good i wouldnt recommend it to the casual fan, but their ep When Incubus Attacks vol. 1 is my favorite thing they have ever put out. it has some acoustic songs, live songs, and a previously unreleased song. there were only 225,000 copies made, but if you happen to come across it i highly recommend. anyway hope this was helpful
B00005JPAJ|5.0|'Babel' is a great film because it uses a broad canvas to make a sweeping statement about the entirety of human experience. The filmmaker is saying that our all-to-real failures to communicate with one another -- failures that occur even when we share common language, culture, and experience -- foster a sense of disconnection that ultimately is false, because in fact we are deeply and profoundly connected, today more so than ever. This remains indestructibly and inexorably true even when we try to ignore it, deny it, or subvert it. <br /> <br />Even if there were nothing else to recommend the film, the director's command of a multi-lingual, multi-cultural cast itself represents a stunning achievement, one deserving of recognition. <br /> <br />'Babel' is not a feel-good movie. It is one of the most emotionally powerful films you will ever see.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I absolutely loved this film.  I am not personally into extreme S&M but just loved the measures this movie took to make these people real.  JAmes Spader plays a perfestionist who has control issuse and Maggie Gyllenhaul is a mousie character who cuts to release her stress.<br /><br />Spader's character takes the stress out of Gyllenhaul's character by basically controlling her reactions, allowing her to be free of stress.  Whenever she makes a mistake, he \\"punishes\\" her rather than allows her to hurt herself...she's safe in his hands.  You see her begin to explore her true woman self by actually taking care of her appearance.<br /><br />Spader's character begins to feel guilty of the boss and employee relationship and tries to release Gyllenhaul from her duties, but she has other plans...She knows he loves her and will prove it.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This CD shows incredible growth and versatility for one of the most talented musicians in the world today and has my highest recommendation. <br /> <br />Josh showcases his smooth-as-silk baritone in songs that range from the more classical sounds of \\"Un Giorno Per Noi\\" from Romeo and Juliet to the electronica sounds of \\"Now or Never\\" to the more funk sounds of \\"Machine\\" and African influences in \\"Weeping\\".  My personal favorite is \\"L'Ultima Notte\\" which translates to \\"The Final Night\\", a song about the end of a relationship which contains such raw emotion that it makes me want to cry everytime I hear it.  His collaborations work well and his own songwriting is showcasing more of himself, the inner man we are getting to know better through his music. <br /> <br />Every single track on this CD is a keeper.  There are NONE that I want to skip over after listening to it many times.  No two songs sound alike - the range of different styles is mind-boggling.  There is certain to be something for everyone here. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD or its companion, the Special Edition, which contains 2 additional songs and a DVD on the making of the album. <br /> <br />With the talent and willingness to explore displayed on \\"Awake\\", I cannot wait to see the next steps that Josh takes in his incredible career!
B00005JNX0|2.0|This movie had such potential! Technically speaking, the plot is clever & the characters unique, but the dialogue is stilted & doesn't flow smoothly. There are a few laughs involved, & occasional clever phrases, but as a result of the poor craftsmanship, it's a mediocre movie--just like the preview foretold.
B000HT3P7E|3.0|I LOVE this show.  I was overjoyed to see season 1 out so fast.  But I am appalled that it is being sold IN FULL SCREEN MODE ONLY.  This show is shot and broadcast in HD.  Sure, selling in DVD (and not HD-DVD nor Blu-Ray) makes economic sense for now.  But selling it solely in full screen mode is just unfathomable.  What were they thinking?  PLEASE OFFER THE WIDESCREEN SOON!  YOUR FANS ARE WAITING!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I have enough traditional Christmas CDs - by December 13 I am skipping tracks to avoid yet another boring version of the expected songs. <br /> <br />\\"The First Noel\\" alone is reason enough to buy this CD. It is an amazing mix of tribal and Gaelic and Sarah's clear voice, all swirled together and weaving a fresh Christmas tapestry. Even the more \\"traditional\\" are made fresh by her approach.
B000J103PC|5.0|Just loved this movie!  This was the movie to watch this summer, the acting from all the stars was just top notch.  Meryl Streep was divine as the \\"boss from hell\\", Emily Blunt was so perfect for her role, Anne Hathaway, was wonderfully cast as the \\"I don't like fashion, but want to be a journalist\\" and finally, Stanley Tucci was so over the top, but also very wise and just the nicest gay man you could ever want to work with. This movie proved that good writing, great acting and a very appealing cast does not need a 120 million dollar budjet to be entertaining and memorable.  Grab this while you can!

B00005AREQ|5.0|This is Jeff Beck's best album.  A masterpiece of guitar work.  This is an all instrumental album that features what Jeff does best - play guitar.  The supporting band is excellent especially the drum work.  Production quality is excellent as well.  While I wouldn't consider JB a blues guitarist I would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this album show cases why.  A great companion album to Blow by Blow is Wired.  It's a shame that after Wired his record company made him go back to albums with vocals.  He has on a roll and at a level that he has rarely gotten back to. If you like guitar and can live without vocals buy this album. You will not be disappointed.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|This album is, in words lifted from it, a party that ain't over `til it's through. I have no idea how I have avoided a wreck while dancing and singing in my car. If \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\" isn't the song of 2006, I don't know what could be; it protests against toe-tapping but is guaranteed to incite full-body motion. \\"Paul McCartney\\" is a riot, \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\" a very pretty but up-tempo falling-in-love song, and closer \\"Everybody Wants the Same Thing,\\" while quite vague, is sure to be played in heavy rotation at gay marriage rallies. A rough patch in the middle precludes calling this the best album of 2006, but nothing closes the deal more effectively.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|On this, his third proper solo album but fifth studio release, John Mayer grows up. No longer pondering his quarter-life crisis, Mayer is thinking bigger. The opener, \\"Waiting on the World to Change,\\" laments his (and my) generation's difficulty in making an impact on the political and social culture, while later songs lament difficult relationships, the pain of living with a broken heart, and, in the album's most universal song, \\"Stop This Train,\\" the ache he feels each time he pulls out of his parents' driveway knowing they won't be around forever. With his excellent John Mayer Trio album last year, Mayer proved he has chops. This album shows he's got staying power.
0618680004|5.0|My big question has always been, \\"Why don't all children give up their belief in God when they give up Santa Claus?\\"  I did and it's hard for me to grasp how it could go any other way.  God and Santa are such peas in a pod.  They see you when you can't see them, and they know if you are good or bad, reward or punish you accordingly, and they do miracles.  That seems like a slam-dunk to me, but apparently it isn't.  Instead of teaching children to be skeptical of other supernatural entities, the Santa fraud seems more often to function as a training god.  Dawkins doesn't mention Santa Claus or answer my big question directly, but he suggests some possible explanations in Chapter 5, \\"The Roots of Religion.\\"   To me, Chapter 5 is worth the price of the book.  The rest is a nice bonus.

B000002OX5|5.0|The Who Sell Out (1967) proved that The Who was not just another quick singles band for whom an LP was too large of a canvas. The Who Sings My Generation showed promise, but its follow-up A Quick One was undercooked. Sell Out was when they finally produced a complete set of all original songs that was uniformly strong from beginning to end. The sound on this record was much less mod, and an lot more pop and psychedelia. Fortunately, they were careful to not sound too much like freaks or hippies (cause after all, they were neither). Instead, Townshend was determined to embrace the sound of the late 60s without simply blending into it. And while their ambition was obvious, the fake commercials that connect the songs - including two longer ones written by John Entwistle - indicated that the band was unwilling to itself too seriously.<br /><br />For as much of a quintessential Who album as Sell Out is, it opens with a song written by John \\"Speedy\\" King, a friend of the band and later a member of Thunderclap Newman. \\"Armenia City in the Sky\\" is about as psychedelic as The Who ever got, lyrically and musically. \\"I Can See For Miles\\", the band's only US Top 10, is another slice of psychedelia, with its crashing drums, insistent guitar, and far off images of the Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal. \\"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand\\", meanwhile, is an inviting acoustic singalong in the vein of The Grateful Dead's folkier moments (think \\"Uncle John's Band\\").  The Who also reinforced its powerful pop deminsion on the gorgeous tunes \\"Our Love Was\\" and \\"I Can't Reach You\\". Finally, there is Entwistle's lone full-length contribution, \\"Silas Stingy\\", which anticipated The Small Faces' 1968 classic Ogden's Nut Gone Flake.<br /><br />And honestly, the great stuff doesn't end there. \\"Tattoo\\" is a poignant, even bittersweet song that uses its title subject to symbolize an act of youthful rebellion of which the narrator will be forever reminded. Daltrey is in particularly fine form here. Indicating that Townshend was in a forward-thinking mode, the acoustic arpeggios on \\"Sunrise\\" and the electric riffs on \\"Rael 1\\" foreshadow Tommy.  The only slip on the CD is \\"Odorono\\", which is a bit silly and may have worked better in shorter form as one of the commercials.<br /><br />At the point in their young career at which they needed to make a great record, The Who went above and beyond the call of duty with The Who Sell Out. The songs themselves were more solid than ever before, and the band milked the LP format for all that it was worth. Unfortunately, \\"I Can See For Miles\\" is the only track that has endured to the point of being known to non-Who fans, but at least a half-dozen other songs are among The Who's best. Fans and critics will continue to bicker over whether Sell Out or Who's Next is their best album. Even if Who's Next remains the greatest by the standard of general consensus, The Who Sell Out will always be their most entertaining.wnshend was in a forward-thinking mode, the acoustic arpeggios on \\"Sunrise\\" and the electric riffs on \\"Rael 1\\" foreshadow Tommy.

B00005JPDJ|5.0|This is the best romantic comedy I have seen this year. It has all the great elements of a truly amazing \\"chick\\" flick. Humor, romance, solid likable characters, foreign locations, etc. make it so great. Cameron Diaz is at her bubbly best, Kate Winslet is so charming, Jude Law is terrific, and my fave Jack Black shows his range at being utterly charming and adorable. This is such a simple film compared to the effect block busters like Eragon, etc. that it made more of an impact with me, because of the character development and solid storyline. Go Out, Watch this film and ENJOY!

0679746048|3.0|This book was written in a simple manner, easy for anyone to read without having to go over it and re-analyze. It describes some of the author's experiences and feelings as well as the things that actually go on in mental hospitals.  <br /> <br />It also brings up some rhetorical-type questions. She was in the mental hospital during the Vietnam war and she was wondering if the world outside was crazier than the hospital. I think this was the best and most memorable part of the book.  <br /> <br />Her main question, however, was whether she belonged there. Valid question. She was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which has characteristics such as suicide attempts, mood swings and promiscuity. She kind of asks what is the actual number of sexual partners that defines promiscuous? This is a valid question, even though diagnosing mental illness is hard to make into an exact science. I believe she questioned whether she actually had BPD, and this was question that I was also wondering. I think a lot of it may have just been part of her adolescence more than anything.  <br /> <br />She had the right to question whether she had BPD, but she made the mistake of taking it a step further and questioning whether BPD is a mental illness. She lost me when she started comparing BPD to homosexuality- homosexuality  is no longer considered a mental illness and she hopes that someday BPD won't be either. Is she crazy?! After knowing someone with BPD and seeing the suicide attempts, OCD, mood swings, eating disorders, drug abuse, stalking, narcissism, codependence, and backstabbing that goes along with it, I know that BPD is a serious mental illness and it's almost like every mental illness rolled into one. This makes me think that she didn't have BPD and she has never met anyone with it. Toward the end of the book, when she is in the present and reflecting on her experience, she comes off as kind of arrogant, not just in denying that BPD is an illness, but in other ways also that she describes her life. She starts to get on my nerves.  <br /> <br />This book may be good as a beginning look at mental hospitals, and it may also be good for younger people, but the book that really interested me and gave a better description both of the mental illness and the life in the hospital was I Never Promised You A Rose Garden.
B000H305U0|5.0|Justin, really out did himself with this new album. I love it! my favorite jams are the first song:future, sex, love and #10-love is all I have and #11-a song about drug use!
B000H30B2C|4.0|When people hear the name \\"King Kong\\" they instantly think of a giant monkey that climbed the empire state building with a screaming blonde in his oversized (and opposible thumbed) hand, but when I think of King Kong the first thing I think of (as cheesy as it may sound) is love.<br /><br />  King Kong is (above and beyond all the action and CGI) a love story.<br />The movie begins with aspiring actress Ann Darrow (played by the ethereal and spot-on Naomi Watts) being offered a part in a major motion picture being filmed by Carl Denham (played by Jack Black-who I think was a little bit miscast in this role). Ann takes the offer reluctantly and boards the dirty, cargo ship along with the a whole crew of misled sailors, and Adrien Brody's character Jack Driscoll (who is the writer of the movie being filmed).<br /><br />The crew of the ship and the actors and film makers are soon voyaging across the sea, aimlessly searching for Skull Island, a mythical place that Carl is set on finding. When they DO find the island, the locals aren't so keen on them and bloodshed occurs shortly after. The primitive, dentally challenged tribe puts there sights on Ann and soon after she is kidnapped, tied up, and stolen away in the night by Kong.<br /><br />  I don't really want to give too much away by going into a long, boring summary of what happens in the film, but instead will just point out the highs and lows of the movie.<br /><br />  Peter Jackson (The Lord Of The Rings) has created another epic cinematic acheivement with Kong. The film is action packed. There is literally a 12 minute or so fight scene between Kong and a trio of nasty dinosaurs, a creepy battle between men and giant bugs, a dino-chase scene that blows Jurassic Park out of the water, and an ape running amuck in New York City.<br /><br />  But, underneath all of the action, adventure and CGI effects, the best part of this film is the relationship between Ann and Kong.<br />  Naomi Watts does an excellent job building her friendship and love for Kong. She  geniously plays Ann with a mixture of whimsy, grace and innocence. Her belief in destiny and fate lead her emotions throughout the film, and that is truly a beautiful thing to see.<br /><br />  Another interesing part of the movie was the budding romance between Jack and Ann. Adrien Brody plays the brainy-screen and theater writer with a very authentic 1940's feel. His odd, strange looks make him somewhat more relatable than any other mainstream stars would have been, which makes him likeable as Kong's main rival for Ann's affection. Jack and Ann share an obvious romance almost from the start, which adds a love-triangle element to the film<br /><br />Eventually, Ann finds that Kong, despite his monstrous stature and fearsome, chest pounding roars, is a big softy who only wants to protect and care for her.<br /> What would you do if you had been snatched up by a giant gorilla, after the fear and horror fade and you realize that the \\"beast\\" loves and cares for you? As a viewer, we are exposed to one woman's reaction to this. Ann fears Kong, but her feelings change after he constantly rescues her. You feel her blossoming love for him pour into your heart as she tries to explain the meaning of \\"Beautiful\\" as he gazes thoughtfully at a magnificant sunset.<br /><br />  The two characters soon share a bond so strong that it can only be defeated by death.Most people know the way the story ends, and it IS tragic. Ann and Kong's love story will bring some viewers to there knees sobbing. You will smile as the Beauty and her beast share a heartfelt moment sliding on the ice in central park. You will gasp as Kong is pelted with bullets but still manages to protect his beloved Ann...and as she tries to return the favor for once, climbing the building and flinging herself in front of him, trying to stop the pilots from killing her beloved ape. And in those final moments when Kong looks lovingly at her with those sad, knowing eyes, you willsurely cry...If you don't-you are probably dead inside! This movie is one of the saddest I have seen in a lonnnnnnng time. The dramatic and haunting score also adds some points to the overall quality of the film. James Newton Howard does a great job, especially at the more profound moments in the movie. The music playing as Kong slips away from the building to his fate as Ann hysterically cries, is one of the saddest scores I have heard in a while, and the song BEAUTIFUL is what it's named after. I would have given the movie 5 stars if they had knocked out some of the action/CGI and focused a lot more on the love story.ably dead inside!

0743289412|2.0|Stephen King lost me a while ago when his novels started to become re-hashes or his previous novels but i was bequiled into buying this book by a review which stated that Lisey's Story was King's foray into literary fiction. My problem with King has always been that I like his plots but hate his cutesy \\"smucking\\" style of writing. King attempts to tamp down the cutsiness in Lisey's Story (with deadening effect) but alas it rises up like brush fire most notably in his unneccesary use of gimmick-y fonts. I also found Lisey to be a repellent heroine along the lines of the wife (whose name escapes me) in The Shining. King seems to do better with male figures such as the ones in \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" (genesis for the movie, Shawshank Redemption), The Green Mile, and the story (also from the collection, The Four Seasons, maybe his best book) that became the movie, Stand by Me. I just finished James Lee Burke's book, Bitterroots. Now that guy can write, but his plot was shaky. I'd love to see Burke and King collaborate on something...
B000J4QWMC|3.0|I am big fan of the tv series, that being said, this movie is really nothing like the series at all.

At least the show had some good controversial and jaw dropping endings, wish I could say that about this movie.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Marillion has been a major part of my listening base for the past twenty years, starting with the angst-filled, gritty vocals and harsh, intense sounds of their early days with former lead \\"Fish\\".  I was a hard convert back in '89 when H took his place.  But in the intervening years, this proved to be their greatest move since creation.  Each album built on previous success artistically, from Rothery's unique and passionate guitars, Pete's innovative and melodic bass, Mark's complex and scintillating keys, and of course, Ian's artfully coordinated percussion.  At the center of that is H; with his soulful and approachable voice and the intensely personal and poetic lyrics.  Marillion had far surpassed early success with such iconic masterpieces as Brave and This Strange Engine.  They poked dark fun at American pop culture with Afraid of Sunlight (well any celebrity really, not merely American or British)...but in Marbles...well...they really went for broke.  This is a TRUE progressive rock masterpiece, but beyond that it's also a musical one of any genre.  The two-disc special edition is a kind of emotional journey through the realities of middle age; it plays on our feelings of regret, or loss, of hope, of false and true redemption...of insanity and clarity.  I haven't been moved to tears by an album since Brave...and this one rips me apart every time.  From Invisible Man to Neverland, this album unabashedly pulls out our demons and paints them in vivid and stark color. <br /> <br />If you buy only one album this year, or any year, I recommend that it be the 2-disc set of Marbles by Marillion. <br />
B000002MZ6|5.0|Mike Oldfield's music is so eclectic and therefore very unpredictable.  The man is a genius, but honestly, he has produced some albums I can't stand.  The Songs of Distant Earth, however, is awesome.  It's one of those albums you can listen to for days on end.  It reminds me a great deal of a cross between Enigma and Vangelis with his signature guitar style entwined throughout.  It is mixed with very quiet surreal moments to more upbeat with chants and operatic vocals, making this one of those rare albums where you actually enjoy ALL of the tracks.  This is definitely worth owning.  I just discovered this and will be adding it to our radio broadcast.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|I got my new CD of Taylor Swift at the Mall of America on Sunday November 26th I saw her at the Miami/Detroit game for the national anthem on Thursday November 23rd I got my brand new autograph of 2006 2 years ago I started with She Daisy and Laura Branigan and I have her new CD with the autograph with my name on it I collect them all for my collection I have my She Daisy,Lee Ann Womack,Martina McBride and Taylor Swift CD of 2006 I'm getting a Carrie Underwood and Kellie Pickler CD for my collection.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I love this CD, don't get me wrong; I like Celine Dion, even the pop albums that she has been accused of \\"selling out\\" with.<br /><br /> But this CD is by far her best in a while! It shows her voice as what it really is, amazing, with out needing any synthesized sounds. I enjoy the songs with Jean-Jacques Goldman the most; a great singer/song writer with a wonderful voice on showcase!<br /><br /> Even if you don't understand French you will enjoy the feeling and power put into this CD. I would recommend this album to any Celine lover, and for anyone who's not...give this one a try, you might find she does have \\"the pipes\\" after all : )
B000002H97|4.0|First off Metallica is one of my two favorite bands of all time (the second being Radiohead).  <br /> <br />James is a lyrical genius. His vocals are always intimidating at best, and his themes - while consistently dark - are almost always mature and  at times tastefully poetic.  <br /> <br />Kirk is an excellent guitarist, and has proven to always be full of surprises.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately this album, while absolutely incredible...is not really metal in my eyes. I see it as the first step Metallica took into the realm of hard rock. While there are definitely metal elements in this album, overall, it just doesn't seem have the same level of furious, maniacal angst as previous outings.  While there are indeed some jems, they don't really compare to previous Metallica songs. Time has shown Black to be - stylistically - Metallica's true crossover album. It can be argued that virtually all material put out by this band since 1991 has met with at best, a luke warm reception.  <br /> <br />Which really is a shame; I probably would have enjoyed this album more if all its predecessors didn't either attempt to replicate it or somehow follow in its large footprints. I have no problem - as some fans do - with a band departing from a style. Typically, I really enjoy band experimentation; I find it refreshing as it adds a new material to the vault as well as expanding musical range. Alone, this album (in my opinion) can be seen as somewhat of an stylistic departure from past albums...WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY BAD. However, after Black, Metallica's musical direction seemed to get bogged down and clouded by its massive commercial (i.e. radio friendly) success. Additionally, (and this is a personal grudge) its a travesty that virtually the only Metallica songs that get regular air play are almost solely off this album.  <br /> <br />This album - chronologically - was the last Metallica album I purchased until St. Anger was released (which was done purely on impulse before previewing any of the songs on the album...a mistake).   <br /> <br />However, I would argue that this album is excellent for new Metallica fans. The songs are probably more accessible and familiar to those not accustomed to Metallica's previous albums and sound.  <br /> <br />An over all ranking of the best Metallica albums (by me) would probably place this album at somewhat of a distant third or fourth (St. Anger being last).  <br /> <br />HOWEVER, when coming at this album from a more mainstream approach...it could be argued that the Black album is probably the best hard rock/metal album since 1991. Plus you can't really be seen as a connoisseur of modern rock music without this album in your collection.          <br />
0609610570|4.0|An excellent book that focuses on a business principle that is often overlooked. Both authors do a great job of explaining the steps involved in creating an execution culture. They also provide ample examples from their experience to create an indepth understanding of the topic.<br /><br />Overall a good book that everybody should read, even non-CEO types.
B00005RYKU|2.0|The Glass House (Daniel Sackheim, 2001)<br /><br />There's a scene about two thirds of the way through The Glass House that pretty much sums up every way in which this movie went wrong. It's hard to set the scene without spoilers, but I'll attempt to do it anyway: a character has died. We know from various things, mostly a makeup job that would look appropriate in a microbudget horror film rather than a big Hollywood release, that said character has been dead for some time. Said character is found by another character. And, you know, just as character B finds character A-- who was previously quite banged around postmortem-- something character A was clutching in his/her hand is released and falls to the floor.<br /><br />Little stupid things like that can ruin a whole movie for me, because they tell me that the director is willing to go for the cheap shot rather than trying to keep some semblance of reality in the film. That's exactly what happens here (you see the ending coming a while before the characters do, to be sure), and it's a shame, because it turns what might have been a fun, serviceable little thriller into a waste of some incredible talent.<br /><br />Ruby (Joan of Arc's Leelee Sobieski) and Rhett (The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio's Trevor Morgan) have recently been orphaned. The estate's executor, Begleiter (the mighty Bruce Dern) has decided to allow the petition of family friends Terry (Insomnia's Stellan Skarsgard) and Erin (Unfaithful's Diane Lane) Glass to take the kids in, over the objections of their Uncle Jack (Law and Order's Chris Noth). All seems to be going well, but Ruby gets a weird vibe from Terry on a pretty regular basis, and begins to think that there might be some ulterior motive to the Glass' offer to take them in.<br /><br />This is a great cast. A great cast. Skarsgard and Lane have been among the highlights of the acting world for a lot of years between them, and Sobieski is a fast-rising star (or would be, if she'd keep her participation in such dogs as Eyes Wide Shut to a minimum). And, of course, there's Bruce Dern, whose very name inspires some film critics to cower in their respective corners, gibbering. So how did Sackheim, a very capable TV director who's worked on some of the best series on television (House, The X-Files, Millennium, Law and Order, et al.), and screenwriter Wesley Strick (True Believer, the 1991 adaptation of Cape Fear, et al.) manage to bungle this as badly as they did?<br /><br />I tend to lay the blame on Sackheim. Tricks like the hand thing in the first paragraph of this review play a lot better on the small screen than they do on the large screen; that's the sort of controlled cheesiness that made The X-Files so much fun to watch over the years. But then you look at Strick's fantastic track record before this movie, and you look afterwards and see Doom . What went wrong?<br /><br />Whichever way you look at it, though, there's wasted talent to go around here. There is some fantastic set design; one wishes as much attention to detail had been paid to letting some fine actors do their thing in front of it. **p her participation in such dogs as Eyes Wide Shut to a minimum).

B00000DCHI|1.0|The first time I witnessed Billy Joel was on Saturday Night Live in 1978 performing \\"Just the Way You Are.\\" And being it was the first time I saw the show and Billy Joel, it caught me by surprise when I found out his performance was not one of the skits. A group of us were trying to predict the punchline during the song and we all agreed halfway through that the camera was going to pan out and B.J. would be wearing no pants as the lyrics seemed to be a sardonic ode to self pleasure. To our surprise, the song ended and they cut to commercial. We still thought we were being put-on, but after watching the rest of the show and seeing B.J. perform \\"Only the Good Die Young,\\" we realized this was truly the day the music died. As B.J., the disco era and new wave would give way to 30 years of complacency in popular music, with the occasional breath of fresh air like The Clash or The Talking Heads mixed in to keep us living in reality grounded, music would never again see the rush that produced the likes of Hendrix, Zappa, The Band, the Exile-era Stones, the Stooges and all the other bands that embody the true spirit of rock and roll just 10 years earlier. Do people actually get inspired or feel the passion by listening to \\"Uptown Girl?\\" If you ask me, Tom Petty got it right when he sand about an \\"American Girl.\\" Or do his fans not feel the downer vibe every time \\"Piano Man\\" gets played at a bar? That song is second only in  the instant depression category to \\"Desperado\\" in my opinion. And to this day I always wonder every time I hear \\"My Life,\\" and listen to the lyrics, I wonder how B.J. now applies what he wrote than to his current episodes, such as the numerous occasions he crashed his car into trees, houses, and fire-hydrants with the only reasonable explanation for his behavior that comes to mind was our prediction that Mr. Joel was wearing no pants at the end of the SNL skit. Just about every musician in the history of rock has had substance abuse problems, and B.J. seems to be one of the only ones that couldn't handle the rock and roll load and got himself into these embarrassingly townie-bar-esque escapades. Skip the B.J. experience and rock just as hard as this music by buying a pair of tight stonewash Bugle Boys instead...
B000002KIE|5.0|Aprreciation of this album comes from appreciation of the day and age when the album was written. <br />The word PUNK is being mirepresented here, because of main stream media. Anyone who is younger than 35 should seriously have no input on this album, because it is not relly to do with the music. PUNK ROCK is what all the Green Day fans listen to - NOT PUNK..... During the mid Seventies in England, life was bleak, the Pistols said \\"get off your arse and do it for yourself\\" and F to the establishment. This is what the music on this album is about. And to say Steve jones cannot play the guitar, try playing the songs and then tell me that.  <br />Society today is going the way it was in 1970's and music is crap, so lets see if Green Day can be real PUNK's and change society as the Pistols did. Thought not....
B000I0QK74|3.0|I was really excited about this CD as I love christmas music and have a large collection of holiday music. However as one reviewer put it \\"it's distinctly James Taylor\\". The sound is in no way traditional and his voice to my suprise just does not exude anything christmas. I was very disappointed.
0316381357|1.0|If I may borrow M.R. James' title, there is \\"A Warning to the Curious.\\"  It's necessary to read this novel with caution.  Many of the quasi-military practices described in sister formation, daily life, and Sister Luke's exit from religious life appear to be unknown to most religious orders.  Furthermore, Ms. Habets and Ms. Hulme apparently became life partners; that's pleasant for them, but does affect the views presented.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is a magnificent film. Clint's best wild west flick since his work with Leone. It's such a different sort of film though. It is much more moral, in the same vein as High Noon. Gene Hackman's performance is also phenomenal and really makes the film, especially in the final confrontation. I'm kinda a sucker for special editions, but this special edition is certainly worth it. The 2nd disc is loaded with interesting featurettes which is just what I expect and want from special editions. I hate it when I  get nothing but typed up bios of cast. This one has got the bios too, for completeness's sake I'm sure. :)
0375714669|5.0|My bestfriend gave me Persepolis as a birthday gift and told me that it was one of her favorite college required readings. Once I started reading the first one I couldn't but it down and was sad when I was done. Thankfully there was another to follow. As with the first, as soon as I started to read this book I couldn't put it down. This book is like nothing I have ever read befor. Not only did I get to read about anothers life but I learned a great deal about other countries, cultures and their struggles. This book, the first one, and Embroideries also by Satrapi are wonderful.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I love westerns, and I love none more than the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. This version is also the easiest to love. The remastered soundtrack and improved digital transfer make it a joy to watch in a modern living room. The added scenes are all worthwhile additions. There is even a bittersweet inclusion of an extended version of Tuco's beating on disc two that couldn't be restored to the same quality as the rest of the film. This is arguably Leone's masterpiece, and Eastwood's best western, at least until Unforgiven. If I had to search for one thing to complain about, it couldn't be the movie but the packaging. The box is a tad hard to open and could use a little thumb slot in the side to make it easier. If you have ever enjoyed any wild west movie you will no doubt love this one as well.
