B0002VL0KQ|5.0|THESE SONGS SAY THE THINGS WE OFTEN FORGET TO REMEMBER TO SAY TO THOSE WE LOVE...THEY REMIND US OF WHAT A GIFT OUR CHILDREN ARE AND CELEBRATE THAT LOVE.  I DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MY OWN MOTHER, SO I ONLY RELATED TO THE FEELINGS I HAVE HAD AND STILL HAVE FOR MY TWO GROWN CHILDREN. <br />I NEVER WANT TO FORGET. <br />

B00005M989|3.0|Prince is arguably the most talented and greatest musical artist of the 20th and 21st century. We see this with the albums 1999, Controversy, Dirty Mind, and the Early album titled \\"Prince\\". In addition to his great work in the 80's we see the albums \\"Come\\", \\"Emmancipation\\", \\"New Power Soul\\", and \\"The (Symbol) album\\". He has put out so much great material. It is utterly pheonomial. So, to begin with, no matter how many \\"Best of Prince\\" CD's you have, there will always be one or two songs that \\"should have gotten on.\\" But I'm here to tell you, this CD, lacks two if not three songs on it. First off, it lacks Controversy, which is one of Prince's best. Secondly, it lacks Dirty Mind, and you could easily make an argument that the song \\"Head\\" should have made the list. But because it is only on 1 CD, there is always going to be one song or two that gets snubbed. So, to avoid any disapointments, get Hits 1 and Hits 2. These CD's cover it all. They have 36 of Prince's best songs, and nobody is going to gripe or complain about any songs getting snubbed. They are all there. Plain and Simple. If you buy Hits 1 and Hits 2, you wil be satistfied. Guranteed. So forget this CD, it's incomplete. Hits 1 and Hits 2, they have all of the best songs of Prince from 79 -91.
B000002GFC|5.0|Great basic compilation for begginers into Cream music such as myself , I have to admit that Clapton work never were that appealing for me untill i get lately into stoner rock since many new bands into this genre have rescued old influences and even very well known musicians that years ago fronted extreme metal styles have embraced stoner rock (i have commented before this in past reviews), well, Cream is one of the cornerstones of stoner rock many of the basic ingredients for this style were contained for the first time in Cream sound and for this reason im a beginner in to this legendary power trio music and what a surprise!!!!!, refinement of heavy riffs , methodic drumming , bluesy bass and fine vocals , nicely modulated not overproduced and natural vocalization , sublime slow riffs sinchronized in harmony with percussions and bass create delicious climax moments, \\"white room\\" is a classic now i realize from were The Cult took some elements for their  style, \\"Im so glad\\" is so bluesy, Politician is a heavy song before the age of heavy came it is all a discovering , 3 music legends in one of the most real rock and roll bands Cream. <br />HM
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|I was forced to hear Celine perform a song from this album on the Oprah show, and after that I knew it for sure: she succeeded in taking her 'music' to an even higher level of sappiness, blandness and false sentiment. Her music really makes me want to run to the toilet to vomit and take a hot shower after that just to rinse off the dirty aftertaste of her voice. The worst thing about it is is that this music pretends to come right out of the heart, while teaming up with that equally sappy baby photographer is clearly an attempt to earn an extra couple of millions to buy a 57th luxurious villa in Northern-Uruguay or something.
B00005Y2EL|5.0|Thin Lizzy \\"Renegade\\" 1981 release is a Cd that I really really like !! An impressive mix of musical expression, depth and soul. <br />\\"Yes\\" it is different from most Thin Lizzy. But, \\"Who Cares\\" It's whats inside that counts. The spirit and soul of the music we hear brings emotion, and Renegade is overflowing. <br />Lead vocalist and bassist Phil Lynott has one of the most identifiable Rock n Roll voices. His voice ranges from tough to sensitive and everything in between. To play the bass guitar and sing at the same time takes real talent and Phil excells at it. <br />Phil Lynott is also a Great story teller as expressed in his songwriting. <br />My other favorite on this album is Drummer Brian Downey. He is no slouch. You know your in for a treat whenever he lends his talents to a recording. <br />Renegade features solid guitar performances, talented drumming and formadable songwriting which are exclusive to Lynott's talents as a story teller. This Renegade Journey makes for a very enjoyable listening experience. <br /> <br />Featured songs are: <br />\\"Angel Of Death\\"- Song about a devastating nuclear holocaust. <br />Very intense driving stacatto bass patterns combined with steady forceful drumming. The ending also features some explosive drum fills. <br /> <br />\\"Renegade\\"- Rythmic guitar chords and drum accents really enhance this song. Solid bass and drums. Creative off beat drum patterns during the middle section of the song. <br /> <br />\\"The Pressure Will Build\\"- A straight forward Lizzy Rock n Roller. Trademark dual harmony guitars. <br />  <br />\\"Leave The Town\\"- Uptempo fast rocker with a southern rock feel. <br />Guitars are the main focus of this fast Rock n Roll Shuffle. Dual lead guitars are showcased !! <br /> <br />\\"Hollywood\\"- A story about the Hollywood lifestyle with its dog eat dog mentality. When your down on your luck. This song has a catchy chorus that will have you singing along. A guitar solo as well. <br /> <br />\\"No One Told Him\\"- A songabout relationship issues. Another Lizzy style straight ahead Rocker.And another catchy sing along  chorus. Also features some very cool drum triplet patterns throughout. <br /> <br />\\"Fats\\"- This is really different for Thin Lizzy. A Funky Jazzy syncopated bass and drum song. Interesting chord structures with an expressive piano solo. Solid blues rock lead vocals from Phil. Standout guitar and piano !! <br /> <br />\\"Mexican Blood\\"- Lynott's story telling at its finest. A latin rock feel with the emphasis on rock. Features creative percussive timbales and even some marimba style mariachi playing. <br />Excellent percussion and drums. <br /> <br />\\"It's Getting Dangerous\\"- A Lynott story teller again and its a good one. Lots of drum fills and bass guitar going on. Fine rythym guitar work. <br /> <br />Some interesting trivia surrounding Thin Lizzy: <br />1. Band spokesperson Scott Gorham nicknamed the band, The most unproffessional proffessional band in the industry. Because they were always late for there gigs. <br />2. Thin Lizzy didn't start their first tour of the US until 1975. They were backing up Bob Seger and Bachman Turner Overdrive. <br />3. Drummer Brian Downey and Phil Lynott were school mates and remained close, both proffessionally and personally for many years. <br /> <br />Listen and Ye Shall Hear !! <br />There Is A Little Renegade In All Of Us !! <br />
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres when it was first released, and again on DVD. Ryan and Rachel do an amazing job, and Nicholas Sparks makes you fall in love with the book all over again. Absolutely amazing!
B0006284JQ|1.0|In musical history, there have been many innovators. Karlheinz Stockhausen, The Beatles, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Autechre and Kraftwerk have all made stuff that was misunderstood the first time, but globally acknowledged after a couple of years for their importance. They pale, however, in comparison to Britney. She is an innovator beyond belief. She started toying with avant-garde structures on her first album, but after that, her creative mind just went on the loose. Free-form clickhouse mixed with the tougher parts of Olivier Messiaens \\"Turangalila Symphony\\" is a way to describe it, but by saying that I actually insult Britney's genius mind. This album with all of her singles is one of the most complex and prodigal pieces of work I have ever heard. Even after the billionth time of getting her hits violently pushed down my throat by MTV and mainstream radio, I still can't get my head around it: it's simply too out there. Britney; maybe I will never fully understand the depth and complexity of your art. But please know that you're right up there with Shakespeare, Einstein and Da Vinci. Thanks.
B00005JNJ7|3.0|Team America: World Police is as stupid as it promises to be. In the interest of full disclosure, I generally enjoy the cable TV series South Park, but Matt Stone and Trey Parker seem to miss the mark with their movies. <br /> <br />The problem with Team America, I think, is a simple one. When Parker and Stone do movies, they aren't limited by the stricter mores of television. While their stuff usually has some good seeds, they rarely develop into anything in their films as it's much easier to issue a string of curse words. If that were to happen once or twice in the movie, it could be funny. When it happens every five minutes, it gets old. <br /> <br />For all of the flaws though, there are some great moments. The music is full of foul words, but hilarious, and the highlight of the soundtrack has to be Kim Jung Il - - yes, the North Korean dictator - - singing \\"Lonely\\". Since the characters are marionettes, their movements have much of the same funny, fake quality as those in the South Park series. Parker and Stone capitalize on this at crucial moments in the plot, creating automatic comic relief. The creators also use computer animation, sometimes subtly, to make the characters seem more real when they want to. <br /> <br />I'm not trying to be too serious in picking apart the movie as it should be clear that it's not going to be up for Academy Awards. But Parker and Stone have a gift for making an audience laugh and they have a unique perspective on the world. The movie uses the same technique as the South Park series of making enemies of both sides of a debate: The movie opens with the Team obliterating the heart of Paris. So, from the beginning, the movie is a commentary on America's ignorant use of power and insensitivity to other cultures and customs. <br /> <br />At the same time, some liberal ambassadors of Hollywood and New York City aren't spared. The Screen Actors Guild becomes the Film Actors Guild (apparently so the acronym can spell the word FAG,) andis headed up by none other than Alec Baldwin. Most of the celebrity marionettes meet extremely violent ends as they square off against the Team in their quest to rule the world. In one hilarious moment, Michael Moore blows himself up, taking Team headquarters with him, as he becomes a martyr for peace. <br /> <br />This is one to rent, in my opinion, but it's definitely good for some yucks if you at all like the Parker/Stone sense of humor.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Very rarely do you hear music that has this depth and arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Want One\\" is reminiscent of Queen's \\"A Night at the Opera\\". Lush vocal tracks and so many of them that there's a new level of discovery with every listen. \\"I Don't Know What it Is\\" is pure brilliance. A song about soul-searching and hope, this masterpeice is thickly layered with 4 or five guitar parts that change during verse and chorus and continue to build, harmonies in fifths and vocal pads that rival any Broadway arrangement. String pads creep in the b-section, \\"so I knock on the door and I am on the train, going God knows where to\\"... a virtual train ride that takes you to a different emotion with every section..the middle break is truly like the sun breaking through the clouds as it build to a gorgeous crescendo...\\"I was hoping the train was my big number\\" ....re-sampled vocal parts  that are layered so deeply and placed in the oddest places...\\"...dunaway by the crossing\\" metered so strangely, they almost sound like another instrument. Finally Rufus begs \\"...you gotta do it, you gotta be there....\\"  with a warm delay on his voice that is just dreamlike.<br /><br />\\"Go or Go ahead\\" is got to be one of the best songs I've heard in 20 years, by anyone. Period. A sublte and steady build starts with acoustic and voice with the occasional harmonic on the guitar... a backward guitar creeps in, heavenly vocal inflections on single words...then a weird \\"doo doo vocal part\\" sounds like angels on LSD, but if they werent enough, there's even another vocal part under that.  Chunky guitar starts to creep in, then finally the crash begins...steel-eyed vampires of love....Rufus sings his bloody heart out in this song...the line \\"surprise me\\"...is done with about 38 vocal tracks...The middle 8 on this one is mind-blowing.<br /><br />It's almost too much to grasp the first ten times...when you finally understand what he's doing, you just can't believe the work this man and Marius Devries put into this album.<br /><br />\\"Natasha\\"...makes me weep every time I hear it. I'm not afraid to admit that. It just kills.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Child\\",  sounds like it should be named just that... sometimes titles and lyrics don't match, this song makes me feel young & cleansed like I'm visiting a carnival tucked away in a child's closet.<br /><br />Again, Rufus mesmerizes with vocal arrangements. Vocals that emulate a rollercoaster with their sweeping motion followed by horns that sound like your at the circus...you can smell youth,  cotton candy,  but all in a bizarre way. The carefully crafted lyrics are just intense at times. I've found myself sitting with headphones on and weeping with emotion.<br /><br />\\"Dinner at Eight\\",  the final track,  is a story of Rufus' lifelong struggle with his father. His leaving Rufus for the road when he was younger, leaving him in the ...\\"drifting white snow\\". This is a bittersweet tale of a boy's love for his father, no matter how much he was hurt by him. The haunting string section makes you feel the blustery and stirring snow being swept up around you...Rufus' heartfelt delivery tugs at every heartstring, and just when he seems to have some resolve, that his father loves him in his older self, he revisits the first stanza and re-affirms that they may always have some differences.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this album.<br /><br />You'd be out of your mind not buy this. Buy seven copies and give them to friends you really care about, and who know their s---t about music. They will thank you like all of my friends did. And make sure you do not copy this album for anyone. Please buy them and support this great artist.
B000065VA1|5.0|This entire albumn is fantastic -- interesting musically, lyrically and rhythmically.  \\"So\\" is definitely one of my favourites.  Peter Gabriel has branched out most successfully on his own and this brilliant recording proves it.
B0006399FS|1.0|This is just a mindless album. It is a desperate attempt to try to parody earlier recordings. However, after two tracks it starts to blend into one of the worst U2 songs ever - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own - that just does not seem to be going anywhere. Periodically there are shameless attempts at pop commercial singles. I have never been more let down from a band then I was by the so-called \\"U2\\" on this one.  <br /> <br />How could one explain how shallow and meaningless their music became after All That You Can't Leave Behind ? They gave up on art and opted for being ROCK ICONS, a damnable pity if there ever was one. <br /> <br />If I were 80s Bono I would be embarrassed to even be associated with the ( now commercialized ) name U2, who unfairly subjected us to this torture they call a \\"U2\\" record.  <br /> <br />...takes a second to say goodbye say goodbye oh oh oh <br /> <br /> <br />
0446310786|4.0|I never saw the movie with Gregory Peck and knew very little about the plot but I knew the book and movie have been regarded as classics. So I was expecting a great read and I wasn't disappointed. The old south's racial code of ethics, were written with a great deal of insight and I thought it was very interesting comparing it with our current day struggles with race relations. Needless to say we've come a long way, thanks to people's attitudes  like the character Atticus portrayed in this book. A must read.
B000002OX7|5.0|The Galileo spacecraft was launched in 1989, went into orbit around Jupiter in 1996, and then continued into deep space with a \\"time capsule\\" of great works of art. Along with Bach's Toccatta & Fugue in D, Beethoven's 9th, Mozart's 41st, Brahm's 1st, they should have also included \\"Who's Next.\\"<br /><br />Some works of art were simply meant to be: they transcend their time, they are greater than their creators. \\"Who's Next\\" was  accidental and almost never released - an afterthought when LIGHTHOUSE burned to the ground. The Who certainly didn't know what they were unleashing when they released this album in 1971. But \\"Who's Next\\" was the result of musical, political, and cultural forces that converged to forge a perfect work of art and genius. When I listen to this CD I think of \\"Amadeus\\" when Salieri says, \\"Displace one note and there would be diminishment, displace one phrase and the structure would fall.\\"<br /><br />Say what you will about Great bands, Great rock & roll, or even great music, give it a hundred years and the truly immortal works will live on as classics and everyone and everything else will be be forgotten as imitators. 33 years after \\"Who's Next\\" was released, it still ranks at the top here with almost 300 reviewers giving it 5 stars. If you buy this CD and listen to  Pete's unworldly riffs, John's flying bass, Keith's inhuman drumming, and Daltry's vocals as they range from the angelic to the demonic, then I'm sure you, like me, will want to listen to this over and over again until your ears bleed.<br /><br />The Who has always been understood as a really, really, I mean, REALLY loud band. But, I'd like to point out that The Who is also one of the few bands who really understood dynamics and Who's Next proves it.  John Lennon said he wrote Helter Skelter because he heard that the Who had played one of the loudest concerts in recorded history and he wanted to record something that was just as, if not louder than, the Who. But listen to this CD and you'll see that the Who understood dynamics better than Lennon, McCartney, Keith Richards, or anyone since. The music on Who's Next can be barely audible acoustic featherlite finger strumming in one bar to EXPLODING BOOMING SCREAMING BASS and Cymbals the next. OR, in reverse, they accelerate the tempo, ratchet up the volume to 11, and take off with a manic melody line that simply can't get any more crazed until BOOM, the volume plunges down to a three note repeating synthesizer line that floats in the air and lets them and us catch our breath until BOOM! \\"Meet the new boss, Same as the old boss!!!\\"  (\\"Who Are You?\\" is another wonderful demonstration of how well they could execute dynamics).<br /><br />I dare you to listen to \\"Won't get fooled again\\" and compare it to the 4th movement of Beethoven's 9th: Same dynamics, same exploding music, same mark of genius. Beethoven was the first to use a chorus in a symphony because he felt he had stretched the limits of sound and harmonies that he could get from an orchestra. Townsend was the first to use a repeating, randomizing synthesizer track as a metronome supporting live instruments. Both experimenting, both pushing the envelope. Both at the top of their game. Both deaf.<br /><br />I feel exactly the same way when I listen to both the 9th and Who's Next: pure, unadultered, joy, air drums and singing along, letting the music take me where it wants.<br /><br />Townsend, Entwistle, Daltry, and Moon, the whole lot of them, would all probably puke, kick me in the groin, and then throw me out their hotel window for comparing them to Mozart and Beethoven. They can piss on this review all they want, but \\"Who's Next\\" will be listened to long after they're and we're all dead and gone because it's simply the Greatest, most perfect Rock and Roll CD of all time.his CD and you'll see that the Who understood dynamics better than Lennon, McCartney, Keith Richards, or anyone since.

0060594888|3.0|If you want learn how to plan and reach your goals, as well as how to deal with failure or roadblocks, this may be the book for you. Overall, it is extremely inspirational and motivational, and having read it from beginning to end, I do have much more enthusiasm and optimism about goals, success, and life in general. However, I only gave this book three stars because upon closer observation, it is merely a collection of other books' ideas. In every chapter and sub-chapter, Canfield references the books and programs of other authors, including his own, and encourages readers to investigate them further. So in a way, it's a giant collection of advertisements and self-promotion, with the material serving only as a brief overview of those books, programs, authors, etc.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|I love the songs Take Me Out and Auf Asche, but for the most part this album blows, and the hype is completely unjustified. The rest of the tracks sound like something Perry Farrell or the Ghandarvas had a hand in.  If you like that kind of thing, than go for it, but if you like the hits you've heard, than maybe you should avoid wasting your money.
0446677450|3.0|I ignored this book when it came out, but decided to finally see what all the buzz was about. I had seen the author on infomercials, sporting a sly smile, so naturally I had written him off as yet another peddler of half-baked Get-Rich-Quick schemes. However, the book was rather surprising. <br /> <br />This book is comprised of financial principles that the author was taught when he was a child by his friend's successful father - whom he calls his \\"Rich Dad\\" - contrasted with those of his college-educated father, who is the \\"Poor Dad.\\" The ideas are insightful, the analogies many, but it lacks a \\"this is how you do it\\" aspect.  <br /> <br />The author does discuss the ideas to some extent, coloring them with examples and numbers, but if you want to learn how to actually take advantage of the investments and ideas mentioned, you'll have to look elsewhere. Perhaps this is where the infomercial comes in and helps the reader.  <br /> <br />As an aside, there are numerous grammatical and spelling errors. These do not detract from the delivery of the ideas, but I found them to be quite distracting. For a book of such popularity, they should have at least taken the time to proofread and revise those errors for subsequent versions.

Suddenly two college students investigate it to discover that it's a spaceship and it's aliens are evil bloodsucking vampiric clown-like creatures whom's only intention is to eat the human race.<br /><br />Very entertaining and different kind of Science Fiction/Horror Comedy flick that has became a cult favorite over the years, but if you can just overlook the bad acting with dopey dialog, you can enjoy the film for it's special effects, realistic if creepy clown creatures and imaginative ideas for kills & weapons that only the red nosed invaders from another planet can do.<br /><br />The DVD has great picture with great sound, the extras are very nice like a audio commentary by the directors known as the Chiodo Brothers, 5 featurettes, bloopers, 2 deleted scenes with commentary, still gallery, storyboard gallery and Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />If you love Sci-fi, horror and comedy with b-movies then this movie is just right for you.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Lifeforce\\", \\" The Blob ( 1958 and 1988)\\", \\" Predator\\", \\"Predator 2\\", \\"Aliens\\", \\"Alien\\", \\"Alien3\\", \\"Alien Resurrection\\",\\"Alien vs. Predator\\", \\"Critters\\", \\"Critters 2\\", \\" Mars Attacks!\\", \\" IT!

B0000DD7NL|5.0|This is one of the first CDs I ever bought and it is one of the best in my collection. The songs on here are so well crafted and put together that it makes Alicia seem like she has been doing this for over 10 years. She is so different from most of the divas out there who shake their butt, like Beyonce, Ashanti and Ciara, and I have to say, she is probably the best arrival so far in this millennium. Nearly ever song on this album deserves a 5 star, and I hope she keeps coming up with good music in her years to come. The DVD is very interesting because it talks about her journey through life and how she became an artist and who helped her and influenced her along the way. It also shows her on tour and the places she went to and how that had a part in the development of this album. This album was the reason I bought Songs in A Minor, which is also another excellent piece of work, and I know she will win many Grammy Awards this year. I highly recommend this album to all Alicia fans.
0805076476|5.0|It turns out that one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen is also one of the most deliciously bizarre books I have ever read.

If you're looking for something good and different to read - this is definitely it.
B000002LCX|5.0|This is The Smiths \\"best\\" album. <br /> <br />\\"Best\\" is in quotes because \\"Strangeways\\" doesn't exactly represent the classic \\"Smiths\\" sound, yet it is a masterpiece in it's own right.  It would have been the beginning of the second phase of The Smiths career had they continued on. <br /> <br />\\"Strangeways\\" sounds like The Smiths were finally comfortable in their own skin and the songs just rolled out of their collective artistic conciousness without any hint of \\"trying to create something great.\\"  Their earlier efforts seemed to have an agenda in that they were very strident in their effort to make you hear their message. <br /> <br />\\"Strangeways\\" simply \\"is\\" The Smiths through and through, and I don't think they cared one way or another if anyone \\"got it\\" or not. <br /> <br />This album stands alone and I'm certainly glad that I \\"got it.\\"  I recommend that you \\"get it\\" too. <br />
B000002B5L|5.0|In a time where the airwaves are cluttered with faux-gangsters and their wanna-be spinoffs, The Fugees \\"The Score\\" stands as a brilliant piece of work. The rhymes are flawless and real, and the beats are hot and original. Although \\"Killing Me Softly\\" stands out as perhaps the most recognizable track on this album, there is way more under the surface.  <br />Favorite Songs: Zealots, Cowboys, How Many Mics, and Fu-Gee-La
B0006284JQ|5.0|I love what Britney is doing with her career. With each album, she's getting trampier and trampier as she comes to the realization we all knew a long time ago, the girl just can't sing. I have no problem if you can't sing as long as you are aware that your point in the industry is to give guys something to white water wrist to. That is exactly when she has done. The whole thing at the VMAs with Madonna was great, \\"I'm Britney Spears and I'm losing my fanbase so I'm going to kiss Madonna. Did you hear that, I'm going to kiss Madonna! That will shock you!\\" She is wearing less and less, trying to sing less and less and covering songs that weren't even good in the first place. To say she does a horrible cover of \\"My perogative\\" is in insult on so many levels. She manages to be worse than Bobby Brown, wow. I can only hope we start seeing more girl on girl action in the future and I'm guessing we will. I like the direction Britney, keep it up!
1567184855|5.0|LIke his second book, this book has changed my life.  I recommend it whole heartedly.  This is not your typical spiritual book.  It is more than that.  It is a work of art.  It is a labor of life and shows a passion for detail that is exceptional.  I found this book easy to read and wonderful in content.  I read it cover to cover.  I was not bored, nor did I find any dry passages.  His work and research is outstanding.  If you are at all, interested in lives between our life then you need to read this book.  Wonderful does not do it justice.  Outstanding is more like it!
B00005NTJK|5.0|1970's \\"Benefit\\" is Jethro Tull's third album, and this one is truly something special. Ian Anderson & company continue to expand their musical horizons---with \\"Aqualung\\" just around the corner---and deliver an album that combines truly powerful rock with great acoustic numbers. Lots of Tull faves on this one, such as \\"With You There To Help Me,\\" \\"Nothing To Say,\\" \\"Son,\\" \\"To Cry You A Song,\\" \\"Inside,\\" \\"Sossity, You're A Woman,\\" and, what is quite possibly my all-time favorite Tull song ever, the stunningly beautiful \\"For Michael Collins, Jeffrey And Me.\\" This new remastered CD of \\"Benefit\\" sounds incredible, and generously adds four bonus tracks, too, including the Tull classics \\"Witch's Promise\\" and \\"Teacher.\\" Ian Anderson's songwriting is phenomenal, as is his singing and performances on flute and guitar. Martin Barre plays some truly scorching electric guitar thoughout, bassist Glenn Cornick (in his final album with the band) serves up some excellent basslines, drummer Clive Bunker does incredible work on the skins, and making his debut with Tull is keyboardist John Evan, who lends great support on keyboards and piano (though he isn't pictured with the rest of the band on the album cover). \\"Benefit\\" is one of Jethro Tull's most inspired works.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I can't believe all of the reviewers who are calling people who like this film \\"stupid\\" and begging us to not waste our money. First of all, people can RENT the movie and check it out for themselves, it's about $3 at the video store. Secondly, from my experience, I've actually found that the people I know who liked this movie are much more analytical and clever than the people who hated it. The people who hate this movie are quite simple minded and boring-the type that need to see blood, sex, and guns firing for them to be able to enjoy a movie.  The reason why this movie is so popular, is because most of us are sick of that genre of movies. I'm to the point where I pretty much only rent Indie films because Hollywood movies are so completely soul-less and predictable. Check this one out with an open mind, get lost in Napoleon's world, and laugh your $%# off!
B000000W5P|5.0|I think there is no song that personifies Keith quite as much as this. The rest of the album is great, miss you and beasts of burden are obviously classics.<br /><br />But the lyrics and the delivery of \\"wasn't looking to good, but was feeling real well!\\" that keith lays out before the refrain.... Great stuff. The only Keith song that's potentially better is Salt of the Earth.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album really f*cking rocks and you should get it, this band is insane live and they sound amazing on the cd. 100% worth it.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Chicago is a good movie.  I honestly wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  A good surprise.  I am not a fan of Catherine Zetta-Jones, but I will admit she is okay in this movie.  I however think Zellweger steals the show along with Gere and Latifah.   <br /> <br />The plot of the movie is that two ladies are on murderess row and Gere is trying to make them stars from there.  Yet, there is only one room for a legend.  In the end there will be a star, who will it be?  It is a great remake of a musical and I enjoyed the music.  I think the music shinned right along with the movie! <br />
B000001ZS3|4.0|Jean Michel Jarre pulled of an incredible move when he released \\"Oxygene.\\" He made the world of electronic music safe for composers. While a small, select few folk were making music with the earlier synthesizers of the day, most of them either concentrated on making novel reinterpretations of classical (think Tomita or \\"Switched On Bach\\",) cold, mechanical drones (Tangerine Dream) or music that was intentionally robotic (Kraftwerk). While I love just about all of the aforementioned artists, \\"Oxygene\\" was the first album that made me think of synthesizers as instruments as opposed to toys.<br /><br />Jarre did this by making the songs of \\"Oxygene\\" play out like a classical composition. Each movement had distinct and original melodies and each sounded like it could hold its own as a song unto itself. The themes also sounded like they could be as organic and enveloping as the album title suggested; this was earthy music long before the term \\"new age\\" got slapped on everything that was vaguely atmospheric and meditative.<br /><br />NB; Also a reason I still listen to this with a touch of nostalgia; my high school put on a production of \\"Hamlet\\" that used \\"Part II\\" as the processional music for the entrance of King Claudius.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I love songs on this CD and I hate songs on this CD.  It is very different than a lot of the music that has been coming out the closest I can think of to compare them to is the Strokes.  I love the slow soft songs as I think the lyrics and music work well for Jet.  But I know some people like \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" and \\"Are you Going to be my Girl\\" which I liked when I first heard but the songs have been played so much that now I want to throw something at my radio anytime those songs come on and I also skip them in the CD too.  I like the rest of the CD it is just getting over played the radio plays great things into the ground.  If you like any of the songs on the radio then you will like this CD.  Personally, my favorite song on the CD is \\"Look  what you have done\\".
B00062IVKS|5.0|This is just a wonderful set that have made for this landmark movie.  This is one of my favorite movies because it is so brutal in scope and nature, that it is somehow comes out being pretty.   And now, they have released what has to be the defintive version, I do not see them re-releasing this movie again, this is tops!!!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest films ever made.  It is packed with today's hottest stars...Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell.    <br /> <br />Zoolander (Stiller)  is the hot model but this year he is going to get knocked off his pedestal by Hanzel (Wilson) and Mugatu feels this is his chance to take over the model world by using Zoolander to kill models.  It is hilarious and a great laugh anytime you need one.  It is a movie that never gets tiring!  Just remember for those watching this is more of a slapstick comedy a play on words and such not a serious comedy in any way! <br />
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I saw Wicked last night on Broadway.. I went in thinking I am going to be wowed by this show. I am a huge Broadway Theater goer. I've taken ample courses throughout my college education in Theater and was quite disappointed with the production. THe staging and costumes are incredible and the two leads are vocally superior. The show was very boring and minimalistic at times. The message is wonderful but it could have been done in two hours not three. The two leads Galinda and Elephebia made the show come together, however, the ensemble was also lacking. THe words sang were very jibber jabbish and it was difficult to feel you were watching a consuming musical. This is by no means the best musical on Broadway. If you want raw, incredible talent, go see RENT. Musicals should leave you feeling perky, happy, and each song better than the next. Wait til the show goes on Half PRice throught TKTS. It's not worth it. I think you will find just the same when you continue to listen to the soundtrack. It's just not catchy enough. I wish I could sing along to it, but nope..
B00009XITP|5.0|What a Girl Wants is a great movie.  Everyone in the family from young to old will love this movie.  As it shines with comedy and a story of hope and trust.   <br /> <br />Daphne (Bynes) wants to find her father.  She dreams of him at every wedding her mom and her work.

Yet, in the end Lord Dashwood and Daphne will both find out who they are.   <br /> <br />This movie is a fun time.  And a good movie for everyone in the family one you will not be embarrassed by.  You will get absorbed by the characters and will be pulled in by the onscreen chemistry of Firth and Bynes.   <br />
B0002O06N0|5.0|I'm listening to this album for the second time now, it's got great balls of raw distorted electric guitar on the verge of feedback...track 2 now, kickin my head in it's really funky, drums pounding away, too bad Foreigner couldn't make 'Hot Blooded' sound this cool. Very raw, dirty tone. 'Desperate Man' has a Dead 'Viola Lee Blues' riff going along there, but extremely fuzzed in a Nuggets way. This stuff is 1966 interpreted by young musical scholars with great taste who are keeping my rock n roll head above water. I must admit, I'm more for the uptempo songs on this thing, but that's how it goes sometimes - slower ones, i.e., track #7, take longer to appreciate, cause you know, I don't want to slow down. Cool, track 8 is rocking again! Not to knock the White Stripes or Mooney Suzuki, but Rubber Factory is the album I've been waiting for since the garage rock revival started. OK, I gotta go check their tour dates. Great album, Black Keys!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!  I don't know why everyone tends to focus on it being a Rock Opera but I just think of it as another Green Day CD.  And I think it is their best yet!  They have grown up a lot since Dookie and I really didn't care for the last few CDs.  I love this  CD however not one song on this CD is terrible!  I don't skip any songs and each song is lyrically brilliant!  I hope people don't base this CD on past Green Day experiences...I know that Green Day has had its ups and downs but this one is truly an up!  If you review this CD from the point of never hearing Green Day before I think you will love it!  I know a lot of the singles are played to death on the radio...at least they are where I am from...and that makes you not want to own this CD; just remember there are plenty of songs on the CD and those few singles will grown on you once they get off the radio.  The CD is great for not a hard-core punk sound but more of a pop punk sound; even so I love it!
0380729407|4.0|A masterpiece of modern literature, Something Wicked This Way Comes is the memorable story of two boys, James Nightshade and William Halloway, and the evil that grips their small  town with the arrival of a dark carnivalone Autumn midnight. How these two innocents, both age 13, save the souls of the town as well as their own, makes for  reading on timeless themes. What would you do if your secret wishes could be granted by the mysterious ringmaster Mr. Dark? Bradbury excels in revealing the dark side that exists in us all, teaching us ultimately to celebrate the shadows rather than fear them. In many ways, this is a companion piece to his joyful, nostalgia-drenched Dandelion Wine, in which Bradbury presented us with one perfect summer as seen through the eyes of a 12-year-old. In Something Wicked This Way Comes, he deftly explores the fearsome delights of one perfectly terrifying, unforgettable autumn. O
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have never been a Sarah fan, but I absolutely love this CD.  It is brilliant and I find it her best CD yet.  It is full of her heart and her soul.  Every song is sang with out a flaw one.  The music pulls you in.  And both today they work well.  Each song on this CD is wonderful.  The songs are soft and slow and each one will whisk you away and you will be living the a land called Afterglow.  This may be Sarah's way of gaining new fans as I have always thought she was good but never good enough to buy and I actually bought this CD.  I think it is worth trying; I think many will come out pleasantly surprised.
B000002JS6|5.0|Whenever I ditch school, and stay home by myself, about seven out of ten times, I put this on and prance around to the point of utter exhaustion. I'm pretty sure my dad did the same thing in his younger days, but when something's good, it is good, however many generations later. Just makes me a bit sad that hardly any of the newer artist can achieve this level of rockiness... <br /> <br />It's not about the lyrics or the meaning - it's all about the sound. I don't have most words to these songs in my memory, except for lines that stand out or get repeated, but the rhythm, voice, and guitars stay in my head for a long time. That's the point of this kind of music. <br /> <br />I think this album is the best one to start getting into the works of AC/DC. If you haven't been into this band before, provided that you enjoy this sort of music, this'll uplift your mood, and probably make you realize that you can hop on one foot much longer than you though you could. <br /> <br />\\"Back In Black\\", the title track, is my personal favourite on this CD. It all kind of makes me wish I'd been born earlier...
B0002OERI0|5.0|Like some of the reviewers here, I was also in high school when Dookie came out. It quickly became one of my favorite albums to date and will now forever be linked to that period of my life. That album was more fun than anything else. Although it had some social commentaries, they were typical of the times, not controversial or too rebellious in form.    American Idiot is another album that will forever be linked to our current period in time. That's reason alone to get this album. Its undeniable rebellious nature is a sign of our times. Nevermind if you think of yourself as a conservative or a liberal, the point is American Idiot is a reflection of how people have been feeling for years. There are not that many albums out there today so bold and politically charged as this one.    The first song, American Idiot, is a complain about how the media have completely numbed Americans. It is not the best in the album, but it sets the tone and it simply rocks.  My favorite though, is the song Holiday. Anti-war lyrics with great melody combine in one of the best songs I've heard in years.   Boulevard of Broken Dreams has already become a classic. I just hope they don't overkill it with excessive air play.  Give Me Novocaine is destined to become another Green Day classic. The title pretty much says it all.  The medley of Jesus of Suburbia lets Green Day show off the different styles of rock and punk they have learned to master. The entire album is Green Day showing off their musical talents, and aren't we glad they did?    Tha album (rock opera if they must call it that) is amazingly well put together. Each songs just belongs exactly where it is. Green Day is not my all-time favorite band but when I listened to American Idiot the first time, I couldn't wait to play it again right away. I had never done that before.     I recommend this album for the music, for the lyrics, and because it is the album representative of our times.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux's debut, Dreamland (1996), tried to bring together in one recording elements of jazz, blues and old-time country with a contemporary sensibility, but succeeded only in flashes.  The few times everything clicked, as on \\"Getting Some Fun Out of Life,\\" I felt Peyroux might really be onto something, even though the album's overall inconsistencies were frustrating.  About thirty seconds into \\"Dance Me to the End of Love,\\" the first song on Careless Love, I started getting that feeling all over again.  By the time I got to number five, a nightmare-music cover of Elliot Smith's \\"Between the Bars\\" that hangs on a simple, hypnotic bass pattern, I knew this time she'd nailed it.      Comparisons to Billie Holiday be damned, Careless Love is arranged and performed with a subtlety, restraint and intelligence that throws into bold relief the deficiences of poseurs like Cassandra Wilson and Holly Cole, both of whom sing a variety of songs in a jazz-inflected style but embody disingenuousness with every breath.  Listen beyond the superficial similarities to Holiday and you'll hear in Peyroux a singer who is plugged into the essence of what elevates the best of jazz (or any art form):  simple, direct expression, no BS, no reliance on overt \\"technique.\\"  Fluff princess Norah Jones could learn a lot by listening to this disc (as could her fans).    One of the surest indications of Peyroux's command is how she has her lazy way with Bob Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\\" dancing out from under Dylan's formidable shadow on a light, loose rhythm with her laid back reading of the lyrics.  The magic she performs on Leonard Cohen's \\"Dance Me To the End of Love\\" strips away the cheesy synth melodrama of the original and replaces it with a light swinging feel still laced with a melancholy aura worthy of its author.  She even manages to imbue the album's title song, tired standard that it is, with a new warmth.    Producer Larry Klein deserves great praise for establishing the perfect setting for Peyroux's talents, and every musician here demonstrates his excellence without showing off, which is the true sign of a good accompanist.  This is as tight an ensemble as any singer could hope for, deftly balancing modernity with a reverence for the past -- just the backing this performer needs.  Let's just hope she doesn't wait another eight years to record her next album.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This movie was awesome. If you people really liked the matrix series. You will love this. This is how it should have been. Why are people saying it was disappointing. I loved it. I was thrilled when the dvd came out. I saw it in theaters and I loved it. This movie also has awesome opera music at the end. The last fight is really cool to. IT ended how it should. Neo and Smith are both the high powers. so they both should die. THIS IS THE BEST SERIES OF MOVIES EVER AND DON'T BELIEVE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY, BECAUSE IT IS A ILLOSION. \\"THE MATRIX HAS YOU.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|People should be very clear with this, every single reviewr here who gave this movie 1 star is not because this movie is bad made! seriously, all actors were in peak performance especially that old hullucinated lady who should be given some award for her performance on her disturbing character( let's say if u tell me this person in real life is 100% normal, I would call u a fat liar). People only rated this movie 1 star is because of its powerful negativity and how effective it is when u watch through the movie. I rented this DVD along with several \\"Halloween\\" movies that I watch them frist time in my life, I was so surprised how much i got freak out by this movie! its just so forcefully pollute ur thought into another dimension. Let me just say the story is about F**ing up ur mind and it found the way. It makes the scary \\"halloweens\\" pretty cheap like watching batman animated series(although Batman-Ani is actually one of my favorite cartoon shows all time). I dun like this movie at all, but then I admit its destructive power to the extreme, especailly for teh mental side. But then, as usual, they dun round up nothing at the end. Open ending without true answer for their intention, thats how far they can go.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Man this is funny. This is the type of comedy I can keep watching forever. I just saw someone give this a one star. WHAT! This was hilarous. The second one was better though but I still give this a five. On the next scary movie they should make fun of chucky or jason. That would be nice to see
B00005JMJG|5.0|I don't know how many of you would notice that, at the second part of the movie, where Jim tried to save some memories of with Kates, keep running around with her to try to avoid her being cancel, they kept run into phase and phase of Jim's past memories. There I all sudden realise this story is about memory(dreams in another word) traveling with ur girlfriend! I think its just brilliant. Kate and Jim both perform well, so is Kristen, she's not in major role in here, but as always, her acting brigten up the picture a bit in a positive way. Just realise this people, this kindda concept was never been published theaterically before.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie was really good. In my opinion it was the best movie of 2003, BESIDES THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS. Tarintino is a genius. This is the type of action movie I will watch again and again. It would be even better if there were more kill bills. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE WHO LIKES ACTION MOVIES. But if you  don't like cliffhangers this is not for you. This movie ends with bill saying \\"is she aware her daughter still alive\\" which throws you off because you think her daughter is dead. This is a real bloody movie so kids under the age of 12 probably shouldn't watch it. So hide the kids and enjoy this awesome and exciting movie.
0785813500|5.0|There is an array of mixed feelings when it comes to the imcomparable Mr. Poe who, in my opinion, is the greatest of all American writers. The father of the modern mystery and king of the macabre, Poe has created a world of dark yet fascinating literature. The haunting beauty and wonder of poems such as \\"The Raven\\" or \\"Annabelle Lee\\" are irresistable to me. Some people I know have (perhaps understandably so) an aversion to Poe's literature, though I find it strangely refreshing and very exciting. I recommend these stories and poems to anyone who would like a break from the ordinary, wants to explore other less-than-desirable emotions, or needs something to help them experience the darker parts of the heart and mind that are necessary to balance with the more common, more \\"cheerful\\" things.
0380977788|5.0|When Coraline moves into her new flat there is twenty-one windows and fourteen doors. One day she was going around and checking all the doors and what was behind them. When Coraline checked one of the doors it would not unlock, so she tried almost everyday to get it to open and when she did she saw that there was a brick wall on the other side.Coraline one day opened it and saw that the brick wall had vanished,so she decided to go inside. As a result she found out that the other flat was just like hers and had the same rooms,toys and parents. The only problem was that the parents had button eyes and tried to act normal trying to make her feel like she was at home. Coraline soon was seeing strange things, people behind the mirrors,voices telling her to \\"go\\", and the toys would move all by themselves. For example,the toy animals teeth would chatter and the wind up dolls would move. Coraline stopped going over there everyday and went only a couple of hours a week. Finally when she last went over to the other side of the flat the new so called \\"parents\\" told her that she should stay forever, they have everything she wants and that her real parents didn't want her. The new parents with the button eyes told Coraline lies to try to get her to become her daughter and never leave. When Coraline found out what they were doing she made a quick escape and ran to the door, she could hear the parents screaming her name. Later on, Coraline was in her bed on her side of the flat thankful that she had such nice parents and that they were real not evil.
B00006JSS8|4.0|There are just so many people right now that are just into manufactured artists that really don't seem to have a very well put sense of definitive music into the mainstream. From so many acts that are just overexposing the image, and not letting the music speak for itself, it makes acts like Ashanti and Britney Spears just look like they're garbage.  Yet, with so much of the younger generation not reflecting upon older R&B acts, that generation is close to fading away. Still there are some acts that've defined R&B like Stevie Wonder. Since he came out in the 60's, his music has absolutely remained a timeless piece of treasure that has continued to make thousands of people very delighted. Yet, as for greatest hits collections, they always have something missing.<br /><br />Stevie Wonder: The Definitive Collection consists of 21 great tracks that Stevie made into great pop songs from the 60's, 70's and 80's. All of the songs here were remastered beautifully and sound much better than they were released years ago. The collection includes great classic including Do I Do, Uptight, I Just Called To Say I Love You, Overjoyed and You Are The Sunshine Of My Life. All of the standards are well featured here, but there are a few tracks that were just overshadowed from this collection like As, Isn't She Lovely, For Your Love, Go Home, Skeletons and others. Most of these were the same tracks overlooked before from his 1996 Song Review double-album collection.<br /><br />While so much more could've been improved on this collection, Stevie Wonder's longtime fans might overlooking this record in favor of Song Review, or the well-recieved 1999 box set At The Close Of The Century. Yet, this collection is a real delight for anybody who hasn't heard what real soul looks and sounds like.

B00028HBKM|1.0|I found the first half of the film to be very interesting and well done. Fine acting and production values.  Then it turned into an S&M porno movie.  The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene.  It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film.
B000002JR8|3.0|Pantera's follow up to \\"Vulgar display of power\\" is one of the heaviest and hardest albums you'll ever hear. Starting off in a furious tempo with \\"Strength beyond strength\\", they prove their ability. It's as hard, fast and heavy as it gets - all at once. But does it rock? I'm afraid not. Unfortunately that's a bit sympomatic for the entire album. <br /> <br />I personally think \\"Shedding skin\\" is the best song on this album; a heavier and slower version of a similar riff that Metallica used in \\"Jump in the fire\\". Heavy and rythmic. There are other such tendencies on the album, but often with focus on heavy or heavy and fast. <br /> <br />Lyrically the album is almost as bad as it gets. \\"Legalise drugs\\" is about the most constructive message. Hating Christians, despising Jesus, and having sex with another man's girlfriend are other themes. I usually don't mind when the lyrics are kind of bad, but there are limits. <br /> <br />The album ends with a cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\". It's a good song, done with skills, but quite similar to the original. This is also quite symptomatic of the entire album. Pantera were GREAT mucisians, but on this album they didn't display their creativity. Only their power. And, yes, it gets vulgar.
B000683VI4|4.0|I remember first seeing the trailer for \\"The Notebook\\" and the emotional reaction I had when I figured out what the story was about.  I know that the movie is based on Nicholas Sparks' best-selling first novel, but I have never read it or anything else he has written, so I was worried that the film might have been ruined for me.  Still, \\"Titanic\\" did pretty well and everybody knew the ship was going to sink, and happily I can report that in similar fashion the best moment of this 2004 romantic drama will reduce you to tears because you know the complete set up.<br /><br />In the present at a nursing home, Duke (James Garner) shows up to read to a nicely dressed woman (Gena Rowlands), who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  Reading from a notebook, he tells her a story set before World War II when young Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) met the beautiful Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams).  The problem is that her family comes from money, spending the summer at their home in the country, and he is a laborer, so while her father, John (David Thornton) at least wants to meet the young man his daughter is seeing, her mother, Anne (Joan Allen) is vehemently opposed.  The young couple end up having a big fight, Allie's mother drags her back home, and then along comes World War II.  Noah goes overseas to fight, while Allie becomes a nurse and meets Lon Hammond (James Marsden).<br /><br />The story of the rich girl loving the poor boy has become rather clich&eacute;d, and if you do not know what happened to all those letters Noah wrote to Allie for an entire year you have simply not seen your yearly allotment of movie romances.  Fortunately, \\"The Notebook\\" comes through in the grand gesture department, which is where the poor boy has to do something that will impress at least the young girl (and hopefully her family and all other naysayers).  What is nice about this particular grand gesture is that it is not only appropriately symbolic of their love, it also has significant material benefits.  There is also a nice scene when the film's villain, Mrs. Hamilton, finally has a serious talk with her daughter (and explains why Joan Allen signed up for a supporting role).<br /><br />Gosling and McAdams are both good as the young couple, although the effort to keep the PG-13 rating in the sex scenes becomes rather obvious, and the script actually refrains from having Marsden do or say anything incredible stupid as the odd side out of this love triangle.  But every time we come back to the present Garner and Rowlands are stealing the film.  The flaw of this film, if you want to consider it as such, is that I end up being a lot more interested in the framing device with the old couple than with the main story.  Meanwhile I was distracted by the idea that maybe what I thought was going on was actually not going on (there are a few red herrings regarding Duke), and I became rather enamored by those possibilities.  Still, there is a reason that people are talking about \\"The Notebook\\" as being a tearjerker movie and the big moment is quite effective.  Those who do not care for such fare will know to stay away, and those who love weeping their eyes out at romances will be satisfied with what they find here.ial benefits.

B000002JOH|5.0|For many Pantera was the logical place to go, after being hooked on heavier music by Metallica. They were harder and heavier, but the songs were still good - actually these songs sometimes swing more than less heavy songs.  <br /> <br />Technically they were amazing; from fast rythmic drums to agressive compelling vocals, with tight bass and guitar riffs in between, and incredibly fine solos on top.  <br /> <br />Compared to their follow up (\\"Far beyoond driven\\"), this album has one decisive advantage: \\"Vulgar\\" isn't about showing how hard and heavy they can be, it's about making the music rock, and the heaviness in an integrated part of that. That's why the tempo on the songs seems to be determined by what sounds good and suits the melody, not what would impress. Well of course, \\"F-ing Hostile\\" is fast, but in a good fun way and it still rocks. Compared to the earlier \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", this is consistently heavier. But it's good heavy. I think you get the point. <br /> <br />I think this is the album Darell Abott is most likely to be remebered for. R.I.P.
B00009V8Z9|1.0|Sorry people, this album is barely listenable. I got it based on the catchy single \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" thinking it may have some merit or at least a couple more good tracks. Apparently I was sadly mistaken. On first listen I thought it really can't be this bad, can it? So I played it again, and a third time. It just got worse. The lyrics are inane - the only comparison I can draw is that he is the male version of Ashlee Simpson. It's kinda like a movie that looks great based on the trailers, only to find out that you've already seen all the good parts on the commercial. Do yourself a favor - DL the song (or God forbid, songs) you like, and spend your money on a real singer-songwriter like Jason Mraz or Ben Harper.
B00005JNEI|1.0|What a bunch of HYPE. In my humble opinion, Michael Moore would have been the supreme propaganda agent for the Nazi movement and for Hitler himself. This guy should have been a figure skater because he spins better than \\"Slick Willie\\" Clinton.<br /><br />If you are the type that vote straight democratic ticket because you father (or grandfather) did purely due to recovering from the Great Deppresion, you will enjoy it.<br /><br />If you are open minded and would rather research the facts on your own, you will undoubtedly either refuse to watch/hear these lies or view it to see how the liberal mind works.They all seem  Paranoid and they think that our government should practice socialism and tell us how to think?
0393057658|5.0|Then I read \\"Moneyball.\\"  Michael Lewis opened my eyes to nuances of the game I had not even considered.  I played <br />the game, watched the game, and read every baseball book <br />I could find.  This one challenged me to consider the <br />absurd way players are valued in the imperfect baseball <br />marketplace, and to question the very statistics I thought <br />defined excellence in the game.  I am giving this book <br />to my Father because he's both a former ballplayer and <br />an economist.  He will love this book.
B000669GAI|4.0|Pearl Jam has made a career out of wanting to be an indie band but being too talented to do so. They made 1 legitimate music video for Jeremy and literally began to fall off the face of the earth. Being a huge PJ fan, I am incredibly biased but in all honesty this hits collection encompasses the band the best way anyone could have. Die-hard \\"jammers\\" such as myself will moan for the more obscure hits to have made the cut but what can we do? The Brendan O'Brien remixes are awesome. Especially the Even Flow remix, which is the version they used for the live music video which got some love on mTV back in the day. If I had to pick one song that I wish could have gotten on here that didn't? \\"In My Tree\\" off 1996's No Code. Not only is that song amazing that entire album was severly under appreciated. The fact that they are not the most popular band on the planet is mind blowing. To this day they are still able to rock. Evidence of this is shown on RVM 1991-2003 with the songs \\"Save You\\" and \\"I Am Mine\\" from their newest studio album Riot Act making the cut. Other songs I wouldve added: Porch, Glorified G (surprisingly the song I hear most on the radio by PJ these days), Tremor Christ, In Hiding, MFC, Sleight of Hand.....you get the picture. To any fan of any one PJ song, buy this album and discover what youve been missing out on after Ten and Vs. came out. <br /> <br />*See this band live before you die. <br /> <br />oh yeah and to the guy who said epic was trying to cash in one last time: they had a contract with sony for 7 studio albums, a b-side/rarity album, and a greatest hits. so this had to come out for their contract to expire.
B0000549B2|2.0|I am normally a Spike Lee fan. It takes some time to really get into his \\"mojo\\", but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled (two of my favorite films of his), there was no clear story in this film. I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out. Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not Lee's favorite film. Not only did Lee direct this film, but he also wrote it. You could tell. The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film. This film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty. Lee was not 100% behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing. Of all the films I have seen Lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films. It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own. I don't know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it, or what ... but this film did not demonstrate his true talent.<br /><br />For anyone out there that has seen this film, and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film, I suggest you give him a second chance. Don't get me wrong, I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you, but Lee does grow up. His work becomes more of his own, and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films. It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour, but when I did, it was sheer brilliance. Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown. I guess that is what I was hoping Mo' Better Blues would turn out to be. This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up, but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel. He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema, but this was not the film to showcase his talent.<br /><br />Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike's sister playing one of the love interests. I don't know about you, and your family, but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister. I don't care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid, I would never do it. It is just something that I never wish to see, but apparently that is different for Spike. He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse. It was sad and it even made me blush. Also, I need somebody to answer me this. What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film? So, I am sitting there on my couch, ready to start the film, when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film, then he acknowledges himself. That did not build for a strong remaining of the story. Again, I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent. Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions.<br /><br />There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end. Don't get me wrong, this was a very bad movie, but there is always a diamond in every alleyway. The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing. He continually went back and forth, weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera. It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes. The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film. By keeping the same pacing and direction, he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life.  Other than these two moments, the rest of the film was pure rubbish, not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****the chance to change his life.  Other than these two moments, the rest of the film was pure rubbish, not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind. <br /> <br />Grade: ** out of *****
B00005R23X|5.0|In an exercise of cosmic madness, the essence of vampire lore is born with Count Dracula and his centuries-long yearning for the deceased Mina, an erotic love story lost in a netherworld of dreamless musings.<br /><br />In this sensual feast of images, saturated with thick, red blood, an epic struggle is waged, a battle for eternity. Count Dracula purchases real estate in Victorian London, transferring crates of Transylvanian earth, where he will rest by day, pursuing the reincarnated Mina (Winona Ryder) by night. Mina is engaged to Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves in a particularly wooden and unctuous performance), the young man sent to transact business with the Count in Transylvania. Trapped in the Dracula's castle and unable to return to London, Dracula's three ex-wives petulantly drain the young man's blood to ensure his passivity. If they drained much more fluid, the insipid Harker would be dead, his acting so inanimate as to appear purposefully comedic.<br /><br />Not to worry. Gary Oldman, as the Count, makes up for any flaws in Coppola's vision of Bram Stoker's Dracula, resplendent as the wizened vampire with taloned fingers, his eyes cloudy with memory. Appearing in London to claim his prize, Oldman is a suave boulevardier, who has no difficulty attracting the damsel's attentions (consider the alternative), eventually siphoning off a quart or so of her blood, his eyes rolling back in an ecstasy of content.<br /><br />As Dracula's lost love, Mina (Ryder) at first appears as stiff as her intended (Reeves), passionless and prim, a perfectly repressed Victorian. However, once infused with the elixir of immortality, the lady perks right up and shows her mettle (and incipient fangs), writhing in vampiric agony, tormented by her blood lust for the Count.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, but especially stunning when the fleshly concupiscence of the female form is contrasted with a dark need for transfusion. One particularly memorable character is Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra. Thrashing with urgency, the titian-haired Lucy's throat is nightly bared to her seducer, sinking inexorably toward death, yet glowing in her new-fanged vulnerability, only to be reborn in the crypt. Unfortunately, this juicy morsel falls victim to the vampire slayer's sword, post-mortem. Two other impressive roles are filled by Tom Waits as the bug-crunching, straight-jacketed Renfield and Richard E. Grant as his hollowed-eyed, drug-addled doctor/keeper.<br /><br />For all the mist-shrouded roads and menacing packs of wolves, it is Mina who rocks when calling forth the storm's fury in a bid to shield Dracula from the burning rays of the sun, shouting incantations as a posse rides to cut the Count off at the proverbial pass. Led by an overweening Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), the do-gooders, including the pale visage of Jonathan Harker, plan Dracula's ultimate destruction: a stake through the heart and off with his head. At the moment of truth, Mina confronts Jonathan, asking if this is to be her fate as well. But the men withdraw on the order of a pontificating Van Helsing, \\"We've all become God's madmen!\\" It is left to the compassionate Mina to free her decadent love, releasing them both to the land of myth: \\"Our love is stronger than death.\\" One can only hope.

B0000028M7|5.0|one of the best albums of the grunge era, \\"dirt\\" is dark yet beautiful. layne staley's vocals are really amazing...its such a shame that he had to die cause he was one of the best vocalists of all time. jerry cantrell's guitars are toneful and set the mood for each song along with lanye's vocals. at times you will hear the two sing together. on  songs like \\"rooster\\",\\"would?\\", and \\"angry chair\\". anyone who listens to rock music should have this in their collection. a masterpiece.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a wonderful record and Michael Buble has the vocal chops to woo audiences everywhere. The choice of materials, the production, the arrangements.....all are quite divine. \\"Feeling Good\\" and \\"Song For You\\" are but two of the fabulous covers..the self written track \\"Home\\" (reminescent of Christopher Cross) <br />is worthy of top positioning on AC radio charts. If you love <br />real music, lyrics and an honest approach to both, this a  <br />must have cd.......a perfect gift for Valentines Day.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|This is a love-it-or-hate-it movie if there ever was one.  OK, I don't think anybody out there will call it \\"great,\\" but it is definitely unique.  The type of person who will hate it, I think, is the one who has know love (or knowledge) of the pop-culture of yesteryear.  Let me put it this way - if you've never seen the original King Kong, you're not going to like this film. <br /> <br />I was reminded of King Kong all the way through Sky Captain.  The film tries to capture the sense of wonder from depression-era sci-fi.  It takes place in an alternate history where the Hindenburg III blimp docks at the Empire State Building.  Everything is art deco - huge open spaces are the norm. <br /> <br />It's true, the story should have been better - there is little dramatic tension because everything is so tongue-in-cheek, you don't really take anything on screen seriously.  But, in the end, this film is all about look - and it looks great.   <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Where did Michael Buble come from? <br /> <br />I never heard of him until I got this CD-ROM.  He is an awesome talent. <br /> <br />It's Time is a great set of songs! <br />
B0006399FS|3.0|I've had the new U2 album, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,\\" for about three months now and I am finally ready to review it. Full disclosure, I am a huge U2 fan, going back more than 14 years. I am one of those geeks that buys the singles, goes to the shows and follows the band on the internet.  <br /> <br />So when I finally got my new U2 disc in the mail, I didn't even bother to open it for a week because I had already downloaded it.  It came clear after just a couple of listens that \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is actually \\"All That you Can't Leave Behind\\" part 2.  The albums have the same feel look and taste with equal an equal share of rockers ballads and emo tracks.  <br /> <br />I have no doubt that U2 really tried hard. In fact, I think they tired too hard. The songs are too wordy, too long and too generic. The more I listen to it, the more one dimensional the songs become.  Most of the tracks have specific messages, lack layered meaning and just aren't fun enough.  This is a serious album by a serious band that fails to connect.   <br /> <br />At the end of the day, I think U2 missed the boat with production. They needed to mix things up a bit. They could have worked with a younger producer or brought in more vocalists for duets and used background vocals.  It is almost like the band is caught in a trap that every track has to be written and song by Bono.  Overall I am disappointed. If I had been producing I would have thrown out half the songs and sent the band back into the studio. Maybe after several years with only half an album to show for it, they just gave up.  <br /> <br />Two and half stars  <br />
B000059QYB|4.0|this is good, but not every song is a classic.
B000002LIX|5.0|I bought this album back when it came out in the early nineties.  I played it for days on end on my pathetic little tape deck in my bedroom. After a couple of days my mother came to me asking me who it was. Now, you have to understand that the closest thing to popular/contemporary music my mother ever liked was the earliest stuff put out by the Beatles.  Unless it's classical, opera, ballet, etc., she has virtually no interest... until the nineties with the last four songs of this cd (or the second side of the cassette). <br /> <br />The musical range along with the experimentation on this album brought it to a level where too few musicians are willing to tread. If they did, there might be more masterpieces such as this. This music makes me miss the early nineties. <br /> <br />Nirvana was great, but Jane's Addiction was even better.
B00005614M|5.0|Miles Davis is awesome - Birth of the Cool deserves 50 stars.
0783240236|4.0|I loved The Birds. Tippi Hedron does a very convincing job playing the spoiled socialite. Very understated and not something one would expect from a girl who loves practical jokes and swimming nude in fountains. In fact she appears to be quite the opposite, which makes it so convincing. No stereotype here (although I wondered how she was able to walk around in those stilletos all the time without her feet getting sore).<BR>Rod Taylor is handsome and caring as Mitch and together they make a good looking couple.<BR>Hitchcock takes his time with this movie. There's no rushing it as Melanie smokes a cigarette while the birds gather behind her. And yet it's still interesting to watch.<BR>There's backstory here with interesting family dynamics.<BR>Now the problems I had with the movie.<BR>The romance seems sudden. Melanie and Mitch don't know each other and yet they are suddenly in the kitchen touching and acting as if they had been a couple for awhile. Wouldn't Mitch find it strange that a woman would suddenly show up on his doorstep with lovebirds? Kind of eerie. Yet he invites her to stay the weekend.<BR>When they birds are attacking them in the house, no one says a word, there are no screams, is that realistic? Spooky yes, but realistic?<BR>The scene with the children running from the school may have been convincing in it's day (good job Hitch) but now it does look fake although it's easy enough to put the fakeness aside for the fear of seeing those birds attack the children.<BR>Mitch took the time boarding up the windows. This bothered me most about the movie. Wouldn't it have made more sense to grab his family and take them to his apartment in San Francisco? Why spend time boarding windows?<BR>That house wasn't very well built since the birds were able to peck their way through outside walls and roofs.<BR>Why did Melanie go upstairs. Why not call Mitch to come with her? And why did she shut herself in the room. You don't actually walk in. You would shine the light,see the birds and quickly shut the door.<BR>When they did decide to finally leave, they chose to drive Melanie's convertable with the cloth roof instead of the sturdier truck. If the birds are going to attack, wouldn't they peck their way through the roof?<BR>Still in spite of this I did enjoy the movie and the end was perfect. It left you with questions which is what the director probably meant to do.<BR>I still prefer the much quieter Hitchcock movie &quot;Rope&quot; where two young men kill their friend and then hide him in the trunk where they serve a buffet at a dinner party.
B0006B29Z2|4.0|I agree with everything that has been said.  They do play the same songs over and over again in the concert footage.  I was shocked at the quality of the concert footage and the sound.  The documentry is really informative and honest, seeing all the old members was really interesting and how they go through all the different lineups.
0800177177|5.0|Truly one of the best adaptation of the novel by Bram Stoker. The acting(except for Keannu Reeves), cinematography, costumes, special effects, screen play are superb. FFC succeeded in what other directors failed: Humanizing our infamous bloodsucker. Instead of concentrating on the gore, he opted to focus on the romance between Minas and Dracula. We are led to believed that what he is doing, no matter how horrible, are all done in the name of his undying love to his bride. It is a must see for everyone.
B00064MW6A|1.0|I really didn't think Catwoman was going to be as bad as everyone says it is. I thought I would give it a chance since I am a fan of Halle Berry. There were so many bad things about this movie that I can't even list them all. The acting by all 3 leads is terrible, especially Sharon Stone who basically made a fool out of herself with this role. The dialogue is horrendous and laughable. Catwomans costume is rediculous, and the fight sequences, especially between Halle Berry and Sharon Stone is just laughable. Why oh why would the people working on this fil think it was worth anything. It's terrible. The only saving grace is Frances Conroy who brings some type of life to her role as the one who explains who Catwoman is. I enjoyed her scenes, and that would be it. I highly recommend watching this film just to see how bad movie making can be.
0385510454|1.0|I was disappointed in this book.  It was boring, boring and really boring.  There was no story.  JAM who cared? To many characters with nothing to contribute.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is a truly interesting album. When I first started listening to it, I didn't know what to think of it. It was recommended to me since I'm a huge Scissor Sisters fan. They are not at all alike in their sound. Once I got past that assumed similarity and listened to them on their own merit, I started to \\"get\\" them. <br />Sometimes sounding like Blur, early Thompson Twins, Generation X, and early new wave (in general), they are actually a group that can stand on its own. Their songs are catchy, if not hummable, and they have a very unique song to song quality while maintaining a similar creative thread throughout. <br />This is definitely Euro music - which is definitely my preference. <br />Punkish and Europop mixed together. It works.  Check it out!
B000068IEU|3.0|Before watching this film, I read many reviews. I prepared myself for a scary trip.  It was not scary.  It was tense and uncomfortable, at best.  Once I realized I was not going to be freaked out or psycologically damaged, I began to watch the film for the piece of history that it is.  It WAS ground breaking for it's time, and it does have some great moments: 1. After Mari's rape, the recognition by the gang members that they have crossed a terrible line and that they were now changed forever, 2.  The chicken-truck lady, and 3: the doctor & nurse scene, to name a few.  Watch this movie with a spirit of nostalgia and analysis, and you won't be disapointed.  If you are looking for a terrifying ride, move on.
B000696PWC|5.0|Another Kylie Minogue greatest hits album. I can hear people groaning since one comes out every few years. This one is pretty comprehensive, covering her early career to where she is now. This album is a true testament of her artistry. A lot of people didn't think she would last, and she's certainly had her ups and down, but somehow always ends up on top. The album features two new songs, the disco anthem \\"I Believe In You\\", and her new single \\"Giving You Up\\". Goes all the way from her early hits like \\"Locomotion\\", \\"What Do I Have To Do\\", \\"Better The Devil You Know\\", to later hits like \\"On A Night Like This\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Chocolate\\", and more. A worthy buy!
B000003C2U|5.0|This is a Terrific album!!! ( but then again.. ALL of DEATH's albums are!!!) Being that this is album number 4 the production is alot better then on previous albums.

LONG LIVE DEATH!!and LONG LIVE METAL!!
0871359448|5.0|I'm a big fan of comic writers taking a stab at what could be considered the final story for a character.  I've endured a never-ending loop of stories about my favorites, and every so often, it's nice to see someone take their shot at wrapping it up. Batman has \\"Dark Knight Returns\\", the Avengers have \\"The Last Avengers Story\\", and in 1990, Thanos kinda-sorta received his, courtesy of writer Jim Starlin and artists George Perez and Ron Lim.  To many readers, THE INFINITY GAUNTLET  established Thanos as one of the major villains in the Marvel Universe, leading to bigger and better things, but I look at it in another way. I feel that THE INFINITY GAUNTLET can serve as the perfect \\"last Thanos story\\", and I prefer it as such, instead of it leading to more stories, such as Infinity War and Infinity Watch.<br /><br />THE INFINITY GAUNTLET is a continuation of a story that originated in both the regular Silver Surfer series and the THANOS QUEST limited series.  The gauntlet is perhaps the most powerful item in the Marvel Universe, as it bestows upon the wearer absolute control over time, space, power, the soul, the mind, and reality.  Thanos obtains the gauntlet in order to finally win the hand of his love, Death, through the elimination of half the population of the entire universe.  A group of Marvel heroes, one villain, and a host of cosmic characters, come together to stop him, and he fends them off with the sort of casual anoyance that any god would.  Adam Warlock, however, is onto Thanos' game and has his own tricks up his sleeve.  Warlock's true plan leads to a conclusion that I never expected in one of Jim Starlin's super-duper cosmic epics, but it makes sense and is an ironic finale for a character like Thanos.  If only it could have stayed that way.  In any case, pick up this book and prepare for a great read.

0374384584|5.0|One of the best books of one of the best authors in the world. What more can you ask for? <br /> <br />The Witches is a story about a young boy who lives with his cigar-smoking Norwegian grandmother, and who comes into conflict with the witches of the world. As he soon learns, witches don't ride about on broomsticks or wear tall pointed hats. In fact, they takes great pains to blend in with the rest of society, and only a knowledgeable observer can detect them via a series of clues about their appearance. The boy gets a crash course in witchery when he and his grandmother check into a hotel which, coincidentally, is hosting an annual meeting of the society of witches.  <br /> <br />This book has all of the Dahlisms that make this author so special. There are entertaining sub-stories that are fascinating in their own right, as when Grandmother relates her childhood experience with a witch. There are grand and daring plans that may or may not work out as the planner intends. Moreso than in other Dahl books, the villainesses are downright creepy, and a child who reads it may find him or herself surreptitiously checking out women for signs that they are witches.  <br /> <br />The inventiveness, the humor, and the excitement of this book come through on every page, and no child will be bored during this story. There's a feeling that Dahl and his child readers are collaborating on something magical, bold, and a little naughty, and this sense of camraderie conveys itself to the childhood readers. <br /> <br />Of all the Dahl books, this has to be one of the three or four best, and the ending, which isn't remotely tidy or ideal, may be shocking. The movie was kind of okay, but doesn't hold a candle to this exciting book.  <br /> <br />For entertainment purposes, I couldn't recommend it more. <br />
B000002X2B|2.0|...one star for Kantner's mushy vocals. Still worth hearing, but thank Grace for the fast-forward (which us old vinyl types did not have available to us). The poor schmoe never could carry a tune.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This album totally kicks ass. I have loaded the cd on to my ipod and out of the 10,000 songs i have to choose from, i find myself scrolling down to My Chemical Romance. I have been listening to punk music for the better of my life. I also work at a record shop and get the chance to indulge in whatever music i wish. So when i see poeple beefing on MCR it tweaks me a little bit.(Josh) Overall I think anyone would enjoy this album and it would be a shame not to take a peak.  <br />Thanks hope this is helpful
B00005JLWN|5.0|Silly, predictable, seriously flawed, with moments that are outright laughable, Equilibrium nonetheless transcends all of these and through its compelling performances and fun pseudo-comic book settings delivers a powerful emotional punch that should resonate strongly for anyone who loves stark, stylistic Orwellian drama.   <br /> <br />In a future dominated by Father (with a not so subtle nod to \\"Big Brother\\"), emotions have been eliminated and feeling is a crime, punished by immediate incineration - along with things like art, music, literature, friendship, love and everything else that makes life worth living.  Wisely, there is an underground rebellion contingency who continue to \\"live.\\"  Among them, Emily Watson's saintly, emotional Mary O'Brien.  These folk are, naturally, hunted down by the Grammaton Clerics, that physically fit bastion of unfeeling purity out to uphold and enforce the law.   <br /> <br />Christian Bale as Cleric John Preston gives a performance that is simply terrific offering a fascinating character study.  One witnesses in anticipation as, throughout the slow process Preston's emotion free automaton - the pride of the Tetragrammaton - evolves into freedomfighter and ultimately liberator. Watch as, for the first time, Preston listens to music (the opening measures of Beethoven's 9th Symphony) and through his face captures and reveals the range of awe and wonderment as though awakening from a lifelong coma.  Bale is more than up to the task as we watch his Cleric struggle with his newfound duplicity and makes route for him, but still believe the man may very well fail his mission.   <br /> <br />Director, Kurt Wimmer, in what appears to be his first big screen directorial job, has created an entire new, faux martial arts: \\"Gun-Kata.\\"   Gun-Kata is a highly stylized combination of two handed gun fighting and classic tai-chi/martial arts movement based on \\"a scientific analysis of bullet trajectory and range\\" combined with mathematics, etc.  Atfirst, it is almost painfully hilarious to watch, but give in and it achieves a type of anime, hyper realistic that can only be described as \\"wicked cool!\\"    <br /> <br />Bale's Preston is THE master of Gun-Kata and as he inevitably goes after \\"Father\\" his penultimate fight with former partner Taye Diggs' will leave you cheering. <br /> <br />Like a great conductor, Wimmer brings together all of the disparate elements of his symphony with its wordless, choral based soundtrack, jumps every hurdle and flaw, delivering a terrific movie full of action, meaning and emotion.
0375701427|3.0|I admit that not being an American might exclude me from fully getting out of the book what Philip Roth put into it. Closing in on the last page, what remains in my mind is an epic story about a family and America in general, that drags on and on, that is so long that one could have cut out half of the pages and still would remember it as broad. Despite these drawbacks, Philip Roth's writing kept me reading on, curious to find out why the main character's daughter became a terrorist, what the root cause was that derailed this \\"American dream\\" family. Having finsihed the book, I am still wondering.
B0000024SI|5.0|Every time I put this cd in the player Mr. Dylan's words swirl and cascade through my head.  It's like being at a carnival where the sights, sounds and smell overwhelm your senses and you find yourself transported to an altered state of mind.  And when you put that into the context of the turbulent 60s those of you who want to know what all the fuss is about Bob might get a real good idea.  No one else was doing this.  No one.  It's so original that it is impossible to find any hint of influences.  It is raw and refined all at the same time.  Truly amazing music and words.
B00001OH7T|3.0|Having re-listened to this album just recently, I must say that it is simply not as good as I remembered it to be.  While stand-out tracks such as the title song, \\"Fame\\" and \\"Fascination\\" are stylistic philly soul-meets-glam workouts, the remainder is ladened with overwrought vocals, muddy production, and heavy-handed strings, horns, and choruses that obscure the thin songwriting at its core.<br /><br />Interestingly, to me it is no coincidence John Lennon appears with Bowie on this disk -- this album shares the same production missteps that John made on his 1974 Walls and Bridges album, as well as John's production butchering of Harry Nilsson's 1974 Pussy Cats.  Guess the coke was particularly strong for these guys that year, but all of them have made better records, with less bells-and-whistles.  It's worth picking up for the standout tracks, as well as the reissue's addition of a 1974 remake of \\"John, I'm Only Dancing Again,\\" which re-imagines this Bowie standard as a funky New York soul rave-up.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|first off i must say i was extremely excited to find that upon recieving this wonderful dvd via mail, that there were 2 discs inside. One with extra commentaries (with english subtitles) along with extra songs not shown on the first disc, and the main disc containing 20 amazing BG songs, all of which I love! <br />  Blind Guardian had a marvelous and magical night when this concert was filmed (by at least 20 cameras if i remember correctly) and thus it shows thanks to the wonderful displays of musicianship and vocal talents of Hansii, oh yeah, and the other great things such as the light spectacular, pyro technics, and wonderful use of a catwalk for Hansii. I have never seen that done before for a band (i believe it must have been done by alot of others) but Blind Guardian in my opinion are the only band that should incorporate a catwalk. Hansii seemed to give a more personal connection to the audiance, and the sense that many stories were being told was created better by giving Hansii this freedom to move into the crowd, kind of like a story teller explaining a wonderful fantasy creation via campfire or in a tavern somewhere far beyond. <br />  Overall everything from the visuals to the sound quality is remarkably amazing, and i can not get over the wonderfull track listing for the concert. Expecially with \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" which i never would of imagined BG attempting to do on stage, but not only did they attempt playing it but they succeded in presenting it even better than it is on the cd \\"Night of the Opera\\" for the most part. <br />  all in all this dvd should get 10 out of 5 stars, and if you are a fan of Blind Guardian, either die hard or just appreciate them, then you should view this wonderfull display of creative genius.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is the story of a small town kid trying to find his way through the maze of high school, friendships, family, and romance. Unfortunately Napoleon encounters the roadblocks of an insane family, a total lack of social skills, and a geeky appearance. I loved this movie. We all knew Napoleon Dynamite in high school. Hell, some of us were Napoleon Dynamite in high school. It's that feeling of connection that makes this film so fun and heart-warming. There were a few moments in the movie in which I knew I was laughing at the awkwardness of this geeky kid, but more often, I knew that I was laughing at myself, at the awkwardness that I felt as  a kid. And who among us hasn't been morbidly embarrassed by our family members just as Napoleon is.
0061015725|4.0|The unexpected great ideas are crammed into this book written by the author of Jurassic Park! For example, a unique strategic airborne camera could be made of the nano-technology machines of molecular level, which could be formed by making it a \\"swarm\\" in the air. The swarming and the unswarming will be made possible by their own free will by the autonomous allocation of the roles of various camera parts. In the war time it will be a very convenient tool to use because that camera can't be shot down and could be disintegrated into the molecule level parts in such cases. It is seemingly an ultimate machine, but it has a fatal weak point of being easily swept away by the wind! The responsible research company can't get the necessary fund raised from the sponsors because of this fatality, and begins dangerous wrongdoings... .<br /><br />Like other Crichton stories, the uncontrolled swarms go out of the laboratory and start attacking people as a kind of monster. By the strenuous efforts of mankind, the danger is finally gone. But was it really exterminated? This is the usual Crichton endings! We can expect the sequels to this story and the movies as well.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Simply put, Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, and Sticky Fingers are three of the best albums of all time. These remastered versions bring these classics to life in a way that the previous CD mixes did not. Thanks, Abkco, for finally giving these albums their due. <br /> <br />I have not had a chance to listen to the SACD layer yet but hope to soon. <br /> <br />One parting comment: down this list of reviews a way you'll find a one-star \\"review\\" by someone calling himself \\"Loyalist,\\" who's some kind of Beatles fanatic. The entirety of his review is this: <br /> <br />\\"Ttile [sic] sound familiar? That's because the Beatles already released and [sic] album called Let It Be. The Rolling Rip-Offs strike again!\\" <br /> <br />Loyalist, you need to get acquainted with something called The Truth.

1577314808|4.0|I believe that many of the criticisms leveled below against Tolle's book are really the result of perspective. I, too, had difficulty trying to achieve the serenity by the means given in this book. I eventually found another way to achieve a level of peace and joy that I could only imagine before. From this new perspective, 'The Power of Now' makes perfect sense. The mind is of limited use in the pursuit of the spiritual. I wasn't ready then for the information he gave and my path was not through the techniques described his the book. Yet, the same principles Tolle discusses are now in my present practice. This doesn't mean Eckhart Tolle was wrong. There many different ways of expressing the same truths. Rather than knocking something that doesn't make sense to you, keep looking until you find your path. Books, such as 'The Power of Now', are only helpful guides to your own answers.
B0007CEXZO|4.0|For anyone who is a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, this version has commentary from MST3K's own Michael J. Nelson. Not to distract from Carnival of Souls, which, in itself is a cult classic that looks absolutely beautiful in full color. For those enthusiasts, the B&W version is also included. <br /> <br />I got my version several months ago when they were still the Mike Nelson autograph edition. His commentary is very much like watching an episode of MST3K. He throws in many one-liners and includes some great trivia about the movie. <br /> <br />My advice is to buy this movie, whether you like cult horror movies, good laughs, or both.
0618526412|3.0|What struck me the most about this book was how much the writing reminded me of Steinbeck or Hemmingway.  If you like that writing and story telling, you will probably like this book.  I never did understand why they were such acclaimed writers.  There is something about this book - like it's trying to tell you something, but you just don't know what.  Trying to be clever, but maybe too clever for me.  The writing is very plain, but not direct.  Am I too shallow or simple that I would like a plot? <br /> <br />I know a lot of the acclaim over this book is that a white writer could so accurately portray the thoughts of black people.  This was amazing because of the time that this book was written.  But, a classic should be timeless.  We should be able to be impressed by the book regardless of when it was written. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this book doesn't hold up to that standard.

0451167716|4.0|Don Vito Corleone continues to be a fictional figurehead of the American mafia's underworld.  He is the portrait of a modern mafia boss, despite being thirty five years old and set in the 1940s.  The Godfather is about power.  Don Corleone's insatiable desire for power combined with a total refusal to play by someone else's rules-i.e. the government, created an amiable but villainous Don in control of the greater part of New York City's underworld.  He is heralded as an angel-granting alms, help, justice, equity, protection, citizenship and whatever else you can imagine.  Puzo makes you revere Don Corleone, like all of those poor people whom he has helped over the years of his reign.  Granting favors is how he remains with so much power, innumerous people owe him for the \\"good deeds\\" he has done them.   <br /> <br />Unlike other mafia novels, Puzo ensures that the blood and the gore take second stage to the decision to exercise power.  After reading the explanations and unfortunate circumstances that these characters find themselves in, there is no choice but to exercise power by making their enemies \\"an offer they can't refuse.\\"  Why and when Corleone exercises power is the interesting point in The Godfather, because it demonstrates how and in what circumstances he loves possessing power. <br />   <br />With all of the talk of Don Vito Corleone, he is not the true protagonist.  Michael is.  Michael Corleone, the third son and most like his father.  The second key theme of the novel is the importance of the family.  Michael was an idealist, not interested in working in the \\"family business.\\"  But after unfortunate circumstances of Don Corleone's attempted assassination, Michael must step up and fill the vacancy in his father's war room.  He is essentially forced into his crimes through loyalty to his family.  This loyalty is instilled in him at an early age by his father, learned as an age-old Sicilian adage and necessity. <br /> <br />Michael's internal conflict between desiring a legitimate life and following his father's footsteps is the main conflict of the book.  Unfortunately, Puzo does not develop Michael enough to fully leverage this conflict into powerful writing.  The plot points which drive Michael to eventually become Don Corleone himself are sufficient to explain why he made the decisions he made.  For example, the necessary hit of Sollozzo and the assassination of his new bride drove him deeper into the family business.  But Puzo lacks clear manifestations of an ongoing internal struggle that he set up Michael to have: he wants to be legitimate-he wants to live a normal life but can't because he is a Corleone.  Puzo's only good example of Michael's desire for legitimacy is how he tries to withdraw the Corleone's from New York and take them to Las Vegas.  But this seems more of an idea of Don Vito's than Michael's.  Without directly writing Michael's internal dialogue, Puzo could include more conversations and evidence that he is truly struggling with his decision. <br /> <br />As the all-time bestselling novel in publishing history, The Godfather has an intricate plot with many distinct and intriguing characters that keep you guessing what happens next. <br />
6305603847|5.0|Okay,<br /><br />I have read all the different reviews of this movie, and how it is a movie fraught between three different artist (Waters, Parker and Scarfe) who were trying to put forth thier art onto this movie individually (and sometimes together -waters/scarfe).  This is a valid point, and you can (after being told to look for these things individually) find that some of the points made by these pundits to be somewhat on the mark.<br /><br />There should be some note of the obvious... if you hire a person to direct, if you hire a person to write, and you hire an artist to make cartoons... they are, by virture of being artist themselves, portray the art as they see it.<br /><br />Could be there were too many cooks in the kitchen, I am not sure.<br /><br />ALL I KNOW is that I have always loved this movie since I first saw it as a teen ager, and I still repurchase it when my copy either gets destroyed/stolen/permanently 'borrowed'.  It is a movie that has scenes that are captivating, and emotional and they all are acted out brilliantly.<br /><br />That to me is what makes a good movie a good movie.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appriciates good art.  (and the music is excellent as well).<br /><br />Have fun
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is one of the best pieces of literature ever written.  Mario Puzo paints this elaborate picture of the Sicilian mafia through the eyes of Michael Corleone, a returning Marine Corps hero who at first wants nothing to do with the elaborate crime family that his father has built.  <br /> <br />Don Vito Corleone, an Italian immigrant who goes from poverty in Little Italy to create one of the Five Families of New York with the help of his friends Peter Clamenza and Salvatore Tessio. <br /> <br />His inferiors include his sons, the short tempered Santino \\"Sonny\\", the clumsy Fredo, and of course Michael.  Wounded war Vet Rocco Lampone, and the tough Luca Bracsi. <br /> <br />The Godfather starts in a 1945 New York.  A mob war is brewing between the Corleone's and a rival family.  The dilema of getting into drug trade and betrayal are at the heart of this literature classic. <br /> <br />The reason that the Godfather is so good is the depth of Mario Puzo's characters.  They aren't just evil criminals.  They are real people.  Puzo romanticises the mafia life and that time period altogether. <br /> <br />He also does something perfectly what other books have tried to do and miserably failed at.  He parodies real life characters into his novel.  Johny Fontane the saloon singer is his fictional Sinatra and it is perfectly done.   <br /> <br />This is easily ther best book you will ever read.  Also check out Puzo's other mob stories and Mark Winegardner's \\"The Godfather Returns\\" but only AFTER you read their inspiration, The Godfather.

B000002LND|1.0|The Immaculate Collection?  What an ironic name for this CD.  This CD is in no way \\"Immaculate\\".  \\"The $hitty Collection\\" would be a more appropriate title.  When I first heard that song \\"Material Girl\\" I thought the singer on the radio had a cold.  A few years later, I realized the truth--Madonna didn't have a cold when \\"Material Girl\\" was recorded--she just has a whiney voice.  I'm not just hopping on the anti-Madonna bandwagon here. As long as I can remember, I've always thought MAdonna was a lousy singer--a joke, really.  And it really is unfortunate that Madonna is singing these songs.  There ARE a few good hooks, but Madonna's nasal, whiney voice can make even well writtenn songs sound flat and boring.Don't waste your money on this CD.  Madonna is a singer based solely on image, and nothing more.  Thats why she had a 20 year long career.  She kept changing her image and coming up with new gimmiks.  And the brainwashed teenyboppers and music critics followed like a brainwashed cult.  No talent whatsoever.
B000056N8X|3.0|As an avid Higlander fan, I found \\"Endgame\\" choppy and superficial. I feel most sorry for Adrian Paul who gets my vote for the next James Bond and the ebst thing in the film. I hope this wasn't the way he wanted to close out the Duncan Macleod character, because it left me unfulfilled and if more is like this, I'm not certain I would like the taste. Now some Highlander devotees may wish to crucify me, more worse yet cut off my head, but the film is shoddy and disjointed. It asks the viewers to actually believe that Christopher Lambert hasn't aged at all in almost twenty years since the original 1985 film Highlander. \\"Endgame\\" never really needed him. Another thing the filmmakers missed out on was a potentially exciting explosive sub-plot between Duncan's current lover, Amanda (from the series), and his ex-wife (where was she during the series)Faith/Kate. It doesn't explain how Jacob Kell (overly acted by Bruce Payne) creates his team of minions who break the rules in order to kill other immortals. The fight scenes are impressively choreographed by Donnie Yen, but I would have liked a fight scene between Yen's character and Kell. The last fight simply recycles the same footage over again which I found to be a real disappointment. Paul is a fine actor with rugged good looks and a potential Sean Connery/Cary Grant-type charm and HIS talent is the only reason to purchase \\"Endgame\\".
B000002KOG|5.0|Neil was at the height of his powers when he wrote the songs on this CD. There are no klunkers here, every song has a strong melody and intriguing lyrics.<br /><br />I find this album compares favorably with the more famous Beach Boys or Beatles albums that came out at the same time. Like the Beach Boys and the Beatles, the rich melodies are the primary appeal of the album. Every song is good, though they are almost all sad, with lots of sweet, heartfelt chords and notes.<br /><br />The production of this album is a source of frequent comment. In my opinion, the CD is better mixed than the original vinyl. I'll have to confess however, that when I was listening to this album as a teenager, I had a poor stereo. It may simply be that the great sonic equipment we can buy now does justice to an album that couldn't be heard properly on a cheap stereo. Certainly it seems to me that Neil's voice is louder in this mix than the way I remember it from my youth. Also the songs seem to have more of an edge to them, so that the rockers come out with a bit more punch. Some of the instruments seem to stand out more clearly now.<br /><br />The melodies from this album are so strong that I would compare it favorably against many other good records from any point in rock history. However, you have to understand that this is Neil Young, and the album is moody, a bit introverted, even quite dark at times. But I listen to it for the lush production, the warm bittersweet chords, and the beautiful melodies. Plus, I like Neil's youthful melancholy. It rings true to me.

B00005NB8K|5.0|Well I see a few of these reviews, and the reviews from others saying that this movie doesn't show the real jim morrison. What Oliver Stone is trying to protray is his version of jim. oliver stone has said that he tried to get information on morrison from others that knew him, and all claimed that they knew the real jim. But their stories call conflicted, so what he did was take all of their stories and try to put together what he felt was jim. When your a fan of something you want your tribute to come out to be wonderful, but it's hard to please everyone. like on one review I read that crosby said that's not what jim was really like, but with everything that was going on in the sixties i'm sure that crosby barely knows what he was like. Now as for the film I thought the whole cast did a wonderfule job, and that's including meg ryan. Now this role was a totally stretch for meg ryan because she was know as america's sweetheart. She did a great job as pam because pam was really sweet, but she was also naive. I thought she really transformed herself on screen, plus her drug sceens were very real. I thought val kilmer was flawless as jim. I've been a long time fan of the doors because of their music, and also because jim morrison was a sagitarius, and I'm also one so I really understood where he was coming from. I thought this was one of oliver stone's best film, and that's from the acting to the casting to just the film as a whole.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|Boooooring! I can not believe how anyone could find this movie \\"fascinating\\" it's just plain boring! A bunch of middle-aged whiney incredibly wealthy drunks boo-hooing about needing to have \\"control\\" over their lives.What a bunch of crybabies! Who among us really has any control in their lives.These guys are considered Gods by their millions of fans and all they can do is sit around and piss and moan about their poor pathetic lives.Give me a break! No concert footage,no glimpses into their early years,almost nothing about their wives or girlfriends or kids, just a bunch of poor sound quality clips about making just the one \\"some kind of monster\\" song.And that song is not that good anyway.I lost a tremendous amount of respect for Metallica when they made that CD with all the orchestra music \\"S&M\\".What a waste of money that CD was as well as this DVD.
B000000WA2|5.0|I've had this album for quite awhile and I've never been able to really get into it, but when I listened to it the other day I realized that it was a really good album. \\"The Great Escape\\" has lots of good songs like Stereotypes, Country House, Charmless Man, etc, and very few poor songs on it. It is a little different from Parklife, though, it seems to be better musically, more diverse, and I find it more fun to listen to. <br /> <br />I recommend buying this with Parklife, and if you like what you hear, try Leisure, Modern Life is Rubbish, and Blur.
0316172324|4.0|This book is packed full of interesting stories, most of which adhere to the central theme - we have a second mode of thinking.  Mr. Gladwell forecefully argues for the relevance of recognising this \\"thin-slicing\\" mode, showing that it acts whether we choose to recognise it or not.  By the end of the book, you most likely will agree with him, and come away with a new understanding of what Oz is doing behind your own personal curtain.<br /><br />That said, some of the stories seem only somewhat relevant to the topic at hand and make the book seem more tangential, taking away focus from the central tenet.  Also, we're left at the end with an understanding that we have this new way of thinking, but little idea of what it implies to the larger world.  In the end, the book is a collection of compelling anecdotes, a few mind-jarring insights, and some boundless entheusiasm.  I recommend it - it'll make you think, in more ways than one.
B0006213WG|4.0|My friends told me about this cd and how I \\"had to get it\\". I've always thought of Sum 41 as being a wannabe punk band in the vein of Good Charlotte and Blink 182 but I was actually impressed by this album. <br />\\"Welcome to Hell\\" is an amazing punk song, but the whole album isn't punk, there's also some good just plain rock songs on here to complete the album. One of the songs has a really good guitar solo in it too... something I definately wouldn't expect from this band. <br />If you like \\"American Idiot\\" this album is a must-have, you'll like it as much or better than American Idiot.
B000099T3P|4.0|The Krites are the critters. They are nasty little hedgehog-type creatures and while they may look cute you wouldn't dare pet one as they'd rip your hand of and share the rest of you with their pals.<br /><br />The Krites are prisoners on an asteroid jailhouse floating through the far side of the galaxy. Chaos inevitably breaks out and the Krites escape in a stolen ship, heading for the nearest solar system and it's only inhabitable planet...earth! Not to worry though, a couple of intergalactic bounty hunters are soon on their tail and track them all the way to the quiet farming town of Grover's Bend, Kansas. The worst thing ever to happen in Grover's Bend is the local drunk (the ever lovable Charlie) getting chucked out of a bar. But now the Krites are here and they lay siege to the Brown farm, eating their cows, Billy Zane, chickens etc. Anyone or anything getting in their way is promptly poisoned by their anaesthetic spikes and feasted on.<br /><br />Once the bounty hunters arrive the almost do more harm than good. The bulk of the laughs come from this, including a running joke on how one of them has shape-shifted into the form of an '80s heavy metal rocker. The other can't make up his mind and constantly changes into various townsfolk.<br /><br />The Critters (8 small ones and a big shaggy one) may be Gremlins clones but there's no denying their cuteness. Though while I would love a pet Mogwai, I think I'll pass on a pet Krite.<br /><br />Critters is a mad comedy-horror with loads of imagination and the nerve to tell a truly offbeat story. Much like Stephen Herek's next movie (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) Critters succeeds on pure energy alone.<br /><br />The DVD has a murky-looking 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer (which is quite problematic considering how dark much of the film is) with remastered Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras are limited to 4 trailers and a (hidden) alternate ending, which I've yet to find. But for the price, you can't argue, and you gotta buy.

B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!\\", says a poem. But how much truth can we find there?. What if we could erase our bad memories of a romance gone sour?. Would we be happier, or would we just lose the benefit of experience, and the good memories along with the bad ones?. Of course, posing these questions seems far-fetched, so strange that many people wouldn't even think about it if it weren't for the fact that \\"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\\" brings to the fore the possibility of starting anew, and not in a metaphorical sense :)<br /><br />That is as a matter of fact exactly what Clementine (Kate Winslet) does on an impulse, after a particularly awful fight with her boyfriend, Joel (Jim Carrey). Afterwards, Joel doesn't understand why Clementine pretends not to know him, until he discovers she has had an operation to \\"erase\\" him. When he confronts the doctor who performed the operation, he decides to undergo the same procedure. But as the operation begins, and his memories start to fade, Joel begins to realize that he wants to remember his good moments with Clementine, even if that means keeping the bad ones too. As a result, he endeavors to hide his memories with her in parts of his brain that weren`t supposed to be wiped by the machine that the doctor manipulates. But will he succeed?.<br /><br />There are some secondary characters that are quite interesting, for example the unethical technician (Elijah Wood) that helps to wipe memories, and that starts dating Clementine after her operation. However, the best thing this movie offers is the great performances given by Carrey as an introspective and shy Joel, and Winslet as a loveable yet really eccentric woman who changes the colour of her hair to suit her whims. The director (Michel Gondry) and the scriptwriter (Charlie Kaufman) also made a wonderful job of showing us the dynamics of Joel and Clementine's relationship, and of making the spectator believe that what was happening was real...<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I loved this movie. The central themes are easy to relate to, because they have to do with feelings we all have experienced at some point in our lives: love, loss, anger, disappointment, the need to start all over again... \\"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\\" entertains you, but it also makes you think. It isn't a comedy, and it isn't a drama, but it is certainly the kind of film I can strongly recommend you to see....<br /><br />Belen Alcate spectator believe that what was happening was real...    On the whole, I can say that I loved this movie. The central themes are easy to relate to, because they have to do with feelings we all have experienced at some point in our lives: love, loss, anger, disappointment, the need to start all over again... \\"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\\" entertains you, but it also makes you think. It isn't a comedy, and it isn't a drama, but it is certainly the kind of film I can strongly recommend you to see....    Belen Alcat

B0001Z363W|5.0|Well i have been a BLS fan for just over a year and i recently bought this album before any others even though i usually prefer a heavier sound(mostly thrash metal) but I love all BLS so i thought id try it out. it was a good choice! this cd is amazing, the solos, the piano, the vocals, everything is flawless. <BR>My fav. tracks are &quot;crazy or high&quot; &quot;queen of sorrow&quot; &quot;steppin stone&quot; &quot;wont find it here&quot; damage is done&quot; and all of the songs actually, these are justr the ones that i find myself listening to the most. The entire cd is a rush of thought out, pretty mellow songs but the guitar solos are breathtaking especially on &quot;takillya&quot; and &quot;damage is done&quot;. this is my first acoustic cd ever and i am not dissapointed at all! this has become one of my favourites and is well worth the $15 i paid for it! do yourself a favour, go buy this cd!
B000059HAI|5.0|Tora Tora Tora\\" is a classic WWII film, and probably the most honest in its portrayal of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  It is the kind of film that gets shown in history classes in High School, which is where I saw it for the first time. The half-American/half-Japanese production is a shinning example of dedication to the facts over dramatic license when telling a historical story. The dual production shows heroes and incompetents on both sides of the conflict.<br /><br />While the proposed David Lean/Kurosawa Akira film never came to pass (And what a movie that would have been!), directors Kinji Fukasaku (\\"Battle Royale\\") and Richard Fleischer (\\"The Vikings\\") do their able best.  Fukasaku maintained the integrity of the Japanese side production, and it is almost shocking to see Japanese people acting like actual Japanese people in an American war film, rather than as stereotyped monsters or amusing caricatures.  He had little control over the final product, however, as all editing was done on the American side, and Fleischer simply removed any of the footage that he didn't like.<br /><br />The DVD for \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" is a real treat.  The new 20-minute documentary, \\"Day of Infamy,\\" discusses the historical accuracy of the film, with several University professors weighing in.  The commentary track is excellent, with a dialog between director Richard Fleisher & Japanese film historian Stuart Galbraith (\\"The Emperor and the Wolf.\\")  Kurosawa-expert Galbraith details the behind-the-scenes troubles with Kurosawa that led to his removal from the film, although, perhaps in respect to his commentary partner, he does not mention Kurosawa's dissatisfaction with the American director.  The commentary is much more involved with the filmmaking process itself, rather than the Pearl Harbor attack, and is a nice compliment to the more-focused documentary.
B0002BO0AS|2.0|first let me compliment these guys on their superior talent. every musician play incredibly, and unearth is probably one of the few bands that really cares about their music. but... <br /> <br />i don't see the appeal of \\"oncoming storm.\\" sure, they have some pretty catchy guitar riffs, and as i mentioned, every musician in this band is talented, but that doesn't mean that this is an instant classic.  <br /> <br />here, unearth are attempting to bring the gothenberg melodies into the mess that is metalcore, and to me, the end result isn't that spectacular. after the cd was over, i hardly noticed when one song ended and when a new one started, as every song pretty much sounds the same, only differences being a new catchy melody or a boring breakdown. <br /> <br />am i saying that unearth is horrible? no, the talent, passion, and intensity is all here, if unearth can change that into something really unique and fuse their own path, rather than rehashing their sound with each release, then i'll be the first to be their congratulating them.
B000268QB2|5.0|The music on this album is completely beautiful and poetic; it has leaves one with a wonderfully melancholy feeling not unlike the sadness that follows from being separated from the person you fell in love with. Although, this isn't the only theme. Other messages can be found in songs like \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" (about the simple bliss of being with the person you love), \\"Everybody's Changing\\" (about not wanting to follow a social mindsets), and \\"Sunshine\\" (about self-discovery). Of course, these are all my interpretations of the songs' meanings: you will necessarily have to find your own meaning.<br /><br />The piano and drums of all the songs is just beautifully composed and flows harmoniously, and Tom Chaplin's voice always comes out melodious: almost ethereal, never strained. Personally, my favorite songs are \\"This is the Last Time\\" (about completely losing oneself in love; beautiful singing), \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" (the music is especially beautiful), \\"Your Eyes Open\\" (about the loneliness of being cold in attitude), \\"Bend and Break\\" (about meeting a lover after death).<br /><br />None of the songs is too upbeat or party'esque. They all express a graceful poetry that is meaningful and deep. If you don't mind that, and you enjoy skilled singing, then you might want to buy this album.
0385510454|1.0|As a huge John Grisham fan, I have read virtually every one of his books.  I can easily say that this was not only my least favorite but it was really just a very poorly thought out book in general.  Nearly the entire book is character development for a character that never really does anything.  There is no direct conflict in this book, no \\"on the edge of your seat\\" suspense and most of it is about an ex-broker learning to speak Italian.  The book is written like Grisham just needed to release a book in 2005 like he does every year.  This one was planned very poorly
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I love this cd!  I'm proud to say that I had this cd before Gavin DeGraw really became \\"popular.\\"  I'm really glad that he is becoming so well known - he truly deserves it.  He has to give a good amount of credit to the WB, for introducing him on Pepsi Smash and then using his music on One Tree Hill and their other various shows. <br /> <br />On to the music.  I love Gavin's voice.  It's very raw and strong, and he really puts emotion into all the songs he wrote himself.  Some of my favorites are \\"Chariot,\\" \\"Just Friends,\\" and \\"I Don't Want to Be.\\"  \\"Meaning\\" has really pretty lyrics also.  But really, I love them all, except for \\"Chemical Party\\" which I skip every time - it just doesn't fit, and it's tacky anyways.  I'll give Gavin some slack though. <br /> <br />On the Stripped version, I love the piano intro to \\"Nice to Meet You Anyway.\\"  Stripped is a really great addition the first cd.  All songs are great, and have an extra element of rawness that makes it special.  It's Chariot, reinvented. <br /> <br />Buy this cd - you'll be glad you did!
B00001OH7U|5.0|You know, if you only had five CDs to take with you to the solitary island and all.  I won't even waste time mentioning the other four.  I've always been a somewhat passive Bowie fan.  The older stuff tends to get on my nerves; the later stuff (like Earthling) is so progressive that I have an intense admiration for the man, who could just kick back and rest on his immense wealth and release nothing but crap.  The \\"Berlin Trilogy\\" were the first three albums that I actively sought out b/c of the Fripp and Eno and Belew connections.<br /><br />Station to Station...  I just bought it today.  Knowing the fact that there are re-remastered re-releases of his stuff doesn't bother me with this album--  I've seek out and buy every other format this album is in to be able to compare every different nuance.  I don't care if I find a horribly scratchy second hand album in a dust bin somewhere.  Every song on this CD is a standout.  Golden Years has always kind of annoyed me, but in the context of the rest of this album, I've fallen in love with it.<br /><br />The title track here is reason enough to buy this album.  Do yourself a favor.  I love tracks that are long and take their time to evolve, and this song moves from a somewhat morose and cold beginning to an absolute all-out jam.  The bass if funky but static enough to keep the song grounded along with the kick butt drumming, and the twin guitar work is fabulous.<br /><br />I plan on forcing everyone I know to listen to this album.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|So many extreme death metal bands come out of nowhere with utter inability to play well. Poland's Behemoth is not one of those bands. Alongside fellow Polish natives and death metal veterans Vader and Vomitory, Behemoth is one of the leaders of today's international extreme death metal movement. My friend actually has this record (I don't own it myself, but plan on it.) I must say that it sounds considerably different when compared with their last effort, 2003's 'Zos Kia Cultus.' Highly recommended for fans of the afforementioned bands, as well as other Satanic extreme death metal like Krisiun, Deicide, and even the founders themselves, Possessed (RIP.) HAIL SATAN!
B00004THDI|2.0|Very nice music - nothing wrong with that. <br />But.... this is a stereo CD. It has SACD written all over it and my new Denon DVD-3910 DVD player does recognise this as an SACD, but it only has 2 channels, instead of 5.1. I do own several other SACD's and these DO play 5.1 channel. Very strange.... <br />So perhaps it's smarter to order the Stereo CD, the one with the special bonus tracks (Dances with Wolves (Special Extended Edition). <br />
B000002UC5|5.0|\\"McCartney\\" may seem off the cuff, but almost any other singer-songwriter would give anything to be able to write stuff this melodic. It's so warm, intimate, and tuneful -- the apparent ease with which Paul put this together was only possible because of his incredible talent. It's easy to underestimate this album because of his track record with the Beatles, but if anyone else had released this anytime between then and now, they'd be considered one of the greats. Of course, that's what this is...a great album, one of my all-time favorites.
0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown's thriller \\"Deception Point\\" does not take you around the world. It does however take you to the top of the world. In the middle of the American Presidential election campaign, which was heavily fought on NASA's fat and flamboyant budget - an amazing discovery is made. The President sends a team of independent experts to verify the authenticity and one of them: Rachel, is the opponent's daughter.<br /><br />Rachel and the other independent experts make a startling discovery which would cost them their life, well almost. She and two others escape and uncover the truth behind the discovery (the original discovery as well as the truth behind that).<br /><br />Dan Brown's narrative of the events has the markings of a best-seller. However, the turn of events towards the end is very dramatic and does not carry the \\"authenticity\\" it had in the beginning. The story is indeed thrilling, but it moves quickly to the top and tapers towards the end and the urgent need to end the story can be sensed at the end.<br /><br />I would have rated this book highly; however soon after completing this book I took up the author's other work - \\"Da Vinci Code\\" which was far more compelling.<br /><br />Rating: 3.6 / 5
B000002LIR|3.0|Rod Stewart is an amazingly long-lived chameleon with a proven ability to mine whatever is currently popular and strike gold. He's transformed himself many times over, from blues shouter to rock screamer to pop star to disco diva to jazz crooner.<br /><br />He's pretty much done it all -- and been lambasted by critics and purists both for \\"selling out.\\" There's some truth in their accusations, since the quality of his work has varied wildly over the years, as Rod himself will admit.<br /><br />But Stewart is also a talented musician and writer who can usually get to the heart of melodies and lyrics and express them vividly. I'm not much enamored of his latest foray into big band jazz, but his early and middle careers, as profiled on this retrospective, were full of fine moments. Don't be put off by the stories of his debauchery or by the song \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" As the title of this compilation reminds us, he's a storyteller, and the song is about a pair of desperate lovers, not him.<br /><br />Inspired by such soul greats as Sam Cooke and Otis Redding, Stewart started working with Jeff Beck and The Faces in the 60s, an interesting phase well-covered on Disc 1. Going solo, he charted again and again with the material on Discs 2 and 3, from classic albums like \\"Atlantic Crossing\\" and \\"Every Picture Tells a Story.\\" Disc 4 is lacking, but even here there are bright spots like \\"Infatuation\\" and \\"Downtown Train.\\"<br /><br />Rod contributes some witty commentary and embarrassing publicity shots in the accompanying booklet, which unfortunately omits details about when or where recordings were made, with whom he performed, or on which albums they were included. Given these omissions, and given that only about two CDs worth of really great stuff is included in this four-CD set, I can't give it more than three stars.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is so goofy. But by golly it is really good. I read some of the reviews discussing the values and the Buddhism in it. I totally agree because I know a little bit about eastern thought. <br /> <br />My special person and I have watched this together almost ten times since we got it. I can't believe this didn't get the oscar that year. Also, the fact that Courtney Love almost blocked the use of Teen Spirit is so interesting. This movie is like a criticism on my generation before many of us moved to California and became eastern.
B000002UAX|5.0|The One, the Only, The White Album.    Over and out  (The Professor recommends:  \\"Good Vibrations\\" by the Beach Boys)
0800141660|5.0|This movie is right on with the book. Although, there is one part in the book where Willougby explains to Elinor why he did what he did to Marianne, and I feel that it should also be in the movie. Other than that the actors and actresses do an absolutely wonderful job and portray the characters as I did in my head before I even saw the movie. Thank you Emma Thompson!
B000002J29|5.0|This baby deserves five stars just for the ending of \\"Supper's Ready\\" alone.  It may just be the best finish to any song I have ever heard, except for some to be found in classical music.  But there is so so much more that is great on this album.  It is the ultimate long road trip in a fast car album.  And the girls love it too.      This is amazingly profound music, even if some of the lyrics may be a little whimsical at times.  This is some of the most amazing live work I've ever heard, and the songs are almost all fantastic and I personally feel far better versions than the studio versions, though I can definitely appreciate anyone loving the studio work more.      Great stuff. Enjoy!    Over and out.    (The Professor recommends: \\"The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys\\" by Traffic; another perfect long road trip in a fast car song.)
B00004RFFS|4.0|How often is it that a movie (based on a book) is as beautifully told as in the original novel version? Not very often. Interview with the Vampire is one of my favorite books and I was very pleased to see that this film version maintained the book's impeccable story and elegance. Although some of the cast members were not portrayed as explained in the book (Armand particularly), I felt that overall the acting was outstanding (Kirsten Dunst as Claudia was phenomenal, as was Tom Cruise as the enchanting Lestat) and the plot was as fast paced and as compelling as the book. I would have liked to see the complex relationship of Louis and Claudia displayed in more detail, but overall I have to say that I was extremely pleased with the way that this movie portrays this magnificent, seductive (and sometimes erotic) story of the genuine charatcter of Louis the vampire. This film is absolutely recommended.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|im so glad that they finally released this on dvd.  it was my favorite show ever since i was a little one watching them new as they came out.  i dont understand how people can say the quality is bad.  its macgyver, not some high dollar movie production.  im tired of \\"digitally remastered\\" stuff coming out.  they ruined star wars that way.  i want to watch it as i remember it on tv, but without the commercials, and thats exactly what this does for me.  the price is great, especially since there are 21 episodes plus the pilot, unlike other tv series with shorter episodes, less episodes, with a higher price.  i cant wait till they release the other 6 seasons
B00005Y6YB|5.0|While the two DVD disks were wonderful, what happened to the rest of the story.  It does not end in Montana, but back in Lonsome Dove when Call brings Gus's body back.  How do we get that third disk and the rest of the story.  It seems that if you sell and ad a product, you should sell the complete story and not just part.
0312330529|5.0|This book is a must read! Lyrical and beautiful. It will make you laugh and cry. Highly recommended.
0786268379|2.0|If you enjoy strong punctuation opinions (not always good ones) interspersed with a few sad examples of bad writing--both the author's and other peoples'--this is a book for you. If you're looking for something dry and wry, keep moving.
B000002P5W|5.0|On an analytical level, Axis: Bold as Love was a landmark because Hendrix had mastered the art of using the recording studio as a musical instrument in itself. Techniques like flanging and backwards recording were new, but not unique to Axis: yet he took it to a level undreamed of.<br /><br />Hendrix' guitar playing was, needless to say, almost superhuman in its expressive ability.<br /><br />Beyond this, \\"Axis\\" is like a mythical magickal land I could visit at will. Just put on the headphones, press \\"play\\", and you were on a journey in a new world, and alternate universe where the commonplace was always a new experience, where the joy and anguish of life took on new dimensions, and where all possibilities and dreams were no longer out of reach.<br /><br />I reemember many times as a teen listening to this on headphones while my family slept. The onomatopoeic nature of Hendrix' guitar playing and music made the subject matter of his songs insinuate themselves in my psyche in such a way that it was as if I'd lived through these experiences. Few musicians have that kind of power.<br /><br />This is a special musical masterpiece.
0553275976|4.0|... this book has all the trappings of class while never surrendering its large-scale consumer appeal as \\"fiction.\\" BOTV has several dimensions - on one level, it's a satirical look at the dog-eat-dog world of upper-crust 1980s NYC, where power, greed and rabid statusmongering are the rule. Even if you just stay on that level, Bonfire is a great read - alternately very funny and sobering, though the prevailing dismal view of human nature may depress you. <br /> <br />On another level, BOTV has something to say about American society, human nature and, I think, the nature of desires themselves. Even the most hard-nosed conservative will wince at Wolfe's unrelentingly cynical view of black \\"civil rights leaders\\" who invariably turn out to be corrupt (interestingly, BOTV has not a single positive black character - unless you count Lamb, who's dead). And even liberals like me cringe at his description of made-for-TV \\"mass demonstrations\\" orchestrated by know-nothing urbanites. <br /> <br />Political sensibilities aside however, BOTV shows that even those who seem one-dimensionally \\"bad\\" to their antagonists often have at least a glimmer of decency. It's also a poignant commentary on what desires are real and which ones are products of the lives we lead; the hope for love versus the longing for exotic and dapper clothes, for instance. If you wanna think about it, this book can do us all a lot of good. <br /> <br />... and heck, if you don't, it's still a good way to kill some time.
B000002P5R|5.0|At last; Hendrix' final project was finished in a way that resembled his own vision.<br />His later music was clearly of a spiritual nature; which in restrospect, was inevitable. His earlier work more than hinted at it; as did the man's essential nature.<br />These songs are not new, although they remain \\"new\\" every time one listens to them. But apart from the well spoken of acomplishments Hendrix made by the time these were recorded, they remain an intregal part of our lives. These were the songs that helped define and lay the foundation for a uniquely American spirituality through musical experience.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Many people born before the anime era stereotype anime as senslessly violent and poorly written. Show them this masterpiece, and pretty soon they'll be watching it at 6:30 in the morning every Saturday, while you try to get some sleep. <br />I love this film because it shows that anime can still be very absorbing without unessecary violence, nudity, ect. The english  <br />dub REEKS of Disney (vile stuff, it is) , so make sure to watch it in Japanese w/ subtitles. The movie lacks info about the characters' origins (mostly Haku), but that's really the only flaw. The animation is smooth and crisp, the characthers have deep personalities, the monsters are hilarious (try to spot the Totaro in one of the beginning sequences) and the overall story combines many emotions as the main character quests to get home. <br />The soundtrack goes well with the movie (like how the jazzy soundtrack went well with Blue Submarine No.6), but may get repetitively annoying to some folks. As always, Hayao Miyazaki uses very innovative ideas, such as the main characther's parents getting transformed into pigs. Well, that sums it up. I would tell you more about it, but I won't give away too much of the plot. If you think this anime is bad and has a dull plot, go and watch Love Hana or Tenchi Muyo until your eyes can be mistaken for beach balls. Then you will know BAD!
B000002L7Y|3.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of you remember \\"Take On Me\\" and it's one of -if no the best music video ever, but \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\\" was a solid hit as well back in the winter of 1985/1986. \\"Hunting High and Low\\" was also a single that did decently in the spring of '86. So A-Ha is not a one-hit-wonder as many of you think.
0671015206|3.0|Before everyone kills me, let me say, I think this book is good. The only problem that I have with it is that it (and The Millionaire Mind) gets so bogged down with statistical information that I had a hard time finishing it. It is an interesting read in regards to the people that it is written about; the average drink beer from a can, own a small business, pay cash instead of finance, millionaires that people see everyday and don't realize it. It offers hope and a great perspective that financial intelligence and some will power goes along way towards long term security. I just felt that there was a lot of information overload in the text.
0446310786|4.0|I had to read this book in school and it was pretty good for an educational book. It had many adventures and exciting parts in it. It is about a woman named Scout who is in her thirties. She is narrarating her memories from when she was 6-10 years old. Some memories she talks about include how she and her brother Jem would always walk by the Radley house. They would sometimes find small presents in the knothole of the tree outside and they knew Boo (Arthur) Radley would come out a night to put them there. His brother Nathan wasn't supposed to let him out of the house and Boo had been locked up for the past 15 or so years (ever since he was 16). Another event that takes place is that Atticus, Scout and Jem's dad, is the lawyer representing a black man who has been accused of rape. Many people in the town are racist and don't think he should represent the case but he has to, to keep his moral value. This book takes place in the 1930's. The only reason why I didn't give this book five stars was that it isn't my type of genre, I don't really like historical fiction type stories, but other wise this book was very good!!
B00008IAMD|5.0|Tears streamed from my eyes in an unlikely emotional release the first time that I listened to this treasure from an artist whose \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"\\"I'll Walk The Line\\" had been etched in my memory long ago.  This unyielding tremulous soul filled wail of a gifted man consumed with joy, awe, some regrets and the sheer wonder of his life's path is truly a gift to savour. <br />   <br />Cash's rendition of \\"The First Time That Ever I Saw Your Face\\" will bring anyone who has ever had the good fortune to have loved deeply to the very brink of bliss.  His \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is expressive of a uncompromisingly sincere level of wizened, heart felt compassion.  \\"In My Life\\" will rip your heart out.   <br /> <br />The pathos of it all is heard here; yes, the human condition, the living in it, the dying, the passing and all of our changes. It's in these grooves with all of its fullness and \\"We'll Meet Again\\" and \\"Danny Boy\\" will simply leave you limp.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I know that a lot of people are posting reviews because they don't like Britney and her actions. Actions aside, she makes some of the catchiest pop music for pop music fans like myself. If you aren't a pop fan, I wouldn't suggest buying this, plain and simple. If you are a fan of pop music, then you should own this since Britney has practically defined our new era of pop music. <br /> <br />That being said, Britney has always been one of my favorite artists, and although I have a bias towards her, I think that this cd is great. The only issue I have with it is its lack of chronology, which would have made the listen a bit easier and more enjoyable, listening to Britney evolve as an artist. Since I am a fan, however, and own all of her cds, this isn't a tremendous issue, for I still love all of her songs and think that regardless of order they can still be enjoyed. Although I'm not sure if they randomly selected the song order or not. So here's my track by track review: <br /> <br />1. My Prerogative (7/10) - By far not my favorite Britney song. It's one of those songs that's great when I'm in the mood for it, but other than that I usually will pass on it.  <br /> <br />2. Toxic (9/10) - At first I liked this song, but never thought anything amazing about it. But then it was played everywhere and it really grew on me. Also one of her best videos. <br /> <br />3. I'm A Slave 4 U (10/10) - I loved this song the second I heard it. Stylistically it was a dramatic change for Britney, as she really created one of the most sexually entrancing songs ever. The irresistibly belly-dancing beat and the panting of her voice makes this song impossible to dislike. Absolutely love it. <br /> <br />4. Oops! I Did It Again (10/10) - Another song I yearned to hear when it first came out. I would sit in school singing the tune in my head, waiting to go home so I could listen to it; it's just so damn catchy! Really where Britney began her sexier era, yet in her still innocent way (no punintended). One of the best pop songs ever written. <br /> <br />5. Me Against The Music (8/10) - One of the things I don't get about the In The Zone album is this song. The album is terrific, but this song never really seemed on par with the others from that album. I think the only reason it was released as the first single was because Madonna was on it. When you're in the mood to dance, it's a great song, yet I feel it almost takes too long to pick up and to get into it. The song never really hooks you in and traps you there like many other of Britney's songs.  <br /> <br />6. Stronger (10/10) -  A great song from a great album. So catchy and poppy; uplifting. A great song to listen to when you're down, and also a great song to dance to.  <br /> <br />7. Everytime (10/10) - This song took a little while to grow on me, but it really has now. I find myself singing it for no reason in random places. The soft, playful background music really compliments Britney's high singing and gives the song a childish feel that we haven't really ever heard from Britney before. Sad song, but good nonetheless. <br /> <br />8. ...Baby One More Time (10/10) - This kinda ticked me off that they didn't put this song first; they could have really started the album out with a bang. Either way, this song is still amazing; one that I'm sure everyone knows. Has the catchiest chorus of any song I've ever heard. Honestly, it's no wonder America fell in love with this song from the start. This really is the perfect song for Britney and years later it's still just as fun and just as catchy. <br /> <br />9. (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix!) (10/10) - My favorite Britney song and video ever! I can't even tell you how stupendous this song is! She sounds so edgy in the beginning and the song just takes off from there; creating one of the best songs. Buy the greatest hits for this! (Among others) <br /> <br />10. Boys (Co-ed Remix) (9/10) - I don't know why but Boys really is a great song. Yet there's nothing that should be great about it. The original had a dark vibe to it, which carries through a little bit on the remix. Overall it has a great club feel and it's a great dance song. <br /> <br />11. Sometimes (10/10) - Another one of my favorite Britney songs. It has such a summer vibe and you can really hear Britney's singing prominently over the backup singers. A really cool, laid back, ride-along-to-in-your-car song. <br /> <br />12. Overprotected (Darkchild Remix) (8.5/10) - I couldn't decide between an 8 or a 9 so I gave it an 8.5. The original was a flawless pop song, but this remix is kind of boring. The beat repeats a lot and it doesn't really go with the vocals that well. They really should have gone with the original. If you can look past that, however, the song is still pretty good to dance to. <br /> <br />13. Lucky (9/10) - Really catchy and really good. Sounds similar to Oops and Stronger, but still a great pop song. <br /> <br />14. Outrageous (10/10) - This is where chronology is an issue. It sounds so weird to have Outrageous after Lucky, but once you get into the next song you get over it. The Arabian beat and sexy undertone give this song an interesting vibe, with some pretty bizarre lyrics that make the song really fun in a weird way. Playful and sexy. <br /> <br />15. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (10/10) - Probably my favorite Britney ballad. I wish she sang more songs like this because it really showcases some of her vocals and part of her range never really exposed in other songs. A really pretty sounding ballad also with a really pretty video, although I never would have went up on those cliffs like she did!  <br /> <br />16. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) (8/10) - The only reason it got an 8 was because I think the verses are kind of boring, but the chorus is great and extremely catchy. Not one of Britney's best, but still a welcome addition to this collection. <br /> <br />17. Do Somethin (10/10) - Wow. Just wow. This song issomething else. Stylistically so different, yet it works so well for Britney. The beat drives and the lyrics just make you wanna get up and dance. Kinda techo-poppy. If you're a Britney fan then you're gonna like this song. Such a great song! <br /> <br />So overall there are a few missteps, but with every collection you will get songs that are and aren't your favorites. Unlike some greates hits, this collection has a greater number of songs that I can listen to over and over again. It's too bad that they left off Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart, but perhaps they would have slowed down the collection, since Britney isn't really known for her ballads compared to her throbbing up-tempos.  <br /> <br />So, if you like pop music or are a Britney fan, get this cd, otherwise don't.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins is probably one of the few artists where people either really liked his music or really hate it. There is hardly any in between with him. Some think he was what took the band \\"Genesis\\" to new levels. Others think he ruined the art and progressive sound Peter Gabriel popularized when he took over the vocals and music writing from Gabriel for the band. Regardless, Collins has had a huge impact on the music industry, and has produced a ton of hits. \\"Hits\\" has some of the biggest, but then misses a few in the mix. <br /> <br />People are going to recognize these hits, because they still get plenty of radio time on adult contemporary stations and AOR stations. \\"Another Day in Paradise\\" and \\"Against All Odds\\" might be the two biggest hits by Collins (both number ones), but it's not even close to stopping. \\"Easy Lover\\", the popular duet with Earth, Wind, and Fires Phillip Bailey, is a pretty hard rocking number. \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\", and \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" illustrate Phils love for Motown-style R & B. \\"Take Me Home\\" is perfectly placed as the closing song (ironically, old \\"Genesis\\" bandmate Gabriel reunites with Phil to do the background vocals). \\"One More Night\\" is one of the top ballads of the 80's. \\"Sussudio\\" shows Phils ability to craft dance numbers. \\"In the Air Tonight\\" show Phil at his most dark, depressing, and haunting state with lyrics about his divorce. \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\" illustrates another love of Phils: the social message song. (Eric Claptons guitar on this one is beautiful). <br /> <br />There are also some new songs on this, but neither one really satisfies. \\"True Colors\\" is Collins trying to do justice on another cover, which he usually can accomplish, but just doesn't with this one. \\"Dance Into the Light\\" is a \\"Sussudio\\" style rehash, but it unfortunately falls short. It doesn't have the dynamics and beat like the former. <br /> <br />Also unfortunately some hits are M.I.A. \\"I Missed Again\\", \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", \\"Don't Lose My Number\\" and \\"Do You Remember\\" are all missing. Also missing are the popular Disney soundtrack songs (although I did just fine without them, I find them too cheesy and sugary.) Fans of \\"Genesis\\" will also have to go elsewhere, as no \\"Genesis\\" cuts are included in this collection. \\"Turn It On Again\\" is the best collection of Phil Collins era \\"Genesis\\" cuts. <br /> <br />\\"Hits\\" is a pretty good overview of the wide and prosperous career that Phil Collins has had. Love him or hate him, you can't deny the impact he has had on the music industry, and his power to stay on the radio after many years. <br /> <br />
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|vile, disgusting, trash. the bargain bin at Costco is too good for it. Nuff said.
B000002B1M|5.0|I remember 1996 for a lot of reasons. It was the year I left my beloved NYC. Tupac was killed (God Bless the dead, or MIA). And alot of rap videos were madd flashy. I swear everytime I turned on MTV or Rap City, I always ended up with a headache. Not to mention the crazy amounts of freaknik I heard down here in GA. Basiclly it seemed like the authenticness of 94 and before were done. But of course, in comes Nas. Building off of the sounds of Illmatic, with just a little more commercializm, Nas blends street poetry from the projects with the Gambino rhyme frame. Each track seems to tell a story, but the best ones were: <br /> <br />*The Message <br />*Street Dreams <br />*I Gave you Power <br />*Black Girl Lost <br />*Shootouts <br />*Live Nigga Rap feat. Mobb Deep <br />*IF I RULED THE WORLD feat. Lauryn Hill (BEST OF THE WHOLE CD) <br /> <br />One of the highlights from 96. If I Ruled the World explained the whole mindframe of a dude in the ghetto, or nowadays a black man or woman in America. The new sound is very different from Illmatic, but still classic East Coast. END.
B00005JMEW|2.0|What was Tarantino thinking? He stuffs all his favorite genres into a single movie mixing visuals, music, and styles from scene to scene. A washed out scene like a spaghetti western including the ripped off soundtrack. A campy chopsuey bloody fight scene. A stylish martial arts scene. Japanese anime - yes, Tarantino tosses in animation scenes. Film noir. A dash of campy Charlie's Angels. I'm sure I'm missing some. Add in a near record number of annoying flashbacks and you have a confused film one assumes is meant to be, at some level, satire but lacks any real humor, cleverness, or bite. Terribly sadistic in places, it generally is lacking in humanity. Uma Thurman is completely wasted though she tries awfully hard to breath life into an empty script. Oh, did I mention his fascination with spraying blood that gushes from wounds like an uncapped fire hydrant? Excessive is what this film's all about. This movies is only for Tarantino fans.
0894803123|5.0|I'd tried making ice cream in a hand cranked ice cream maker someone gave my fiance and I a while back. I thought the machine was faulty because the ice cream wasn't very good. Then I bought Ben and Jerry's book and I realized it wasn't the machine! All I'd needed was good recipes! Our favorite is the coffee one. It's so smooth and creamy and flavorful it puts my past favorites of Hagen Daz and Starbucks in the back seat. I wondered about the raw egg safety so I'm glad to read what another reviewer said about buying pasturized eggs. I feel like now I can serve this to my niece and nephews without a worry.
B00005JMUA|2.0|The good news with Kill Bill, Volume 2 is it isn't as mixed up as Volume 1. Tarantino took his critics to heart and cut back from Volume 1's habit of changing genres every other scene. Volume 2 also cut back a little on the annoying flashbacks. The bad news is, with the exception of a well done scene near the end (it's a twist so I won't give any more details), the film is quite dull. Other than Uma Thurman, you'll find better acting in a daytime soap opera. David Carradine who hides in the shadows of Volume 1 unfortunately is featured in Volume 2. The man can't act. And, judging from the one scene deleted from the movie (see bonus material), his action days are over as well. The cut fight scene he's in is an embarassment beyond the obvious attempt at humor in parodying bad Kung Fu movies. Mercifully, the spraying blood is gone but Tarantino's sadism is only mildly contained. I was so eager for this dog to end I fast-forwarded through most of the last 1/3 of the movie. Be careful if you do this though or you'll speed by the brief, disappointing showdown between The Bride and Bill in the end. Suffering through both volumes for a meager payoff is the final insult. This movie is for Tarantino diehard fans. There is a happy ending: no Kill Bill, Volume 3.

B0002G2B2M|5.0|'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' has earned the top slot on my shelf of DVD's after seeing it almost a year in March and completely falling in love with it. It is the most original and heart-warming romantic comedies I have ever seen in my life. The cast play out this saga absolutly beautiful portraying all the hearkbreak, humor and laughs that make this movie so unique. Kate Winslet as Clementine completely stole my heart and is what made this movie so great. I thinkeveryone woman as a little Clementine in them and can totally relate. Jim Carrey as Joel was absolutly amazing. I have never seen him act this way in anything and he just completely blew me away. The rest of the cast is not to be forgotten, adding their own spunk to each of their characters. <br /> <br />The whole idea of essentially telling the stories backwards was a very neat way of playing the story and also made it somewhat intriging. I wish more movies and writers could be as inspiring as Charlie Kauffman, because this movie is just absolutly amazing. I can't say enough about! It is just such a beautiful love story, I promise you will love it!!
0767834739|4.0|great movie it was fun'exciting'action pack'great story'this movie was hot and sexy.i heard they are making a squel to it called Resident Evil Afterlife i found abouth it on the web. but inny way see it you will love it.you will not be left down
0767834739|4.0|The R rating explanation at the beginning of the movie says it all:  \\"Rated R for non-stop violence.\\"  They got that right.  It is easy to see the PS2 video game elements in this movie.  It flows very well and I personally enjoyed this sequel more than the original.  The addition of Jill Valentine to the mix was an inspiration.  To tell you the truth, she's hotter than Milla.<br /><br />In this episode, the contagion has broken out in Raccoon City and the population immediately falls victim.  Umbrella Corp isolates the city and ultimately unleashes Alice, who has become a project in and of herself since the last outing.  Umbrella takes advantage of the situation and unleashes Nemesis into the city for a trial run.  Ultimately, he is pitted against Alice.  There is a surprise at the outcome of that match.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr. Ashby wants Alice and company to locate his daughter who was in the process of being evacuated when hell broke lose.  In exchange, he promises to get them safely out of the Raccoon City.<br /><br />There is a lot more characterization here than in many horror films.  RE is very imaginative and the movie makes use of the rich history created by the game.  Good entertainment for the horror fan.
0440178002|5.0|This book has been reviewed and re-reviewed so many times on this site, that I will not trouble you with another rehashed plot synopsis or analysis of the characters.  Instead, I give you my core impressions of the novel.    Shogun, in all of its titanic 1100+ page glory, humbles the reader with its sheer grace and majesty.  Clavell crafts his characters in painstaking, loving completeness, and is just as attentive to the plot and finer nuances of the book.  You will fall in love with the characters, exult in their triumphs and cry for their failings.  It is a story about love and honor and loyalty and doubt and searching and a hundred thousand other human passions.    Clavell posesses a gift for bringing foreign cultures and places alive with vivid, piercing reality.  You will feel the cold bite of steel, smell the sea air off of Osaka, see the radiant, red dawn before a battle, and cherish the brilliant world that Clavell has woven together so perfectly.  This book is perhaps the most real work I have ever read.  Every sense is catered to, every emotion played upon, every passion and horror felt with stunning truth.    I can think of no greater praise than to say this:  You will lose yourself in this book, completely.  And you certainly won't mind.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Everything has been said about this man already and yet it will never all be said about him. Everyone I've had listen to Jaco is immediately astounded, even though this album is nearly 30 years old (older than Jaco was at the recording session). It never gets stale and it even reaches out to my own young boys of 10 and 12. Jaco should be entered into the music history dictionaries along with other great virtuosos. <br /> <br />This debut album is certainly a must and should not be missed from anyone's collection, no matter what your taste in music. <br /> <br />Good follow-up is to read about his life and family through the family website(s), the biography written about him and to explore his other work with Weather Report, Joni Mitchell, Pat Mathaney, etc...
B00003CXDD|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a little boy. Probably no older than at least 6 or 7 and I remember falling in love with it then. My friend Amy has bought the DVD and she let me borrow it over this weekend. I fell in love with the movie all over again. I found myself laughing, smiling, just generally being happy as I watched this movie from my childhood all over again. It is such a great, heartwarming movie, filled with action, adventure, and humor that just makes you laugh out loud. I reccomend this movie to just about anyone, I don't think you even need to be a fantasy fan to love this movie.
B0000696I0|5.0|Great stuff.  Very funny and violent in a harmless kind of way.  Ernie Reyes Jr. was on his way to becoming an action star for the younger set with this film, unfortunately, he ran smack into the movie \\"Surf Ninjas\\" and ruined his film career, but I still saw him years afterward as a judge on beauty contests. What a good kid film can get you into nowadays. Anyway, this film takes the Turtles back into the vague illusion of the genre which was the genesis of this story in the first place, science fiction.  We find more of the glowing ooze and what it does if  consumed by Shredder. Also of great note is the cameo by Vanilla Ice as the club performer.  Although he was never really cool to me I think his cameo in this film is the thing of genius because he's just so odd of a man.  He did have charisma back then and he doesn't now because he lied to us about his being raised in a harsh environment.  In reality, he was so popular back then that he probably wouldn't be playing at a small club, he'd be playing arenas, but that's not as alluring, or immediate as a small basement club that the Turtles happen to crash into while being pursued by the foot squad.  What he ends up rapping isn't great in retrospect, nothing he's ever done, or will do, will ever be that good, but all my friends that went to see it wanted to talk about was that rap, it was simple, dancable, and set to the club atmosphere which I had never experienced before.  Ultimately, the movie is just as odd in an attempt to be more bloodlessly violent, funny, and over the top than the previous film.  What it ends up skipping out on is the human story which makes the first film better, in my opinion. The Turtles are so entertaining because they are more than human, but it's no surprise that they resemble a human scientific genius, hothead,standup comedian, and jock-like captain. It's when the Turtles are in contrast to people that they shine the most and they seem to do less of in this film while still remainingentertaining.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Why does everyone care what they listen to? \\"It's not goth\\", \\"that's not punk\\", \\"what do they think they are, they're not country\\". All this stuff about not being true goth, punk, country, rock, pop, etc. is all stupid, IT DOESN'T MATTER, QUIT CARING IF IT'S THE REAL STUFF OR NOT! JUST AS LONG AS IT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME!!! So instead of wasting your time and breathe by being picky if it's true this or true that, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT SOUNDS GOOD TO YOU!  <br />By the way, I think Avril Lavigne is the co0lest!
B0000696I1|2.0|This is a bad movie not only because it doesn't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content.  It's like this film attempts to create Turtles psychaitry 101.  Each turtle attempts to work on and/or completely vanquish their weaknesses.  Leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja, Mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter, Raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children, and I believe that Donny falls in love.  It's been awhile since I've seen this film so I may have that last thing wrong. More than ten years have passed since I saw this stinker and although I don't remember every minute detail the problems that I had with it are enormous.  First, the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci-fi. The television series and films haven't really gleamed upon that aspect, instead relying on action, humor, and pseudo wisdom from Splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product.  In my opinion the separate storylines of the Turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot. In particular, Leo's and Raphael's storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in. The pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments. They just feel heavy handed.  That's not to say Mikey's plotline isn't just as bad, but he's allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute, but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all. <br />Secondly, the action is just not there as it was before. Sure, it's still pretty bloodless, but the scenes are few and far between and boring. The Turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it's previous effects of catharsis.  It felt like I was watching the History Channel special about the history of the Turtles war in Japan and they lost.  Also, the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a Warner Brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles. Having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too. I'm just the kind of guy who likes(in these kinds of movies) the bad guys to get a death that you don't have to see, or feel the impact of because you can't imagine when their end comes, like falling down a bottomless pit. To me, bombs are out of the question in terms of death. <br />Thirdly, the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny. An example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following, or running from bad guys and they're going up stairs, lots of stairs and Mikey goes, \\"This is good for my calfs,\\" I was thinking, \\"What, is my mom supposed to laugh at that?\\"  As for the Japanese men who take to American living all too well, none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now, it's like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk, painfully unfunny and pointless.   <br />Equally as pointless was the use of Casey Jones.  His character in the first movie almost steals the show at times, but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the Japanese men. In a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles, forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines.  In this story the writers would have Casey Jones completely emasculated, possibly for laughs, possibly for moral. The former is definitely not the case, the latter is underdeveloped. It's like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight, that's what we're thinking for a majorityof the film.  In retrospect, the Japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless.  So he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from Splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series.  I admit, it's a good idea but way too heavy handed.  The meaning is always better in small doses.  <br />FINALLY, the song used in the film toward the end with the Japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting. It was used to great effect in the TV spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting, funny, action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film. Oh well, at least found out the name of that song.
B00006JJ51|5.0|This started gangsta, this defines gangsta, this is GANGSTA! Straight Outta Compton is a west coast classic. I know they weren't the first because Schooly D used gangsta in his stuff before them. If the FBI hates their song \\"f*ck tha Police\\" it must be good. The title track is my favorite and \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\" is another dope track.<br /><br />Apart from the first 3 there is other dope songs like \\"8 Ball(remix)\\" \\"Express Yourself\\" where Dr Dre makes his first rappin appearance here on this album. Also check \\"If It aint ruff\\" and \\"Compton's n the house\\"<br /><br />The only one I dont like here is \\"I aint tha 1\\" and i aint 2 mad on \\"Sumthin 2 dance 2\\"<br /><br />Overall this is 10/10 and buy it if u like GANGSTA  im mean real gangsta not fake wanabe gangsta like 50 and Ja.<br /><br />and thats all I have to say about that
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The album Thirteenth Step is a marvel to behold, and its one of the few albums I can't seem to take out of my playlist after years of listening. That seems to oversimplify the dilemma in the experience too, because the disc has been pumping into my audio veins for so long that it feels like it's become a part of my disc changer subconscious, and I still love it. In fact, I've nicknamed it \\"#45\\" because that slot has become the place it haunts whenever it and my discman need one another.<br /><br />I've wanted to review the album quite a few times since I purchased it, actually picking the work up on several occasions and attempting to hammer out something that captured it, but I've found myself sitting the album back down in frustration and putting off an attempt at verbalization because its really hard to descriptively sample. And, really, how does one capture the essence of an album that seems to contain a little taste of \\"soul\\" in the lyrics? Is calling something \\"Audio ambience lighting the paths and subsequent pathos that showcase the beauty need and neurosis can birth\\" really explaining a marvel? Is saying the work is \\"genre-defying\\" really covering any ground and getting one closer to \\"you really should buy this work\\" without doing the piece a disservice? I'm not sure how to capture the album even now, truth be told, but I will attempt to break down a couple of its achievements to say why it merits high praise for me.<br /><br />First and foremost on the list, I have to say that Thirteenth Step is a testament to the power of a human voice. I've heard so many people try to sing in my life that its hard to say that any of them are \\"moving\\" anymore, but I have to say that Maynard can be breathtaking when it wants to be. In fact, when listening to the harmonics within Maynard's vocal precision, it becomes apparent that the man has talent. He doesn't have to hit you like a hammer with his voice to make a point, and he never tries to overpower you when he pours you an emotive soliloquy and asks you to sip it for a while. Most of the time he's more like a shadow that slowly comes to rest on your shoulders, with you finding yourself slowly immersed in the vibrance and beauty that the voice projects. It's empowering when I think of how Maynard does what he does, changing his sound depending on the song and becoming an instrument unto himself, and how he can birth atmosphere simply by formulating syllables that most voices emit like waste.<br /><br />Next, there's the issue of content driving the songs themselves and how they manage to impact. I'm not really a fan of oversimplified music, not enjoying what mundane hymns brings to the game lyrically, and have to say that this is another reason I enjoy Thirteenth Step so much. Its one of those works that lets the wording worm its way into one's emotive inner eye, relating both situational experimentation and crescendos of feelings all in one stroke, and it does so by letting the backdrop cast so many emotions in the length of a album. Some tracks become dark overtures camouflaged in pretty packages that seem to denote what monsters we can become, some are mediums of pain and perhaps love - depending on how you define the artifice of the heart, and others simply writhe with anger or limp across the stage like a broken child's lullaby. And I like that; the diversity in it AND the fact that it tastes real.<br /><br />In you want highlights from the album (and these, by no means, are meant to overshadow the other tracks on the album), I'd go with The Noose, Blue, A Stranger, The Nurse that Loved Me, the heaviest track on the album - Pet, and Gravity. I'd also say that you should relax when listening and give yourself to the sounds, because immersion is the beauty within the process.s you an emotive soliloquy and asks you to sip it for a while.

0151008787|5.0|Oz calls himself a 'word child' from the earliest of times. His love of language and his ability to use it in such lyrical and striking terms, is what sets Oz apart from many good writers today. A Tale of Love and Darkness is a magical book, one which recount's Oz's story from the eyes of a child growing up in Palestine, when was a young child of 8 or 9 years old. Oz moves backwards and forwards telling his story, which appears to be non-fiction, (about his own life and that of Israel,)but could very well have elements of a beautiful fairy tale and fiction as he discusses what life was like growing up in Palestine and then Israel of from the late 1940s. In his early life, he dealt with the suicide of his mother, and its impact on his relationship with his father, himself and his country. <br /> <br />My only regret is that I could not read this amazing book in its original language of Hebrew. Being a lover of words myself, there are probably even deeper and more mystical layers of meaning in the original language of this great writer.
B00006SF8H|3.0|This is a good album, as you can see from reviews for the European and American releases.  This one has a bonus track that's part of the concept and I think really belongs on the album.  Amazon, fix your track names...'Walking every God'..'Chain Song'..'Rope Ending'...Somehow I don't think the japanese release mistranslated the titles this poorly. I mean, come on.  Anyway, the import's worth getting instead of the other version because the bonus track is great.
B000001GQB|4.0|I had previously heard Karajan's version of these symphonies, which are still my favorite. I had also heard of Karl Bohm being the 'definitive' Mozart interpreter and so got this CD. Not as heavy as I would have hoped, but refined and 'classical' in its own way. Tempos are rather moderate throughout, not a bad thing at all. I especially like the Presto of the 'Linz.' The 39th is another outstanding performance. <br />The sound quality is very nice, although some parts aren't mixed that well. In the first movement of 'Haffner,' for example, during the second time the key moves to A, a solo violin is heard where the violin section should be. In the Presto of 'Linz,' towards the end, the high Cs seem to be drowned out by the lower instruments. Perhaps I am just used to Karajan's production. Still, this is one of my favorite CDs in my collection; how can you possibly go wrong with Mozart's late symphonies, these greatest of all artistic achievements, done under the helm of a more than competent conductor? <br />Buy this, and Karajan's version too!
B00065JTBA|4.0|There's something to be said about unreleased songs: most of them are unreleased for a reason.  Yeah, you'll find a random gem here or there but, in the end, most bands put the really viable stuff on their records and they know there's something peculiar or missing from the songs that don't make it. <br /> <br />Case in point are most of the songs found in Bon Jovi's boxed set.  There's some likeable stuff, sure.  There's some stuff that you can't figure out how it didn't make a record compared to whatever least favorite song you might have on various records of theirs. <br /> <br />In the end, though, most of these songs are missing that magic that makes a good song great.  They're interesting pieces of a puzzle, interesting insight into the band's creative process but I rarely found myself thinking I was finding lost classics here, just songs that for whatever reason didn't have 'it' and probably shouldn't have been on whatever record they were intended for. <br /> <br />That's not to say this isn't an enjoyable boxed set.  It is.  But I think it might have more interest for people intrigued by the creative process, more than it's just fifty more great Bon Jovi songs.   <br /> <br />Bon Jovi is a band that seems willing to admit that they don't always get it right the first time.  This boxed set shows how close they sometimes come.
B0006J28L4|4.0|I admit that I never thought much of Denzel Washington until I saw him in \\"Training Day\\".  In that movie, I was very impressed with his ability to play a very  confident, smart, and super-cool character.   He deserved that Oscar.  Now, watching \\"Malcom X\\", a movie made by Spike Lee in 1992, I realize that he has always been that kind of actor.   His portrayal of Malcolm is full of power and subtlety.  I've never had that much interest in Spike Lee's films, but I have to say that this one is very well done, and very interesting, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.
B000096I9G|5.0|This is by far my favorite possession in regards to The Cure, and just Robert smith in general. I believe everything is perfect down to the encores. This is the perfect gift for people who are \\"huge cure fans\\", like myself. This was a gift from my brother at Christmas. When, I opened it I almost cried. this has been the best Christmas gift ever, from anyone.  <br />
B00076ZZ84|5.0|Don't listen to the other person I bought this and I put it in my DVD player and it is surround. it really good if u haven't bought the CD if you have then just skip it.
B000002B5L|5.0|Simply put, \\"The Score\\" is the definition of a perfect hip-hop album. The beats are funky (\\"Fu-Gee-La\\"), soulful (\\"Ready or Not\\"), hardcore (\\"Manifest\\"), and occasionally jazzy (\\"The Mask\\") and resemble production found on other hip-hop classics such as ATCQ's \\"Beats, Rhymes, and Life\\" or OutKast's \\"ATLiens\\". On the rhyme tip, Lauryn Hill boasts verses that rival hip-hop's top emcees (Gift of Gab or Common, for example) on \\"Zealots\\" and \\"Family Business,\\" while Wyclef drops a distinctly cynical, afocentric steez (\\"No Woman, No Cry\\" and \\"The Beast\\"). Quite wisely, Pras's mic time is kept to a minimum, which, as the least-skilled emcee in the trio, allows him to stay on topic. Collectively the group tackle an array of social issues ranging from police brutality (\\"The Beast\\") to gun control (\\"Cowboys\\") to homelessness (\\"Mista, Mista\\") to mid-90's political staples such as the Oklahama Bombings and Newt Gingrich. The two re-makes on the LP, \\"Killing Me Softly\\" and \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" are beautiful masterpieces that only complement their originals and catapult \\"The Score\\" into greatness; with \\"Killing\\" in particular being one of the most magical songs ever covered. This one's a no-brainer: Cop \\"The Score\\" immediately, you won't be disappointed.
B000099T2L|2.0|Now, I'm a fan of Destiny's Child(or I used to be before the disaster that is Destiny Fulfilled). I like Beyonce's voice and there is NO doubt that the girl has a magnificent set of pipes. But, this album just didn't shine to me. I didn't buy it because CRAZY IN LOVE didn't quite appeal to me. My mother bought it and burned me a copy. I listened to it and thought that some of the tracks were a bit cliche. She's a good songwriter, but much of it sounds repetitive. <br /> <br />Standout Tracks: <br />NAUGHTY GIRL...9/10 <br />BABY BOY F/SEAN PAUL...10/10 <br />BE WITH YOU...7/10 <br />ME, MYSELF, AND I...10/10 <br />DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE 2...10/10 (This is the EXACT same song as on DC's \\"Survivor.\\" The ONLY difference is that instead of the guitar, there is a piano. I always thought Beyonce sung that song on DC's cd by herself, but now I know it's true). <br />BONUS TRACK: LIKE MY DADDY...10/10 <br /> <br />Bad Tracks: <br />HIP HOP STAR F/BIG BOI AND SLEEPY BROWN...4/10 <br />YES...2/10 <br />THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU DUET W/LUTHER VANDROSS...2/10 (It was pretty, but it goes on FOREVER and after a while, it gets annoying) <br />SPEECHLESS...4/10 <br />THAT'S HOW YOU LIKE IT F/JAY-Z...3/10 <br />SIGNS F/MISSY ELLIOT...1/10 (Entirely too cliche) <br />GIFT FROM VIRGO...0/10 (By now, we realize that she's a Virgo. She sure flaunts it enough. Annoying vocals and obviously filler.) <br /> <br />So, it's not a completely bad album, but it isn't great and it certainly wasn't worth 5 Grammys. I pleasantly surprised that it was this bad and pleasantly surprised that she won those Grammys for it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|While no-one should call this DVD, or the movie in general, pleasant, it is the only movie that I can think of that *should* aim for an R rating.  The Passion of the Christ is not fun to watch, but it brought home to me in a whole new way how very badly Christ was treated for our sakes. <br /> <br />As a Catholic, this seemed to me to be a very Catholic protrayal.  If you are not Catholic, however, this should not put you off.  Whether Moslem, Protestant, Catholic, atheist, or agnostic, everyone should see this film.  I say this not because I believe it will convert you, but because it is a stunning portrayal of ultimate love.  It is clear in the faces of both Jesus and Mary that this film, however brutal, is truly about love. <br /> <br />In sum, this is my advice:  Buy the DVD.  Watch it once.  Put it away for a while, then watch it again.  Don't watch it too often, but watch it.  I truly believe that you will know what I mean here once you have watched it just once.
B000683VI4|3.0|There are certain parts of this movie I love. Like every single part with Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. I've read a lot of praise for the scenes (which cut in during the teenageer stuff) in which an older man is reading a love story to a senile  woman. True, the sweetness and the tenderness between James Garner and Gena Rowlands is undeniable, but I think it takes away from the story. I don't care how the book goes. I haven't read it. To me that's not important. I'm judging a movie, not how well the movie sticks with the book.  <br /> <br />It's a classic love story. Boy gets girl... you know the formula. Noah (Gosling) sees Ally (McAdams) at the fair and asks her out. She says no, then hops on the ferris wheel with another guy that doesn't even compare to Noah. Noah is crazy in love at first sight and jumps onto the ferris wheel, mid-motion, and dangles hundreds of feet in the air until she agrees to a date. Their love is everything that everyone wishes they had. They fight, they make up. Most importantly, they have passion, and  man oh man does that show on screen between Gosling and McAdams. I don't think I've ever seen such amazing chemistry. Her parents, of course, don't approve. This boy doesn't make enough money. This boy isn't good enough for you. Blah blah blah. So her parents immediately move when they realize their daughter is TOO in love. Noah still loves her and writes her a letter everyday for a year, which, of course, she doesn't get because mommy dearest hides them. Years go by. Ally is engaged to another man, but still thinks of Noah. What's a girl to do? She gets in her car and goes to see him, pretending like she's utterly happy with her new guy and her new life. But that passion between them is still there. <br /> <br />There's lots of little bits to this movie so it's hard to describe in such a short space. Does everything work out? Well, sort of. I suppose it does, but I guess it really depends on how you look at. The ending is so sappy thatI could've sworn someone just dumped honey over my head. I know this movie could've been done a lot more gracefully. There's a thin line between sweet and melodramatic and this movie jumps that line right into the dead center of melodrama. Ick. Okay, okay. I did like the movie. But I'd be lying if I said there weren't things that definitely could be changed. I do recommend this movie. Rent it before you buy it, though. It'd be a great Valentine's gift. Or just a nice anytime gift for your sweetie. A gift that says, \\"Let's die together.\\" Lovely. Really lovely. No, I mean it. It would make a great gift. 3 and 1/2 STARS... 3 is too low and 4 is too high!! RECOMMENDED!!
068987474X|5.0|Thank you for your honesty, for your bluntness, for telling us the truth. <br />    I heard a guy say the other day that he hated this book, because he was afraid that the girls he dated or wanted to date might read it, and discover all his tricks and BS.  <br />    If you are a girl and dating, or wanting to date, RUN to get this book.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|As I said, \\"the best western ever made\\" and one of the best films, period!   <br /> <br />No more need be said, this is a fabulous film.  If you've never seen it, do yourself a tremendous favor.
B000089CJI|5.0|When i first bought this CD i was a little concerend, i didnt know what to expect, i heard a couple songs and they were great but i didnt like the fact that there are no insturments. Anyways i bought the CD and LOVED it every single song is good. I have had the cd for a while now and can listen to it over and over i recommend this CD for anyone whos looking for relaxing good music
B0006399FS|1.0|I wish the aforementioned atomic bomb was remantled and aimed directly at U2.The bilingual lyrics in the beginning of Vertigo could be no more pointless and innane than what I had for dinner two years ago.Being berated with obviously \\"well-thought out\\" lyrics like \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...\\" at the end of their most \\"promising\\" track, makes me envision Bono hard at work at a desk some where writing down this lyrical garbage.Other than the truly overplayed, over-rated, and over done Vertigo, which needed to be truly lampooned, the other songs are literally not worth my most wasted minute.Please for the continuing sake of all types of music I beg of any reader; Do Not Buy This Trash!
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is a frothy frivolous chick flick that makes no pretence at being anything else and is all the better for it.<br /><br />The story centres around rich, sorority girl Elle Woods (played so well by Reece Witherspoon) who, after being dumped by her wealthy boyfriend Warner, decides to enrol in Harvard law school (where he has gone) in order to win him back.<br /><br />Elle arrives at Harvard as a vision in pink (her signature colour) and accompanied by her beloved Chihuahua, Bruiser Woods, to the disbelief of the other students....as one says, open mouthed, \\"it's Malibu Barbie!\\".<br /><br />Elle faces an uphill struggle to prove she is not a dumb blonde but deserving of her place and also has a fight on her hands to win back Warner who has got himself engaged to a prissy New England girl (Selma Blair). The movie is formulaic and holds no surprises but it doesn't matter as it is such good fun and it's great to see the loveable Elle win out...especially when she realises she doesn't need the creep she wanted back but that she has made it on her own. Sit with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy.
B00012QM9K|1.0|I am extremly dissappointed by amazon. <br />Im from Germany and ordered this Box few days ago. <br />I got the Gift Set today and the case was damaged. <br />Amazon should use better packaging for Items like that when they send it to Europe. <br /> <br />I hope i will get a replacement for that. <br /> <br />Movie 5 Stars <br />Amazon & Packaging no Stars
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It's Napoleon's world and we're just living in it.  From the brilliant opening credits by the legendary 70-year-old title designer Pedro Ferro (\\"Dr. Strangelove, Stop Making Sense, Men in Black\\") to the ending disco beat of \\"The Promise\\" by 'When in Rome', Jared Hess constructs a true-to-life vision of his hometown Preston, Idaho that had me rolling in on the floor, falling in love with characters that I would never go near in real life. Jon Heder (who is clearly too old to play the title character) lets nothing stand in his way of creating the ultimate nerd. With Pedro at his side (Efren Ramirez) the two get mocked, humiliated and asswhupped until the final amazing cathartic ending that shows the small joys of friendship and affection. Jon Gries (from 'Get Shorty') as Uncle Rico is a scream as over the hill jock and coniving tupperware salesman. DVD transfer is quite good and the deleted scenes are awesome.  Commentary by the director and Heder however make you realize how young these guys are.  I knew something was up when Dennis Quaid showed up on the Daily Show wearing a \\"Vote 4 Pedro\\" t-shirt. Let Napoleon take over the world.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Despite the fact that I loved the CBS Television treatment of The Incredible Hulk, even as a child I referred to the show as &quot;watered-down HULK&quot;.The Hulk in the comics was described by Stan Lee, (his creator), as: &quot;1000 lbs of unfettered fury, the mightest mortal to ever walk the earth . . .&quot;. In the comic books, Hulk could leap 1/4 mile, run 60-80 mph, and easily use a tank as a bat to swat another tank! This is the Hulk I longed to see on the BIG Screen, and this is the Hulk that was presented! In the comics, Hulk's main enemy (at first) was the United States Army. This was also the case in the film. Although the movie was slow moving, I enjoyed it the first time I saw it. Interestingly enough, the more I watch the film, the more I increasingly enjoy it! In the comics, Hulk gets stronger the angrier he gets! In the film, he gets bigger, an interesting choice but still true to the original concept. When I saw the teaser trailer for the Hulk, (at the first showing of Spiderman), I did not even know it was for the Hulk but I instantly associated Eric Bana as Dr. Bruce Banner before the mirror close-up! I thought his performance of Banner was absolutely on point. I did not have any problems with the special-effects at all, I thought they were excellent. I did subtract one star because the ending with his father was a bit muddled. The thing that gets me about some of the criticisms is that Hulk was CGI as opposed to an actor. If you pick up ANY Hulk comic, you can plainly see that Hulk cannot be accurately portrayed without GIANT proportions! I would have been disgusted if the used an actor in green paint!!! The story of the Hulk is a Dr.Jekyl/Mr. Hyde monster tale first, and a misunderstood superhero second.
0385510454|2.0|While Grisham's latest wasn't bad enough to give up on, he has  hit an all-time low with The Broker. The plot (if you want to call the weak, loosely connected story line a plot) is poorly developed, the characters have no depth to them, and the ending (as well as most of the rest of the book) is boring. Rather than being (supposedly) a suspense thriller, The Broker reads more like an historical travelogue of Bologna, Italy and a Berlitz course on learning Italian, which is fairly interesting and the only reason I am not giving this book a 1-star rating. I've read and enjoyed to varying degrees virtually all of Grisham's books, even those that were heavily panned by many reader reviewers. However, The Broker is an almost complete waste of valuable reading time. It seems clear from the ending of The Broker that Grisham has a sequel in mind. Next time, he won't have me (and my money) to support him. Do yourself a major favor and skip this book.
078401115X|5.0|Mickey Rouke stars as Private Eye Harry Angel who is given a job by the mysterious Louis Cypher (Robert de Niro). His remit is to find missing singer Johnny Favourite. Unfortunately for Harry the people he is investigating for the job have a habit of being found dead after he has talked to them. Naturally this puts Harry in the frame for murder.<br />The cinematography is first rate. Filmed for the most part in Louisiana, there is a real sense of oppression and gloom that makes for an uneasy atmosphere throughout and certainly adds to the tone of the film. Rouke is excellent as the deadbeat Harry a character that attracts and repels at the same time whilst De Niro is suitable sinister as Cypher.<br />Alan Parker has produced a film that is part psychological thriller, part occult-horror, but always gripping.
068987474X|5.0|I bought this book about a week after it came out. Makes perfect sense as hard as it was to swallow. Yes, those guys who are into you do call within 48 hours. Based upon my experience they do make every effort to find you. I found myself picking up the book again when I had a date and he said he would call me later in the week he had a \\"really busy week\\" Well it got closer to the end of the week and no call. A dose of reality did the trick. Greg slaps you back into reality but Liz is there to tell you its going to be ok. Wish there were more people like them around. Required reading for any female over the age of 16.
B000002UAO|5.0|I actually had a cassette of this about ten years ago (I was really into the Beatles then, I was an eight-year-old kid with long, shaggy brown hair like them), but my cousin's walkman ate it... I was upset, sure, but I kinda shrugged it off. <br /> <br />Now, in 2005, at 18 (approaching 19), re-discovering my love for the Beatles' music (not to mention Paul McCartney's great halftime show at the Super Bowl), I just bought another copy (a CD this time, obviously), and, boy, what a great album it actually is. This just might be my favorite Beatles album. <br /> <br />It's got the hits \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"Nowhere Man\\", but the true standouts are the great ballads \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\", and \\"In My Life\\". Also worth noting are \\"Think For Yourself\\" (George sings this one), \\"Run For Your Life\\", \\"Girl\\", et cetera. This album has got the early Beatles sound, but with some experimentation that would lead into their 1966 album \\"Revolver\\". It made for a solid record in '65, and it still holds true today. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you wanna hear a good, classic album, check this one on out. Needless to say, it's leagues ahead of most of the unlistenable schlop being released today.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This album left me with alot of questions..not least of which is how a band can rule this hard? My mind was blown when I heard this...like I was brought to metal by Cradle of Filth, Dying Fetus, Cannibal Corpse ect. but this...this is a beast of a different color all togeather. Where as with bands like Fetus and Corpse you get sort of a heavy yet muffled sound LoG comes through loud..clear..and pissed off. This cd is CRUCIAL for any person into metal, hardcore, metalcore, death metal ect. ..dare I say it? country?
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has matured over the years but still retains that rebelous, youthful appeal.  American Idiot is by far their best work to date.  Full of catchy tunes and bankable riffs, this one is definitely a keeper!
B00005JKES|5.0|Black humour and spooky moments abound in this brilliant David Lynch T.V. production. It is a production you would need to watch from the very start to follow the complicated twists and turns in the plot.... But it is well worth the effort. Twin Peaks is about the investigation into the murder of local girl Laura Palmer. As the story unfolds it becomes apparent that no one is as they appear in this town (and that includes eccentric FBI investigator, Agent Dale Cooper).<br /><br />To say the characters are quirky is putting it mildly, it may be more accurate to say they are verging on the insane which certainly makes it impossible to figure out who the murderer is...most of the population of Twin Peaks have secrets they don't want exposed.<br /><br />This series became cult viewing in the 90's and it is easy to see why. David Lynch has produced a masterpiece that dares to be different and makes no apology for it. Brilliant, bizarre, funny, moving, it will make you laugh and cry. Highly recommended.
B00065LY1I|5.0|Even though many in this country only know her as that cute diva who came out of nowhere with a pair of hit singles in 2002, Kylie Minogue has in fact been on an exceptionally long path ablaze with creative twists and turns. The newly released \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" serves as an ideal retrospective that summarizes nearly two decades of the Aussie singer's melt-in-your-mouth pop confections. Twenty-seven of the set's thirty-three tracks reached the Top 10 in the UK.<br /><br />The first disc, which contains recordings from the late 80's and early 90's, kicks off with the frantic \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" from her 1990 album \\"Rhythm of Love.\\" A fast-paced track with strong vocals and an undeniable hook, it epitomizes the pop sensibility and the lovable plonkety-plonk production of the era that satiates the first half of the collection.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing things about these songs is that, although her remake of Little Eva's 1962 hit \\"The Loco-Motion\\" was her only runaway hit in the US in 1988 before she disappeared from stateside radar for a decade and a half, it is the least enduring track on the first disc. This thus proves the worth of songwriting team Stock, Aitken and Waterman. who penned the great majority of her early string of hits while reportedly controlling her image and sound with a resented iron first.<br /><br />As a result, selections such as the urgent \\"I Should Be So Lucky, \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" and \\"Got Be Certain\\" are pure listening pleasure. Her cover of Chairman of the Board's \\"Give Me Just a Little More Time\\" from her 1991 album \\"Let's Get to It\\" is also surprisingly soulful, although her rendition of Kool and the Gang's \\"Celebration\\" which rounds out the disc sounds like it belongs on a tape to play in the car for your child under 4.<br /><br />The onset of the second disc flips us into present-day Kylie with her new single \\"I Believe In You,\\" an entrancing slice of pulsating pop perfection she wrote with the Scissors Sisters that manages to pay homage to musical years gone by while still sounding fresh and original. Another new recording, \\"Giving You Up,\\" is included, along with selections dating back a decade.<br /><br />The sexy \\"Confide In Me\\" from 1994's self-titled CD finds Kylie cooing her lines to great success, while the introspectiveness of \\"Did It Again\\" and \\"Breathe\\" from her critically-acclaimed 1997 album \\"Impossible Princess\\" add ballast to the disc and prove that the pop starlet can indeed write substantial lyrics when she looks deep within.<br /><br />Selections from her 2000 album \\"Light Years\\" also add sizzle to the fire. \\"Spinning Around,\\" lucrative songwriter Kari Dioguardi's first hit, established Kylie as a dancefloor maven to outstanding success, as did the anthemic \\"On a Night Like This.\\" These tracks clearly set the stage for tracks like \\"Love at First Sight\\" and \\"Come Into My World\\" from 2002's \\"Fever.\\" The latter track is included here in its far superior radio version that won her a Grammy last year for Best Dance Recording.<br /><br />\\"Kids,\\" a left-field rock record with Robbie Williams and the bittersweet \\"Please Stay,\\" propelled by Spanish guitars and bubbly production, suggest that \\"Light Years\\" was a project that the US should not have missed out on. Furthermore, the ever catchy \\"Slow\\" and the radio version of \\"Chocolate\\" from 2004's extremely underrated \\"Body Language\\" album throw further entertainment into the mix.<br /><br />The disc closes with \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow,\\" her morbid mid-nineties collaboration with Aussie rocker Nick Cave that concludes with his murdering her that still continues to raise eyebrows.<br /><br />Although the capricious nature of the US music industry has caused Kylie Minogue to have a puddle of success in comparison to the rainstorm she continues to receive overseas, the reason for it has nothing to do with the quality of her music. \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" proves that repeatedly with its smorgasbord of solid tunes. If you haveever been even slightly interested in any of her music before but have never shelled out any of your hard-earned dollars, this is the definitive place to begin.d tunes.

B0000DZEE3|5.0|I just recently got my copy of \\"Live at Slane Castle\\" and I much say that by far this was the best DVD i've ever bought. I know that I may only be 18 and haven't been around for the 20 years of the Chili Peppers, but I've heard almost all of their music, and I've managed to get myself to a concert and this DVD was just like being at the concert all over again. The music was great and you know they love to perform for a crowd. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone.
B000002UJQ|5.0|While some of the most hardcore Radiohead fans actually think Kid A is their best, I still have to go with OK Computer.  The Bends had twinges of experimentalism, but to me it was still a rock album.  With the exception of Electioneering, there is nothing truly rocking about this album.  Instead, Radiohead uses electronics to great effect, coupled with their instruments.  Admittedly, this is not an easy album to get into.  I had to force myself over a period of weeks to listen to the entire album; you have to be in the right mood, at least initially.  Now though, I can listen to it any time.  Songs like Airbag, Paranoid Android, Exit Music, Let Down, Electioneering and Climbing Up the Walls are all amazing, though in truth there isn't a bad song on this album.  And that's what makes it so good.  Even Fitter Happier, whose lyrics were done by the text-to-speech program on Thom Yorke's Mac, conveys a very powerful message. <br /> <br />Overall, this might be the best album of the 90's.  Obviously you could contend that Nevermind and Siamese Dream were better, but I think OK Computer surpasses even those.  Thom Yorke, you are a genius.
B000059H99|5.0|This Oscar-Winning movie of 1976, \\"Rocky\\" is by far one of the greatest movies ever made to date. Sylvester Stallone made his acting debut in 1976 when he wrote the story of Rocky Balboa, an underdog Philadelphia club fighter with a heart of gold who has very little money, works for a mobster loanshark and falls in love with a shy girl named Adrian.This movie has a tremendous plot, wonderful character development and a very strong sense of power and novelty.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the fighting city of Philadelphia and here we meet Rocky Balboa in a club fight against a bum, Spider Rico. We see Rocky's everyday life in this movie. Rocky goes home to his pigsty apartment to two turtles named Cuff and Link and a Goldfish named Mobey Dick. Rocky romances and flirts with a shy, lonely and ignored pet shoped employee named Adrian (great job by Talia Shire). Rocky tries to open her up by telling her bad jokes, and tries to ask her out. Then Rocky goes to work as a muscle-man collector for a his loanshark boss, Tony Gazzo. Then Rocky goes to work out at his boxing gym across the street from Adrian, called Mickey's Gym. The owner of the gym is Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) who knows that Rocky has the heart and talent to become a good fighter. Then after workout, Rocky goes to the neighborhood bar and has a few beers with his Paulie (Burt Young), Adrian's rude and inconsiderate brother.<br /><br />Everything is the same in Rocky's life and nothing changes. Rocky continues to fight bums and doesn't get anywhere. Then one day, a shot of freak-luck changes his life forever. Rocky is given a shot at the World Heavyweight Title by the Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) on New Years Eve at the Philadelpia Spectrum. Apollo decided to give a local Philadelphia underdog fighter a shot at the title and he picked Rocky. Reluctant at first, Rocky doesn't want to fight Apollo because he is convinced that he is nowhere near as good as Apollo. The promoter of the fight tests Rocky's patriotism and cons Rocky into accepting the challenge. Now with the help of Mickey, Rocky begins to train for a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Rocky's goal is to do what no fighter has ever done before: Go the distance with Apollo Creed.<br /><br />Now with Mickey as his expert trainer, Paulie and Adrian, his new girlfriend by his side in support of him, Rocky is ready to fight the greatest fighter of the world. This movie is the story of the American dream: From rags to riches.<br /><br />This movie is timeless, it's a masterpiece and is one of the greatest films of all time. Sylvester Stallone not only made his debut as an actor here but also did a phenomenal job writing this movie. It's a wondeful movie all the way for anyone to enjoy. The DVD features Audio Commentary throughout the movie from the cast and crew such as: Carl Weathers, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Director John G. Avildsen. This DVD has tons of special features such as: Theatrical Trailers from all 5 \\"Rocky\\" movies, Tribute to Burgess Meredith, Sylvester Stallone commentary and many, many more.

B000063COX|5.0|Those of you expecting dungeons and dragons lyrics mixed in with synthesizers and falsetto vocals are in for something else.  Iron Maiden's debut album is a rough, undiluted, and highly creative combination of metal, punk, and hard rock. <br /> <br />Prowler, with its memorable opening riff and incredible solo by Dave Murray, earns it place alongside Aces High and The Wicker Man as a classic album opener.  Sanctuary is a punk-flavored rocker with some appropriately rough vocals by Paul Dianno, who was in many ways Maiden's best singer.  Remember Tomorrow has a heavy midsection flanked by slower, moodier, and groove-oriented verses.  Running Free, a concert favorite, is somewhat simplistic, though it's not nearly as flat as when Bruce sings it nowadays.   <br />Phantom of The Opera is the album's centerpiece, a complex epic that puts most other songs by NWOBHM bands from that time to shame.  Clive Burr's drumming here is especially great, as it is on Transylvania, one of Maiden's better instrumentals.  The song leads into Strange World, the band's single best ballad.  I don't even want to think how Bruce would sound singing this one.  Dennis Stratton also has a great solo here.  Charlotte the Harlot and Iron Maiden both have the raw \\"street\\" feel that many Maiden songs in the future lack.   <br /> <br />Along with Killers and Number of the Beast, I would say that this debut is one of the band's very best.  A lot of debut albums seem very ameteurish and contain songs that all sound the same.  Iron Maiden, however, clearly shows that the players in the band were talented and professional from the get go.  This classic album has the diversity and edge that most of the band's future albums lack.
0316666343|5.0|The first chapter of this book is by far the most difficult, the central character is cruelly duped, assaulted and murdered and she is just 14.<br /><br /> What follows is the journey of she and her family as their pain and anger begins to undo and disintergrate them and then slowly, inch by inch, bring them back to each other with power and integrity.<br /><br /> The journey is one of agony, dissapoitment, guilt and redemption as the central character strives to build her new world and free those she left from the pain of her loss.<br /><br /> After the agony of chapter one I thought I could not go on with this book but it is more than worth sticking with.<br /><br /> And surely this is the Authors intention, not, as he been suggested by many, to sensationalise child murder. But to profile and ease the journey. What better way for us to consider the horror of such an event than to placed in postion of emapathy. This book does just that superbly.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|It's a 4.75 for me. I can't give it a true 5 because alot of my favorite Beatles songs arent on it. But that's by design so I don't penalize it too much. But also for that reason it doesn't have the perfection 5 stars would suggest. <br /> <br />I bought this album shortly after it was released to see what all the fuss was regarding the Beatles. Non-commercial hip hop is my first love, but I like something from practically all styles and genres of music, so I said \\"What the hay? Other people seem to like it...\\" Years later, this CD is still in heavy rotation within my rather large collection. From the very first listen, I understood why the band has been the recipient of so many critical and popular accolades. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, \\"1\\" was a springboard to Beatles fandom for me (tho it was a complete play-thru of all their American releases a year ago, in commemoration of their first Sullivan gig, by radio station 97.1 here in Chicago that really increased my interest in them). Since then, I have obtained all their original albums from \\"Rubber Soul\\" to \\"Let it Be\\", have settled on a favorite period of the band's career (psychadelic onward; all their subject matter before and parts of \\"Rubber Soul\\" were boy-bandish, tho I do appreciate the fine instrumentalism), have decided on favorite albums (\\"Sgt Pepper\\" and especially \\"Abbey Road\\"), and have developed other informed opinions on the band. While I don't feign to act like I can keep up with the most dedicated Beatles aficianodos, I can surely say I can contribute to conversations about them. That may never have been that case had I never listened to \\"1\\". <br /> <br />I can understand some of the problems people have with this CD. Many fans who were around when this was new music heard the songs in mono, and have a preference for such over stereo--George Martin himself had issues with stereo compared to mono in the 1960s. It's like the vinyl-vs-CD debate. Well, I'm 26; I'm of the digital-and-stereo generation. I admit I've heard few of their songs in mono form, so I'm not able to make an informed comparison. But the stereo's cool with me. True, there are some imperfections with the channel mixing. But it's not as if the engineers for this CD had flawless material to work with. And, as a fan of clarity, I'm really feeling the quality in that department. <br /> <br />As for the band and their music heard here: They're crafty lyricists and play their instruments well (tho as a former drummer I have my personal reservations about Ringo), they're versatile in styles, and the chemistry is noticeable. Can't say much that hasn't already been said. Believe the hype. <br /> <br />Yes, I have heard of \\"20 Greatest Hits\\" from over 20 years ago, and how it was a nearly identical compilation to \\"1\\". But not many in my generation were old enough or alive to have been aware of that. Yes, there are more thorough Beatles compilations (\\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" albums, for example). I don't believe they're as accessible, literally or figuratively. And yes, EMI made a huuuuuuuuge amount of money on this CD. But to use that fact as evidence to support an argument to detract fom this CD is silly. Capitalism aside, this CD was (partly) designed to give the mp3 generation a neatly-packaged introduction to the Beatles. And when you look at the praise lavished on it by Billboard and others when it was new, it was pretty successful in that purpose. <br /> <br />I would agree this is not a necessary album for many hardcore Beatles fans, nor a perfect compilation (based on tracklist) by many criteria. But to suggest to others not to buy it--as some here have--yet go around to \\"Spread The Word\\" about the band like Gospel and how others are simply lesser, does a disservice not only to music fans not exposed to the Beatles but perhaps in a small measure to the legacy of the band. If you're unfamiliar with the Beatles, but have an interest in seeing what they are about from beginning to end yet don't know where to start, I say this is the CD to pick up. Then ya just take it from there...
0671027387|3.0|To start off, Dan Brown is an excellent writer. However, I do not think that his greatest strength is in pure science as much as the fine arts. His artistic comments in The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons were very insightful.<br /><br />In Deception Point he attempts to create a world where emminent astronomists can be fooled into thinking an ocean rock is a meteorite and highly trained assasins can not only be evaded, but incapacited, negotiated with, and even killed.<br /><br />Although the writing IS good, it reveals one of Brown's rare weaknesses. I still do recommend it, but it will cause you to pause in your reading to stare disbelievingly at the book many times closer to the end
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Interstella 5555 is a fantastic tale of a musical group from another planet who get kidnapped by an evil human manager, blah blah blah world domination, blah blah blah.  The point is, this is a DVD that contains videos for ALL of the songs from Daft Punk's Discovery album.  If you like Discovery, I recommend Interstella 5555.  With the trippy lights and musically-charged emotions, this is a DVD worth multiple viewings.  Check it out.
B000002IZ4|5.0|I said enough with the title.
B000008LOV|5.0|If you don't own a copy of this album, then you should seriously consider getting one.<br /><br />Almost 17 years after its release, I'm still amazed at how incredible the music is on here. Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, and George Harrison - each of them are justifiably legendary musicians. Here you get all of them together, sounding even better than you'd expect them to.<br /><br />Several reviewers here have commented on how it sounds like the band is having a total blast on these songs. I totally agree and think that's one of the reasons this music is so incredibly fun to listen to. It's obvious that these guys just checked their egos at the door and set out to make great music and have a great time doing it.<br /><br />Handle With Care, Last Night, Rattled, Heading For The Light - all fantastic songs!  Actually, there's not a song on here that isn't great in some way - and that's a rare feat for any performer to accomplish.<br /><br />Two of my personal favorites on here are Not Alone Anymore and Margarita. On Not Alone Anymore, Roy Orbison's voice is absolutely magical. It's no wonder that he was regarded as highly as he was! As for Margarita...geez...what can I say? The music is addicting within the first few seconds. Then the harmonies kick in - and these 5 guys sound like they were born to be singing with each other. The lyrics are very entertaining and the guitar riffs are great. This is a VERY fun song!<br /><br />I meant for this to be a short review, but I'm listening to this CD as I'm typing. Listening to this cd, soaking in each great song...well, it got hard for me to not rave and rave about how great this album is.<br /><br />If you love rock and roll and have this album, then you already know what I'm talking about above. If you love great music and don't yet have this album - get it soon. You'll be glad you did.
B00009Z576|4.0|Before you yesfreaks call for my head - listen up.  I first got into the band as this album was released and caught them on tour for the first time in support of the album.  In addition, they performed 'in the round', which added to the experience.  As far as Drama itself, what a wonderful, fresh sounding Yes.  The album still holds up rather well.  Enjoy it for the musicianship, and please don't compare Trevor Horn to Jon.  His voice was absolutely amazing on the recording as well as in concert, not only for Drama, but for their classic tracks as well.  You Yesheads (and I include myself in this group) should know that Trevor performed \\"And You and I\\" better, yes better -- than I've ever heard Jon do it.  Downes was equally effective on keys and could transition from the 'old' yes sounds to the 'new' with no problem.  In fact, I don't feel Geoff has ever come close, musically speaking, with anything he's ever done with Asia - and this comes from someone who really never cared for The Buggles either. I only wish this lineup had forged ahead.  80's music might have had more legitacy - especially with this band instead of the mediocracy of 90125, Big Generator and anything Asia, regardless of their commercial successes.  One listen to Drama gives you the sense that Squire, Howe and White were actually having fun again making music without having to put up with Jon and Rick's pompousity.  My reason for not giving it five stars is that I wanted more material.  Well I will now shut my mouth and wait for the hate mail to come in.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is, easily, one of the funniest movies ever made - if you have a taste for absurd humor, that is. There is a semi-coherent plot which manages to tie the movie together, only enhancing the hilarity of scenes such as The Witch Burning Scene, The Killer R-r-r-rabbit, and the Bridge of Death. <br /> <br />Moving on, the DVD set is fantastic. In addition to the movie, there are a ton of extras (including the \\"Knights of the Round Table\\" song as performed by Lego's, and subtitles taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV Part II). This really is a must-have for any Python fans.
B000002C25|4.0|This album deserves 4 stars. <br />Of course it came right after Whats the story morning glory, which made Oasis the biggest and best band in the world. <br /> <br />But this really caused a stir, as it was expected to be so much more. <br />In no way is this a classic album, but musically it very good and quite loud. <br />Their is a huge wall of guitars behind the louder songs such as \\"D'youknow what I mean\\" \\"My Big Mouth\\" \\"Be Here Now\\" and the \\"Fade In Out\\". <br /> <br />Noel gallaghar blamed his cocaine habit for the failure and dissapointment that this album created, but really its not a bad album at all.
0140187537|4.0|The Nobel Prize committee mentioned THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT in awarding the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature to Steinbeck--and in so doing touched off a critical backlash against both the novel and Steinbeck's entire body of work.  The novel had not been popular with American critics or American readers, and the author was savagely attacked as \\"past it,\\" his current works dismissed as irrelevant and his earlier works as overrated.  Steinbeck was so humilated that he did not publish another novel in his lifetime.<br /><br />Part of critical reaction was due to the novel's structure, which jumps from third person to first person narrative and from character to character in an extremely jarring manner--and which in terms of plot seems prepared to run off in a dozen different directions but never actually does.  But it may be more accurate to say that the bedrock of critical animosity was the nature of the story itself: an unflattering tale of America at its most hypocritical and corrupt.  Given the tenor of the times, it was not a portrait that American critics or the reading public cared to embrace.<br /><br />Ethan Hawley is a descendent of a notable New England shipping family--but the advent of petroleum products destroyed the whaling industry and the family fortune declined.  As the novel opens, Ethan is a clerk in the very grocery store he once owned. His wife loves him, but is embarrassed for him; his two children, hungry for the luxuries of the small town upper class, are less discreet in their sentiments.  At least Ethan has the satisfaction of knowing that he is a man of integrity ... but one day, for no significant reason at all, his eyes are suddenly opened to the truth.  He can have it all.  But there is a price to pay: his conscience.<br /><br />Steinbeck's works frequently deal with the struggle between personal integrity and worldly success, but THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT is quite unlike his other works, for instead of painting the battle in broad strokes Steinbeck explores a gray area that gradually darkens to black--and suddenly ends the novel on a slightly ambiguous note, leaving the reader to wonder if Ethan will fight his way out of the darkness or merely strive to protect his family from knowledge of it.<br /><br />Perhaps more so than other Steinbeck novel, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT requires a careful reading.  Yes, the structure is jarring, and yes the plot seems to run hither and yon, but at the same time these elements actually mirror the disconnected nature of the characters in a way that becomes increasingly disconcerting as the book progresses.  And while there is no doubt that the book is deeply flawed, there is no denying the author's power, a power that seems to arise as much from his failings as from his virtues.  As always, Steinbeck takes great risks in his work, and part of the pleasure in reading one of his novels is in seeing how well the gamble pays off.<br /><br />I would not place THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT in the first rank of Steinbeck novels--but it certainly did not deserve the scorn heaped upon it in the early 1960s and which continues, to a certain extent, to dog it to this very day.  Memorable, provocative, powerful, and recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerstrokes Steinbeck explores a gray area that gradually darkens to black--and suddenly ends the novel on a slightly ambiguous note, leaving the reader to wonder if Ethan will fight his way out of the darkness or merely strive to protect his family from knowledge of it.<br /><br />Perhaps more so than other Steinbeck novel, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT requires a careful reading.

B00028HBKM|2.0|I can sum it up in one sentence: The Worst Movie that I ever saw. I know that Christs last hours were horrifying, but this movie, the way it is cut, goes way beyond what the Bible says. It is like he wanted to make the goriest movie of all times, not a factual account of Christs last hours. It was so bad that I couldnt watch the whole movie. I wish the Mel Gibson had made a \\"REAL\\" movie of his last hours. Save your money, and read the bible for the truth.
B00025ETIW|1.0|Ok listen this band isnt good i mean all they do is scream. There lyrics in some of there songs are ok but this isnt music... if you want real music check out (Straylight run, Brand new or Cursive)
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|On the whole this album just is'nt that great, and at time is downright boring. <br /> <br />The best moments are \\"Take Me Out\\" \\"Jaqeline\\" and \\"Michael\\". <br /> <br />\\"Take Me Out\\" being the best song to be written in years. <br /> <br />Not a great album though.
B0000630BT|5.0|What a difference from the previous offerings. Harder, faster, heavier and frikin' killer!!!!!! Man what a change in direction here. Does changing the drummer make that much difference? I guess in this case it does as it allowed Priest to open up and expand on their riffage world. The cd is probably one of their best, in fact I'd say it's in the top 3. It's to bad metal was suffering from lack of attention in the early 90's as this cd would have been a huge success in the sales department had it been released a few years earlier. As it was, only the diehards were left to truly appreciate this metal masterpiece. Rob Halford saw the writing on the wall and split shortly after the tour finished up to try his own thing. Metal had died commercially, but musically, this is where it's at!!<br /><br />A true metal must have!!
B00006879E|5.0|Unknown in the 90's as Kara's Flowers, an addition to a new member and a metamorphic blend of R&B, pop, and rock create a refreshing if not acclaimed alternative album worthy of purchase, <br />and of course its excessive airplay. A breath of fresh air in the radio industry of cringingly overplayed punk rock tunes, Maroon 5 infuses a genre span of addicting melodies and lyrics theming passion through lead singer Adam Levine's high octave voice, heartfelt tone and swaggering delivery in comparison to the whiny, exaggerating sounds of bubblegum boyband and popular <br />punk rock bands. \\"This Love,\\" \\"She Will Be Loved,\\" \\"Harder To Breathe,\\" and \\"Sunday Morning\\" are the records most famous, and the four greatest songs on a mega-hit packed CD, also featured <br />on two motion picture soundtracks and an acoustic concert album. The compilation revolves around Jane, with hints of sex and desire. \\"This Love\\" struck first with an amazing original tune that is easily recognized, alongside a similar \\"Harder To Breathe\\" and a slower \\"She Will Be Loved\\". In my opinion the most touching track is \\"Sunday Morning,\\" their latest hit single but overlooked for  more recognition. An almost throwback to Motown, \\"Sunday Morning\\" features a sensational melody with its highest amount of passion and poignancy, complete with enough artistry and impressive vocals and instrumentation that should haved recieved Grammy consideration. I honestly haven't heard anything that has moved me more this year, with the kind of catch that you can sing to or smile whenever it's been played. Only time will tell whether their next release will succeed over its predecessor, but regardless the band has recieved immense <br />popularity and has given this year in music an innovating aura, especially 2004 being an incredible year for newcomers and mainstream music. Up for the best new artist category in the 47th Annual Grammy Awards, Maroon 5 is a tough competitor and a force to be reckoned with, thanks to theirdebut hit album that is a definitive buy.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I got this movie like 3 weeks ago but i havent watched it until now due to i wanted to save it for a good time. and all i have to say is wow, good movie. Sad but good, and i dont care what the critics say this movie rocked.
B000068QY7|2.0|This is the album that made everyone realise Oasis are still around and are back. <br />After two albums that they blew it with, maybe not musically but certainly what they were renouwned for. <br />Which is writing the best rock n roll guitar songs in the world. <br /> <br />So with Heathen Chemistry they have gone back to basics. <br />There are some classic tunes on here: \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" \\"Little By Little \\"Born On a Different Cloud\\" (should of been a single), \\"The Hindu Times\\" just does'nt \\"quite\\" cut it, but is still good. <br /> <br />As for the rest of the album, well I think they needed a producer (and not Owen Morris) rather than the band just deciding what goes on the record, cause as a whole, its not that good. <br />And really, just cause the band like this or that song, it does'nt neccesarily mean the fans will buy it always. <br /> <br />The songs just are'nt here on this one.
B00005K9LN|5.0|So what more needs to be said? This cd represents Priest before they turned the corner when it comes to international acclaim. It's rocks from start to finish and has some radio friendly tunes on it like Living after midnight and Breaking the law. All in all good stuff and it showed us a glimpse of what Priest was going to offer us just around the next corner.
B0000640VO|5.0|Man, this is like the ultimate chick flick, but I swear, I would marry Amelie in a second. She's cute, but not too much, is smart and scheming and so full of goodness. Makes you want to move to gay Paree and find someone like her. You can't help but watch this and say YAY Amelie, YAY!
B00008H2LB|1.0|I mean come on.  these sellouts are crap.  they sing or rap about how much their life sux and people like it. It is not metal, and it is not rap.  it is some sick combination of the two that is more horrible than emo and not nearly as good as metal, not by a long shot. dont waste your time on this album
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is U2s most impressive album, here they have become badder and rockier in their sound, and have used electronic sound acroos some of the album (not alot though) and The Edges fanatstic experimentation with his guitars is just a fanatastic listen. <br /> <br />Probably the best U2 album along with \\"War\\". <br />Very cool and very rock n roll.
B00005R62N|5.0|This is the best live album ever made, period!!<br /><br />The remaster has included some great bonus tracks that totally bring this gem out of the closet an into the limelight yet again. From the get go this cd screams classic metal and has energy to burn. Halford is the Metal God and his reign is undisputed. Yes this is a true metal masterpiece. Buy it and relive the glory days of one of metals founding fathers.<br /><br />The Priest is back!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002234LS|2.0|Johnny Depp is one of the most versitle, uniquely weird yet brilliant actors around.  He's nice to look at as well, but Secret Window is a pure disapointment.  Yes, this movie begins with a classic plot and moves along rather smoothly as you become involved in the rather bizarre happenings.  You begin to sympathize with Depps character but then the ending just makes the entire movie stupid!  When the credits begin to roll, you sit there asking yourself why you watched this stupid movie in the first place.
B00000JCOV|1.0|these people try to be good but they arent... at all.  they have no musical skill and there songs arent all that good.  they too have become sell outs.  they will be on trl.  trl=sellout.  they are reeeeeeally bad.  Want good thrash? listen to slayer.  exodus. mercyful fate.  megadeth.  i could go on.  and to those of you who think that thrash bands have no skill, that is because you listen to slipknot.
B000000WF0|5.0|Why is everyone to scared to admit that this is one of the best albums of all time. <br /> <br />Because it is!!! Definitley one of the best! <br /> <br />THE VERVE need to form again, just make one more album, they've got it in them!
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|Oscar nominations,wonderful cast,incredible director,compelling story...wasn't that great.  One of my friends kept telling me that I'd love this film.  That it was one of the greatest movies ever.  I have to disagree.  The cast of this film were quite convincing in their potrayals of characters,Sean Penn especially playing another darkly,intense character.  My heart broke when I saw the scene of him finding out that his daughter was indeed killed,being held back by plenty of police officers in an attempt to get to her.  Sean Penn's scenes were the only reason this film should even be watched. He deserved the Academy Award win for this film.  Yes,you go on a weaving of story plots with an ending that may surprise you but there's really no substance in my mind.  This is a film that I recommend you rent and watch only once...if even that.
B000002WFF|5.0|This is a classic album in every sense of the word. This album mixes live and studio recordings to accompany the 1970 documentary \\"Elvis - That's The Way It is\\".  <br />The result is one of Elvis' best ever efforts (and that's saying something). As good (or should i say great!) as they were, his albums of the 50s and 60s do not match up to this extraordinary effort, from a singer who had always been extraordinary since the start. <br /> <br />Fresh from the success of the chart-topping single \\"The Wonder of you\\" and the hot \\"On Stage\\" album, Presley was on a roll. <br />The album \\"That's the way it is\\" contained a mere 12 of many songs recorded at the live shows, rehearsals and studio sessions during this time. Nevertheless why complain when the result is a true 5 STAR album as this? <br /> <br />It has a huge Country feel from the first cut (\\"I just can't help believing\\") and this is echoed throughout most of the album. <br />I actually bought this album after hearing 2 songs. The already mentioned Just can't help believing\\" and Elvis' version of the Simon and Garfunkel classic \\"Bridge over troubled water\\", whioch ironically is the albums last song. <br /> <br />The material in-between does not disappoint.  <br />\\"Just Pretend\\" has to be the highlight. This is my second favourite song Presley EVER recorded (right next too \\"If I can dream\\", recorded 2 years earlier). <br />This is the ultimate love song about a man who has argued with his love and has left, however (obviously the two are in a telephone conversion) miles apart, both are now wishing they were back together.  <br />Presley then sings \\"I'll come flying to you again, all the crying is true/through, I will hold you and love you again, but until then, well, Just Pretend\\". A marvellous song. <br /> <br />Unlike a lot of Live albums (this was half live, half studio) we are treated to 100% material never before released by Elvis. <br />\\"That's the way it is\\" shows Elvis at his best. This proves the later Elvis material was right up their with anything he had done before.  <br /> <br />Anyone who claims he was past it in 1960, should check this set out. It's Presley's finest.
B000002MUW|4.0|I've just got my copy from amazon.com this morning; i recorded it one my mini disc and went to the supermarket. It was a good trip cause there are songs i remember to have listened when I was at the highschool (secret, take a bow, humane nature...the singles). Anyway, the whole disc is excelent, it has a lot of good songs (forbidden love as a example). It is a pity this album is very unknown, despite the singles, it's not one of the more commented.
B000002AS3|5.0|Definitley (not maybe) the best debut album of all time. <br /> <br />Some may say \\"awwwwwwwwww, its appeatite for destruction by guns n roses) <br /> <br />Slash is a better guitarist and Axel may be more of an outrageous singer, but that album does'nt have songs that are as amazing as  \\"Live Forever\\" and as cool as \\"Supersonic\\", \\"Columbia\\" or \\"Cigaretted and Alcoholed \\".  <br /> <br />Live Forever probably being the best song of all time to date - I'm not kidding!
B00005JNPZ|4.0|It appears as though you only need one surprise-hit film, one more notably found during a time period at the box office that has been particularly dead-silent for movie studios in years past, in order to make a name for yourself in Hollywood, or at least in the romance genre of the film industry. After bursting out of the gate big time in September 2002 with Sweet Home Alabama, the Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy which went on to gross close to one-hundred and thirty million dollars domestically, Andy Tennant, whose directorial credentials have been severely limited to a small number of lackluster features such as Ever After and Anna & the King, now helms marquee name Will Smith in a more ambitious, and therefore more highly-anticipated, film but the question still remains as to whether he truly has what it takes inside to deliver the hit film the studio needs whenever they demand it of him. <br /> <br />The story centers on the man who thought he knew everything there is to know about getting a man to sweep the love of his life off her feet and how it had it all wrong when a cynical woman walks into his life. Alex Hitchens, also known as Hitch, has been declared the date doctor amongst his clientele within New York City by helping the desperate men who contact him to land the love of their lives. His philosophy of relationships is actually quite simple - any man can sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom. His next client is a bank accountant named Albert, who is about as clumsy and downright pathetic as a person of his age can get but still maintains a quality that makes him admirable. While he helps Albert attempt to pull off what seems like the impossible, Alex falls head over heels for a beautiful woman named Sara, a gossip columnist with a cynical view on both men, which is that they are only out for the next woman to land in bed with, and life in general. Sadly, in spite of his extensive list of past cliental success thanks to his techniques, this time around he can not seem to get his practices right around her and yet she still remains attracted to him despite this. The story for Hitch follows in the hollow footsteps of every other romantic-comedy feature that has come before its time, adhering to the same basic blueprint storyline and committing the exact sins and vices as has been accustomed for audiences, boyfriends at least, but in turn does so with such convincing style and flare that it does not become a hindrance at all. Andy Tennant, the director who also helmed the Reese Witherspoon surprise-hit, Sweet Home Alabama, has clearly acquired a knack of sorts for this particular genre, or maybe it actually is more along the lines of hand-picking the right actors, or actresses, in the lead roles that allows these films to connect with audiences so readily. In any event, Hitch's meritable message that in spite of our best intentions there are no magic formulas, potions, or specific game plans to tie down the love of our lives, if we are even aware of it at the time we meet them, and we have only to be ourselves to find acceptance makes the whole two-hours effort worth the price of admission, especially on a Valentine's Day weekend. <br /> <br />Will Smith is positively charming, witty, and, must it be said, stylish in the role of Alex Hitchens, also known as the date doctor. The romantic-comedy genre, or comedies in general, is the precise arena in which Smith should use to his benefit his charming comedic stick as opposed to dramas of a semi-seriousness nature, I Robot being a prominent example, where it tends to throw off the flow of the storyline for its audience. Sure, there are some questions left unanswered as to how Hitch went from being a geeky lovelorn loser as he was back in college to the classy professional he is today, but its audience automatically accepts the notion that it just happened. It is after all a romantic comedy, is it not? Would you truly come to expect clear and precise logic or reason from this genre? On the other hand though, unlike films of this specific genre, there appears quite an equal balance in the amount of screen time, if not the quality of their particular scenes together or separate, between Will Smith's Alex Hitchens and Eva Mendes' Sara, of which she performs adequately well. There may be a time in the not too distant future that she could stray away from the usual eye-candy or limited comedic roles she has been reduced to over the last few years but as it works for her at the moment there are truly no complaints with her performance. As had been abundantly clear in the film's trailer leading up to its release, Kevin James, star of the CBS prime-time television series King of Queens, undoubtedly steals the spotlight, if only for a short period of time, from his fellow co-stars in Hitch, which for once is actually a fantastic quality to have seeing as how this is first major film role. Every single scene he makes an appearance in goes practically without a single misstep, or at least nothing that was noteworthy that is. Now if only lead roles, of which he will receive in the not too distant future, will be as easily accomplished as this. <br /> <br />Overall, Hitch more then states the obvious in its observations about relationships, which is bluntly that men are bumbling idiots when it comes to love and women are nearly as clueless as they are (though certainly less commonly or explicitly), which certainly not advance within the field of love if that is what you were hoping for. But, on the more optimistic side of things, this film does conveniently provide with an opportunity to take that special someone out to catch a charming, if not often clich filled, romantic comedy. Here is yet another example of a high-profile feature in which a fair majority of the gags found within this two-hour film are visibly present, either entirely or partially, in its trailer. The surprising quality of Hitch, as opposed to so manyother projects that have fallen flat on their face in part to this horrendous marketing move, is that when these elements are placed within the proper contexts of the script they become more humorous then they had been beforehand. This helps separate this picture from the rest of the drawn-out romantic comedy pack that has plagued movie theaters the past few years. A small problem the film tends to run into occasionally, only when either the direction or the script calls for it to be this way, is that the dialogue and the actions of the characters onscreen become overtly, border-line excruciatingly, clichd. But, when you think about seriously, is this not the curse of every romantic comedy churned out by Hollywood within the past decade, if not longer? Another fate of chick-flicks' past that this film has managed successfully to avoid is the bubble-gum pop laden soundtrack, which, though rarely addictive, happens to have worn out its inventiveness. Bottom-line, Hitch gets its point across though in the fact that through our lives we will have the fortunate opportunity to meet a wide-range of astonishing individuals who click instantly with us, many of whom we will be forced to lose at some point or another. But unless we are willing to take the risk involved and face rejection and heartache on occasion, we will never know for sure and that will be a fate worse then anything else life can throw at you. As the date-doctor himself so eloquently put it, any man can truly sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom to do it, which is whatever you want to make of it in your life.
B0002X314C|5.0|This alum is hands down on the the best I've heard in a long long time. It's so real and his voice is genuine if you have doubts don't it's way too good!!!
B0000931OG|4.0|Bit optimistic about this one before purchasing it. <br />Gee it sure shows you should listen to yourself and not what people say, this is another great album from, Blur. <br /> <br />When you listen to it, you can tell Graham Coxon is not in the band. As the songs don't seem to have the same to sort of tone as many of their others not that it matters. <br /> <br />\\"Ambulance\\" \\"Out of Time\\" and  \\"Crazy Beat\\" are the standouts, the rest take some time to grow on you. <br /> <br />Another great album from Blur.
B00005NEUF|5.0|Ah,, for heavens sake this is good stuff. Even though its acquired taste, my tase fits it perfectly. Its strange; because most of the Bands that are supposedly like them are good, but i dont care much for them. (except the yeah yeah yeahs) anyway, this is simply amazing. I love this album
0930289234|5.0|I won't waste time praising Watchmen. There are several negative reviews here many of which level the accusation of it being boring. These reviews are evidently written by people who didn't understand the premise and appreciate the subtle nuance of the writing. Don't let these reviews put you off reading one of the finest books of any sort published in the last 30 years
0802130208|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces basks in the same limelight as the acting of Laurel and Hardy or The Three Stooges through John Kennedy Toole's character Ignatius Reilly. A Confederacy of Dunces truly is an American novel whose characters are over the top, who all like to hate the quasi(?) intellectual protagonist, fat and flatulent Ignatius Reilly. Self-absorbed and flat-out wrong most of the time, Ignatius pinballs his way through life comically messing up anyone and everyone (who has the misfortune to run into him) through his bungling, over-bearing thought process. A great read, a great book. Kudos to John Kennedy Toole.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|you've heard it all about this band.  but nobody mentions how much fun it is to dance to.  Not like dance in a club kind of dancing.  But dancing in your room while putting on friday night's outfit.  Dancing in your head while the songs play over and over again inside!  I hate when things get all sorts of hype, but, man, this thing is just so fun, it's almost unbelievable!!!
B00005JMYI|1.0|I like Will Ferrell, I thought he was hilarious in Elf, but this was horrible! Very rarely will I turn off a movie before it is finished, but this one left me little choice. It just wasn't funny at all! It's filled with trashy \\"comedy\\" that only an annoying sleeze ball would laugh at. Save your money on this one!
B00005QCYC|5.0|Everyone knows the first Jurassic Park movie rocked.  The Lost World was just as good, but it was more of the same: thrilling dinosaurs and chases scenes with dinosaurs that look completely real.  The third Jurassic Park movie was not quite as good, but still a great movie.  It had all the ingredients and I really enjoyed all three.
B00003CXCT|1.0|No thanks.  I'll keep my memories.
0767805712|5.0|I'm a big movie fan & this is one of the movies that can be watched anytime because it's got quite a universal theme. <br />It's a science fiction movie set in the not-so-distant future on earth. Everything will be determined by science, even your genetic make-up, and that would be what matters ... nothing else. <br />Ethan Hawke plays as a \\"God's child,\\" someone who was conceived naturally, without the intervention of science in order to determine his genetic make-up. His whole future could already be 'read' when he was born with a single drop of his blood sample, e.g. his approximate years of life span, any future health complications, etc. <br />His dream was to fly into space and although he has the intelligence for the job, his genetic make-up hinders his dream. <br />This movie is about what science cannot intervene: fate. Ethan Hawke wants to achieve his dream and nothing could stop him. He wanted to create his own fate, not the fate that was determined by the doctors on the first day he was born. <br />The human body is so great and so adaptable, that even science cannot read the future of our bodies, biologically.
1878424319|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT book for anyone whose search for some inner peace is still ongoing or for those who just want to clear out the inner clutter. <br /> <br />The Four Agreements are profound in their simplicity and when put into practice make life much easier.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Almost everything that I could say about Firefly is already posted.  It truly holds a special place in the hearts of Joss Whedon fans.  All that I feel should be added to these reviews are two things.  First, in September...go see the movie version entitled \\"Serenity\\"!!!  If this movie does well, several movies shall follow and who knows...maybe the series will be picked up again.  And second, the special features on this DVD set are so wonderful.  Probably some of the best features on a Whedon DVD collection; including an audition, a gag reel, a heart-renching featurette and much more.  Buy the DVD, go see the movie!  Support Serenity!
B000670DQI|4.0|I bought this item expecting the videos for singles off of David Bowie's REALITY CD.  Well... you get videos, but not the ones made for VH-1 or MTV airplay.  They are mostly just artsy shots of trees or NYC, and sometimes Bowie in a studio in one outfit singing along.  The \\"REALITY FILM\\" is interesting, but it offers only small insight into the album and is mainly a performance art piece with Bowie interviewing himself on art and whether he prefers ketchup or mustard.  It does however feature A GREAT 5.1 sound mix that you can pop into a DVD player and hear 5 channels of one of Bowie's best releases in recent years.  For that it is awesome, just don't expect much more.  You do get lyrics on-screen as well which helps if you want to learn every word to the songs.  Great album by the way!  Be warned though - this dual disc may not play in ALL CD players.  It is rare that it is incompatible, but people with older players might be wary of it.
B000005RTG|4.0|A thousand rock bands have tried to emulate Eddie Vedder and Van Halen.  Eddie Vedder and Van Halen unquestionably used this as their blueprint. As a teenager, I collected the entire Deep Purple catalog, and this definitely marks their finest hour.  Gone, along with Ritchie Blackmore, are the arena rock anthems and(in hindsight) onanistic guitar solos, etc.  \\"Side 1\\" still kicks out the jams, but \\"Side 2\\" finds the band moving more toward a contemplative, yes, even spiritual direction, probably thanks to the influence of the guitar tripping of Tommy Bolin.  \\"You keep on moving\\" and \\"This time around\\" are nothing short of exquisite.  This album stands as the last parting shot from a great band.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|No matches for Wrestlemania 21 have been announced yet, but I have a card prediction. Hulk Hogan will probably make his return around this time. <br /> <br />World Heavyweight Championship <br />Triple H(c) vs. Batista- Batista Wins <br /> <br />WWE Championship <br />JBL(c) vs. John Cena (This might be changed to The Rock)-Cena Wins? <br /> <br />Big Show vs. Akebono- Akebono Wins <br /> <br />Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle- Shawn Michaels Wins <br /> <br />Undertaker & Kane vs. Gene Snitsky & Heidenreich- Kane & Taker Win <br /> <br />Ultimate Submission Match <br />Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit- Jericho Wins <br /> <br />WWE Tag Team Championship- Fatal 4 Way Match <br />Basham Brothers(c) vs. Jindrak & Reigns vs. RVD & Mysterio vs. The Dudley Boyz (returning)- Dudley's Win <br /> <br />World Tag Team Championship- Flag Match <br />Tajiri & William Regal(c) vs. La Resistance- Tajiri & Regal Win <br /> <br />Women's Championship <br />Trish(c) vs. Lita- Lita Wins <br /> <br />*There will probably be another match made like a Cruiserweight Title Match.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has really made a comeback, not just for themselves but for punk, with this album. No matter your politics, you'll love this disk if rock, punk or otherwise, is your deal. Go for it, yo. Do NOT be an American Idiot. Buy this disk!
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Since a web search will give you many details about both the performance and the sound quality, I will give you merely a  summary. <br /> <br />This is simply one of the best classical music releases of all time.   I don't say that lightly, as a classical music fan and audiophile for over 35 years. <br /> <br />It has been recognized for even longer, that this is one of the finest and most emotionally satisfying performances of romantic period classical music, and likely the definitive performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade.   (And, in my opinion, contains the best oboe performance in classical music.) <br /> <br />It has also been widely recognized as one of the best recordings ever of an orchestra, the highly sought after original LP usually residing in the list of top recordings in many audiophile magazines.   More recently, it has been pressed on LP by two different audiophile companies. <br /> <br />However, these days most of us don't want to go to the trouble of dealing with LPs, and it is generally recognized that the relatively early CD format, while having great convenience, did not quite provide the full sound quality present in a top LP playback setup. <br /> <br />Recently, this situation has been remedied by the introduction of two \\"high resolution\\" disc formats that give all the sound quality of a top LP playback setup in an affordable player compatible with DVDs and CDs as well.   These two formats are \\"DVD-Audio\\" and \\"SACD\\". <br /> <br />SACD has become the format of choice for classical music fans, and so RCA (now BMG) chose to re-release all their excellent sounding \\"Living Stereo\\" series recordings on SACD.   Back in the 50's and 60's, producer Richard Mohr and engineer Lewis Layton literally invented stereo recording in a celebrated series of brilliant releases. <br /> <br />Fritz Reiner's outstanding \\"Scheherazade\\" was recently released in the second batch of ten Living Stereo SACDs.    This SACD mastering went back to the original 3-track tape and presents it as original recorded in Left, Center and Right with no mixing or processing, whatsoever.   The result is as close to the original sound of Orchestra Hall as your loudspeakers and room acoustics can provide. <br /> <br />When you add in the factor that this is a budget-priced release, it is a must-buy for any classical music fan who has a SACD player and likes the romantic period. <br /> <br />And, while I have not yet auditioned the non-SACD CD-compatible layer (mixed to stereo), nor have I compared it to the previous regular CD release of this recording, nevertheless I can certainly recommend it even to someone without an SACD player, if they are looking for a great performance of \\"Scheherazade\\".
B000002J1L|4.0|This is the kind of CD that makes me wish Amazon had a different rating system.  This is a wonderful record and I enjoy playing it on a regular basis, but this can't rate 5 stars if 5 is all you can give all-time classics like The Lamb Lies Down on B-way or Selling England by the Pound.  Therefore by giving it 4 stars, what I mean is that this is a terrific early-prog album from Genesis but not as great as the above-mentioned albums or Foxtrot.<br /><br />After their baroque-pop debut and the transitional Trespass, Nursery Cryme was Genesis' first full-fledged dive into the prog-rock movement that was all the rage in 1971.  This is also the first of an amazing run of releases throughout the 70's.  The band perfected their art on the following record, Foxtrot, but Nursery Cryme has plenty to make it essential.  For starters is \\"The Musical Box,\\" which I think of as the very definition of symphonic prog, complete with Steve Hackett's straight-out-of-a-symphony guitar lead at the end.<br /><br />\\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" is my favorite song on Nursery Cryme, from Peter Gabriel's excellent vocals to the genuinely hard-rocking parts, this one is a classic of the prog genre and has more grit than most people think of with Genesis.  The closing \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" is another early classic and shows off the band's growing instrumental skills.  Peter Gabriel's lyrics and vocals at the time were based around the idea of writing lyrics in different \\"voices\\" and singing them \\"in character.\\"  Gabriel was quite effective at doing this and it gave the band a distinctive edge.  Tony Banks was growing into his role as one of the great prog keyboardists and using new sounds like mellotron and early synths.  Mike Rutherford was a dual threat on his signature double-necked bass/12-string guitar.  Phil Collins didn't get the props of some of his contemporaries, but he was quite a good prog drummer in his day, I saw him play drums several times in the early 80's with Genesis and Robert Plant and he really was good.<br /><br />This album has that muddy sound that many 70's albums had, and studio editing wasn't what it is now, although the remaster does help a bit from what I remember of the old vinyl.  And lastly, fans of this stuff who have a self-depracating sense of humor have to check out David Lynch's piece on Genesis at Progreviews.com - hilarious even if you disagree!ant and he really was good.

B000660UN0|5.0|First of all I thought the Me and Mr. Johnson album was good. I could hear alot of the nuances of Robert Johnson's originals and I could appreciate the tight Muddy Waters ensemble-like playing. At the same time I could understand some of the disappointment expressed by many reviewers. There was something missing that was hard to put your finger on. Maybe it was a little too reverent and I don't think Jerry Portnoy's harmonica added anything to the mix. I also read that the first record grew out of session breaks while the band was working on Clapton's next album of original material and it sounds that way at times, like making a Robert Johnson album wasn't really the original plan. But this new release is far superior and it would be a shame if it was overlooked either because fans are disappointed with the first record or the record company doesn't market it well. The whole band sounds more at home and relaxed with the material on this new record, like they've had a chance to digest it for awhile. Nothing sounds forced. Clapton's vocals sound like he's been singing Milkcow Calf's Blues and Little Queen of Spades all his life, and his guitar playing is more intense and out front but still not overdone which I think is appropriate for RJ's music. The overall sound is also much better, no distortion and better separation. For instance you can clearly hear both Eric's and Doyle's slide parts on Milkcow Calf's Blues as well as the faintest acoustic slide notes at the end of Ramblin' On My Mind. Anyway if you're debating which Clapton RJ release to pick up, Sessions for Robert J gets the nod. Even if you already have Me and Mr. Johnson the DVD alone on this set makes it a worthwhile purchase and there are some great tracks on the second CD that were not on the first release. Enjoy
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I found myself snickering a lot during this movie - not so much laughing out loud. It has a real subtle style, some might even call it bland, it's not for everyone. Napoleon is the guy you either ignored or beat up in high school (or you were him) - he tells tall tales of his prowess with a bow staff! His pasty-skinned brother, an uncle stuck in his own past glory days and the shy girl with a crush are all perfectly crafted as well. My favorite scenes were when Napoleon drew the picture of the girl he wanted to take to the dance for her and his note was like 'there's plenty more where this came from' and the drawing is the most grotesque, childish likeness of the girl. Then when Pedro is running for class president, Napoleon gives a nerd getting bullied a boondoggle keychain and says 'Pedro offers you his protection', then when the school bully tries to take the kid's bike, Pedro's cousins in the low rider come by. There are lots of great little moments, mostly when Napoleon is in his own little, oblivious world of Ligers and whatnot.
B000286RNY|3.0|My impression of this movie was not a comedy, but interesting, like pictures of space from NASA.  If you have ever fantasied about the ultimate sports team, this movie hits the target.  Some scenes are ridiculous --- launching a soccer ball with cannon force from one's abdomen.  I wished for more \\"real\\" martial arts mixed with soccer, but the extemes have a place in such a movie/fantasy.  The children and I both enjoyed the movie, but after watching it twice, we skip all the talk and watch only the training and soccer scenes.
B00022XOAO|5.0|Carlos Kleiber has always been fascinating in Beethoven (as in most of the selective repertoire he used to play). This unique document of the Pastorale, taped live in Munich in 1983 (according to the liner notes the only time Kleiber performed this symphony), is no exception. His account is fluid, urgent, feverish, dazzling even, and is sure to keep one spellbound long after the performance is finished (just as the audience seemed to have been during the actual concert), as if a work deemed familiar was really heard for the very first time.    Since the original master tape was in poor condition, the producers of this CD preferred to use the audio cassette made by Kleiber's son. Although carefully mastered there is quite some tape hiss left. Another minus is undoubtedly the short total time (39 minutes). Yet no admirer of Kleiber or Beethoven's Pastorale should be without this CD.
0812932293|5.0|Unlike most people whose exposure to Richard Branson came from his reality show, I bought this book after reading one of the Forbes \\"Richest People\\" lists. I was intrigued by a man who could make a few billion dollars, jump out of planes, set record after record, cross-dress for promotions, and still remain a respected businessperson! <br /> <br />This autobiography covers Richard's life until around 1993, and the epilogue very briefly goes to 1997. Thus, there is no discussion about the impact of the internet on Virgin, or how the dot-com bust affected them, and so on. However, everything else until that time is very detailed and interesting. <br /> <br />Reading this book, you will learn the challenges that Branson had to overcome in his youth, including dyslexia. You'll learn how he started a vastly successful magazine while still in school, all the gritty details that involved in operating it, and how he progressed to record shops, record label, mega shops, airline, and eventually his Virgin empire. Exploits in his professional and personal life are also revealed, including his many world records and how he broke them, his numerous relationships, and the historic case against British Airways. <br /> <br />Make no mistake: Richard makes sure to put a happy face on Virgin and to promote his brand as much as possible. Then again, I don't know of a single book written by the founder of any such company - especially one that deals mainly with consumers - that does not \\"toot\\" its own horn on every other page.  <br /> <br />Regardless, this is a great book of a great man by a great leader. Whether you are an accomplished businessman, a student, or a bystander looking to learn more about Branson and Virgin, this book is worth purchasing!
B000002KDX|5.0|Acoustic music can often be seen as soft, quiet, and not very powerful...  America has proven this wrong! <br />This album is great for just mellowing at home (something I do an awful lot), smoking a cigar (which I only occasionally do), or just relieving some stupid stress.   <br />Out of all the songs on the album, I would have to say my two favorites are \\"Sandman\\" and \\"I Need You\\".  Sandman has a great hard acoustic solo, which is great when turned up at relatively high volume.  I Need You is simple, yet powerful and just makes you feel good. <br />The question is, would America work in this generation?  Most of today's music is so consumed with plastic skirts, over-the-top production scenes, and shiny flesh.  America is, in its own way, raw and unselfish.  Most of today's groups and solo 'artists' strive to be great and to bare their souls, but fail to do so because they get involved in endless drama with other misguided 'artists' and actors, and they end up appearing in magazines like 'Girl', and 'Entertainment'...oh, yes, let's not forget 'National Enquirer', where they end up next to the 1,000 lb. elephantitis man and bat boy.   <br />America, on the other hand, self describes their own name: simple, yet powerful.  Their music is not 'loud' but soothing; not 'obnoxious and confusing' but clear as a crystal river.   <br />Don't get me wrong; I do enjoy some modern music, examples including Radiohead, some Slipknot, Tori Amos, and even Marilyn Manson (although I prefer to read him more than listen).  I like these bands because, while they are mainstream, they create a message that does not try to impress you or make you want to be a 'fan'..  actually, Slipknot's term for fan is maggot, which while sounds ugly, is great because someone who truly enjoys and understands the intent of a musician will become a small (or sometimes larger) part of that artist's creation and not just a fan who will rush out and buy an over-priced t-shirt, refrigerator magnet or even aposter.   <br />So, in overall response to my earlier question, America would work in this generation only on a certain level, which is the level that a band that does not want, or need, millions of stupid fans or money, but merely a band who wants to create something so beautiful and knowing that that music becomes a real part of the listener's life without selling out their soul.  This is what great music is all about. <br />All you other maggots, and makers of maggots, yes, you, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, N*Sync, and my God shall I actually say Puff Daddy (or P. Diddy) and/or Chingy, get out of town and let the real music makers do their thing for the beauty and creation of the world!
0714843377|1.0|This isn't a book, but a collection of vague ideas, in huge font, aimed towards those in the advertising/marketing field. Of course, this isn't evident from the blurb or the title, misleading one into thinking that it is a motivational book for all.  <br /> <br />The ideas are few, haphazardly linked, and the message simple and obvious. You may find use in this if you are in the above line of work, but even then, I think there are much better books on the subject than this.
B000001F9E|5.0|If you're thinking about getting into Thin Lizzy, chances are you'll probably start either with this one or the Best Of compilation.  I despise Best Ofs and Greatest Hits cds coz they screw the listener out of most of the band's good songs, while the buyer thinks they own the only songs from that band worth owning.  So I can't suggest that, but Jailbreak for sure.  It's the one Thin Lizzy album you're most likely to find in a record store.  That in itself is a pity coz they have so many good albums.  Jailbreak is Lizzy's most popular album like Rush's Moving Pictures or Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon.  And like those albums, it is good....very good.  You want some highly original 70s hard rock that'll smack you in the chops and kick you right square in the ass?  Jailbreak's just what the doctor ordered and very decently priced as well.  Yes, this is the album with their hit, \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\".  According to your personal music taste this could be a good or bad thing.  Some of you folks probably steered clear of Lizzy because you hated that song, or were sick of hearing it.  Well, if you're really into this kind of music, you should know by now that a band's biggest hit is never close to being their best song.  There are some awesome songs to be found here.  If you wanna hear the beginnings of that dual guitar sound that Iron Maiden made so popular, check this out for sure.  Lizzy were basically the creators of that sound.  In my opinion there are no bad tracks on Jailbreak at all, and there's no reason at all why you shouldn't own this if you like 70s rock.  Warning!  You may get hooked and wonder, \\"why the hell didn't I buy this sooner?\\"  If you really have to you can always just skip \\"Boys\\" when it comes on.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I've just watched this film. What do I think? How do I feel? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm too shaken by the graphic depiction of Christs death to form an opinion at the moment. Maybe the torture scenes have rendered me incapable of giving the film a mark out of 5. Perhaps I will have to let the sight of fat and skin hanging from his side, fade from my memory before I can give a coherent review. <br />Surprisingly, I didn't cry tonight. Maybe my sorrow will manifest itslef in the morning or maybe in my dreams tonight.  <br />I guess I feel the way one would, after they had lost a loved one. Perhaps I'm thirsting for a greater sense of victory after the cruxifixtion, a more splendid ressurection. But then that's just me. I don't think this film is for me at all, but for those who have yet to know him. <br />One thing I do know is that, Jesus did indeed suffer the death so graphically depicted in the film and I applaud Mel Gibson's passion for preserving the authenticity and historicity of the times and events. <br /> <br />One can't be expected to leave the theatre with admiration for the acting or the cinematography. Neither would the sound track or costumes cause viewers to marvel - as excellent as they were. No all these things are eclipsed by the 'Message' of the film. <br />My hope is that , what happened in the film gives rise to the more important question of WHY it happened and many more people experience the rich and fulfilling life true Christianity brings.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I love Led Zeppelin. I have all the Official releases of LZ, both DVD and Boxed Sets, Live recordings. Also have some bootlegs of Zeppelin (over 40 to be precise) many are audience recordings, superb audience records, dry soundboards and excellent soundboards of their best performances through the years. Also have all the authorized or official discography (The essential, because I stopped to buy compilations from the Hendrix Family that claimed to have unreleased tracks that appeared on other released materials from them) of Jimi Hendrix and The recommended Live and compilations albums of The Who. <br /> <br />People often to watch Jimmy Hendrix at concerts to see and hear what Jimmy will do that day or night with his guitar. Would he burn his guitar and smash the amps after the star spangled banner? Sadly, no performance of himself was performed with confidence. He was shy and nervous time by time. But there are great performances of him out there. Too little time to wasted such great talent, but I think that he couldn't be such a great guitar player through the 70's. His over-overdosin of drugs was burning his neurons and creativity was lost. I really enjoy him from 66-68...  <br /> <br />The Who was a really great live band... but sadly only 2 Live albums are recomended to Who and non Who fans. Live At Leeds is just a perfect performance, better than a studio live take. It's just perfect. Isle of Wight, well... a memorable concert, but not great. I don't know any bootleg of the who that claims to be better than those two releases. I've been looking for it, but did not found one. <br /> <br />But Led Zeppelin is another story. Great live acts. Just check out The Song Remains The Same (Soundtrack). It is not their best, but is great. The sound is great, the performance is good, and the mix is far better than the Motion picture. Sadly, the motion picture is not a live concert, but 3 concerts cutted-and-pasted to present the \\"best\\" (according to Page). I've heard great performances of Zeppelin in bootlegs. Great Audience recordings that are clear and even better than some soundboard recordgins. Awesome performances. Also I heard unbelievable cristal soundboard recordings of AWESOME live concerts of Zeppelin. I say Led Zeppelin has at least 20 more Soundboard concerts that needs to be oficially released, not to move away this \\"How the West Was Won\\" concert, but to strength the Zeppelin Mania and provide more than \\"enought\\" artistic document to the fans and to the history of music. Some complete concerts that undoubtely deserves to be published are COMPLETE: Madison Square Garden (1975), Earls Court 1975, LA Forum material from 1977 (they played almost 4 or 5 days  in only a week, and one of the shows Keith Moon joined John Bonham on drums), and more Knebworth 1979. <br /> <br />For this release, I must say that, in 1972, Led Zeppelin performed a lot of their greatest and best performances ever. I can compare this 2 shows with the Australia, Japan, and Seattle bootlegs, and this is their best performance for the 72 tour. The other bootleg shows present their explosive and hardest performances, but sadly, sound quality of these shows are not their best. I bet that Page doesn't have Soundboard tapes of those shows, or they are horribly bad sounding. If you watch the Sydney footage in the Led Zeppelin DVD, the song played is a bootleg source. <br /> <br />This material of HTWWW has survived 30 years in a vault where some people entered and stealed soundboard recordings, outtakes, and other media where not carefully treated through years. <br /> <br />Jimmy has more Zeppelin material, but I bet he will not released any other material of Zeppelin. He is old, and he will not wait another 30, 20 or even 10 years to release any other material. This is the LAST thing we will hear to be officially released by Page. <br /> <br />As a gift of Led Zeppelin to fans, please yourself hearing again and again something you would wish to be theirand something your generations will learn from music, from rock, from Led Zeppelin, the greatest rocking live band ever.
B00000GAIW|5.0|To call Jethro Tull's 1971 opus \\"Aqualung\\" a \\"classic,\\" a \\"landmark,\\" a \\"masterpiece,\\" etc., etc., is an understatement. Tull's legendary fourth album remains an FM-radio staple to this very day, the band's most popular, enduring album by far (though other great Tull releases like \\"Thick As A Brick,\\" \\"Stand Up,\\" \\"Benefit\\" and \\"A Passion Play\\" all have their share of supporters for #1 Tull album ever). But without question, \\"Aqualung\\" is Jethro Tull's Big One, the album that launched them into the arena-rock stratosphere. However, it must be said that \\"Aqualung\\" is NOT the \\"concept album\\" that it is so often mistaken for. Tull leader Ian Anderson wrote some outstanding songs here dealing with themes of religion and childhood, but these songs don't tell any kind of *story*, per se, and although the character of Aqualung is mentioned in the first two songs---the title song and \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\"---we don't hear about him again for the rest of the album. So, no, \\"Aqualung\\" is not a concept album, in my opinion. But what \\"Aqualung\\" most definitely IS is a bonafied Jethro Tull masterwork, and one of the greatest classic rock albums ever made. Who *hasn't* heard the signature title song, with that famous six-note guitar riff from Martin Barre that kicks it off (deer-neer-neer-neer-NEER-neer!), followed by Anderson singing about that old geezer \\"sitting on a park bench\\"? It's a classic, signature Tull rocker. And, of course, one classic, signature Tull rocker deserves another, so feast your ears also on the second track, \\"Cross-Eyed Mary.\\" That totally rocks, too. This is followed by a trio of softer, acoustic songs, \\"Cheap Day Return,\\" the concert fave \\"Mother Goose,\\" and \\"Wond'ring Aloud,\\" all outstanding. Then Ian & company move back into rocking mode with the passionate \\"Up To Me,\\" \\"My God,\\" and \\"Hymn 43\\" (with the classic tongue-in-cheek line, \\"If Jesus saves, then he'd better save himself\\"). After the light acoustic interlude of \\"Slipstream\\" comes another ferocious Tull rocker & concert staple, \\"Locomotive Breath.\\" Finally, the band wind things down with Ian's tale of growing up, \\"Wind Up,\\" ending this classic album perfectly. Anderson's songwriting is superb, his vocals quite passionate, his flute & guitar work, as always, supreme. Martin Barre wields his axe like the master he is, decorating the album with glorious guitar riffs & solos, new bassist Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond is excellent, John Evan's thumping piano & keyboard-playing is awesome, and drummer Clive Bunker takes his exit from Jethro Tull on a very high note with some of the very best drumming he ever laid down with the band.Is \\"Aqualung\\" truly the greatest album Jethro Tull have ever made? My personal favorite Tull album remains \\"A Passion Play,\\" but to many, many fans, \\"Aqualung\\" is the champ, and that's fine with me. I love \\"Aqualung,\\" too. It's without question one of the band's Top Five best albums ever, no doubt about that. AND it's the perfect album to start your Jethro Tull collection with. Hail, Aqualung!
B000002JSR|4.0|Coda (1982.), Led Zeppelin's ninth studio album<br /><br />This album, it is true to say, is a nice extra addition to a serious Led Zeppelin fan's collection. By no means should this album be bought by anyone who has not listened to Led Zeppelin that much as it could give the great band a diminished impression to a new listeners ears, however, Led Zeppelin fans will be all to pleased to own a copy of this, the reject album.<br /><br />The album has some very good points. The tracks on the album are all very good, bashed out with loads of passion and, even if they probably will never get inot your top 10 Led Zep songs, they are a good listen. The album kicks off well with 'We're gonna groove' a short garage style rocker bashed out in style and is followed up by 'Poor Tom', a remnant from the 1970 Led Zep III recording sessions. However, 'I Can't Quit You Baby' performed live at an Albert Hall rehersal. I'm not knocking the track, its brilliant but it does not seem completely necessary a second time around (its originally on Led Zep I). Following this are Walter's Walk, Ozone Baby and Darlene, all good hard rock tracks, the first being a Houses of the Holy remnant and the latter two being from the In Through the Out Door sessions (in fact I think those two tracks would have done well on the album instead of tracks like the oversynthesized Corouselambra which bring down the albums overall standing .... but clearly the omission of these tracks must have seemed the right way to go at the time. Following this is Bonzo's Montreux, recorded in Switzerland in 1976. This is a great tribute to the great drummer. The final track, 'Wearing and Tearing' is a great finish to the album, again another track which you think would have served well on In Through the Out Door....<br /><br />So, not bad for a bunch of rejects ay. My real misgivings with the albums is 1) the time length, 33 minutes is way too short. It would be nice to see maybe 'Travelling Riverside Blues' and 'That Girl She Got Long Black Wavy Hair' from the BBC sessions added on here, to give the album more depth. 2) My other misgiving is the inside cover, which shows photos of the band. This is good in memorabilia terms but gives the album an impression of being a 'best of Zeppelin' to an unsuspecting listener. These misgivings aside, I would say buy this album but only when your familiar with ALL of Led Zeppelin's 8 studio albums as this is only really an addition. However, don't knock the tracks as they are very good for castoffs.<br /><br />So, 1982's Coda was the end of the road in terms of Led Zeppelin studio albums. Below is the order I would put them in based on how good I think they are:<br /><br />1. Houses of the Holy<br />2. Physical Graffiti<br />3. Led Zeppelin IV (Zoso)<br />4. Presence<br />5. Led Zeppelin I<br />6. Led Zeppelin II<br />7. Led Zeppelin III<br />8. In Through the Out Door<br />9. Coda<br /><br />In my opinion, the first 7 albums in that list are all classics in their own right. This is totally my opinion - many would say IV or Phys. Graf. are the best but Houses claims that honour in my mind. Also, below are what I would regard as Led Zeppelin's greatest 6 songs:<br /><br />1. The Rain Song (Houses of the Holy)<br />2. Dazed and Confused (Led Zep I)<br />3. Stairway to Heaven (Led Zep IV)<br />4. When the Levee Breaks (Led Zep IV)<br />5. No Quarter (Houses of the Holy)<br />6. Kashmir (Physical Graffiti)<br /><br />I needn't say no more!!Hair' from the BBC sessions added on here, to give the album more depth. 2) My other misgiving is the inside cover, which shows photos of the band.

B00003003S|1.0|I love Guns and Roses and i am still an objective music fan. This is by far, the worst live recording i have ever heard. Uninspired and a terrible mix. Take the soundtrack to the Use Your Illusion DVD's as being better than this. Obviously this was overdubbed to death without Slash, Izzy or Duff.
B000002H92|5.0|The sound quality of this CD is great. A lot of live albums fall short because the producers try to make the recordings sound like a studio album--all you hear is a stadium-esque roar at the end of each song that sits way back in the mix. What I love about this album is the same thing that I love about Frampton Comes Alive: the band is inspired, full of energy, and we can actually clearly hear individual people in the crowd yell and interact with the band. It gives one the impression that they're one step closer to actually being in the front row. You'll simply laugh at some of the things Morrison says to the crowd, and admire his incredible stage presence, which is felt all over this record. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like was the Back Door Man \\"medley.\\" I wish they would have played the whole song because the little they played sounded great. <br /> <br />You'll either love or hate the \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" portion of the first disc. It demonstrates the band's most uncommericial, though poetic, side. <br /> <br />It's also worth noting that a version of Gloria is on the second CD, though it sounds like it was recorded in the studio.

B00074CBMY|4.0|\\"Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth, you act like you never had love and want me to go without,\\" Joe sings on the opener \\"One.\\"  His vocals are certainly filled with heart & soul, an apt title for Cocker's work over the years.  It takes a great deal of talent to take a song that's known for another version and totally embody it, making it new.  Cocker does excellent work on this disc.  Some of his previous discs have been spotty, but when Cocker connects as he did with \\"Lie to Me\\" from \\"No Ordinary World\\" or \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\" and the title track from \\"Respect Yourself,\\" he's powerful, brilliant, and expressive like few others.  When he tackles the classic \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\" it moves with such a soulful grace that it becomes memorable.  Three tracks here are my very favorites.  On \\"Chain of Fools\\" Cocker smokes with Ray Brinker's crisp drums propelling the track and CJ Vanston's bass throbbing joyfully.  No one is ever going to forget that Aretha Franklin sang this classic song, except possibly while they're listening to Joe Cocker's version!  :)  On John Lennon's \\"Jealous Guy,\\" the arrangement may be a tad too playful for the lyric with CJ Vanston playing a barrelhouse style piano in the background, but Cocker thoroughly moves into Lennon's angst and polishes what is an excellent melody on what is arguably an underrated song in Lennon's catalog.  Leiber & Stoller's \\"I Keep Forgetting\\" has been recorded by David Bowie and Procol Harum.  Cocker takes the melody and makes it a soul anthem for any guy who's ever carried a torch for the girl that broke his heart.  Some of the tracks here are very good.  Joe balances the Lennon solo tune with Paul McCartney's joyful \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"  Steve Lukather's blazing electric solo on the track is certainly a showstopper, but perhaps a bit overpowering.  Cocker takes \\"Every Kind of People\\" penned by Andy Fraser (from the band Free) that is thematically sweet and builds into a joyful performance.  When James Taylor sang \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely,\\" he came across as a guy who was aching with loneliness and longing.  In Cocker's hands, it sounds like a guy who is deeply in love.  Overall, \\"Heart & Soul\\" is a strong outing for one of rock's most enduring vocalists.  Enjoy!n James Taylor sang \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely,\\" he came across as a guy who was aching with loneliness and longing.  In Cocker's hands, it sounds like a guy who is deeply in love.

0385510454|4.0|I haven't read a Grisham book since \\"The Brethren\\" <br /> <br />This book was fun!  The story is classic Grisham, with all the elements we see in previous books like The Firm, Pelican, etc.  Pehaps a bit more sparse in details about the characters, but good stuff. <br /> <br />By the time I was finished, as a side benefit, I was ready to take up learning another language.   <br /> <br />Worth the time. <br />
B000000H42|5.0|This album is a timeless classic - far and away the best Mercyful Fate album, and one of the better metal albums to be recorded in the early 80s.  The album seems truly composed, and not just hacked together, both musically and lyrically.  The guitar work is great; the parts are well thought-out and they actually take advantage of having two guitarists for more than the ususal \\"you play rhythm while I take the solo.\\"  The production is also very good for an album of this vintage (although it could be the remastering of this release). <br /> <br />In short, if you don't have this, and you enjoy good metal, you need it.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I admire Mark Knophler as a talented guitar player and songwriter.  Over the years, I have learned to appreciate that his vocal style fits in well with his music.<br /><br />On his recent Shangri La CD, Mark shows hints of his guitar brilliance and writes some interesting lyrics here and there.  Also, the atmosphere is quite captivating as it was on previous recordings.  However, the songs themselves are way too sluggish with barely a trace of energy.  In spite of some nice guitar embelleshments, there is not one cut loose edgy solo in this fourteen song batch.<br /><br />Furthermore, the overall tone of this CD is strongly lacking in the area of variety.  There is a minimum of keyboard touches and an overabundance of fokly acoustic guitar passages.  On Sailing To Philadelphia and The Rag Pickers Dream there were so many more instrumental touches and even a few world oriented sounds.<br /><br />Postcards From Paraguay is a slight diversion from the usual fare on Shangri La and is probably the most noteworthy track.  Boom Like That, Song For Sonny Liston, and Everybody Pays also seem to be fairly memorable.  Whereas the remaining tracks are not bad, they really do not distinguish themselves.<br /><br />I would recommend that the next time Mark Knophler records a solo CD that he include some more songs that are either fast paced and/or rock n roll oriented.  The atmospheric slow paced acoustic fare that over loads this Shangri La recording where pleasant can be a good antitdote for insomnia on a few too many cases.
B000067CQK|5.0|Some albums age gracefully. Some age badly. Some don't age at all. \\"The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars\\" is one of those albums that refuses to take on any signs of age. That an album that turned 30 years old sounds as perfect now as it did in 1972 is testament to its brilliance. If you're pondering this review, then it's likely you already know the highlights. But then again, I'm just as happy to toss my two cents as the next guy, right?<br /><br />To that extent, I am glad the bonus tracks are shifted to the second disc. The original album is a stand alone piece of work, and doesn't need to have extraneous half finished blueprints dangling off the end of it. Frankly, I've listened to the bonus material twice and likely won't again. (standouts are \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" and the new mix of \\"Moonage Daydream.\\") But as I have for several years (well, maybe more...), I'll be pulling disc one out plenty more times.<br /><br />Several others have mentioned the missing notes between \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Suffragette City.\\" They ARE on my disc, so it appears that current issues of the disc have been fixed. I also have no gripes about the package, I rather like the comments from both various artists about their impressions of Bowie/Ziggy and participants, like Ken Scott. David Bowie made \\"Ziggy\\" the album, but Ziggy Stardust also made Bowie. That influence carries through to the present day.

0312955006|5.0|Synopsis: Detective Harry Bosch of the LAPD shot and killed a suspected ritualistic serial killer in a controversial but \\"righteous shoot\\" several years before. Now, the killer's widow is suing the city for killing the wrong man and new victims of the serial killer are showing up - victims that definitely were killed after Bosch shot his man.<br /><br />First - let's address the title. There are actually two concrete blondes in the book. One is the concrete statue of lady justice outside the courtroom. The other is one of the victims - a blond prostitute/porn actress who was found encased in the concrete floor of a self-storage unit.<br /><br />Second - this is a great cop story. I won't go into much plot detail, but I will say that the story twists and turns in so many directions that it is hard to put down. Just when you think you have got it figured out, you find that Connelly has been waiting for you and your erroneous conclusions and he gleefully smashes them to pieces.<br /><br />This book almost caused me to be late to work two days in a row! I give this book an enthusiastic \\"A\\".
B00005JLEX|4.0|I enjoyed the series immensely, and the DVD set does have some great features. But, I find that the \\"notes about nothing\\" go across the screen so fast, it was impossible to read. I even slowed it down 8X, and they still flashed by too fast to read. Otherwise, I look forward to the next installment.
B00005JL2O|3.0|This latest installment in the Austin powers series is fairly decent at its best. The movie uses a lot of the same jokes from the last Austin Powers movie, and it doesn't even try to be original. The last two films always tried to raise to bar of comedy to new heights, but this one just gets by off the same jokes as before. It's still good for some laughs that'll entertain you, but I wouldn't expect too much out of it. I thought Mike Myers was still very hillarious in this film as the nefarious Dr. Evil, the heroic Austin Powers, the overweight Fat (...), and the new obscene Goldmember. Overall, it's still a good film to watch, but it's too bad it couldn't live up to its potential.
B000002KB8|5.0|When Black Sabbath unleashed this monster of a debut they also unleased the monster we all love and know as Heavy Metal! Never before were the guitars this heavy/low tuned and distorted, never before did the bass sound so sludgy. Go ahead try and name a heavy metal band that wasnt influenced by Black Sabbath, thats right you cant!<br /><br />The album opens up with one of Black Sabbaths best known songs, 'Black Sabbath' this is the darkest, heaviest, and scariest song you have ever heard in your life. \\"Whats that, oh please God help me!\\" now that is a lyric! The guitar riff at the end of the song is one of the all time greatest. Next is 'Wizard' which has the harmonica if you can bealive it. Its almost bluesy the bass line is killer and the drumming is over the top. Some of Tony Iommi's best guitar playing can be heard on this song. Listen to this track and try and tell me he is not one of the best players ever! 'WASP' is just kind of a intro into 'Behind The Wall Of Sleep' which has an awesome guitar riff and Ozzy's voice sounds almost perfect on this track and the anti-war lyrics are great as  well. 'BASSicaly' is vassicaly just a long bass solo by Geezer and its probley the best thing he ever player. I take that back the best thing he ever played was the bass line to 'N.I.B.'  after the bass line the drums kick and and Tony enters with another amazing guitar riff as only he could create. 'Whicked World' is my favorite song on the album because it has Bill Wards all time greatest drumming, and Tony Iommi play some of the most amazing guitar of his 30+ year carear. Ozzy almost sounds like Ian Anderson on this one. Next is the Medly 'Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning' Bit of Finger gets its name from the accedent that cut off the tips of Iommis fingers just before the album was recorded. Once again amazing Guitar solos powerful lyrics and Vocals and a rythem section that was never topped.<br /><br />Black Sabbath is Black Sabbaths all time best album, yes even better then Paraoid. Do yourself a favor and get this legendary album!ven better then Paraoid. Do yourself a favor and get this legendary album!

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I just had to get on here and write in my two cents on this hilarious movie. I am not exactly a teenager--but watching this made it all come back full-force--and I couldn't have laughed any harder.  I love Napoleon because he is just so strange.  Everything about him--he's weirder than most nerds--and the other characters are priceless--the puny older brother and the on-line babe he links up with; the llama in the backyard--the motorcycle grand ma-- I also loved the odd little extras (ie: \\"The Happy Hands Club\\"??) Jared Hess--you're a genius. Thank you for making me laugh--and yes--I will \\"vote for Pedro\\" ! I so recommend this hilarious movie.
B00003CY5J|5.0|This is one of De Niro's BETTER films of recent years.<br /><br />He plays an aging career criminal thief vowing to quit after one last Score...He hooks up with Ed Norton and Marlon Brando to work out all the details..Ed Norton is superb in his portrayal as his sidekick who demands the respect of veteran thief, DeNiro. When DeNiro first meets him, he doesn't want to give him the time of day but quickly realizes how passionate he is about the Score they are about to take. DeNiro's character reminds me of the character he played in Heat...well disciplined and dedicated...Not a lot of violence in this one...but more dialogue...Still, this film is able to hold your attention till the very end and a very good ending it is...Great chemistry with these three actors...I liked it a lot.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This has got to be one of Pat Metheny's best albums. It is one great big concept, one BIG GRANDIOSE CONCERTO. It plays out like a great opera-conceptual concert piece. It's going back to \\"As Fall Wichita...\\", but more like \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" by Yes, or \\"Suppers Ready\\" by Genesis. The classic Methenyesque sound is all over the place, but there are new things like a major and more integrated participation on trumpet by Coung Vu, to name one. New member Gregoire Maret's harmonica is outstanding (like Toots on Secret Story all over again + more). This PMG lineup promises to be the best. It does take repeated listenings to get into it, and it would be difficult to appreciate the full scope of it if you take it apart. But the best thing is how Pat and Lyle, with great artistic integrity, once again challenge us as listeners, to go into different and new sonic worlds. HIGHLY recommended.

This 1997 book won several awards, most notably the Pulitzer in 1998.  I was given this book by a grad student acquaintance in the Boston area, read it a half a dozen years ago.  At the time, I was also studying the book of Daniel reading about how the world's first empires came to be so by conquest, in Daniel's case, conquering the tribes of Israel and deporting some of the vanquished to Babylon.  This secular book added another dimension to my understanding of world history's dynamics in addition to a spiritual/prophetic one.  I loved this book because it helped explain a lot of things, made me think.<br /><br />I've always loved anthropology and this book builds on one of its tenets that societies' key to becoming complex ones was the development of agriculture.  With a permanent food supply, population numbers increased, societies increasingly diversified their occupations one of which was waging war.  In societies like Papua New Guinea, a small island near Australia, where Yali was a tribal chieftain, most of the inhabitants subsisted as hunter-gatherers not advancing to the next stage of developing agriculture.  So knowing that already, I was given a grander view of the advancement of societies by reading this book.  Although it's been years since I've read it, I still have the book, and learned many new things from Diamond's creative thinking.  As to where he got all of his intellectual cargo, he was born in Boston, probably the most book-buying state of the Union, to a physician father, linguistics teacher mother, and went to school at Harvard and Cambridge.  He now teaches Geography in addition to Physiology in California at UCLA.ll of his intellectual cargo, he was born in Boston, probably the most book-buying state of the Union, to a physician father, linguistics teacher mother, and went to school at Harvard and Cambridge.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|My friends raved to me about a movie they had seen over the weekend, it was \\"hilarious\\", this movie was Napoleon Dynamite. I went to Amazon.com to check the sales rank and reviews to discover there were few bad reviews so I thought I would give it a shot. The next weekend I watched the movie with a friend we both sat quietly watching the plotless film. It looked as if it had potential in the beginning, so we waited and waited for the plot to develop, only to discover there wasn't one. There is a reason the character Napoleon Dynamite doesn't get recognized in every day life because they are compulsive liars to make their boring lives seem worthwhile. This movie is a complete waste of time and I have no idea why so many people have actually purchased it. Save your money.

055357342X|5.0|\\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" did not strike the right cord with me right off the bat. But I came to admire the series after reading this book. I've been too much into reading fantasy by such authors as Jordan and Goodking. If you love those series, you may go through similar experiences as I did. <br /> <br />It took me almost 5 months to read this volume of the series. I often put it down and picked it up again. Finished it last night and almost could not sleep. A pot that has been boiling for a long time has finally burst.  <br /> <br />Martin writes fantasy that portrays people very realistically. There is no such thing as absolute truth in these books. It really depends on who you ask. That constituted my biggest problem with the series at first. Every protagonist is pursuing their own dreams and agenda. Furthermore, there always seems to be a cause that triggers a particular reaction. Incredibly, this book had me realize that Martin set up many causes almost 2000 pages before they caused a reaction. In a series this complicated, that's just mind stopping. Also the series gives you an excellent mix of characters that are pure pragmatics, and those who are torn between emotions and pragmatism. <br /> <br />Prepare yourself to be amazed and outraged by the deaths of many a main protagonist. Such is life.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|This is such a great movie. The plot is about self-proclaimed date doctor played by Will Smith who helps men who have a hard time meeting women. He seems to have all the answers until fate would have it. He meets the women of his dreams played by Eva Mendes. But the date doctor can't seem to do anything right. That when the laughs begins. But the real star of this movie is Kevin James who's totally clueless yet funny at the same time trying to win his dream girl. This is flat-funny and a real treasure.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Having listened to Spock's Beard, Transatlantic & Neal on his own I was very curious about his latest release.  It blew me away.  If only the Christian music market could listen to this; this is what it's all about.  Great lyrics and just great music.  But I'm sure the Christain market will just keep generating the same old stuff.  Too bad, but great for artists like Neal.  What isn't great about this cd, nothing.  It rocks and gives you insight into Neal's journey in becoming a Christian.  It has all the elemnts of prog but has enough there for the casual listener that just might stumble onto this.  I'm sure many fans of Neal won't care for the direction he has taken, but this doesn't mean he won't come back with more of a secular cd next time.  But you kind of had to expect this especially after listening to the two Transatlantic cd's and the 'Snow' cd from Spock's Beard.  Spiritiuality was running amuck in those so this was just a short step away.  Being a Christian myself I don't listen to too much Christian music because it doesn't have what secular music does and just not lyrically either. (I agree with dpmomberg's comments about this) Although I'm sure they're trying just look at this cd and you can see that they are not even up to this level yet.  Great CD.  Check It Out! You'll be glad that you did.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Surprising especially when you read Madonna's name on so many of the writing credits. This remastered version sounds INCREDIBLE, it is miles ahead of the original cd release sonically , and contains a few bonus tracks as well. This one STILL gets put on at our house parties, and it always pleases. There is something oddly comforting ( the nostalgia factor I suppose ) in this album, so many memories it brings back. So many people call this throw away, disposable pop , but I beg to differ. There are some really great songs here, tons of hooks, melodies and infectious grooves. Call me a pansy, I don't care, I just love Madonna's debut. It is a benchmark. The rebirth ( and re-acceptance ) of dance music started here, after years of the \\"Disco Sucks\\" backlash. A pleasure for the ears and the feet, over 20 years after its original release, it still inspires.
B000060P79|5.0|I loved \\"I'd Do Anything\\" when I first heard it as the theme song for that TV show on the WB and I love the rest of the CD just as much. The songs have the same feel, which I tend to like. This is a nonstop fun CD and it's great! If you like this CD, do check out Attila and the Huns ([...] they music is similar enough and very catchy!
B000002MFN|4.0|I'll make this brief....The first 10 songs on this disc are GREAT. The remainder are just awful. I think recording artists are inclined to put 70 minutes of music  on a cd because they CAN, not because they have enough really good material to do it. If this were a shorter cd ( like I said, the first ten songs are simply amazing ) it would be a 5 star effort, for sure. But some of the eclecticism seems forced ( the bits with the guest rappers, whoever they are, are just embarressing ), and it really runs out of steam 3/4 of the way through.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I've never been a real big Green Day fan before, but this CD is great! I've always got \\"Americal Idiot\\" or \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" stuck in my head and I can't say that I mind. The style of music is a great mix of upbeat and sarcastic, much like my fave band Attila and the Huns ([...] I would recommend this CD to all my friends!
006441034X|4.0|I wouldn't have encountered this novel if Hayao Miyazaki had not made it an animation film in Japan. But the story flows differently between the original story and the film. In the book you can expect a frightful but reassuring tale unfolded. Really a good yarn!<br /><br />At the very start of this story, Sophie Hatter is transformed into a 90 years old lady by the witch of the Waste. I couldn't understand why. This is really a good hook to lead the readers into the Diana Wynne Jones world of the sorcerers. But the real world is also woven into the story and connected with the Howl's castle. In the real world, Howl is Howell Jenkins, and the Howl's nephews are playing video games! I was really flabbergasted by this passage because I believed that the Howl's moving castle was drifting over the feudal world of kings and farmers in the Middle Ages.<br /><br />Howl is considered as a wicked sorcerer, but the reality is yet to be determined by reading the sequel of this book: A Castle in the Air!
6304712499|1.0|I went to see this film in the cinema with two friends back in 97. The best thing about the movie was the popcorn that they served at the cinema. I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. We ended up walking out about half way through the film.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I just got this album a week ago, and the main reason I bought it was because of boulevard of broken dreams.  That would be my number 1 song!  Anyways, I've never been with Green Day through the years, except just now.  I didn't like American Idiot on the radio and thought it was terrible.  Although I still bought it anyways.  It took me a day to get used to, but it really grew on me fast!  American Idiot instead of being the worst song I heard in the radio and mtv, is one of my favorites in the cd.  And like everyone else said, each track stands strong, ll of them are really good.  So take it from me, non-green day fans, if you do like their kind of music or any of their songs you heard, such as from this album, I highly recommend you to buy this!  Its definetly worth EVERY penny!  Now my favorites are!!! (order in track no. <br /> <br />1. American Idiot <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams <br />10. Letter Bomb <br />11.  Wake me up when September ends <br />13. Whatsername <br /> <br />Those are my top 5 for this album, and this album definetly is worth 5 stars!  So I do recommend you non Green Day fans and returning Green Day Fans to consider buying this!  You will NOT be disapointed!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Incredible, I can feel that Pat's has been able to progress through his life at composing, and it is true as he once said it. \\"Every thing that you do in terms of music, must be different from the previous one.\\" He sure has live to his word. A truly masterpiece.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This has got to be the best cd in the world!!!! The lyrics are very well oriented to our problems and issues today. But besides that, the songs are amazing!! My favourite is HOLIDAY. This cd is totally worth its weight in gold. If you're looking for an amazing cd buy this one.....now!
1573225517|5.0|Wow, never has a book spoken to me so much about the male perspective in relationships.   <br /> <br />The books opens with the main character, Rob a small record store owner, presenting a list of his top five memorable split-ups, which does not include being recently dumped by his girlfriend Laura for a dullard guy who lives above his apartment.  But we all can tell  this dumping really belongs at the top of his list.  And this is part of the beauty of the story.  The characters often do not state their feelings and intentions, but we can all see through them as the characters dance through the relationships they crave, but fear will lead to more pain.   <br /> <br />Another strength of the book is the humanity of the characters.  They certainly have their flaws, and do not make the best judgements at times.   Rob concedes how self-centered and insensitive he can be at times, and some of his conduct with Laura was absolutely disgraceful.    But he clearly has a compassionate side.  We find ourselves cheering for Rob, flawed as he is, as struggles to get Laura back, and find himself.    <br /> <br />While this sounds like a deep, psychological study, it's actually a hoot to read.  The understated British humor really works well with this material, and there's a great ensemble of supporting characters.  The dialog is wonderful, and it seems like light reading, but this most definitely is not. <br /> <br />As we all go through these experiences in our lives more than we care to admit, the book really spoke to me and men will likely identify with this more than women.  But it really speaks to a part of the human condition that everyone can identify with, in a highly entertaining way.
B00062IVKS|5.0|My first inclination is to wax rhapsodic about the extra features, which you can see listed in the editorial reviews and which I spent most of my day off devouring.  There's also a urge to talk about hearing the commentaries from all the principals.  And I could spend pages and pages going into the movie itself.    But words are cheap, in this case, and totally beside the point.  So, in short: This is an incredible motion picture representing a high water mark for the director, the screenwriters, the cinematographer, the editor and the entire cast.  It's a beautiful, harrowing experience and if you haven't seen it, I can't encourage you strongly enough to fix that.      The bottom line: \\"Raging Bull,\\" a great film and one of the best of the 80's and of the past half century, is -- after a long absence -- finally available in the format and presentation it deserves.  And that's an incredibly good thing.
B000268QB2|5.0|This album is brilliant and keane knows it and everybody knows it so there's no need to say it again!
0785701583|4.0|Did Roald Dahl go soft in his old age?    This book is every bit as entertaining as his earlier works, featuring a grand plan that unfolds nicely for the schemer. But there's no subversiveness, no violence, no disgusting bodily fluids or functions or anything of the kind. I quite liked it.     Esio Trot is the story of a man who is in love with the woman who lives beneath him. Every day, he pines for her as she fusses over the love of her life, a tortoise named Alfie. One day, he is struck with an idea as to how he can win her love-but he's going to need the tortoise to do it.    This is a gentle tale, but no less humorous than you would expect from Dahl. The feel-good nature is a pleasant change, and the idea of two older people courting has always been a source of warm fuzziness.    I highly recommend this entertaining and charming book. If you're a parent who is uncomfortable with letting your small child read some of his scarier books (a view I understand even if I don't agree with it), I especially recommend this story. With Esio Trot, you can let your child experience this magical author without having to worry about any objectionable bits.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|There is a CD out there called \\"The Best of George Harrison.\\"  Unfortunately, the compilation featured mostly Beatles songs, with a few hit singles tacked on at the end.  That is not a good way to make a George Harrison greatest hits compilation.  If you want George's real best, you want \\"Cloud Nine.\\"  The songs are incredible.  He rocks, he sings beautifully, and he plays guitar very well.  Tune into the Devil's Radio and you'll hear a full album of awesome material.  You'll be on cloud nine as you experience the magic of Beatlemania all over again.  Yes, George is still fab, and his music is better than ever.  After years out of the limelight, this is George's triumphant comeback.
B000003TB6|5.0|The Roots was one of the first bands to introduce me to hip hop and have continued to be some of my most listened to CD's.  \\"Do You Want More\\" is probably one of the best first albums to pick up.  As with most bands The Roots have explored their sound over the years and this album is one of their most experimental and artistic albums, the Bass and Drum lines are definately rooted in Jazz on this C.D.  Why I like this Album so much, and most of the Roots albums, is because they feel so alive.  This is Hip Hop at some of its finest!
B000007638|5.0|Being a big Beatles/Paul McCartney fan, I've bought several live Macca albums from the '90s to present day.  This includes \\"Paul is Live,\\" \\"Tripping the Live Fantastic,\\" and \\"Back in the US.\\"  Though they are all good CDs, nothing can compare to the 1976 tour, when Paul was just starting to get back on his feet.  The music is great, and the band rocks hard.  Wings broke up just a few years after this was recorded, but thank goodness they were together to give us this electrifying performance.  The opening medley of \\"Venus and Mars,\\" \\"Rock Show,\\" and \\"Jet\\" is killer, and other highlights are \\"Medicine Jar,\\" \\"Hi Hi Hi,\\" \\"Band on the Run\\" and \\"Let Me Roll It.\\"  This album rocks, start to finish.
B00005O5CM|4.0|This is a very funny movie. The first time my wife and I watched it we loved it. I recently bought the special edition for a great price. It has great replayability. The storyline is great and the music is fresh and upbeat. About time blondes got to chalk one up for all the dumb blonde jokes. Fans of movies like \\"Shallow Hal\\", \\"Deuce Bigalow\\", and \\"Shrek\\" will probably enjoy it. I highly recommend it if you need some comedy and empowerment when you are having a bad day.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is one of the few good merger bands. Taking Chris Cornell and throwing in Rage Against the Machine band members was a great idea. With this album, you get the same great riffs that Rage Against the Machine fans have come to expect, mixed with a different flavor of vocals. While the rapping vocals of RATM's Zach de la Rocha definitely will be missed, Chris Cornell pulls through with his awesome voice.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Let me just say right off that Ghost In the Shell 2: Innocence is a phenomenal movie, it deserves a solid 5 stars and should be held aloft as one of the greatest animes in history.  The problem here is the packaging and the subtitles.    There are two gigantic problems with the subtitles: (1) Why on Earth did they subtitle EVERYTHING?  Every time a plane flies overhead or a car door slams, it appears as a subtitle.  This is extremely frustrating and incredibly invasive.  There are times where you just want to scream at the localization company as you will completely lose track of the storyline (brutal as there is not a single disposable scene in this entire picture).    (2) Like the first Ghost In the Shell, many of the characters in the film can communicate to one another via transmissions from within their heads (think of it as a kind of \\"electronically-assisted ESP\\").  There are dozens of scenes where the subtitles will actually title the speaker for you.  For example, \\"[Batou] Understood, thank you.\\"  This would be terrific were it not for the fact that there are at least five or six times where the localization crew gets this completely wrong and credits another character.  Again, subtitles completely yank you right out of the mood of the picture.  Infuriating!    This film deserves the love and treatment granted to the original Ghost In the Shell DVD re-release.  Better packaging and a total overhaul of the subtitles is an absolute must.  I personally don't mind not having dubbing- I find it odd that anime fans would really complain about that.  But for the love of Gods everywhere, at least get the subtitles right and don't treat your audience like they are deaf.  It truly is for shame that a picture this revolutionary and this important would be given such a shoddy run.    North America also needs a soundtrack release!

B000002HMH|5.0|What I have noticed in every Metallica album since Load all the way up to St. Anger is that ALL of them are pretty decent albums. But, all of them take a lot of listening to appreciate. I have all the albums and my favorite one by FAR is Master of Puppets, NO questions asked. So when I first listened to Load I hated it. The only good songs at first were Ain't my Bitch, Until it Sleeps, King Nothing and Cure. I HATED Hero of the Day at first but, slowly but surely the song grew on me. Some of the other songs like 2 x 4, Poor Twisted Me, and Thorn Within didn't really appeal to me at first. So when I first bought the album and listened to it, I discarded it for the longest time. Finally I was bored so I decided to listen to the album again just to see what I would think, and I still didnt like it. Finally after listening to it a third time, SOME of the songs mentioned above I started to nod my head to. Then listening to it a fourth time I actually started to really enjoy the album. Now I LOVE it! My point that all the newer Metallica albums like Load, Reload, Garage Inc. (1st album anyways) and St. Anger (S and M doesnt count), they all take a good 4 or 5 listens before you like it. They are easy to discard after the first listen, but you really need to give them a chance, and give it a good 4 or 5 listens and by then, if you still dont like it, sell it.
B00064MW6A|2.0|This film should have been better. It has a decent cast. Sharon Stone and Halle Berry are both good actresses. Benjamin Bratt is generally a bit of a stock good-guy type but he's always relaxed enough to be convincing. The plot is perfect comic book material (which means it's right over the top with its insidious nature) and the 'look' given to the film is just larger enough than life to blend real with surreal.<br /><br />The problems start when the actors open their mouths. Benjamin Bratt is around to serve as a love interest, period. His job is to look good and smile or grimace at the right times. Sharon Stone's character has no depth at all. It just hisses (or coos patronizingly) according to the demands of the script. Lambert Wilson's character presents the face of corporate arrogance and nothing else. Both characters have no depth whatsoever. All they do is portray irredeemable evil that's varied only by gender code.<br /><br />Halle Berry fares only slightly better. She makes an alluring Catwoman and a demure figure as the character's alter ego but her role is severely limited as well. One side is soft and the other is hard. With only a few exceptions there's no middle ground in her character's duality. This has to be a studio decision. Writer Theresa Rebeck (Law and Order) is a far better writer than this and both Stone and Berry are far better actresses as well. Whatever the reasons for the lack of depth given to the characters, the film suffers for it.<br /><br />The film has other problems as well. A lot of the CGI appears to have been done in haste. The lighting effects that can be generated in 3D rendering are just lacking here. It makes the CGI sequences look like the hi-tech cartoons that they are. The soundtrack tries too hard to be hip and (at times) distracts from the film as opposed to enhancing it. Too much of the story is entirely predictable and the silhouette that closes film is unintentionally funny because of the action that precedes it.<br /><br />Catwoman isn't a complete loss. Even with the problems it has the film is still easy enough to sit back and enjoy. Unfortunately, there's seldom a moment where it doesn't seem as if it could be a lot better.ete loss.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble's latest is one hot cd! The contemporary crooner starts off on a high note with the rousing show tunish \\"feeling good\\" by leslie bricusse(of the musical jekyll & hyde) & anthony newley. He has a great run with some popular standards like \\"you don't know me\\", \\"can't buy me love\\"(yes, the beatles), \\"i've got you under my skin\\". His \\"save the last dance for me\\" is a toe-tappin' tune standard with a rhumba tempo. He has a very good contemporary track that he co-wrote called \\"Home\\" which could be his first entry into the top 40 charts.  He is old las vegas, smoky lounges, and new millenium sophistication in his own original way...he is definitely not a sinatra or dean martin clone but is clearly influenced by those great crooners.
0060594888|4.0|On religious criticism: There have been some negative reviews here on the basis that Canfield's book endorses selfishness and consumerism.  I find this to be unfounded considering that Canfield never tells you WHAT you should want.  He simply asks you to list YOUR goals and desires, whatever they may be.  Sure, some people will want Porsches and million dollar bathrooms, but that reflects those readers--not Canfield's book.  In fact, several of the principles in the book are specifically about serving others.  Principle 61 is \\"Give More to Get More,\\" 62 is \\"Find a Way to Serve,\\" and 64 is \\"Empower Yourself by Empowering Others.\\"  It's also important to note that Canfield's audience is an international one with a huge diversity of cultures and traditions.  The principles are therefore best explained in ways that don't require adherence to any specific religion and which allow readers to incorporate their spiritual beliefs as they see fit.<br /><br />On the criticism that this book simply summarizes other people's ideas: there is some truth to this remark, but (1) that only increases the credibility of the principles, since other reputable authors obviously agree with them; (2) the reader greatly benefits from the way Canfield has organized all that material into a set of principles which work sequentially, so that each principle builds upon the last; and (3) you save money by having to buy only one book which has them all instead of having to buy several individually.  And Canfield not only clearly acknowledges the work of others when he references it, but openly recommends that his readers investigate those other works further.<br /><br />So unless someone points out some more valid drawbacks to the book, I would happily recommend \\"The Success Principles\\" to anyone interested in achieving a more fulfilling life--however they define it.
0786715103|4.0|Dallaire describes the detail and horror of his experience in Rawanda during the genocides of 1993-94 as a UN peacekeeping commander who is ill prepared and lacked even the rudiments needed to support his effort.  This work is an attempt at carthesis on his part, in hopes that in telling his story, from the role of the First World Nations and the UN to the horrific fate of millions, he would find some peace from his nightmares and guilt.  He is right on in his delivery and evaluation, to the distaste I'm sure of France, the U.S., the U.N. and Belgium particularly and the First World more generally.  These are the people (countries), it seems, who are far more deserving of both nightmares and guilt.  His genuine concern for humanity and for Rwanda, along with his repeated disappointments, work to destroy his trust in his fellow man and in the millitary machine that he is a part of.  Excellent book.  My only criticism lies in the difficulty I had in following some of the military jargon and thread of his sentence structure.  It's well worth the read, regardless.

B0006IIPIK|3.0|I fell in lust with Jolie when in my early 20's when I saw Hackers, when she was still a teen.  Well, she's all grown up now and I'm still a sucker for those eyes.  The movie is visually interesting, but really my only interest was seeing her in leather.  I was hoping she would be kidnapped and tied and maybe tormented a bit by the Asian femme fetale android.  But alas, that does not happen.  Even though she cornily attempts an English accent, Angela still has those deliciously gorgeous eyes.  Yeah I got a Jolie fetish.  Paltrow by the way ain't too bad either, but even though Jolie's scene is brief, she lights up the screen.

B00062IVKS|5.0|I waited years to replace by VHS copy of \\"Raging Bull\\" until a definitive edition came out on DVD.  The vanilla disc had been floating around for years even though in Britain a collector's edition was available.  I cannot add anything to what is common knowledge among film buffs that \\"Raging Bull\\" is a landmark American film and that Robert DeNiro as Jake LaMotta gives probably the most singularly towering performance that any actor has given in any role in screen history.  The question that begs to be asked is do the supplemental materials in this package add to the legend of this great film?  A resounding yes!  This edition ranks as one of the great packages of a classic film in a few years.  The documentaries that are included with the film take you from the genesis of this project to it's aftermath compelling us to consider this film's legendary status.  What I found interesting in these documentaries is the graciousness that director Martin Scorsese extends to not only the film's cast(Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty) but his technicians(editor Thelma Schoonmaker, cinematographer Michael Chapman, et al), insisting that the finished product was a true collaborative effort.  It's also interesting that Scorsese doubted his fitfulness for what turned out to be the crowning achievement of his illustrious career.  This collection also includes three commentary tracks.  I chose the joint one by Scorsese and Schoonmaker.  Not only is this track informative but Schoonmaker returns the complement to Scorsese, attributing her Oscar win to his vision.  To MGM I say well done.  Now if only Universal would get off the stick and release proper editions of \\"Casino\\" and \\"The Deer Hunter\\".
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I'm really going to catch you-know-what for this! I mean, after reading the sterling reviews for Mr. Bubles latest offering I can see that  I am, once again, in the minority. But at the risk of alienating an army of Michael Buble's loyal fan base I must say that I am perplexed as to the popularity of \\" Its Time \\" and this young singer. But before you hit that \\" was this review helpful to you \\" no button please hear me out.    Heres my point...releasing a disc of standards is a double edge sword. On one hand you are releasing a collection of songs that are, for the most part, extremely popular and tunes that everyone enjoys, to one degree or another. So theres a certain comfort in purchasing a disc where you are intimately acquainted with the material. But...comparisons are inevitable as well. In my ever growing music library I literally have dozens of renditions of the songs featured on this disc and by the supreme vocalists of the last century. That being the case having yet another version of \\" I've Got You Under My Skin \\" ( Sinatra anyone? ) or \\" Foggy Day \\" ( Ella, you are the best! ) is probably something I could do without. Nevertheless, anyone even vaguely familiar with the art of the popular song is aware how these tracks should be performed and while Mr. Buble does an admirable job theres little here that premier vocalists of days yonder would find particularly threatening. Nevertheless, Michael Buble does have a nice enough voice with just enough bass resonance to make these songs interesting but, sadly, that may not be enough. Some songs simply require the singer to have enough life experience in them to relay the each tracks haunting lyrics, therefore assuring the listener that the vocalists understand the songs meaning. And while Michael can most definitley sing I do get the odd sensation that he may not have fully experienced much of what life may teach us to fully comprehend what many of the popular songs are truly telling us.  Mr. Bubles mentor seemsto be the late, great Bobby Darin and while that is fine in itself there simply isn't enough here to grasp onto, vocally that is, to keep my interest. I know it sounds as though I am damning this artist with faint praise but that's not particularly true.     If this disc holds any real pleasures at all ( and it certainly does! ) it might very well be not necessarily in Mr. Bubles vocals but in each individual tracks sterling arranging/producing. Tommy Li Puma has done a remarkable job in making these cheastnuts sounds fresh and inviting and 'that' has been my greatest enjoyment when placing this on my cd player. Again, Michael is a competant vocalist and certanly knows his way around a song but with arrangments such as these I can't imagine that most singers might come across better then they might with a less talented producer. Mr. Bubles freshman disc with David Foster bears that out admirably! That cd eventually was donated to my local library. Still, as previously stated, there are some nice things here, \\" The More I See You \\" is just playful enough to keep it interesting, \\" Can't Buy Me Love \\" a big band/swinging arrangment of the Beatles track is fun and swinging to boot! \\" Quando, Quando \\" is a misstep that never seems to take off but everything here cannot be as one would like it. But again, the arrangements and the musicianship on this cd is not only wonderful but saves the disc from a certan amount of blase'.    Overall, its a nice enough disc but it sounds as though they were perhaps simply trying to add as many flavors as possible to make it as interesting as they could. The only problem with that of course is that is sounds somewhat contrived and geared more toward marketing then an artist who is attempting to put together the best songs available. Nevertheless, I will award it three and a half stars and look foward to Mr. Bubles next release. Here's hopeing that he leaves the arranging to Mr. Li Puma and continues his on-the-job-training in the art ofsinging the popular song. I wish him all the very best!
B00062IVKI|2.0|Every major director seems to have some sort of misfire in their resume.  \\"New York, New York\\" is director Martin Scorsese's.  It's not even an interesting one, more like a tedious exercise in self-indulgence.  Who in their right mind thought the thin story here warranted it's 2 hour, 43 minute length?  This film lacks anything remotely resembling flair, which is a first for any Scorsese film I've seen.  It's first portion is nearly deadly as Robert DeNiro's sax player awkwardly courts Liza Minnelli's big band singer.  It doesn't help that DeNiro's Jimmy Doyle has less charm than Travis Bickle.  Things get little better as the two main characters' career trajectories go in different directions and DeNiro's louse get's even more insufferable.  Things perk up a bit when Minnelli gets to shine without DeNiro in sight with the \\"Happy Endings\\" production number and her rendition of the now-famous title song.  Alas, the damage has already been done at this point.  Who said that a swing-era musical had to be such a bummer?  I watched the film's trailer prior to viewing the film and I didn't get good vibes.  If you're putting all your best stuff in the trailer and it stinks what does that portend for the movie?
B000060OFT|4.0|Ever since the tale of two star-cross'd lovers whose untimely deaths brought peace to their two feuding families was written by the Bard, I'm willing to bet that no one ever thought it would be told like this; the story is set in modern day Verona Beach, with the Montagues and the Capulets as warring business men/gangs, whose kinsmen carry guns rather than swords (although each gun has a different type of sword name carved into it, such as dagger, rapier, and longsword). <br />I won't spend too much time talking about the story, seeing as how most people reading this review know the story backwards and forwards. Basically, the Montagues and the Capulets are two families that have been locked in a bloody feud for so long that no one remembers who/what started the fighting. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the only son of Lord (or in the film, Ted) Montague (Brian Dennehy), while Juliet (Claire Danes) is Lord (Fulgencio) Capulet's (Paul Sorvino) only daughter. The two meet and it is love at first sight. The next day, Friar Lawrence (Pete Postlethwaite) marries the pair. Sadly, tragedy strikes and Romeo is banished from the city. The friar gives Juliet a special potion that puts her into such a deep sleep that everyone thinks that she's dead... even Romeo (due to a mix-up in the mail). Ok, I am going to \\"reveal\\" the ending, so for the one or two of you who don't know the ending, just skip ahead a few lines. So, distraught over the \\"death\\" of his one true love, Romeo buys a very potent poison so that he can be with his love in death. Juliet finds him next to her when she wakes up, and she kisses him, then stabs, or in this version, shoots herself. <br />I remember when this movie came out almost 10 years ago, and there was a lot of controversy over it due to the fact that people were taking such a beloved story and placing it in modern times while still keeping Shakespeare's original dialogue. Personally, I thought it was great as a kind of juxtaposition; it was interestingto see people in modern-day California speaking Shakespearian English. The cast, for the most part, was perfect. Dennehy and Sorvino were great in their roles as the family patriarchs, John Leguizamo was a perfect Tybalt (a very over-the-top performance for a very over-the-top character), and Postlethwaite's Friar Lawrence was my second favorite of the characters in this film. I've only seen this guy in a few movies, but he is definitely a great actor (and you have to give this movie props for using Kobyashi). Harold Perrineau, Jr. was a pretty good Mercutio, although the writers made his character a little bizarre for my tastes, but for the most part, he played Mercutio the way he should have been played. My favorite character though, was Juliet. Claire Danes is one of the few actresses who could pull off Juliet; Juliet is not supposed to be \\"hot\\", she is supposed to be \\"beautiful\\" (yes, there is a difference), and there aren't a lot of women in Hollywood who have the level of beauty that is required to play Juliet Capulet (I think that if this movie was made now, my Juliet of choice would be Scarlett Johansson, but even today, Danes could still pull off the part). Danes is also a great actress who successfully brought Juliet's innocence, passion, and love to the screen as few actresses can. And what can I say, she is BEAUTIFUL, so she definitely gets my vote for favorite. <br />However, there were a few people that I thought could have been cast better. One of them, sadly, was Romeo himself. In some of his movies that have come out lately, DiCaprio has proven he has talent (I thought he was perfect in the role of Frank Abagnale, Jr. in Catch Me If You Can), but I feel as if this was too early in his career to play a character such as Romeo Montague. Oh well. Also, I hated the Lady Capulet of the film, played by Diane Venora. She was shrill, and her voice kept slipping in and out of a southern accent (although maybe I'm biased because I hate that character so much). <br />Also, apparently, there were a lot of actors in this movie who would either go on to (somewhat) bigger things or become guest stars on popular shows. The list includes Jamie Kennedy (of the Jamie Kennedy Experiment), Harriet Samson Harris (Bebe Glazer on Frasier), Vincent Laresca (Hector Salazar on 24), and Jesse Bradford (who's been in some kids' movies). <br />The visuals of the movie were excellent, and the music seemed to accentuate the story. Another great aspect was the whole water theme that they used.  And I must say that the filmmakers really went the whole nine yards when making this movie.  Even the billboards were written in Shakespearian dialogue, and many of them had quotes from other plays by the Bard. <br />While some stuff was omitted (no big plot points of course, just some dialogue here and there), it is to be expected. However, one of the most famous lines wasn't used, which really surprised me. It was Juliet's famous \\"Oh happy dagger, this is your sheath!\\". I'm going to guess that it was because they don't use swords in the movie, they used guns. Although (another \\"spoiler\\"), Mercutio's gun was named dagger, so I thought that Romeo should have used his gun to avenge him when he killed Tybalt. Therefore, Romeo would still have it with him, and Juliet would use the \\"dagger\\" gun to kill herself. <br />There is one thing, though, that didn't translate well when the play is brought to our time.  I find it very hard to believe that such rich and materialistic people wouldn't have cell phones, which would have saved the lives of Romeo and Juliet.  I'm not complaining, because they needed to do it for the sake of the story, but as I said, it is a little hard to believe. <br />Ok, one last \\"spoiler\\". They changed the ending ever so slightly (yes, they both still die); if I remember correctly, in the original version, Romeo is dead before Juliet wakes up, so the last time they see each other alive is before Romeo leaves the city. In this version,just as Romeo takes the poison, Juliet wakes up and they see each other alive for the last time which (and my Shakespeare friends will probably kill me for saying this) I personally loved, and even before I saw this movie, I always thought would have been a cool ending (don't misinterpret this; I don't think I'm a better writer than Shakespeare). <br />This version is definitely not for everyone. Some people may not like it because they are Shakespeare scholars who feel as if the story has been corrupted, while others just may not get it. However, I would advise seeing this movie at least once. Personally, I found this movie to be a refreshing experience, and I really enjoyed it.
B00005JLT5|2.0|This movie seems to help propagate the myth the somehow life for Gentile Poles was basically the same before and after Nazi occupation.     Nothing could be further from the truth.   [...]  Six Million Polish Citizens Were Killed During the Holocaust of World War II.     Half of These Polish Citizens Were Non-Jews.     On August 22, 1939, a few days before the official start of World War II, Hitler authorized his commanders, with these infamous words, to kill \\"without pity or mercy, all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we obtain the living space [lebensraum] we need\\".     Heinrich Himmler echoed Hitler's decree:     \\"All Poles will disappear from the world.... It is essential that the great German people should consider it as its major task to destroy all Poles.\\"     Non-Jews of Polish descent suffered over 100,000 deaths at Auschwitz. The Germans forcibly deported approximately 2,000,000 Polish Gentiles into slave labor for the Third Reich. The Russians deported almost 1,700,000 Polish non-Jews to Siberia. Men, women and children were forced from their homes with no warning. Transferred in cattle cars in freezing weather, many died on the way. Polish children who possessed Aryan-looking characteristics were wrenched from their mother's arms and placed in German homes to be raised as Germans.     The story provides little hint of any of this.
140004281X|5.0|Alice Munro is a wonder and she has done it again with her latest book of short stories. The stories average about 35 pages in length on average but I finished each one feeling I had read and been captured and engrossed in an entire book. And in many cases, emotionally drained by the experience. <br /> <br />She writes about ordinary women at different times in their lives; not a great deal seems to happen, yet a great deal does happen. You are left feeling breathless at the arbitrariness of life, of fate and of chance. In other words, about life. It is so difficult to categorize her writing. She writes of women who are not worldly, not necessarily successful but she imbues her characters with the patina of \\"every woman\\". <br /> <br />Read and enjoy! <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|Make no mistake, John Legend is no lightweight. Regardless of what others say, he is the real thing. Except no other substitute. His pure raw emotion and vocal power are flawlessly put on display. John Legend is simply dynamic. This isn't the R&B fluff that you're used to. It's a classic experiment with modern innovation. I could play this CD over and over without tiring. The combination of Legend and West is distinct in itself. If you missed the concert on AOL, you should run and see it while it's still showing. With this album, John Legend proves why he should be moved to the head of the R&B class. Legend and Keys will compliment each other well on tour because they both have changed the R&B landscape forever. Don't miss out on this GREAT album.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00007BHOE|5.0|Now, I've seen my share of concerts... But no band can grasp, let alone match, the work and thought that goes into the sets and performances of Slipknot. Sometimes you see a concert where the band comes out, plays their piece, and leaves thousands of dollars richer. You can tell that what we have here is a band that seeks to please its maggots. <br /> <br />First, I must say the set was phenomenal... The band sort of captured their essence and strew it across the London stadium. All of the set is there for a reason, even if it be Sid's frequent little escapades, where he feels it necessary to leave his jockeying post and roam throughout the scaffolding and propsets... <br /> <br />The camera angles are everything you want them to be... With an added feature. This DVD actually allows you to see the concert through a band member of your choice's point of view, making the experience all the more interesting with every viewing. <br /> <br />The music... What to say about the music? It's Slipknot, people; you should know what to expect. The tracks blend the most precisely-timed and intricately-worked drumming and most intentionally diabolical guitar riffs to create a beautifully working piece of art. Included in the live performance are various rare tracks, including \\"Purity\\" and \\"Eeyore\\", both previously available only on the Digipak issue of Slipknot's self-titled album. <br /> <br />This is one of the few DVD's I have seen to date that actually include an interesting bonus disc... On disc two, there is minimal live footage (what is there is various clips from concerts displayed as videos), but the DVD makes up for what it lacks in quality. Never before could you find the animated \\"Wait and Bleed\\" video, let alone that for the Terry Date mix. This disc includes many other videos from the pre-\\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\\" era, including \\"Left Behind\\". Also included is the studio recording and solely audio \\"Purity\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this DVD completely broke the barriers of expectation with the sheer amount of work put into a live performance... Simply stunning.
B000000HSU|5.0|This is the ultimate hardcore album- punk rock and reggae made by jazz musicians from the ghettos of DC and Maryland.   <br /> <br />The gold of this album- tracks 9 through 16- is sandwiched between sloppy hardcore songs- good for what they are, especially Banned in DC, Right Brigade, and We Will Not.  However, the middle of the album is fukcing art.  Fearless Vampire Killers, the most hardcore song written by anybody, then slows down immediately for grade A dub, The Meek.   I roars back aided by Coptic Times- featuring a very jazzy base solo.  Sailing On is the bands best song, and the title track Rock For Light reveals the bands unique message, a refreshing relief from the depravity of the West Coast scene.  H.R.'s vocalizations are unbelievable on the intro to Rally Round Jah Throne.  Finally, At the Movies rips at the heart of society without whining or complaining; a sincere attempt to show the kids grim reality free from glamorization.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|Anyone who knows anything about me understands that I am the last person on earth to volunteer my money for a film under the dreaded category of \\"romantic comedy.\\" Just go see the maudlin, juvenile \\"Wedding Date\\" to see why. Admittedly, I am a bitter, misanthropic bookworm who spends more time alone than a mole in the ground. But that doesn't mean that I can't see where the good laughs are to be had, and \\"Hitch,\\" judging from the previews, was certainly one of those places. Thankfully, the promise of the previews was fulfilled. It is only February, but \\"Hitch\\" will probably go down as one of 2005's guilty pleasures.<br /><br />Like the recent summer flick \\"Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle,\\" this is one of those few gems capable of helping us take ourselves a little less seriously, laugh at how silly we are and lighten up about the big things: life, love, desire. As with most any comedy -- romantic or otherwise -- \\"Hitch\\" boats its share of condescendingly predictable twists and turns, and nearly derails toward the end in a desperate attempt at tying all loose knots with flowery ribbons. The final sequence in which Hitch (Will Smith) pulls out all the stops to land his heartthrob is just preposterous and almost as disastrous as the final, unendurably mawkish scenes of \\"The Terminal\\" last year.<br /><br />But I think that a romantic comedy is the kind of movie you can decide to like or dislike before you ever set foot inside the theater. You have to be reasonable -- a romantic comedy is the last sort of movie you want to burden with ambitious expectations. But, even for a cynic like me who has a lot of trouble following that advice, I have to say that \\"Hitch\\" works surprisingly well, despite its typical flaws. Will Smith's alluring confidence is on display here, trading in the malodramatic and brooding pomposity of \\"I, Robot\\" for a far friendlier and memorable role as a \\"love Doctor\\" capable of turning any man's wildest dreams into reality.<br /><br />When his services are demanded by Albert (Kevin James), a withdrawn, hopeless and overweight accountant, an unlikely magic ignites on screen between two phenomenally talented actors who both stumbled onto the right script. The scenes in which Hitch shows Albert the moves and the ropes are just hysterical, as when Albert shows off his geeky dance moves or fumbles through a phone call to Allegra Cole, his crush, eventually succumbing to his hilarious clumsiness with a crash. James is the big surprise of the film, but Smith carries himself just as well. His battle against a terrible food allergy is just hysterical, and his disastrous first date with Sara Melas (Eva Mendez) is very funny.<br /><br />I was surprised at just how consistently entertaining this film was without giving in to the temptations that most films like this can't resist. For the first 80% of the film, we are not always told how to think about what we're seeing or how to feel about the characters and their decisions. Not all the work is done for us. We are allowed to laugh without being told why we're laughing, and that's an achievement most romantic comedies just can't claim. \\"Hitch\\" makes for a fantastic date movie and might even give some cynics like myself a glimpse of the bright side. I recommend it.s services are demanded by Albert (Kevin James), a withdrawn, hopeless and overweight accountant, an unlikely magic ignites on screen between two phenomenally talented actors who both stumbled onto the right script.

0596000480|5.0|Great no-nonsense JavaScript Book which contains both theory, tutorial and a comprehensive JS reference. Covers JavaScript up until version 1.5. This is no disneyland stuff, this is hardcore JavaScript stuff that explains both the inner and outer workings of JavaScript and does so in more detail than any other book I've seen.     If (you want some disneyland typeof JavaScript){ you should check out the Visual Quickstart Guide's version, or something similar, and there you can learn JavaScript in a softer manner, and when you're ready for more, or are curious about the more fundamental aspects of the language, then this is the right book for that purpose. This book takes a very professional approach to JavaScript; treating it like a serious programming language, as opposed to silly toddler language, and it also deals with what JavaScript shares with other programming languages in terms of its syntax, impementation and  purposes. And so you will eventually get a much more concrete idea of what JavaScript really is, how it works, the potentials and limitations it has, and so on. Again, this is JavaScript a la serious business, so if you're new to JavaScript, warm up elsewhere before getting your hands dirty with this one.    }    else    {David is a good author. He seems really dedicated to teaching you the darned language for real. But also writes in a dry manner. You have to be hellbent on learning JavaScript with this book at your disposal, otherwise it'll freak you out.    }
B00007BKVC|5.0|Easy one of my top 10 favorites. This is an example of the great melding of writing/screenplay, directing, acting, cinematography and music. Every shot and piece of dialogue is choice. <br />Specifically to critique this DVD release: The alternate ending is way over the top and Ridley Scott was correct to use the current ending - but it is still a must see. As for the out-takes - the one I thought should've been left in is the extended dialogue between Jimmy & Louise in the hotel room - it gave depth to thier relationship and motivations. Biggest complaint is that this print is too dark compared to the VHS, LD, and DVD releases.
B00006LI4S|2.0|I was very excited when I first bought this DVD. That excitement lasted until I hit the \\"play\\" button. While I enjoyed \\"Smile,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" Dimming of the Day,\\" and Syd Barret's stuff, I was overall disappointed with this DVD. The reasons are as follows: <br /> <br />1) Gilmour has not aged well. In fact, he looks reminiscent of a bum with his unshaven, grizzly look. Also sporting a cheap t-shirt and an expansive gut, Gilmour looks terrible. Since looking at him while listening to the songs actually hurt my eyes, this detracts from the quality of the DVD, thus detracting from the overall score. <br /> <br />2) Gilmour's \\"guitar-god\\" image is ruined by this DVD. While I have always believed he was an excellent guitarist, I also had a few doubts. I have heard many things about Gilmour, including that a few of his solos are constructed from different takes. While that thought somewhat tarnished his image in my eyes, I always enjoyed his work anyway. On this DVD, however, Gilmour's playing seems to be lacking something. It feels like he is going through the motions, and not too well at that. After seeing Roger Waters' \\"In The Flesh\\" DVD, with Doyle Bramhall II on lead-guitar, watching Gilmour was almost painful. While part of this may be due to the acoustic environment, the lack of innovation and enthusiasm is disheartening. <br /> <br />3) \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" This is honestly the worst thing I have ever witnessed. Gilmour butchers this song by having Robert Wyatt sing Roger Waters' parts. I use the term sing loosely. Wyatt, while conveniently reading the lyrics from a piece of paper, sounds terrible. Off time, out of tune, and just downright ugly. This is a grave injustice to this great song, one of my favorites. Also, Gilmour's work on the guitar in this song pales in comparison to the original recording, or any other for that matter. The whole song just has a different feel, and not in a good way. <br /> <br />4) \\"Comfortably Numb\\"...Again. It is bad enoughthat Gilmour had to ruin this classic once on this DVD. But to do it twice is selfish and an insult to fans. Surprise guest Bob Geldof takes on Waters' parts this time around, and does an equally terrible job of it as Wyatt does. Geldof, a man who you might think would actually know the words to the song, baffles all by reading the lyrics from a piece of paper while butchering the timing and melody. While I can forgive Wyatt, he is old after all, there is no excuse for Geldof to mess this song up so badly. To go a step further, there is no excuse for Gilmour to ruin this song in the vain that he does, let alone twice. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a terrible DVD. The second star comes from the added bonus of \\"Don't\\" and the pieces of Barret's that Gilmour performs. Buyer beware.
B000174LVQ|5.0|Paco de Lucia is the best flamenco guitarist ever. This album is pure flamenco, del bueno, de corazn, flamenco de verdad!!! Great new compositiosn and amazing collaborations throughout the whole recording. If you are just atrting out get this, if you're a long time Paco fan, getthis too!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I swear to you, at first this CD will sound lame to non-Toolers. <br />After about a week you start to get into its very disturbed prog rhythem. After that instant comparisons come to the great prog gods Pink Floyd. Maynard is a vocal god. The drums make absolutly no sense musically at all, but yet they sound so amazing. The musicianship here is so deep it would take a musical genious to unravel. The same with the lyrics. Listening to some of these songs will take you in and out of conciousness. Litteraly. This really does from new types of music and breaks out of so many of the corporate genre sterotypes. This CD deserves to be number 1 on the kiddy TRL countdowns on MTV. It deserves to be number 1 on the highly overrated billboard charts. Everysong on this album is better than any of the songs by any pop artist EVER. The is a musician ship here unparrelled to any Hip/Hop, Punk and Pop. And this album is L-O-N-G. If you have the oppurtunity listen to this in one sitting. The song transitions are brilliant. <br />PICK UP THIS CD!
B000004756|5.0|When this three got together it was a night to remember.  Each guitarist has his own style; Paco is pure gypsy passion and speed, Di Meola is creative strnght and improvisation and Maclughlin has that impeccable playing.  The three put together is probably the best guitar live show ever, theres something here for everybody. It carries you effortlessly from flamenco to jazz to blues to the Pink Panther theme song without you even noticing it. I can listen to this album time and time again.

B000002GXS|5.0|This album captures, teh essence of Waits in the beggining, when he was a true baladeer. Piano plating and acoustic sounds all through the album.  Get this, the whole album has a vibe about it, its a time space in itself.
B000002LCX|2.0|It's not the best Smiths album. that's all there is to it. its alot more accesable than alot of their better stuff, so if you don't actually like the smiths, but you like songs like \\"How Soon is Now\\" and \\"Handsome Devil\\" then you may like it. But overall, its just a mess. it lacks the biting, satirical lyrics that are a trademark of morrisseys, and marr is just really below par. i mean, it's fine to listen to casually, but songs like \\"Death of a Disco Dancer\\" are so droning, i can barely get past them.
B000005JA8|1.0|Without a shred of a doubt, the WORST album EVER made in the ENTIRE history of Humankind.    I'm tempted to leave it at that but I can't.    This thing will give you nightmares for life!  It sounds like they put a bunch of electrified and acoustic instruments in an insane asylum and turned on a tape recorder!  And it's a DOUBLE ALBUM no less!  This piece of schit is not even good to play around people as a gag!  Don't even listen to the brief samples available here!  I suffered permanent brain damage!  Please, in God's name don't do it!  If you already have seek immediate medical care!  Hurry! Rush!  And be sure to close out the web site before you leave in case anybody else should come along and listen to it!  Dear God get going!  You need help man!      Any kook that thinks this monstrous turd should get 5 stars should be institutionalized immediately!     Still don't believe me.  Okay.  Check out \\"Pena\\".  I dare you.  Or \\"The Dust Blows Forward N The Dust Blows Back\\".  Or \\"Old Fart At Play\\".  Or \\"The Blimp\\".  Or \\"Orange Claw Hammer\\".  Or any of them for that matter.  You'll see.    By the way, anyone that does love this album should check out Brain Wilson's \\"Smile\\".  You're made for each other.      Over and out  (The Professor Recommends: \\"Voodoo Child(Slight Return)\\" by Jimi Hendrix)
0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaiman understands the iconography of our modern world more deeply than any modern writer.  He starts with a set of symbols we think we understand, then redefines them and presents them to us in such a stunning new light that the reader comes away wondering why they missed what should have been perfectly obvious.  In this book he takes that same magic touch and applies it to the London Underground.  Subway trains, we learn, hold the high court of an aging, eccentric baron.  Empty rooms are bound together by magic doors and lived in by people of such high noble standing that even the angels envy them.  That drunken beggar sleeping on the platform turns out to be the loyal retainer of a high prince.<br /><br />After you read this book you will never again look at a subway train the same way.  Neil Gaiman has mastered something few writers ever learn: fiction changes the way we see our world.
B00000JLWW|1.0|This movie should have been R rated! Read this before you let your kid watch this: <br />Rated PG-13 for (although it should have been rated R): <br />sensuality, nudity (you see a girls butt and boobs and its not breif either) a sex scene, peril, violence, and upsetting scenes.  <br />          Now, if you have been recently wondering if this movie would be sutible for your child I hope you have now gotten your answer.
0684803356|5.0|Hemmingway transcribes his expat experiences in the Spanish American war into a gripping story of the futility of combat.  The main characters hide in the hills struggling between loyalty to their anti-fascist cause, and the scars caused by the attrocities they've experienced.   <br /> <br />For whom the bell tolls, as we all know, \\"It tolls for thee!\\" This summarizes the story.  To Hemmingway, war is futile.  We all lose.  Agree or disagree with the morality, the story captures Hemmingway's ability to lay emotions bare with strong minimalist prose and dialogure.
B00018D44U|2.0|Norah apparently likes country/bluegrass music, all fine and good. The problem is that she hasn't learned how to or simply can't let her voice shine in that genre of music. Her voice has this rare intimate quality that works best in jazz or blues, or music with those types of hooks like \\"Those sweet words\\" and \\"What am I to You\\". But listen to \\"Creepin In\\", she gets blown out of the water by Dolly Parton (who I don't even like) so much so you don't even want to hear Norah sing again. So it goes with most of the CD until the last \\"I Don't Miss You At All\\" a jazz standard that although she heatbreakingly missinterprets, comes out fine. Norah is a young singer who I'm sure is completely unaware of what it is about her voice that is so special, therefore she doesn't nurture it and it hurt her on this CD.
0345410025|5.0|I have had this book for only three weeks. I read it the day I obtained it (it's an easy read!). I have been slowly implementing the basics of what the book teaches you with AMAZING results! I am now able to remember things that I would have a very difficult time doing so in my usual \\"rote\\" method. With the rote method of memory, I found myself constantly frustrated that I would lose some of the items I spent time learning when trying to recall them later. My only recourse would be to go back and start over with that lost item using the rote method.  <br /> <br />With the techniques learned in this book, not only did I look at the material only once, I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN IT! I know the techniques in the book sound silly, but that's the point! It's the silly things that capture our minds and keeps us interested. In a \\"silly\\" way, you learn the material in a manner you never thought of before. Harry mentions in the book that you are learning things in a different mode of thinking. <br /> <br />As others have stated, a good memory can be \\"trained\\". This means you have to have some faith when initially trying the techniques. You will stumble, but only for a moment. You have to learn how to sharpen the techniques. Another point is that initially, the techniques will take some time to administer and will, for a short time, take more time to implement than the rote method. For instance, the one activity that took a while for me was forming pictures and associations for substitute words. I had to take the \\"intangible\\" word and make it into one or more \\"tangible\\" words. Then, I had to associate those items carefully. This took a while, but what kept me motivated was the fact that I could recall everything I had learned thus far. So, while the process took some time, I never LOST ANYTHING! Since the example stated above, my speed at the process has been steadily improving. Again, your newly acquired skills, like ANY skills, have to be practiced and sharpened. <br /> <br />Ihave been learning the phonetic number system and I have a functional knowledge of it currently. I plan on sharpening that skill more before I attempt the \\"peg\\" technique. My goal is to learn all 100 pegs Harry has listed in the chapter, 10 at a time. <br /> <br />This book is a classic and you WILL be changed as a result of implementing what it teaches. But, you have to be ready to work for a while before seeing automatic application of the techniques. The bottom line is that the more you use it, the better you will get and you WON'T forget!
B0001CNRS4|1.0|First off the movie-predictable, shallow with horrible acting. I knew that going in but figured Jessica alba would be worth it and my girlfriend liked it so I got the DVD... If you watch all the way through the outtakes the director sneaks in some footage of Jessica being really snotty to Lil' Bow Wow. \\"Could you please stop touching me!\\" she says to the playful boy on the set. That right there blows it for me.
B00004XQP4|5.0|2000's Warning was Green Day's least selling album since their best selling album Dookie. However, that doesn't mean that Warning is a bad album. It features some very catchy songs with infectious music. Minority, Waiting, and the title track, Warning, are the three tracks that were released as singles. The album's remaining tracks are a combination of signature Green Day: Fashion Victim, Deadbeat Holiday; with some promising new-ground venturing tunes: Blood Sex And Booze, the Beatles-esque Misery, Church On Sunday, the Dylan-esque Hold On, and the beautiful Macy's Day Parade, that all sum up the highlights on Warning. <br /> <br />This album sounded cool when it was first released, and now with the release of Green Day's masterpiece American Idiot, it sounds even better. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A-
B000003TAB|5.0|This isn't Nirvana's best album, but it's my favorite Nirvana album.  It just really grows on you.  The first thing that got me hooked was the infectious chorus in \\"sliver\\".  The Vaseline covers are great, too.  Buy it Buy it Buy it!
B000001DZM|5.0|I've had this soundtrack for over 5 years, and I love it to death.  It's one of my favorites, with a great variety of music.  It always puts me in a good mood, and is overall just a great compilation.  You'll love it!
B00000IL26|5.0|The late fifties and early sixties finds jazz forging beautiful new ground with the likes of Miles, Coltrane, Cannonball Adderly, Clifford Brown, Joe Henderson, Wes Montgomery, and, of course, Lee Morgan, the creator of all six pieces on this satisfying collection of straight-up bebop. I think about that time and realize how unique it was, and what precise and deeply moving art was pumping through the blood of these guys. It is so great that we can hear it now via these re-releases of Blue Note catalog pieces recorded at the legendary Van Gelder Studio in NJ.<br /><br />Too bad that America wasn't as sophisticated as the music blossoming in its midsts and never really embraced the wonder of this joyful sound.
B0000024K1|5.0|This is the best album of the 80s. it's one of the best political statements made in music history. Bring the noise, Dont beleive the Hype, She watch channel Zero, Night of the living Baseheads, Rebel without a pause are all timeles hip-hop classics. Buy this album, read the lyrics and get educated. This is what good hip-hop music sounds like.
B0002858YS|5.0|A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. That is the word to describe Hot Fuss. Out of all the 2004 releases by U2 and Green Day, their albums don't compare one bit to Hot Fuss. Every song has it's own great qualites and it's been three months and I still have not taken it out of my CD player. They will definiatly be winning a Grammy in 2005. All the best to them.
B000003TA4|5.0|It's funny how people discrespect one of the best and most influential Rock albums of the 20th century. This album was truly unique upen its release and you can hear how many bands tried to copy its style and sound. <br /> <br />The album kicks of with the classic \\"Smells like a teen Spirit\\" every rock fan in the world knows this song, it doesn't matter how old you are, you've heard this song before. \\"In bloom\\" \\"Come as you are\\" \\"Lithuim\\" \\"Drain you\\" are all timeless rock classics. But all the songs are great, if you're a rock fan this album is a necessity.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|After Bruce Dickinson's departure from Maiden in 1994, the much controversial Blaze-era of the band, despite various attempts on Harris' side, failed to appease the larger Maiden fanbase. On the other hand, Bruce was releasing excellent albums, such as Accident of Birth and The Chemical Wedding, but his sales numbers were no where near as good as classic Maiden's. A reunion was more than necessary for both sides and everyone knew they had to do their best to get Maiden back up on its feet as strong as ever.<br /><br />And the new album delivered successfully! Brave New World is as good as any 80's Maiden classic; it is also one of the most amazing, satifying come-back albums ever. Some people had their concerns about Bruce and Adrian's return, they thought Maiden had lost it already, be it with or without Bruce at the helm. Well, they were all proven wrong, thankfully. Both Bruce and Adrian bring the glorious 80's days of Maiden back; and while Adrian Smith doesn't do much songwriting on this record, he's definitely there 100% -- his presence in the compositions is easily noticed as Steve Harris certainly did not interfere in choosing the colour of Adrian's sound. Adrian is there to reach certain atmospheres, give Maiden its much-missed unique blessing. That said, he did co-write two tracks, the magnificent opening tune \\"The Wicker Man\\" and \\"Fallen Angel\\". \\"The Wicker Man\\" is not only the ultra-perfect choice to start the album, but it is also one of the greatest album-openers in the entire Iron Maiden back catalog. It's compact (not overly drawn-out like the opener of The X Factor!), melodically enhanced, and carefully composed to have gripping sing-along choruses on tour, which proved perfect on the band's following live album, Rock in Rio.<br /><br />The two 'immediate epic' tunes on the record are the title track, also co-written by Bruce, and the 100% Harris penned, \\"Blood Brothers\\". These two songs will immediately stick out upon initial listens, showcasing every aspect of Iron Maiden's brilliance as an ensemble. The title track starts with a nice keyboard melody, as its sparse notes transform into a crashing Heavy Metal anthem. The song features all three guitarists playing magnificent solos that are, thanks to Kevin Shirley's magical mix, distinctive in style, tone, and phrasing. \\"Blood Brothers\\" has fluid guitar lines in its intro decorated with Nicko's cymbals ringing in the background secretly. As the song develops, a powerfully intense guitar theme sharply soars above the almost symphonic-like arrangement. It's really amazing.<br /><br />\\"The Mercenary\\" is by some considered a filler, but I've always loved it mainly because of Bruce's vocals in the chorus, especially how he goes, \\"Show them no fear, show them no PAIN!\\". Brave New World needed this type of songs (\\"Ghost of the Navigator\\", \\"The Mercenary, \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", etc.) to keep things in balance, with all the other lengthy pieces. Take \\"Dream of Mirrors\\", it is the longest song on this disc, not only that, but also one of my favourite Iron Maiden songs, ever. Give a listen to Harris' bass line and Bruce's extremely British English-accented delivery in the beginning. This track may seem a little overshadowed by the more epic-structured numbers here, but repeated listenings will reveal this song's ultimate brilliance for sure. \\"The Nomad\\" is another 9-minute metal anthem with quite unconventional melodies employed, or check out the brief staccato riffing right in the first ten seconds of \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". These are all great factors that play a role in diversifying this almost 70-minute long record.<br /><br />And finally a few words about (third) guitarist Janick Gers. Despite those who want him out of the band as Adrian Smith is now back in action, Gers never fails to add invaluable elements to the richness of Maiden's sound. Also, he is credited as a main songwriter on BNW on nearly half of the songs, which is more than both Murray and Smith's contribution. People just have to acknowledge Janick's undeniable contribution to the band, not just as a stageman, but an honest, powerful songwriter. I have to admit that I have listened to Brave New Worlds more than any other Maiden release in the last five years, i.e. since this disc came out. That includes their last one Dance of Death. I love pretty much every Maiden disc (save for the Blaze era) and could never rank them, but I must say Brave New World always comes to my mind first because of its intensity and cohesive compositions.ray and Smith's contribution.

B00006JJ51|5.0|This is west cost hip-hop music at its absoulte best. This album is also the blueprint for gangsta rap. N.W.A created a style of rap that's been bitten by so many MCs that it's hard to tell who created it first, they were the first to make a song like F*** Da police. <br /> <br />EXPRESS YOURSELF is my personal Favorite song on the whole album but mostly all the songs are great with the exception of 2 (SOMETHING TO DANCE TO, COMPTON'S IN THE HOUSE). Buy this album and see how Gangsta rap started.
B000001A3H|5.0|Kyuss is a band that I have been aware of for quite some time, but never even gave them a chance until I bought this.  I would always read about them when reading about similar artists to my favorite bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and other early alternative bands.  And of course like almost everyone else, I also heard about them through the truly genious band that is Queens of the Stone Age.  I thought that QOTSA had a great sound unlike anyone else, until I learned that Kyuss was basically QOTSA before there was such thing as QOTSA.  With my new knowledge I researched them and found out that this was their best album and bought it as soon as I could find it.  I didnt really know what to expect, but it certainly beat out my biggest expectations.  The thing that hit me the hardest was the originality of it.  Nowadays its so difficult to be original because almost everything has been done, but this is an exceptionally awsome and original sound.  Josh Homme's guitar can best be described as thunderous.  That would be the best adjective to describe what you get with an ultra deep tuned guitar played through a bass amp.  And as a testiment to both Kyuss's and Queens of the Stone Age's greatness, Nick Oliveri is the perfect rythmic sidekick for Josh.  His playing is great and powerful.  Put aside the musicianship and the songwriting alone is worth anyone owning this album. I'm not too sure where this review is going, there is too much to praise for this album, I could keep going for days.  I guess my best advice for anyone who has actually taken the time to read this far is to buy this album as soon as you can find it (its not exactly in high demand, so not every store has it) or just use the wonderful services of amazon.  One more thing: they call it stoner rock for a reason... Listen to it stoned!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|If you know the Metallica story this will take you deep into it more than you have EVER imagined! At well over two hours long this film is well worth the money!! Plus another disc of bonus footage. You will get into it even if you are not a fan. But if you are a Metallica fan you have to see this. It is that good and really interesting to view. This film is NOT just about them making a new record. It tackles the issues from the past that we never heard all sides of. The stand out scene for me is Lars Ulrich and Dave Mustaine from Megadeath sit in a room for the first time in 20 years. Dave talks about his sadness over being kicked out of the band in 1983. Even with his great career with Megadeath he still feels like he is in 2nd place to Metallica. Lars has to listen to this and deal with it on camera and answer his questions. I just wish this clip went on longer! This film also has new interviews with Jason Newsted the Metallica bass player that left them a few years ago. His leaving was a big surprise to the fans. The fans never really got the whole story of why he left at the time. In this, You get his side of the story and also the bands side. James now feels he could have treated him better looking back. I have always loved good music documentaries like JIMI HENDRIX(1973) THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT(The Who)1979. Or even The Beatles LET IT BE. This one is much more real and in your face than any other. This is a band showing us everything!

The only thing more enjoyable than that is listening to the entire album... stoned, very stoned.  Everybody knows how great it is to listen to music high, but you cant begin to understand the true magic of it until you listen to this album.  As for the greatness of the actual music, I'm at a loss for words, there is no way to properly describe its greatness.  The English language can not supply a strong enough adjective to describe the ... I dont even know what I'm trying to say, like I said it cant be descibed.  That and I'm too stoned to think.  I think I'm gunna leave now and listen to Badmotorfinger.  Listen to Kyuss - Blues for the Red Sun for another enlightening stoned musical experience.  And of course, the great Pink Floyd.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Roger Ebert must have been having a bad day when he reviewed this film because he completely whiffed this one. There is a great deal more to Napoleon Dynamite than may appear with one viewing.<br /><br />Every once in awhile, a movie comes along that demonstrates an understanding of humanity that is profound.  I believe this is one of those movies.<br /><br />On the surface, it is a humorous movie about nerdy kids and their daily lives.  The movie is not laughing out loud funny, nor is it a &#34;nerd kids strike back at the system&#34; formula movie. Beneath that surface, there is an important message about the inherent nobility and value possible in every human being, no matter what their surface appearance. There are no Hollywood stars or Hollywood pretentiousness. The story is small, local, evenly paced and engaging.<br /><br />Napolean is pushed around and mocked by classmates, but he seems to accept it as part of his existence. He is perfectly content with who he is and knows, accurately, the problems are with whom everyone else thinks he is.  When he has the opportunity to &#34;pay back&#34; those humiliating him, he does it in an entirely creative and satisfying way.<br /><br />There is no violence and no humiliation in his response to his peers.  He wins because he demonstrates nobility, talent, and loyalty to his friends that raises him above those who demean him.  He uses his innate humanity to shine a bright light on the shallowness of those that would place themselves above him.<br /><br />His friends and relatives, each on the surface a &#34;loser,&#34; get the opportunity to individually rise above the audiences automatic expectations of their &#34;loser-ness&#34; and become fully important and credible people.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film as an excellent family film, especially for families with kids in middle school and high school. The film asks you to examine your perceptions of others around you.  Are you one of the people who mock those whom you perceive as nerds, or are you more like Napolean?  Perhaps a little of each?<br /><br />Either way, the movie is a refreshing affirmation of the best aspects of humanity and hopefully, you can watch it and apply its lessons to your own life.k those whom you perceive as nerds, or are you more like Napolean?

B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top became one of the most recognizable and popular rock bands in the 80's. They became one of the first bands to use the power of MTV to their advantage. By using the new (at that time) music channel, they created an image of \\"cool\\". With their long beards, dark shades, and hats, the boys from Texas were cool as cucumbers. They also created some really good songs, which \\"Greatest Hits\\" is packed with. <br /> <br />ZZ Top evolved from a blues-based boogie rock band to a commercial band that could sell albums and place many singles in the top 20, along with creative and unique music videos. \\"Greatest Hits\\" hand picks the most successful songs from this trio and places them on one disc. From their early days there is \\"La Grange\\", the popular boogie blues rock song that still is in many action movies to this day. Another song from their early days, \\"Tush\\", is also included. Also included are the hits: the popular \\"Gimmie All Your Lovin'\\", the ode to beautiful women \\"Legs\\", the 80's anthem to yuppies \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", the double meaning sexual song \\"pearl necklace\\", \\"Sleeping Bag\\", \\"Planet of Women\\" and many others. Also included are some new songs, including a cover of Elvis Presleys \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" and \\"Gun Love\\", a brand new song by the trio. <br /> <br />If you are a casual fan, \\"Greatest Hits\\" will give you the dose of ZZ Top that you need. If you are a more serious fan, you might be more interested in the albums to check out some of their popular album tracks as well as singles.
B00005JN0T|3.0|To me, this movie was just ok. I actually fell in love with the robot, Sonny, and thought he played a better role in the movie than Will Smith did.  I spoke to other people and they all agreed that when this movie was being released, a pretty big deal was made out of it, because the budget to make it was pretty large.  It was rather disappointing on that scale.  The plot was mediocre, and I had my opinions on other ways that it actually should have taken.  It is pretty suspenseful throughout in a whodunnit kinda way, but I didn't enjoy the way it ended at all.  The visuals ARE amazing, and I was awed at the massive amounts of robots and computer effects.  All in all, the visuals and robots make this a great movie to look at, but the plot leaves something to be desired.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Picture this: 1978. Disco is very popular, with radio stations and clubs playing nothing but the Bee Gees and K.C. and the Sunshine Band. Every now and then, you hear a cut from ELO or Pink Floyd, but rock was in a depression. The Beatles were long gone, and many of the big name bands of the 70's/80's weren't popular yet. For music fans, you had to deal with disco and folk singers like James Taylor. Yeah, for rock fans, it was a music hell. <br /> <br />So one night you turn on your radio to the night time show where the DJ will play new cuts of never before heard of artists or bands (this was when listening to the radio was still cool and a great place to discover a lot of new music). Sometimes you found cool artists or bands from this show, like Steve Miller Band or Billy Joel. Other times, you heard another disco knock off or another artist trying to immitate Carly Simon. However, sometimes you got really lucky and heard something so new and different that it made you salivate.  <br /> <br />So in 1978 you are listening to the show, wishing, hoping, and praying that it's not just another disco band or folk singer. The DJ announces that the new artist is Van Halen and the song is \\"Eruption\\". \\"Hmmmm\\" you say to yourself. It could be another dance disco song or a folk singer singing about bombs. But, it's your lucky day. BAM! A drum introduction like a semi, and then you hear the sickest guitar lick that your virgin ears have ever encountered. How in the WORLD is this artist doing this? Who are these guys? What planet are they from? So you call up all your buddies, ask them if they heard what you heard, and you thank your lucky stars, because there is hope for rock music after all. <br /> <br />The next day at school, the talk of the kids is of this new band. \\"Did you hear that new cut from Van Halen?\\" \\"Can You Do the Eddie Van Halen on your guitar?\\" \\"Do you know what record store is selling the album, or when it arrives?\\" While bored in school, you start air guitaring to that song you heard on the radio the night before. When the bus drops you off at home, you grab a few dollars from your piggy bank, and head to the record store. On the cover, you see the four guys who make this band called \\"Van Halen\\". You bring it home, throw the needle on the record, and crank up the volume. You begin rocking out to songs like \\"You Really Got Me Now\\", \\"Jamies Cryin'\\", \\"Running With the Devil\\", and of course \\"Eruption\\". You have found your new love in music, and your parents have found their worst nightmare. <br /> <br />\\"Van Halen\\", the debut album from the band with the same name, is a masterpiece, and at the time it was a revolution to hundreds and thousands of rock and music fans.
B000002NIW|5.0|When I first heard of the Deftones, it was when Change (in the house of flies) was a single on the radio, and I bought White Pony. I was impressed, so I decided to expand my library and I was never disappointed. Around the Fur was the second and best Deftones CD I bought. I won't go through and rate every song, but just know that they are all extremely good. The best song on the CD is Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away). It is as close to a masterpiece that the Deftones could've hoped to have made. The other strong tracks are My Own Summer, Around the Fur and Dai the Flu. If you like metal, or just modern rock in general, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not buying this album.
B000089RVX|3.0|I got to experience a little bit of Evanescence and Amy Lee's awesome voice in the Daredevil soundtrack with the songs &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot;. Both are incredible songs, but the rest of Fallen is deeper, more interesting music. The most important thing to me when listening to music is the lyrics. Anyone can slap down something that rhymes, add a few measures of guitar, and repeat it over and over. If the lyrics are complicated and thought-provoking then you know someone thought about it before they put it out on the market for everyone to hear. Although the music is suspiciously similar between tracks, the lyrics were definitely thought through. It's nice to know that someone in the music biz still cares about what they're broadcasting to the world. &#60;br /&#62;      The worst song on Fallen is Everybody's Fool. Its topic reflects mainstream pop envy and the song structure is pretty boring. The best songs are My Last Breath, Taking Over Me, and Tourniquet. Tourniquet is a song about suicide put together in a very unique and different way. Instead of self-pitying people screaming &quot;Everything's terrible! Oh look, a knife!&quot; Amy Lee gives a different view-the realization that suicide was a mistake. In this song she is praying for forgiveness for the mistake she has just made. &quot;I lay dying/And I'm pouring/Crimson regret and betrayal...My god/My tourniquet/Return to me salvation&quot;. If the topic of suicide is taboo to you then this song is not for you. &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; is a good love song that sets itself apart from other carbon-copy songs repeating &quot;I love you, I want you, I miss you&quot;, etc. &quot;My Last Breath&quot;...I'm still unsure of exactly what Amy is trying to say here, but a good song nonetheless. &#60;br /&#62;      &quot;Fallen&quot; was a good starter album for Evanescence.    I think this band needs more attention than it is getting; they have a lot of potential. I think there is a lotof talent that is not being put to full use for fear of becoming too different from usual interest. But as most music enthusiasts will agree, different is better.
B00068IOWC|1.0|By Greg Kot <br />Tribune music critic <br /> <br /> <br />It will be difficult to miss the presence of U2 Sunday night at the Grammy Awards.

0316172324|4.0|i would definately reccommend this book.  it is an interesting subject, it is well written, and it makes you step back and realize how we take a large portion of our thinking for granted.  when he talked about how words that we barely acknowledge can make subtle changes in our behavior and actions, it made me more aware of the potential of our brains, as well as more aware of what i am reading or seeing.  this is not a self help book that tells you how to increase your thinking power.  this book tells you that you already have the ability to make sound snap decisions and you should realize that.

Yet the majority of the record-buying public is under age 25, most too young to remember U2 classics such as \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby.\\" Like any band that hits rock 'n' roll middle age, U2 is grappling with the question of how to stay relevant in an industry that caters to youth. <br /> <br />\\"When we were kids, doing a TV ad, appearing on the Super Bowl halftime or singing at the Grammys would be a bad move for credibility, but not anymore,\\" says Iovine, who adds that the band turned down three $20 million TV ad offers from other corporations before agreeing to the Apple deal because it \\"fit what they wanted to do aesthetically.\\" He insists that the band received no money for the ad, which essentially served as a commercial for the new album while associating it with a \\"cool product that's a mainline right to a younger audience.\\" <br />
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|First of all, shoot the writer.  When you are working with Homer as a source--show some respect!  Then shoot the producers.  The Iliad is not a romance. Killing off Menalaus half way through the movie--just stupid! Briseis kills Agamemnon after the fall of Troy?  Huh? What are these people thinking?  The list of really unnecessary plot adulterations goes on.  Oh, I know Hollywood producers probably thought they needed a love interest for box office reasons, but even that could have been handled with a little more subtlty and without looking truly ridiculous, which is really all I can say about the ending.  They could have pulled off a really great movie.<BR>    All that said, I'm still giving this 4 stars.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for this stuff because the TV Helen of Troy, though more true to the story, was a little disappointing.  The Iliad really does need the kind of epic treatment Hollywood can give it, if only Hollywood had the brains and sensitivity to the material they are working with to do it justice.  And there are some pluses in the movie besides just the lavish spectacle. I've heard many people mock the choice of Brad Pitt as Achilles, but I really thought he did the role justice.  His Achilles really has a chip on his shoulder and he sulks through the part in real heroic style.  Whatever else I didn't like about the script I did think it captured what motivated Achilles pretty well, and even the rather modern anti-war touch that came out at times was not overdone.  The fight scenes, particularly the climactic encounter with Hector, were brilliantly choreographed.  And Peter O'Toole was, as always, fabulous.
B000063DIH|3.0|By the time Iron Maiden released their 9th studio album in 1992, entitled Fear Of The Dark, they were a household name in the heavy metal world. Kings of their game and ontop of the hill. They held the yard stick. <br />But in my opinion, what you hear on Fear Of The Dark is the product of a tired and worn out band, which set the scene of what was to happen next.  <br />I noticed a glimpse of Maiden's tiredness from their previous album, No Prayer For the Dying, and with this album, it grew even further. Whether Iron Maiden were changing with the times, as the 80's were long gone, there was something different with Fear Of The Dark...and it was disappointing. <br />Since guitarist Adrian Smith left the band in 1990 (before No Prayer For The Dying), there has been a noticable drop in the quality of the lyrics and song structure. New guitarist, Jannick Gers, did not contribute to the song-writing on \\"Prayer\\", but did co-write 5 songs on Fear Of The Dark, and to their latest album, still does help write a good portion of the band's songs. <br />Onto the album in question. It begins quickly with the thundering drums of Nicko McBrain to start Be Quick Or Be Dead, an awesome opener, perfect for Bruce Dickinson's vocal style. From Here To Eternity is next, a different type of Maiden song, lyrics wise, and it is saved by a very good chorus and solo. Overall, the song has a \\"fun\\" feel to it.  <br />Afraid To Shoot Strangers is next, the song is based on the 1st Gulf War, about normal everyday people forced into battle by governments to kill people they dont know, nor even want to kill. It's one of the best songs on the album. Fear Is The Key follows and again the level drops a little. Despite the nice \\"galloping\\" guitar riffs, the song lacks depth and soon becomes boring. <br />Childhood's End is next, and again is an average track. By this far into the album, the style of the band's music is very different comparred to previous albums. The bands seems angry and their lyricstend to speak about the struggles of the little people and how they are manipulated by politicians/government, and the after-effects of war. <br />Wasting Love follows, where it does pick up slightly. A semi-ballad, with nice riffs, but still not a standout track. The Fugitive is next, which is one of the better songs on the album, with a ripping chorus and a fitting solo. <br />The next two songs are arguably the poorest on the whole album (Chains Of Misery & The Appariton). Things get back on track with the next song- Judas Be My Guide, a great song from start to finish. Unfortunately it is also very short, clocking in at just 3:08. Weekend Warrior is next, and it continues the trend of average songs on the album. The title track ends the album, and although it is a very good song, I tend to prefer the live version of this song, as the studio version lacks a little something. <br />At the end of listening to this album, you are left disappointed and thinking that you havent gotten enough from it, that something was missing.  <br />To me, Fear Of The Dark felt rushed, constructed quickly and recorded that way. Despite 5 great tracks, there seemed a lot of \\"fillers\\". <br />Bruce Dickinson's song-writing had weakened, while Steve Harris' contributions were still strong and saved this album from being a disaster. The addition of Jannick Gers into the song-writing also helped. <br />As if you could tell something was wrong with the band, in 1993 Bruce Dickinson left Iron Maiden to pursue a solo career... <br />(rating each song is as follows: 0.98-1= killer track, 0.95-0.97= awesome track, 0.90-0.93= very good track, 0.85-0.88= OK/good track, 0.80-0.83= poor/average track. Once you add up the score, divide it by the number of tracks to get the %) <br /> <br />Be Quick Or Be Dead: 1 <br />From Here To Eternity: 0.93 <br />Afraid To Shoot Strangers: 1 <br />Fear Is The Key: 0.90 <br />Childhood's End: 0.90 <br />Wasting Love: 0.92 <br />The Fugitive: 0.93 <br />Chains Of Misery: 0.88 <br />The Apparition: 0.85 <br />Judas Be My Guide: 1 <br />Weekend Warrior: 0.90 <br />Fear Of The Dark: 0.95  = 11.16, divided by 12 (tracks)= 93% <br /> <br />In my opinion, Fear Of The Dark is ranked 10th out of 13 in the best to least best Iron Maiden albums. Like I wrote at the start of this review, this is a tired effort by Iron Maiden. <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I am greatly impressed when the industry exposes such talent of true artistry.  2004 was a great year for talent; Jamie Cullum, John Legend, Prince, Jill Scott, Mia Miata, and many more...      I must say \\"Get Lifted\\" is one of my favorite CDs for 2004.
B000063DFN|4.0|Powerslave, Iron Maiden's 5th studio album, released in 1984. And it ranks with one of their best. Most Maiden fans consider Powerslave to be Iron Maiden's best album, and I somewhat agree...somewhat. <br />Powerslave was the album to shoot Maiden far into heavy metal stardom and contains 4 tracks which arguably could be their best songs ever (Aces High, 2 Minutes To Midnight, Powerslave & Rime Of The Ancient Mariner). But those songs are only half of the album. The other 4 tracks would be summed up as average at best, whether it would be from poor lyrics or it just isnt very good. So ,as a whole album, those average tracks bring down this album...but not too far.   <br />The album kicks off with a bang with Aces High. Dickinson's vocals in full swing, especially in the chorus. 2 Minutes To Midnight is the next track, and another fantastic song that ranks up there with Maiden's best ever. Track 3 is an instrumental called Losefer Words. As far as instrumentals go, it is very good, but a track you would normally skip.  <br />Flash Of The Blade comes next, and in my opinion it's an average to OK track, but nowhere near as good as the first two (or last two). The Duallists is next, the track which is consider to be the poorest on the album. The album picks up a little with the next track, Back In The Village, but again only warrants an average to OK rating.  <br />The albums picks up from where it started, with the fantastic title track, Powerslave, which is followed by the awesome 13+ minute epic, Rime Of The Ancient Mariner to close out the album.  <br />Song-writing is very good on this album (as it is on all of Maiden's albums). Steve Harris continues to bring out wonderful lyrics and music, and is the heart and soul of Iron Maiden, though he tends to stay in the shadows and let Bruce Dickinson be the face of Maiden.  <br />Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith also contributes to the song-writing on this album, Dickinson has two songs to his name, Powerslave and FlashOf The Blade, while Smith and Dickinson co-wrote 2 Minutes To Midnight and Back In The Village. <br />Musically, you know how Maiden plays. Air raid siren vocals with soaring guitars and heavy bass with pounding drums. Powerslave is all that and more. <br />(rating each song is as follows: 0.98-1= killer track, 0.95-0.97= awesome track, 0.90-0.93= very good track, 0.85-0.88= OK/good track, 0.80-0.83= poor/average track. Note, instrumentals are not included) <br /> <br />Aces High: 1 <br />2 Minutes To Midnight: 1 <br />Flash Of The Blade: 0.88 <br />The Duallists: 0.85  <br />Back In The Village: 0.85 <br />Powerslave: 1 <br />Rime Of The Ancient Mariner: 1   = 0.94, or 94% <br /> <br />This album is worth purchasing for those 4 awesome tracks alone and it also has the best album cover of all Maiden albums. This is classic 80's Iron Maiden at their best.  <br />In my opinion, Powerslave is Iron Maiden's 4th best studio album.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Wow, Michael Buble music just blow's me away! I heard the hit title \\"Home\\" for the first time at a Love Jam Concert in February 4th, 2005 in the bay area, CA at an intermission and I was swept away from my feet.  From that moment I knew Michael Buble voice was a classic, I went and bought all of his music CD's collection.  Now, I am hooked on Michael Buble! <br /> <br />Enjoy and Cheers, <br /> <br />Jerry Lin <br />SF, Bay Area, CA
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First, I have extreme hatred for a certain network for dooming this series from its outset. Never given a chance, Firefly is THE BEST SF series I've ever watched. Its original network aired episodes out of order, put it on during Friday at 8pm (which kills EVERY show), and killed it with 2 episodes in the can to great criticism by the viewing public. Despite a vast grassroots movement, it was never rebroadcasted and when I saw this season of it packaged with 2 unaired episodes... there was no way I couldn't buy it. <br /> <br />Basically, the show is a cross between Star Wars and Maverick. A space captain and his... diverse crew fly the not-so-friendly skies in dusters sporting pistols and rifles move stolen cargo under the nose of what basically amounts to an evil galactic empire. Nine characters round out a diverse crew, each of which is a puzzle. It's just a shame that... a certain network stole some of the pieces and put on some reality TV garbage in its place. <br /> <br />Firefly is visually beautiful in a gritty Neal Stephenson way and boasts a well-balanced sense of drama with a wonderful sense of humor. Just remember that by the time you finish your fifth episode (less than half-way through the season), you'll be beside yourself with disgust at a reality-TV heavy entertainment industry.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Pennywise the clown succeeded in making a clown scary.  I never will look at a clown the same way.  Where I had some difficulty was linking the clown to the creature that consumes the bodies of those who have been \\"blinded by his dead lights.\\"<br /><br />The best part of the movie for me was the early part with the children coming together to overcome the evil of this creature as well as the evil influence that it seemed to convey to the rest of the community.  I could relate to these children and appreciated each of them as they showed their unique personalities.<br /><br />The second part of the movie, dominated by the adults, I didn't find as compelling, though the clown continued to be a scary and devious menace.  But the protagonists just didn't jive with the children I thought I knew in the first half of the movie.<br /><br />Even so, this movie had many scary moments for me.  Though not a great film, this was a good and memorable one.  The human element of the childhood comaraderie made this film more than just a film about a spooky, evil, clown.
B000002UDD|4.0|After the awesome \\"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\\", Megadeth had a lot of hype to live up to. While I don't believe this album is a worthy successor, I certainly can't see why it gets some bad reviews. Come on... you can't tell me that this album is worse than the horrid, unlistenable \\"Cryptic Writings\\" or the average \\"Risk\\". <br /> <br />Anyway... here are my views on the album. Dave Mustaine and the rest of the band were flat drunk while making this album, and it shows: This is Megadeth at their most brutal, drunk, emotional, and violent. So, here's a track-by-track review: <br /> <br />Into The Lungs Of Hell: A somewhat short, yet fast-paced instrumental. It's pretty cool. (4/5) <br /> <br />Set The World Afire: \\"NO SURVIVORS... SET THE WORLD AFIRE!!!\\" I love this song, and you should too. (5/5) <br /> <br />Anarchy In The U.K.: You either love or hate Dave's cover of this Sex Pistols song. Personally, I kind of like it. (4/5) <br /> <br />Mary Jane: This is where the album begins to sag. Not that great of a song. (3/5) <br /> <br />502: A song about Dave getting pulled over. Pass this one up. (2/5) <br /> <br />In My Darkest Hour: Here, the album picks up again. A great song about someone who wants to kill himself, then decides not to do it. (5/5) <br /> <br />Liar: Dave vents at Megadeth's former lead guitarist, Chris Poland, who sold all of the band's equipment for drug money. It's freakin' hilarious. \\"YOU... YOU... YOU F***ING LIAR!!!\\" (5/5) <br /> <br />Hook In Mouth: My favorite song, this one's about the stupidity of the PRMC and censorship in general. You can listen to this one over and over again... (5/5) <br /> <br />That's \\"So Far So Good... So What!\\" If you're new to Megadeth, pick up \\"Peace Sells...\\" or \\"Rust In Peace\\" instead, but if you already know what Megadeth's about, i'd definitely recommend buying this one before any of their 90's albums. It's well worth the money.
B000002LFZ|4.0|One of the enjoyable things about Fleetwood Mac is the use of different voice combinations.  Christine McVie and Stevie Nix have unique vocal sounds and Lyndsey Buckingham makes his own unique contribution.  This album truly has most of the best of Fleetwood Mac, though one song I would have like to see was \\"The Chain\\" from the \\"Rumours\\" album which I believe was one of their better songs.<br /><br />Even so, every rock-n-roll collection ought to have a decent supply of Fleetwood Mac and this album will meet the needs of most of the fans.  I'll just need to get out my old Rumours album to listen to \\"The Chain\\" as well as to see that hot picture of Stevie Nix on the back-- Yowsa!
B000001EAQ|5.0|As fresh now as it was then. I love all that pulsating electronica & wayward experimentation. Turn this album up really loud and lose yourself in it! BUY IT!!  <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|because Abbey Road is one of the greatest rock CD's ever.  It still amazes me that a group that has already decided they are breaking up right after the record is released can stay focused enough to make such an incredible CD.  John was not really in the band mentally any more, focusing on Yoko, George was fed up with not getting enough songs, and Paul seemed to be annoying everyone with his desire to control everything.  However they put aside these differences to make this final album.  Here's a track by track review: <br /> <br />Come Together- 10/10- My favorite Beatles song of all time.  I love the swamp-bass rythm to it, and John's voice is in top form.  It also has some nice guitar-work by George.  I also see a lot of meaning behind it, as a kind of a peace song to stop the war.  I know John didn't mean it like that, but I always take that meaning from it.   <br /> <br />Something-9/10- Harrisons finest song, a love song to his wife Patti, has a nice smooth rythm and Harrison sings better than I've ever heard him sing before, normally I don't love his voice.  Overall, I feel it is an amazing song but a little overrated. <br /> <br />Maxwell's Silver Hammer- 9/10- The others were pissed off at Paul because it took a whole 3 days to record.  It's a very good song and has some of McCartney's best lyrics.  John wasn't even at the Silver hammer recording sessions. <br /> <br />Oh! Darling-8/10- Paul had to make hi voice sound like he had been performing for a week to sing this.  It's an excellent tune, just I agree with John when he said he could sing it better. <br /> <br />Octapus's Garden-10/10- Paul wrote this for Ringo's contribution, and it's probably the best I've heard Ringo sing.  It's a catchy, enjoyable song that grows on you.   <br /> <br />I Want You (She's So Heavy)-10/10- a real rocker by John with great guitar and George's synthesizer work at the end.  Right behind Come Together as the best on this album. <br /> <br />Here Comes the Sun-10/10- A beautiful song by George about spring coming out after winter, a light at the end of the tunnel idea.  You know how I said I like George's voice best on Something, well I take that back, it's even better here.   <br /> <br />Because- 9/10- A great psychadelic tune, I think it starts out fantastic, but is too short and kind of declines towards the end of the song.   <br /> <br />The rest of the album is pure genious.  It is all bits and pieces, not real songs, but they all flow into each other seamlessly.  You need to listen to it to understand it.  This is a must have.   <br /> <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|Rather than give you a summary of the plot, I'm going to give you a few reasons why this was a great movie.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about this movie was how much time you spend choked-up trying not to shed a tear because it's just so emotional.<br /><br />The second thing is that a lot of movies over the last few years have tried this whole bouncing plot order. Telling it backwards, telling it in pieces, sometimes not even telling it at all. This movie just comes together. It just makes sense. You're not flopping back and forth in order to put the pieces together - you're looking back on a relationship in a man's mind how you might look back on your own relationships. It's really very clever how they orchestrated this.<br /><br />The other major concept that made this a great movie was the ending. Whenever you watch a somewhat sad romantic movie, from the very beginning you are yearning for a happy ending that will give you closure. A lot of movies lately have killed the happy ending in order to be different. Man on Fire comes to mind. But at the same time, movies like that are made because we are somewhat tired of the cliche \\"they lived happily ever after\\" ending. This movie gives you closure without the sappiness, the happy ending without the sunset. In other words, you get exactly what you need in order to walk away satisfied - nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />Jim Carrey was exceptional in this movie. If you don't like the movie for any other reason, you should appreciate it for how much heart he put into this role.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a feel-good movie that is different from all the rest.
B0000047CX|5.0|No! I'm not \\"in love\\" again. I am rich. I rediscovered this music and these songs - but the way they were meant to sound. I'm the luckiest person in the world to have discovered composers, musicians, singers who put their own egos aside so that the music - and only the music - could be the star. I have certainly heard others perform these songs and melodies, but it wasn't until I found this music the way it was meant to be played that my heart and soul perked up. The singing is deceptively understated, as is the music itself. The sound of the Portuguese language is music onto itself and I recommend to my English speaking friends \\"in love\\" that they listen to the lyrics in Portuguese, as well as in English (as they deserve to be heard that way). A funny thing; when I was married (in the 1970s) and I was asked by the band what song I would like to choose as \\"our\\" song, I picked \\"Wave.\\"  Isn't it amazing that I never heard of Antonio Carlos Jobim until only a few weeks ago (and I was married to a Jazz pianist, to boot). Now that I'm listening to his music the way it was meant to be heard I can't get enough of it.  It has enriched my life in a way that can't really be expressed in a short review written in English.  I'm in love all over again! __Shari Gellman-Dince
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I remember watching most of Live Aid on television in the UK in 1985.  It was a the most advanced idea of its time and raised a huge amount of money for Ethiopia and the famine.  The best bits for me were the Freddie Mercury and Queen set, also classics like Sting and Dire Straits.  If you remember Live Aid, you need to own this DVD set, you won't regret it.
6301763041|1.0|The glory days are long gone.  Serial Mom, Cecil B Demented, Crybaby, A Dirty Shame....Maybe John Waters should make independent art films.  He went to the big studios and hasn't made a decent film since.  Shame, I will always be a John Waters admirer but the last several films he made just don't cut the mustard.  Melanie Griffith, Kathleen Turner, Johnny Depp, in a John Waters film?  Come on, bring on the un-knowns, or maybe make a film with every old Dreamlander that is still around!  \\"I can get ya a job at the baths Mary\\"...Ernie where are you?  What's next John?
B0001AP12G|1.0|When is somebody gonna tell these people that 'Music Stars' should have MUSICAL TALENT!!??!! You know, there was a time when you couldn't get a Grammy unless you PLAYED AN INSTRUMENT (and were good) or could sing, or write MUSIC (not just 'beats')  Think about it 10 Grammys ...for this [...] You mean there isn't some young Stevie Wonder out there...or Nat King Cole...Or Miles Davis? Why are we buying this [...]
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Does this leave out a lot of the Beatles best songs?  Yes, it does.  But is there a better album to introduce you to the Beatles?  No, I don't think so.  Sure, the anthology sets go into more detail and have a better selection, but you need to buy all of them, which is quite expensive.  This is an inexpensive single album.  I don't care for much of there early stuff, and this CD gives you the highlights of them.  Then come some of their later hits, but most of their best songs were not number one hits and therefore have been neglected.  However, this is the album that got me addicted to the Beatles, and I think it can do the same for you.  I would reccommend first buying this CD, then if you like it at all, every album from Rubber Soul all the way to Let it Be.  Magical Mystery Tour and Let it Be may not be necessary unless you're a real fanatic.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Music lovers, prepare to meet your match - it is hard to find any album that boasts to be as large as this one.  While this album takes back from the more metal approach of previous albums and boasts of the outstanding production value brought on by the Phoenix Orchestra (which was used by Pip Williams for the Lord of the Rings movie scores), the album still is an engrossing listen on repeat for time on end.  The lushous mix of Tarja's vocals, when combined with the masterful arrangements of Tuomas and unity of the bands playing helps make this an album to remember for any music fan.    As for the songs, Dark Chest of Wonders is an example of the superb arrangement - the mix of the orchestra with choirs, gorgeous vocals by Tarja, and impressive sound overall is to die for.  The album doesn't stop right there though, as most would, with the introduction of the second surprise, Wish I Had an Angel.  For those who love electronica & industrial will love this song easily, as it is a genre breaker with Marco's & Tarja's duet, a steady beat characteristic of techno, great guitar riffs & use of the background orchestra, and excellent panning.  Music lovers might expect more of the same variety from the first two songs, but are misled with the third song, a slower song featuring an amazing arrangement - Nemo surprises deeply with its use of primarily Tarja's vocals in a dispassionate way throughout most of the songs to set the mood, and to bring the piece to fruition through the second half in drawing that lack of passion into a yearning for more with a \\"fuller\\" voice.  The fourth song, Planet Hell, is also a nice song of the metal variety.  However, another bombshell is dropped with Creek Mary's Blood, and epic song that makes full use of the orchestra and Tarja's vocals.  Dead Gardens is another delightful song, and Romanticide is more candy for those who like Planet Hell, except featuring Tarja's voice in her full range of skill in singing and shifting styles within thesong.  However, the ninth song, Ghost Love Score, is not to be dismissed - it is a full-blown song, pulling no stops in its over the top arrangement, orchestration, choirs, and band's playing ability.  The album winds down with the Finnish song Kuolema Tekee Taijteilijan, a very nice and melancholy song...but then the (original release) album ends with a bang with the choral assault of Higher Than Hope, which boasts of great use of the acoustic guitar, choir, and of course, the band.    The bonus two songs, Live to Tell the Tale and White Night Fantasy are not bad in themselves, but in an album in which the orchestration helps define most of the songs, these just sound underwhelming.  However, they are nice listens, and Live to Tell the Tale has a catchy melody.  They are different from the previous songs though, and enjoyable on their own merits.    Overall, this is easily one of the most addicting albums of all time - my music collection boasts of around 30,000 songs, and this album gets a listen several times a week because it is that good. For those who love music in general, and don't confine their tastes/preferences to just one genre should appreciate this album greatly, because it is a musical dream that is seldom realized.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|The dream theater I know and love id gone never to return.. frankly speaking anybody who dares comparing a masterpiece such as \\" Images and words\\" with this last piece of work is not sane and should get immediate treatment ..  <br />If you wanna know what Dream is about stop at \\"falling into inifinity\\" ( Hell's kitchen is just unbelievable !!) because everything after is just crap... there is no emotion like there could have been in songs such as \\"Space dye west\\" or \\" Wait for sleep\\" and it basically sounds more like Metallica than the dream I used to know..there is no justification for technical stuff anymore. For me this album is another proof that Dream has lost his identity throughout the years to become a pop band with absolutely nothing original. ( + James Labrie is burned...he cannot sing live anymore ). <br />So if you really wanna know what Dream is all about ( my opinion at least) go for a  couple of their previous songs to give you an idea of how bad Dream has become. Here it is : Learning to live, Surrounded, Erotomania, The mirror, Voices, Space dye West and THE MASTERPIECE : Change of seasons.. this is, loosely, what they'll be remembered for.
B000002BSG|5.0|Jamiroquai brings up the flavor of '70s Disco back to the 90s. And though many call his music acid jazz, I agree that a more accurate term would be 'neo-disco.'  Just check out the album from start to finish, with the exception of tracks 8 and 9, which have some aborigine australian instrumentals, and the rock steady of track 6. 'Cosmic girl,' 'Virtual Insanity,' 'Alright,' You are my love,' and the title track are pure funky disco groove molded in such a way the 90s audience can digest it. I haven't heard Jamiroquai's other albums, but as far as this one goes, it certainly is worth the time you'll take on burning it or the money to buy it. <br />
6305127689|5.0|Well, what can I say other than I wanna be the best of the best! After seeing this film, I defiantly wanna join up, especially if there's guys like tom cruise around!!! Fit or what? Better than officer and a gentleman, who many people compare this film to.  <br />Its an classic example of the good stuff that came from the 80's, so good infact people of my age are willing to watch it.  <br />With excellent aerial photography and a romantic storyline, this is still one of the best films around. <br />the best part though, was most definatly the volleyball sceen. i would! <br /> <br />
B0006SSOHC|1.0|This movie was a waste of time and energy. Filled with pointless, disturbing violence, it was made only worse by a flakey storyline and irritating characterisation. It just made no sense! Come on! a sick man in hospital organising gruesome killings so that the victims learn to appreciate life. Then he's lying still for over 7 hours pretendng to be dead (the guy with his brains blown out) so he observe his victims. Then at the end of the film he walks out of the room. This movie was sick, and I suspect only sickos would appreciate it. Why isn't it possible for people to ban these kinds of movies in the first place, - that glorify filth, murder & moral degeneration? An ungenerous review for a morally depraved and ungenerous film.
B00013RC9I|5.0|I've decided to call this review \\"the return...\\" because this is Air. I was very disappointed with the \\"10,000 hz legend\\", a try to be a rock band, which has no sound. In Talkie Walkie, every songs sound like the old air. The fresh, easy-going, optimistic (despite the slowlyness, What can i say about \\"ce matin la\\"... I really love to wake up with that song!!!!!) style.  <br />Here, I miss a song sung by a woman like \\"you make me easy\\", but anyway I'm very glad to have this album, and the special edition with a dvd makes it a really good treasure.
B000002KBU|5.0|While listening to some Ashlee Simpson thing the other day, because I couldn't get my hand to the radio dial fast enough to turn it, I thought, \\"Was Joni Mitchell as good as I remember? Were her lyrics as intelligent as I thought they were 25 years ago?\\"<br /><br />  The answer is yes on both counts. If you like contemplative lyrics, not stupid drivel; if you want to hear what a real voice sounds like, and not some studio-enhanced synthetic sound, this cd is for you. The only contemporary singer that comes close to Joni in style might be Norah Jones, and I still think Joni's better.<br /><br />  My favorite track is \\"Carey;\\" and it's no coincidence that when it came time to name my firstborn girl, Joni's lilting voice singing that name came to mind immediately.  However, the whole cd is remarkable--\\"A Case of You\\" is the most sensual song I've ever heard.
B000683VI4|5.0|Everthing has already been said about this movie, so I will not bore you with another summary. All I have to say is, that it is such a wonderful and moving movie about what real love should be like: from a summer teenage romance to full grown love - until the bitter end. <br />It was such a touching love story that even my husband joined me in the search for tissues while watching it... <br />So everybody in need for a \\"good\\" cry don't miss this movie !
6304711905|4.0|\\"Tombstone\\" is a strange creature.  It's loaded with more action than you can shake a stick at coupled with some rather long moments.  It has some great actors in it coupled with some not-so-hot ones.  It has one-liners that make \\"I'll be back\\" seem forgettable coupled with some hokey proclamations that come across as just silly.  In all, it's the perfect stew of good, bad, and ugly(pun intended).<br /><br />But that is what makes this film so great and deserving of \\"classic\\" status.  Painstaking accuracy was put into certain parts of the movie.  For instance, according to court records, the famed \\"gunfight at the O.K. Corral\\" lasted roughly thirty seconds.  Time that showdown in the film and see just how accurate it is on screen.  Read the famous \\"No Les, No More\\" epitaph on the tombstone of Lester Moore on Boot Hill.  See the sheer looks of terror on the faces of the townspeople.  These little things, while not very important by Hollywood's standards, are what give this film a sense of realism.<br /><br />On the other hand, Bill Paxton's characterization of Morgan Earp is laughable at times.  He is the weakest character in this film.  Ike Clanton, although he was pretty much a cutthroat chicken according to history, is assigned the unfavorable role of comic relief.  Powers Boothe is a little over-the-top as Curly Bill Broscius, and you have to admit that Kurt Russell seems to be a little TOO involved with his portrayal of Wyatt Earp.  Much like the accuracies of the picture, however, these little near-misses only add to the appeal of the flick.<br /><br />The best portrayal of any character in this flick has to be Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday.  He plays the guy with a devil-may-care attitude.  He has a deathwish, which makes him deadlier than anyone else in the film.  Those who have studied the history of this complex man understand that once the Yanks basically took everything from him and he contracted TB, he really had no reason to live.  I think that Kilmer captured this aspect of Holliday to a tee.  His relationship with \\"Big Nose\\" Kate was rough, and I think that the actress who portrayed her in \\"Tombstone\\" is perhaps a little too attractive than pictures of the real Kate reveal, but she does very well in the role.  Sam Elliot, as always, is perfect in this film.  He plays the eldest Earp, Virgil.  He also seems to have his head on the straightest.  In all, the majority of the cast does a superb job in this film.  The wooden characters, most notably Paxton, however, still manage to play an important role in making this film great.<br /><br />As far as the accuracy issues are concerned, this movie is rather accurate and probably the most accurate account of what really happened based on court papers.  Many people laugh at some of the action in the film, but most of it really happened.  To this day, people argue over who actually killed Johnny Ringo.  Odds are that in a man-to-man gunfight, Earp wouldn't stand a chance against Ringo, so the legend of Holliday coming to save the day does hold some weight.  No one really knows Holliday's final words, but \\"That's funny,\\" seems fitting.  When watching a film based on actual events, keep in mind that some creative changes were added to move the story along.  Also, when dealing with the Wild West, remember that dimestore novels made men into legends.  A common cattle thief can become a Billy the Kid, and even poker hands can get tagged as a \\"Dead Man's Hand.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this film is the perfect mix of accuracy, legend, good, and bad.  It isn't the best Western film ever made, but it definitely ranks in the top ten.  Add it to your collection today.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I'd give it five stars, but we all know that this film doesn't have as much widespread appeal due to the fact that it is a Western.er captured this aspect of Holliday to a tee.

0792165020|4.0|There was a movie here, with Matt Damon? I didn't notice it. Mr. Law is perhaps the finest young male humanoid to currently walk the planet and I was distracted.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the movie. I was kidding up there. It is actually a pretty watchable movie about a reprehensible character who pursues then attempts to replace Dickie Greenleaf (our Mr Law). The character, Tom Ripley, who is played by Matt Damon, is an interesting study but the motivation for his behavior is not at all defined. This is in contrast to Dickie's motivations which are positively flayed in front of our eyes. Overall, the movie was a bit disturbing but marred by either the lack of details about Tom's motivations or the inability of Matt Damon to project whatever exposition there was. The sets were really well done as far as I can tell (never having travelled in Europe in the 50's). Very beautiful, very evocative. The acting is good throughout with a notable nods to Gwyneth Paltrow who excels in these kind of films and Jack Davenport as the sweet and loving Peter. The homoerotic content was a surprise to me but what do you expect, it's Jude Law after all. Oh, to dip MY fingers!!
B000683VI4|5.0|There are some films that have touched me very deeply and have immediately become a favorite for life. This is one.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|This is very possibly the most depressing movie I have ever seen, and never intend to see again, which I give three stars because I neither liked it nor disliked it. I say this because despite the fact that it is a well made movie, and has a good story, I could never sit through this again and not cry, and I don't cry very often.  I have never seen a movie that is so powerful.  All of the actors and actresses do amazing jobs, and the plot is astonishing.  It focuses around four doomed people, who you grow to like, and then they all fall into a spiral of their own self-destruction.  The entire movie is based around the downward spiral of these four people, and if you ever consider doing drugs, watch this movie, and if you are a true masochist, watch it twice, something I certainly never intend to do.
B00018D3JQ|4.0|These songs are all modern classics of the new wave period in British music which have been reinterpreted in bossa nova and sixties jazz style. Many would cringe at this idea but all music borrows and develops from other music and I really enjoyed this cool compilation. Most of the songs lend themselves to this reinterpretation in fine style. The songs I found least satsifying were the Public Image Limited and Dead Kennedys songs as they tend to break the easy flow and beautiful melancholy of the other songs on the album. The best songs are \\"I Melt With You\\" and \\"In a Manner of Speaking\\". These two would not be out of place on an Astrud Gilberto album. The special edition has two additional songs.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Well, I mean Oh my God, I just finished to watch it and this is certainly not Your average movie - this is not something for Your friday evening date. This is a dark, difficult and sometimes very shocking movie, full of sadness and suffering. DO NOT BELIEVE the regular press reviews! Watch it and make up Your mind. You can love it (like me) or hate it, but believe me, You will not be bored - and You will NOT forget it easily. And I really hope to see Ashton Kucher and Amy Smart in more movies. I shall watch their careers with great interest.
B000059T1E|5.0|With the recent passing of Traffic drummer Jim Capaldi, one can't help but put on an album by the band to pay a heartfelt tribute. That's exactly what this reviewer found himself doing in recent days. There is no better album to pay tribute to Capaldi and the band than the 1970 masterpiece \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\".<br /><br />Prior to the release of this album, Traffic had all but disappeared after three albums together. Band leader Steve Winwood had initially begun work on a solo project but when he enlisted the talents of fellow Traffic members Capaldi and wind player Chris Wood, the end result turned the solo project into a full-fleged band reunion. Not only that, the resulting album has since become one of the greatest rock albums of all time consisting of six tracks that make up a seamless cohesive whole.<br /><br />Beginning with the rolicking instrumental \\"Glad\\" and ending (originally) with \\"Every Mother's Son\\", the album runs through an eclectic mix of jazz-fusion, hard rock and gentle acoustic folk. The title track, a traditional folk song which dates back to the mid-1400's, is a genuine standout with Winwood and Capaldi's flawless vocal harmonies and Chris Wood's dancable flute. Elsewhere on the album, the band stretches itself in its versitility especially Winwood who plays most of or all the instruments on three tracks. There are also no additional musicians which means that what you hear is performed by just the three band members.<br /><br />Additionally, the remastered CD includes two additional tracks. While it is nice to have additional material from the same sessions added to the original release, the two bonus tracks do tend to act as mere filler on what originally was an 'all killer and no filler' release. \\"I Just Want You To Know\\" is a short piece in which the only lyric is the title itself sung over and over. \\"Sittin' Here Thinkin' Of My Love\\" isn't necessarily a bad song per se but does feel out of place with the rest of the material on the disc and it is easy to see why the track initially didn't make the final cut.<br /><br />All gripes aside, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" was and is still Traffic's best album. The musicianship of Winwood, Capaldi and Wood alongside Winwood and Capaldi's effortless songwriting is at its peak here. With Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi now no longer with us, this album serves as a fitting testament to just how great these players were.<br /><br />Definitely one of Traffic's all-time greatest.<br /><br />Rest in Peace, Jim.s easy to see why the track initially didn't make the final cut. <br />All gripes aside, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" was and is still Traffic's best album.

B0006OBPTA|5.0|\\"Wax On. Wax Off.\\" is probably one of the biggest catch phrases in American pop culture and we get to relive that and other fun moments in this box set.  I love the Karate Kid, even though I am definitely more partial to first and second one and I wasn't overly thrilled with The Next Karate Kid.  These movies are like Rocky for teenagers but thankfully there's only 4 of them!  <br />This belongs with the many other great teenage movies of the 80s and is highly recommended!
B0006IUDXA|4.0|MacGyver was one of the defining shows of my generation. When the show became popular, a lot of kids started carrying swiss army knives and suddenly, it was cool to learn about physics and chemistry and just being creative. Seeing it again after twenty years I have to say that Mac still hasn't lost his touch, with a non-gritty adventure style that doesn't fail to thrill.  <br /> <br />On the downside, the DVD set looks and feels like the episodes have been pulled out of archive and recorded on DVD with hardly any effort to enhance it. Thus the picture is a little red in hue (or I may just need to replace my old almost 20-year old TV) and there are some grains that can be seen. The sound is also in mono. For those who want a touch of nostalgia, this set is for you for it will definitely remind you of how the series looked like back then. Personally, it doesn't bother me that much. I'm in it for the action, so to speak. <br /> <br />Those looking for special features will find nothing of interest here. No documentaries, no commentaries, not even subtitles for catching all that scientific jargon that is scattered in bits and pieces throughout the series. I hope that Paramount will consider adding such bonuses to help us appreciate this very innovative series. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah, I'm NOT looking forward to the later seasons, where the series became too preachy about certain issues, particularly about the environment. I'm all for environmental conservation, but to turn one of my favorite secret agents (yes, people, he was a secret agent of sorts in the first seasons), into a liberal activist kind of lost his magic for me, even if I do support some of his agendas. If I wanted liberal rhetoric, I'd attend fora and symposia on them. <br /> <br />Overall, I'm very happy about the first season of MacGyver, despite the lack of special features.
078401213X|5.0|Darren Aronofsky could be called a film genius. Requiem for a Dream is considered to be one of the best movies of recent memory (and, from what I saw of it, I can agree), and has many of the same techniques as his previous film, Pi. Pi is one of those movies that you need to see many times in order to have everything sink in, but you don't really want to see it again. The images stick in your head, and it's a subconsciously terrifying experience. <br /> <br />Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius. He analyzes numbers, and soon recognizes a pattern in the stock market. But that doesn't satisfy him. He keeps on going, as people want to use his mathematical abilities for their own selfish reasons. Max struggles with his various mental and physiological problems as he's working with this-so much that if you watch it once you can't distinguish between reality and Max's mind. <br /> <br />Aronofsky makes this movie on parking meter money (less than $10,000), yet it's one of the most stylish movies of recent memory. Shot in black/white (there is barely any grey) with a type of vision that leaves edges to the imagination, Pi works in its own little world. With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works. The theories that the movie puts in your head are complete bull-honky, but they're presented in a way that you can't help believing. <br /> <br />Well acted all around, especially by Guellette, Pi is not for everyone. There's many disturbing moments, involving brains and power tools. The second-to-last scene, just so you know, was actually done, no special effects. Overall, Pi is a very good, trippy movie that's not for everyone. But if you're game, go for it! <br />
B0000024TT|2.0|Ok, <br /> <br />If I were to walk into the studio during the recording of this nonsense I would beckon Cohen to halt for a few minutes . I would approach him, put my arm around his neck and say, \\"Now Cohen, you're not actually taking this seriously are you? This is a JOKE, right?\\" <br /> <br />If he answers yes, then we are laughing together. If he says, \\"No,\\" well then this is the biggest collection of poorly written, vomit inducing, pretentious lyrics that have ever been put to music. The recording and music is subtley soothing and harmonious; even his voice (a poor man's crooner) is nice. However, the lyrics are flat out ridiculous and could have been written by any semi - literate on the street. There is NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING extraordinary about his writing. Shame, thought I might have discovered another musician whose work I could further explore. Instead I found a phony.
B000021Y77|5.0|Tom Tykwer has truly proven himself as the filmmaker to watch. The little known German director has produced a modern-day masterpiece; a dazzling technical film about how life consists of the decisions we make. <br /> <br />Lola (Franka Potente) receives a phone call from her boyfriend, Manni. (Moritz Bleibtreii) Manni accidentally leaves a bag carrying $100 000 on a train, which is picked up by a homeless man. This leaves Manni in quite a predicament. He is supposed to deliver the money to a gangster by noon, if he fails, then he is likely to be killed. Lola has twenty- minutes to save his boyfriend. Twenty short minutes to somehow find the money and get it to him. <br /> <br />Run Lola Run is a film you expect to see at a Independent film festival, or in a Professor's office at a film school. In no way do I mean that in a negative way, I mean not to intend that the film is of a lower standard with lower production values, rather that the film is a beautifully mastered technical film that uses every filmmaking technique in the book. It is refreshing to see a film like this in the midst of the commercialised, dry-cut, 'traditional' filmmaking that we see on the silver screen so regularly. <br /> <br />As stated before, the film attempts to use a wide range of filmmaking techniques to help get the director's meaning and vision across to the audience. Some of these include speed-up, instant replay, black and white, and even animation in some parts. <br /> <br />It may sound strange, but the film is twenty-minutes long. Well, not really, but it is in context. Tykwer focuses on the twenty-minutes that Lola has, and shows that twenty-minutes three times over, each time with small differences will affect the outcome of the characters. The danger with this kind of technique is that it can threaten to be repetitive. However, the new additions added by Tykwer are very clever and link in perfectly, which will have you gasping for more. <br /> <br />Tykwer wrote and directed this film, and while doing this, he never lost sight of his meaning. His meaning that he is trying to express is that life consists of the decisions we make. While watching the film, this becomes increasingly evident. He also likes to emphasise that time is against Lola during the film. This can be seen when a young woman walks past and Lola asks her for the time, the next shot shows a much older woman answering her question, hence showing the importance of time. <br /> <br />Franka Potente gave a good performance as Lola. Yet, it is hard to say that she was fantastic, because it is a role that requires a great deal of physical acting and we didn't get to know a lot about Lola, hence the film wasn't overly-focusing on her issues, rather her boyfriend's problem. The real standout performance from my point of view came from Moritz Bleibtreii. He actually took on a quite challenging role and pulls it off successfully. He achieves his objective of getting the audience to feel sympathy for the position that he is in. <br /> <br />Run Lola Run is without a doubt, one of the best technical films ever made. A profound, exciting, new age masterpiece that has well and truly left its mark on the film industry. <br /> <br />
0141301155|5.0|As amazing as this book is, I don't think that it's the best work by Roald Dahl. But after the movie was released (and a movie remake will be released later this year), it is certainly his best-known book, and it deserves every bit of the attention its received.  <br /> <br />Charlie Bucket is the only child in a family that's so poor that they all look forward to Sunday, when he, his parents, and his four grandparents all get an extra serving of cabbage soup. Charlie's life takes a turn for the better when he, along with four other children from around the world, wins a ticket that allows him entrance into the magical and mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory. Wonka has been turning out delicious treats for decades from behind a complete veil of secrecy, and the guided tour is receiving international media coverage. Once inside, Charlie, the other four children (each of whom is nasty in their own particular way), and their parents find that the factory is filled with both wonders and dangers that must be navigated by one who is pure of heart.  <br /> <br />This is a grand unveiling of all of the elements which mark Dahl's work. The imaginative storyline, the dark humor, the wacky rhymes and the strong identification with a good-hearted child protagonist are all in evidence. Readers who have grown up seeing the movie first might be surprised at some of the differences between the two; no movie made in the seventies could have possibly depicted some of the wonders that Dahl has dreamed up. <br /> <br />This wonderful book has become a staple of childhood, and no one should deprive their child of the fun that reading it will provide.  <br />
B00004XPPB|5.0|You know it really shows what a Class-A type of guy Pacino is (don't get me started on how much he is a bad ass, I love the guy!) he humbles himself from going from the top mobster ever (Michael Corleone) to a  mere soldier (Lefty Ruggerio). Awesome acting, captivating story, Depp does an remarkable job as Pistone, I highly recommend the film.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|needless to say due to the title of my review i genuinely think this is one of the best albums ive ever heard... and kudos to others who think the same...however to some who may think that some of the songs lyrics are \\"stupid\\" i want to know, do you really listen to serious songs all the time? sometimes its refreshing to have a song that is light and not too deep!  <br /> <br />anyway thats besides the point. gavin degraw is one of the best singer/songwriters i have ever had the pleasure to encounter. not only do the songs sound good, but the lyrics are insightful, simple and fresh. this is one of the only albums that i cant get sick of. after numerous play i have come to the conclusion that he is to be placed in the category with the likes of Jason Mraz and Billy Joel. <br />an amazing talent and undeniable charm, gavin degraw is to be thanked for this outstanding album that simply outdoes most modern music. <br />if you have good taste in music, <br />BUY CHARIOT NOW!
0061015725|5.0|Good as it is, the movie \\"Terminator\\" is obviously science fiction. Cyborgs are way beyond today's science, and time travel may be downright impossible. But how close could a writer get to \\"Terminator\\" using only technology that is available today, or will be within a few years? The result might well look a lot like \\"Prey\\". Crichton draws on his wide knowledge of current scientific developments to paint a terrifying scenario of what could happen, very soon, when greed and commercial ambition dictate cutting a few corners to get to market first.<br /><br />Take some leading-edge nanotechnology, blend with software agent algorithms, sprinkle on some fairly standard biotech, and optimise for the requirements of the military. To anyone who knows a bit about software, that is a prescription for something you don't want anywhere on the same planet with you - but the protagonist of \\"Prey\\" finds himself up close and personal with. Crichton skilfully feeds the reader just enough information to keep the tension building steadily, but holds back a few devastating surprises.<br /><br />On the downside, as with so many techno-thrillers, the end seems to come rather suddenly, and one or two really intriguing aspects of the plot are never fully explained. That may be the price of writing a novel that depends so heavily on technical riddles: when the action is done, it would be out of place to go on and wind up the lecture. Still, I for one far prefer novels that teach me things I didn't know before.
B0001AP12G|3.0|It's funny that Kanye doesn't see the difference education makes in a person's life when the evidence is right there on his CD. Look at the facts: Kanye drops out of college in his freshman year, and then goes on to write \\"Jesus Walks.\\" Had Kanye actually gotten an education, he might've never written that song. Only uneducated people, that is, those who are unable to think critically about the world, believe their lives are controlled by supernatural forces. 'The devil is trying to bring me down?' Unbelievable. Then again, I probably only wrote this review because a spell was cast on me, or there's a demon living inside my body, right Kanye? You should've stuck out those college years, my friend. It's not too late, though, you can be saved: just pick up a book and try reading it. When you're done, pick up another and do the same thing. Actually, there's this place called the library where you can do this all the time, and shake off some of those unexamined beliefs that have been handed down to you. It'll drive off some of that fear, too, which springs from living in a world that you know nothing about. Just an idea.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Media hype follows the Strokes like a hungry dog. But with its classic-inspired uptown-grit rock, it's undeniable that while they aren't exactly the saviors of modern rock'n'roll, they are a solid and enjoyable chunk of it. \\"Is This It\\" offers the answer to its own drawled question -- this is it, and it is worth checking out.<br /><br />A pounding rhythm and several variations of the question \\"Is this it?\\" kick off the title track, a swaying rock melody. Following it are a catchy, gritty collection of lo-fi rockers. The uniquely-named Julian Casablancas drones in a delicious monotone through the fast-moving \\"Barely Legal,\\" the uneasy \\"Leave Me Alone,\\" the deceptively simple-sounding \\"Last Night,\\" and the skipping percussion of \\"Hard to Explain.\\"<br /><br />Expect to hear echoes of legendary bands like the Velvet Underground, the Stooges and Television. However, the Strokes give this retro sound a twenty-first century twist of New Yorker ennui and art-rock underpinnings. And a lot of attitude. A lot of good rock is half swagger, and the Strokes have their sneery swagger down to a minor art form.<br /><br />Due to the lavish praise heaped on the Strokes, they've become a love-'em-or-hate-'em phenomena. But just ignoring the hype and listening to the music works best -- it shows off their energetic style in full. Okay, they are not groundbreakers -- but at least they scuff the ground that has already been trodden.<br /><br />Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond's complex guitar riffs are the gems of this album -- they drone, they skip, they reverberate, and they sear. Nikolai Fraiture's bass is a good dark edge, and Fabrizo Moretti's drumming sounds like little strikes of lighting -- fast, sharp and completely out of the blue.<br /><br />Julian Casablancas has now become the reference point for male singers who sing in a bored monotone, as if too jaded to show emotion in a song. The only time he breaks out of it is in \\"Barely Legal,\\" where he almost sounds excited at times. \\"I wanna steal your innocence/To me my life it don't make sense,\\" he says, and sounds like he means it.<br /><br />The Strokes are far from being the saviors of rock'n'roll. But their punk-tinged New Yawker rock is still some pretty good music, and \\"Is This It\\" remains a likable if spotty debut.ds excited at times. \\"I wanna steal your innocence/To me my life it don't make sense,\\" he says, and sounds like he means it.  <br />  <br />The Strokes are far from being the saviors of rock'n'roll.

0385501005|5.0|That is the first word that came to my mind as I finished Mike Gayle's `MR. COMMITMENT'.  I never imagined that I would describe a chick-lit novel written by a man as being \\"perfect\\" but `MR. COMMITMENT' truly was just that.  Mike Gayle did not fall short in any aspects of this book, the plot was well though out, it was not totally predictable, the characters were all well developed and he did not rush the ending, the book made me laugh out loud at times and brought a tear to my eyes at others.  All of these things together, in my opinion, make for an ideal book, one that you just don't want to end.<br /><br />`MR. COMMITMENT' gives the reader a hilarious yet touching view of relationships from the male perspective.  The story of comedian Ben Duffy begins when his girlfriend of four years Mel wants to take their relationship to the next level and get married.  They are twenty-eight years old and know each other inside and out so in her opinion marriage is the next logical step.  However, marriage is the furthest thing from Duffy's mind.  He loves Mel more than anything in the world but he doesn't fee that he can commit to anything more that two weeks together at a vacation resort.  So when Mel brings up marriage Duffy wants to be able to commit and knows that it is indeed time but just cant bring himself to make a lifelong commitment to Mel.  So they decide to go their separate ways after which Duffy soon realizes that his fear of commitment may have cost him the love of his life.<br /><br />I didn't expect to love this book as much as I did but Ben Duffy's journey into the land of adulthood was completely absorbing and getting the story from a male perspective was a refreshing way to shake up the genre a little bit.  Mike Gayle is definitely giving chick-lit icons such as Ms. Green and Ms. Fielding a run for their money!  Well done Mr. Gayle!
B00005NNMK|1.0|This is probably the most sinister of all 80's 'metal' albums.  I agree that it is not fair to call this a metal album, not because of the band;s nationality but because the music is pure drollish hack-pop that weeds its way into your brain like the most lethal of cancers.  I grew up in the era when this disk saw heavy radio play, and even at that tender age I was fortunate to realize what drivel this was.  No matter what your musical taste I would warn you to steer way clear of this.  Contracting the plague may be worse than listening to this album but not by much.
B00003CXBH|3.0|When it comes to three talented performers as Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson, each one of us has a specific film role or feature film they have been in that comes automatically to our minds when we hear their names. For De Niro, he has benefited quite profitably from teaming up with director Martin Scorsese decades ago in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, among others, as well as appearing in the Godfather series, the politically controversial Wag the Dog, and The Deer Hunter. Jeremy Irons is probably best known for his villainous voice role in The Lion King and his role opposite Bruce Willis in Die Hard with a Vengeance. And Liam Neeson's star has risen in part to critical praise of his roles in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List and Kinsey, as well as more mainstream hits as Star Wars: Episode I and Love Actually. But few would even fathom remembering the film of which all three of these actors share in common - The Mission. <br /> <br />The story for The Mission adheres presently to the historical events of the era and actions that would have taken place during the mid-1700s, specifically around the year 1750 CE, but in doing so the interests of its audience are alienated. Be it either from an unwillingness to take creative chances with the storyline or the lack of serious character development amongst the lead roles, The Mission more often then not bores its public into submission. Unless you happen to be genuinely invested within the time period in which this film is set against then it will be quite difficult to remain concerned for the outcome of the events onscreen. But the purpose of The Mission far exceeds the level of merely expressing to its audience the heart-wrenching tale of the turbulent changes taking root amongst the native Indian populations of Latin America during the mid-1700s but instead uses allegory to connect to after effects caused by the Treaty of Madrid of 1750 and the political turmoil within the same region in the 1980s, something that would hit home with its target audience. In reference back to the historical records of the time, in the year 1750 AD the countries of Spain and Portugal came to an accord in which they signed a document called the Treat of Madrid. The agreement allowed Spain to retain all territory west of modern-day Uruguay and Portugal kept the Amazon, Mato Grosso, Goias, and Rio Grande do Sul. <br /> <br />Robert De Niro's engaging and captivating performance as Rodrigo Mendoza, the former mercenary searching through redemption in the tropical missionary built by the Jesuit order, has to certainly be one of the most surprising and magnificent roles of his exhaustive film career. Glancing back toward Robert De Niro's promising career during the 1980s sincerely demonstrates how far the enduring talent has fallen over the years with roles in such horrid features as Godsend and Hide & Seek. The struggle for the film's audience is that they are directed emotionally to be supportive or sympathetic toward Rodrigo, especially near the end of the film, but clearly do not understand as to why they should feel this way. Seeing as how Rodrigo never expresses exactly, either to himself or to others within the Jesuit order, as to what he true feelings or intentions are toward a particular course of action, it is quite understandable as to why this would an inconvenience to the audience's way of thinking. The lack of character of development, which truthfully is not limited merely to De Niro's character, leaves far too many question unanswered. Beyond being merely family-related, why does Rodrigo feels as horrible as he does about killing his brother having been a mercenary most of his adult life, and thus having inflicted such brutal punishment, or worse, on a regular basis? Why does he agree to Father Gabriel's act of penance to begin with? What reason does he have for joining the Jesuit order? If for spiritual purposes then why does he withdraw back to his former way in the end,be it though for a better cause and purpose. <br /> <br />Jeremy Irons' Father Gabriel is constructed in almost the exact same fashion as De Niro's Rodrigo in that the assumptions made of the character's actions are left pretty opened ended, which does not benefit the audience's understanding the film's spiritual message. In any event though, Irons' solid performance is positively convincing and connects with the film's audience more thoroughly then any other role, a statement truly deserving of praise. But if there was choice as to which character in the film should have been cut from the final reel it would undoubtedly be Liam Neeson's Fielding, a member of the Jesuit missionary order. The dilemma with his character is that he serves no actual purpose, at least none that has any lasting effects on the proceedings of the rest of the film, and contributes little if anything to The Mission's overall thematic atmosphere. Beyond a few albeit brief appearances in the two-hour feature, the role of Fielding should have been designated as nothing more then a mere cameo for Neeson rather then a supporting role as it does nothing of the sort. <br /> <br />The Mission's musical composition, scored and conducted by Ennio Morricone, is truly a sight to be seen, or in this case heard, as it is truly difficult to categorize accurately unless it has been experienced personally. It ranges from purely elevated grandeur, flowing majestically as the swift guided strokes of the native Indian oarsmen convey the Cardinal through the Amazonian jungle to their mission-village, only to dabble into fits of the hysterically, unintentionally of course, awful. There should be no rational excuse for Morricone to have done this seeing as how it goes about distracting the audience from the course of the film, reoccurring every so often out of nowhere that no one can help but be confused when they hear it. <br /> <br />Despite benefiting exceedingly from a well-intentioned, if not an often disconcerted, storyline and proverbial sequences of dialogue, the pacing of the film seems rather off, convincing the audience that it is longer then its actual two hour and fifteen minute time length should suggest. Furthermore, The Mission's numerous obscure, and ultimately unnecessary, uses of particular sequences or character actions should have never found their way into the final version of the film. For example, what was with the little native Indian child tag along after Rodrigo? What particular purpose did he serve within the storyline that the other children did not? And was anyone else confused, or surprised, when his laughter sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks? This might have more to say about the rather primitive sound innovations, from the modern perspective, of cinema within the 1980s then anything else but still it could have been dealt with differently then it was. And then there was the scene in which, as the Jesuit missionaries paddle their way toward the missionary village, a random tree along the river collapses into the water and then Irons makes a passing comment about it before quickly moving on. Was this truly necessary? The audience may receive somewhat of a chuckle from it but for obviously the wrong reasons, if the director had any for its inclusion. <br /> <br />Overall, The Mission, be it a historically accurate depiction of the imperialistic plunder of South America within that time period, ultimately makes poor use of its genuine storyline and conventional dialogue pieces in part to its rather melancholy pacing and anti-climatic conclusion. Also, the serious lack of character development, specifically concerning Robert De Niro's Rodrigo Mendoza, prevents the audience from making an emotional investment with the actions occurring onscreen, thus eliminating the mood of excitement or intrigue from the finale. Undoubtedly The Mission is an exceptional piece of little known cinema and should be viewed for its breathtaking cinematography and philosophical exchanges of discussion, but its sloppy editing techniques and lapses in scriptural genius within the screenplay ultimately prevent it from achieving the pinnacle of achievement amongst the movie-going public.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I happened upon the music of \\"At the Drive In\\" late in their career and was duly impressed, especially by \\"Vaya\\", arguably their finest release.  When I heard about The Mars Volta and this album I went out and bought it emediatly with a high degree of excitement.  My first listening was full of disapointment and I skipped through a number of the tracks in disinterest.  However, this album began to grow on me in a huge fashion somewhere within the second, third, and fourth listenings.  I now rate it among the top in my rock collection and would not part with it for anything.  I have never had an album grow on me so quickly and so suddenly.  Something about the raw musicianship and free songcraft was elusive at first but jumped out in a big way upon further inspection.  I would recommend this album to literally anyone, whether they know it is good for them or not.
B0002XDODU|5.0|\\"Reise, Reise\\" is Rammstein's fourth album since their last release in 2001 with \\"Mutter\\", and it goes to show Rammstein hasn't slowed down a bit. Rammstein continues with their signature combination of keyboards, heavy guitars, and (for the most part) deep vocals. \\"Reise, Reise\\" is much more keyboard driven than their previous titles as it features more keyboard solos than guitar solos. of course, they threw in a few breakdowns for good measure. I wouldn't say Rammstein continues to be a pretty aggressive band, since they really haven't had anything aggresive sounding since 1995's \\"Herzeleid\\" album (with the acception of slow, easier Seamann). \\"Reise, Reise\\" may not be the best entrance album for new Rammstein fans, though. The songs are significantly slower than, say, the likes of the militant sounding Links 2 3 4 or strange but heavy Zwitter. The album as a whole, however, is simply fantastic. The real significant songs on the album are Mein Teil, Keine Lust,and Amerika. This is a must have for Rammstein fans, and it's even worth a gander if your a new fan of Rammstein, though you may want to start with \\"Mutter\\".
B000005JA8|5.0|It's about more than just bucking convention, more than just free-form musicianship and more than just experimentation.  This album is just as compelling today as when it was first released because the artist succeeded at being musical which is a actually quite a rare feat.  It may not be musical in the same way that many listeners are used to but that only compounds its interest for me.  There was a real muse at work when these tracks were laid down.  So it happens to fly in the face of \\"popular music\\", so much the better say I.
B00004WG2F|4.0|Great performances by an all star cast and gorgeous cinematography highlight this often overwrought historical sudster.<br /><br />Aidan Quinn gives a spot on performance as the eldest of three turn-of-the-century brothers, with equally strong turns by Brad Pitt and Henry Thomas.  The burden of the picture rests on Pitt's often exposed muscular shoulders, but still it remains an ensemble piece.<br /><br />The Native American aspect to the story brings an added dynamic to this interesting tale.  Beautiful costumes and lighting, too...although the constantly changing (and obvious) wigs, wiglets, hairpieces, spirit-glue facials hairs and falls get a bit tiresome.<br /><br />There are also some gratuitous buttocks shots of Brad for his many admirers.  Julia Ormand, however, was not similarly objectified.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I first recieved this album over 10 years ago for my dad's ex-girlfriend, when I was 11. I loved it so much, and brought it to a party to play... I haven't seen it since. Since then, I've been really missing it, but never actually mustered up the complete desire to get it until tonight. Anyone who loves ballad rock will love this album. It has so much depth and so many layers, its just really a beautiful contribution to the music world. Music has degenerated so much since 90s rock. Its really a sad reality. If you're just getting into 90s rock, this is a perfect addition. Its not grunge, its not alternative - its sort of its own catagory. So, give this album a chance, you'll love it from beginning to end. My favorites are \\"Cherub Rock\\" \\"Quiet\\" \\"Today\\" \\"Hummer\\" \\"Rocket\\" \\"Disarm\\" \\"Mayonaise\\" And \\"Luna\\". I like them all, but these are the ones that really speak to me.

B00005JN0T|2.0|This movie is a tribute to Will Smith's ego. It hardly resembles the book.  It should be titled \\"I, Will Smith\\", starring Will Smith, co-starring Will Smith, and having a cast of some other people.  The plot is ridiculous, never really being established, and it goes down from there. With a little effort, it could have been a comedy instead of just being silly.
0385510454|4.0|This book definately took me on a ride. I expected a good thriller, albeit not a legal one. My expectations were not betrayed. Yes, sometimes the pacing could be better, but Grisham makes you forget that in his awesome descriptions of Bologna.  <br /> <br />The only thing that got me distracted while reading the book was the use of the Italian, and the immediate translation. I don't know Italian, and that was why I was constantly thrown out of the story.  <br /> <br />But all in all a great book to me.

B00003CWLF|4.0|This modern rendition of the 'The King and I' is not without its cinematic lacunae, but it's so captivating you'll gloss over most of them.<br /><br />It's 1862 and King Mongkut of Siam (Thailand) has hired a certain Mrs Anna Leonowens to be an English teacher to his 58 children. She stays there for five years and in 1870 publishes a book about her experiences, which predictably scandalizes British high society, and is considered a great betrayal by the Thai government and people.<br /><br />The film may be based on these diaries but sure it'd have been blasphemy to rely merely on barebone facts, so it liberally splices action, drama, romance, suspense, even fullfledged battles into the fray.<br /><br />We follow two broad arcs -- the platonic emotional connection that develops between the king and Anna, and the political backdrop against which this bond is set -- but the leitmotiv is one of change. Both our principals find themselves transformed beyond their own contexts by virtue of their acquaintance.<br /><br />Jodie Foster is clearly uncomfortable with her British accent as she mumbles her way through three-quarters of the movie, but it is probably her customary detachment in expressing emotion that befits Anna's charm in this film (if one could describe it thus) -- a certain air of arrogance, a misplaced conviction in her own superiority, the 'uncommon richness' of the British way of life, so on and so forth. The film doesn't patronize her character and the few crevices in her personality do come across as cultural idiosynchrasies that can now be looked upon as such, with the benefit of distance.<br /><br />Chow Yun Fat (a popular Hong Kong actor, you may know him from Crouching Tiger) is majestically imperious in his portrayal of the King caught between the throes of attraction and the cross he must bear as a conscientious ruler.<br /><br />Their romance is zestful but dignified, their chemistry palpable. His rueful admission of her as an equal and his tender submission to his own feelings of love towards her is masterful. There's even a waltz.<br /><br />One does wonder about his 26 concubines and 58 children though; they come across chiefly as garden props, we see them and they're there and that's all they do, part of the landscape. An unrelated sequence where a young daughter succumbs to ill health is quite plainly a tear-jerker thrown in for that sole purpose.<br /><br />Things then get dodgier on the political front. Anna's heroic rescue of Siam seems heavily contrived. No king with a couple brain cells or more would find himself mired in the sort of military faux pas that occurs here. Let's not spoil the suspense but there's a goofball insurrection that culminates in a positively cartoonish battle. Little surprise to me that Thai government chose to ban the film, not for groveling love of their monarchy but out of basic self-respect.<br /><br />These quibbles aside, the film is stunningly produced and well-worth seeing for the rest of us if only for the luxurious mantle in which it comes cloaked. The scenery is spectacular, with lush green mountain fields, grand palatial foyers draped in red silk, pillars etched in gold, even a long sweeping view of the royal steamboat on the river between the banks of a dense rain forest. The set and costume design are so sumptuous they'd have won Bertolucci's grudging admiration.<br /><br />Without doubt a heartily made epic and recommended with equal intensity if you're willing to go easy on the rigours of historical or cultural accuracy.submission to his own feelings of love towards her is masterful.

B000002UEB|5.0|This is one of the 1st CD's I bought back in the late 80's, when I finally decided to migrate my album collection to the \\"new\\" format. I heard 'Eyes of a Stranger' on the radio station once or twice and thought..hmmm!  <br /> <br />From my 1st listen, through my 100th, I was totally amazed at the story telling, the music and the depth of the CD. I honestly think this was the 1st CD I listened to 2 times in a row. It is now 15 years later, and the music is still fresh..I cant give this CD enough praise!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I bought \\"American Idiot\\" a few days ago, and though I had heard a few of the songs from it on the radio, I was completely unprepared for how incredible it is. <br /> <br />It's a \\"Concept Album\\" - a rock-opera really, and almost evangelical in nature (much like \\"Tommy\\", which could almost be considered a predecessor). It flows, not a single song could be considered a weak point. It retains some of the angst present in previous Green Day albums; though it's much more mature both musically and in lyrical content. I haven't totally figured every theme, though there's a great deal of frustration with post 9/11 America - maily a criticism of the mindless paranoia of the populace, rather than of the current administration (which I'm glad of, the latter is clich quite frankly - agree with it or not). <br /> <br />In short, it's an album where every song stands alone as enjoyable, but it's clearly meant to be listened to all an once; and when you do, I promise, you won't be disappointed. Its without a doubt the best album of the past few years.
B00005UWBQ|5.0|The Lost World was really good, JP 1 was almost as good, and JP 3 was okay. I don't have The Lost World yet, but I rent it all the time. The reason why I like this one the best is because of the T-Rex roaming the streets of San Diego.
B00006LSM3|3.0|Basically the Traveling Wilbury's featuring George Harrison. <br />Still worth adding to your collection. Overproduced to the max. Can't wait for the release of the 'bare essentials' acoustic version that George envisioned.  Listenable but disappointing in its realization.
0060589272|5.0|This is a story about a girl called Maria, who leaves her hometown in search of her dreams and how she does everything she can, to back her decision of persuading her dreams. One must read this book with an open mind and heart. It teaches us some of the invaluable lessons of life and love, ofcourse. I am a kind of lazy reader, but read this book more than once. This one is definitely a must have in your book collection.

B00005NWM3|3.0|Silver-Side Up is a cool cd if you are into bands like 3 door's down and you might find this interesting. It is probably Nickleback's best yet but, I know they can do better. Don't get me wrong I like the band but,there is other cd's out there that I would rather buy. The cd is an overall strong album with a few good songs and a few bad songs. Nickleback is one of those band tha look like they will have a strong future. It is up to you if you want to check it out it is totally up to you I'm just saying that is an average cd but, the band has potential!!! <br />
B00006AFUR|4.0|If you're looking for something different with a heavy rock sound, then this is it.  It has a futuristic, space like sound to it.  It has great production with mixing and sounds.<BR>The drummer is awesome and definitely above average.  He has many sounds coming out of his kit including some good sample stuff.  He uses alot of different time signatures to keep it interesting.<BR>The guitar and bass are heavy and slower moving than fast and frantic, there are no solo theatrics involved.<BR>Vocals and lyrics are good and again with a unique styling.<BR>The sound is very thick and layered.  I would doubt they will match this live, but the album is very good on the stereo.<BR>I've been waiting for a second release and hope they keep their unique direction and find some success.<BR>Highly recommend this album if you want to venture into some new and different heavy stuff.  I would find it difficult to make any similar comparisons.  Enjoy!
B000002JKA|5.0|first, let me start by saying that people think DT is way heavier than they actually are. they think they are really, very heavy, and even call them metal. im not dissin this CD or DT, cause they're awesome... i think ive been listening to bands like dark tranquillity and meshuggah and children of bodom for too long...who knows? who CARES? i dont. anyway... <br />this albums really good. musicianship is incredible. lyrics are deep and thoughtful. heres the lowdown:<br />6:00...5/5...when i first bough this album couple years back, this was the only song i could listen to, but then i listened to the rest of the album...<br />caught in a web...5/5...the next song i could only listen to. became an obsession, almost.<br />innocence faded...5/5...the last song i listened to over and over again before i picked this album up a couple months ago to really listen to it.<br />erotomania...5/5...proof of great musicianship. just as good as instrumentals by metallica, if not better.<br />voices...5/5...i might be a little generous on this song, but i really love it. little too long for this song though. <br />the silent man...5/5...little quick song thats really cool.<br />the mirror...3/5...ok, this is where the album goes little down hill for me. this songs ok, but not great.<br />lie...5/5...this ones good. that solo that john did...crap...that was incredible. gotta learn that one. anyway, another good song.<br />lifting shadows off a dream...5/5...easily the best song off the album. beautiful. <br />scarred...3/5...ok. its not that i dont like long songs, but this ones kinda boring.<br />space dye vest...4/5...another ok one. this is one of those albums where the first or second half is much better than the rest. this ones kinda too slow though. ok for once in a while. it kinda reminds me of schindler's list for some reason...<br />anyway, thats just my opinian. i HIGHLY recomend this album. i know i make it sound like its kinda boring, but its not. the songs i gave a 5 tomake up for the ok ones. believe me on that. it was my first dt album and first of many.
B0006399FS|1.0|I don't understand why so many music critics continue to lavish praise on U2. I don't hear anything new or exciting on \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\". It's tired,overdone,boring,bland,and pompous. I don't like one song on it. \\"Vertigo\\" sounds horrible to me,but it's the best they have to offer. \\"Yahweh\\" is one of the worst songs they've ever done. All the songs in between just put me to sleep. The best thing about trying to listen to the album is that it cures my insomnia. <br />Bono said he'd know it was time for U2 to hang it up when they did two bad albums in a row. He's lucky \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was a decent album or U2'd have to retire now. Actually,\\"Pop\\",\\"Zooropa\\",and \\"Bomb\\" have all been bad.  <br />I'm not going to listen to the hype any more. The critics who call every new U2 album the best one in years are always wrong. They've said it about every album since \\"Boy\\" and they've been wrong every time.
B00000JG41|5.0|I learned about this band when ripping on The Locust, whom I feel are completely untalented. Someone recommended this band and I have never been more pleased in my life. This album consists of the most calming, unique songs I've ever heard. I like lots of unique stuff like Frank Zappa and Mindless Self Indulgence, but this is something gold. When people say nobody has ever really pioneered this genre, I'm fine with agreeing with it. The only way one could possibly describe this album would be to say The Beach Boys in Space. I can die happy knowing I've listened to this band.
077106506X|5.0|This is my first book by Alice Munro.  I loved it!  It's so rare to read short-stories that are so well-crafted.  This book made me long for more information about each character yet, at the same time, you don't want to know...  You kind of want to imagine for yourself what their lives are going to be, or what really happened.  And that is the mark of a truly great short-story.<br />Read it!
B00067189O|5.0|KIND OF BLUE has been reissued so frequently that I fear something is amiss if a year goes by without a new and improved version popping up somewhere in the world.  This 2005 edition provides an audiophile surround-sound option that is compatible with regular DVD players (unlike the SACD version which requires special hardware).  On both 5.1 versions the sound is subtly widened while keeping the integrity of the original mix.  As a bonus option there is a 25 minute video documentary about the album, featuring interviews with prominent musical artists from different generations and genres.  All but the most knowledgeable Miles fans should find it to be an informative overview of arguably jazz's greatest album of all-time.      <br /> <br />In the documentary drummer Jimmy Cobb -- the only surviving participant -- stated that he didn't understand why KIND OF BLUE stands out above any of Miles' many other outstanding albums.  Perhaps it is because the user-friendly music satisfies the listener at whatever level they prefer. If you want to get emotively involved with the music, it leads you there. If you're a musician looking to pick apart the music, you'll discover a level of sophistication attained by very few. If you want to relax, the music is soothing on its surface. If you want to hear memorable improvisations, Miles and his sidemen lead the way by avoiding the use of cliched phrases. If you want to hear teamwork, the musicians know how to create together (when to play and when NOT to play). If you want something timeless, the music's freshness has no expiration date. Yet if you have a nostalgic twinge for the cool, acoustic jazz of the 1950s, this album will take you back in time.
B000002BFL|3.0|This is Bruce's should've, could've, would've record. There are some great lyrics throughout but he only achieves intimacy on  tracks like Across the Border and Dry Lightning where on others such as Sinaloa Cowboys and The Border his narration seems removed, almost voyeuristic like Lou Reed. It works for Reed but Springsteen requires honesty and connection for his songs to translate. The arrangements and production hurt the impact of the record as well. Bruce incorporates the E Street Band into these songs live to flesh out their arrangements and they truly shine in a live setting. If he tackles another acoustic record, I would like to see hime use them in the studio this way as well. Finally, if the record is ever remastered and reissued, drop the awful last track and include the acoustic version of Brothers Under The Bridge from Tracks as the album closer and you have a 4 to 4.5 star record because despite the shortcomings, the writing still comes through.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|While February is often not a great month for blockbusters, it is the season for the romantic comedy, what with Valentine's Day and all.  And every once in a while, the ever elusive GOOD romantic comedy shows up, with the right level of sweetness, humor, and drama to make good movie entertainment.  I am notorious for being hard on these sorts of films, but I do try to remain as objective as possible.  Will Smith's latest comedy, \\"Hitch\\" comes pretty close to being an excellent picture, romantic or otherwise, but just misses the mark.<br /><br /> Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens (Smith) or, as he is colloquially known, the Date Doctor, is a professional love consultant, if there is such a thing.  He teaches the Regular Joe how to be suave, cool, and get the attention of a desired female.  His latest client, a klutzy accountant named Albert (Kevin James), has fallen head-over-heels for the beautiful celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Personally, I would be wary of somebody with the same name as an allergy medication, but to each his own.  In any case, Hitch coaches Albert on the ways of dating and making first impressions, and Albert and Allegra seem to really hit it off.<br /><br /> But Hitch has his own love problems.  He's trying to catch the eye of a lovely (though highly cynical) gossip columnist named Sara (Eva Mendes), but through bad luck and some rather humorous accidents, he comes across as a total dipstick.  Or at least he SHOULD, but Sara finds him endearing anyway.<br /><br /> Hitch also hands out some free advice, apparently to the viewing audience, such as \\"ninety percent of what you're saying isn't coming out of your mouth.\\"  Your actions and body language can say more about you than anything you can.  So guys, take some notes at this one.<br /><br /> The thing I really appreciated about this movie was that even though he was basically setting up guys to score, Hitch had strong feelings about making good, solid relationships, rather than just one-night stands.  It's a good moral standard that is severely lacking in America in general and the entertainment industry in particular.  Hitch doesn't just teach guys how to impress the girls, he teaches them how to be nicer people in general.<br /><br /> Most comedies run at about an hour and a half, mainly because they run out of funny things to do after that.  But \\"Hitch\\" works at two hours because its story is complex enough, and the characters are endearing enough, to last that long on screen without seeming like a drag.<br /><br /> The only real flaw I could see was that the movie was perhaps a bit too sweet.  It's nice to see a so-called romantic comedy devoid of bathroom humor for once, but the whole warm-fuzzy thing got a little tiresome in places.<br /><br /> So, as a Valentine's Month (because that's really what February is) film, \\"Hitch\\" is all right.  It's got some nice platitudes, and an overall sweet theme, but all that sugar might be a little unhealthy.oral standard that is severely lacking in America in general and the entertainment industry in particular.

B000002J0B|5.0|Houses Of The Holy is Led Zeppelin's fifth album and their followup to the classic Led Zeppelin IV also known as Zoso. The band waited two years to release this album which while now commonplace in the music industry was considered an eternity at the time. While not containing as many classic tracks as Led Zeppelin II or IV, this is their most diverse collection and the last album they would release which was great from beginning to end.<br /><br />The album begins with its heaviest track \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" which spotlights Jimmy Page's distinctive solos and solid riffs and the creative bass work of John Paul Jones. This leads into the majestic ballad of \\"The Rain Song.\\" One of their greatest and most overlooked tracks, the track features one of Robert Plant's most emotional vocal performances and the inclusion of strings and keyboards which add a beauty to the song which is absent on the more famous \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\" The track \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" with its memorable acoustic intro is the most enduring track here and remains a staple of AOR radio. Then we get into previous uncharted waters as \\"The Crunge\\" is a great funk workout spotlighting the rhythm section of Jones and drummer John Bonham while \\"D'yer Maker\\" shows the band doing a remarkable job of dipping into reggae and being rewarded with a Top 20 hit. \\"The Ocean\\" is another great track featuring a memorable riff from Page which has been sampled by both the Beastie Boys on \\"She's Crafty\\" and by Plant himself on \\"Long Cool One\\" before shifting into an a capella vocal during the middle then finally breaking into a groove straight out of the '50s complete with doo wop vocals at the track's close. The remaining tracks, the slow and moody \\"No Quarter\\" and the mid-tempo rocker \\"Dancing Days\\", are also very good. This is the last classic album the band would release where everything worked as future albums such as Presence and In Through The Out Door were uneven efforts despite their eclecticism. Highly recommended.ism. Highly recommended.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|4.5 stars. <br /> <br />Well, once again I find myself asking: Has Roger Ebert lost his mind? He gave this film one and a half stars. That is, frankly, inane. He makes a comparison between this film and films with Adam Sandler, saying that you like an Adam Sandler film because Adam Sandler is in the film, and this is the type of film that falls into that category. <br /> <br />Wow. Was he on drugs? <br /> <br />He has certainly lost whatever edge he had when Gene Siskel passed away, and that's seen in so, so many films that he has reviewed since that sad day. I can't help but think that if \\"Siskel and Ebert\\" was still a show, if Siskel was still alive, that Ebert would have realized that this film isn't simply a stupid film about a character we're not supposed to like. <br /> <br />OK. Is Napoleon Dynamite a character we're supposed to like or relate to? If you've ever been in high school, which most of us have, we have seen a character like Napoleon Dynamite. He is absolutely clueless, is a \\"nerd\\" to the thousandth degree - but that's why we like him! If we're still in high school, then perhaps we would laugh at him and think it's not only funny, but appropriate, for him to be picked on and teased by his peers. However, most of us are out of high school, and most of us - if we have any sense of moral decency - regret that we ever made fun of or picked on anyone like Napoleon. To me, THAT is part of what this film is about. His \\"victory\\" at the end is not something to be mocked. It's more of a victory that would probably come years down the road - but that wasn't the nature of this film, so they showed us that victory in a somewhat shortened sense. <br /> <br />One of the most memorable lines in the film to me was Napoleon's comment that (and this may be paraphrased) \\"girls like guys who have skills\\". Was that not true in high school? Of course it was! I know many girls that I went to high school with that deeply regret the indifference they showed to people like Napoleon. I myself, while not being a \\"jock stud\\" feel awful when I think of the people that I completely neglected or poked fun at people like Napoleon. Heck, to some people, I was Napoleon. This was very gutsy and accurate portrayal of high school. <br /> <br />So what's wrong with a film where the \\"nerd\\" comes out on top? Absolutely nothing. <br /> <br />And what's wrong if we laugh along the way? The humor was so subtle, not side-splitting laughter, but it was there. And that was the essence of the film: subtlety. It wasn't going out of its way to make you laugh, to try and make you feel sorry for Napoleon - it was simply demonstrating a particular existence. And it was done remarkably well. And it gave you several laughs along the way. <br /> <br />All of the actors fit their roles perfectly - again with the same subtlety. If you want Adam Sandler, this isn't the film for you, and Ebert was really off base when he drew that comparison. <br />
B0002MG9SI|4.0|Colorful and magical, Amlie grabs your attention from the moment the first scene scrawls across the screen. This movie truly made me wonder why I make such an effort to be so adult at times. It is romantic, funny, quirky, and quite colorful. Though the storyline is quite unrealistic - Amlie has all the time in the world to tend to other people's problems while working at a diner where she probably isn't being paid much - that's pretty much the beauty of it. I love this movie
B0000029DD|5.0|All Muse, Coldplay and all other fans of pretender bands take note this is a real artist/genius at work, whilst all those other Buckley tribute acts try to copy or equal this albums brilliance, they never will, why? They ain't good or original enough, if only he'd done a follow up then his greatness would surely had been appreciated.   R.I.P Mr Jeff Buckley   THANK'S FOR GRACE
0312995423|5.0|A gripping thriller .. Becker chasing a mysterious ring through Seville , Spain .. Strathmore , Dep Director , NSA .. super patriotic - always the most dangerous kind !<br /><br />Ofcourse lovely susan could use some physcops training !!
B00003CXXP|5.0|Haley Joel Osment is amazing in this movie. I would say he is a child prodigy. His character is a robot who is programmed to unconditionally love his \\"parents\\".  Unfortunately his parents are creeped out by him and leave him in the woods to fend for himself. So this robot who has been programmed to love this couple has been abandoned and he's like a salmon swimming upstream - doesn't know what to do with himself. It's twisted. It's Kubrick's \\"2001 - A Space Odyssey\\" turned on it's head - the robot is the victim. The special effects are amazing - Manhattan under water, the animatronic bear. Towards the end you keep thinking the movie is about to end - yet there is another scene...but the last scene is heartrbreaking. It's a chilling Kubrick movie shown through the eyes of commercial boxoffice E.T. director Steven Spielberg. The ying and yang of both directors visions are brilliant. Only Spielberg could have gotten the budget for such an off-beat movie. It's kind a cross between Pinochio and Wizard of Oz - but dark. Haley Joel Osment gives an amazing nuanced performance. Just looking in Haley's eyes - he is able to convey intelligence and feelings far beyond someone his age. I highly recommend this dark fairytale.
B00076NYFU|3.0|Can not fault the music, definite 5 stars.  But, the overall sound of this \\"remaster\\"?  The  sound is very \\"treble heavy\\" & \\"harsh\\" sounding. I actually had to turn the treble EQ on my car stereo into the \\"negative\\" range.  However, it may be  the master tapes who are at fault here, so I'm not really laying blame.  The remainder of the remastering is flawless.  The guitars & vocals ring true with Lancaster's bass thumping away clearer than ever.  If you are reading this, you are no doubt a Status Quo fan debating on whether to drop some extra cash on this \\"remaster\\".  My advice?  You gotta have it, so get it; there is a big here improvement over the original import cd release.  If you can wait awhile, I'm sure zShops will even  see some at a much lower cost in a few months.<br />New update...turns out the master tapes left much to be desired on the high end. Still a huge improvement and upgrade  over the older releases.  (I would actually upgrade my review to 4 stars, but the system won't allow it.)  Plus you can find this on zShops now for  a real good price.  So what are you waiting for!
B000683VI4|5.0|How does one write a review for a movie that truly touches the very core of human existance?  In this gripping movie we meet two young people, Noah and Allie.  Noah, being a poor boy and Allie coming from a well-to-do family, meet and fall in love.<br /><br />However, this is a forbidden love and so we see them separated for a season, however as true love finds its way they find each other years later and being their life together.<br /><br />Soon the years pass and we find them now aged and Noah's love no longer remembers who he is as she is being ravished b Alzheimers.<br /><br />Both residing in a Nursing Home, Noah reads the story of their courtship, their love, in hopes that she will return to him.<br /><br />This movie made me smile and tore at my heart at the sametime.<br /><br />Perhaps as a woman I want to believe there truly is love like this, so deep that there is no obstacle that will stop it. A love that flowed through two people in such a joining that together they enter eternity.<br /><br />This movie was outstanding and I recommend it highly.
2070364232|5.0|Like most non-Fench people I was introduced to \\"Le Petit Nicolas\\" in my French class. It sounded strange for a bunch of adults to read a book that is for 9-12 year-old kids. But, alas, it is not strange. On the contrary! That is a great idea, for many reasons. To begin with, the text has an easy vocabulary and uses words that are used in the everyday language -- different to the highbrow literature that would be impossible to a debutant read.<br /><br />\\"Nicolas\\" is also great because it is funny. Even for those who aren't French, who don't understand French Culture, they can laugh with this boy and his peers. These characters somehow make we believe that being a child is the same everywhere.<br /><br />On a deeper level, \\"Le Petit Nicolas\\" can be an effective sociological portray of being a child in the early 60s in France. The garçon's life shows a middle-class family dealing with `problems' --ok, not very serious one, this a book for children, after all-- like not having a TV, or when the kid has low marks. But, everything is dealt with a funny approach.<br /><br />With his peculiar vision of the world --everything is seen through Nicolas' eyes-- and his `problems', this little boy shows to the grown-ups who delightful it can be to be a child. Even if we have forgotten that.
B00008URYM|4.0|This is the CD Single of Madonna's \\"American Life\\".  It features the [Radio Edit] of the song where the explicit lyrics are deleted. The track clocks in at 4:28, compared to the 4:57 album version.  As a bonus, \\"Die Another Day\\" [Calderone & Quayle Afterlife Mix] is included on this CD Single.  The 8:52 minute mix is not available on the \\"Die Another Day\\" CD Single, and as far as I know, is not to be found on any other CD than this one.  If anything, this track is worth the small price.  In addition to this CD Single, Madonna fans should also buy the \\"American Life\\" Rmxs MAXI Single.  It features 5 versions of \\"American Life\\", none of which are the [Radio Edit], as well as another bonus track \\"Die Another Day\\" [Richard Humpty Vission Electrofield Mix]! Keep building up your Madonna collections!
B000002LPD|4.0|I love Van Halen with or without David Lee Roth, I prefer him to Sammy and Gary but who doesnt? This is there best album with Sammy. The guitar playing on this recorded is the best Eddie ever played with Sammy, not since David did we hear such roaring solos and out of this world riffs. Michael and Alex's rythem remains the best in rock and Sammys voice is better then ever.<br /><br />The albums opens with its best song the powerful 'poundcake' this is one of Van Halens all time best songs. The production is cool as hell and its like a return to early Van Halen, I love it. 'Judgement Day' is high energey Van Halen at its best. 'Spanked' is very funky and has a really cool bass line. The guitar riff is really cool its one of Eddie's all time best. The only thing I didnt like about this song is that the drums sound like they are electric, which bothers the hell out of me. I love the next song 'Runaround' it was one of the biggest hits off of this album and its one of Van Halens best of all time. If you listen to the lyrics its about a teen trying to score with his girlfriend and the hell he has to go through to get it, its so awesome! Amazing guitar solo as well, and Sammy's vocals are top notch here. 'Pleasure Dome' is all right but nothing way to special. 'In n Out' is a cool up beat catchy song with a killer guitar riff, its really high pitched and out of this world! One of the better tracks on the album with out a doubt! 'Man On A Mission' is such an awesome song, I dont know what it is about this song but it is really cool, I love the drumming, Alex lays down a pretty sweet groove, and Sammys Vocals are near perfect on this one. 'Dream Is Over' has a really cool guitar riff as always and an awesome chorus, well the lyrics are pretty cool the whole way through its about a man going through a mid-life crisis, I think. Anyways I really like this song. The biigest hit off the album was 'Right Now' which you have heard about a half a million times and still love to this day. One of Van Halens best musicaly with that amazingly cool piano intro by Eddie and the killer guitar solo to Sammy Hagars signature vocals and actually pretty compelling lyrics for once, it makes this track Van Halen most unique. '316' is nothing special it doesnt really apeal to me. 'Top Of The World' is a pretty decent song I think it was a pretty big hit as well but it didnt really catch my ear, I was never a fan of it. I think if the album would have ended with 'Right Now' it would have been perfect.<br /><br />If you drop 316 you would have one of the best albums of all time. So if you are looking for a Van Halen record with out David Lee Roth then For Unlawful Carnel Knowledge is the way to go. Don't miss out!his day.

B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day, a band that never really impressed me anyway, has taken a sharp decline in my opinion.    The video to \\"american idiot\\" showing the flag of the USA in green, then bleeding, is blasphemous enough, but the lyrics are the real offense. Green Day is pandering to the elitist left-wing snobs in this country as well as England, and I've been thoroughly turned off by their whining. If they dislike the United States this much, then they can get the hell out.
0553106635|5.0|i dont have a lot of time so this is just a short review: this book surpassed any expectations i had for it. even after the first two books I wasn't expecting a literary masterpiece such as this one. the book is so intricate, fascinating and well written it makes you wonder how Harry Potter got to be so famous with books like this one just lying on the shelves. I don' care who disagrees with me, I felt these books were on the same level with LOTR, easily. Never predictable, always exciting, at times I put the book down and just wondered how George RR Martin put all this together. The book is quite dirty though, which means dont give this book to your 13 year old. If you know anyone who reads-at all-get them this book. 5 STARS!

0800141849|3.0|I have been a fan of Barbra Streisand's for as long as I can remember, from the first time she appeared on the Ed Sullivan show singing CRY ME A RIVER through all of her Columbia albums and many of her films.  Barbra the director and songwriter, Barbra the producer, and Barbra the star.  If any movie has been a vanity fair for Babs, THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES is it.  As in the classic FUNNY GIRL, Barbra plays a \\"plain\\" woman who can't believe any handsome man (Omar Sharif and now Jeff Bridges) could possibly find her attractive.  In all actuality, this is the kind of movie Barbra should have made when she was in her thirties; it seems kind of childish for a mature woman in her early fifties to be so concerned about whether or not she is beautiful.  Her makeover at the end is also all about Barbra's personal journey into the realms of looking like a movie star.  Including her infamous seventeen inch fingernails.  The movie overstays its welcome, too; it's a little too long to sustain a deep conviction to the film.  Barbra as always is a wonderful actress, but this role she's done too many times, and frankly I didn't truly believe in her as much as I did say in FUNNY GIRL or THE WAY WE WERE.  Jeff Bridges is a marvelous actor, but he overdoes it in this role, trying hard to match his superstar co-star but forgetting a more controlled performance would have been a better match.  Lauren Bacall who lost her supporting actress Oscar to Juliette Binoche (ENGLISH PATIENT) brings the movie her star presence, but it's a performance that could have been done by any actress and would have been just as effective.  Pierce Brosnan in a rather small role effuses his international charm in a poorly conceived role.  George Segal and Brenda Vaccarro are also wasted in brief appearances, although Segal who once starred with Babs in THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT makes a game effort.  Perhaps the best performance in the film belongs to Mimi Rogers, the ex Mrs. Tom Cruise, whose portrayal of Babs' hedonistic and unfulfilled sister gives the movie a certain dark edge.  Marvin Hamlisch's 1950ish sounding score is also out of place; even though the movie tries to be like one of those PILLOW TALK type of films, it's 1990s atmosphere and look make the score anachronistic.  It was nice hearing such great songs as TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS and YOU DON'T KNOW ME though.<br /><br />It's ironic that this was Barbra's last film until the recent MEET THE FOCKERS, in which she plays a mother, and not someone who's trying to convince everyone how lovely she is.  Hopefully if Barbra makes more movies (and she should--she is a superstar), she'll play on her comic and dramatic abilities and accept the fact that her fans think she's beautiful and we don't want to have to keep telling her so!!!!s' hedonistic and unfulfilled sister gives the movie a certain dark edge.

B0000004F9|3.0|The review from James Jacobs inspired me to check this one out. I expect the concert he saw was when Jimi Hendrix was tiring of trotting out the same old hits and tended to dash through his set without much inspiration. So The Soft Machine may have been more interesting in comparison that night, but upon listening to Vol.s 1 & 2, I hear nothing that can approach the genius of Jimi.<br /><br />The drummer is probably the best thing going for this disk. The music is jazzy and creative, but not as \\"out-there\\" as I've been lead to expect. Much of it sounds rather awkward to me and its sound is stuck very much in the sixties. I understand that VOLUME 3 is more open-ended and jazzy, so maybe I'd like that one better.<br /><br />I like \\"Volume 1\\" better than \\"Volume 2,\\" the later almost moving into Cabaret/Vaudeville musical territory that doesn't turn me on much. Still, this stuff is fairly unique and interesting. Obviously, I'm not nearly as crazy about it as most of the other reviewers here, but I'm coming at it from a backwards perspective, having never heard them until recently (I think this forum would be pretty useless if people only dumped excessive praise on their favorite music without any objectivity).<br /><br />A recommendation: for something off the beaten path kinda like Soft Machine but much cooler, groovier and way better (IMHO) check out SOUNDTRACKS, TAGO MAGO, EGE BAMYASI or FUTURE DAYS from the legendary CAN.
B000002OX3|2.0|there's one big drag here:  \\"a quick one\\" is the tepid studio version, not the terrific, rousing performance from the Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus film (you can find it on the \\"Rushmore\\" soundtrack--thank Wes Anderson for bringing that song back!).  the acoustic \\"happy jack\\" is pretty good.  the who are no the kinks.  get pete townsend's solo albums...
1591840562|5.0|I love it when things seem obvious right after you read them.  YOu feel like \\"yeah, I knew that,\\" but if in fact you did, you hadn't thought it nearly as well as this author says it.<br /><br />Kawasaki focuses very well on what's important and doesn't try to cover every detail. He includes a lot of the kind of thinking that resonates.  For example, a strikingly new idea on mission vs. mantra, an excellent summary of what's important about the business plan, and very good chapters on bootstrapping, pitching, raising capital, and positioning. He is serious about giving you the \\"gist\\" of each topic. He has a real gift for making simple sense out of complex realities.<br /><br />This is not a step-by-step guide to starting a dry cleaning business or a taco stand.  It's a lot deeper than that, and it skips a lot of pithy detail.<br /><br />It is however very strong on food for thought. It's full of good lists and useful (but extremely simple) exercises.<br /><br />It is also particularly strong on the start-up process for the more sophisticated start-ups that are looking for outside investors. The bootstrapping discussion is excellent, but much of the book slants towards the high-tech high-growth high-profile start-up.  Chapters on pitching the idea and raising capital are great for that higher level startup.<br /><br />However, you don't have to be thinking about starting a business to get a lot out of this book.  If you're running a business, growing a business, or running a department or group in a business, or even if you want to do that some day, then this is an excellent book.<br /><br />Read it for how it makes you think.  Read it for the new angles you'll get on core concepts.<br /><br />I've started several businesses and I've been involved with start-ups most of my career, which is 30+ years now. This is one of the first books I recommend.
0451526015|5.0|Imagine being beautiful and never growing old. Imagine not being able to be killed by nature or man. Any wounds, weathering or ravaging from age would instead be reflected in a picture of you in the attic...What would you do? Would you help people or would you become warped by your own perversions and desires? The picture captures these nuances as well. Every heart you break and every insult you make transforms the picture. What happens when you look upon the portrait? Will you be oblivious or delve into madness at the horror of who you are? This is the tale of Dorian Grey and is one that anyone who is even mildly introspective must read and consider deeply. Buy it new in the bookstore or find an old battered copy in the used shop -it's a masterpiece no matter how horrible or wonderful it may look on the outside...too bad the same cannot be said for the us...<br /><br />Relic113
0385510454|4.0|Good airplane reading, a solidly developed hide and seek novel a bit like taking Pelican Brief to a nice location in Europe. Grisham obviously enjoys the locations and shares them with the reader as part of the fun.  I won't tell you where location is because it reveals too much plot, but I want to revisit after reading this. I've read several Grisham books, this is a lot more like Pelican Brief than Painted House.
B00008ADPF|1.0|Alright Nickelback fans, please, Im begging you. Before you buy this album, before you give a four or five star review or before you automatically click the \\"no\\" button at the bottom of this review, do something for me. If you happen to have 2 cd players handy, listen to \\"Someday\\" and \\"How You Remind Me\\" at the same time. Beat for beat, line for line, they are the EXACT same song. These guys have absolutely no originality; from the start theyve been ripping off grunge bands such as Pearl Jam and Days Of The New. And now theyre just writing the same songs over and over to sell to the naive, impressionable people who buy this junk and dont realize that Nickelback are only in it for the money. Stop supporting this band and all of its sound alikes.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, ever. I listened to it for years and still play it occasionally. There is a lot going on here- betrayal, mystery, sex, honesty, peace, salvation, love. All set to interesting and dark beats.<br /><br />The first time I heard this album, I thought it was pretty weird-sounding, actually. (Same with Music for the Masses, which I actually used to make fun of at some point...) A few listens of both sure changed my mind! I just hadn't acclimated to that \\"Depeche sound\\"... but Gahan's voice is something else...
B000066HI4|5.0|Sorry, that was insipid. <br /> <br />Anyway, few albums this good and this affecting from the late 90's come to mind. Among them would be In the Aeroplane Over the Sea and The Soft Bulletin. Rarely is music such great background and foreground music at the same time. After hearing it a few times at a friend's house some time in 1999, I scoured at least 20 record stores in at least five cities to find a copy of this. I eventually just got it via Amazon. <br /> <br />If anything, I love how deceitful Will Oldham is. What would you expect an album with a title and a cover like those and songs named \\"Minor Place\\" \\"Black\\" and \\"Death to Everyone?\\" Actually, the lyrics are very hopeful and it's nice to hear about the subject matter from a mature adult rather than some shallow, nasal teenager who thinks he has something relevant to say. After the first listen, this album has sincerely killed you softly with its piano, bass, tap-drumming, lazily strummed guitar and Oldham's erie, human voice. It really leaves you feeling dead in a way that so many musicians, by contrast, try to do with distorted guitars, double bass drums and screaming. <br /> <br />Goddamn this is good rainy day music. As my taste in music matures, Loveless slips further and further down my favorites of the 90's list with this edging its way into the top 5. This is a must own for people who like humanly affecting music but hate emo.
B0000TB050|5.0|Man!  These guys just get BETTER with time!!  I know that this was filmed September 2001, but damn, Damn, DAMN! Saw it first time tonight (12FEB2005, a birthday gift), and I guarantee that \\"Slane\\" will remain in my DVD carriage for some time.  If you've been a fan since the beginning (like me), the evolution from \\"Red Rocks\\" through \\"Rattle and Hum\\" to this is amazing, and these guys are at the TOP of their game in this DVD.  If you are a U2 fan, BUY THIS!!  If you are not a fan, you will be after viewing this.  Better yet, buy \\"Red Rocks,\\" \\"Rattle and Hum,\\" and THIS one (\\"...Slane...\\"), and watch in chronological order...the evolution makes my hair stand on end!  And you won't be bored by watching or listening to 7 hours of U2.  I promise!
B000053VAF|5.0|People always told me I'd like this movie. As an extremely cynical person, they said it would totally work it's way into my mind. But, being so cynical, I doubted that. My main draw was that Alanis Morissette, of whom I'm a huge fan (it's not even funny) plays the Almighty. But I never really took the time to find this movie. So, it found me. <br /> <br />One day as I was looking for something to watch on TV. And sure enough, Dogma was on. I was about a half hour late, but I decided to just watch it. When it was over, I was stunned. I fell in love with the movie right then and there. It was on later that day and I watched it again. I was even more enthralled the second time around. I resolved that I HAD to get this movie. I'll tell you why. <br /> <br />Dogma takes a very interesting look at the world of religion. It gets very sarcastic and critical at times, which drew the ire of many groups over whether or not the movie was appropriate. Obviously they never took the time to see it, because instead of making religion out as evil, the film does everything it can to show the viewer how good religion truly is. Unlike other movies that are like this for the sake of just being controversial and provocative to get attention, this raises many good points about the church and about society in general. Some might call this film blasphemous. I call it genius. An instant classic. I admire the people who came together to make such an amazing thing. The chemistry is perfect, EVERYONE has impeccable acting, and the story is just plain excellent. The writing is first-rate. Even better in fact. I don't want to give away anything, so I'll leave it to you to see it for yourself. I hope you're as wowed as I am. I just bought it today, 3 weeks after first seeing it. I just finished watching it and it seems to get even better with repeated viewing. So even if you hate it at first, you'll learn to love it. I loved it from the get-go.
B000002J09|5.0|There is no instrumental virtuosity, no amazing concept, it is simply the COHESION of the band that makes the finest album of all time. Classy!
B0002X314C|3.0|I wasn't blown away like I thought I'd be.  I'd read other reviews and listened to friends rave about this album.  It is good, don't get me wrong, otherwise I wouldn't give it three stars.  What I really would like to give it is 3.5, but since that wasn't an option, I settled on three.  Most of the cuts are good, but I just didn't quite get the hype.  There's nothing that stands out about his voice for me.  I picked up this album along with Brian McKnight's and Anthony Hamilton's latest CDs and I like both theirs better than this one.  I think John Legend will have a long career, though.  He's gifted.  No doubt.
0385507755|5.0|James Frey has written a harrowing and intense account of his recovery from drug addiction. If you ever need to have a friend or loved one \\"scared straight,\\" this book should do it.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I don't know what Roger Ebert's problem is. This is a great movie. I don't agree with his assessment that this film is depressing, and the only people who would laugh at Napoleon are people who feel superior to him. I laughed because I think anyone who wasn't part of the \\"popular\\" crowd in high school can relate to Napoleon's efforts to make a place for himself in his school and get a girl, regardless of how cluelessly he goes about it. Most people who were a little different from their peers as a teenager can relate to Napoleon, Pedro and Deb and their crusade against the shallow popular kids who look down on them. I had a friend in high school who ran for a student council position using a crazy gimmick - it didn't work for him, but this movie made me remember that and laugh. The movie is basically plotless but unbelievably funny. A lot of the humor is \\"laugh at, not laugh with\\" but does that make it a bad film? No.   I think this compares a lot with \\"The Big Lebowski\\" (another incredibly funny movie) in that it's a picture about misfits and the lives they lead, and the ham-handed, screwball ways they go about accomplishing a goal. Just like Jeff Lebowski, Napoleon is unlikeable in a lot of ways, but the character is so earnest it's hard not to develop some kind of affection for him. I highly recommend that anyone - not just teenagers - see this movie. It's touching and funny in just the right way.  (p.s. Most of the people who are giving this movie 1-star reviews are either functionally illiterate or they use lots of really large, complicated words in their reviews so they can sound as pompous and elitist as possible. That should tell you what kind of people don't like this movie. Always consider the source, people! Enough said.)
B00000DGXN|5.0|It's incredible how these great musicians work beautifully together. I particulary like the playing of Pat Metheney and Gary Burton. After some repeated listening the whole coherent picture started to emerge.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This record deserves a solid two or three stars for the strength of tracks like \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien.\\"  However, to hurt its average score on the website, I figured a 1-star rating would be more appropriate.  Anyways, as for the review:    Radiohead fans possibly make up one of the most obnoxious majorities on the planet.  Ravenously scouring the internet for every mediocre B-side and unreleased live track, claiming that anyone who disagrees with their canonization of these self-important Brits simply \\"doesn't understand music\\" -- they make up the only thoroughly pop fanbase that has ever swallowed so much elitist propaganda.  Let's tear down all the facades here and now: as of the year 2005, the Radiohead fans are the John Mayer fans are the Incubus fans, and there is nothing \\"elite\\" about them.    Nevertheless, OK Computer still stands as Radiohead's defining moment.  You could even call it a \\"masterpiece\\" if such a term could ever be applied to a record with such a weak opening track and final stretch.  Importantly however, with a band that has been defined by severely hit-and-miss records ever since The Bends (their first recording to contain at least one good song), the title of defining moment applies to the record where the pieces fit most often.  OK Computer definitely has a respectable share of  triumphs: tracks 2 through 6 of this record are excellent achievements in modern \\"rock\\" music.  Unfortunately, OK Computer is not an album that works as a cohesive whole -- the atmosphere may be maintained until the end, but that does not mean that the record amounts to more than a fleeting adrenaline rush tapering into an overlong unimaginative lull.      Essentially, Radiohead is a singles album with no radio-ready material.  Its A-side is loaded with nothing but direct hits (minus the childish lyrics and uninspired composition of \\"Airbag\\"), while the B-side (starting with the fatally pretentious and momentum-wrecking \\"Fitter Happier\\") flounders in a ponderous stupor, jolting us out of our slumber only for the raucous mess of \\"Electioneering.\\"  Does it utterly demolish the musical artists that Radiohead fans love to stack it up against (Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, any manner of pop-culture schlock)?  Absolutely.  Does that mean it can hold a candle to the vast array of superior albums that were released before and since?  Hardly.    OK Computer surpasses the dumb U2 plundering that characterized Radiohead's previous material, and it is far better than the emotionally vacant experiments that followed it (including the absolutely abysmal hollowness of Hail to the Thief).  Unfortunately, it still holds true to the perplexing problem inherent in all Radiohead material: the lyrics are sophomoric, it isn't particularly intelligent, it is far from emotionally moving...in fact, it rarely moves beyond its admittedly clever gimmick of aurally representing the \\"isolation\\" of our era.  So why does everyone like it so much?  Do that many people in the world today feel so isolated by technology?  Or are we all just buying into the idea that weird music that sounds experimental but isn't too hard to listen to is musical genius?  Contrary to popular belief, this music is not \\"difficult\\" -- in fact, it shows its hand quite readily.  But apparently, generous use of strange electronic sounds and production effects in addition to cryptic lyrics is what it takes to be the greatest band of all time.    I would also like to play a game called \\"name one good band that has truly been influenced by Radiohead\\" (keeping in mind that Radiohead is simply a moodier, less anthemic U2 with a heavier electronic influence).  And no, Coldplay and Muse don't count.    Sorry, Radiohead fans, you can vote that my review wasn't \\"helpful\\" to you but that doesn't mean that these moaning Brits are anything more than a passing fad, and will never be placed in the canon of real musical achievements, nor will their middlingly inconsistentalbums.

B000002TQV|5.0|I just bought the bends yesterday at a used cd store and i just loved it.  the moment i put on planet telex, i was amazed by the originality of the album. <br /> <br />and this isnt crappy originality, its functional genius. <br /> <br />planet telex is an ideal first track, it sets the tone for the album, a sort of vibrant, mysterious, vague, yet strangely compelling. <br /> <br />the bends is as close to \\"normal\\" rock as this album gets.  it opens with guitar and then leads nicely into thom yorkes wailing vocals. <br /> <br />personal favorites are black star, nice dream, and street spirit. <br /> <br />this is one of the best albums i have bought in the last few years.  i knew it was special the moment i put it on my stereo.

B00005JNEI|1.0|I watched this movie a week ago.  I have nothing against listening to the other side, but why would I listen to Michael Moore when he lies, takes things out of context and virtually ignores the opinion of the other side.  Do people who really believe in what they're doing use cheap-onesided debating tactics such as this?   <br /> <br />I really wish that I put money into hearing another liberal speak who had enough passion about the subject to film fairly, listen to both sides ( without editing -  I guess I must add now) and a come to a rational conclusion.   <br /> <br />My post isn't meant to be anti-liberal, it's anti-MM.  During Roger & Me he interviewed people before the GM layoffs and fixed it so it looked like their lifestyle was a result of the GM layoffs.  Is this a man whos main concern is showing how the GM layoffs hurt people, or is this a man who's just trying to make a film that will stir emotions? <br /> <br />In F9/11 he asked a Senator a question about sending his son to war and he only filmed the question.... not the answer ( which, by the way, was \\"I don't have a son but my nephew is in Iraq\\").  Let me write that again, in a \\"documentary\\" he filmed himself asking a question, and DIDN'T FILM THE MANS ANSWER!!!!!!!!  Is this a man who is really interested in finding out whether gov't officials are above having their children in the armed forces, or is this a man who's just trying to stir emotion? <br /> <br />I have heard many fair and rational arguments from liberals, not one has come out of MM's mouth.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I have heard this album being compared to the Clash's \\"London Calling\\".  Whoever would do such a thing should be spanked.  I am so sick and bored of all mainstream music, mainstream tv, and just poeple in general.  This album is the epitmy of many years of MTV trying to shove their \\"punk\\" bands down my throat. Enough is enough, ya' know?  Too much of any thing is bad.  It's time to get some talented musicians some face time.  Maybe talent is a long gone fairy tale that will never happen again.  Some people are content to think that this is alright, and that we should just accept it.  Not me.  Real punk was a result of people being bored with the music industry and trying to change it, but it obviously didn't work.  It seems as if nothing can stop crappy poppy bands.  And this band isn't helping anything.
1932100385|5.0|The China Study is a courageous survey of the best science has to offer about your health and what you eat. In addition, the China Study reveals a system of nutrition misinformation that has created public confusion equal to that which surrounded the health implications of smoking.  Remember the days when \\"no one knew\\" that smoking was bad for you?  That all ended when a few morally courageous individuals spoke out and demanded examination of the topic.  We now know that the tobacco industry not only knew the health risks, they added ingredients to make their products more addictive.  The current state of nutrition information is just as convoluted - and the food industry is just as interested in keeping you confused and addicted to its products.  Dr. Campbell (writing with his son, Thomas) is the morally courageous voice in this field and he speaks the truth about what he has found, above the clamor of the objecting voices in \\"the establishment\\". <br /> <br />The book is organized into four parts.  The first part follows the compelling life story / research career of Dr. Campbell.  Campbell grew up on a dairy farm in Virginia and began his professional life trying to discover more efficient ways of raising cattle to deliver protein to our diets.  Through an accidental series of discoveries, he became interested in the relationship between high levels of protein consumption and cancer development.  He ended up with astonishing research that showed high levels of protein consumption to be a more potent promoter of cancer than high level exposures to Aflotoxin.  This startling evidence led him to organize \\"The China Study\\" (namesake for the book) - a uniquely comprehensive study of the relationship between diet and disease in 65 counties of rural China.  The study examined approximately 6,500 adults and looked at blood samples, urine samples, and food intake records (researchers went into homes to observe and collect this data), to document over 367 variables relatedto health status and diet.  This data was systematically compared with disease rates for 48 different diseases. <br />  <br />The second part of the book is a survey of professional scientific research from around the world, regarding the relationship between diet and a whole host of diseases.  Campbell focuses on a class of diseases - referred to as \\"diseases of affluence\\" - that are experienced at higher rates in developed countries than in developing countries.  This part of the book meticulously documents the relationship between various diets and the following diseases: heart disease, obesity, diabetes, common cancers (breast, prostate, large bowel), auto-immune diseases (including type I diabetes, MS), osteoporosis, kidney stones, macular degeneration, dementia and Alzheimer's.  This survey reveals that across this broad range of diseases, there is one diet that consistently prevents these diseases, and one diet that consistently promotes these diseases.  <br /> <br />The third part of the book is a brief nutritional guide.  It discusses eight principles of food and health, and gives advice on how to eat. In essence, these eight principles present Campbell's theory of nutrition - what is important to health and what is not.  Principle six, for example, says \\"the same nutrition that prevents disease in its early stages (before diagnosis) can also halt or reverse disease in its later stages (after diagnosis).\\"  The principles create a well-founded summary derived from the evidence presented earlier in the book. <br /> <br />The fourth and final part of the book answers the question \\"so why haven't I heard all this before?\\"  Campbell sits in a unique position to answer this question.  He has been involved in the relationship between nutritional scientific research and public health information at all levels.  As a university researcher, he built a career on publicly funded grant research, he sat on the approval boards for similar grant programs, and he experienced the politics involved.  As a well-respected expert in his field, he was called to testify before Congress on food safety, he sat on the panel that developed nutrition information labeling for packaged foods, and he has been on the National Academy of Science's expert panel on Diet, Nutrition and Cancer.  As a dedicated scientist, he helped found the American Institute for Cancer Research, and he is familiar with the policy and funding priorities of this and other cancer research groups.  From this unique position, Campbell reveals a public health information system that is biased.  Although he is deliberate to state that he does not see a back room conspiracy here, he is conclusive in arguing that our system is corrupted and unreliable.  <br /> <br />The fourth section, combined with the strength of the scientific evidence presented in this book, strongly establishes that this book should have an appeal that is MUCH broader than the alternative crowd, the \\"vegan\\" crowd, or the \\"health nut\\" crowd.  This is more than a diet book, more than a book for people who are already suffering from disease and looking for help, and more than a fringe perspective.  This is a book that demands attention, demands answers and should be given not only deep thought but also wide publicity.  Who will answer for this system of corruption, and how will we get them to do it?  Ignoring the information in this book would be as grave as ignoring the first courageous individuals that presented reliable evidence against the tobacco industry. Read this book, share it with someone you love, and call your Congressman to demand action.  This book should change lives.  Though it sounds an alarm, it also pronounces that we have strong hope - a simple, proven and economically efficient means to prevent and treat a host of diseases and to create long, vibrantly healthy lives.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This was my weekend for non-linear movies, as I saw both this film and \\"The Grudge\\" on DVD.  The latter film was pretty good, but \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" really stood out for me.  It had the usual Charlie Kaufman cleverless (actually, this is probably his MOST clever screenplay to date), but that trademark cleverness was- more so than ever before- acting in the service of some very human, emotional themes.  By the way, a concise little 11-minute \\"making of\\"/cast & crew interview piece (one of the DVD extras) nicely sums up those themes for those who don't easily get their arms around offbeat, non-linear fare like this.  But honestly, the movie isn't all that hard to follow and understand, so don't let it scare you off.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Ever since Nimrod, Green Day have been losing it. <br />While Nimrod had some good original sounding fast rock songs, it also contained the horribly popular \\"Good Riddance\\" and alot of trumpets and harmonicas on it. <br />The middle part of the record was good. <br />As for the next album Warning well that was pretty bland. <br />And it sounded way to poppy and way too popular amoungst \\"popular music\\" oviously. <br /> <br />Although musically both thoses albums were good, Green Day have made this time (and after 4 years of waiting!!) the most boringest typically lame and stupid album that they could of made. <br />This without a doubt the worst and most uninteresting record, and they never quite blew it untl this. <br />At least \\"Warning\\" and \\"Nimrod\\" had something to offer musically, but this is just commercialised rubbish. <br /> <br />And they're touring with Simple Plan, another wastefull disgusting and dreadful band. <br /> <br />That says it all.
0385504209|5.0|For a while I resisted reading this book, thinking that it could not possibly be as good as its hype. Well, I was wrong. This is simply one terrific book that will keep the reader riveted to its pages until the very last one is turned. It is a very well-written, intricately plotted thriller in which a great number of esoteric historical facts and interesting theories of a religious nature are woven. Those who read it should, first and foremost, keep in mind that this book is simply a work of fiction.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose when Jacques Sauniere, the  elderly and revered curator of the Louvre, is murdered inside the museum. The crime scene and the body itself are laden with symbols and cryptic messages pointing to renowned Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon. He is invited to the crime scene by the wily Captain Bezu Fache, of the Central Directorate Judicial Police, the French equivalent of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, ostensibly to assist the police. Little does Langdon know that he is, in fact,  the prime suspect.<br /><br />When he meets police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, they join forces. They are then led on a merry chase by a series of riddles and ciphers that are ground in a historical context. They are always just one step of the French police, who seem determined to charge Langdon with the murder of Jacques Sauniere.  During their voyage of discovery, Langdon and Sophie come across a secret society, the Priory of Sion, that has  a startling list of former members, which list includes Leonardo Da Vinci, as well as the late Jacques Sauniere. There is also  some interesting historical detail about the ancient Knights Templar, as well as Opus Dei, a conservative religious organization currently in existence.<br /><br />Langdon and Sophie peel back layers of historical clues that point to a secret of such magnitude that some would kill for it.  As Langdon and Sophie surreptitiously travel from France to England and seem to be headed closer to the heart of the mystery that  they are trying to unravel, an  unknown nemesis is closer to them than they would dare imagine. This unknown adversary is marshaling resources in order to obtain  the long hidden secret that Langdon and Sophie appear to be on the brink of discovering. It is one that has the potential to have earth shattering implications.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, plot driven, rather than character driven, thriller. It hurls itself into the reader's consciousness at break-neck speed, and before the reader realizes it, the book holds the reader in its thrall: hook, line, and sinker. For those readers who love historical detail and unusual facts and coincidences, this is definitely a fascinating book that will hold their interest. It is a page-turning thriller in which nearly every chapter leaves the reader on the brink of a precipice. The book is written in clear, effortless prose, which makes the most esoteric historical details surprisingly easy to understand. Simple in its presentation but intricate in its plotting, it is no surprise that this book has become a runaway, international bestseller.

B000777J2S|1.0|I am sorry. I usually do not enter my opinion, but I do feel this album has compelled me into a short rant. I love Rufus (Wainwright)so much and love every one of his songs( well almost, read on...)I own every album and my hard drive is filled with unreleased bootlegs and live performances, but you know what? When I heard the last track on his CD \\"Want Two\\", I could not believe that there was actually a Rufus song I could'nt stand...The reason? I could not bare to hear \\"Antony\\" \\"sing\\". See, Antony does guest vocals on the track, and he killed any chance of me enjoying the song. I like to think of myself as a humble and well rounded musician, but how this guy can be so adored boggles my mind. Sorry, but I just don't get it.
B00009ATIX|5.0|The movie Solaris based on the book is not a great movie but it is brilliant for the questions it raises when one stops to consider the implications. What is Solaris trying to communicate to us? Is it just trying to please us, toy with us or is it trying to teach us something? Each is searching for the truth as a scientist and a human being. One of the themes portrayed in this story is the search for truth. The two main methods of searching for it are outwardly through science and inwardly through inner enquiry. Further more each character in the story is forced to face a conflict within themselves and with each other about what is real and what is not.<br /><br />Let's start with the question, \\"What is love?\\" Kelvin is in love with Rheya (again) but not the real Rheya... Rheya is in every detail exactly taken from Kelvin's memory. Although he knows that she is not the same person the love he feels for her is real because it is based on a real person in his past.<br /><br />First let's look at the differences between he two Rheya's. We know that physically there are two Rheya's, we know one is real from earth and one is 'real' as in recreated living functioning human (but not the same person) in Solaris. We also could suggest that there may also be at some point behavioural differences between the two Rheya's. The Solaris Rheya's is programmed by Kelvin's memory and the Earth Rheya is not allowing the Earth Rheya more freedom of choice of behaviour.<br /><br />Now let's explore Rheya from Kelvin's point of view. Kelvin is plagued by the fact that Rheya on the space station is not real. He knows she is not the same women. The Rheya on earth was real, the Solaris Rheya is just a copy based on his memory (his stored perception of her). At this point begin to realise that there is actually no difference, from Kelvin's point of view, between the Earth Rheya and the Solaris Rheya. The Rheya on earth was never anything more than Kelvin's perception of her.<br /><br />Going further we realise that this is actually exactly how it works for all of us in our relationships on earth. So we ask ourselves, \\"What is love?\\" and we realise that our love is actually based not on the real person but on our perception of that person. Our feelings for another person are based on an inner relationship between ourselves and the mental image we have created of that person in our minds. This mental image is constantly updated by our perception of that person. Our perception is individual and biased, modified by our life's experience and many other factors. None of this is reality; none of this is truth and can never be argued as truth. However there is no other way to experience the world. We live in this fantasy, we have no choice. The only thing we can choose is be aware (in thought and action) that we live in a fantasy (a mental representation that is different from physical reality) or we can pretend that our fantasy it is real.<br /><br />Let's not stop there; we can go further, if it is like this with Kelvin (Subject) and Rheya (object) in relationship then is it true for all subject object relationships? Between Kelvin and everything he perceives? We know that there is a physical reality, that there is an ultimate truth but we also know that it is impossible to reach using our same object subject based experience of reality. So the question remains what is left. \\"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?\\" - Arthur Conan Doyle<br /><br />The story reveals that in essence the scientist and the spiritual human are the same... both seekers of the truth albeit with different approaches. The scientist searches for the Truth externally through subject object observation of the world. He seeks a way to study the world without his bias of perception so he devises methods to do this validation 'mental concepts' using instruments, methodology and peer review.<br /><br/>A spiritual human searches for the Truth internally. His search begins realising (consciously or unconsciously) that he is living in his own fantasy (a mentally constructed world). Deciding it is impossible to move beyond subject object relationships by looking externally he seeks internally. He seeks to examine the cause of this and then to see if he can move beyond it. He seeks to wake from this fantasy but finds nothing but his own seeking. It may take him a long time to realise that the answer is obvious. He thinks he has found nothing but he has found the looking. So this is where he turns his attention.<br /><br />The subject object mind creates separation between the two. Separation will always cause an indirect experience and thus no experience or understanding of truth (reality). In order to experience the truth (reality) there can be no separation from it. He decides to turn his attention away from examining objects (the observed) towards examining the subject (the observer; his awareness; his consciousness). Who is looking? Who is being aware? Is it possible to exist in a state of awareness without object? Is that reality (truth)? Solaris raises the possibility that in order to understand the universe we must first understand ourselves.<br /><br />\\"Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.\\" - C. G.

B000006TRV|5.0|In retrospect, the pain and suffering exerted into the making of The Wall comes through in its sheer weight and sonic thrust. Conceived as a multimedia experience for the stage as well as the silver screen, The Wall alludes to Waters' own personal nightmare -- of losing his father in the war, becoming a rock star, and being worshipped like a fascist demigod. The protagonist carries the burden of Waters' plight (and to a lesser degree, Syd Barrett's descent into madness) and is finally put on trial for building a wall between him and the rest of the world. That's the simplest way to describe it.     At the core is a surly collection of songs. Waters bears the lion's share as he unravels the plot from the very first note. \\"In The Flesh?\\" is an unsettling preamble that forcibly pulls you to the edge of your seat. Once the mood simmers for a spell in the eloquence of \\"The Thin Ice,\\" the disc becomes almost conciliatory with the disco inferno of \\"Another Brick In The Wall (Part Two).\\" As Floyd's first legitimate single in years, \\"Another Brick\\" baulks in the end by instigating the somewhat subversive lyrics to be sung almost in jest by an impromptu choir of school children. \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" its origins stemming from a David Gilmour chord progression, starkly points out the contrasts that lie between Gilmour's melodic sense and Waters' gloomy, yet intoxicating words. Once \\"The Trial\\" gets underway -- waging Waters' [...]

I hope the Stephanie/Ranger relationship continues.  Okay, so this isn't great literature but it is a fun read and I thoroughly enjoy this series. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I do agree that it is degenerating into silly and Stephanie is becoming somewhat incompetent, which is a disappointment.
B0006399FS|1.0|\\"don't let these people stop you form enjoying U2's new CD. Maybe they have nothing better to do than write long reviews to diss the CD\\"...  <br /> <br />Just take a look at the first reviews, the longest ones were 5 stars ones courtesy of U2's marketing team. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"I'm not embarassed to be a U2 fan. None of us, are\\"... <br /> <br />So you better talk for yourself. Just go to any other reviews site, and you'll realise fans are so dissapointed by this vanilla corporate use of the name \\"U2\\" on this rotten iPod product. Not enough ? just read 'An Open Letter To U2' before to write your childish post. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"And U2 fans love them no matter how stupid Bono acts sometimes\\"... <br /> <br />How old are you ? 13 ? maybe 15 ? surely silly teenagers will love any s**t named as \\"U2\\", as you do. Most of long-time fan base really hate both this awful All That You Can't Leave Behind re-issue and all that propaganda machine, leaded by iPod, Grammy, Rolling Stone, Time, NME, [...] etc, etc. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"By the way, U2 is 3 for 3 on Grammy noms\\"... <br /> <br />Everybody's know U2 will win at least 6 Grammys for any crap they release, because they're \\"U2\\". Not surprises, they can buy the whole event, sureley they already did it. I bet you they'll win \\"Album of The Year\\" at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006. Plus they'll win another 2-3 Grammys for things like \\"Best Rock Performance\\", \\"Best music video\\", \\"Best this\\", \\"Best that\\", etc, etc.  <br /> <br />U2 have shown with money you can buy everything, that's include YOU, my poor friend. <br /> <br />PS: By the way, I've been U2 fan since 1981. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0316172324|2.0|I would agree with several other reviewers of this book.  After a while, the book becomes very repetitive and states the obvious.  Yes, we clearly all make snap decisions and no, most of us don't analyze why we like jam for 15 minutes.  In the beginning, its alluring to read about John Gottman's experiments and how he can predict whether a couple will divorce or stay together.   <br /> <br />He goes on from there to indicate the process of reading emotive expressions, but never ties back to how we should interpret/digest his examples.  There seems to be lacking a definitive message in the book, suggestion, and practicality of whether we should go with intuition vs logic.  He points out that male/female attraction is often inexplicable, contains the X factor and is not grounded in logic of what we \\"say\\" we want in a person.  He never goes on to address how much weight we should give the X factor....have our minds become so highly tuned that it has integrated our deepest linear/logical thoughts as well as our non-linear feeling based wants/desires/needs and hence provides us with the X factor, or do we really need to discount the X factor to phermones and go back to what we logically want?   <br /> <br />How do we cognitively change unconscious emotions that in a blink of an eye, are expressed on our faces that as he points out, lead to either desirable or undesirable outcomes, and how much do we really need to change/hone this?  Where's the point of the book?

B000696PWC|5.0|Even though many in the US only know her as that cute diva who came out of nowhere with a pair of hit singles in 2002, Kylie Minogue has in fact been on an exceptionally long path ablaze with creative twists and turns. The newly released \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" serves as an ideal retrospective that summarizes nearly two decades of the Aussie singer's melt-in-your-mouth pop confections. Twenty-seven of the set's thirty-three tracks reached the Top 10 in the UK.<br /><br />The first disc, which contains recordings from the late 80's and early 90's, kicks off with the frantic \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" from her 1990 album \\"Rhythm of Love.\\" A fast-paced track with strong vocals and an undeniable hook, it epitomizes the pop sensibility and the lovable plonkety-plonk production of the era that satiates the first half of the collection.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing things about these songs is that, although her remake of Little Eva's 1962 hit \\"The Loco-Motion\\" was her only runaway hit in the US in 1988 before she disappeared from stateside radar for a decade and a half, it is the least enduring track on the first disc. This thus proves the worth of songwriting team Stock, Aitken and Waterman. who penned the great majority of her early string of hits while reportedly controlling her image and sound with a resented iron first.<br /><br />As a result, selections such as the urgent \\"I Should Be So Lucky, \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" and \\"Got Be Certain\\" are pure listening pleasure. Her cover of Chairman of the Board's \\"Give Me Just a Little More Time\\" from her 1991 album \\"Let's Get to It\\" is also surprisingly soulful, although her rendition of Kool and the Gang's \\"Celebration\\" which rounds out the disc sounds like it belongs on a tape to play in the car for your toddler.<br /><br />The onset of the second disc flips us into present-day Kylie with her new single \\"I Believe In You,\\" an entrancing slice of pulsating pop perfection she wrote with the Scissors Sisters that manages to pay homage to musical years gone by while still sounding fresh and original. Another new recording, \\"Giving You Up,\\" is included, along with selections dating back a decade.<br /><br />The sexy \\"Confide In Me\\" from 1994's self-titled CD finds Kylie cooing her lines to great success, while the introspectiveness of \\"Did It Again\\" and \\"Breathe\\" from her critically-acclaimed 1997 album \\"Impossible Princess\\" add ballast to the disc and prove that the pop starlet can indeed write substantial lyrics when she looks deep within.<br /><br />Selections from her 2000 album \\"Light Years\\" also add sizzle to the fire. \\"Spinning Around,\\" lucrative songwriter Kari Dioguardi's first hit, established Kylie as a dancefloor maven to outstanding success, as did the anthemic \\"On a Night Like This.\\" These tracks clearly set the stage for tracks like \\"Love at First Sight\\" and \\"Come Into My World\\" from 2002's \\"Fever.\\" The latter track is included here in its far superior radio version that won her a Grammy last year for Best Dance Recording.<br /><br />\\"Kids,\\" a left-field rock record with Robbie Williams and the bittersweet \\"Please Stay,\\" propelled by Spanish guitars and bubbly production, suggest that \\"Light Years\\" was a project that the US should not have missed out on. Furthermore, the ever catchy \\"Slow\\" and the radio version of \\"Chocolate\\" from 2004's extremely underrated \\"Body Language\\" album throw further entertainment into the mix.<br /><br />The disc closes with \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow,\\" her morbid mid-nineties collaboration with Aussie rocker Nick Cave that concludes with his murdering her that still continues to raise eyebrows.<br /><br />Although the capricious nature of the US music industry has caused Kylie Minogue to have a puddle of success in comparison to the rainstorm she continues to properly receive overseas, the reason for it has nothing to do with the quality of her music. \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" proves that repeatedly with its smorgasbord of solid tunes. If you have ever been even slightly interested in any of her music before but have never shelled out any of your hard-earned dollars, this is the definitive place to begin.olid tunes. If you have ever been even slightly interested in any of her music before but have never shelled out any of your hard-earned dollars, this is the definitive place to begin.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|Hitch(Will Smith) helps guys that have trouble with women, He helps them get their footing, and ask out the women by helping them do what they like. He also does this because he was rejected by a woman in college, and doesn't want to see that happen to them. He helps out a poor slob win over a rich heiress, and in the process, falls in love with a tabloid reporter. Then it all comes down on him, the tabolid reporter that he thought loved him sells him out and thinks that he is simply a \\"date hunter\\", that he hunts women for men to date.<br /><br />Will Smith was good in this, He was right for the part, and He had the feel for the character. I liked the way Eva Medes took her character and interacted with Will Smith. Kevin James makes a impressive first outing with movies, he is the most funny in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is. somehow, I felt the script was weak, I felt that some moments were forced, and some of the Humor was so fast that you didn't have time to think about the joke. I also felt that Will Smith was a little too confident in his role, and that he felt that he WAS the character, when I think that he could've taken situations and used his humor to make it funnier.<br /><br />The movie wasn't a masterpiece, I felt it was WAY better than some movies that have been released that call themselves \\"Romantic Comedies\\". I also felt that the Director was doing a good job but.... He could've gotten better performances by everybody. The writers needed to write something original, and instead of the cliches', they could've actually formed a decent romantic movie. I am not saying I didn't like it, I felt it was a very good movie but it has its flaws.
B0002VYQ2U|5.0|\\"Feels Like Home,\\" Norah Jones' follow-up to her Grammy-guzzling 2002 debut \\"Come Away With Me,\\" should please fans and win her new ones.<br /><br />The disc is similar to its predecessor, but it also takes notable strides in other directions. If you found yourself dozing off to Jones' music in the past, there's a far less chance of doing it here, as the new album is less dreamy and languid.<br /><br />The first evidence that Jones and her band are turning things up a notch is the urgent \\"What Am I To You?\\" -- a Jones original that features electric guitar. A more subdued version of the song appeared on certain Asian versions of \\"Come Away With Me.\\"<br /><br />The disc's tempo picks up far more with \\"In the Morning,\\" a catchy contribution from band member Adam Levy. Later, we get to the happy-go-lucky \\"Creepin In,\\" which features an excellent guest appearance by Dolly Parton. This is a fun track, and it's easy to imagine the two artists dancing arm in arm down a country road.<br /><br />The disc also contains a handful of tracks that would have fit splendidly with the more uniform \\"Come Away With Me.\\" One such tune is the melodic \\"Those Sweet Words,\\" which is a perfect showcase for Jones' vocal talent. The priceless \\"Carnival Town\\" drips with as much sugar and charm as \\"Sunrise,\\" with its laid-back arrangements and ethereal harmony.<br /><br />\\"The Prettiest Thing\\" will relax you with its warmth and simplicity, and \\"Don't Miss You at All,\\" which finds Jones writing her own lyrics to Duke Ellington's \\"Melancholia,\\" makes a perfect closer to the album.<br /><br />What the listener gets with \\"Feels Like Home\\" is pure musical excellence. The hype of Jones and her \\"Handsome Band\\" of skilled musicians is justified all the more with this release.<br /><br />To top that off, the live performances in Madrid of \\"In the Morning\\" and \\"Long Way Home\\" are absolutely superb, as the pair have proven time and time again in concert performances to translate particularly well live. \\"Creepin' In\\" is also excellent, and the music videos for \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"What Am I To You?\\" are as enjoyable to watch as the interview (of a very charming, self-conscious Jones) that rounds out the bonus DVD is informative.<br /><br />Furthermore, while \\"Sleepless Nights\\" and \\"I Turned Your Picture To the Wall,\\" a track penned by Levy's late grandfather, are two bonafide gems to add to the \\"Feels Like Home\\" CD, \\"Moon Song\\" is by far the superior of the trio. Invoking a sense of a picturesque landscape eclipsed by nightfall the powerful fluorescence of the moon, this track epitomizes what makes Jones and the Handsome Band such a special group of musicians.<br /><br />Whether or not you loved \\"Come Away With Me,\\" there's something for everyone here.well live. \\"Creepin' In\\" is also excellent, and the music videos for \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"What Am I To You?\\" are as enjoyable to watch as the interview (of a very charming, self-conscious Jones) that rounds out the bonus DVD is informative. <br /> <br />Furthermore, while \\"Sleepless Nights\\" and \\"I Turned Your Picture To the Wall,\\" a track penned by Levy's late grandfather, are two bonafide gems to add to the \\"Feels Like Home\\" CD, \\"Moon Song\\" is by far the superior of the trio.

B000683VI4|5.0|this story is wonderful, the book and now the DVD! When I first saw the notebook was in the cima and I fell in love with it, it is one of thows storys that makes you happy and thinking about it all night. a wonderful story for anyone who has ever falling in love!
B000002H6C|4.0|I was but a pimply faced, starting to grow my hair long and rock out 12 yr old in '88, approx 7th grade. I remember when \\"Justice\\" came out, perhaps because of my age or my peer group, I wasn't quite the \\"Metallihead\\" just yet. I can safely say early '88 is when i TRULY got into metal, for anything prior to winter '88 was Def Leppard, Whitesnake, crap in other words! I got into Metallica between \\"Garage Days\\", which was covers of course and \\"Justice,\\" so the new album was to be my introduction to their world. Well, 18 years later this is still an amazing album. 1988 was the REAL turning point for Metallica not 91's \\"Black Album\\" as many claim. 1988 was the FIRST venture into new material sans Cliff, their first video, and best mind you, for their apocalyptic masterpiece \\"One\\" and just about put Metallica on the cusp of superstardom. Many fans cried SELLOUT at the video for \\"One\\" but because i was new to Metallica and loving it...who was i to claim they were selling out? Naw, that was just the next step for the most brillant band of that era. no kiddies, their next album saw the REAL sellout and the unfortunate( sad but true anyone? ) but eventual fall from grace for the boys. they just got worse and worse and more ego centric from '91 to the present...sheesh just go see \\"Some Kind of Monster!\\" but in 1988 \\"And Justice for All\\" was it for me and about million other Metallica fans. They defintely sound more \\"poloished\\" than from previous efforts, production stunk but their sound was evolving into more diverse territory...rock, blues and even SYMPHONIES all worked their way into the sound. Every Metallifuk was at their peak musically, just listen to ulrich's furious double bass drumm and energy...who else could pound skins like this in '88? The songs didn't get me at first, after all 9 plus minute songs?? coming from the dudes that said \\"Metal up you you know what??\\" The title track \\"And Justic for all\\" grew and grew on me, as did most of the progressive songs such as\\"Harvester\\" and \\"Frayed Ends.\\" \\"One\\" was and is amazing from first listen, not cuz it was their first single/video, just cuz it is! I didn't care that the fellas once proclaimed \\"Duuuuude we'll never make a video,\\" everything they did at that particular time was METAL and they became my FAVORITE band on the planet!! Shortly after Sep '88 when \\"Justice\\" hit the stands, i quickly went out to get the Metalli-catalog. Yes \\"Master of Puppets\\" is their best album and will always remain so, \\"Lightning\\" is their speed devil masterpiece and \\"Kill em All\\" was great because it introduced us to Metallica, at such an \\"innocent\\"( for lack of better word ) time in the bands long, tumultuous history. I say this is 4 and a half stars, not 5, the production as most people will agree...just sux! Although, i would rather have Fleming Rasmussen at the boards ANY DAY over Bob Rock. Fer chrissakes did't this guy produce Journey or Foriegner albums or sum such crap, prior to becoming Metallica's fifth member? Once he did production on \\"Black\\" they would never sound the same! Who cars is if it's a crisp, clean million dollar budget sound? \\"And Justice for all\\" was truly the last of the great Metallica. Needless to say, as 1991 moved on and Metallica became what they are tofday, i pretty much buried their albums under what i was listening to in the early 90's( choose a band hahaha ) but when i pop on this bad boy 1988 is happening all over again...for better for worse!The ONLY good move Metallica has made in like, what 15-16 years? is bringing bass maestro ROB TRUJILLO on board. this guy is truly a monster on the bass, he keeps the spirit of Cliff alive while adding his own flava and YES he blows JAson out of the water. BUT...1 humble n amazing musician will DOUBTLY save a stuck in the past guitarist and 2 inflated egos...I will bite my words if they do something spectacular on wax but seeing as what they've spit out since '91? Hmmmmmm I won't hold my breath...hey James n Lars METAL UP YERA** DUDES!!!      <br />       <br />
B00008HCCF|2.0|Norah Jones has the most profound voice in music (I will NOT call it Jazz after hearing this DVD) since Joe Cocker (just saw his Woodstock performance-awesome) and Josh Grohban. <br /> <br />In this DVD, and I'm echoing many of the other reviews, there were so many problems with the quality of the sound. Yeah, her voice was STILL powerful and smooth, but the listener could not here the band and much of the richness of the songs were completely lost. The drums yes, sounded like congos, simply awful! This is one reason I don't call it Jazz as this drummer should have been using brushes. The use of drumsticks reek of 'pop' music. Additionally, the songs were over almost as soon as they started with little to no improvisation. That is not Jazz, either. <br /> <br />The Video showed her to upclose (the glitter on her face or whatever was not pretty and her nervousness was obvious. There were so many things wrong that the DVD did a disservice to her voice. <br /> <br />I got this DVD to compare to Diana Kralls two DVD's (Live in Paris and Live at the Montreal Jazz festival). These were TOP QUALITY productions and her backing musicians, well, are probably the BEST (John Clayton-Bass; Anthony Wilson; electric and Jeff Hamilton; drums) in the world.  <br /> <br />Norah Jones' voice, however, is one of a kind and she should settle for nothing less than Diana Krall's backing musicians. I would love to see Norah singing along with Diana's group (plus Diana). This would serve Norah and us better.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I enjoyed her debut album Songs in A Minor but I fell in love with this album after listening to it the first time. <br /> <br />The production is solid, the songs are well written and Alicia has never sounded better vocally. The intro, Harlem's Nocturne doesn't prepare the listener for what he/she hears next. The first two songs Karma and Heartburn are funky and upbeat and yet remain true to Alicia's love for 70's soul. <br /> <br />You Don't Know My Name, If I Ain't Got You (the best song) and Diary are great, heartfelt ballads with a real soulful feel. <br /> <br />My second favourite song is When You Really Love Someone. Next time you listen to it, listen closely to the words and feeling the song evokes. Truly touching and emotional. <br /> <br />I don't know if Alicia can top the success of this album. This is solid from start to finish and I can never get enough of it. It has been in my CD magazine since I bought it and I have no plans of shelving it anytime soon. Get out there and buy it if you haven't already...
B00022M518|4.0|Creative tension is good, but more than one leader in a band never works for long and after two groundbreaking albums with Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry and Eno parted company. After a couple of singles (which would have made nice bonus tracks), Eno recorded his dazzling solo album in September 1973. Bowie-esque in places, primal or avant-garde in others, it includes Baby's On Fire, the first song he ever wrote, and Cindy Tells Me, with its Roxy-like lines about Hotpoints left to rust in kitchenettes. There is considerable camp humour, too, as when he exclaims, \\"oh, cheeky cheeky, oh, naughty sneaky\\" (Dead Finks Don't Talk).<br /><br />Some have said that since the rest of Roxy Music (apart from Ferry) were employed as session men, the album gives a glimpse of what Roxy Music would have sounded like had Eno won the ego wars. I don't think this is true though, partly because the methodology is different when recording a solo album, and secondly because no more than a couple of members from the group play on any one track. Phil Manzanera adds distinctive guitar to 3 tracks, but Robert Fripp, Paul Rudolph and Chris Spedding contribute to the rest. All the sound is treated by Eno in his inimitable way. With hindsight, the multi-layered instrumental sections with their gamelan interludes and subtly-changing atmospherics can be seen as early indications of the paths he was to follow, though none of that was apparent at the time.<br /><br />For those who have speculated here about the title Here Come The Warm Jets, I would suggest a close scrutiny of the Eight Of Spades Victorian playing card depicted in the middle of the bottom shelf on the album cover.
B00005A8GY|5.0|Ok, ok... Lets get some things straight.  This is a standard Stereo SACD.  If you were expecting multichannel then it's your fault for not reading the info about it.  There are many of us who prefer 2 speakers over 5.1 or even 7.1 surround.  We were born with 2 ears right... not 7.1 (lol)  This matter does not suprise me because its still the case that most people think cds are more valuable than vinyl for sound.  Most of us cant spend the money on expensive vinyl equipment but thats another case and still the vinyl itself will always carry more information than a little cd format could ever.  It's not anyones fault that people buy cheap stereo equipment and expect nothing less than an inprovement with the sacds.  A salute to two channel audio lovers out there.  sorry... but 2 channel will always exist... nor will it ever depart these lands.
B00062IVKS|5.0|All I really have to ask is, \\"Why did it take so long for them to make a special edition for Raging Bull?\\" <br />Raging Bull is an American classic film that portrays the rise and self destruction of boxer Jake LaMotta (played by Robert Dinero).  Raging Bull is, in my opinion, regarded as great because it is tragic.  Most films of this sort will give you a happy ending where everyone is getting along in the end.  Raging bull, however, presents a more raw view of what can really happen.  Martin Scorsese does not shy away from showing us the violent and not so happy life that Jake LaMotta lead.  Also, Scorsese does a great job with the boxing scenes.  If you watch the shot-by-shot extra, you will see the extreme lengths that were taken for accuracy. <br /> <br />As for the extras, they are very good.  The disc two features are all worth watching.  The commentaries on disc one are pretty well done, but I was really hoping for one with Robert Dinero and Joe Pesci.  Despite this, Raging Bull is well worth your money.  Any movie fan must add this to their repertoire of DVDs.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I am lost. I never knew there could ever be a cd as...Puzzling as this cd. Formed from the ashes of the semi-popular band At The Drive-In, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala have created the industry crusher of music alltogether. Because of this cd, there are much higher standards for bands today. The sad thing is this band may never reach out to the masses. De-Loused in the Comatorium is a journey through the suicide of a friend dubbed as \\"Cerpin Taxt.\\" Right off the bat, this cd is powering. The intro song \\"Son Et Lumiere\\", leading into \\"Inertiatic ESP\\" is a song all by itself. Missing that song is like missing the first 2 chapters of a book, or the first 20 minutes of a movie. The cd isn't the same without it. This cd starts off high and doesn't let you down. If you want a band that actually puts thought into their music and makes music for a better reason then getting rich, you need to check out The Mars Volta.
B0001VWP8I|1.0|Anastacia's third album is a disappointing follow up to 2002's \\"Freak of Nature.\\"  Whereas \\"Freak of Nature\\" had a great mix of funk, R&B, and light rock that blended together very well and had strong production, \\"Anastacia\\" brings nothing but boring, bland faux-rock songs.  The only decent song is \\"Left Outside Alone.\\"  Other than that, all of the rest of the songs are plain and all sound alike.  The production was very weak this time around.  No strong ballads like \\"One Day In Your Life\\" or \\"You'll Never Be Alone\\" or anything edgy like \\"I Thought I Told You That\\" on this album.   <br /> <br />\\"Freak of Nature\\" sold poorly in the US even though it was a great album.  So this album is definitely not going to do any better here with all of the lousy tracks.
B00005JN0T|1.0|a friend loaned this to me over the weekend and i watched it on my laptop while enroute from LAX to JFK.  after the first 30 minutes, i had the urge to quit and do something else as this is really a boring movie.  the plot is predictabile, the same machine vs. men, humanity and love to all, hug the tree kind of deal.  as i already 'wasted' over half an hour on this movie, i decided to stay put and finish the movie... only to find out that the boredom continued.  even worse, this movie has no humor, takes itself too seriously as if the director has something to preach..... come to think of it, one star is too much but then, this is the lowest rating Amazon has for us.  can we have negative 5 stars in the future?
B0002OERI0|4.0|First let it be said I don't agree with all of the politics and polemics Green Day spews on American Idiot.  However, for anyone who says that the album is bad because of the politics or that it has politics doesn't know much about punk music (see: Sex Pistols, the Jam, most 80s hardcore American punk).  This also isn't a true punk album, as being an admitted concept album automatically makes it not punk.  What Green Day have done is take the core sound or first generation punk music, and infused the elements of more acoustic pop (i.e. Good Riddance, but nothing quite that soft on American Idiot), power pop and slightly harder rock and came up with a CD that is both forward looking and rooted in the basic left-leaning politics and sounds of punk.  The album is hard to listen to all the way through, as most punk-influenced albums are, and it does seem to play out a little too long, but overall in terms of scope and vision Green Day have created a CD, bordering on epic, that they will be hard-pressed to top.  The level of passion they display, both musically and lyrically, would be hard to better. <br /> <br />As for the person who complained about the video and stated sort of a \\"love it or leave it\\" attitude, you've completely missed the point.  In no way does the song or the video condemn America as you state, but they are simply showing their distaste for the current political climate in America.  Ironically, statements like yours are the kind of things that give the politics in American Idiot resonance.
0060977493|3.0|I generally enjoyed being thrust into this other culture, almost like evesdropping without the heat and mosquitos. Many good things here but you need a good memory to piece together the author's apparently well thoughtout jumbled time sequences. I thought of Toni Morrison or maybe Tony Morrison trying to write like William Faulkner. Anyway an interesting story - not for kids or the casual reader.
B000683VI4|2.0|Being the nice boyfriend that I am, I bought this movie for my girlfriend and watched it with her. The 2 stars I gave this film are for the simple fact that it made her happy.<br /><br />Anyone who is mildly intelligent can figure out essentially the whole plot in the first 5 minutes, and probably 2 minutes of that are the credits. Some movies can be predictable and enjoyable. However, others rely on a certain \\"twist\\" and the predictability kills the movie. Think about, say, the Sixth Sense. If you've seen it, imagine watching it knowing the twist at the end from sheer plot predictability. That's The Notebook in a nutshell. I suppose if you miss the obvious clues in the first 5 minutes and littered throughout the rest of the film, then maybe the twist would redeem the film.<br /><br />Once you know what's going to happen, the story fizzles. There's no compelling element because you know the outcome. The actors, who are mediocre at best, really don't help the story along.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're female, you're more likely to enjoy this. If you're a guy, only buy this as a gift for a female. Don't subject yourself to this atrocity of your own free will.
0553801546|5.0|I'm so glad I discovered Robin Hobbs!  I'm a woman, but I am leary of female writers as they tend to get maudlin and too \\"tidy\\".  I want pathos, action and unexpected plot twists! Ms Hobbs provides them all with admirable aplomb.  I'm left wondering at the Fool's Fate.  This cannot be all there is!!  I hope Ms Hobbs can write more of the ever intiguing Fool, he is an ammazing character! I was left utterly bereft when this series ended.  I was briefly saved when I read the Liveship series, but I'm adrift again.  Please write more!
B000002AGN|5.0|This is a top jazz album and worth including in your collection. Songs are all very classy but \\"Take Five\\" alone makes this record worthy of buying.
B00005JMYI|1.0|Tired of getting suckered by name recognition? <br />Then STAY AWAY from this one!  <br /> <br />What a floater
B000002ADT|5.0|This is a masterpiece that belongs to any musical collection and that includes non jazz collections. i will stop here as everything else has been said before!
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I was unfortunate enough to have wasted $6.50 and seen this horrible movie.  Don't even rent cause your curious to see how stupid it was. It was boring, slow, horribly acted and directed, and it had the worst scrip ever. You know when a movie is bad when during the serious, intense, scary moments the theater bursts out in laughter. And no the movie was not funny everyone was just laughing at how stupid it was. I couldn't even figure out the story line. But I do give credit to the 2 actors that acted in a nasty bathroom, for THE ENTIRE MOVIE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!
0385510454|1.0|After I read \\"Painted House\\", I told my wife to never, ever buy another Grisham book for me. She didn't listen, and once again I was disappointed. Grisham's first few books were very good, but \\"The Broker\\" was a terrible waste of paper. The whole premise of the book was ridiculous and uninformed, the characters and events unbelievable, the \\"Italian lessons\\" were filler, and of course, the ending...well, there wasn't an ending. So many potentially interesting characters (the Chinese assissin)that fell by the wayside in Grisham's apparent rush to finish the book and collect the check. Apparently, this book was written for the single purpose of paying for his new home on the outskirts of Oxford. The Final Insult...the author's note at the back of the book.
B00062IVKS|2.0|Maybe its my lifelong aversion to horror movies but this is 2+ hours of distilled unpleasantness. Anyone who has ever lived in NY or NJ knows guys like this, but so what.<br /><br />The one thing that might have redeemed Raging Bull would be if there was any light at all on why he was the way he was. And if that's too much to ask, I'd settle for why anybody would make a movie about him.<br /><br />In the end its really just a brilliant portrayal of an angry lowlife.
B000001F7R|3.0|This has never been one of my top favorites, but it was a good start for Def Leppard.  A good album for 1980.  It got them off the ground and quality songs like \\"Rock Brigade\\", \\"Hello America\\" and \\"Wasted\\" demonstrated the bands potential and hinted of great things to come in the future.  Recommended for diehard fans.
B000003TAW|5.0|<br />All the tracks on this CD rock! I bought this cd when it first came out in 94 and was absolutely charmed. I couldnt put it down for almost 8 months. Me and my younger brother would learn all the songs and air guitared it making an excellent jam o rama in our bedroom. Since then Weezer has only improve their music instrumentally and lyrically, but this one remains to keep the raw energy of their not so humble beginnings. A MUST HAVE for any collection. CLASSIC WEEZER: Holiday, Only in dreams, My name is jonas and No one else are the best tracks
B000000OR9|5.0|This is such an underrated album!  I love John Sykes' big guitar riffs.  The songs are a bit long and complex, and some repeat listening is needed to fully appreciate them.  The effort is well rewarded.  If you liked the 1987 Whitesnake album (which featured John Sykes on guitar), you should have \\"Blue Murder\\".  All killer and no filler on this record.
B000002H92|5.0|<br />This was my first Doors CD ever, I bought it back in 1992 when I was 11. I was just amazed of the energy Morrison could proyect on stage. This Double live album includes the LP's : Absolutely Live, Alive she cried and Live at the Hollywood Bowl with minor arrangements in the track order. You wont hear the differences, the songs are perfectly matched and mixed you wont believe they are from different shows. Instead of spending all your money on the three CDS, buy this collection for a fair amount, buy the three separated only if you want the track order and a few more songs here and there. Anyway, listen to it and judge yourself. Best Live Doors album.
B00000IMTE|5.0|After leaving Deep Purple, guitar wizard Ritchie Blackmore launched a brand new band called Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio. This is their first and best album.  <br />Here are discriptions of each song; <br /> <br />1-Man on the Silver Mountain, one of Rainbows most popular songs,but not one of my favourites. <br /> <br />2-Self Portrait, definately the best on the album, with a dramatic chorus and intense guitar, it's definately the best <br /> <br />3-Black Sheep of the Family, this was first recorded by Quartermass and it's definately a high point on the album <br /> <br />4-Catch the Rainbow, A very well done song with very interesting vocals <br /> <br />5-Snake Charmer, Not bad at all <br /> <br />6-Temple of the King, A nice ballad that shows that Blackmore isn't always a heavy metal wild-man <br /> <br />7-If You Don't Like Rock n Roll, Very strange indeed  <br /> <br />8-Sixteenth Century Greensleeves, Simply a masterpiece <br /> <br />9-Still I'm Sad, I great instrumental to close the album <br /> <br />I highly recomend it to any true fan of the heavy metal/medievel genre. Enjoy!!

B000268QB2|5.0|On their debut, 'Hopes & Fears,' Keane school their contemporaries on making an album that is pop gold despite the absence of a guitar. <br /> <br />From the disc's piano driven 'Somewhere Only We Know' to the final track 'Bedshaped,' Tim Rice-Oxley proves that a pianist can rock just as hard as a guitarist. Accompanied by Richard Hughes on drums, the two compliment one another and make beautiful music throughout the entire album. Each track is made even that more superb by singer Tom Chaplin's distinct voice. Excercising range and discipline, Chaplin's voice booms over the piano and drums during the crescendo in songs like 'Bend And Break,' 'This Is The Last Time' and 'We Might As Well Be Strangers.' Elsewhere his vocals are soft and subtle, blending beautifully with the music yet never getting lost in it. <br /> <br />In 'Everybody's Changing,' a fan favorite and ode to being lost in the crowd, Keane manage to capture that universal feeling of trying to stay afloat in life. Chaplin's vocals are almost melancholic yet hint at an air of comfort, the kind that comes from knowing that others are lost, too.  <br /> <br />Keane excel at pop music with substance and manage to latch onto different universal emotions throughout the album. In many ways 'Hopes & Fears' lives up to its name - in some places it preys upon the hope of finding love or finding yourself, while in others it expresses the fears of being alone or losing love. <br /> <br />'Hopes & Fears' is one of the more brilliant foreign albums to get an American release. Pick up a copy and let this trio from Battle amaze you.
B00006879E|4.0|I love rock/pop, sinphonic, and progresive rock from the sixties and seventies....bands like the beatles, pink floyd, led zeppelin, genesis, yes, elo, elp, and lot more have influenced me, and i hate almost all bands noww.....there are some bands, like the strokes (which in my opinion is the best rock band of the moment),all the brit pop movement, colplay, blur, oasis, maybe this two new bands Franz ferdinand and Jet, and my new discovery Maroon 5....i bought the album, here in argentina they sell the expanded edition....and i think its great....the mix of rock/pop, with a little bit of funk, and R&B, makes a great combination.....the best songs of the album are Sunday Morning, Must get out (which remembers me of a Paul mcartney composition with the beatles, in the chorus), She will be loved, and this love.....but the hole album is great, and Rag Doll, one of the bonus tracks in this edition, also kicks ass.....im glad they won the grammy for best new artist...
B00005JLEX|5.0|...I would have retired at 35!<br /><br />This show defined an entire generation.  There is nothing you can say about Jerry Seinfeld and his talented cast of riot makers that will ever fully encompass what an impact on comedy this series had, and continues to have.  Facial expressions were born, dances were created, attitudes and catch-phrases sprung out from across the nation.<br /><br />What fan doesn't know the significance of THE PARKING SPOT?  Or why THE CHINESE RESTAURANT caused such frustration.  These and other classic episodes are all included in this first set.<br /><br />The additional outtakes, added commentary, and other goodies make it a must-have for any die hard fan, or anyone living under a crusty old rock who just wants to laugh out loud!<br /><br />Enjoy this but by all means get Seasons 3 also with such great episodes as THE PEZ DISPENSER, THE SUBWAY and THE RED DOT.<br /><br />Can't wait till they roll out the rest of them!!! Worth every penny.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Film Noir, as it was filmed in black and white in the late 40's, early 50's is divided into three distinct categories. For the lowbrow, there is the brilliant Detour, so primitive and shot so cheaply, yet delivering a massive result.  Then there is The Big Heat with Glenn Ford, a middlebrow film with the dark shadows, tragedy, and cynicism of Noir.  Finally, for the highbrows, we have Billy Wilder's finest film, a true landmark dripping with edgy cynicism by a man that lost his parents to the Holocaust.    In Sunset Boulevard William Holden gives his finest performance.  Holden is a very likable man and that comes through on the screen no matter which role he performs, but always that All-American persona, that likeability leaks to the screen.  Part of this quality is his obvious intelligence.  As Norma Desmond's kept man, he knows it's wrong, at times it's downright creepy, but he works with Billy Wilder's vision and melds a bizarre group of Hollywood types into an indictment of the industry up to 1950.      Are exploitation, the money grubbing, and the status quest pertaining only to the early era of Hollywood?  I don't think so.  Ha, ha, ask Jessica Simpson, Jana Jamison, Michael Jackson, adnauseam.       Gloria Swanson is a great actress.  She lures Joe Gillis like a black widow spider.  Her delirium is a cross between silent movie actress and Betty Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Perhaps Davis got the idea from Gloria's earlier film.  Curiously, Betty's 1950 picture All About Eve won the Oscar.  It is a fine film, but SB scared the studio heads, indeed horrified them, and the picture was passed over.  Anyhow, this was a comeback for Swanson and she went for it.  I don't know if she did a lot of work after this film, but it solidified her reputation as a Prima-Donna film actress.  Her performance is unforgettable.    Also kudos for Erich von Stroheim  as Max, Nora's butler, ex-husband, and first director.  Stroheim indeed was a fine silent film director and remarkable in Renoir's Grand Illusion.  This fellow looks like he was born to wear the Kaiser's helmet.      Finally, Nancy Olsen, pulled from obscurity, a college girl from Wisconsin, she is lovely as Holden's inspiration, and love interest.  Her wholesomeness certainly contrasted with all the other grubby Hollywood types in the film.    I have seen thousand's of films; many are of very high quality.  I can't rattle them all off for you, but SB is in the top 25.  Think about that!
B00008EY65|1.0|This movie would appeal to 12 year olds if it wasent for all that nazi\ocult mumbo jumbo. There's no cursing either. Well im sorry but when your grabbed by a 40 ft darklord from the portol of zadar or whatever it was you say more then 'oh crap'. Hitlers main assasin started out as rather menacing but the way he was disposed...well it was so anti-climatic. I was expecting a showdown. Selma blair plays the same dumb idiot with the same dumb voice in every movie. The script was horrific. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy at first. Oh yeah and the whole romance thing, a mean the shear mechanics of hellboy and firegirl getting it on are mind-bogling. Lets hope there's a spare shower cap in the bathroom other wise we might have to sit through hellboy 2:the spawn of hellboy and firegirl. The whole rasputin\nazi crossover was stupid. And that fish man? did he have a point in this. Jonathan hurt is a fantastic actor, its an embarassment to think he even accepted such a role. Save your money. If your looking for a superhero flick then watch x men or that old 80 cartoon, super ted(my favorite superhero) *starts singing* 'super ted shoots through the air, like a streak of red! Suuuuuuper ted...Superted!' Superted is this teddybare that was going to be thown away until a yellow and green alien named spotty rescues him an takes him to mother earth and she turns him into a super hero. He and spotty then have to fight against  a gay skeleton called bones and an evil texan called tex. Sound improbable? It makes more sense then hellboy.
B000000H66|5.0|This is easily the best death metal record,and one of the best metal albums.I am not a big DM fan,but I LOVE this album.It really sucks that Chuck died so young.He was an awesome guitarist,and a great singer for this style.He has a growl that you can understand.Second guitarist Bobby Koelble is good,but nowhere near as good as Chuck.Gene Hoglan and Kelly Conlon were one of the best rhythm sections in metal.Every song on here is awesome,but I would have to say my favorite is \\"Crystal Mountain\\",followed by \\"Symbolic\\",\\"Crystal Mountain\\" and \\"1,000 Eyes\\".Overall,this is a must have for any death metal fan.  R.I.P Chuck  We miss you forever
B00064MW6K|3.0|3 1/2 stars. I realized with a smile about 20 minutes into \\"Catwoman\\" that it was actually an alright movie. Not quite worthy of 4 stars, but almost there. It doesn't have the best acting, and some of the CGI is a little cheap looking, but over-all, this isn't a terrible movie. People may have told you that this a truly terrible movie, like people told me, or they may have said that it was great. There is no in-between with this one. I may be the only exception! This film deserved more recognition than it got, and it also deserved a bigger audience. The box office was dismal (opening on the same day as \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", this movie grossed 13 million less in its entire run than \\"Supremacy\\" got in its opening weekend) and the reviews were terrible, but I liked it and I do not know why. The acting is actually alright, as is the production value and the plot, but like I said earlier, it messes itself up in the visual effects department. When there should be a relatively real looking image of a person leaping from a building onto a motorcycle, we see a distorted frame that looks like it was lifted from the \\"Spitrix\\" (what I call things that look like a combination between \\"Spiderman\\" and \\"The Matrix\\"). But that doesn't really matter since there are less than a handful of those scenes. There is, however, a scene about an hour into the movie in a nightclub that is impossibly stupid, and I actually found myself laughing. This unfortunate scene almost ruined the movie for me.  <br /> <br />The violence in the movie is surreal and almost addled with craziness as the film slowly conjeals into one long 45 minute chase/shootout/smackdown. Some of the films romantic scenes and aspects between the Benjamin Bratt and Halle Berry characters are sweet, but at some points a little too suggary for the films context of revenge and dark betrayl. The ferris wheel sequence, for instance, is the perfect example of how the film moves too many genres into a single scene. One minute there is a little love going on, and then there seems to be a person in need of rescuing.  <br /> <br />The setup is something that everyone should know, hopefully, at this point. Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a graphic designer working at an advertising agency. One night, while delivering an add, Patience hears something that was not meant for her ears. So she is killed and thrown into the ocean. When she awakes the next morning, she realizes that she can leap onto the rafters of her apartment. This is an interesting part of the movie, as Patiences apartment looks like that of a celebrities and not a graphic designer. But anyway, Patience decides to avenge her death, and she does so, along with starting up a steamy relationship with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt). Their relationship takes a turn for the better when Tom gives Patience a clearer understanding of her duties as a Catwoman, even though he is oblivious to the fact of who she is.  <br /> <br />The final action sequence is amazing and worth the 1:35 minute build-up. The final scene, however, left me wanting more. I know that knowone else has said this, and knowone else probably will say this, but I want a sequel.  <br /> <br />Rating Evaluation: None (Scenes never happen). Mild (Scenes happen two or fewer times). Moderate (Scenes happen at least a few times). Heavy (There are many scenes  throughout the movie). Extreme (Scenes are continuous from beginning to end in the movie).  <br /> <br />Violence: Heavy: (Several bloody shootings, a nonlethal though bloody stabbing, fist fights, and a falling death).  <br />Profanity: Moderate: (Not many strong usages, but a few usages of tamer words).  <br />Sex/Nudity: Mild (One scene that is quite understated). <br />Drugs/Alchohol: None.  <br />
B00001W9G0|3.0|Please don't take the review title as a putdown, because it's seriously not; it's just that the film is told entirely from the perspective of the Streisand character, and almost entirely revolves around her passion for the Redford character.  I just can't relate. <br /> <br />But the film is absolutely gorgeous.  It's really a shame that cinematographer Harry Stradling, Jr., didn't win an Oscar (it went instead to something called \\"Cries and Whispers\\") or at least the art direction or costumes should've gotten a statue (those both went to \\"The Sting,\\" so at least that makes sense).   <br /> <br />The story is an engaging one, as the Jewish American Communist played by Streisand falls in unrequited love with Redford's All-American Boy character in college, only to unexpectedly meet him again several years later and gradually win his heart.  She encourages his reticent writing talent, boosting his confidence and helping him fine-tune his style, until he is a successful novelist and Hollywood screenwriter.  (Many will be turned off by the way this strong woman so thoroughly subjugates her uncompromising politics and personality to his, becoming a more or less typical housewife, but at least this film takes place in and around the WWII years when this happened far more often than today; it also underscores her love for him.) <br /> <br />Ultimately I have to believe that the tearjerker aspect of this film has to do with women identifying with Streisand's loss when Redford leaves her, and their subsequent meeting on a street corner years later.  What red-blooded heterosexual female wouldn't be struck with a sense of loss of such love these characters shared, especially of a man the ilk of Redford?  Athlete, former naval officer, Hollywood golden boy? <br /> <br />Needless to say, no tears were shed here at the film's conclusion.  It's an extremely well-made film, but aimed at a female audience, so it didn't draw me in much at all.  Doubtless, however, fans of the film and/or of Streisand will be delighted at her extensive involvement in the making of this DVD.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|Anyone that says this was a dissapointing of stupid movie just wasn't able to keep up with it or not true fans of the genre.  This was without a doubt the best suspence movie since Seven.  It was filled with twists and turns that kept everyone guessing.  And even if you find the movie somewhat difficult to follow (which can happen if your really not into the movie or have to miss a scene) the end of the movie is WELL worth the wait!!
B00002Z88D|2.0|Metallica hasn't released a good album at all since the black album (which was only ok, it wasn't that great and was definately overrated). Metallica attempted to pull a zeppelin and perform with an orchestra. Neat idea, but this performance was lackluster and uninspired. James lost his voice, Kirk's guitar playing is still sloppy, and it's just pathetic how Metallica attempts to soldier on without their old sound. I wouldn't recommend this album at all.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Sorry you die-hard Radiohead fans, but this album is far from perfect, as many of you seem to think.  Sure, there are moments of brilliance that have you scrambling to replay a certain song, but a lot of the material on this album is garbage.  All the distorted background noise, the slurred vocals, the off-beat electronic beats...you can call it art if you want, and I guess it is art, but some art sucks.  I'm an accomplished musician, and I assume the members of Radiohead are too, so I'm stuck here wondering why, if they're good musicians, do they put all the crap they do on their records?  Weird for the sake of weird?  Most likely.  Their ploy has worked, and they've become famous for their weirdness.  I like Radiohead a lot, and they've produced some of my favorite songs of the last decade or so, but come on, a lot of what they play is just noise.  OK Computer is a great album without all the noise crap that ruins their later \\"experimental\\" ones.  They'd be making better music with their OK Computer mentality, but I guess they wouldn't have their weirdness which gives them such a strange appeal, especially to people who are dying to be different.  So pretend to enjoy all their stuff.  I, for one, will enjoy what I can and skip the rest.  The best song on Amnesiac is Life in a Glass House.  The fusion of the jazz music is incredible.  I can't get enough of it.  Complex is good.  Weird isn't.
0920668372|1.0|Let me ask you a couple of things:  <br />1.How would you feel about your mother sneaking into your room on her hands and knees and watching you sleep and then cuddling you like a baby when you are a teenager? \\"My mom gives me reassuring hugs\\" - ok. \\"My mom rocks me to sleep and sneaks into my room\\" - wimpy and creepy <br /> <br />2. You are about 25 yrs old. Do you think it's normal for your mother to drive out to your house with a ladder, sneak into your room via burglar style, stare at you and continue to rock you to sleep? There must've been a reason for you moving out of your house in the first place right? So she is coming back every night and has to climb through the window as opposed to the door because....why? <br /> <br />3.

B0000X61VE|5.0|I have been waiting forever to find this workout on DVD - FINALLY! I purchased this back in 1992 as a video and it kicked my butt!  I was 20 pounds over weight and lost all of it in a month.   <br /> <br />I ran sprints for 3 miles a day, biked 1 hour at 18 mph's on a stationary bike and did this video. It improved my strength soooo very much!  I don't recommend that you start out doing this tape to the full reps etc. if you are out of shape - start out with no weights at all if you are out of shape and build up.  <br /> <br />don't listen to the B.S. that you are hearing that its UNSAFE. learn the exercise first slowly and then do it.  I have just purchased it on DVD and can't wait for it to arrive at my door.  I just LOVE IT! <br /> <br />:)
B000683VI4|5.0|I LOVED this movie. I very rarely can say that about a movie based on a book, but I truly loved this movie. It has you twisting in your seat, laughing, and not only crying but maybe even sobbing. \\"Tear jerker\\" movies rarely get me crying, however this one did it to me. The movie version differed from the book somewhat, and the ending was completely different, however I wouldn't change one thing about the film version. James Garner deserves an Oscar for his performance, and in my opinion this was his best performance yet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  It is a worthwhile old-fashioned romance that even cynics would enjoy.
B000093FLA|5.0|This a great film that is well-edited, Brilliantly scored and masterfully acted. And now, a basic overview of the film:    The music-AMAZING. Perfectly matching the film's fast-paced caper nature, the best 2 songs in the film are \\"F***ing in the Bushes\\" by Oasis, played in the final fight scene of the film and \\"Diamond\\" by Klint. This song is played in the menu screen and in the character introduction sequence in the film.    The Editing- Crafty and sleek, smooth and mixed. The two best scenes in which Guy Ritchie's imagination is set free are in the character introduction sequence, where each character is shown doing something which blends into the next. For example, when a character named Mickey (played very well by Brad Pitt) picks up a jewelry bag, he is shown throwing it and in a quick change of scenery, another character, Vinny, is shown catching it. The other scene in which the editing is brilliant is in the final bare-knuckle boxing match at the end of the film. The impact of each punch is shown and the sequence switches from fast-motion to slow motion to regular, somehow keeping it from becoming confusing.    The characters- One of the main things I love about this film is the many different unique characters, all of which are introduced in the beginning of the film. The main characters are...    Brick Top- A ruthless gangster whos favorite means of dispatch involves feeding the dead to pigs, (not that gross in the film). As the main enemy in the film, he is the perpetrator of many of the problems that the characters face in the film.     Bullet-Tooth Tony- A bounty-hunter/killer/convincing intimidator for hire who is not all as bad as he sounds. A hilarious character played brilliantly by Vinnie Jones. In a comic twist, this character was shot 6 times in one sitting and had the bullets molded into gold and put in as fillings in his teeth. A very intimidating and funny character who adds to the film greatly.    Vinny & Sol- Two very funny jewelry store owners who are hired by Boris the Blade(mentioned later) to rob Brick Top's illegal bookies. The robbery goes terribly and hilariously wrong. These two sarcastic and teasing characters are a pair of idiots who somehow become mixed up into the story.    Tyrone- Vinny & Sol's hired getaway driver who isn't much of a driver at all. The sequence in which it takes him forever to get out of the car makes me laugh hysterically every time.    Boris the Blade- Otherwise known as Boris the Bullet-dodger. An impossible to kill, sneeky and devious weapon-selling russian who hires Vinny & Sol to rob Brick Top's bookies and steal the diamond which started all the mayhem from Franky Four-Fingers(mentioned later).    Franky Four-Fingers- The gambling-obsessed thief who steals the diamond that starts the mayhem.    Turkish and Tommy- Turkish is a boxing promoter who works for Brick Top, against his will, and Tommy is his trouble-prone partner.    Mickey- My personal favorite character, Mickey is a gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion who is barely understandable throughout the movie but is still very important to the plot.      The plot- Although very confusing to explain, the plot is simply a loy of mayhem coming from one stolen diamond. Believe me, it's better than it sounds.    A well-made and brilliant film that is a must-see for film-lovers everywhere.  Post your opinion please.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Great direction, beautiful imagery, top-notch acting, and a heartwarming story define the masterpiece that is Lost in Translation.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen play two Americans who meet while visiting Tokyo, both disillusioned with their lives and marriages.  Their time spent together and the relationship that develops conveys the message that this life we're living contains infinite opportunities and possibilities and that as long as we're alive, we have the power to be happy. <br /> <br />Watch this one with an open, attentive mind, and prepare to be moved.
B0006GAOCW|3.0|As I first saw previews for FIRST DAUGHTER, I thought it looked like a really cute movie. I never saw it in theatres, but I rented it today, and I can't say I was too impressed by it. <br /> <br />FIRST DAUGHTER is about the president's daughter (played by Katie Holmes, who I find really likeable). She feels like she's being treated like a little kid, even though she's heading off to college, and she just wants some more freedom. Of course, she gets watched over all the time, and when she gets to college it isn't any different. Along the way, she makes friends with Mia, her roommate that's always looking for a good time, and James, her RA. Just as Samantha starts to fall for James, she finds out that he has a huge secret. <br /> <br />I enjoyed FIRST DAUGHTER, but the storyline was really predictable and somewhat forgettable. It seemed like it was trying too hard to be the next Princess Diaries, and if that's your kind of movie, I'd recommend getting FIRST DAUGHTER. <br /> <br />Overall grade - C

Frankly, almost any <br />book on industrial safety would make a better <br />substitute for this book. &#8220;Blink&#8221; & Mr. Gladwell <br />killed a lot of trees and spilled much ink to  <br />never quite manage to say: <br />More training leads to fewer accidents. <br />

B00062IVKI|5.0|By combining this hommage to, and critique of, stylized Hollywood musicals with 70's improvisational acting Scorsese achieves a near-ideal marriage of form and content. Those less comfortable with life's complexities may have trouble with this film, the rest of us can revel in its pitch-perfect performances and the treat of having our cake and eating it too. Godard's favorite Scorsese film, and mine.
B0002858YS|5.0|My cousin in london first introduced me to the killers with songs like mr brightside, somebody told me, & all these things that I've done. He kept playing and playing it on his phone. I soon started to like them more and more! So the next day, I went to HMV and bought the album already cause I love their msuic so much! I don't regret a single thing!
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I've always thought Michael Buble had a great voice, but that <br />there was something lacking in his first CD.  I heard it at <br />friends' homes several times, yet never plunked down the money <br />to buy my own copy.  But the other day I was listening to the <br />radio and heard his new song \\"Home\\", which I just loved.  He <br />sounds fantastic on it, sincere and touching.  It's a bit of <br />a departure for him.  Not big-bandy or swinging, it's a sort <br />of James Taylor meets Bobby Darin type song.  Acoustic guitars, <br />strings etc on a poignant cut about missing your loved one(s). <br />Like his wonderful take on \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" <br />from his first CD, it's an example of excellent vocalizing. <br />And it's by far the best cut on \\"It's Time\\".  The CD is a mixed <br />bag of standards, some \\"classic R & B lite\\", and a few songs <br />that are a little too \\"swingeroo\\" for their own good.  I think <br />Michael does way better with ballads than the uptempo stuff. <br />When he digs down and really sings a love song, it's believable <br />and beautiful.  But does the world really need another young <br />singer trying to channel Sinatra?  I think he'd be well advised <br />to try his hand at more songwriting (he co-wrote \\"Home\\") and <br />leave the shooby-dooing to other, less-talented singers.  He <br />has the potential to really make his mark, and doing Frank's <br />arrangement of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" won't get him there. <br />Also, at least Nelson Riddle is credited with the arrangement. <br />But the arrangement of \\"Feeling Good\\" which opens the disc is a <br />total ripoff of Nina Simone's version, and one wonders why no <br />credit was given there.  But that's a minor quibble.  This CD <br />will certainly please Michael's fans; it's better than the <br />first one.  If you're looking for something new and different, <br />you won't find it here.  But if you like pleasant singing that <br />is easy on the ear, you will enjoy this.
0140157352|5.0|From \\"Getting to Yes\\":     \\"Reading the pamphlet on the Royal Canadian Air Force exercises will not make you physically fit. Studying books on tennis, swimming, riding a bicycle, or riding a horse will not make you an expert. Negotiation is no different.\\"    Wise words indeed. Anyone expecting a \\"how-to\\" method from any book on negotiation is in the wrong field of study. The best one can expect is a general framework, and that is what this book provides.    Fisher and Ury advocate what they refer to as \\"principled negotiation\\", a style of negotiation where there are no winners and losers. Agreements are reached rationally by considering the motives each party has for maintaining a their position. People are separated from the issues at hand, and emotions are controlled. There is a strong emphasis on rationality, using objective criteria.    Unfortunately, human beings aren't always capable of controlling their emotions and being rational. Or sometimes simply refuse to negotiate. Fisher and Ury recognize this, and provide a framework for tackling these issues, centered on what they call BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).    Overall a great book, but, as the authors themselves would concede, no substitution to negotiation experience.
1400082773|4.0|Barack Obama is lauded as a presidential hopeful, as he is charming, intelligent and personable, in character and driven to achieve. The powerful drives within Obama moves him to search out his roots (reminds me of the quest of Alex Haley, author of Roots)seeking to find himself through his past. This moving and insightful memoir, extols the virtues of family, dedication and perserverance from a personal point of view,while maintaining an emotional connection with the reader. I believe this account may one day rate with the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.
0316286443|3.0|This book seems to suffer from identity disorder, despite the strong personality of its author.  The book's intentions seem unclear to me, and that is what keeps it just average. <br />I was drawn to this book by the wonderful photos of Aucoin's beauty transformations.  He was, without question, a talented man.  Among other feats in this book, he transforms Martha Stewart into Veronica Lake, Gwyneth Paltrow into James Dean (!)and a male friend into Linda Evangelista.  Yet I must say that this is not the best hands-on guide for the average woman.  Each photo is accompanied by step-by-step instructions.  Sounds like a good  idea, in theory.  But as I perused this book, I found myself wondering what good those instructions would do.  This was especially the case as I read the section entitled \\"Dimensions.\\"  Take, for example, the transformation of Gena Rowlands into Ava Gardner.  Now, as a makeup amateur, I can try to follow the author's instructions: \\"Prep the skin with moisturizer...A touch of concealer...face is set with loose translucent face powder...brows are groomed and solidly defined using a basic brown eyebrow pencil and softened with dark brown powder eyeshadow and a sponge-tip applicator...\\"  But these instructions will not avail much. The first problem with this approach is that I'm NOT a professional makeup artist.  Following Aucoin's instructions are not going to transform me into an Ava Gardner lookalike.  The instructions come across as more of a mental checklist for Aucoin than anything.  I mean, if I'm a professional basket weaver, and you're not, and I say \\"Weave some stiff yellow straw in with some brown straw, and accent with blue dyed-straw flowers along the handle,\\" your basket is going to look nothing like mine despite step-by-step instructions.   <br />The second problem is that, unless I'm going to a costume party, I don't WANT to emulate Ava Gardner, Veronica Lake, or James Dean (cute as he was).  The same holds true of the last two sectionsof the book, which include some original, unusual, and inspired makeup looks.     <br />In other words, Aucoin gives instruction on how to create these faboulous faces, but following his instructions without the benefit of his expert hand and artistic eye will not yield anything like his results. Even the first section, which includes promising headlines like \\"Shape: Eyes\\" and \\"Makeup: Texture\\" are actually more of the same--great photos with cursory instructions on how to recreate them. The author should not have bothered giving step-by-step instructions for these looks-they do not endow the reader with what it takes to create them: great talent.  He should have just marketed this as a coffe-table type book, designed to showcase his remarkable talent, his creativity, and the power of makeup when in extremely talented hands. <br />If you do decide to purchase the book for cosmetics advice, my advice to you is to just try to emulate specific elements of the faces within.  Examples include the eyes from the Sophia Loren look or the cupid's bow mouth from the Alla Nazimova look.  Indeed, taking anything away from this book, cosmetics-wise, requires selective editing on the reader's part. <br />Okay, so Aucoin doesn't quite fit the bill as an instructor to the masses, and perhaps he should have just stuck to a glossy book of photos to display his talents.  But wait!  There's an additional \\"Dimension\\" to the book that complicates things further!  Why, it's politics!  <br />In the introduction, Aucoin says he wants to help women take over the world.  He comments on the oppressed 50s, and \\"the inevitability and beauty of a unified world.\\"  He even oh-so-kindly reminds the reader that \\"conservative means withholding and liberal means generosity.\\"  Now, I know he was a stellar person, if I'm to believe all of his famous friends and fans.  I'm sure he didn't have bad intentions.  But I certainly didn't buy the book to hear that stuff, and I, the purchaser of a beauty book, don't care to become the sounding board for his politcs! <br />Aucoin also fills the book with his mutual-admiration society of celebrity friends.  He admits in the introduction that the book will include lots of praise.  This is, however, an understatement.  Every single model in the book is a friend of his, most of them are celebrities, and, well gee, they're all just such **great** people!  I'm aware Aucoin was famous for his friendships with celebrities, and I mean no disrespect to him.  I just found the salivating over all of these celebs a little annoying.   <br />My overall advice on buying this book, in conclusion, is that it should be purchased with caution.  If you're just looking for photos of beautiful/transformative maquillages, go for it but don't bother with the text.  If you are a fan of Kevyn Aucoin as a person or don't mind a hearty serving of politics and celebrity name-dropping, then this would be a good read for you.  However, if you're just looking for a guide to applying cosmetics, your money would be better spent elsewhere.  <br />
B0002MB7QW|5.0|...chilled to-150 degrees! that's cold! this movie has way more action than i could comprehend, like the hail in japan, snow in india, tornadoes in los angeles, and finally a tidal wave submerging new york. there was a sad moment in this movie, and that was when frank sacrificed himself to save jason and jack. the highlight of this movie is when the eye of the \\"hurricane\\" passes over new york and everything ices up. there was a funny thing about it and that was that a nerd actually became a hero. disaster freaks ought to snatch this one up.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I was a little apprehensive about viewing this film, but after watching it, I must say that my eyes have been opened a little wider than before.  As a staunch Bush supporter, I was afraid that Moore was going to slam him and his policies unmercifully, but instead, he provides stimulating \\"food for thought\\".  For example, I found his analysis of Andrew Card's informing Bush of the attack on the World Trade Center very disturbing.  I didn't know that Bush sat in the classroom for almost ten minutes before doing anything.  That is simply unacceptable, even to a die-hard Republican such as myself. <br /> <br />I found Moore's analysis of the Iraq war to be very interesting.  The interviews with the soldiers and family members were especially emotional, especially in the case of Lila Lipscomb, who tearfully reads a letter she received from her son just days before he was killed in a Blackhawk helicpoter crash.  Other scenes, such as the soldier describing the type of music that they liked to listen to when going on attack (\\"Let the mother#@%^& burn!\\") was very disturbing to me.  Finally, being a parent myself, the scenes of the dead Iraqi children were especially difficult to watch. <br /> <br />There are many items pointed out in the film that I had no idea about, especially the Bush family link to Saudi oil, and how members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the United States after the terrorist attacks, even though all flights in the United States had been banned.   <br /> <br />Moore also looks at the disputed 2000 presidential election and claims that George W. Bush was elected by his father's  <br />\\"friends on the Supreme Court\\".  The errors of the networks in projecting a winner in Florida on election night is also looked at. <br /> <br />I have been and always will be a Bush supporter, but I must admit that this film has opened my eyes more about him and revealed things that I didn't know before.  I thought that this was a very thought-provoking filmand it did a very good job at explaining Bush's past and some of the events in his presidency that may have been handled incorrectly.  Moore also manages to add a little humor, such as when Bush and his cabinet members are being made up for television, or when John Ashcroft tries his hand at a singing career.  I highly recommend this film.  If you are liberal or conservative, this film will open your eyes and give you a new perspective on the president of the United States.
1401200605|4.0|Having literally just read this trade paperback, I'm slightly embarrassed that I didn't pick this up on the newstand.  (I'm not one to give much credence to hype...)      To paraphrase the storyline in writer Jeph Loeb's own words in the introduction, this is Batman done \\"just right.\\"  Nearly everything is here: incredible Batman gadgets; short by sweet acknowledgements to past Caped Crusader stories (\\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" \\"Farewell to a Friend,\\" \\"Knightfall\\"); a host of baddies from Batman's rogues gallery; clever, tight dialogue; kick-ass art; tension between Batman and Superman (yet always, an underlying respect); just enough dry humor to balance the serious drama... The list could go on.    I'm floored.  Loeb even nailed Bruce Wayne's character.  That, in many  ways, is the sign of a solid Batman scribe.  I absolutely loved Bruce flirting with Lois Lane!  That scene in the Daily Planet with her calling Clark Kent \\"Smallville\\" is what makes that issue in \\"Hush\\" and the animated Batman/Superman feature movie top notch.  Most writers have no problem nailing down the Dark Knight, but the man under the cowl tends to escape most writers.      I admit it: I've never been that impressed with Jim Lee's previous artwork (it's been too generic, overblown and uninspired), but man, he did the Batman universe with great flair.  Gotham, Metropolis and their inhabitants are dramatic without being too much, which is what I think Lee has done before.  His Lois Lane is WAY too busty and super model-ish, but Lee's Poison Ivy and most especially, Catwoman, are amazingly sexy.  Killer Croc leaves quite a bit to be desired, but... I'm willing to overlook Croc, the shorter Bat-ears and plain Bat-symbol, because Lee's moody Batman, Bruce Wayne, Alfred and the rest are spot on.      I'm a long-time diehard Batman fan.  I've not been pleased with the artwork - much less the storylines - in the Batman titles in recent years.  So this is refreshing to see Loeb and Lee hit Batman out ofthe park.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|let me preface this by saying not only do i not enjoy this movie, i hate this movie and everything it stands for.  i have made enemies talking about this movie.  i would give it 0 stars if i could, but well at least squarepusher is on the soundtrack, though now i've lost points for him too.  my major problems with this movie are as follows: the main characters are jerks(portrayed favorably), its racist towards the japanese, it perpetuates the notion that japan has lost something in modern times (similar to being racist), and its overall pretentious and boring.  let me elaborate: <br /> <br />1.  the main characters are terrible people.  i think i should mention that i lived in japan for a year, studying abroad, yes i'm white, and i've been to almost all the places in the movie (that hotel aside).  speaking for myself and my foreign friends who were there, our first weeks there were awesome.  its completely different than america (or anywhere else i've been), theres so many places you want to go, you want to try new foods, go out, meet people, everything.  people ask me if i can relate to this movie, no i can't.  the main characters in the movie were filthy rich, staying at the nicest hotel in tokyo, and didn't enjoy themselves at all.  they were nothing but bitter to everyone.  the only characters in the movie who were at all inspired (maybe aside from the japanese party people) were the guy with the fishermans hat talking about making hip-hop beats (who they laughed at and left), and possibly the dumb blonde girl (she was dumb, but maybe she had potential?).  the two main characters just cried a lot.  if you think you can relate to them i'm sorry, get a hold of yourself. <br /> <br />2.  this movie is racist, in that all japanese people are portrayed as 1 dimensional, ignorant, and shallow.  examples i'm thinking of the surfer guys at the party (treated similar to the hip-hop guy mentioned above, i mena obviously what would the japanese know about surfing right?),the prostitute, film director, etc.  none of them are real developed characters.  perhaps its true that many travellers to japan don't really get to meet japanese people on a personal level, but if thats the case, well they've missed out and they should shut their mouths rather than perpetuate stereotypes.  jokes about L's and R's get old fast.  Scenes like the prostitute, and the guy with the bb gun, are, um, unrealistic at best.  but i'm not the only one who thinks its racist.  see [...] for more examples (no this isn't my site). <br /> <br />3.  the idea that japan has lost something of its beauty from ancient times.  the only example of this would be when the girl gets out of tokyo to the snow covered temple in Nara.  Well this is a nice image, and its \\"the japan which once was\\", something lost in the modern maze of consumer culture, etc.  people who feel this way may or may not believe that all japanese pre WWII were zen monks, or samurai, or artisans.  no.  while things are different about japanese culture now no doubt, there is a different kind of beauty outside of quiet temples.  perhaps one might prefer the quiet temple historical kind, but in that case, stay home, read a history book, and don't be another brainwashed japan-o-phile touring the country complaining whenever they aren't at a tourist trap ::cough cough kyoto and nara cough cough:: <br /> <br />4.  this movie is boring, and pretentious.  if you think the photography is beautiful, well perhaps it is, but thats how japan actually looks, so be impressed with the locations, not the film..  also if you think silence is meaningful try meditation.  bah, this movie is just boring. <br /> <br />bottom line, if you saw this film and you liked it, don't talk to me about about it and don't ever go to japan
B00004S876|3.0|This review focuses mainly on the 5.1 SACD surround mix and should be accepted that way.    For those who may be unfamiliar with this discs music, let me explain my rating. This album is pretty uneven, containing 2 five star songs (Rosanna, Africa), 2 four star songs (Make Believe, I Won't Hold You Back), 1 three star song (Afriad of Love), 1 one star song (Waiting For Your Love), and 4 two star songs.     Now five out of ten is pretty good and, wanting to be as fair as I could, I took my ratings and divided by ten which gives an average of three stars. Although the talented Elliot Sheiner did the 5.1 mix, some of these songs are just poor to bad and difficult to make interesting no matter HOW you mix them. That being the case, my reviews of the 5.1 mixes basically mirror the music, so three stars is what I'll give it.    Ignoring some of the glowing reviews below, I sought out negative reviews before I purchased this (now) hard-to-find disc, and found some from high fidelity audiophile websites. Knowing both sides, I purchased the disc and I found it worth my money (with employee discount) ONLY becuase I REALLY enjoy the good songs, and the 5.1 mix was reasonably revealing. If you really enjoy at least half the songs on this disc, check out the 5.1 version. Mr. Sheiner's mixing is fine and reveals some new little wrinkles you may have missed in the stereo mix. Audiophile sites mentioned that the mixing was a bit uneven and/or random on this. My question is how do you mix a bland piece of crap like Waiting For Your Love in the same way as a gem like Africa? Consistency in the surround mixing is, in this case, a moot point, since some of the songs just stink and cannot be enlivened by a different mix. As one of my audio teachers noted, \\"You can't polish a turd!\\"    Don't get me wrong! These guys were all seasoned session musicians and when they had the right material, they ROCK! The 5.1 mix reveals this, as well, and you will enjoy hearing how each member of the bandfits their piece of the puzzle in to make a few of these songs lasting greats!     Go in knowing that not every song is good! If you can accept that and still want to purchase it, you will definitely enjoy the listen! Please note, as well, that these SACDs have all but disappeared and if you get the chance to buy one, do it before they're gone! I didn't see one for over a year and felt lucky to get the chance!
B00026W82U|3.0|I greatly enjoyed the Kings' debut album, _Quiet is the New Loud_.  That album featured songs that were intimate and introspective, yet memorable and well-developed.  In contrast, the songs on _Riot on an Empty Street_ seem more fragmented.  I suspect that this is merely a sophomore slump, and that we'll have more to look forward to from this unique duo in the future.
B000000OR9|5.0|I have owned the Blue Murder CD since its debut in 1989 and it is still one of the greatest rock recordings I have ever heard. People may not realize that the guitar playing and writing behind the sound and style of the multi-platinum Whitesnake '87 album was in fact guitarist John Sykes. But Sykes was inexplicably fired by singer David Coverdale before the band made a single video or toured in support of the album. Because of this, many fans think that Adrian Vandenberg and Vivian Campbell are the guitarists on the album but this is not the case. If you liked Whitesnake then Blue Murder is an even greater representation of that signature sound and guitarist John Sykes' amazing chops. If his guitar playing wasn't enough, Sykes will knock your socks off as Blue Murder's lead vocalist as well. With Tony Franklin's (the Firm) growling fretless bass and Carmine Appice's (Vanilla Fudge, Rod Stewart) thundering drums, Blue Murder was one of the best all-star rock bands of its era. It is a shame that the record label did not promote this CD as it did Whitesnake because it should have been at the top of the charts. This is not just another hair band of the 1980's. If you love wall to wall guitar, this CD is for you!
B000683VI4|5.0|LOVED this movie. it really got to both of us. U definitely need <br />to have kleenex handy. james garner most definitely should get an OSCAR for his performance in this movie.
B000683VI4|5.0|I have to say I have never ever cried in a romance before \\"the Notebook\\" But i have to say that it is that best movie ever. It will have you crying.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist has a long-standing legend as one of the best horror films ever made.  The movie is one of the best adaptations of a novel that I've seen.  The items left out of the movie didn't really add to the story, but were effective in providing suspense and scary mental imagery without the benefit of film effects.  If you liked the original exorcist, I would recommend Exorcist: The beginning.  Although not quite as scary as the first and uses CGI effects to achieve scares, it is a better attempt at the original than Exorcist II.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|I like this movie, but the plot i don't think was as focused on as other things were. They made the characters and action sequences look like they came out of the comics, very well done on that. Acting is better, more character depth, which was highly needed. Great comedy, which is needed, a little humor calms people down after suspense scenes. This is definitely one of Bryan Singers best. The only problem besides plot, was the speed of the movie, even though a very long movie, scenes move way too fast. The movie is almost at race car speed, especially during action scenes. Overall, very good, definitely one of the best marvel movies, but for X3, plot work would be nice, because if they can keep the formula from this and then add a great plot, X3 will definitely be a classic.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As a Japanese who studied and worked in Europe for several years and has a critical view about Japan, I was completely disgusted by this movie.  It made me laugh to hear the script of this movie got an Academy Award!  One can know the level of this award.  This movie is so boring, filled with racism and ignorance!  What's the percentage of American who can speak perfect Japanese (well, gee, more than 10 words in Japanese)?  What about Spanish or French?  The main characters do not try one word of Japanese to communicate with people, do not respect people struggling to speak with an arrogant foreigner who makes no effort to really commnunicate with them, and all the Japanese appeared in this movie looked unrealistically stupid and dehumanized.  Imagine if Japanese made a similar movie in NY or LA... what would you call this movie?  Not many American know that their arrogance and ignorance observed in this film sicken so many people in so many countries in the world - even UK or Australia!  It is time to wake up, American!!
B000006TRV|5.0|For all you Syd loving, Waters hating retro closed minded people, you are ignorant. Pink Floyd made their best music with Waters at the helm, not Syd. (yes I have listened to Piper, blah blah). The Wall, like many others have said is a concept album.  Don't expect to pick this up and have a radio single for every track.  Even though there are a few (Comfortably Numb, Hey You, Another Brick in the Wall Pt2)  It is best listened to straight through as you probably already know. Anyone who appreciates music should have this in their collection.
B000683VI4|4.0|A story of young love that ends early but is never forgotten.  Set in North Carolina,the story of Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton is brought to life by an older man reading from a notebook to a woman suffering from Alzheimer's.<br /><br />I found Ryan Gosling to be excellent with his performance as Noah Calhoun.  Gosling usually plays dark,intense characters but his intensity shows through in his conviction of the love he feels for Allie played by Rachel McAdams.  While Gosling was perfection,I found McAdams performance to be only alright.  I don't know if it was how the character of Allie was written or if it was because I only see McAdams as Regina from Mean Girls.<br /><br />I also couldn't help but compare the movie to the book.  While Noah in the book was quiet,contemplative,and just an all around dreamer,Gosling's character seemed to be more rough around the edges.<br /><br />I was really excited when I found out that this was being made into a movie.  I wanted to see how the book paralleled the movie.  While the film is really good, I just liked the book way better. I recommend this film but read the book first.
B000002HHB|5.0|It's true that this is a CD to listen to when you're feeling introspective.  It's become a sweet part of my life.
B000002B30|5.0|Some songs have been omitted, but these are undeniably his best.  This CD has rockers, Born to Run, Born in the USA, soft ballads, streets of Philadelphia, My Hometown, it has everything, his best work.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|How can you pinpoint an underground classic movie?  Is it something you feel in your bones, or is something that grows with time?  \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" struck me right away as an understated, over-the-top, stupid-genius, sympathetic and empathetic look at small town life.<br /><br />Some of my friends say it's a dumb movie.  I think they missed the point.  I think someone had a lot of courage to write this script and think they could pull it off.  I can just imagine the pitch that was made to movie execs in three-piece suits...<br /><br />\\"You see, we're going to follow the pathetic lives of three apathetic, fringe, high-school losers, and we're going to set it in rural Idaho, and we're going to turn it into a feel-good tale about love and friendship and diamonds-in-the-rough.\\"<br /><br />An exec furrows his brow at the thought that the movie will have no established stars, and he asks: \\"Why are you trying to sell us such a ridiculous idea?\\"<br /><br />\\"Gawwwsh!\\" the director says.  \\"Because we can do whatever we want to.\\"<br /><br />\\"Do you know who you're talking to?  I could make or break you!\\"<br /><br />\\"Yeah?  Well, who's the only one here who knows illegal ninja moves from the government?\\"<br /><br />I, for one, am glad that some suit caved in and ignored the wisdom of the Hollywood gurus.  This is a classic.  I knew it right away, and I think time will prove me right.
B000001ELP|1.0|What is this [...] This album is horrible! I love Kiss so don't think I'm one of those Kiss Haters but this album is just plain bad. It's hard to imagine the same band that gave us great albums like Destroyer, Rock'N'Roll Over, and Love Gun could put out something this terrible. Ace Frehley bailed on the band because he didn't want anything to do with this album.  It's in my collection but I never listen to it.
B000002IST|1.0|No comments really.This album is a total waste of time and money..it should have been called WE CAN'T BE BOTHERED ANYMORE..!And to think that everyone thought this was cool back in 1991.ouch.A really sad way to end a rather inspired career. <br /> <br />
B000050HTO|4.0|This CD is essential for a down-the-highway road trip.  It's a bit pricey in the stores, so buy it on-line. Also, while everyone is entitled to their opinion on matters of music, the review below by Gaz Lowrab \\"Open Heart\\" has a factual mistake. \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" was originally written by Dylan, not the Byrds. The Byrds arranged it differently and made it a No. 1 in 1965.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I have gotten a chance to hear simple plans new cd, and it is awesome, but they sing alot of depressing songs tho.  All in all a great cd.
B0006399FS|1.0|sure, it's a throwaway, and i mostly agree with all the negative reviews of this disappointing CD -- but just one thought to all who said U2 should quit -- that's been said about alot of great bands who've made bad albums over the years -- and quite a few of them proved that they weren't through yet (rolling stones, to name just one) -- so i think that U2 might just have a great comeback in them, somewhere down the line -- don't be surprised...

6305692572|3.0|I looked through a bunch of the reviews posted here and none of the ones I saw mentioned the actual DVD itself. I agree, the movie is outstanding. I would give the movie a 5 rating. But the DVD is not worth even the low price tag! I give the DVD about a 2 rating. The video quality is horrible with lots of artifacting throughout. Come on Hollywood, we all know you can do better than this! I see the quality of this type of release the equivelent of releasing a movie on VHS is EP or SLP mode! Why sacrifice the quality if you don't have to? Maybe it's so a second, and perhaps third version of the film can be released on DVD in a \\"remastered\\" version over and over and over...  Don't buy this disc. Just wait for a quality release to come out...complete with 5.1 audio. Consumers need to start demanding better or the studios will continue to trick us into buying the same movie over and over and over.
B00068IOWC|1.0|This is an especially annoying time for me, given I'm a die-hard U2 fan ( Unlike what some brianwashed 5 stars posers say, we ARE U2 fans, no matter they can't accept that ).  <br />U2 have become a pseudo-political band whom ultimately gave in to smart business sense.  <br /> <br />\\"we have to treat Africa better, it's got a big muslim population, those fanatics will launch more attacks on the world\\" - Bono...I mean, George Bush...  <br /> <br />They won 3 Grammys for one of the worst music compositions ever: 'Vertigo'.  <br /> <br />An annoying 3 minute iPod commercial, filled with repetitive Edge's trademarks guitars in an attempt to mask a truly pathetic absence of melodic ideas, and Bono's sunglasses, screaming close-ups and strained voice, plus childish, filler and meaningless lyrics, flat and predictable 'music' and even worse video. With that whorish attempt at a radio hit U2 won 3 Grammys. Well, after all, Milli Vanilli won their Grammy as well...  <br /> <br />Bono-the public face of U2-has a genius for cognitive dissonance. He is the upstairs, downstairs king of rock: He simultaneously inflates himself into the most grandiose, arrogant, self-righteous rock star and deflates himself with self-mockery and modesty.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Okay, I listen to all rock.  That might be a bold statement, but I'm dead serious.  Everything from the Beatles to Bruce Springsteen to GnR to Thursday.  From Dillinger Escape Plan to Mars Volta to Jimmy Eat World to Radiohead...yeah, you catch my drift.  Well, the Amazon review took the words right out of my mouth - \\"Guilty pleasure\\".  When I first started seeing \\"Take Me Out\\" getting mass amounts of TV and radio play, I was just like \\"wtf?\\" <br /> <br />Yeah, well, it started to grow on me so I went out and bought the album.  Now, the first time around, I entered this album assuming these guys were just another generic retro-revival attempt and that's exactly what I got. <br /> <br />But wait!  I went back and started listening to it again just for kicks, and my God, something I can't quite point my finger on makes this album one of the most fun and enjoyable albums I've ever heard.  And what's more, is that they actually take many unoriginal elements and make it sound...well...original!  I don't understand what the hot fuss is about the Killers, or why everybody digs the bland antics of Interpol, or why any of these boring 80's rebirth bands are getting so much credit...Franz Ferdinand are the one band that are actually as good as your buddies tell you. <br /> <br />No, in fact, they're better.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|I felt very conflicted about this movie. On the plus side: <br /> <br />The cinematography was decent. The tension and suspense were palpable. The acting was excellent. the plot twists were mesmerizing. So why only 2 stars? <br /> <br />The whole plot of this movie was that the main character suffered an accident that leaves him unable to create new memories after the murder of his wife. So he goes around taking snapshots of everything and tatooing notes on himself so that he can \\"remember\\" clues he finds while trying to solve and vindicate his wife's murder. Every time he meets someone new he tells them about his memory problem and that he won't remember them the next time. So you never know if he can trust the people around him or not. <br /> <br />Sounds good right? But think about it- it doesn't make sense. If he's unable to make new memories since the accident then how does he remember the fact that he had an accident and that he has this memory disorder? These would have to have been facts he accquired after the accident. Hmmm. How does he even remember that his wife was murdered in the first place?  <br /> <br />So this movie, though well shot and well acted, leaves me cold because of a plot hole so huge you could drive a mack-truck through it.

B000683VI4|5.0|How could you not love this movie? It has the typical chick flick love story plus explosions for the guys. This movie is definately the best love story of all times. It makes you want the same kind of love that Allie and Noah have. If only it could happen in real life.
B000055ZDT|5.0|This CD is so heavy...  I was barely able to carry it from the music store to my car.  The weight of first getting ahold of it nearly threw my shoulders out of socket.  Once I was finally able to get it to my car, I thought everything would be okay...  until my car collapsed under the weight.  The CD was too heavy...  my car couldn't support it.  Unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover that sort of situation, so I'm majorly screwed.    This album is messing up my speakers.  I'm not kidding.  This music grinds like none other.  I'm going to admit something here...  with music this heavy, you play it loud, right?...  right...  and this sounds SO GREAT loud...  but...  certain parts of certain songs...  just get so damn heavy, I just can't take it anymore and I have to turn it down just a tad for a short period, and then turn it back up when I recover.  The first paragraph of this review was a joke.  This paragraph isn't.  I am 100% serious.    I don't smoke weed anymore, but this album is making me seriously consider starting again.  I nearly get high just listening to it.  When I was first sampling Electric Wizard - Dopethrone, I was a bit apprehensive about the vocals...  usually with music of this nature, there are either guttural growls or piercing screams...  but the vocals here are different in that I would compare them to Chino Moreno (Deftones vocalist) when he is not singing in his \\"soft\\" voice, but not outright \\"screaming\\" either...  if you have Deftones - Around the Fur, put the disc in and put it on \\"Dai the Flu\\"...  and when Chino starts singing the lines, \\"What's surprise I was right here going off and going on,\\" toward the end of the song, the singing style AND the effects that are added onto a lot of Chino's vocals is what Electric Wizard's vocalist Jus Oborn sounds like.  And surprisingly, it didn't take much getting used to at all to come to the conclusion that it works really well.  I LOVE the vocals.  I am now of the opinion that it totally fits this music.    I won't even start on the guitars.  They are just too heavy.  Seriously.  The resonating distortion just doesn't end, along with the exagerrated grind and deathly low subsonic notes.  If you were to turn the bass setting all the way down, Electric Wizard - Dopethrone would STILL sound more booming than 90% of other music with the bass turned all the way up.  I would propose to these guitars, but I don't think you can legally marry inane objects or the sound waves they produce.    I wouldn't even call this \\"doom\\" metal...  this is...  *scratches head*...  I would describe this, as \\"AENLTT doom\\"...  and that stands for, \\"Anyone-else-not-listening-to-this doom,\\" because anyone else not listening to it, is doomed...  because when you see them, you kick their ass for not listening to it.    I rest my case.
B000002GW5|5.0|I've had a copy of this recording, either on vinyl or CD, since 1981.<br /><br />Without question, several times every summer since then, (usually in the evening as the sun is setting), this CD is played. And, I reminisce. There is an air of old time Rock 'n' Roll that just creates a mood of friendship and belonging. In some ways, this CD is the epitome of Rock 'n' Roll. It's fun; it's meaningful; it's pure.<br /><br />There is not one bad song on this recording. It's beautifully arranged. Each song builds off the previous until the classic, \\"Stay.\\"<br /><br />A music collection would be empty without this CD.
B000002LBH|5.0|Louder than bombs is one of the best arranged albums ever and in total a very enjoyable listening experience.  Morrissey and Marr together made an incredible songwriting team and \\"Louder than Bombs\\" showcases some of their best material.  This is an essential album of  the Smiths and one of the necessary recordings for any complete '80's brit-pop collection.   I bought this album just last year and wonder why I had waited so long.  Don't make the mistake I did: get this one soon. <br /> <br />Starting out with the poppy \\"Is it Really so Strange\\" and \\"Sheila Take a Bow\\" the album moves quickly into more morose and emotive music that the smiths are so well known for. While \\"Shoplifters of the World\\" is a great song, it takes a few listens to become get under your skin.  The next highlight is \\"Half a Person\\"  which is a favorite of mine.  It is sad and sweet and will play on in your head forcing you back to this CD again and again.  This is one of those songs that you think about often.   <br /> <br />The next few songs are all decent and of course \\"Panic\\" (Hang the DJ) is memorable but my next favorite is \\"You Just Haven't Earned it yet Baby\\".  This song is very well written and in spite of its total lack of lyrical substance it has an energy that more than makes up for its poetical deficiency.  Another interesting arrangement is how this track is followed up by \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\".  This track is too one of the best on the album.  After this there are a few nice tracks but the last two tracks really sum up the album mixing happiness and misery.  \\"Hand in Glove\\" is of course one of the top 5 Smiths tracks and it being followed by \\"Stretch out and Wait\\" provides the listener with the pathos needed to appreciate the former song. <br /> <br />Yes I love this album, it has all of the essential ingredients for a great album.  While Morrissey still has some creative force, I believe it is his work with the Smiths that he is best remembered for.  This isn't a period piece: The album is still very playable and younger audiences can appreciate it.  I was 13 when this album came out and I was a fan of the band then.  Now when I play this for my younger friends they appreciate it as well.  This is one essential album and is not one that will sit around on you shelf. A definite buy... <br /> <br />-- Ted Murena
0670033375|3.0|This vast, complex and provocative book eloquently outlines the flip side of California mythology;  eight years ago Diamond said societies succeed by good luck, now he says collapse is due to environmental failures.<br /><br /> His example of the Chaco Culture typifies his conclusions;  he assumes it was the home of thousands, whereas recent theory says only a handful of people lived there.  Instead, Chaco was the site of shrines, just as the Vatican is the site of shrines and not a vast housing complex. People went to Chaco, observed their rites, smashed the pottery jars they brought and went home.  Collapse came with the arrival of the kachina religion, and new technologies which helped the puebloans move to river sites where they live to this day.<br /><br /> Californians have long thought of themselves as 25 years ahead of mankind;  it's a flattering self-image, but one of folly that is the basis for this book.  First, California is too small to be a pattern for the future of mankind;  second, Californians are too unimaginative to be anything but a miner's canary for more sensible peoples; third, any economic or social ripples from the collapse of California won't spread much further than Arizona.<br /><br /> He cites Chaco is an example, and Easter Island.  He looks for the faults, ignoring the fact there is always a logical rationale when people do wrong.  What did the person who cut down the last tree in Easter Island think?  They likely thought, with all due respect to current US policies, they were saving their society.  Californians, and Diamond, may think they are saving modern America with his analysis.<br /><br /> It's a noble idea, but it's wrong because it ignores the human capacity to adapt.  Europe did not thrive after the last ice age due to any innate superiority of its inhabitants;  success was due to a wide range of unique circumstances.  The trend today is to seek one \\"magic bullet\\" to explain complex situations;  ecology is merely the latest of a long line of disasters from which mankiond has escaped by the skin of its teeth.  Success, as always then, now and in the future, is the combination of millions of individual decisions by people who believe they can succeed by their own merits  --  and not by luck.<br /><br /> Many ancient societies collapsed because they were too small;  a disaster, of nature or man-made, overwhelmed a group which had no in depth resources to sustain them.  When Santorini erupted in 1600 BC, it destroyed a variety of \\"great\\" nations that were, in reality, less than the population of many modern suburbs.  The recent Asian tsunami shows the impact of a major disaster on relatively small communities;  but the overall impact on the stricken nations shows none will collapse.  The destruction of Banda Aceh is a tragedy for Banda Aceh, and a hardship for Indonesia, but merely a ripple for Australia and the rest of the world.<br /><br /> California does not represent the future of the world, nor does this book.  In the US, a genuine religious revival similar to that of the Chacoans 900 years ago or even England 200 years ago would completely change the future.  History is not a \\"great man\\" thesis, nor a \\"great idea\\" thesis that was in vogue for much of the last century;  history is the long term wisdom of crowds.<br /><br /> If you believe in California, a culture of excess success and extravagent failure, this is an interesting and even prophetic book.  But if you believe in the incredible complexity of human response to disaster, this book will leave you wanting someone who looks at the wisdom of crowds instead of the folly of individuals.y is merely the latest of a long line of disasters from which mankiond has escaped by the skin of its teeth.

0156421178|5.0|Attracted by the idea of fighting against Fascism, the English journalist, Eric Blair, a.k.a. George Orwell, went to Spain in late 1936 to cover the fight against Fascism and found himself in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia in north-east Spain, joining the militia of the anti-Fascist \\"Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista\\", the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification - or POUM, for short. Yet Orwell himself, in a literary work praised by many for its - or its author's - honesty, admits to have joined without any pretence of knowing or caring what it meant to be part of any particular anti-Fascist militia. His take on all the squabbling, which existed at the time between the various anti-Fascist factions, was much the same as anybody who was ignorant of the facts; that is, \\"Can't we put this political stuff aside and get on with the war?\\" As a result, the consequences of being in the POUM militia - if not a party member himself (which he was not) - would become all too obvious later on when it was almost too late for him personally. <br /> <br />The book is a mixture of a personal, eyewitness account of the fighting on the Aragon Front, in which he participated actively, and of the background to what he called the \\"internecine\\" nature of the infighting between the anti-Fascist factions which was to lead to back-stabbing by rival factions, including the Communists, with the POUM as the main target for attacks in the press, both Spanish and foreign. <br /> <br />Orwell describes life in the front line in language that is meant to convey in an honest - some might say too honest - way just how things were: the ways in which pathetically ill-trained and ill-equipped militiamen were thrown into the front line without even having been shown any weapons of any kind, the privations of life in the trenches, the sheer boredom of being on guard-duty with only the occasional firing from enemy positions, several hundreds of meters away, to break the monotony, the sight of destroyed buildings, the fertile lands being turned into a wasteland, and fear of the cold being greater than fear of the enemy. <br /> <br />For him, the most memorable incidents were the night attack against the Fascist lines, in which he participated, and the moment when he was shot in the throat, albeit at a later date. His descriptions of both incidents are lively and vivid. The crawling through no-man's-land, trying to make as little noise as possible, the firing of shots in unison, the throwing of hand-grenades, the deafening noises, the shouting of attackers and defenders, the bullets zipping overhead too near for comfort, and even Orwell himself chasing a Fascist up a trench trying (and failing) to bayonet him - all are described in language that he keeps as objective as possible, even to the point of regretting trying to kill anyone, even those trying to kill him. <br /> <br />This is due to the fact that people like him were caught up in a war whose political ramifications were either misunderstood or else not understood at all, thanks largely to their being kept deliberately ignorant of the propagandist mud-slinging and governmental back-stabbing behind their backs. The militiamen (Orwell hardly ever uses the word, \\"soldiers\\") only knew that they were fighting, whether by choice (as in Orwell's case) or not, for causes which turned out to be somewhat dubious once one had a grasp of what the war was really supposed to be about. <br /> <br />Orwell devotes a considerable amount of space to trying to explain the political background to all the war, yet he sends a caveat to the reader: \\"Beware of my partisanship\\", indicating that his account is necessarily one-sided, if only because he had been fighting allegedly against Fascism. At times, it can seem utterly confusing to a reader who, like him, knows nothing of the politics prevailing in 1930s' Spain. It seems that, if Franco was not trying to overthrow the Republican government, the various left-wing parties, representing socialism, anarchism and communism, were vying for power in the most brutal manner. <br /> <br />The one thing that was most misunderstood by the foreign press, Orwell notes, was that there was a revolution going on in Spain, yet the Communists allegedly did NOT want revolution to happen, if only because revolution could only come once the war had been won. Instead, the POUM ended up as the political scapegoat, as it was viciously attacked in the press as a subversive organization that was allegedly pro-Fascist, even though the opposite was true. The party was suppressed, and it was a cat-and-mouse game for the wounded Orwell to avoid arrest and detention without trial by the police. His disgust at the way his fellow militiamen were treated is clear - these people had risked their lives at the front yet, once back in Barcelona, they were being thrown into prison. <br /> <br />Orwell neatly puts propaganda and the war into perspective. What Spaniards and foreigners alike wanted to believe depended upon their prejudices being reinforced by whatever was being told in the press, and Orwell quotes many sources which were written in a way designed deliberately to mislead and mis-inform. Even British pro-Communist papers swallowed what Orwell points to as \\"lies\\" spread by the Spanish government in order to ensure that the main reasons for the war in Spain were never fully explained. <br /> <br />It could not have been easy for Orwell, reading about how he and others like him were being portrayed as \\"Trotskyists in Fascist pay\\" when they were, in fact, in the bitterest fighting against the Fascists, yet such was the nature of the contemporary reporting of one of the least understood wars of the 20th century, not least because the politics behind it was badly understood. The attitudes that prevailed in Spain simply did not exist in England, something that Orwell points out, and this state of affairs simply contributed to the indifference to, and lack of understanding of, the war by people in his native England, to which he returned soon after his escape from Spain in June 1937. <br /> <br />Said to be one of the most vivid examples in 20th century English literature of the futility of war and its consequences, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" may be regarded as a combination of a personal memoir and an anti-war polemic, yet it has only been really understood and appreciated properly in the light of events which occurred since the book was first published in 1938. It is, indeed, still a powerful work where Orwell shows that he has the ability to be objective about what was happening, neither attacking nor defending the events around him, the hallmark of a true journalist. <br />
B00003CXD0|5.0|I had the good fortune of revisiting this film recently and I had forgotten a lot of the detail.<br /><br /> Suffice to say it is a water tight and flawless script, the pace of comedy and emerging anxst is perfectly timed.<br /><br /> The story involves Hoffman as a good but \\"difficult\\" actor, struggling to find work and love in the Big Apple. His success rate at both tasks is becoming evermore elusive and impossible. After a disaster of a Birthday Party in which his dilemmas are acutely focussed, he consoles himself by helping a struggling female friend and actor, to prepare for an audition; the part of a hospital soap matriarch.<br /><br /> When the friend fails to get the part the idea to try himself as herself emerges. Truly brilliant themes are comedically explored, sexual politics, self identity and exploration and the equality of the difficulties of being either male or female emerge. Made all the more powerful by it's lead performances, Hoffman and Lang are outstanding, the film is also strengthened by having being made in the 80's; the ultimate sexual politics era! A must see, you'll miss \\"Dorothy\\" just like Lang does!

But listen, everybody. I've just had a funny thought...\\" <br /> <br />     This magical sequel picks up where Charlie and the Chocolate Factory left off, with Charlie bursting through the top of the Wonka factory in a flying glass elevator. After a quick stop to pick up Charlie's family, they fly off into space, eventually finding themselves in conflict with the White House and with a race of hungry space aliens.  <br /> <br />     This book is not quite as grounded as the first one; since it starts off flying around in an elevator, we know right off that this won't be a very realistic tale. But Dahl really pours on the humor and the thrills, which keeps us turning the pages as quickly as we can.  <br /> <br />     We return to more familiar ground later in the book, when Charlie's family returns to the chocolate factory and find it to be every bit as thrilling and dangerous as their encounters in space.  <br /> <br />     I believe that this is the only sequel Dahl ever wrote, and I wish all sequels were as good as this one. On the one hand, he does seem to fall a bit into the trap of making things bigger and better in the hopes that it will make up for the sheer originality of the first book. On the other hand, the book is far more bizarre than the first one, and at times takes on an eerie surreality akin to The Phantom Tollbooth.  <br /> <br />     It's hard to find a more entertaining character than Willy Wonka, who is fiercely cheerful and unpardonably rude, but always to those who deserve it. It's not many characters who can seemingly take pleasure from the act of annoying a trio of bedridden octagenarians and come out of it with more goodwill than he went in with.  <br /> <br />     Dahl has a talent for children's books unlike any other author. That talent is on full display here, and this book is as highly recommended as his other works.  <br />

B0000062Y2|2.0|I'd first seen this movie on the 2004 DVD version. The sound was clear and full but this 2 CD soundtrack of that film sounds vastly inferior in terms of sound quality. I might as well had just created my own CDs from the DVD soundtrack. Which is a shame because alot of the orchestrations here are more dramatic than in the 1970 concept album. It sounds awful. Drums that you thought were there sound almost non existent. During Hosanna the strings sound filtered; as though someone had used those programs used to clean up LP noise to excess. On the \\"Simon Zealotes\\" track you can barely hear the chorus. It literally sounds like they are singing it in the apartment below me. Imagine a poor quality mp3 sound. Muffled and half baked. The previous CD release is just as bad. I managed to get a copy of it at a used record store in downtown Toronto. Don't believe the reviews that say that the LP sounds better. It may have sounded better to them because their record player emitted more treble than their CD player or something but I purchased the LP version on ebay which was in like new condition with virtually no scratces. But still the LP suffered the same mixing and filtering problems. Same Simon Zealotes chorus problem, same problem with the chorus/strings in Hosanna, in the Trial Before Pilate the treble suddenly shoots up in the exact same place. I'm thinking that they are using the same, poorly mixed, master tape for all of the releases of the JCSS movie soundtrack. Unless MCA puts together a well mixed version of the soundtrack one must resort to either the DVD or the concept recording. Which is bit of a drag because although the concept recording sounds great and singers are probably the best, the movie soundtrack has some impressive orchestrations the concept recording doesn't have. The DVD, although sounding much clearer than the soundtracks, still has it's faults. In Heaven On Their Minds on the DVD the vocal track is very loud while the instrumentals are hard to hear.<br /><br />Anyway, the singers are great tho. Neeley makes for a weak Jesus at points but at other times, like during Gethsemane, he blows you away. Elliman is by far her weakest in this version. She was great in the concept album. Here she swings too much from note to note. Anderson's Judas is breathtaking. Murray Head (concept), Carl Anderson (movie), Ben Vereen (broadway) are all equally great but in slightly different ways. Ben Vereen has a commanding and powerful Motown style. Anderson was less pop and a little more emotive and Head's Judas was very rock..    Anyway, the singers are great tho.

0802130208|5.0|Synopsis <br /> <br />A monument of sloth, rant and contempt, a behemoth of fat, flatulence and furious suspicion of anything modern - this is Ignatius J Reilly of New Orleans, noble crusader against a world of dunces. In magnificent revolt against the twentieth century, Ignatius propels his monstrous bulk among the flesh posts of the fallen city, documenting life on his Big Chief tablets as he goes, until his maroon-haired mother decrees that Ignatius must work. <br />First lines <br /> <br />A Confederacy of Dunces is a novel written by John Kennedy Toole, but not published during his lifetime. Through the efforts of the writer Walker Percy and Toole's mother, the book was published in 1980; it quickly became a cult classic and won a Pulitzer Prize a year later. <br /> <br />The title is a reference to a saying by the classic master of satire, Jonathan Swift: \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" (Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting) <br /> <br />The story is set in New Orleans, Louisiana at the start of the 1960s. The central character is Ignatius J. Reilly, an intelligent but slothful man still living with his mother in Uptown New Orleans who, because of family circumstances, must set out to get a job for the first time in his life at age thirty. In his quest for employment he has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters. <br /> <br />Major characters <br /> <br /> <br />Ignatius J. Reilly <br /> <br />Ignatius is something of a modern Don Quixote - eccentric and creative, sometimes perhaps to the point of being delusional. He tries to find jobs requiring little or no work which will allow him at the same time to further his plans to somehow achieve greatness. <br /> <br />He disdains modern civilization, especially pop culture, but gets a perverse delight in immersing himself in order to mock its vapidity and express his outrage with its lackof philosophy and geometry. He prefers the enlightened philosophy of the Middle Ages, especially that of Boethius. <br /> <br /> <br />Myrna Minkoff <br /> <br />Myrna \\"The Minx\\" is a beatnik Jew from New York City whom Ignatius met while she was in college in New Orleans. Their political, social, religious, and personal orientations could hardly be more different, but Myrna and Ignatius have a fascination with each other. For most of the novel she is seen only in the regular correspondence which the two keep up since her return to New York. Officially, they both deplore everything the other stands for. Though probably neither of them would admit it, their correspondence indicates that, though separated by half a continent, many of their actions are done with hopes to impress the other. <br /> <br />Irene Reilly <br /> <br />Mrs. Reilly is Ignatius's long-widowed mother. She still thinks of Ignatius as an adolescent, encouraging him to think of himself that way. She is fond of drinking cheap wine and is generally tipsy. <br /> <br /> <br />FOr once these critics were spot on!     <br /> <br />Published reviews <br /> <br />A masterwork of comedy ... A dozen characters bounce off each other, physically and verbally, through a plot of such disarming inventiveness that it seems to generate itself effortlessly ... A pungent work of slapstick, satire and intellectual incongruities ... it is nothing less than a grand comic fugue. <br />The New York Times <br /> <br />Witty, exuberant and addictive, a mocking eulogy of life in New Orleans by a modern Rabelais. <br />The Times <br /> <br />If a book's price is measured against the laughs it provokes, A Confederacy of Dunces is the bargain of the year. <br />Time <br /> <br />The hero of John Kennedy Toole's incomparable comic classic is one Ignatius J. Reilly, \\"huge, obese, fractious, fastidious, a latter-day Gargantua, a Don Quixote of the French Quarter. His story bursts with wholly original characters, denizens of New Orleans' lower depths, incredible true-to-life dialogue, and the zaniest series of high and low comic adventures.\\" -- <br />Henry Kisor in the Chicago Sun-Times <br /> <br />An astonishingly good novel, radiant with intelligence and artful high comedy. <br />Newsweek <br /> <br />A brilliant and evocative novel. <br />San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br />A gem-one of the funniest books ever written. <br />New Republic
B0006399FS|1.0|...To stay relevant, the band has retreated musically by making the two most conservative, radio-directed albums of its career, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" (2001) and \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" (2004). It's no coincidence that the garage-rock-by-numbers \\"Vertigo\\" was rising on the pop charts as the single from \\"Atomic Bomb\\" in the same week that bassist Adam Clayton told Time magazine: \\"If our goal is still to be the biggest band in the world, the new record had to have three or four songs that would bring in new people. Three or four hits.\\" <br /> <br />U2's struggle to stay young is typical of many rock bands who manage to survive into their third decade. \\"At a certain point, you have to ask yourself are the kids still getting you, and are you still getting them? And when does that stop to matter,\\" says guitarist Peter Buck of R.E.M., a band that ran neck-and-neck with U2 for more than a decade in terms of critical acclaim and approached it in album sales before its profile began to drop.Consider U2 in a nutshell: having marched to the top of Reagan's era with anthemic rock climaxed by The Joshua Tree, they shifted toward internationalist tendencies with 1991's Achtung Baby.  <br /> <br />Their interesting - if occasionally belaboured - experiment in postmodern iconography (Zooropa, Pop) eventually alienated U.S. fans and critics (\\"irony-ensconced rock'n'roll Liberace,\\" wrote Salon.com). Uh-oh.  <br />Realizing they were starting to get a little long in the tooth - average age 40.5 - they decided to make one last killing: All That You Can't Leave Behind, safe as milk. Voil?: it's a Beautiful Day (\\"Don't let it get away\\"), as bland and unprovocative as NSYNC.  <br /> <br />Later touring with something called Elevation - post-irony earnestness, or cynical put-on? - the Irishmen became America's band.  <br />Ten million copies and eight Grammy nominations later, and hey dude, U2's invited to America's ultimate keg party, the Super Bowl. Bono hypes: \\"We are here to bring peace to Brady and Bledsoe, to bring peace to the AFL and NFL.\\" Beavis or Butt-head couldn't have said it any dumber.  <br /> <br />On a heart-shaped stage - first rock band featured as a solo act at a Super Bowl halftime! - there's Bono braying a creepy New Age mantra: \\"What you don't have, you don't need it now.\\" Try telling that to the hungry, homeless and infirm, or those Enron suckers suddenly out of jobs and pensions.  <br /> <br />There's Bono wailing Where the Streets Have No Name, backed by a list of U.S. Sept. 11 victims' names scrolling upward in alphabetical order. Then the cathartic moment: Bono, lump in throat, opened his black jacket to reveal a Stars and Stripes lining. (Did he buy the thing off the Internet?)  <br /> <br />This gesture cemented his status as Honorary American, free, free at last to join the nauseatingly long list of 9/11 profiteers.  <br />It's cool to co-opt and sell out. Indeed, the flimflam that passed as the U.S. economy over the last decade - call it a shell game lining the pockets of a few at the expense of everyone else - was hyped as a 1960s-styled \\"people's revolution\\" (a scam scabrously and presciently chronicled in Thomas Frank's superb screed One Market Under God).  <br /> <br />Bono knows the lesson: Davos tycoons rule!  <br />But corporate sounds - and the message of \\"Consume this\\" and \\"Show me the money\\" - turn my stomach.  <br />That means U2, Bono.  <br /> <br />U2 have become the most strategized rock campaign of the music history. On radio \\"Vertigo\\" was an instant hit. This is no surprise--U2 management and representation previewed the tracks to influential broadcast programmers in late summer, with the throwback \\"Vertigo\\" emphasized as the first radio cut. Various program directors then immediately reported their pleasure with the single to the press, essentially declaring it a smash before it ever hit the airwaves. Five weeks after its release, was the No. 1 track on modern rock radio. <br /> <br />Bono is the biggest sellout in the music industry, he claims to be an world activist, but readily accepts corporate dollars any chance he gets (and panders to corporate greed, i.e. an U2 themed iPod). Plus, their music has become so derivative and predictable. In other words...U2 are finished. Period.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00069YE0W|5.0|All of the six albums are great, i noticed many people put them in order, but i think i would be doing an injustice since i have owned  some longer, and therefore may be baised, but i think all are great, not one dissapoints.  <br />I've listened to this over and over, and if i had to pick out stand out tracks, i would say #1)Past Recedes, #9)Hope, and the last one #11) Leap Your Bar.  <br />The only dissapointing thing in all of this IS that this is the final of the series. I hope we see much more!!!  <br />John, if you ever read this, thanks for the great music!!
0385510454|1.0|The books I read most recently by John Grisham were Skipping Christmas and Bleachers.  The first title I found amusing.  But the latter title I thought was a waste of my time. And if I thought it was a waste to me, I wondered why Grisham bothered to write it.  Well, if I felt that way about Bleachers, it is nothing in comparison to the way I felt about The Broker. I will admit that its been some time since I read a Grisham book on the order of what he's been known for, but like falling off a horse and getting back on afterwards, I thought that after a couple of pages I would be on familiar territory.  To be honest, the first few chapters were OK but then it became all too clear that something was very wrong with this book.  And that was, that for a suspense book, there was little suspense.  And if I was really forthright, the book was downright boring. But since I always try to look for the good in all books I will say that one aspcet of this book did spark my interest.  It was the long walks in Bologna, Italy and a bit of information about some of the sights that at least kept my eyes on the page. But in the end, I thought that perhaps Mr. Grisham is applying as a writer for the Fodor guide books or to be a tour leader next summer.<br /><br />I don't want to reiterate what many have already said about this plot but just in case you know little about the theme I offer you this condensed version. A power broker released from jail on a presidential pardon has secrets that can't be revealed.  So at the hands of the US government, the broker is spirited away from prison by the United States governemnt and placed in Italy where he is supposed to go underground.  While news of his pardon reaches the rest of the world, those that have conceived this pardon are hopeful that somebody else will kill him before what he knows can leak out.  Naturally the broker is way too crafty for this to happen.  But by the time he catches on to what may happen to him and is being pursued by many countries, I was already wishing the book would end.  What could have been a really good book like the Robert Ludlum or John LeCarre novels, never got off the ground and when it did, it landed with a flop.  It was at best mediocre and if anybody but John Grisham tried having this published, they'd most likely have the manuscript for wallpaper. In the end I read and read and surely thought that there would be some redeeming value. But all there was, was great relief that this book was finally over and I could move on to another book.untries, I was already wishing the book would end.

B000002J09|5.0|This is a CD that you push play on and don't stop listening to it until it's done. The album starts with two of my favorite rock songs, 'Black Dog' and 'Rock and Roll'. 'Stairway to Heaven' casts a tremendous shadow over the rest of the songs, but they all seem to find a place in the sun. From the delightfully odd 'Battle of Evermore' to the lyrical and calming 'Going to Clifornia', this album shines. These eight songs have been around for more than 30 years and i still prefer them over most of the songs today.
0316172324|3.0|I am slightly disappointed with this book. As a reader who really enjoyed Gladwell's previous book 'The Tipping Point' I had looked forward to his new book. In some respects the book is like I hoped it would be: the topic choice is very interesting, the writing style is smooth and entertaining, the many anecdotes are very enjoyable and there are some interesting descriptions of experiments. Anyone should be able to pick up some interesting stories, points, facts and views from this book.<br /><br />What disappoints me though is that the book does not really deliver what it promises. In the introduction chapter the author promises to answer three questions: 1) Can Blink-descisions be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately? 2) When should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them? 3) (how) can our snap judgments and first impressions be educated and controlled? Although the many stories in the book certainly imply clues to answers to these questions, explicit answers to these three questions are not clearly given. In fact, when I finished reading I felt like the author had forgotten to include a concluding and integrating chapter in which he would explicitly answer these questions and summarize and conclude. But that chapter is really missing. Due to that the book really lacks clarity.<br /><br />Although this book is disappointing I won't stop following Gladwell's writings. His previous book was better than this one and I'll bet his next one will be better too.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I watched this movie twice.  The whole time I watched it, I did not laugh.  It was only funny AFTER the movie was over.  That's what I love about this movie.  It is so stupid it's funny.  Yes, I do believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this, but i don't know...i guess just being able to say that I've seen it is pretty cool. <br />WHO THE HECK IS ROGER EBERT?  please email me and tell me who this is because it is really bothering me!

B00005RHGL|5.0|Boy, was Val Kilmer ever robbed. His virtuoso performance as Doc Holliday is infinitely more worthy of an Academy Award than most of those that have got the Oscar. This is ruly an all star cast: Sam Elliot, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane, Dana Delaney . . the list is endless. And they don't even come close to Jason Priestly as \\"sister-boy\\" and Michael Biehn and Powers Booth, the delciously dastardly villains. With so many good actors, you gotta have a great script, and Tombstone is one of the best written (although serious liberties were taken with the facts), directed, edited and filmed movies ever made. Even through the digressions, the story moves along at a nice clip and will keep your attention. The cinematography is really excellent and at times brilliant; lightening occurs naturally and frequently on the desert location where the movie was made, so vivid displays are woven into the film to create atmosphere and mood. The special edition DVD features are great.
0375704027|4.0|I appreciate Murakami's wonderful ability to create such real characters, to whom you become so drawn to. At times, it's difficult to read Toru's real hope to set up house with his first love, but you can always feel that this will be an unrealised hope. Even those characters in Norwegian Wood that you never warm to (and I think most can easily name one in this novel)are necessary for the lessons that Toru learns throughout the novel. <br /> <br />Even though Norwegian Wood is a novel that looks at so many things like loss, unrequited love, relationships, there are many moments filled with humour, hope, and the promise of new beginnings. <br /> <br />Love the J. Rubin translation.  Well done Mr Rubin!
B00001OH7X|3.0|Not as experimental as \\"Heroes\\", his previous album, and not as accessible as the following 'Scary Monsters', 'Lodger' tends to be forgotten nowadays, which is okay; everything is forgotten eventually, might as well get it over with quickly. Only the other day I realised that I had forgotten David Lynch, the film director, who was huge in the early 1990s. Lodger's first side is very weak, and it's a shame that the current version of the CD doesn't have the bonus tracks that came out a while back, but hey. I realise now that I had also forgotten Laura Dern. She's old now. It's easy to see that a bunch of early-80s acts had this album, specifically Gary Numan, Ultravox and the like, although Lodger has very few synths. <br /> <br />Lodger has a slick, early-80s production which thankfully does not extend to synth drums, although there is what sounds like fretless bass on a few tracks. The top standout is 'Look Back in Anger', which is excellent, and was accompanied with an equally-good extended version on the previous release of the album, now gone. The other bonus track was 'I Pray, Ole', a terrible title which was nonetheless a catchy little song. 'Boys Keep Swinging' is the one they play on television, and it's fun but fairly trivial; 'DJ' has oblique lyrics which have nothing to do with dinner jackets at all (\\"he used to be my boss, and here he is a puppet dancer!\\" is a good line). 'Repetition' is a throw-back to the paranoid, edgy songs that were on 'Low', specifically 'Breaking Glass'; \\"I guess the bruises won't show / if she wears long sleeves\\". 'Red Money' is one of those boring slow songs where you envisage the band nodding their heads and high-fiving in the studio, because musicians love kicking out boring slow jams almost as much as they sicken my stomach. <br /> <br />The first side isn't as good. 'Red Sails' has a nice wispy synth part, but has a terrible 'oriental' melody, whilst both 'African Night Flight' and 'Yassassin' dabble with what would become 'world music' but not very well. 'Fantastic Voyage' sounds like a rewrite of 'Word on a Wing' from 'Station to Station'. 'Move On' is quite good, with what sounds like a backwards vocal solo - there are lots of tricky experimental touches on the album - but it comes and goes, phfft. <br /> <br />That's it, I can stop now.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|The first time I saw this movie i watched it over again because it is so captivating. As you watch it you can't help but be sucked in by the story and the characters. The acting is also amazing. Marlon Wayans showed me he's more then just a crappy comedy actor and all the others were awesome as well. The story just keeps getting worse for all four main characters and their addiction. As it goes along you just know they are heading towards an ultimate climax in which they all reach their ultimate nightmarish lows. It is a very depressing movie and it took me as close to crying from a movie as I've been in a long time. But it's just so well put together and the music in it works so well..you jsut have to see it. It's a can't miss.
0887306667|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and understanding the ideas presented in it. However, it is full of predictions and assumptions that have been proven wrong. Does this mean the \\"laws\\" are invalid? Perhaps. Does it mean the authors are to blame for making predictions based on these \\"laws,\\" that for example, Microsoft will fail to unseat the then-dominant Lotus 1-2-3? Likely.     Then again, some events - like the one above - could merely be the exception. Looking at the laws from a broader point of view, they do make sense. That is, applying them to most companies rather than holding the exceptions as proof at the book is invalid and wrong.    Anyway, I'm sure you will like this book, whether or not you're in marketing. Don't be too critical of the laws and you'll walk away with knowledge you did not have before.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I honestly do believe that U2 laid down their very best music on their back-to-back pair of \\"experimental\\" albums, 1993's \\"Zooropa,\\" and this one, 1997's \\"Pop.\\" Of course I like the band's classic stuff that came before, as well as their excellent music that has come after, but \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\" are definitely my favorites from Bono & the boys. How very strange that many U2 fans simply can't appreciate these two fantastic albums, complaining that the band strayed too far from their trademark sound into odd, far-out musical realms that didn't suit them. Really? Did they really do that? I don't think so. U2 simply wanted to expand their musical horizons a bit and try something a little different. Not *abandon* their sound, but just add some extra, experimental colors to it. Would recording \\"The Joshua Tree Part II\\" or \\"War Part II\\" been a better choice for them? Of course not. I like U2's other music just fine, but \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\" are my favorite U2 albums because they contain, in my opinion, the most exciting, adventurous music the band have ever done. Picking up right where they left off with \\"Zooropa,\\" U2 delivered another album of barnburning music with \\"Pop.\\" Working again with industrial producer Flood, the band totally tear up the place with sizzling, electrifying rock that also incorporates elements of dance and techno, and brilliantly so. How can you NOT like the slammin' rock of \\"Discotheque,\\" the atmospheres of \\"Do You Feel Loved,\\" or the eurotrash exuberance of \\"Mofo\\"? \\"Pop\\" also contains softer numbers like \\"If God Will Send His Angels,\\" \\"Staring At The Sun,\\" and \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress,\\" songs that are just as gorgeous as earlier U2 classics like \\"With Or Without You\\" and \\"One.\\" \\"Last Night On Earth\\" and \\"Gone\\" are both thrilling rockers. \\"Miami\\" is a great industrial confection, while \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is a wonderfully slinky number. \\"Please\\" is one of the most passionate U2 songs I've ever heard, a terrific tune that just builds and builds in power as it goes along. And finally, there's \\"Wake Up Dead Man,\\" an excellent song that sees the band riding away into the sunset, another great album done. Bono's vocals throughout are powerful, the band's performances are nothing less than scorching, and the production work by Flood is mighty impressive. There's no reason for this U2 album to be overlooked, and I hope that the fans who didn't dig it the first time around will give it another chance. \\"Pop\\" is an amazing U2 album.

0385486804|4.0|... I *do* understand why McCandless would walk away from his whole life, society, everything, and go off into the wilderness to see if he could make it on his own. It's a powerful draw for some people. And it's not like he went straight from Suburbia to inner Alaska. He was on his own for two years before that, and for much of those two years he was, really, out in the wilderness, making it on his own. He survived alone in Alaska for several months. He died because he made two mistakes, one small and one large, neither of which would have been fatal separately. <br /> <br />I thought this was a great book. There were a few chapters that dragged (NOT Krakauer's personal stories) but overall, definitely a worthwhile read. It's well-written, well-researched, and compassionate without romaticizing McCandless's foolishness or trying to justify his self-righteousness. It's a terribly sad story, but I think the reviewers who are still angry at the kid after reading it (for his stupidity or whatever) completely missed the point. Or perhaps they just read the first three chapters.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Dirty Dancing is a classic that is absolutely wonderful!  Everything about this movie is perfect in that there is no part that you are not sucked into these people's lives!  I absolutely fell in love with it from the first time I watched it in the 1980's.  I have the original VHS still and had to upgrade to DVD as it would not be right not owning a great movie.  I controversies were a great point...pregnancy being such one.  I also enjoy the forbidden love with Swayze and Grey-as they have great online chemistry.  The movie is set in 1963 so the music and clothes are also great to watch.  I like when Baby stumbles upon the \\"dirty dancing\\" club.  It is great. I like the fact that they don't try and play 1963 as innocent.  Over-all a classic for any fan of the movie back in the late 80's and early 90's.
0316172324|2.0|Great concept, but the book is simply too repetitive.  After the first few chapters, you get the point - gut decisions are about as good as long, thought out decisions.  It would've been a nice magaizine article, but didn't justify an entire book.
B00008AY3L|5.0|This is an AMAZING CD!  I didn't think I would like Ben Harper and a friend let me borrow their CD.  I didn't want to give it back as I liked this CD so much!  It is amazing the music flows with the lyrics; and the music  is groovy with different things done with his voice.  But, it works!  I am amazed at how diverse this CD is also.  It has sounds that everyone will like. My favorite one was Diamonds On the Inside the title track but, after listen to this CD it is amazing.  I love every song and it is in high rotation all the time at my house and in my car and anywhere else I can play it!  This song is for anyone who loves music as I think you will enjoy it.
B00005JMUL|5.0|This is the movie to see this year for children, parents and grandparents like us. We took our 3yr. old granddaughter to see this and she loved it, as we did !! She has talked about nothing else for the past 4 wks and thinks each time we get in the car, we are going to see The Polar Express!! I bought the gift set, book, tape,cd and BELL at Walmart for her for Christmas. Wrapped the bell in a red box just like the movie and you should have seen her eyes on Christmas Eve. That was worth it, right there !!! Can't wait until the dvd comes out... I guess I will have to get 2--- one for my house and one for hers !!
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I have really enjoyed the music of Peter Cincotti on his 2 CDs.  I kept reading in the reviews comparisons to Michael Buble; so I decided to pick up this CD which is my introduction to him.  Buble's \\"It's Time\\" is a sterling effort, ripe with moving vocals.  The opener \\"Feeling Good\\" is stunning with Don Sebesky & David Foster's arrangement bringing to mind Bobby Darin.  \\"A Foggy Day (In London Town)\\" is smooth & swanky.  Of my 4 favorites, 3 are smack dab in the middle of the set.  The Beatles' \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" rocks and sways in ways McCartney probably never imagined.  \\"The More I See You\\" was a favorite of mine with Chris Montez's bossa nova arrangement and his breathy vocals that make Michael Jackson sound masculine.  Buble takes the melody with Christian McBride's marvelous bass thumping the beat and sounds like a man lost in love.  Cyndi Lauper did a treatment of Maurice Williams' \\"Stay\\" on her \\"At Last\\" CD that brings to mind Buble's arrangement of \\"Save the Last Dance for Me.\\"  Both work exquisitely.  I'm utterly delighted with Michael's reading of the Cole Porter classic \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\"  I had thought I'd never another version that rises to the level of Ella Fitzgerald, but here Michael re-crafts the song complete with a little giggle, \\"Why should I try to resist when baby I know so well, I've got U under my skin.\\"  Michael's original \\"Home\\" is a melodic jewel.  This is a very strong outing from this dynamic singer.  Enjoy!
B0001AP12G|5.0|For anyone to even slightly condemn this album, they deserve to listen to a Celine Dion...over...and over...and over again. <br /> <br />  I believe that Kanye West has probably released the best album I've heard in 10 years, no joke. Basically, it shakes awake the rap game, which has been lying so idle due to pop-corn rappers like chingy, nelly, g-unit and even eminem. <br /> <br />  See, unlike almost ALL other albums (whatever genre of music they tailor to), \\"The College Dropout\\" features a playlist that can be listened through all the way till the end, and one will still not find an even remotely bad song. That is the nature of Kanye West, only quality. The skits also add a thoughtful, if not hilarious atmosphere, doing what so many other rappers cannot: insert skits that don't break up the albums progress. Since I cannot feature the whole album as my list for great songs, I will higlight the \\"best\\".*  <br /> <br />Probably my favorite is the amazingly soulful \\"Two Words\\". Mos Def and Freeway co-star with Kanye as they spit the song enitrely in...yep...\\"two words\\". The beat is (go figure) astounding, bringing in melodic violins, a pounding drum beat, and even The Harlem Boys Choir. Absolutely, a classic. <br /> <br />Other noteworthies: \\"We Don't Care\\" is an interesting look into drug trafficking of today. Kanye raps, \\"Ain't no tuition for having no ambition, and ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home/ so we forced to sell crack, rap and get a job...you gotta do something man, your ass is grown!\\". Great beat, especially with the little kids singing along.  <br /> <br />\\"Spaceship\\" Features little known rappers named GLC and Consequence, and talks about wanting to \\"Fly Away\\" from it all: the 9-to-5's, the BS, the sadness of losing a loved one. Very nice. <br /> <br />\\"Never Let Me Down\\" is a collab between Kanye and one of the Godfathers of hip-hop, Jay-Z. This track is absolute fire, with a beautiful, powerful piece of poetry in between their rhymes. Topnotch. <br /> <br />\\"School Spirit Skit 1\\" through \\"Lil Jimmy Skit\\" is both hilarity and thoughtfulness. Lil jimmy states, \\"Do I know what sex is? No I don't no what sex is! But I bet you that I could add up the change in your purse very fast!\\" This is absolutely the funniest skit I've ever heard on any album. He also talks about how, \\"All the other homeless people have newspaper, but guess what I have? Thats right, those degrees\\". On School Spirirt, Kanye opens by rhyming \\"I left school and I started my own business/ They said 'Oh, you graduated?' Naw, I decided I was finished/ Chasing yall dreams and what you got planned/ Now I spit it so hot you got tanned\\"     <br /> <br />18 (\\"Through the Wire\\"), 19 (\\"Family Business\\") and 20 (\\"Last Call\\") are all great songs as well, especially \\"Last call\\". I enjoyed listening to Kanye talk about how he got to the Roc.  <br /> <br />All in all, this album is one of those classics that, in 10 years, could be remembered in such reverence as albums like \\"Illmatic\\" are viewed now. Kanye West is a much needed slap, no, K.O to the rap industry, proving that it doesn't always have to be about \\"guns, money, hoes, repeat\\". And even if it is, you gotta keep it real.   <br /> <br />PEACE <br /> <br />* If you're wondering why I didn't put all the hits of this year, like \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"All Falls down\\", its not saying that they aren't great songs, its because I wanted people to see the whole picture. Oh, and by the way, Kanye got robbed in the Grammys. Ok, Ray Charles was an amazing preformer, but you can't help but wonder if this sucess is becuase audiences actually like his music, or are spurred to vote for him because \\"Ray\\" (The Movie), OR because they want to pay him respect for his death. I believe that Ray would've thought, \\"I'm dead, so why shouldn't the younger preformers win, instead of me. It doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm in heaven.\\" But no....Oh well, Kanye DID win best Rap Album and Best Rap Song, so congrats Kanye, youearned it (and more)!

B000683VI4|5.0|I do not like ratings that tell you the entire story.  What's the point of watching the movie after someone has already laid it all out for you?  So my ratings will not tell you every detail in this story.  Instead I want you to know this is the best love story ever. <br /> <br />This couple knew great passion.  That is what held them together until the end.  By the last 10 ten minutes of this movie you feel their passion, and their pain.  That is when the kleenex comes in.  I found myself crying uncontrollably.  That is the secret.  THIS MOVIE MAKES YOU FEEL.
0380715430|4.0|Am I the only person who is amazed at the range and gravity of errors that diligent reviewers have discovered in this book? Inuit snow (they don't have fifty words for it); Finnish swearing (they do); Japanese orthography (I didn't get that one) ... the list goes on. I'll tell you a real shocker: I knew a journalist, a graduate in English, who thought that the language he majored in and professed to write descended largely from Welsh (certain Celtic and Latin dialects spoken in Britain at the end of the Roman Empire). If that doesn't strike you as risible, you need to read this book. This is not a work of high scholarship but it isn't dumb (or dumm). It's a popular account by an enthusiastic amateur, written with his usual brio, and if it persuades more people to take an interest in their mother tongue, or, at a pinch, their native language, good on it and about time.<br /><br />If you want the full story, study Baugh & Cable's 'History of the English Language' and references there. Bryson's book is more fun, though. I recommend it along with Simeon Potter's 'Our Language', which covers much the same ground but without the swear words.<br /><br />I can pick nits too. In chapter 6 he gets the High German Sound-Shift back to front. In his version, 'water' ought to appear as 'wasser' in Dutch, Frisian and Plattdeutsch (this may be his Wasserloo). Also, he has a tendency to refer to the group in question, including English, as 'north Germanic', which is a big no-no to us nerds. Bottom line: read Potter as well.
0446677450|3.0|My boyfriend brought this concept to my attention after <br />I asked him why he was living way below his income and <br />being a cheap a_ _ on our dates.  He said he was trying <br />to be \\"smart\\" with his money.  It is a way to get people <br />to think you are selfish and get them to hate you.  The <br />concepts that this guy presents are interesting, but.. <br />really, how many of you without good credit and no money <br />actually have opportunities to buy investments.  Good <br />investments?  I mean really?  That is fantasy if you ask me. <br />In the real world you have to have \\"some\\" money are good <br />credit in order to buy investments.  Don't you?  My boyfriend <br />has bought into this in hopes of quitting his job.  I think <br />he's lazy and selfish.  I hope he succeeds, but I'm not <br />real hopeful at this point in that or our relationship!
B00006879E|5.0|I love the album...despite what alot of people are saying...perhaps that's because I have more of a love for the music because of my experiences while listening to it moreso than simply the musical composition, which is also great...because I bought the album before the experiences and just fell in love with it more because of the experiences. <br /> <br />My boyfriend lives in Italy but all while he visited me here in Chicago, we listened to Maroon 5 and each song gave us a different mood that we enjoyed.  Don't sleep on \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" because I had to give him one at the airport.  Don't pass up \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Must Get Out\\" because he left on a rainy sunday morning and i wanted so badly to go back to the \\"old country\\" of Italy with him and get out of the big city of Chicago.  Then again...the times we shared together were perfectly spent listening to \\"Secret\\" but even when we fought \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"Under you skin\\" were great also.   <br /> <br />The album is great....just let it play...don't skip any tracks...just let it play

B000002U82|5.0|It says it all, They just know how to do things that make you feel awesome. Listening to this music makes you wanna just explode with sensation. Crank \\"time\\" up as loud as you can and dont tell you you arent astounded or ready to take in all of the world. \\"Breathe\\" has such a refreshing vibe that cleanses any bad baggage that is on you. \\"Any Colour you like\\" just makes you forget any of the negativity around. This is an album you cant get enough of \\"Us and them\\" jumps all over the place in such a powerfull way it takes you out there to the other side. I love Floyd, all around, from \\"Brick in the wall\\" to \\"Shine on you crazy Diamond\\", but this is their best work. It has to be one of the top 3 albums of all time.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Living in Idaho, being from California, and despising Idaho, I was kind of against seeing this movie. But, I saw it on Pay-Per-View and decided to order it to see if it was as good as other people said it was. And as much as I hate to admit it. I did in fact like it. One thing I didn't like was the guy who played Napoleon's brother Kip. The actor just pissed me off. Anyway, Jon Heder plays Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon is a tad bit socially challenged and lives with his grandma and brother Kip. <br />When his grandma is injured in a motorcycling accident his scheming Uncle Rico moves in. This is a sub plot really, but it spawns some of the funniest jokes in the movie.But anyway, at school he makes friends with Pedro, who later runs for president. This movie actually is pretty stupid. But it's funny and at times heartfelt. It is also annoying to me being from California. There are frequent uses of \\"Idaho\\" words. Like referring to soda as \\"pop\\". Pop is a sound, not a liquid. If you see my point, e-mail me at Moviefreak144@hotmail.com. Anyway funny movie. If not rather annoying. B+. <br />
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie is just a real treasure. It's great for anyone who still loves magic and Peter Pan. Jason Isaacs's performance as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook is, in short, brilliant. His acting with Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) and Rachel Hurd-Wood ( Wendy Darling ) is really just pure magic. Jeremy is a wonderful Peter. With his good looks and golden curls he almost makes me think of the sun god, Apollo. Just his presence is unique and it is very hard to take your eyes off him, because his acting is so believable.<br /><br />I also strongly believe that the movie just wouldn't be the same if it weren't for the music and the artwork. The costumes are brilliant and really make the cast stand out. Everyone works so well together.  The special featuers are also a special treat. Duchess Sarah Fergusoneven gives a little speach about Peter Pan's past and his meaning in today's society. You also learn about some of the tragedies that author John Berrie faced as a young boy, and the first idea that became the Peter Pan story.<br /><br />This is a great family movie. It's good for the parents to watch with the kids. It teaches kids how to help friends, and facts and points about having to grow up. But of course the real treasure that lies in Peter Pan is the beautiful magic itself.
B0006MT314|4.0|One tree hill is the best place available right now to discover new music. Aside from single handedly launching the careers of Gavin DeGraw and Tyler Hilton, it has also helped little known bands such as Keane and Snow Patrol, however, if you've watched the show from the beginning and have been dreaming about the perfect soundtrack, you may be disappointed. It's a myth to me, after all of the excellent selections for the show, why the soundtrack has been so poorly put together. Some of the best songs ever featured, including snow patrol's Run, from the first season finale, Jimmy eat world's 23, and Keane's she has not time, are all absent. There is no Johnathan rice, I am Kloot, modest mouse, Dashboard confessional, or Ben Lee on this soundtrack, even though those songs were some of the most memorable from the series.     I realize that both keane and jimmy eat world already have songs on the CD, but both of the aformentioned songs are better and more memorable than the two on the CD, and Tyler hilton had two songs, so why can't they? They're better. The exclusive material is nice, and Sidewalks and the live version of I don't wanna be, are some of the most fun songs on the CD, but the actual version of tyler hilton's glad is better than the acoustic, and I don't ever want to hear Sheryl crow's rendition of the first cut is the deepest again, let alone the acoustic version. This leads me to the Wreckers and Tyler hilton and Bethany joy lenz. \\"The good kind\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album, as is when the stars go blue, and Bethany Joy Lenz is definately talented. If nothing else, by the CD for these two exclusives.            Other highlights include Overdue, by the little know get up kids, Shoot your gun by the 22-20's, mixtape by butch walker, and Keane and Jimmy eat world's contributions. There is one more great song, but beforethat, I must tell you what the problem is with TV soundtracks. The best songs that really catch your ear when first featured onthe show, are the ones that make you go out to buy the album. For that reason, I had to cut the Keane and Jimmy eat world out when I ripped it onto my iPod because I already had the albums. I replaced them with some other great songs, but the thing is, it seems like I never have the best songs on the soundtrack when I listen. It was wise of them to put some stuff not yet featured. That way, they can get the fans money before they go off to buy the actual album. For that reason, I am going to exclude those two songs, and say that in second comes Lie in the sound, by the completely unknown trespassers william. It's beautiful, and it's definately a welcome suprise.     But above all is Butch Walkers \\"Mixtape\\" a song with flawless melodies and pianos mixed with Walkers execllent voice and lyrics that creates four minutes of the best music you'll hear this decade. Butch Walker is well on his way to being the best solo artist on the scene today, and with one of the best albums of 2004 and a debut just as good, it looks as if this guy will entrance and gain fans, while never losing the old ones.              Overall, the soundtrack it good, aside from several mis-steps (the almost painful funny little feeling and the slightly boring re-offender,and the first cut is the deepest) which I would of liked to have replaced by better songs, I rank it close to the OC soundtrack, but despite the fact that One Tree Hill has featured better music overall than the OC, the OC soundtracks remain better and more innovative collections. It offers fans many familiar sounds, and a few suprises. It's good, but the show has featured better songs.
B00000IAU3|4.0|People who like Sarah McLachlan are sure to like Dido. They have a similar style in lyrics and in tone. Dido gives us more of a polished and spiritual sound. Her lyrics are very nice.
6301934229|4.0|There can be something almost magical over 80:ies movies. \\"Terminator\\" has it. Especially the ending with the desert road and synthersizer music. The same kind of magic is present in \\"The Hitcher\\". <br /> <br />A young man is almost falling asleep on the road, early in the morning. He stops to take up a hitchhiker. From there on event follow upon event with nightmarish logic. Literally. (Maybe it all is a nightmare?) Great acting by the main characters. Actually very good acting throughout the film. And Hauer is cold as ice as the hitcher/madman. <br /> <br />The fine synthetic music and beautiful nature pictures sets the mood. Add some action, and good dialogue scenes. This horror/action/thriller is not for all tastes, but it is very well done.
B000002U9L|4.0|To me, this is just a really fun album. Bowie doesn't actually sing a lot in the film but it does have some lovely instrumental songs. The songs Bowie sings are: 'Opening Titles'including 'Underground, Magic Dance' - David Bowie (Okay, maybe it's the kid in me but I love this song), 'Chilly Down' - David Bowie, 'Within You' - David Bowie (I like this one but I sometimes find it hard to understand what he is saying), and 'Underground' - David Bowie.  This, the last song that Bowie sings, is the song that is played when Jareth turns back into an owl. There are twelve songs in all on this CD. Really good music and fun for people who like the film.
B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors go out with a bang...their best album in fact. This album is a masterpiece of blues-rock. I'd give every song atleast a 9/10. Even though it only has 3 10/10's(Most albums I give 5 stars to usually have 4 or more 10/10's) two of those 10's are among the greatest songs ever recorded. I can't say enough about L.A. Woman, basically the song that got me into The Doors. It is probably The Door's best and one of the greatest songs ever, as well as being the best driving song of all time. Riders on The Storm is nearly as good. Been Down So Long is my favorite non-epic song, and like I already said, every other song is great.
0316172324|1.0|The author's first book was pretty damn good. (The Tipping Point). here he attempts to tackle to subject of intuition and gut feeling but it never really suceeds. His writing style to constantly come back to an example he cited earlier made the book feel repetitive and burdensome. <br />I wish that this book was better because the premise was pretty good. Too bad!!
B000002UWL|5.0|This album is simply astounding as it showcases how lush and beautiful electro-pop can sound. You will begin to realize how talented Neil and Chris are as each song unveils and unwinds into an amazing tapestry of sound.<br /><br />You can hear a whole orchestra perform and yet you try to fathom which is real and which is synthesized. The best part is the end result is just so beautiful you wouldn't bother to figure out anymore how they did it.<br /><br />I loved \\"To face the truth\\" as the beauty of this piece only hits you after a few hearings.<br />\\"My October Symphony\\" is I think a labour of love as the song will linger in your mind for the next few days after you have listened to it for the first time. Listen towards the end when the Boys employ the hardly used cello for that heart-string tugging effect. So moving!<br />\\"Only the wind\\" is another soul stirring song as Neil Tennant's almost angelic voice plays with the simplistic melody.<br />And boy, are the fast songs good! The Boys drive \\"So hard\\" and proves that \\"Being Boring\\" is not what you are when you own this CD!<br /><br />The other songs are also very good as well and there are no fillers here. I will be their fan for life!
B00005UKE0|5.0|\\"All Things Must Pass\\" was George Harrison's first real solo album ( the previous only contained instrumentals). Most of the songs were written while the Beatles were still existing, and George was writing so many great songs during the final years of the 1960's that, when the Beales finally folded in early 1970, he had songs enough for a double album. Eventually it  turned out to be a triple album, with the 3rd record containing \\"jams\\" with George and his good friends, such as Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon.<br /><br />Like most Harrison fans I regard \\"ATMP\\" as George finest album. Many of his greatest songs come from this LP. Though there is a great variety of styles and moods on the album,  particularly the ballads stand out. Songs like \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", \\"Run of the Mill\\", \\"Behind That Locked Door\\", \\"Beware of Darkness\\" and \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" are simply moving. His version of Dylan's \\"If Not For You\\" beats Dylan's own version by miles. Among the other up-beat number I especially like \\"What is Life\\". The bonus-track \\"I Live For You\\" is gem; incredible that this song was not originally included.<br /><br />A lot of the acoustic guitars are played by Badfinger's Pete Ham and Tom Evans, who were two young very talented song-writers themselves and who had already witten the classic \\"Without You\\" at this time. For Pete Ham, who wrote Badfinger' greatest hit-records,  Harrison may have been the biggest inspiration among the Beatles. There are many similarities among these two great musicians' songwriting and musical arrangements. Try listen to Badfinger's \\"Straight Up\\" album, which was partly produced by George.<br /><br />This 2 CD set is must have for any Beatles or Badfinger fan!

B0006SSOHM|5.0|Where this movie lacks in acting, it's totally made up with the plot and action.  The ideas that were put into this movie can only be thought up by a mad man, yet I believe he deserves an award.  This is not a 'jump out of your seat' scary movie, but more of a 'put the popcorn down because of an upset stomach' movie.  Yank this off the shelf a.s.a.p.
B000001XMR|5.0|Josef Krips is my favorite conductor of all time, especially of Mozart. I had never heard him conduct Verdi, and even though he would have been of an advanced age in 1971 (the year of this recording), I bought it anyway.  <br /> <br />This is good collection of highlights: it is over 70 minutes long and includes pretty much every major aria and ensemble in the opera. The conducting of Krips is, as I expected, logical and elegant in his Viennese fashion. As another reviewer has noted, there are a few beats where the singers and orchestra aren't in the same groove - but it's a live performance, and the performers are on their toes and are back together in no time. These mistakes are merely ripples and no energy is lost.  <br /> <br />Nicolai Gedda annd Ileana Cotrubas (who is to me the most splendid of all Violettas), are no-brainers. They sparkle together in as Alfredo and Violetta should, and sink together properly later on as well.   <br /> <br />The recording quality is merely decent; but for a budget label, such is hardly unexpected. Get this if you like Krips, or great conducting in general, and certainly if you enjoyed Cotrubas in the Kleiber set.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Hunky Dory is such a great, and timeless album. Above all, the melodies are ridiciously strong. The first half of the album is exceptional; not a weak track among them. Just when you you think it can't get any better, the next song starts and just blows you away all over again. The second half is still strong, but is a bit of a letdown compared to the first. A few too many tributes to personal favourites of Bowie; they are on the fringe of being dated and silly, but fortunately their strong melodies prevent them from being so. And there to the rescue comes the closing track The bewlay brothers; one hell of a song that can compete with any song on the first half, or any other Bowie song for that matter, or any other song period. It makes you forget things went a bit downhill on the second half of the album. Besides: with a first half like Hunky Dory's, there's absolutely no shame in that. A classic, and must-have album this one.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. The characters were totally pathetic, so pathetic that they were nearly catatonic. It had a lot of really funny lines and situations. As others have noted, not much of a plot, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I knew guys like that in high school and junior high. They smelled funny and this movie really captures the smell. Each scene gradually revealed a little more about the world of degradation and misery that they inhabited. Many scenes portrayed situations so awkward that you could only sit there and cringe. The movie had a lot of style and did a great job of portraying a milleau that may be all too familiar to many.

B000683VI4|4.0|When evaluating a tear-jerker love story - as this is being classified - the cry factor goes a long way towards determining the effectiveness of the movie. My wife and I watched this for Valentine's Day and she went through half a box of tissues in 2 hours. Not bad for a tear-jerker.<br /><br />For me personally, I liked this movie for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Two relatively unknown lead actors. You might remember Ryan Gosling as one of the teammates in \\"Remember the Titans\\". Rachel McAdams strays from her usual portrayal of a spoiled teen in movies such as \\"Hot Chicks\\" and \\"Mean Girls\\". They were both rather effective in this setting because first of all - they did a great job of acting through the dramatic scenes and second of all, because they are relative newcomers, the audience identifies better with them. The love story can be any couple in the audience or any couple next door just like McAdams and Gosling portray.<br /><br />2) Period transformation - The art designers did an excellent job of transforming storefronts and entire streets into the post WWII era.<br /><br />3) Agonizing decision - We all knew what the ending was going to be. The impressive thing about this movie was that even though we knew the ending, the way in which the director got there still made the audience feel the pain of the decision making process and in that process generated alot of tears.<br /><br />4) Director's point of view - it was a poignant touch to tell this story as a flashback (or in \\"notebook\\" form) and with the situation the couple was in. It added an extra tragic dimension to the film which only added to the tear-jerker factor.<br /><br />Here's why the movie only got 3.75 Stars:<br /><br />1) Contrived story - A couple who are each other's first love gets separated and then gets back together after girl almost marries some other guy. This has been done numerous times over the years - most recently of which I can remember in Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />2) Cheesy ending - I won't state it, but the ending (when the couple is older - played by Garner and Rowlands) is a cheesy way out to wrap up this movie into a neat little bow.<br /><br />3) War scenes - they sucked. We really needed to feel the time apart (7 years) that the couple experienced and the director failed to instill that by putting in token weak war scenes. Gosling looked out of place on the battlefield and the lack of emotion from his best friend's death was disappointing.<br /><br />4) Relationship development - I'm usually not in favor of long drawn out 3 hour movies but I feel in stories such as this when the character development is the focal point of the story (not the action scenes) then we need to sympathize with the characters. We can only do that when we are deeply immersed into their lives. I would have liked to see more about the summer romance and the couple's interaction with her parents.<br /><br />Overall - I've seen much worse chick-flick love stories and not too many which are better. I'm pretty harsh with movies such as this so a 3.75 star rating means in my book - this is worth a rental.it, but the ending (when the couple is older - played by Garner and Rowlands) is a cheesy way out to wrap up this movie into a neat little bow. <br />3) War scenes - they sucked.

I rarely read comic books or graphic novels (nothing against them, it is just they aren't my m&eacute;tier), so I'm not biased to review a Neil Gaiman book -- actually I have never read anything wrote. \\"American Gods\\" was my first experience approaching Gaiman's universe, and it left me with mixed feelings. I know this book has won prizes and hype, but that doesn't mean much nowadays -- when prizes are rather political.<br /><br />However much I found the idea very interesting and thought provoking, I have to admit that \\"American Gods\\" is poorly executed and lacks a good editing. Gaiman seems to be the kind of writer who is dominated by the form of the book he is writing -- instead of he himself dominating the form. Due to his graphic novels experience, he seems not to give credit to his reader's imagination. The fact that a novel doesn't have images affects his descriptions, making the text over-repetitive and over-explained.<br /><br />Gaiman is what we could call a key-in-the-pocket writer. For instance, if he has to tell you that a character found something important in a room. He begins by saying that this character has a key in his pocket, then this person will get the key, introduce it in the key hole, turn it, grab the doorknob and bla bla bla... until he says that the character found a bos in the room. All the previous actions don't count to make texture or to move the story forward. So cut the beating around the bush short, please. This is where an editor would step and tell \\"Neil, my dear, let's work a little more in this text. You can thrust the ellipse. They can be effective\\".<br /><br />But, since Gaiman has a graphic novel God status, nobody seems to have courage to tell him how poor his text is. But we can't hate this writer. If on the one hand, he has all these problems with his texts, on the other, after boring you with pages of painfully useless descriptions, he comes up with such a brilliant sentence, that you feels like patting him on the shoulder, like a friend who has a problem but we are okay with it.<br /><br />But it is still something to think of how somebody writes a book with almost 600 pages and don't develop a character at all. Supposedly \\"American Gods\\" is a kind of quest that the protagonist goes through. In the beginning Shadow, the man, lacks personality and will. So, one hopes he will have acquired at least one in the end -- or that being in contact with Gods will change him. But not, this is not what happens. He is supposed to be an average guy, and that's why Gaiman made him so plain -- that's the only explanation. But Shadow doesn't have an average guy appeal.<br /><br />The narrative, that is rarely put forward, is fragmented and confusing -- in place of being epic and meaningful. However \\"American Gods\\" is a page-turner, it is never memorable. The over repetition and stereotypes character never accomplish much. I believe that Gaiman wanted to writer an allegory criticism the contemporary America -- or the Western World as a whole-- but he never delivers it. For one thing, he could start writing Americans speaking Americans, and not British. Just because he uses the word `carousel', instead of `merry-go-round' doesn't mean they are talking American.<br /><br />One of the best things of reading \\"American Gods\\" is that it made me enjoy Chuck Palahniuk's novels even more. Gaiman seems to have the same coolness of the creator of the \\"Fight Club\\". But while the American writer knows how to keep it short, moving and with a point, Gaiman is exaggerated, sometimes boring, and doesn't know where he is really heading to. He could have made a great book with \\"American Gods\\", and should start by locking the door and throwing away the key. Because, so far this is much ado about nothing.ting him on the shoulder, like a friend who has a problem but we are okay with it. <br /> <br />But it is still something to think of how somebody writes a book with almost 600 pages and don't develop a character at all.

B000002MY3|5.0|This is the BEST album Alanis did. There is NOT one song on here that is bad. What happened? The last couple of albums don't even compare, I want the mad ALanis back!
B0001AP12G|1.0|Another album with references that exploit religion and use Jesus as a figurehead. I find this incredibly offensive that this petty excuse of a 'musician' (there don't seem to be many real ones around anymore) can manage to write a song called \\"Jesus Walks\\" and have an album with explicit lyrics. I have my share of explicit albums (Against All Auhtority, The Fartz, Public Enemy, etc) and I love them, but they are set away from this album for many reasons. one in particular, they don't exploit Jesus, Allah, Yahweh, God, etc. Two, they play instruments and share emotions other than \\"ooo I'm a talentless rap star, I'm making money off of complete IDIOTS that understand as much about music as I do. Keep the dumba**es coming so I can get some crack money.\\" I'm sorry for all of you that enjoy this album, but if you're looking for a musician with talent, no, a musician period, please look up Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Elmore James, or someone that can sing and play.
B000050HTO|4.0|Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 3 Stars<br /><br />For anyone who is new to Bob Dylan or for anyone who is just looking for a single release of his biggest and best known songs, this is a decent place to start. \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\" (2 CDs, 30 tracks, 124 min.) thankfully provides a chronological overview of those 'essential' songs. CD1 (56 min.) covers the period through 1967. Inexcusably absent are \\"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\\" and, even more so, \\"I Want You\\", a genuine hit (from \\"Blonde on Blonde\\"). CD2 (68 min.) covers the late 60s through the Oscar-winning \\"Things Have Changed\\" in 2000. Again inexcusably absent are \\"Changing of the Guard\\", the hit from \\"Street Legal\\", and \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\". Why Columbia didn't take full advantage of the 80 min. capacity of CDs is a mystery to me. They could've easily added another 30-35 min. on this collection. But the music that IS on here, is top-notch, obviously.<br /><br />Interestingly, the release of \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\" here in Fall, 2000 coincided more or less with the release in Europe of \\"The Best of Bob Dylan Volume 2\\", which followed the release in 1997 of Vol. 1 (both of which are available here on Amazon). Take those 2 CDs together, and you have a better and deeper compilation of the \\"essential\\" Bob Dylan songs.
0312263120|2.0|This is my first Dan Brown book, and it made me wonder what the hype is all about.  The story is only mildly engaging, with plenty of mistakes and blunders along the way.  The astonishing number of cliffhangers paraded through this book made the story seem poorly thought out.  I knew by the median page who the real villain was and his motivations.  I knew by page fifty that Dan Brown didn't really know what he was talking about.  Still, because it was recommended to me by family, I persisted with the book.  I would recommend it to high schoolers; it exists at about that level of complexity.  Any one else, read if you have plenty of leisure time and don't want to have to think beyond your nose.
0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" describes a series of societies that have failed, and attempts to find a common theme among those failures. Easter Island and the Norwegian colony in Greenland; the more recent genocide in Rwanda. Small societies and more complex ones, ancient and modern, he tries to identify common threads.<br /><br />He also identifies societies with equally limited resources that have adapted to their environment and succeeded. Iceland, Papua New Guinea and Japan. He contrasts those successes with the failed societies to test his hypotheses.<br /><br />While many reviewers have characterized this book as the \\"flip-side\\" of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" I think it is more accurate to view it as an extension of that book, and examination of what happens to societies who start off with the conditions and natural resources that allow them to succeed, as those resources are consumed.<br /><br />Some reviewers - and I'm afraid I must question whether they have actually read the book - dismiss Diamond's hypotheses as \\"academic trash.\\" I think they do so at their peril. Diamond's observations and conclusions should give any thinking Westerner pause. It is inarguable that our present pattern of resource consumption is unsustainable, as Diamond demonstrates. The only issue is the consequences of that reality. In disturbing ways, those who blindly criticize this book demonstrate Diamond's point.<br /><br />Diamond has also been criticized for being simplistic. That's a criticism that is made of every science writer who attempts to write for a wider audience than academia. Diamond's intended audience is not prepared for von Thunen circles or Spenglerism. It is true that Diamond has simplified matters a bit, but that's significant only if Diamond, in his attempt to make his writing accessible, distorts the facts. I suggest that, for the most part, Diamond's explanations are accurate.<br /><br />I have a few minor quibbles: for example, he suggests that post-ice age hunters exterminated North America's megafauna. Recent research indicates that many of those species were in steep decline long before humankind arrived in North America, and that hunting, at most, accelerated their disappearance. But that's a quibble.<br /><br />Diamond describes himself as \\"cautiously optimistic about our society's ability to recognize the risks we are undertaking and to react correctly and in time. I am much more skeptical. Certainly the current U.S. government calls to mind the Greenland colony chieftains and the Easter Island tribal chiefs, who ignored the evidence of collapse all around them, and succeeded only in making sure they were the last to starve to death.<br /><br />This is a book of amazing scope. It is superbly written. It has frightening implications for anyone who can see beyond their own immediate self-gratification. It is folly to dismiss these ideas; it is dangerous to ignore them. Your grandchildren will not thank you.auna.

0876852630|5.0|The quality of Bukowski's poetry is questionable. His short stories are very sharp, very desperate, very amused. Tthe short stories are what Bukowski did best, while his novels are of very uneven quality.  <br />This said, the three novels of Bukowski's trilogy (Factotum, Post Office, Women) are his best novels and factotum is the best of the three. Women was written and published in the late 1970s when Bukowski or his alter ego Henry Chinaski was already an establihsed professional writer. Post Office covers the years in which he Bukowski had a sort of regular job and regular life. <br />Factotum is the story of the young Bukowski, the Bukowski that was rolling from a job to another, from a town to another, from a woman to another, in an impressive collections of failures--failed jobs, failed relationships, failed everything all told with a considerable amount of irony. <br />It's a very interesting read, to say the least. Five stars.
B000002AS3|5.0|The Bealtes were the band of the 60s and Oasis is the band of the 90s and into today. This cd is the most selling cd in UK history and after giving it one listen you'll know why. Like every other cd, this one is great. The first song Rock n Roll Star shows us why they are so great right from the beginning. if it was not for this cd i wouldn't know of oasis because american music has sucked for th emost part since the late 90s. Live Forever and the silent classic Slide Away are 2 reasons why you should buy this cd and the rest of theirs
B0000399WI|5.0|This is by far the best movie that I have ever seen and I think most would agree. First of all the script is perfect. At the opening of the movie you are thrown into the life of Andrew Dufresne who is being charged with a crime that he did not commit. He is sentanced to serve out his time at Shawshank Prison. From there a friendship sparks with him and another inmate named \\"Red\\". The movie is about his life and how he adapts to prison with a great ending. With a cast including Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman it's no wonder why this movie did so great at the Academy Awards. The DVD edition has a great clean crisp picture with outstanding sound. Your sure to love this movie and your DVD collection isn't complete without it!
B000002BBY|5.0|Wow it the first word i thought of when Hello came on. This cd is probably one of the best follow-up cds ever. I love Oasis and every cd the same. If i were to tell people what cd to buy first id say this one just because wonderwall is on it. I do not care for that song because everyone else loves it, but to start off i would tell people to get this one. Cast no shadow and Morning Glory are awesome. Hey Now is a great song too, but no one ever talks about it. Then there is Some might say and Roll With it, which are also instant classics along with She's Electric and CS.
B000068QY7|5.0|they have been around for almost 10 years and you wold think they would be done soon. Well this album doesnt even let that cross your mind. Noel has done it again and his brother Liam even wrote a couple songs, which are fabulous. Force of Nature is like a Don't look back in anger because of its melody and softness. Stop crying your heart out is great. It reminds me of wonderwall, but much much better. Then there is Little by Little , which i dont want to say, but could be the best song on the cd. Noel has done it again and Shout it out loud, a b-side from this cd, should have been on the cd too. Even the b-sides are great, he should have put them all on this cd.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I really like SW.  I have enjoyed it since I first saw it, and loved all the characters from all three films.  I must say, TESB is my favorite, but I love them all.<br /><br />These CD's have positives and negatives.  It would be nice if us, the paying public could, if we so chose, get the ORIGINALS ... I am sure there are lots of use out here who would pay an additional 10 bucks, just to have a copy of the film that we saw when we were younger.  IF for no other reason, to be able to see it in its original setting/score.<br /><br />However, my tapes were getting crappy, and I have rebought them from time to time since everyone in my family watches them fairly reguarly.  SO, having a copy on CD is nice.  And there are aspects of the new version that are pretty good:  For one, I can't remember seeing the film looks so shiny.  Some of the scenes do get enhances with more spaceships flying around... and it is nice to see the detail that even good VHS would not show.<br /><br />All in all, it is a very nice package, and I will mention that the DOCUMENTARY is one of the best I have ever seen, as far as interviews and behind the scenes.  Very good indeed.  I only subtact ONE star due to the fact that the people should be able to have a copy of the original, but I am really only quibbling at this point and five stars it should really get.  Still, a nice copy of the original....???<br /><br />Cmon G Lucas, give it up.  Grin.<br /><br />Have fun.
B000000XB9|5.0|All greatest hits collections are a disappointment, missing half the gems and always incorporating an embarrassment or two. This is the exception that proves the rule.  <br /> <br />Rather than get fancy, Fantasy just picked the 20 chart toppers by Fogarty and the boys, the actual greatest hits. And whether because Creedence was just a consistently fine, every B side an A side, band, or because the public for once was right, this has all the songs the casual fan would demand. The one substitution I'd make is to trade in \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\" for \\"Born on the Bayou\\", but every cut here is a keeper. That pieces like \\"Lodi\\", \\"Commotion\\", and \\"Long as I Can See the Light\\" don't get the steady airplay they deserve on classic rock outlets makes them no less classic. <br /> <br />The more time goes by, the clearer it gets how good Creedence Clearwater really was. Because they followed no fashion and set no fashion, there's nothing here to get dated. No extended guitar-hero solos, just unforgettable tunes, relentless or rollicking rhythms, bass lines built like a brick outhouse. Fogarty wrote simple, visionary lyrics that dug for and struck a deeper and more universal root than the era's protest songs. His vocals never call attention to themselves with self-conscious phrasing like Jagger's do (much as I do love Mick); they just serve the song, conveying through energy alone a world of timeless anger, joy, or endurance every time.  <br /> <br />Everyone must have at least one Creedence album. Unless you intend to buy four or five, this is the one you must have. Every other compilation falls short.

B00005JN0T|4.0|The 2004 sci-fi action thriller \\"I, Robot\\" was inspired by a collection of short stories of the same name and written by Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) in 1950.  It was in this collection of sci-fi stories that Isaac Asimov introduced his three laws of robotics, which define for a robot its interactions with humans.  These three laws were the basis for the 2004 film's story, not the collection of short stories themselves.  This undoubtedly left left many theater patrons who have read Asimov's works disappointed with the film because unlike the short stories, the film's plot is built around a human character named Del Spooner (Will Smith), who is a technophobic police detective.  The film opens in the year 2035 with the apparent suicide of a brilliant scientist whose work in robotics has made the fictional company of \\"U.S. Robotics\\" more powerful than Microsoft could ever hope to have.  Called upon to investigate the suicide, Del Spooner personally knew the dead scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell, who played Dr. Zefram Cochrane in the 1996 \\"Star Trek VIII: First Contact\\").  However, Del's mistrust of technology, and especially robots, puts him at odds with the CEO of U.S. Robotics, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), who instead has him speak to one of Dr. Lanning's associates, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan).  While investigating Dr. Lanning's office at U.S. Robotics (where he is believed to have flung himself through a window), Del & Susan are startled when an NS5 robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) leaps from its hiding place.  Del is convinced that Sonny murdered Dr. Lanning, but no one believes him since that would violate the three laws of robotics that are programmed into every robot.  Further, such a situation would be highly embarrassing for U.S. Robotics, which is planning to release its new NS5 robots for use by the general public, who currently use the earlier NS4 models.  Undeterred, Del continues his investigation, but someone clearly doesn't like what he is doing as NS5 robots start to attack him.  The only question is who? <br /> <br />Having read so many poor reviews for \\"I, Robot\\", I was pleasantly surprised by the film upon having the opportunity to view it myself.  The special effects and cinematography are quite good, and the story itself, which was written by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, is entertaining even though it is not an actual Asimov work.  I do highly recommend the documentary included on the DVD that explains the making of \\"I, Robot\\". It was quite interesting to see how the robots in the film were created through a combination of live actors and CGI.  Though I understandably cannot necessarily recommend the film to Asimov purists, overall, I do rate \\"I, Robot\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  People familiar with the 1994 film \\"The Crow\\" and the 1998 film \\"Dark City\\" will no doubt recognize director Alex Proyas' handiwork with \\"I, Robot\\".
B0001XWV12|4.0|This movie is based on nothing but prejudices. It's big fun all the time and I couldn't stop laughing at all when I watched Eurotrip. Four American teenagers who are exploring 'tiny' Europe... <br /> <br />... Europe, well, Rome is situated at the place where you usually will find Moscow when you take a look at the map and Amsterdam has nothing to do with the real Dutch capital. Amsterdam looks like Venice!  <br /> <br />Europe seen through American eyes... You want to travel from London to Paris? Walking, swimming, it only takes a few hours. Old Europe is so small, Paris is a suburb of Berlin. Hehe... of course they blow it up all the time, which makes it all quite predictable, but for Europeans it's extremely amusing to be faced with the so-called American thoughts about Europe.  <br /> <br />I must admit that I never have been in America, so perhaps all my  prejucides about this huge country should be dumped by me. Otherwise I'll travel with the same stupid attitude as the 4 American 'Eurotrippers' use to do, haha! <br /> <br />Last but not least I'd like to point out that this is a movie which you should watch with a couple of friends and enough beer! I guarantee that you won't stop laughing until the last second of the film! And p.s.: I recommend the soundtrack of Eurotrip as well.
0451199871|5.0|A Solid Murder-Mystery<br /><br />This Agatha Christie novel is a solid story with some very interesting characters.  And best of all, it jumps right into the intrigue when Dolly Bantry, Mistress of Gossington Hall, is informed by her housemaid that a body has been found in the estate's library.  From that point on, the cast of characters is introduced, and one-by-one they are added to the possible list of suspects - or at least people of interest.<br /><br />Agatha Christie uses just the right touch of humor and suspense in this book.  I consider it a classic that should be read by most school children.  It is short enough to not intimidate the average reader, yet long enough to be a memorable read.<br /><br />The motive and suspects are just vague enough to keep the reader guessing at \\"Who-dunnit?\\" the whole story.  The only flaw in this book is that the reader is never really given enough information about one of the characters - Dinah Lee.  Other than that, this is another must-read by Agatha Christie.

Oprah-readers like fast and shallow books, and she has disappointed them picking profound and complex novels -- like this one and Anna Karenina.

B00005JLRT|3.0|Nemesis, ostensibly the final huzzah for the long-lived Next Generation crew, has its moments but never quite gels into a cohesive, compelling film. The opening tone of the movie is perfect: Troi and Riker getting hitched (finally); Worf, Data and Picard off on an expedition to find the source of anomalous Data-like signatures; unrest on Romulus. Well and good. Unfortunately, the movie begins to hit the skids there. The story, written by John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator), is off his characteristically high standards. Logan has proven himself able to find the personal amid the epic, and Star Trek is often both, so he might seem an ideal candidate to pen this installment. However, this tone of this movie is too dour and too dark for most people to truly find enjoyable. This, I suspect, is more a direction problem than a screenplay problem (more on that in a minute), so I'll give Logan a pass. But you're on watch, Mr. Logan. The dialogue here is at its least memorable for Trek, all utilitarian, and although it mostly avoids cliche, it doesn't ever sparkle. There's no \\"the line must be drawn here\\" speech, sadly. There's an \\"I would be this guy if I grew up like he did\\" speech, in fact, there are quite a few of them. Cheer up, Jean-Luc, you'd probably have turned out like Idi Amin if you'd grown up like him. On an unrelated topic, I think Picard would have made a smashing dictator: imagine a planet full of bald, Shakespeare-quoting English-accented Frenchmen. Picardia. Rick Berman, give me a call. <br /> <br />This movie tries so hard to be the Next Generation crew's Wrath of Khan, with the obsessed, delusional villain, an outmatched and outgunned Enterprise, and a crew member's sacrifice. All that's missing is the heart. And a great deal of substance. Like Wrath of Khan, an outsider was brought in to direct this movie. Unfortunately, the outsider for Nemesis was Eurotrip and U.S. Marshals auteur Stewart Baird instead of the multitalented Nicholas Meyer. THE Nicholas Meyer (hereafter referred to as Saint Nick) had never directed a film before Wrath of Khan, but his outing in Khan was more than luck: this guy knew what he was doing. He managed to coax an entirely ham-free performance out of William Shatner, no small feat (and I love Bill Shatner, so don't scream at me). Khan was a seriously messed-up guy, but Ricardo Montalban played him with such magnetism and charisma you couldn't help but love the guy, at the very least love to hate him. Wrath of Khan was perfectly paced, technically marvelous, and full of touching (but not manipulative) moments. Saint Nick also co-wrote the screenplay for Star Trek IV and co-wrote and directed Star Trek VI, all the original series favorites. His resume speaks for itself. Let's look at Stewart Baird's resume. A quarter-remembered action flick from eight years ago, a raunchy teen sex comedy (coming in rated and unrated versions speaks for itself), and his magnum opus, Executive Decision, an inferior Air Force One copy. As a result of his action background, this movie often feels like a standard-issue thriller instead of a Trek film, with precious little thought and introspection in order to keep the action a-comin', and what thought there is becomes tiresome really quickly. In all fairness, the action is good, as are the special effects. But who cares? The story sucks. It is misdirected up the wazoo.  When it started, The Original Series had the most talented writing staff on television, and it had to: the shoestring effects were nothing special, and the budget was as empty as Scott Bakula's chair is now on Enterprise's bridge (cold, yes, but true). Well, Scotty B, it's time for a big Quantum Leap--to conventions! Okay, I'll stop, but I'll ask this question: Since when did the effects become more important than the substance? Why should I spend my hard-earned cash (in this case, my parents' hard-earned cash, because they treated) on a light show with an equally light story? Sadly, it seems, StarTrek is Trek as the producers have learned to play it: safe, unthreatening, but also soulless. Worrying about audience segmentation and profits does not a great movie make. Gene Roddenberry is, I hope, spinning in his grave, because his Star Trek was the other way around. Star Trek needed (and needs) a Deep Space Nine more than it could possibly know: if there is no new blood in the franchise, it will die of inbreeding. How many different alien names can you come up with, really? You're going to run out, eventually. As sad as it makes me feel, Nemesis is the future of Star Trek, not its past. <br /> <br />Say what you will about studio execs, but they can connect the dots:  most successful Trek pictures: Wrath of Khan, First Contact. Possible reasons: new directors, tension, excitement, epic action, substance. Lather, rinse, repeat. So, a great movie is a shopping list? If it's so simple, then why do so many movies suck? Apparently, the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy applies here--those factors were present in both films, but they weren't the reason they were great movies. These movies were spectacular because they spoke to timeless themes and gave the actors material to sink their teeth into, but also because they took extraordinary risks and succeeded wildly. Kirk is having a midlife crisis? Picard is obsessed with killing the Borg? These were quite bold risks to take with beloved characters decades in the making. Ultimately, for all the sermonizing and speechifying by Picard in this movie, this movie doesn't let him reject the thought that he could be the other guy, or be truly terrified of it. Data dies, but the B4 will probably take his place should another movie be made, and Riker not remembering the tune Data was whistling at Farpoint (Pop Goes the Weasel, by the way) doesn't nearly match the power of Kirk's final scene with his son at the end of Khan.  I would have liked to see what some really talented people could do with Star Trek: Paramount's got money, why not get great people to do this stuff (I fantasize about Aaron Sorkin writing a Trek movie), instead of second-rate action directors with portfolios consisting of fare that one sees during the summer, finds the ticket stub six months later in a coat pocket and can't remember the movie at all. Get Saint Nick Meyer on line one, Rick. You need him more than you know.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|Let's face facts, if you are dying to see this film I won't change your mind. This review is for those on the fence. A lot of the five star reviews talk about the low budget and twist ending so let's address that first. It is VERY apparent that a film has a low budget when the boom microphone is visible in approximately 8 shots in the movie. About five of which are in the opening minutes of the film (pay attention to \\"Adam\\" because that black spot above his head is not a film flaw). I saw this in a dollar theater so perhaps they have made enough money to digitally erase it from the DVD (if not those wacky college kids have a new drinking game-\\"take a shot for every time the boom mic appears\\"). Those boring hyper-cool quick cut flashy strobe like filming sequences that some of us remember being trite in the prime of MTV's \\"headbangers ball\\" days are over used and only make the film that much worse. They become especially ridiculous during a car chase sequence (why not just do a few quick cuts back and forth). The final \\"twist\\" ending involving the killer's identity is on some level morally off even to those not easily offended. They should have sat the killer down for a good viewing of \\"Ikiru\\". It did surprise me... in the sense that it had no real logic to it. Other than that, the two name actors (Elwes and Glover) phone it in. Probably because they saw the dailies and decided to just collect a pay check (everyone has to eat). The script is like a mix of \\"Fear Factor\\" and Donald Kauffman's writing before his untimely demise in \\"Adaptation\\". It provided me with many laughs as a whole and Mike (as the boom mic came to be known after sooo many appearences) made for a good running joke. However, in my meager two cents worth of opinion the people that are hailing this as genius are the same people that make movies like \\"Final Destination 2\\" commercial successes.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Lets see, 20 songs stretching the boundaries of contraversial, all using powerful and deviously subtle language such as 'Idiot'. You have to wonder why Green Day have sunk, reaching the kind of dim-witted thought strains that will no doubt earn them millions, but just so fake. The attempt to be contraversial is all too familiar. Probably people will think how cunning they are, how intelligent, when all it is a mashed up pile of anti war lyrics poorly executed. For a decent take on war, depending on your own opinion of course, listen to Pearl Jam.
B00006879E|1.0|Another band that prooves 'hype over content' is the poisoness cocktail slowly ruining contemporary guitar music.  I've tried to come up with a suitable logline - I hope you like it - Buy Maroon 5's Album - or soak yourself in tepid bath water.  Not particularly unpleasant, but you wont try it again. <br /> <br />Dreadful Dreadful dreadful. On behalf of Maroon 5, I appolgise to the real song writers.

B0006SSOHC|3.0|i just got back from my manager's house, and he already has this dvd. i'm not saying how he got it, but he has it already.  anyway, i watched this movie in the theater and left unhappy.  it has a decent flow, except for the parts where the camera gets hyperactive and crappy rock music blares for no real reason.  if it weren't for the stupid camera and crappy music, i would rate this movie higher.  don't believe me?  watch it, then you will see that i'm right.  the dvd is a pretty good deal.  possibly even worth buying for real slasher fans.  it comes in a cool case, but sadly the disc isn't really a saw... <br /> <br />okay, if you haven't seen the damn movie, here's the plot...the whole thing:  two guys are trapped in a room and they are both chained to pipes, big ones.  there is a dead guy in the middle of the room, apparently he blew his brains out, and his gun is still laying by his hand.  a voice on an intercom system tells the men what to do...their goals while they are prisoners.  the doctor (Ewles) has to find a way to break free in an alotted amount ot time and shoot the other guy with the dead man's gun.  or they can both use the saws they find and cut through their ankles to get free, but probably bleed to death.  and then there is this whole flashback world with a serial...puzzler, that sets people up to try and get them to appreciate their lives...or they will die.  and there is this whole drama involving cops and the doctor's family that i'm not even going to get into...it's pretty typical, with a hint of originality every once in a while.  but there are some parts that you just can't help but chuckle, and not for good reasons...i think i only really jumped one time in this whole movie, and i knew it was coming, so that doesn't count.  but there are some pretty neat aspects of this movie, some good gritty scenes, but overall it feels like Seven/Se7en leftovers.    <br /> <br />anyway, there is a pretty funny commentary between the two guys that wrote the movie (i don't remember their names, James Wan and somebody Leigh or something). one of them was in the movie and the other directed it.  it helps me understand how some of the acting was just plain terrible when they talk about only having 18 days to shoot the movie, and having to use some of the rehearsal takes as actual footage for the movie.  there are a few parts in the movie, mainly Danny Glover's parts, that you just can't help but laugh at how bad his acting is.  Cary Ewles wasn't that great either...okay, the acting in this movie isn't the best, but that isn't going to stop it from becoming a cult hit.  <br /> <br />so, is this dvd worth buying?  yes and no.  if you're into slasher movies and don't really care about plot holes or acting, then you will enjoy this movie and the extra features on the disc, mainly the commentary, which is mainly funny 'cause the two guys behind the movie just poke fun at their own creation the whole time.  if you DON'T enjoy violence (there really isn't that much actually shown, blood and guts i mean), then you probably won't like this.  if you fall into the second category, just rent it first. <br /> <br />Saw is a decent attempt at something new, and it succeeds for the most part.  i hear Saw 2 is coming out this October (2005), and i can only hope that they learn some good cinematography in the meantime, cause all that hard rock crap was really getting on my nerves, and it really destroys any possibility of true...\\"horror\\", if you will.  this dvd comes out tomorrow, and even if you've seen it in the theaters and liked it, rent it first, just to make sure it's worth owning and rewatching a million times before buying.  anyway, that's just my stupid advice.  i hope this helps at least one person.  sorry if not.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|The image of the Beatles was something different and fresh in 1964.  But the music wasn't.  The lyrics are nothing original, and their lyrics are not particularly full of originality or substance.  Don't get me wrong, this ain't a bad album.  The guitar playing was the best of the early 60's, and their exuberance and persona was to die for.  But the music is nothing special.
068987474X|5.0|I read this book yesterday and already I feel so much better about my breakup than I did before I read it. <br />Like so many women (sorry feminists but there are a huge amount of females like me) we can be totally blind to the blaring truth because we just don't want to see it. Our friends (bless them and their intentions) often tell us what we want to hear as well and that just prolongs the pain and confusion. (That's why when you've got a friend who give you the advice that this book gives you it's worth holding onto them, even if you don't want to hear the truth). <br />Without going too much into my own story I was with someone for 3 years. I had so many excuses as to why things weren't fantastic. It probably even made me work harder at the relationship even though I knew there was something better out there because I couldn't accept that I might have been wrong. Even when he couldn't say that he loved me, even though we were living together, I somehow came up with excuses as to why he couldn't say it and believed them myself. Surprise, surprise he's now finally turned around and said that I'm just not the one for him (I suppose I should be grateful because at least he's had the guts to say it - although I had to raise the subject and I had find the strength to leave him). I just wish I had read this book a year ago because I could have stopped dreaming that I could change him or that he really did want to be with me. <br />This book is refreshing as it doesn't wrap you in cotton wool. I reckon so many people are in therapy these days because they are trying to analyse and think things through so much but can't accept the real truth. As I read in another review, this book can touch all areas of your life and in short it goes back to the philosphy 'change what you can change, accept what you can't and have the wisdom to tell the difference'. <br />In this day and age we think that we can expect to get everything we want but sadly folks, that's just not true. Life isn't always fair but learn the lesson and move on as it's the only way to maintain your dignity and your sanity. <br />What's meant for you won't go past you and if someone has made a mistake by not treating you right or by letting you go they will realise it in their own time and will do everything they can to get you back if it's what they really want but who knows, by then you will hopefully have moved on with your life. If they have truely changed you should be wise enough to see it and if not, well, you know that you don't need them anymore as you'll be too busy with your life that doesn't include them. <br />We all have gut instincts and although our brains sometimes try and cover them over we know they are there. A number of people have mentioned mixed messages. Yes, that can be confusing but you have to ask yourself, as adults do we want someone in our life who is confused and who in turn is confusing us. Probably not! Move on ladies (and gentlemen). We can't all be wasting our time over something that's just not meant to be x
B000000WZ4|5.0|Except for several hits, I was rather foreign to Depeche Mode. Strengthened by my dislike for techno music, I had never bothered to find out more about the band until I accidentally obtained a copy of \\"Ultra.\\" The song \\"It's No Good,\\" with its upbeat rhythm and emotionally contradicted lyrics, possessed enough charm for me to give the album a try. To my tremendous surprise, after listening to \\"Ultra\\" a couple of times, I realized that I was hooked.    Techno music had always been stereotyped by me as cold, inhuman, and mechanical. However, thanks to Martin Gore's expertise, every song on \\"Ultra\\" is emotional and thought provoking. Although the band has gone through severe inner crises before the album was released, these calamities seem to have spurred remarkable depth in their creation. True, according to some reviewers, the album is somewhat schizophrenic: sometimes optimistic, other times dark and very depressing. Nonetheless, it amazes me that I can relate myself to most of the songs on the CD regardless of their diverse themes.    The songs on \\"Ultra\\" are mostly subdued, especially on the later half of the album. \\"Freestate\\" and \\"The Bottom Line,\\" sung by Gahan and Gore respectively, are emotive and have glints of exotic feelings. \\"Insight\\" is a stunning duet featuring both Gahan and Gore and is eerily satisfying. Moreover, \\"Home,\\" the third single from the album, is one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard. The background music, adorned by perhaps the guitar and strings, is remarkably captivating and creates the longing mood perfectly.     Else, the more upbeat songs are no less dazzling. The first single, \\"Barrel of a Gun\\" is probably the only song here that I do not care much for, but it resembles the precursor of the blend of rock and rap which is commonplace in modern days. \\"It's No Good\\" and \\"Useless,\\" both singles, are inspiring in their unique ways, despite the obscure lyrics. \\"Sister of Night\\" starts explosively but turns quieter when thevocals start ringing, and the setting of luscious desires really impresses me.    The instrumental tracks actually invite some criticisms on the album. In my humble view, they serve fittingly as transitions \\"Uselink,\\" in particular, is pretty flashy as an interlude. The others are not as banal to me as some people commented, but perhaps my acceptance is due to insufficient understanding of the band. Not matter.    \\"Ultra\\" definitely arouses my interest in listening to more of Depeche Mode's recordings. If you used to loathe techno as I did, this album will certainly make you take on a new look of the genre.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This CD is wonderful. It will deffinitley put you in a good mood because of Gavin's wonderful voice.
B0006399FS|1.0|Its alright for a while, but its quite ovious that this album will not stand the test of time - and that matters. <br /> <br />Even \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" has its classic U2 moments - particularly \\"Elevation\\" \\"Peace On Earth \\"Kite\\" \\"Walk On\\". <br /> <br />But this is just not good enough, and U2 promised more as well, and it makes music really unhealthy when its over commercialised and over - overhyped. <br /> <br />Music is in a sorry state, and U2 have joined in with that sorry state. <br />I mean, think back to the 90s, so many good bands and albums came out, but ever since the year 2000 eveything has started sounding fake - seriously - exceptions?  <br /> <br />Foo Fighters \\"One By One\\" <br />Oasis \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" <br />U2 \\"All that You can't Leave Behind\\" <br />Franz Ferdinhad \\"Franz Ferdinhad\\" <br />A Perfect Circle \\"Mer De Noms\\" \\"Thirtenth Step\\" <br />Tool \\"Lateralus\\" <br />Rage Against The Machine \\"The Battle for LA\\" <br /> <br />theres some others, but thoses albums are'nt ground breaking and certainly not the best by those artists, and not many of them have been recently released. <br /> <br />I can't believe U2 have settled this, and they were so much more. <br />It used to sound like they cared,they cared about the music - well it does'nt sound like it anymore. <br /> <br />Their are very very few U2 fans that like this album, and most that do are just people who have heard of U2 and cause they are popular at the moment. <br /> <br />That will pass in time. <br /> <br />Suggestions? DON'T TOUR THIS ALBUM!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I always root for the nerd in these movies, being an ex-high school nerd myself.  It was very funny, and the small details throughout the movie reminded me of my own adolescence in the 80's.  It was great to see Napoleon get his moment in the sun.
B000002N2P|5.0|It'll just blow you away. <br />Simple as that. <br /> <br />Today, I don't even want to think about what happened to this band, its just shamefull. <br /> <br />Music from the 90s sounds even better and more refreshing than it did when it came out, and to think this album has been around for almost 10 years, it just shows you that good music can't be shaken or move by trends, or popularity its as solid as a rock and won't be moved. <br /> <br /> At present all this new music thats coming out at the moment is utter crap. <br />Its shame Green Day succumbed to that too. <br /> <br />Listen to this album in 30 years time, it'll sound even more unique and amazing.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies I have seen, and most of my friends like it too.  They are all about my age.  We had a Girl Scout sleepover and watched it twice.  I like that Fiona is more than just a girl.  She can fight and we find out she is an ogre too.  I like a lot of kid's stories and alot of fairy tales, and this was fun for me to watch because I recognized some of the stories I read when I was younger like the gingerbread man and pinnochio.  I think they did a good job with this movie and I am glad it is on dvd so I can watch it over and over again.
B000002MP2|5.0|Insomniac is their best and edgiest. <br />But this album is just astounding, Billi Joe Armstrong was great songwriter, and still is if he stops writing (non)classics like American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams. <br /> <br />When I Come Around is one of the best rock songs of all time.
B00000ILGL|5.0|Anyone who could ever consider themself a fan of electronic music, be it the Neptunes or Aphex Twin, must hear this album.  It is simply awesome.  Moroder paved the way for techno music fully solidifying the idea that music can be made with synths, and later on, computers.  The songs still retain that disco soul, that can often be lacking in a lot electronic music and pop today.  This is really the perfect balance of old school disco beats and astonishingly modern sounding electronica.  A definite must have.
B000003TA4|5.0|Kurt Cobain was never a guitarist that was as good as Jimi hendrix or Led Zepplin. <br /> <br />But he wrote some mega songs and they are on this album. <br />He was a great song writer, not one of the best musicians of all time. <br />Which song has more feeling to it \\"Come As You Are\\" or \\"All along the watch tower\\" by Jimi Hendrix???
1594200106|4.0|It's a very good read. It makes you forget where you are and brings you to the time when love can be truly pure and selfless.
B0000027RL|3.0|Pearl Jam have musically have much better albums than this. <br />\\"Binural\\" \\"No Code\\" \\"Yield\\" even \\"Riot Act\\" is much nicer on the whole. Although many complain about Pearl Jam losing it with Vitolagy and ending after VS.  <br />So what, you'd rather hear another 5 albums of the same style of music. <br />Then you;d be saying, why don't they do something different, its just really really stupid. <br /> <br />There are some great guitar playing, Mike McCready is really good, but c'mon, its not that astounding. <br />And its kind of a bit sleepy at times too. <br />Best bits \\"Once\\" \\"Even Flow\\" \\"Black\\". <br /> <br />Nirvana being compared to Pearl Jam, I don't see the point. <br />Oh and this is not Grunge!!! - its called \\"music\\".
B000268QB2|4.0|I saw these guys on Saturday Night Live and liked the songs they did, so I thought I'd check them out.  Pretty good stuff.  It's refreshing to see new bands who actually have talent and artistic ability with music and lyrics.  I played this CD 5 times in a row the first day I got it - can't even think of one song that is bad.  This is the best british release I've heard since 1992's \\"Sense\\" by Lightning Seeds (still one of my all-time favorite CD's to listen to).<br /><br />Their music is familiar, yet very much their own.  Certain songs I can hear hints of 70's, 80's, and 90's music; yet it is very much today's music.  You can also imagine Paul McCartney's \\"Wings\\" band doing some of these songs back in the day.  This is a very strong release and I'm keeping my eye on these guys - very impressive to me.  I've considered more than 90% of all music made in this new millenium to be the worst music in all of music history - however, this band renews my faith that talented musicians are still out there and will be emerging soon (I hope!).
1400082773|5.0|When I picked this book I really had no Idea Barak Obama had such a diverse background.  It's a warm story about blood line, home, heritage and personal sacrifice.  Its a tale that shows you the identity crisis a mix raced person can go through yet find themselves whole once they decide to explore.  A must read for people in general but a must, must read for people trying to find the base of their heritage and existence.
0385510454|2.0|I could only read the first 100 pages. <br /> <br />If you were to read this book, not knowing who the author is, you would deem it unpublishable. <br /> <br />This is NOT an engaging page turner. From the first chapter, I realized that this book was written by somebody who has little expertise on the Washington political system.  This is the type of fiction that you realize could never really be true. <br /> <br />For example, we are to believe that one of the characters, Critch, who was at one time the President's Chief of Staff and political campaign chairman, can just walk around in pubs in London unrecognized by the public, after the election.  Can you imagine Jim Baker, Colin Powell, etc. just walking around Europe in complete obscurity? <br /> <br />Grisham obviously has enjoyed a few Italian vacations, and enjoys enlightening readers on the finer points of Italian cuisine and coffee beverages.   <br /> <br />So, save your money and read a classic, or buy yourself a nice Italian dinner instead. <br /> <br />
B0001WTUH6|3.0|The whole idea of werewolved versus vampires is a very interesting concept and I had some high expectations for the release of 2003's \\"Underworld\\".<br /><br /> In ways it is satisfactory but in other ways it fails to deliver. The special effects are really good and so are a lot of the action sequences.<br /><br /> Unfortunately a lot of the movie caters too much to MTV trends and it really tends to water down the greatness of this movie. The acting is decent though.<br /><br /> An ok film but this could've been a lot better.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Start getting your dancing shoes ready.... <br />Michael makes you want to dance the night away with his brand new second album. <br />   <br />I love the modern remakes of \\"You & I\\", Can't Buy Me Love\\", and \\"How Sweet It Is\\".  He gives each song something different to the table then the orignal music artists (especially \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" for all you jazz \\"CATS\\" out there).  Standards like \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\" & I've Got You Under My Skin\\" are revitalized by Buble.  A great duet with Nelly Furtado for the song \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\".  Nelly & Michael make a great team (not to mention...A GREAT CANADIAN TEAM).  Michael also wrote the track \\"Home\\", which I found to be quite pleasant for a newbie songwriter.  The lyrics and the music video are both very sweet.   <br />His voice is breathtaking.  His image is classy.  His music is timeless.  Buy this CD Quick.  You won't regret it.
B000002J03|5.0|This is such a brilliant album!!! From the driving riff of 'Whole Lotta Love' to the great bass playing on 'The Lemon Song' and John Bonham's enormous effort in 'Moby Dick', this album is essential. Track by track: <br />1 Whole Lotta Love - 10/10 <br />2 What Is And What Should Never Be - 9/10 <br />3 The Lemon Song - 10/10 <br />4 Thank You - 7.5/10 <br />5 Heartbreaker - 10/10 <br />6 Living Loving Maid - 9/10 <br />7 Ramble On - 8/10 <br />8 Moby Dick - 10/10 <br />9 Bring It On Home - 9/10 <br />  <br />This is great stuff. You'll think soo too.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Thank Heavens for the arrival of Michael Buble onto the music scene. Romance, love and music with meaningful lyrics  are finally available to those of us who enjoy sounds familiar to us from a bygone era when musical class meant you could understand and feel every note.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|hilarious and original comedy about a tall skinny nerd named Napoleon Dynamite, played with real \\"coolness\\" by Jon Herder and his uncle comes to take care of him and his brother when his Grandma goes on a little vacation with four wheelers and her buddies. Dynamite becomes friends with a new kid named Pedro and soon after Pedro becomes a contestant for Class President. Napoleon's Uncle and Brother try to sell products to gain money. Napoleon's Uncle is a sleazeball who wishes he could travel back in time and not lose a High School Football game. It's funnier as it goes along. A very different movie and its a real hoot to watch these people have fun with their parts. Probably one of the funniest movies that came out last year...a instant classic of its own mind.
B0000AFX64|2.0|I feel cheated, because the only reason I ordered this new (2/8/05) DVD release of Galactica is because I thought they're finally releasing a widescreen anamorphic (instead of letterboxed) version, because the technical details section in amazon explicitly states that this is the case.  WRONG!  As far as I can tell, this release is no improvement over the older DVD releases.  Still letterboxed and not enhanced for widescreen TV's, and not digitally remastered either.  The only thing they added are ads for the mini-series and the game on side B, which I don't really care.  Had I known this, I'd have just rented the older release instead.  What a bummer.  Don't buy this if you already have the old DVD release or can rent it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Before I heard Meteora, I liked the songs Numb and Lying From You from the radio. Buying this at the same time as Hybrid Theory, I found that Linkin Park's smooth transitions between the songs combined with their flowing lyrics make them a really good band. <br />A runthrough of the songs: <br />1. Intro: Interestingly enough, this sounds better if you listen to  it on a Playstation (original) using an AV cable (L/R audio) and only connect one audio plug. Seriously. <br />2. Don't Stay: The intro dives right into this song (making it impossible to upload the whole album onto your computer without ruining the effect because of the gap). A great song, but the guitar can get a bit stale if you listen to it multiple times. As in every single day at about 8 PM. <br />3. Somewhere I Belong: Great song. Mike's rhymes and Chester's singing are intertwined in the verses of this awesome song, but it, like Don't Stay, can get a bit stale. But only if you listen to it as repetitively as I do. <br />4. Lying From You: Arguably the best song on Meteora (There's a bunch of them). This song is slower than many of the others, but between the screaming chorus, the slow rhymes and the strong bridge, you get to hear a strange sample in the background. <br />5. Hit The Floor: Arguably the best song on Meteora (I said arguably, didn't I?). After listening to this a few times, I started to think of clouds. However, the awesome screaming chorus made them big thunderclouds. Again, thr bridge is great. <br />6. Easier to Run: Err... this was the point where I had to pull out my CD case to check the track. Not the greatest LP song, it was a bit dry and lacking the overflowing finesse of a Linkin Park song. The CD booklet says that Rob's drum in the song is extroardinary. I say, \\"There were drums in that song? I was asleep.\\" But if they \\"emerged from a free-writing exercise performed by Chester:he wrote them to no music, no beat\\" then you have to give them some credit. <br />7. Faint: A greatsong. It has some great lyrics and the first few seconds make a great MIDI ringtone. <br />8. Figure .09: I hate this song. I hate because they had to give it such a strange name. \\"Hey, have you heard the song Figure point-oh-nine?\\" But otherwise, this song is great. There is no way to describe it in a review without going too far in-depth. And I'd like to keep review this under 10 pages. <br />9. Breaking the Habit: Heard this one on the radio? \\"Great, another annoying overplayed radio song.\\" Right? Wrong. With no rap in this song, it shines in the screaming. Whatever sense that makes to you. Any song that can talk about stopping a drug addiction and making it sound like giving up nail-biting while still keeping the album's general structure- 2 verse, 1 bridge-screamy thing, and a killer chorus- is at the top of my list. <br />10. From the Inside: This song is alright... but if it had some better rap lyrics or a better background/opening, I might have some more appreciation for this song. <br />11. Nobody's Listening: This awesome song traces back to Linkin Park's roots: it's original intention of being a hip-hop/rock group from when they were called Hybrid Theory (Their CD:Hybrid Theory EP) is the basis for this song. It's almost what Linkin Park would have done if they were the ones making D12's song \\"Fight Music\\". And the looping Japanese flute sample kicks butt. <br />12. Session: This instrumental doesn't live up to Cure for the Itch. Cure for the Itch sounds lighter (or it could've just been my Playstation) than this song, which starts out slow and builds up. Still, it's a song worth listening to repetitively for at least a few days. <br />13. Numb: Originally, yes, this song was overplayed, but this doesn't make it bad. It ends the album with traces of many of the previous songs, while still making complete sense in the lyrics. <br />Overall, Meteora, while not all that much better than Hybrid Theory (Because Hybrid Theory is awesome, it's kinda hard to be better- I like the albums in conjunction), is definitely worth buying . Especially if you're gonna listen to it over and over and over...
B000025AKT|5.0|Make no mistake folks..this is a truly beautiful album from the first notes to the last Sri Lankin chanting. I have been an Oldfield fan for years and was very pleased with this when I first bought it when it came out. If I had to take only 5 of his albums to the proverbial desert island, this would be one of them. The other four? Crises. Incantations. Voyager. and of course, Tubular Bells (but the 2003 version). <br />This is grand music that only Oldfield could create. I say go for it.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I was not impressed with Lamb of God's prior releases but I was totally blown away by this one. They have finally hit their stride and found their voice. This thing just crushes and pounds like few do these days. One of the things that is great about this cd is that they have combined the loud crush of metal guitars and sound with complex yet accessible and melodic riffs and rhthyms. To the detractors I say c'mon what is really original in music anymore these days? These days it's not how original a band can sound, but how well they work their craft in creating something that breathes new life into an established genre. This cd will breathe new life into you!
B00005TT77|1.0|At the risk of sounding elitist, I've never been a fan of \\"tribute\\" albums, and I've never been a fan of cover versions of Beatles' songs....quite simply, covering Beatles' songs shouldn't be done (that said, there are a handful of worthwhile covers, namely Rickie Lee Jones' rendition of \\"For No One\\"). <br /> <br />However, with the likes of Rufus Wainwright, Sheryl Crow, and Sarah McLachlan, I was going to give this album the benefit of doubt.  Listening to this album only proves my point.  This album is so very wrong on almost every level. <br /> <br />Passable is \\"Two Of Us\\" and maybe \\"Mother Nature's Son\\".  The worst: \\"Julia\\", \\"Help\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Let It Be\\".  The others <br />just plain forgettable, if not at times, unlistenable. <br /> <br />I must say, however, this album is a slight, very slight step above the truly horrible, Pete Frampton \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" movie, \\"In My Life\\" George Martin tribute.(How can any one possibly take an album with Celine Dion and Jim Carrey as a \\"tribute\\" seriously???) <br /> <br />Other reviews both on Amazon.com and other sites praise this album as \\"essential\\" or \\"must have\\" for Beatles fans....no, I'd say if you want to listen to Beatles songs, listen to The Beatles. <br /> <br />
B00002DE2L|2.0|I picked up this CD because I lacked a copy of the Four Seasons from my collection, thinking that a full-priced CD from a usually good label like Deutsche Grammophon would yield some good results.  Unfortunately, I was very wrong.      While not the worst version of the Four Seasons that I've heard, it's certainly not very good either.  I never get a sense that the original spirit of Vivaldi exists in these recordings - it seems to be replaced with an overemphasis on seemingly random personal interpretation, which sometimes works, but more often than not it's just distracting.      I also found that there were several technical playing problems encountered in the recording, especially tuning in some places, which also diminishes the quality.  Finally, the sound isn't really that great - it tends not to be as full as I would like for this piece.      It seems from the reviews that several people like this CD, so ultimately it might be up to personal taste, but I would at least caution people to look around at other recordings before they commit to this one.
6305428352|5.0|I won't go into a long diatribe about the plot and the climax of this masterpiece.  Many others have already done this admirably.  You will not want to stop with only one viewing of this film.  Once in a great while, something comes along that touches all of us in one way or another.  Whether it's a movie, song, book, play, etc. you leave feeling better than you did when you before you experienced it.  Anyone who has ever experienced the wide range of emotions associated with children, creating something that you hope will be everlasting, or just life in general, will thoroughly enjoy this movie.  I have watched it many times and will more than likely watch it many more.  I would agree with a previous reviewer when they state that this will become a classic over time and like fine wine, will get better with age.  If you do watch this and don't feel an emotional swing at one part or another, better check your pulse.
6305327084|5.0|This is one of my all time fav movies. Everytime it is on TV, I tune in. On those long Sundays, I pop the DVD in.  <br /> <br />What amazes me is that I always thought of this movie as a \\"Chick Flick\\". Yet, most of the reviews I have seen are from men who really enjoyed this movie. This is a movie that both sexes can watch and relate to.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album is amazing! It sums up the best POP music has offered since the '80s! It has all her biggest hits like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" to her more outrageous hits like \\"I'm A Slave For You\\" and \\"Toxic\\".  If you are a fan of Britney or a fan of POP music then this album is for you. Sure there are a few ballads missing such as \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know\\" but she more than makes up for it with the three new songs! P.S. Britney did an awesome job packaging this album with lots of great pics and even a bonus CD with remixes! Thanks Britney for always giving your fans the best!!!
B0000024IE|1.0|I wish I could put into words the disdain I have for RAP.  But I can't so all you get is the title.  Music?????  Don't make me laugh.
B000089CJI|5.0|Every so often I'll hear an album that totally changes my perspective on music. \\"Give Up\\" was one of these albums. It's a fresh take on electronic music, uncomplicated and beautiful. So very worth listening to.
B00064MW6A|2.0|Unlike X-Men, and to a lessor degree, Spiderman, this film failed to take a comic book character and impart endearing characterization.  For some reason Hollywood often forgets that story is supreme, it doesn't matter how cool the characters are.<br /><br />Most of the dialogue in this flick was corny or clich&eacute; and pretty predictable, and to be frank, if you want to see gratuitous shots of Halle's boobs, get the movie Swordfish.  Nothing here made her character believable or really that sexy, at least in my opinion, and while I think she's a beautiful women, it's hardy enough to base a movie on.<br /><br />In the end, this may be worth renting and watching once, for the curiosity factor, but that's about it.
B000002IQW|5.0|In listening to Skid Row at their \\"peak\\" on \\"Slave To The Grind\\", I came to the conclusion that at all of their respective \\"peaks\\" in their careers, nobody could touch the vocal power and range of Sebastian Bach.  Not even Axl Rose.  The first time I listened to this album, I was absolutely blown away!  To this day, everytime I hear the song \\"Wasted Time\\", I get chills.  It is such an amazingly powerful song.  To further illustrate how powerful Bach's voice was on this album, I don't think there is any lead singer (past OR present) that could wail the way he did at the end of \\"Livin On A Chain Gang\\".  The sheer magnitude and power of his voice on that song blew my mind.  To any heavy metal fan or fan of \\"80s music\\" (whatever term you want to call it - to me it's heavy metal!), this album is an absolute must!  Don't believe me... listen to the sound clips on here and decide for yourself.  Skid Row could have been much more, but the same can be said about a lot of bands.  Just sit back and listen to an album from a time when they were at their best!  A+
B000683VI4|4.0|The Notebook is in a category different from mere \\"chick flick\\". Women I know melt at the mention of either the book or this movie.  I joined my Mrs. watching it last night on Valentine's Day and we both enjoyed it.<br /><br />We get to see Noah and Allie at two different times during their life.  The story takes place largely in South Carolina, except for a brief period in New York and with Noah overseas for World War II.  Allie's family comes from money.  The men all wear white linen suits and have dinner parties in front of mansions with tall white columns.  Noah is being raised by his father over on the poor side of town.  He works in the lumber yard, but in the evenings Noah and his father (played by a vigorous Sam Shepard) sit on the front porch and read Whitman and Tennyson.  Not your typical white trash.  Allie's mother is played by Joan Allen in a wonderfully subtle performance - in one of the best sequences of the film she drives Allie to the sawmill to show her the big burly man she had a mad, passionate affair with 25 years ago, to get Allie to imagine life with a poor laborer years from now.  Allie's father is played by David Thornton, and I don't know the man at all, but I have lived and traveled in the south for decades and NO ONE has a moustache or accent like those he uses in this film. I bring it up because almost everyone I know who has seen this performance find it distractingly unconvincing.<br /><br />James Garner and Gena Rowlands play the older Noah and Allie.  The film is directed by Gena's actual son, Nick Cassavetes, and he cast Mom well.  James Garner is absolutely wonderful, casting a warm glow over all his scenes.  The \\"hook\\" is that the older Allie has advancing Alzheimer's disease and Noah reads to Allie from the Notebook that describes how they fell in love half a century ago so that a brief window will sometimes open and Allie can recognize Noah through her deteriorating dementia.  In an early scene Allie doesn't know her own children, and they beg Dear Old Dad to come home.  James Garner tells them \\"That's my sweetheart in there...\\" and you know he has no intention of ever leaving his sweetheart.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the ending, but have tissues handy.  If you're prone to crying at movies, you'd better have the whole box.ildren, and they beg Dear Old Dad to come home.

B000002KDO|5.0|This album is packed with greatness. My favorite Sabbath song is Lord of This World. Every song is good. The best ones are Lord of this World, After Forever, Into the Void, Children of the Grave, Sweet Leaf, Embryo, in that order. This album has heavy riffs in Lord of this World, Into the Void and Children of the Grave. If you buy any album by Sabbath, buy this one. If you are looking for individual songs then I would go for Lord of this World, Into the Void, After Forever or Sweet Leaf. I have all of Black Sabbath's albums and all of Ozzy's albums. I also have all of Zeppelin and Guns N' Roses albums and I would have to say that either this album or Ozzy's Diary of a Madman is my favorite album with Ozzy in it.
B000063DFN|5.0|Well, to put it into summary, it kicks ass! Powerslave is neck and neck with Number of the Beast for being the best Iron Maiden album. I just hate when a band comes out with such a good album, because no other band out there can come close to topping it and they usually won't release one like it again. But anyways, Aces High is truly one of the best songs, probably the best song on the album, the first two times I heard I really didn't like it, but after that I fell in love with the song. Great album!
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere In Time, Iron Maiden's 6th album, and in my opinion their best up to that year. <br />In the late 80's, metal music was changing, becoming more daring. Bands were implementing new and different instruments for a better sound. This is the album where Maiden did just that. <br />Using guitar-synths, and using them exceptionally well, Iron Maiden released Somewhere In Time in 1986. Hidden in between Powerslave and Seventh Son, this album may be sometimes forgotten, but make no mistake, this album is one of Maiden's best ever. <br />Caught Somewhere In Time comes at you straight away, and already you can hear these guitar synths improving the sound, giving it a \\"futuristic\\" feel. It's a great opening song, but it is only the beginning, as things get even better. <br />Wasted Years is the next track, and one of, if not the best Maiden song ever. The whole song is awesome and catchy and stays in your head for a long time. It is so popular, many other bands have done their own versions of this masterpiece, whether it be for a tribute album, or a part of the band's own album. <br />If you can stop yourself from repeating Wasted Years over and over, the next track is called Sea Of Madness. It's a good song, with the typical Maiden feel with heavy Harris bass. Not the best track on the album, but still good. <br />Heaven Can Wait comes next and it's another top song on the album. Very popular when performed live, as it gets the fans involved, and it's just as good when listening at home. If your not singing along during the middle part, you're just not a Maiden fan. <br />The next song, The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner, in my opinion, is the poorest song on the album. Although it has great guitar riffs, the structure and the way it is sung always annoyed me. And as a result I could never get into it. <br />The second best track on this album is next, Stranger In A Strange Land. From beginning to end, the song is supurb and a classic. It's everything you want in a Maiden track, with a killer solo too. <br />Deja-Vu is the next track, and again it is rathy catchy and you'll find yourself singing it in your head once you've listened to it. A rockin' track which I think should be included more often in Iron Maiden's live shows. <br />The album ends with a bang with Alexander The Great. An awesome epic track which could stand side by side with Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and To Tame A Land. Simply brilliant. <br /> <br />In my opinion, I think Somewhere In Time is Iron Maiden's 2nd best album out of the 13 studio albums they have done, in terms of best to least best. If you dont have this album yet, go out and buy it right now. <br /> <br />(rating each song is as follows: 0.98-1= killer track, 0.95-0.97= awesome track, 0.90-0.93= very good track, 0.85-0.88= OK/good track, 0.80-0.83= poor/average track. Once you add up the scores, divide by the number of tracks to get the percentage) <br /> <br />Caught Somewhere In Time: 0.95 <br />Wasted Years: 1 <br />Sea Of Madness: 0.90 <br />Heaven Can Wait: 0.95 <br />The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner: 0.85 <br />Stranger In A Strange Land: 1 <br />Deja-Vu: 0.92 <br />Alexander The Great: 1   = 7.57, divided by 8 (tracks) = 94.6% <br /> <br />
B000063DIH|5.0|All right, I'll admit, this may have not been up to the same caliber as Powerslave or Number of the Beast it still holds a place in Maiden History. The title song is unforgettable and holds an extremely catchy tempo and songs like Childhoods End, Judas my guide, and Be Quick or Be Dead are all good. Be Quick or be Dead, while the song itself if fair, the intro is one of my favorite intros I've ever heard. And Wasting Love, while Bruce singing soft may be strange, when the song gets to its heavier parts it is really good, you have to hear the whole song.
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden's 1st album, way back in 1980. It's where it all started for this mega huge metal band. <br />Before Bruce Dickinson, there was Paul Di'Anno. There was no Nicko McBrain on drums, nor Adrian Smith on guitar. Apart from original members Steve Harris and Dave Murray, on drums was Clive Burr and on guitar was Dennis Stratton. <br />Iron Maiden released their very first studio album in April of 1980. As far as debuts go, Iron Maiden's was fantastic... <br />Prowler starts off the album, what a beginning. A rockin' tune which still gets played in live Maiden sets today. Remember Tomorrow is next and this track is also a great song, slow erie guitars at the start followed by fast solos. <br />Running Free is next, another track still played live. It's one of Maiden's early songs which people always remember. It's just a fun track. Next up is the instrumental track Transylvania, which is pretty good. Following the instrumental comes Phantom Of The Opera, some say the pinnacle of this album, and their not far off. It's a classic epic Maiden track, the start of many more to come.  <br />Strange World comes next, in my opinion one of Iron Maiden's best ever songs. The sound you hear at the start and throughout the song is mesmerizing. The drums, the bass guitar and the wonderful soft voice of Di'Anno makes this song perfect. <br />Sanctuary is next, another fun rockin' tune, which is still popular to this day and was performed live in Maiden's last live album, Rock In Rio. Charlotte The Harlot follows and is another one this albums better tracks. A foot-tapping classic, which Maiden re-recorded as a B-Side on a single for their Seventh Son album.  <br />And to finish off this wonderful debut album, is Iron Maiden. It's the band just telling everyone who they are, their battle cry...as they say \\"Iron Maiden's gonna get you\\". <br />(rating each song is as follows: 0.98-1= killer track, 0.95-0.97= awesome track, 0.90-0.93= very good track, 0.85-0.88= OK/good track, 0.80-0.83= poor/average track. Note, instrumentals are not included. Once you add up the score, divide by the number of tracks to get the percentage.) <br /> <br />Prowler: 1 <br />Remember Tomorrow: 1 <br />Running Free: 0.90 <br />Phantom Of The Opera: 0.97 <br />Strange World: 1 <br />Sanctuary: 0.87 <br />Charlotte The Harlot: 0.92 <br />Iron Maiden: 0.88   = 7.54 divide by 8 (tracks) = 94.3% <br /> <br />In my opinion, the album Iron Maiden is ranked 3rd out of Maiden's 13 studio albums, in terms of best to least best. This is a must have for any Maiden fan. <br />
B0000844M8|5.0|\\"Born Free,\\" is an absolute wonderful film.  It's beautiful, about a couple who take care of a lion cub whom they love and nurture and name Elsa.  She is smart and they love her like a child.  But also they want her to be free and never to be put in a zoo.  It's a very emotional and moving film.  I'd give it  ten stars it certainlty desrves it.  It's a true story based on a book.  Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, real life husband and wife portray a married couple in the movie too.  They are wonderful actors first rate.  They make the performance moving, sad, and happy.  They capture all the moments.  Elsa is also a star in the movie.  She's very sweet and a gentle lion who doesn't hurt anyone, because she's been raised since a cub by humens.  The tile song alone adds much more emotion too the film and helps tell the story and tell it's theme.  It's a beautiful and inspiring song.  I'd highly recommend this film to anyone. There are some flaws too from the time period it was made and the wrong and unfair treatment of Africans as servents. <br />But the rest of the film is good and the scenery in Kenya is breathtakingly beautiful.
B000063DI8|4.0|No Prayer For The Dying, Iron Maiden's 8th studio album. If anyone has read my review on Fear Of The Dark, you will understand how this album ties in with their follwing one. After a huge tour for Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, I felt that Iron Maiden were worn out, tired mentally and physically. It showed more on Fear Of The Dark, but it was on this album where you could start to see a few changes.<br /><br />Guitarist Adrian Smith calls it quits in early 1990, before this album was made, but a song he did co-write beforehand did make it to the album (Hooks In You). Enter new guitarist Jannick Gers.<br /><br />What I noticed from this album are the more simpler lyrics/music, and the shorter songs. Gone are the long 6-9 minute epic tracks we've heard in the past. The longest song on this album is only 5:32. But despite all that, they seem to get away with it due to great songs and few fillers. This indeed is an underrated album.<br /><br />Tailgunner starts off this album, and it's a great opener. Reminds you of Aces High, but nowhere near that classic song. Great solo and great guitar riffs. Holy Smoke is next, and here is where we see the lyrics change a bit from what we are used to hearing. The song itself is good and these different lyrics would continue later.<br /><br />The title track comes next, a semi-ballad which speeds up for a brilliant solo towards the end of the song, another standout track on this album. Public Enema Number One follows the title track. Nothing special here, just a typical Maiden track, but it just works. It just gets better as it goes on.<br /><br />Fates Warning is next, again nothing special and is just an OK track. I've noticed that almost all the tracks so far all have the same type of structure and most go for the same length of time, which I think is the result of their tiredness. For Iron Maiden, these are easy songs, without too much creativity or challenge, yet with most of the songs, they get them to work.<br /><br />The poorest track on the entire album is next, The Assassin. It's totally a filler and disappointing that master song-writer Steve Harris is the one who wrote it.<br /><br />Run Silent Run Deep is next, one of the best songs on the album so far, along with Tailgunner. The erie beginning is a great start, with a galloping thundering riff throughout the track makes it a standout song.<br /><br />Hooks In You would be the 2nd of the OK to average songs on this album. It's another song where the lyrics are quite different, and it's only the catchy chorus which saves this track.<br /><br />The best song of the album is easily Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter. A crowd favourite and always played in live shows, the song is an instant Maiden classic.<br /><br />The album finishes off nicely with Mother Russia. In the vein of To Tame A Land & Alexander The Great, Mother Russia is a fitting end to this album. With Russian type guitar sounds during the verses, the song is catchy and leaves you satsified.<br /><br />Overall, although this is no way Iron Maiden's best album, and it does seem uninspired at times, it is an underrated, good album, where they do seem to get away with making great songs and working them well. In parts, especially with lyrics and song structure, I believe Iron Maiden were wearing thin, tired from long and lengthy tours and No Prayer For The Dying shows that in parts. It shows even more with their following album, Fear Of The Dark.<br /><br />(rating each song is as follows: 0.98-1= killer track, 0.95-0.97= awesome track, 0.90-0.93= very good track, 0.85-0.88= OK/good track, 0.80-0.83= poor/average track)<br /><br />Tailgunner: 1<br /><br />Holy Smoke: 0.92<br /><br />No Prayer For The Dying: 0.95<br /><br />Public Enema Number One: 0.93<br /><br />Fates Warning: 0.90<br /><br />The Assassin: 0.85<br /><br />Run Silent Run Deep: 1<br /><br />Hooks In You: 0.88<br /><br />Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter: 1<br /><br />Mother Russia: 0.95  = 9.38 divided by 10 (tracks) = 93.8%<br /><br />Give this album a go, you'll either like it or hate it...<br />
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|In the Bourne Identity we meet Jason Bourne who is an amnesiac but always responds to bad situations with instant calm decision and action. If you play the DVD of that movie with the directors commentary on you can hear that he was very careful to generate this casual superman persona. <br /> <br />In the Bourne Supremacy we meet Jason (man on the street) Bourne, he's a bit handy but he's not so sure of himself and he's a bit more regular guy. Gone is the instinctive certainty and the casual ability, now he's the troubled and thinking type, more your average guy caught up in something he doesn't understand. <br /> <br />The Bourne of the second film couldn't climb down the embassy wall in the first film, but then he'd never have escaped the initial contact with the security guards.  <br /> <br />Then there's the style. This shaky camera stuff is a cheap BS technique with no future. If your eyesight broke up like that when you ran we'd all have to walk all the time. The human eye-brain link does a marvelous job of smoothing motion, faking the jiggly effect back in should have been a film school experiment that never saw general release. What's the point of watching a film I can't see? So this one is getting a \\"not interested\\" rating and maybe I'll watch it while I read a magazine (so I don't have to put up with the shaking) when it reaches Starz and Encore.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Here is another great movie starring Will Ferrell.  Overall this was a well thought out comedy.  It has all the elements: jokes, bad odors, and as always a love story. Anchorman was set in the appropriate era because everyone loves the bad clothes and bad hair of the 80's.  Will Ferrell always seems to surprise me with his odd humor.  Some of the things he says are totally out there, but they are hilarious.  The addition of Christina Applegate to the cast was a big success; it was a surprise to me to see her in a comedy role, but in the end I was very impressed.  All of the characters did a great job portraying their characters.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes odd humor!
0316172324|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this short and engrossing book.  It was a great read, and once started, I could not put it down.  Blink refers to snap judgments (really reactions more than judgments) particularly where these reactions have life or death consequences, such as a policeman deciding to fire his gun.  In the tragic case of an innocent person being killed by four New York cops, there was no decision, no judgment, only reaction, a bad reaction in this case.  In the case of the Getty Museum getting duped by a fake 2600 year old statue, the true experts immediately knew that the statue was fake, and their reaction was good.  Gladwell makes useful points, such as :  That the blink can trained and cultivated resulting in better reactions;  that expertise and real experience usually results in better blinks; that if the situation is intense enough, many physiological systems shut down - including hearing,  and bladder control; that additional information can actually lead to a worse decision by bringing in nonconsequential factors; being reflective in sports hinders performance and often a superior athlete gives the wrong explanation of what he's doing; that trained readers of faces can do a much better job of sizing up a person instantly.  The story about Silvan Tomkins handicapping horses by looking at their faces was fascinating.   <br /> <br />Why the \\"but\\"?  Well, I'm not sure that Gladwell is properly trained in this area and has the academic credentials to qualify as an expert in this area.  Also, a lot of this is obvious, such as a trained expert would make better snap decisions than an ignoramus.  Nevertheless, Gladwell is a fabulous storyteller, and he provides a great deal of things to think about.  The points he makes are supported by beautiful real life stories, told in an artful manner.  This is the heart of the book.  If you don't read this book, you'll be missing out on a real treat. <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|Growing up, I listened to Pantera heavily.  It inspired me to become the person I am today.  This album is one the greatest metal albums of all time.  Cowboys From Hell Forever.  From a one Texan to another...R.I.P. Dimebag.  You will be missed.
B000000WF9|5.0|This soundtrack caputures the emotions and mood of the film perfectly. It is wonderfully composed and adds to this drama flick. The film, while not heavy not heavy in special effects, is more like the classic Hitchcock or Bradburry flicks, with a deep and full story, using scifi as a backdrop for the story. A terrific film and soundtrack. One of the best, underrated films of the 90's.
B000002H33|5.0|This is the best of all of 'Tallica's albums.  Although I agree that Kill was the quintessential thrash album (along with Slayer's Reign in Blood), Puppets shows a sense of maturity among the band.  Cliff brought out the best in James, Lars, and Kirk.  Everyone complains about their new stuff, but I feel it is them maturing.  Besides, 'Tallica always tried to vary their sound from album to album and not be narrow-minded of the music they make.  (Unlike other bands who keep the same sound all throughout their careers and never grow musically.  But before people think I am talking about Slayer, I actually love the band.)
B0002OERI0|5.0|Okay, so I am a hardcore Greenday fan.  I have every single cd they ever recorded including Kerplunk.  I am really pissed that people are getting upset that they are finally getting the recognition they deserve.  It doesn't upset me that my 10 year old little sister is singing \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" every five seconds.  It upsets me that she doesn't know any other of their great songs.  My favorite has always been \\"Macy's Day Parade\\".  And people say that they were never political before and why should they start now.  Well because Bush is a moron and somebody needed to say something.  And they actually have the power now to make a statement.  All in all, this is one of their best albums and they deserve it.  They have been around for more than 12 years and it is time that they got a wider fan base than just 20 year old \\"hard core punk rockers\\".  Who by the way don't really exist.  They died when The Sex Pistols broke up.  So I just want to say, shut up.  You don't always know what you are talking about, Green Day is really good, and no they didn't sell out just because they got famous.
0553582453|5.0|This is the second book in The Tawny Man trilogy (after Fool's Errand, and before Fool's Fate).<br /><br />With Dutiful's safe return to Buckkeep, the castle is now abustle with the prince's bethrotal to Elliania, the Outislander narcheska, which will seal the peace treaty between the Six Duchies and their past enemy.<br /><br />In the political background, there's a lot going on. Despite Queen Kettricken's efforts, the case of the Witted folk is far from being resolved, with the Piebald extremists still keen on getting people's attention by all means necessary, including denouncement and murder. To crown it all, a delegation from Bingtown arrived in the middle of the bethrotal festivities to ask for help in their conflict with the Chalced States. And strange veiled emissaries from the Rain Wilds have started to speak of dragons. The Outislanders threaten to end the peace negotiations if Kettricken agrees to help the Bingtowners.<br /><br />This all leads to Dutiful blundering one evening, involuntarily insulting the narcheska. To prove the good will of the queen and prince, she'll dare the latter to slay the legendary dragon Icefyre, which lies imprisoned in a glacier on the island of Aslevjal. Dutiful has little choice but to comply.<br /><br />So Fitz, who's posing as the Fool's (or should I say Lord Golden's) servant and bodyguard under the name of Tom Badgerlock, has got a lot on his mind too. Knowing his mastering of the magic is rather limited, he reluctantly agrees to become Skillmaster. Indeed, Dutiful will need the help of a Coterie in order to fulfill his quest. But where to find other potential members?<br /><br />Meanwhile Fitz's foster son Hap is now apprentice to Gindast. But it isn't long before Svanja, a girl from town, turns his head away from the wood-worker's workshop.<br /><br />Whereas Fool's Errand was set mainly in the countryside and forests of Buck, in The Golden Fool, most of the action takes place in Buckkeep castle and town themselves. So much happens, so many twists and turns, it's tremendously exciting! I got lost in the labyrinthine secret corridors of the keep, and I was as eager as a kitchen maid for the latest gossip. There are wonderfully exhilarating passages, such as when the Fool, Dutiful, Chade and Thick unite to save Fitz, or when connections with the Liveship Traders trilogy start to become obvious. I don't know how to explain this feeling, but I know that only Robin Hobb's books get me intoxicated with such glee!hemselves. So much happens, so many twists and turns, it's tremendously exciting!

B000092ZYX|5.0|God, this is my favourite Radiohead Album. 14 songs that I love, and yet they're all different from each other. It's electronic; it's rock; it's experimental... Every song has its story and is special. Thom Yorke is not crazy, crazy would be to had kept hidden such an extraondinary secret as HTTT is. The tracklist is a wonderful continuity of songs that will have an effect on you. It is not as sociopath as Kid A or as dark as Amnesiac... Every thing in Hail To The Thief is melodic, intelligent, and Thom's voice will always stand out. I wouldn't go as far as to say \\"Radiohead at their best\\" but I certainly have to tell you this Cd is a gem if you know and understand this unique band. \\"There There\\" makes me wanna cry for its beauty. Other of my personal favourites are \\"Backdrifts\\", \\"The Gloaming\\" and \\"Wolf At The Door\\", that has the gorgeousest rap lyrics as you'd never heard before. Besides, this is a record that grows on you. If you like the previous albums, you without a doutb won't be dissapointed.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Normally, I love Tim Burton films (except for Planet of the Apes), but this one left me painfully disappointed.  Basically, McGregor's failed attempt to speak with a Southern accent ruined it for me, particularly since Albert Finney (who plays Edward Bloom in the later years) is a native Southerner and speaks accordingly.  The end result: it was extremely hard to believe that McGregor and Finney represented two stages in the life of one character... In fact, they appeared to be two totally different people.  Nevertheless, I have to admit that the set design was fantastic.
B000000WCV|5.0|Five Stars because there isn't a song of this CD that I don't like. I bought this CD only knowing the songs \\"Around The World\\" (a brilliant and sticky electro song that makes you wanna dance, and has a cool video directed by the genious Michel Gondry) and \\"Da Funk\\" (once again, strong beats, a danceable tune). I bought it being a little bit afraid of finding in it songs like in their other album, \\"Discovery\\", which has a focus on the melodys rather on the beats and rythm. I played \\"Homework\\" on my CD player and I was amazed! It had really deep sounds, and if I played it really loud, it would sound like I was in my own private disco... I loved it, and still do. It's a wonderful record, and I don't regret having bought it. It's not monotonous at all: it has nice evolutions, and you hear very little of vocals, unlike in \\"Discovery\\". \\"Homework\\" is old school and rocks a whole lot!! =D Every track is excellent. 16 songs to blast and dance!
0553213105|5.0|I was supposed to read this in high school.  Didn't happen.<br /><br />Then I was supposed to read it in college.  Again, didn't happen.<br /><br />It's about a bunch of girls sitting around a drawing room, right?  Probably noteworthy from a historical perspective, but what does it have to do with me, or with the 20th or 21st century?<br /><br />Everything, it turns out.  And strangely enough, I should have seen that just from the title: this is about how pride and prejudice make us blind to the things under our noses.  It is about how, in our closed mindedness, we sell others, and consequently ourselves, short.  And it is about how we deny ourselves happiness in this asinine fashion.<br /><br />Notice that I don't say \\"this is about how Elizabeth, the heroine . . ..\\"  Certainly Elizabeth is guilty of the sins that form the title of this book, but Austen cleverly allows us to make the same mistakes as Elizabeth does, and being human, we make them.  Admittedly, we come around to the truth quicker than Elizabeth does, but I think that that only makes it more obvious what our mistakes have been.  We sit, watching Elizabeth agonize over truth, wondering if this careful, intelligent, strong young woman will ever figure it out, and we reflect upon ourselves: where have we been proud?  Where have we been prejudicial?  Whom have we sold short, and what has been the result?<br /><br />So there is a moral, but equally important is that neither the story nor the author preaches to us.  We are free to draw our own conclusions, though what those conclusions are is obvious, for most anyone with half of a brain.<br /><br />Of course, all of the good moral in the world is useless without a skeleton of prose, but how marvelous this prose is.  I would say that the novel is worth reading for this prose alone, even without the moral, but the two are not even intertwined, they are the same: Austen's genius is to show us Elizabeth's life, and convince us that it is a mirror of our own life: 200 years later we're still making the same mistakes, celebrating the same victories, living the same lives, and it's always nice to read about ourselves.<br /><br />So yes, it's about a bunch of girls sitting around in a drawing room.  And it has everything to do with the here and now.<br /><br />(A little aside, for those who wonder: how did I ever read this book?  I read somewhere that Patrick O'Brian's (author of the Aubrey/Maturin books) favorite author was Jane Austen.  Even more, I read that the comparison of his work that most pleased him was to Jane Austen's work, so I figured that there had to be something to this author, after all - and not just something from the point of view of high school literature class.)
B00005NZBN|5.0|BUT, the song, 'I Was Young When I Left Home,' and although it was recorded in 1961, is one of the most heart wrenching, achingly, beautiful recordings I believe Dylan has ever done.  Whoever chose to put it on as a bonus track, thanks.
0385336950|2.0|I found this book by searching on topics related to the Japanese balloon attacks in World War II.  Being a reader swayed toward non-fiction I thought it may be good to read a fact-based fiction novel as this is advertised.  Unfortunately the story wrapped around the facts is complicated and boring.   <br /> <br />Despite the plot issues, the writing itself can be very good at times.  It was enjoyable to read the well written descriptions of the Japanese balloons like; \\"If you've ever been that man on the ground, you know there is something about the silence of a balloon in flight that consumes you, that renders everything around it silent, as if the balloon's magic included not only flight but the ability to swallow sound.\\"  The portraits of Great Alaska are also exceptional and seem to come from a man who has lived through an Alaskan cycle of all day light and all day dark.  Unfortunately the uncomfortable cobbling of an awkward asexual love story with the unreachable world of native spirituality is really confusing.  Much of the time I found myself wondering if Belk (the main character) was dreaming or living the sequence being described and could not stitch together the actual story the author wanted me to see.  I understand that mysticism leaves unanswered questions, but in the end the reader wants to know the story.  You can't help but want to scream at Belk to take control of his life and his emotions by jumping Lily and killing his Col. Kurz (Gurley).  You also want to tell off the author for the length and complexity of Belk's torture, but your really not sure how much he endured and how much he dreamed.   <br /> <br />Near the end of the book I found myself hoping for more descriptions of the curious balloons as I trudged through the mud of the love story.  In reality I just wanted the story to end so I knew the ending.  I'd read more by this author if he promised to concentrate his story on a more simple thread and leveraged his descriptive ability to enhance the story rather than surround it.

B00004BZ0N|4.0|Punk or not, who cares?  It's music, and good music at that.  I got a copy at the public library and copied it at home.  I've listened to it several times.  It's a fun album, energetic and crisp, but it's not as good as everyone on here says.  A bit over-rated, I'd say.  Some of the songs are stupid.  If you grew up with this album, of course you're going to love it.  The music in the late 70's/early 80's sucked, so of course this album is going to stand out as a masterpiece.  But compared to stuff that came before and after it, it slips in the rankings quite a few places.  But hey, considering what's being produced these days, this is excellent stuff.  Music sucks so bad these days!  Same with TV, movies, books...the list goes on and on.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Kill Bill, vol. II (Quentin Tarantino, 2004)<br /><br />The general consensus among fans is that vol. II of Kill Bill is not quite as good as the first (based both on reviews and its standing as I write in the IMDB top 250-- 93 as opposed to 58 for the first film). There is, of course, a vocal minority who violently disagrees. Allow me to add my voice to the minority.<br /><br />The main criticism of the second film, that it's not as well-paced, is well-taken. I think that would probably have been forgivable to more people if the film had been released as one piece; since I watched them back-to-back, I probably didn't feel the effect quite as acutely, either. Be that as it may, there is so very, very much to like about this film that I ended up liking it quite a bit better than vol. I.<br /><br />Michael Madsen plays insane, psychotic, extremely damaged characters in Quentin Tarantino films. (Anyone doubting this has never seen Reservoir Dogs, a movie Madsen's character stole right out from under at least four other Oscar-worthy performances.) He continues the trend of not only serious damage, but movie-stealing, in Kill Bill as Budd, a man who gets very little screen time given the duration of the film, but who has the most memorable character for all that. Madsen plays his character as a man of quiet malice who's gone to seed, but still sees himself as being a man of quiet malice. The part is written with the greatest complexity of any part in the film, and is played perfectly. Michael Madsen once again stamps himself as one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, and it is he, for the most part, who makes vol. II a better production than the first flick.<br /><br />There are other things about the movie that really hit hard, too. Revealing any of them would be spoilers, but let's just say that Tarantino manages a real emotional response without having taken any of the Hollywood shortcuts to get there, and that alone in a Hollywood film should be enough to make the critics sit up and take notice. (To be fair, many of them did.) That a product like this could come out of Hollywood is almost enough to give this overly-cynical critic a shred of hope that, between Tarantino and the epidemic of Japanese horror film remakes making scads of dough, some moron sitting in a CEO's seat at some production company is going to say \\"you know, here's some solid evidence, finally, that the crap we put out is all wrong, and there's a market for really good films.\\" Don't hold your breath, but Kill Bill, vol. II, at least put the idea in peoples' faces. Whether they see it or not is still to be seen. ****gh to make the critics sit up and take notice. (To be fair, many of them did.)

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I'm a little confused as to why the rest of the country thinks Napoleon Dynamite is funny.  If you're not from Idaho or Utah, half the jokes probably won't even make sense.  I guess there's a certain sort of charm that the movie has, but I know that if I wasn't familiar with the Idaho/Utah/Mormon culture, I would think the movie is even dumber than it really is.  The first time I saw Napoleon Dynamite in the theaters, I didn't really like it.  Then I got the DVD as a gift, and enjoyed it much more the second time.  I guess I didn't have any expectations the second time, and the characters take a little time to get used to.  The DVD commentary fetaures the director and others talking about the movie.  Watch it and you'll see just how weird we Idaho/Utah folks are.  The movie is instantly quotable, and proves that a money-making movie can be made without profanity or sex.  The DVD is worth buying, because there's a short, independent film called Peluca on it that Napoleon Dynamite was based on.  The short film is hilarious, more funny than almost anything in the actual movie.  The short is pretty stupid too, but you can't help but laugh.  I still don't understand how this movie got so big.  It's unique and funny, but it's far from being a masterpiece of filmmaking.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill, vol. I (Quentin Tarantino, 2003)<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino's long-awaited fourth film finally ended up released in two parts. I'm not sure why; the four-hour debacle Dances with Wolves got a theatrical release, and was a smash hit, tying up screens that could have been put to better use showing static for months. So someone finally comes along with a good four-hour film, and the Weinstein brothers decide it needs to be cut into two films. Silly of them.<br /><br />In the first part, we meet The Bride (Uma Thurman, who previously worked with Tarantino in Pulp Fiction) and the five people on her hit list (though we meet two of them more fully than the other three). The first film concentrates on giving us part of the backstory and showing The Bride's assassination attempts on the first two names, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu of Ally McBeal fame) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox, recently of the Lifetime TV series 1-800-Missing). As usual, the thought goes through the viewer's head: \\"Where on earth does Tarantino come up with these names?\\" We may never know.<br /><br />As I write this, the film sits at #58 on IMDB's top 250. As is usual with movies in the top 250, I don't think it deserves a spot there, but it's certainly a nice piece of work. It's both homage and parody at different times, and Tarantino is a talented enough director that we know which parts are which, and any blurring between the two is intentional. The pacing is immaculate (another reason this could well have worked as a single four-hour piece), and the story is given to the viewer just quickly enough to keep the curiosity alive. Very good stuff, well worth watching. *** ½
B00067BBQE|5.0|i thought that this dvd was incredible. i would recommend it for any evanescence fan, or if youre looking for new music and dont know where to start...start here! truly amazing dvd set in the zenith in paris, and you get a look at the true evanescence behind their hardcore facade.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Its, in my personal opinion, the best radiohead album and definitely the most talked about. Not only OK Computer is radioheads cathedratic musical achievement as it also contains some of the most impressive melodies of the 90?s (at least) to go along with the inspiring vocals. And Why? Cause its simple in a complex way, it speaks to the heart in the abstractness of lyrics letting the listener flow through the waves of its conscious! I can remember, i can imagine, i can simply sing along but sometimes i cant help the deep breath. This is me, this album is to me, to us, to every listenner - they (Radiohead) are letting it all out again and it comes from within - we can tell! It speaks beyond the lyrics. From the messages in it, the one i mostly remember is that nowadays we are so distant from each other. Thats no surprise...afterwall, happinnes can be so terrifying!
B00005JMEW|3.0|This film was good...although this feels like it should have been a part 2 (tarantino I believe already had volume 2 partly done and partly thought out). I don't know why but this film feels slightly rushed.Bascially you have a woman, who was going to get married but got brutally battered and left for dead by a bunch of assains. Waking up after a 4 year coma she vows revenge. The music in this movie was good (classic stuff). the hanzo sword scenes weren't bad but not as good as part 2. You have a little comedy, a little sass, and a lot of attitude. I read a few reviews were people misread the animation scene (cause there is one and it surprised me cause you don't expect it in a film). Anyway some were saying it was porn. There was no sex, no talk of sex, and no sounds of it. So how can someone see it that way is a mystery. My only guess is those people didn't actually see the whole film (you know how some are, they see 2 seconds of a one hour film and want to give a review).
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Home is the lovely song Michael Buble penned for that someone special on one of his frequent world tours.

You could knock me over with a feather after I listened and hung on each and every word it's so good.  <br /> <br />My parents and my daughter are all Buble fans now - who says good music isn't still available! <br />My dad tells me that Under My Skin by Sinatra wasn't as good as Michael's version - quite the compliment coming straight from a long time Sinatra fan....!
0812548094|2.0|I made it through Wizard's First Rule and rather liked it and sought to continue in the series.  The first book was often slow and tried to avoid arriving at any conclusion to any matter, but the story and the chacacters interested me greatly, so I moved on rather quickly.   <br /> <br />Stone of Tears, the second installment of the series was an obvious choice for my next read.  Alas, it presently sits half read in a box as I wait for a point in my life so boring as to make me want to finish the book.  If it weren't for the fact that I was involved enough in the story to not want to toss the book entirely, it would likely have been given a mere 1 star.   <br /> <br />Goodkind has a wonderful imagination, and I don't doubt that some people will find his writing style energizing, and others just love the characters enough that they'll embark on the epic journey of reading this novels to share in some of the pain that their beloved characters endure.  When I some day finish this novel I would probably give the third installment a try as there have certainly been interesting moments in the tale Goodkind weaves.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, these stories lack urgency and as a result are not compelling.

0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond has given an impressive account of why complex civilizations and technology emerged on the Eurasian continent rather than other locations.  Noting that many earlier writers have suggested an innate superiority of the population, he argues persuasively that it was in fact an accident of geography.  In essence, as Diamond shows with solid evidence, the earliest civilizations in the Fertile Crescent area (roughly Iraq and parts of Syria) enjoyed unique advantages due to a large number of easily domesticable plants and animals.  Domestication of plants and animals spread out from Iraq to other areas both East and West, giving Eurasia a jump start in technology.  Technology, population growth, and urbanization interacted and reinforced each other to produce the combination of guns, germs, and steel that ultimately resulted, about 9,000 years later, in Europeans conquering the rest of the world.  Along the way, he offers provocative answers to questions such as why European diseases devastated the native populations of the Americas, Polynesia, and Australia, but no diseases from those regions did real damage to European settlers.    I should also note what this book is not, since negative reviewers here and elsewhere seem not to understand it.  First, it isn't an explanation of why specifically Western European countries rose to global dominance.  This topic is discussed only for a few pages, and only in the epilogue.  And even then, the discussion is entirely a contrast of Western Europe vs China.  Other outcomes that were at least hypothetically possible, such as global empires arising from India, Japan, or Korea, aren't even discussed, nor are such questions as why England thrived for centuries as an imperial power while Spain, with wealthier conquests, rapidly became a hollow shell that merely looked like a powerful empire on the map.      It also isn't an argument that geography is destiny and culture is meaningless.  Consider this passage from page 252: \\"Traditional New Guinea has conservative societies that resist new ways, living side by side with innovative societies that selectively adopt new ways.  The result, with the arrival of Western technology, is that the most entreprenuerial societies are now exploiting Western technology to overwhelm their conservative neighbors....  The Chimbu tribe proved especially aggressive in adopting Western technology.  When Chimbus saw white settlers planting coffee, they began growing coffee themselves as a cash crop....  In contrast, the Daribi, a neighboring highland people with whom I worked for eight years, are especially conservative and uninterested in new technology.  When the first helicopter landed in the Daribi area, they just looked at it and went back to what they had been doing; the Chimbus would have been bargaining to charter it.  As a result, Chimbus are now moving into the Daribi area, taking it over for plantations, and reducing the Daribi to working for them.\\"    The above passage illustrates a point with an example from New Guinea.  Diamond has lived for many years in New Guinea, performing research largely into bird populations, and has a clear fascination with the place.  He starts the book with a question asked by a native New Guinean and a dedication to numerous Guinean friends; he returns there for discussion or examples in almost every chapter.  Generally history on this global scale is written from a heavily Eurocentric or perhaps American perspective; Diamond's unique 'New Guineacentric' perspective adds to the appeal of the book.    \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is skillfully written.  Certainly it isn't light reading, but it is hard to imagine how a study covering such a broad subject matter, and analyzing in comparable depth, could have been more readable.  I strongly recommend this book.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I got hooked on Gilmore Girls around season three, if I recall, so naturally bought both seasons 1 and 2 on DVD in order to catch up. This show couldn't be more perfect.  The cast is tremendous and they all work together with machine-like precision.  Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop (daughter and mother) are particularly noteworthy because it seems there are many mothers and daughters who have this sort of love-hate relationship, filled with issues that never quite get resolved over the course of years.  Bishop as the rich, pretentiously formal mother is so convincing that I'd probably be visibly shaken were I to see her in jeans in a coffee shop eating bacon and eggs. And Lauren Graham?  What's not to like?  She has given life to one of the truly unique characters in TV history as the daughter who just won't buy into her parents' lifestyle and controlling ways.   She delivers her lines with such rapid-fire perfection that one wonders how she can ever \\"come down\\" from playing this role for over 100 episodes at this point. (Her character is always drinking strong coffee, which, if it's the real thing, may help explain a few things.) And those cross-references! Strange, exotic trivia comes out of the mouths of some of the characters as fluidly as if they were simply saying, \\"Have a nice day.\\"  That adds an element of fun to the show, in my opinion.  Having just aired their 100th episode in early February 2005, some wonder how long this show can sustain itself.  In my opinion, the creators are smart enough to know when it's time to say goodbye, but, meanwhile, a \\"weak\\" Gilmore Girls episode towers above most of the predictable junk on most TV channels.  <br />
B0001AP12G|1.0|NOT impressed.  Not a single song on the entire album is listenable for more than a few seconds.  I'm so tired of artists being hailed for their \\"complexity\\" and for \\"keepin' it real\\", when their songs have all the aesthetic appeal of a 3 day old turd.  Compare this to something like TLC's \\"Crazy, Sexy, Cool\\"... An album that will go down as one of the greatest ever.  But as for Kanye? YAWN...
1400043662|4.0|As a cat lover, I found this book disturbing. After all, who is this Johnnie Walker fella who's hobby is to kill cats? Is he really Kafka's father? Anyone who loves Murakami knows that his tales are full of twists and turns, enigma and loose-ends. Kafka on the Shore is no exception. If you've not become a fan already, then you might be annoyed that there is no clear cut ending but if you're happy to go with the flow, to be swept along by a series of inventive characters then you will find this a compelling work. <br />But interestingly there is a way to unravel a little bit of the mystery. <br />It's worth knowing that the cat-killing sculptor is based on a real Johnnie Walke who lives in Tokyo. If you know the man, you can begin to understand the connections within the novel. And to do that, you could read (insiders tip here) pages 186-89 of Extremes: Contradictions in Contemporary Japan by G M Thomas. Walker is described here in some detail. <br />(And isn't this a literary first? For a real person to appear in a novel and a non-fiction book in the same year?) <br />But back to the book. There are the usual Murakami favourites like teenage sex but whilst this may not be one of his best it should none the less be read.
0671027387|2.0|This book was a tough one for me. Having been a fan of the Davinci Code, I was expecting a lot more out of this book. Instead not only did I read a fairly boring and unoriginal book, it also had the most ridiculous, unbelievable ending of any book I've ever read.<br /><br />The first third of the book was incredibly boring. I was nearly tempted to stop reading but fortunately, Brown picked it up the pacing and suspense the last two thirds. But the gaps of logic throughout the book were obvious and distracting. The characters were fairly flat. No character really changed or had any epiphanies. The president is a good guy (albeit extremely naive for a President of the United States). His opponent is power and sex hungry. And of course there's the stereotypical special ops team who tries to take out even more stereotypical characters like annoying scientists. But if that wasn't enough, the ending of the book is enough to make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />*** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br /><br />At the end we discover that the president's opponent calls a press conference to announce that the meteorite NASA discovered is fake. Instead the packets containing this information is easily swapped for packets containing photographs of the president's opponent having sex with this top aide.(This would have to the first modern day presidential candidate who didn't have a PR staff to help him at a press conference - hence allowing the scandal to unfold.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, the \\"meteorite\\" containing fake extraterrestrial life is conveniently dropped from an airplane to the bottom of the ocean and forgotten about. Never mind the fact that this is the biggest \\"scientific discovery in history.\\" No one is going to ask to examine it. Instead everyone is going to be focused on the sex scandal and forget the meteorite.<br /><br />Ha ha ha! The joke is on all of us who were unfortunate enough to pay money for this crummy book.

B00008YJHC|3.0|I'm a huge Pixies fan, but this album has never really appealed to me as a whole like Surfer Rosa, Doolitle, or Trompe le Monde do. Maybe it's beacuse those albums seem to work as a whole - Bossanova just seems disjointed to me. There's plenty of good songs on this album, but as a whole it doesn't match up to the rest of their catalog.

0385510454|2.0|If you are a Grisham fan, you have to read this book.  He has written some great novels in the past and that forces you to want to read The Broker.  Problem is, its not very good.    In a 350 page book, Grisham spent nearly 200 pages developing the character.  There was a weak storyline built in to those pages but it wasn't until the last 100 pages that he half drew you into the story.  At that point it picked up a little in pace.  The end of the book was OK but far from spectacular.      Since I have read every other Grisham book, I had to read this one and I'm sure I will read the next.  As for the review, if you are a new Grisham reader, don't start with The Broker.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|I am not weak and I like movies that can emote remote depressive feelings in me. Somehow this movie with absolutely impacting dark nature didnt manage to entertain me. Sometimes our sub conscious mind exerts extreme nightmares on our brain and there are times when we feel we just came out of the worst feeling ever.<br /><br />I have once felt the same feeling of drowning within yourself and yet everything being more unreal than comprehension. I have not seen a more dark film in my life. The best way to describe it is \\"black\\" owing to its extreme....<br /><br />A certain character in the film rots in the worst way. A fridge can be extreme torture. I really felt emotionally sick while watching those scenes. However  I somehow could not contain myself in that period of time where I saw the film.<br /><br />PLEASE READ:<br /><br />However I noticed a lot of people liked this film but in my (not)humble opinion, watch this if you know what addiction can do and are willing to see something of as dark nature as this.<br /><br />Enjoy what works
B0000669JL|5.0|Jamaicas' most gifted musical artist was undoubtedly the legendary Bob Marley. Bob Marley and his dynamic backing group, The Wailers, became the sound of Jamaica. Marley also deservedly became the undisputed and unparalled king of reggae music, defining new styles that set standards in todays musical culture. His untimely death left a big void in music.  <br /> <br />Legend (1984) is just a mere skimming of their greatest work together but for casual fans this perharps is the definitive collection of Bob Marley and the Wailers. This compilation was issued by Island Records that featured many other renowned reggae artists.  <br /> <br />The vast majority of songs captured on this one disc were written and produced by Marley. He indeed proved to be something of a musical genius with his reflective outlook on life. Marley explored various themes through his music with some being profound love songs whilst others containing more of a political theme, exploring relevant social issues of the time.  <br /> <br />Is This Love kicks off this unforgetable collection. Is This Love pretty much sets the tone for the duration of the album. The warm, jamming reggae arrangements contains Marleys' distinctive vocal style where he puts in a subtle yet powerful performance.  <br /> <br />His remarkably unique vocal style is put too full accelerated effect on an electric and stunning live performance of that divine classic, No Woman, No Cry. This legendary classic is perharps one of Marleys definitive landmarks.  <br /> <br />Much of Marleys music makes for fantastic late-night listening with its mellow, atmospheric tone and also makes great house-party music, creating the right ambience thats relaxed yet literally makes you have to get up and dance! The jamming Could You Be Loved is a pure example of this. Could You Be Loved is one of those great numbers to groove too and is infectious within its complex, multi-layered reggae arrangements to Marleys raw, earthy delivery.  <br /> <br />Marley proved to be a highly versatile vocalist and surprisingly made a great ballads singer which is perfectly demonstrated on the exotic, and sensual Three Little Birds. This timeless classic is a masterpiece! Three minutes of pure perfection!  <br /> <br />The fabulous Buffalo Soldier is another number that makes you just want to get up and groove the whole night through. Marley seamlessly surfboards along the startling musical arrangements, carrying this classic off with a lot of verve and style.  <br /> <br />Bob Marley and the Wailers music never once really escaped its urban feel and welcomingly so as their music remains a refreshing alternative as what they always remarkably were was origanal. The urban mode and almost stark effect on the compelling Get Up, Stand Up is just contagious. Though you could argue some of their recordings become slightly formulaic they never once get boring and were just magical from beginning to end with Marley always being an upmost genius for creativity.  <br /> <br />There are far mellower and laid back numbers included such as their early 1970's classic, Stir It Up which becomes almost hypnotic as the musical arrangements career along at an easy, relaxed pace. They go in for that more traditional Jamaican sound on the sensational One Love/People get ready which is given startling recognition from the shimmering backing vocals courtesy of the Wailers to Marleys vibrant, up-beat, feel-good performance. More grittily earthy was another bombastic classic, I Shot The Sheriff, which, like most of the other tracks on here, enjoyed phenomenal chart success across both sides of the Atlantic.  <br /> <br />Marley shows off his seemingly effortless flair again on the magical ballad Waiting In Vain. His musical vocal style still has that uplifting quality but yet conveys a more sensitive, yearning sound thats both exciting and soothing.  <br /> <br />Theres a more spiritual and poignant edge on the atmospheric classic, Redemption. The minimal orchestrations are fully ignited by forceful, aggressive vocals from Marley. Redemption commendably conveys Marleys diversity and unchallenged artistic integrity.  <br /> <br />Equally as mellow as Redemption is the exotic-flavoured, Satisfy My Soul which is complimented by another effectively laid back performance from Marley amidst the flowing, theraputic arrangements. However more exciting musically was one of his biggest, all-time best classics - Exodus. From that compelling opening through to the funk-driven rhythms and marleys impeccable delivery. Exodus is pure dynamite and emerges as one of the biggest highlights on this all-rounded excellent compilation.  <br /> <br />Legend (1984) then winds down with another of his all-time greatest and most infectious creations, Jamming. My point about Marleys music making great house party music and simply making you want to just get up and dance, will give you an understanding of what I mean when listening to this divinely funky number that ends the album on a high.  <br /> <br />Bob Marley and the Wailers enjoyed staggering chart success in Jamaica and amazingly their music became a world wide phenomenon. They enjoyed deserved mammoth chart success throughout the 1970s with their string of albums that were rightly perceived as pieces of musical art by critics as well as many of their singles occupying the higher reaches of the charts. Marley remains one of the key influential singers of our era and as far as reggae music is concerned, he has never been bettered and casting my own rather biased opinions aside, doubtfully ever will! Long live the king of reggae!  <br /> <br />Ian Phillips  <br />
1400034779|4.0|This book is a great read and a great escape from the usual, predictable novel. This was a Christmas gift from a friend in Scotland and I thanked her for introducing me to a new author.  <br /> <br />I have ordered the following 3 books and plan to savor them.
B000002KHB|5.0|Machine Head is one of Deep Purple's greatest albums.  It opens with one of my favorite tracks, the thundering &quot;Highway Star&quot;, and just rolls on after, through hits like &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin'&quot;, and some lesser-known tracks like &quot;Pictures of Home&quot; and &quot;Never Before&quot;.  I would definately recommend to any hard rock enthusiast.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I remember the exact moment when I understood Radiohead. Riding shotgun in my brother's car 'let down' was playing, I could only make out glimses of what Thom was singing. But what hooked me to this song was the emotion and fragile beauty that almost seemed defiant. From that moment on I lost interest in the metal music I liked before and pop music felt so superficial and dead to me.   <br /> <br />OK Computer is a complex and challenging musical affair that requires repeated listenings for it soak in. I suggest listening to it with headphones on with lyrics in hand. It's theme really captures the aspect of alienation and dehumanization that modern technology and bureaucracy has brought to society. Technology has slowly seperated humans from each other. The feel of OK Computer is of an athiest wishing he could believe in God, an existentialist hoping there is more to our strange existence then sex, work, and death. I now understand what Thom's emotion was defying, the heartless rationality of a society moving away from Nature, towards materialism, and whose chief interest is efficent production of all the wants people have. <br /> <br />As for the music Jonny Greenwood is an amazing guitar and keyboard player whose uniqueness and originality of style embodies musical genius. This has been my favorite album for about 5 years now and these songs can still bring me to tears.
B000002WCJ|5.0|Well, it's a contender for that title. Helloween's third album, 1988's 'Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 2,' is by far their best and a staple of German metal and power metal. Everything about it is good. The production is good all around, with plenty of emphaisis on every instrument. Michael Kiske has never sounded better.<br /><br />However, one key component is this: to really get the most out of the record, you need to know more than just \\"I Want Out.\\" Sure, it's a great song, one of Helloween's best in fact, but it's not the whole album. For one thing, \\"Dr. Stein,\\" the second single off this album, is another of the band's greatest songs ever. The solos, particularly the organ one, are absolutely terrifying, in a good way. Then, there's the frantic speed metal of \\"Invitation/Eagle Fly Free\\" and \\"Save Us,\\" where Kiske's voice is more bone chilling than ever (especially on \\"Save Us.\\") But the one song that turned me on to this album was the epic closer, \\"Keeper of the Seven Keys.\\" The song has everything. It's long, it's epic, and it has a wide variety of riffs. It starts out a la Queensryche's \\"Take Hold of the Flame,\\" then slowly evolves into one of the hardest, fastest songs Helloween have ever recorded. Overall, this album is highly recommended (I have recently ordered it, and I have heard the entire album, for my friend owns it on his Mp3 player.) It truly is contending for the title of the greatest power metal album ever.
0743490304|4.0|Another quick read from Dan Brown.  Once again I felt like I was in a classroom taking a very exciting course.  Brown would be a very good professor if he ever decided to offer a curriculum on some of these topics.  The main character in this story is Rachel Sexton who is a White House Intelligence Analyst working for the National Reconnaissance Office.  She is also the daughter of Senator Sexton, who is the leading candidate for the opposition party for the Presidency.  Sexton's main platform for his campaign is that NASA has a monopoly on space and that they greatly overspend their budget every year.  For the amount of money the public puts into this institution Sexton believes they should be getting a greater return.  He believes that maybe some of the private sectors could do better.  Even with these assaults on NASA by Sexton in the press however, current President Zach Herney has continued to be a great supporter of NASA even though it is ruining his chances for reelection.  When Rachel is called to the White House to meet with the President, she doesn't know whether she is being called on for her analytical skills, or if as her boss director William Pickering had warned, that since she wasn't getting along well with her father since her mother's death, that the President might try to use her as a pawn against her father.  When Rachel arrives however, to her surprise, the President seems like a nice guy and only wants her to verify the authenticity of a find NASA has made in the Milne Ice Shelf of the Arctic Circle, a discovery that if true could justify all of NASA's spending and ultimately guarantee Herney a second term in the White House.  She is then whisked away to the Arctic along with a group of independent scientists to verify the finding.  One of the independent scientists is an oceanographer named Michael Tolland who has his own television show like Jacques Cousteau, and he develops into Rachel's love interest over the course of the book.  One of the other scientists, Corky Marlinson a biologist, is used effectively for comic relief.  While Rachel is in the Artic she and the other scientists unravels some disturbing evidence about the find and have to try to escape with there lives while the truth is being covered up.  The biggest question is then trying to figure out who has enough influence to be behind all of these cover-ups.  The suspects then start to build up.  The head of NASA it appears must be in on it, and the President's main advisor, the cigarette smoking Marjorie Tench also appears very guilty, but does the corruption travel all the way to the Presidency itself?<br />In this story Brown seems to play both sides of the fence on the issue of NASA.versus the Private Space Industry.  I believe the truth lies somewhere in between however.  I believe NASA should stop working at a loss, and that some of these private companies should be given some of the contracts.  The monopoly of space (if there really is one) should be ended.  We just need to regulate these things properly to allow for the private sector to safely go into space while maintaining NASA's main goals which should be in science.  Our future lies out there.  How we get there however is still open for debate.<br /><br />This book was only written in 2001, but already some of the information about NASA having a monopoly on space is a little outdated.  Just this past year (2004) I witnessed a new space race in the private sector that caught my interest.  I loved the $10 Million X Prize challenge that was to be given to the first private entrepreneur who can put three people into suborbital space and do it again with the same equipment within two weeks -- and do it by the end of this year (2004).  The X Prize is modeled on the $25,000 Orteig Prize that Charles Lindbergh won for crossing the Atlantic nonstop in 1927.  Practically overnight following this, the narrow public perception of the airplane as a weapon and a stunt device expanded to embrace air travel as something for Everyman.  The X Prize serves to \\"to create a business model,\\" to show that the private sector can fly to space for only a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars that it costs for a NASA space shuttle mission, or even the estimated $20 million that space tourists Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttlesworth paid to ride on the Russian Soyuz.  At the moment, the leading X Prize contender is Burt Rutan's team (Team Rutan), but there are a half-dozen others close behind, especially the Canada-based Orva Space Corp., who are the developers of the \\"Da Vinci Project\\" (I'm sure the Dan Brown fans will find this ironic).  It features a giant, helium-filled balloon that will release a rocket 80,000 feet above Earth for a burn into suborbital space. Burt Rutan, who gained widespread renown in 1986 when his Voyager became the first aircraft to circumnavigate the globe without refueling, estimates that commercial suborbital flights could cost $30,000 to $50,000 \\"initially,\\" and as little as $7,000 to $12,000 in a \\"second generation.\\"  The \\"prize model\\" has also drawn interest from NASA, which is now trying to use similar competitions to enlist private know-how in overcoming hurdles posed by President Bush's proposal for exploring the moon and Mars. \\"We see prizes as a good way to do that,\\" said Brant Sponberg, program manager for Centennial Challenge, NASA's prize initiative. The agency has asked for a budget of $20 million for it in 2005. Sponberg is contemplating contests including \\"land ten kilos [23 pounds] on the moon very cheaply,\\" and \\"develop a system to land very precisely on the moon or Mars\\" without a satellite navigation system. \\"I'm sure there's some genius kid out there who can probably figure it out.\\" he said.<br />In Washington Senator John McCain who is the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, has also had several hearings on the commercialization of space, and members of Congress are examining current legislation dealing with the commercialization of space and proposing amendments to it.<br />Another big topic in this book is whether or not life originated on Earth?  The book makes reference to a real NASA discovery in 1996 named ALH84004.  This a rock that appears to be from Mars that was found in the Arctic and has the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  This could be considered evidence of bacteria fossils, and they are much smaller than any found on Earth, and if verified could be considered Proof that there was Life on Mars.  According to the Panspermia Theory (or Cosmic Ancestry), which is the belief that life originated elsewhere (possibly on Mars), bacteria or spores were used to populate the Earth with amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, which then evolved into all the species.  If this finding could be validated it would lend great support to this theory.  Since the rock was in the Artic for 13,000 years the find is currently being dismissed due to the question of contamination.  We won't know for certain if it is proof unless another rock like it is actually found on Mars.  The next NASA trips to Mars are not planned until 2007 to obtain a sample.<br />Brown also touches upon a few other advances in technology in this book that were very interesting.  He mentions Nano Technology, which are tiny robots that can make other robots or perform a programmed function, and Biomimics, that imitate nature.  By studying how to imitate nature, scientists created Velcro, and are currently working to mimic spider webs, solar power, and limb replacement similar to that used by salamanders.  Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) which are Microbots, are also described in this book are some of the up and coming technology that supposedly will be used more prevalently in the real world.<br /><br />By looking up some of the topics in this book I also found some very cool sites.  The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) site was a verygood one that I would recommend.<br /><br />Very educational while being entertaining at the same time.dealing with the commercialization of space and proposing amendments to it.

B000002N3N|5.0|The problem with Enya is that she is so consistently good.  It is difficult to write a review that says something different from previous reviews (having recently reviewed \\"A Day without Rain\\" and previously \\"Watermark\\").  The same words, ethereal, ephemeral, airy, haunting, and spiritual apply to each album.  The only risk is that my reviews become boring, because Enya could never be.<br /><br />This CD begins with the instrumental track \\"The Memory of Trees.\\"  While \\"The Memory of Trees\\" is nominally an instrumental, there are voices that punctuate portions of the music.  This opening feels optimistic, though the title feels as though it is vaguely related to forests and lands gone by.  The vocals provide a chorale sound that builds and cascades around you with the feeling of great trees and landscapes greater than any of the puny works of mankind.  Great beasts wander about and smaller beasts enter and exit the brush at the edges of clearings in the great forest in a celebration of nature.<br /><br />The pace speeds up in the peppy \\"Anywhere Is.\\"  The lyrics are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental images.  As is frequently typical of Enya the lyrics seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escapes your grasp.  In this case the song seems to be describing the paths we take in life and the choices that we make, and whether they can be unmade, and even whether the choices take us to or from the one we love.  Another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instruments which compete for attention with Enya's voice.  Typically Enya's voice stands out clearly from the instruments, which in this case are mostly strings and piano.<br /><br />\\"Pax Deorum\\" is somewhat ominous, and fits with the following song, \\"Athair Ar Neamh.\\"  Both songs are simple songs that relate to God.  \\"Pax Deorum\\" translates roughly as \\"The Peace of the Gods,\\" or seeking to placate the gods.  \\"Athair Ar Neamh\\" translates approximately as \\"Father in Heaven.\\"  Note that the title of the latter song appears as a line in the former song, tying both songs together, and placing an Irish Gaelic line into a Latin song.  There are moments of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous \\"Pax Deorum,\\" which I believe has appeared as the background music for a commercial.  The latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and Enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the Irish Gaelic verses.<br /><br />\\"From Where I Am\\" is a relatively sedate instrumental that forms a brief piano interlude leading into \\"China Roses.\\"  This song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song.  This song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally.  Once again Enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the strings and piano to create a work of aural art.<br /><br />\\"Hope Has a Place\\" is the first song where the lyrics are relatively easy to understand.  The concept is simple: there is always hope where there is love.  The vocals are beautiful (again) and may remind a listener of the song Enya wrote for \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  This song is for romantics and candle-lit dinners everywhere.<br /><br />Another instrumental interlude follows.  \\"Tea-House Moon\\" has some of the most interesting instrumental effects on this CD.  The mood is contemplative and traditional, though with a vaguely Asian flavor.  This instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography.<br /><br />The next song changes style, again, and yet fits within the character of the album.  \\"Once You Had Gold\\" seems to allude to the transitory nature of all things, perhaps most particularly life.  There are lines that seem to say that things come and things go, and you need to accept the joys that you can get just from being here to greet the new day.  I particularly like the last line which says that there are no promises in life, that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation.  The song is sung in a fairy tale style, a cautionary tale young and old.<br /><br />The next song translates as \\"The Dreamer.\\"  The music tells you all you need to know about the words, which are surrealistic and, of course, dream-like.  The ephemeral lyrics and music bespeaks an atmosphere, a feeling, a place that can only exist in our dreams, though we might wish otherwise.  This song nearly achieves allowing us to be a creation of our imagination.<br /><br />At last we must awaken from the fantasy Enya has woven for us.  \\"On My Way Home\\" returns us to this place and time, but with a longing for the place we leave, the poetry that has been woven for us.  Yet, we rejoice for we return to a place of familiarity, and still, there is the memory, yes indeed, \\"The Memory of Trees.\\"s sung in a fairy tale style, a cautionary tale young and old.

B000002KBA|5.0|This is Deep Purple's first hard rock album, and it doesn't slow down for quite a while.  It opens with the amazing &quot;Speed King&quot;, which people say isn't really a good song, but just play it and listen to the play between Ritchie Blackmore's guitar and Jon Lord's organ, as well as Ian Gillan's piercing vocals.  Some other tracks worth mention (as if they all weren't) include the haunting &quot;Child In Time&quot; and some rather unknown, but really awesome, tracks like &quot;Flight of the Rat&quot;, &quot;Living Wreck&quot;, and &quot;Hard Lovin' Man&quot;.  Definately pick this up if you like Deep Purple and/or some truly great hard rock.  I would also suggest Machine Head if you don't already have it.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a longtime.  Sure, it was a little corny in parts.  Like when he's singing to his dad or when he asks the girl in the store on a date, but you have to love the corny parts.  Plus, it's so funny.  I love when he asks if there's any maple syrup, and then he pulls it out of his sleeve.  My sister can quote that whole scene perfectly.  I also love when he runs into his father's boardroom all excited about having a date, and then he calls the one guy an elf.  I think this movie shows that you don't have to have dirty jokes and all that crude humor to make people laugh.  It was clean and wonderful.  Plus, the acting was awesome.
0812550706|5.0|Whenever I talk about this book, it's hard not to make it sound like I am a science fiction junkie. I love and defend sci-fi, but I am not limited to the genre. Neither, I think, is this magnificent book. To label it simply a sci-fi classic would be like labeling \\"Moby Dick\\" a great book about boats. All great books, regardless of the genre, say something truly profound about the human condition.  <br />\\"Ender's Game\\" not only manages to have a strong message, but it is also a joy to read. The plot is enthralling, the characters are complex and realistic, and the descriptions of the battleroom fill your head with fantastic images that make you wish your school had been like this, without the burden of saving humanity. The subplot involving Valentine and Peter is superb and cannot fail to inflame every reader's megalomaniacal side. Though the book is about children, it never condescends and gives kids the credit for the intelligent creatures they are (a big plus for teenage readers). The characters are exceptionally bright, but they are still identified as five- to twelve-year olds, not as mini-adults. It's no wonder that so many gifted young readers have made the statement, \\"I am Ender.\\" I hope \\"Ender's Game\\" is able to make the rare crossover from lowly sci-fi to recognized, so-called \\"legitimate\\" literature. <br /> <br />Not only will you not be able to put the book down, you won't be able to read this book just once.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I've heard many things about this film. Comments by my friends that is was cheesy, simplistic, or that it felt like an old school film.  Of course, the current mindset of America is to have ultra realistic  action in movies.   <br /> <br />I'm young, but I can still appreciate films that pay homage to the old school films of the '50s where stuff like that was what people actually believed could be.  It was a rather innocent age, back then. <br /> <br />If one looks at the film realistically, one would scoff the robot designs- they did look like big toys, non-menacing (to what we are used to nowdays at least) and totally non-feasible in a mechanical sense.  But that's where people go wrong.  They assume things have to be real to be enjoyed. It was fun, just for those few hours, to be immersed in that old America, where people's imaginations told them that this was the future.   <br /> <br />Also, the idea of a mercenary force called in to investigate \\"because the world's army's were occupied\\" is also rather silly.  I don't think it's possible today, or ever, that nations would allow a mercenary force that size to exist, much less operate inside a nation's borders.  But that's looking at this movie all wrong. <br /> <br />The story itself is classic sci-fi.  The dashing hero, the perky newspaper reporter, the tough female officer, and even the motivation for the bad guy is classic sci-fi.  Nowdays, villains do their evil deeds because of selfish reasons, revenge, or just to kill.  Here, we have a villain, who thinks he is doing the right thing.   <br /> <br />If anything, this film deserves to be recognized for doing something that's never been done; using only CG to create this world.  It's simply amazing to think that everything you see is CG.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|SAW is just brilliant.... i was in awe the whole time... i like the fact that the killer is really not a killer he is just a kidnapper that gets people because they dont appreciate life... its true people dont cherish life like they suppose too (but that is another story).     i have never seen a movie that made me think about it for days... i was thinkin that the same thing could happen to me... and that is the scariest part of them all...     not to ruin the movie but the people in the movie basically are the killers cause the jigsaw puzzler is  a puzzle wizard and gives the people time to solve it or its too late...    overall this is a movie i will cherish for the rest of my life.... i have never seen a movie like this and iw will reccomend this movie to anyone.....if they are into movies like this......    5++++++++++++: pure brilliance!!!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|sun ra, can, talk talk, brian eno, aphex twins, portishead, even louis armstrong... put them in a blender and add the key ingredient (radiohead's innovative -albeit more accessible than their influences- ways), and you get something like Amnesiac... this album is done brilliantly... Kid A and Amnesiac are by far the most innovative records to come out in the past 5 years... even if you can't fathom this record, at least acknowledge the amazing effort put into this... from ambient to electronic dance to rag-time era jazz, this is a genre jumping (and yet so uniform sounding) record full of small gems... beautiful melodies (just listen to \\"Packt Like Sardines...\\"), wonderful and at times odd electronic-tinged vocals ...this is post-rock at its absolute finest...radiohead has embraced and transcended their influences and created two perfect post-whatever albums ...this album is full of small gems (whereas Kid A is definitely more monumental)... my pretentions aside, i would suggest this record to anyone...
B00005JM02|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theaters probably a little over a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago, and I wasn't expecting much actually. I fell in love with the movie, though.  I must admit, I'm not a big animated movie sort of person.  Sure, all the Disney movies are great to watch with kids, but there are only a few animated movies that I would watch by myself.  This would be one of them, along with Lion King,the first Toy Story, and maybe a few others.<br /><br />This is a funny movie.  I love all of the fish.  They have such great personalities, and they are so unique.  You have to fall in love with them right away.  I would highly suggest this movie to anyone of any age.  I think you will really like it.
B000000993|5.0|These guys are amazing. Starting with the lead singer Maynard James Keenan. This guy can hit the high notes and just use his voice in ways that are truly magnificant. Thats not even boasting. The drummer is all over the place, this guy has great hands, very rapid and rhythmitic. And to top it off, the bass and guitars. Very eerie, and dark. Progressive metal at its finest. My favorite song on this cd is probably \\"undertow\\". Maynards lyric writing is great, well put together. There not to tough to figure out and at the same time there not easy either. Maynard makes it a point to tell you he's not religious in the sense. Lyrics are definitely not hear-say. Every track on here has its own special sound and part in it that makes you wanna listen to it over and over. To say they are overrated is an understatement. I'd say there not talked about enough at all. I only started listening to them this year, 4 weeks ago. They were simply a choice on my bar jukebox. I figured out who they were in a rather strange way. I asked a guy shooting pool what the name of the song it was he played and he was drunk as crap, he replied \\"uh i dont know, \\"sober?\\".lol. Ironic maybe?. Very good lyrics on sober. These guys are amazing. I listen to all sorts of music. And there starting to become my favorite. Check them out, you wont be disapointed
B00005JM0B|4.0|This is a great movie. Although it is not as good as Terminator 2: Judgement Day, it is still a good one and worth to see. Arnold is the all time best as the character of the terminator. Nick as John Connor is also memorable. So, it is still a good one overall.
B00029LNHS|5.0|This album gives a very intersting sound.  \\"Hands Up\\" was an oaky opening, but could have been better.  \\"Labor Day is a really good song, like most of their songs, well written, and very catchy.  Their first two songs have a lot of hip hop and jazz elements, and that works for them.<br /><br />\\"Lets Get Retarded\\" instantly became my favorite song.  It was very catchy, and very addictive.  Great to listen to, and great to work out to.  A fun fast paced song that meshes well with all of its elements.<br /><br />\\"Hey Mama\\" I heard for the first time long before I even heard of the Black Eyed Peas in an Apple commercial.  Its a great, catchy, fast paced song, and one of my favorite.<br /><br />\\"Shut Up\\" I heard this song in that XM commercial with the Alfa Romeo; this CD is heard everywhere, and it is also a great song.  The vocals are really impressive in this song, and is very catchy.<br /><br />\\"Smell Life Funk\\" I didn't really like that much.  It was okay, but it really didn't go with a lot of the album.  This song didn't really stand out as a great song.  The same goes with \\"Latin Girls\\", \\"Sexy\\" and \\"Fly Away,\\" even though \\"Fly Away\\" has been used in various ads.<br /><br />\\"The Boogie That Be\\" I've heard many times in various TV promos, and other things like that.  It is a very funky song, and I like.  It doesn't stand out as a great song, but its fun to listen to.<br /><br />I didn't really like \\"The apl Song\\" musically, but it was a greatly written song.  It had a lot of emotion, and it was good for that, but it was almost so well writeen that it was depressing.<br /><br />\\"Anxiety\\" is an AWESOME song.  It features Papa Roach, and is by far one of the best songs on the album.  The song was well written and very catchy, and Papa Roach made this song really cool.  My second favorite song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Where is the Love\\" features Justin Timberlake for the chorus, and what actually got me to listen to the album, even before hearing the Apple commercial.  This is a great song, and very well written.  It is kinda political, but showed us how angry this world has become.<br /><br />\\"Lets Get It Started\\" is just the radio version of \\"Get Retarded,\\" I guess some found \\"retarded\\" offensive, and decided to change the name and lyrics slightly.ple commercial.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|First let's see if you want to buy a Megadeth album.  Megadeth was one of the first thrash metal bands, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Metallica.  All four of these bands released their debuts at about the same time and all of them sort of had the same fast, light, thrash metal sound (Megadeth made Killing is my Business).  After these first four albums the bands each found their own sounds.  Then Dave Mustaine, the leader of Megadeth, went on to make  peace sells, and so for so good so what, and, this bvery album, Rust in Peace.  <br /> <br />I recomend this album to anyone that's a fan of any other Megadeth, except if you only like Risk (and no other megadeth) then you might not like this album.  But anyway, anyone who likes  Slayer, Anthrax, Metallica, Pantera, Death, Sepultura, Judas Priest, etc. etc. (basically anoyne who is into classic metal) will love this album.  <br /> <br />If you want to get into Megadeth because you heard its good or for any other reason, then this is the album to buy.  If you can't get this then Killing is My Businness or Cryptic writing is good.  But this album, Rust in Peace, shows everything that Megadeth is made of, and if you don't like it, you probably won't like any other Megadeth album.  This is always the album I recomend for my friends to get first if they want to get into Megadeth. <br /> <br />I only give 5 stars to the Bands best CD, like Slayer's Reign in Blood, and this is Megadeth's best.  It is very fast like the first three CDs, and not like when Megadeth slows down in everything after Countdown to Extinction (even though they are slow, they are still awsome, BUT no AS good as the first 4 albums).The most talent goes into this album, and it influences MANY thrash metal bands to come.  Even though my favorite Megadeth album is Killing is My Business, this is the best. <br /> <br />Every song on this CD is awsome, including two of the best Megadeth songs ever written Holy Wars and Hanger 18, except for Dawn Patrol.  That, im sorry to say, is the one weakness of this album.  Megadeth brings amazing riffs and solos to every song.  It's definetly a clasic in the history of Metal. <br /> <br />Now the question comes whether to buy the old CD or this new remastered one.  I've read the reviews that say that Dave messes up the vocals on this one and it makes it sound a lot worse.  Even though Dave DOES change some lyrics, who cares?  These people are complaining about him CHANGING the lyrics.  But they don't understand that the are JUST AS GOOD. And it's only for one or two songs anyway. About him changing his voice a little bit, yeah it's true, but I personally think it sounds better than the original, and without a doubt the guitar and drums sound way better.  So I say definetly go for this album.  Everything is clearer, and it's the way Dave Mustaine really wanted it.  Also the packet is way cooler than the old one.  You are not missing out on anyhting if you dont have the old one, dont worry. <br /> <br />I'm really sick of poeple saying \\"this is a MUST GET\\" for every dam album I look at, so I dont say that on my reviews except for the ones that I really think are a MUST HAVE for a metal colection.  So trust me here when I say that this album is a MUST GET for your collection if you are a fan of metal or want to get into metal. <br /> <br />Hmmm if I wanted to compare it to another album, probably Ride the Lightning by Metallica.  But it's realy hard to compare beacuse Megadeth brings it's own sound into the Metal World.  A really cool thing about Megadeth is that usually Metal bands have awsome guitar, drums, bass, and vocals, BUT the lyrics aren't always that great.  Megadeth, though, is one of the few bands in the metal Genre that has truelly good lyrics.  Megadeth has won awards over the years for its lyrics, just in case ya don't believe me about that. <br /> <br />I will conclude with a few words of wisdom that I leave on most of my reviews and that is to NOT BUY THE BEST OF BEFORE YOU BUY THE ALBUMS.  Especially not for Mgadeth.  The best of has pretty bad songs on it.  So again if you're starting out with Megadeth, this is the CD to buy, and if you want to continue your collection of Megadeth and you don't know which to buy, This is it.  I promise. <br /> <br />
020530902X|5.0|Anyone who thinks Strunk & White are championing mere functionality over artistic merit clearly hasn't read \\"The Elements of Style\\" very carefully. Nowhere do the authors dissuade the would-be writer from trying to write literary prose; indeed, they single out for special praise such prolix and idiosyncratic writers as Faulkner and Updike. Their purpose, rather, is to get the novice writer to pay attention to what he is doing, to avoid vagueness and cliche. True, the book is pitched mostly at undergraduates who haven't yet learned how to construct intelligible sentences and coherent paragraphs; but nothing in it militates against an elegant literary style. Those wishing to write in such a style should certainly go beyond Strunk & White and seek out more detailed treatises on rhetoric and ornamentation--but not before mastering the basics contained in this extremely useful and sensible little book.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I saw The Mars Volta when they opened for A Perfect Circle in 2004.  The first thing most people notice is that they play through an entire set without stopping.  I mean it is just 50 minutes of raw talent up there with the enigmatic riffs and Cedric's crazy antics to boot.  I am SO READY for Frances the Mute, heard the Widow and I think it kicks ass, so yay for incredible music that is created by bands who do not sell out!!!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|What a movie! This movie is funny, interesting. Also, it is exciting in the last part. Will and James both act perfect in this movie. Also, this is a christmas movie, very suitable to play it during this time as it matches to the chirstmas holiday. Although the dvd released almost one year after it played on the cinema, this movie is still good. Recommended! :)
B00008OLYN|5.0|Why do poeple keep saying this is poser metal!  This is not metal at all and isnt trying to be!  This is a all acostic album period.  So people buying this album thinking it is metal stop complaining and tell your friends to stop telling people this is metal!  Now Opeth IS A METAL BAND!!!  Every other album by this band has METAL RIFFS GALOUR!!!  This is an experimental album that i think is very good and well done.  The musicianship this band posseses is amazing!  Now please dont buy this album thinking it is metal!  Opeth is not your tyical death metal band either!  None of there songs are about death at all!!!  They are not sell outs either.  Their first album switches back and forth from Heavy to Soft!!!  And if you listen to RAP please dont listen to this and give it a bad review, just like i wouldnt listen to RAP (being a rock lover) and give 50 cent a bad review!!!  And STUPID people stop saying that Limp Bizket, Good Charlot, Blink 182, is metal!!!  No its not!!! And I'm sorry but they didnt start Metal either!!!  And Slipknot, My Chemical Romance, Atreu, and all other bands are not metal!!! They are a breed of steeming CRAP that has spawned from pathetic EMOS!!!  And they are what i like to call POP METAL!!!  Metal that little queers listen to because they think their lives are in the toliet!!!
B000001C6M|4.0|Alright.  This is the first album by the great Slayer.  First I'll tell you about slayer to see if you really want to get this.  Slayer, im sure a lot, if not everyone, of poeple have heard of, and most parents think its some band out to polute their kids and most church groups loath it. But when it comes to Metal music, Slayer is one of the kings.  The music hard and loud, with screaming vocals, and squealing solos.   <br /> <br />This album is one of their best, and is personally my favorite.  The best album is Reign in Blood but I like Show No Mercy and Reign in Seasons in the Abyss more.  But that doesnt make any sense you say?  Sure it does.  The most talent has gone into Riegn in Blood with all the lyrics and the way the guitars each make riffs that blend together perfectly. I just happened to like Show No Mercy more.  Even though the talent isn't all there and the band hasn't found their own sound yet, it is an amazing album. <br /> <br />There is really three different stages to Slayer.  The beginning, which this album is in, which lasts for about 3 albums (show no mercy, hell awaits, and haunting the chapel), where the band is playing lighter but very fast music.  Then there is the middle stage of the heavy stuff.  This is where Riegn in Blood, South of heaven, and seasons in the abyss come in.  Then there is the newwer stuff and for any fan of metal or slayer's old stuff, I only recommend to buy God Hates us all and maaaybbbee if you get a chance, you can squeeze in Divine intervention. <br /> <br />If you are into metal or you want to get into metal, get either this, reign in blood, or seasons in the abyss to find out what slayer is made of. But if you are into nu metal like Korn or whatever go check out their new stuff, which im not going to talk about because i personally dont like it. <br /> <br />Anyway back to this album, Show No Mercy. It is a REALLY good album that has a huge variety of riffs and solos.  Almost all the riffs are awsome.  I wil breifly talk about the high lights. <br /> <br />All songs are amazing, except for number four, fight til death, which is a slight let down, but still is pretty good.   <br />Metal Storm/Face the Slayer is awsome because it is like two songs in one switching halfway through, both of which are spectacular by the way.  <br />Black Magic. hmmm. if you ask any slayer fan, they will be upsessed with black magic.  it is one of slayer's best songs in their whole career.  the first time i heard this album and this song came on I was like, \\"Jesus man I'm getting this.\\" <br />Tormenter is my personal favorite song and has an unbelievable riff and chorus. <br />Crionics.  The riff of this song are OK, not great, just ok.  But about three quarters of the way through the song, this solo comes on.  It is one of the best dam solos I've ever heard out of slayer or any other band now that I think about it. It's not so much the talent of it, but the way it sounds.  Its amazing. <br />All the songs that I didn't mention are awsome.  I love this whole CD except for the little let down on Number 4 as I said. oh well its stil worth hearing. <br /> <br />The reason I rated this album with 4 stars is because I only rate the best album of the artist with 5 stars and as I said, even though this is my favorite, it isn't the best. <br /> <br />So What do I recommend about this album? I say definetly get it for your slayer collection.  If you liked the hard stuff at the peaks of their career, you'll like this, and if you like this, then you'll like the hard stuff.  If you like one of classic slayers albums, youll like it all basically until you get to the newer stuf (anything after  divine intervetion).  <br /> <br />I reccomend this CD to anyone who likes megadeths old stuff, metallicas old stuff, anthrax, sepultura, death, pantera, arch enemy, etc.  It's a lot like the rest of the debut albums from Megadeth, Metallica, and Anthrax, but I htink that this is the best of the four.  <br /> <br />Andmy words of wisdom for becoming a slayer fan or a true metal fan, DO NOT BUY THE BEST OF BEFORE YOU BUY THE ALBUMS.  the best of wil just spoil the songs on the albums that are great and the best of usually doesnt have the best songs anyway <br /> <br />This is truelly an awsome fast thrash metal CD, and one of my favorite CDs.
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is the epic tale of a young boy's survival on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. It is an engaging story that hooks readers in right from the beginning and will not unleash them until well after the novel is complete.   <br /> <br />Piscine Molitor Patel, nicknamed Pi, is a young Indian boy who has an amazing knowledge of animals and an attraction for religions.  Pi's story begins in India during the early years of his life.  His father is the owner of the Pondicherry Zoo, and this is the playground that Pi grows up in.  During his time in Pondicherry, Pi begins to worship not only his native Hinduism but also Christianity and Islam-much to the disapproval of his parents, the priest, the imam, and the pandit.   Pi only desires to \\"love god.\\"  This faith and love in God that Pi demonstrates is one of the most poignant themes in the novel and is a direct cause of Pi's ability to survive.  A positive aspect of the book is that even though it contains Pi's feelings on religion, there is no feeling of religious beliefs being pushed on the reader.  Instead, it simply educates the reader about the best ideas of different religions.   <br /> <br />Pi's life takes a drastic change when his father decides to move the family to Canada in search of a better life.  Pi and his family become passengers on a Japanese cargo ship that sinks after only a few days.  Pi is left alone in the ocean on a lifeboat with a zebra, hyena, orangutan, and a Bengal tiger.   Soon, all that is left is the Bengal tiger and Pi.  The 227 days that Pi spends at sea with the tiger take up the majority of the book and are simply captivating.  Every day is a struggle for survival with Pi striving to not only endure the Atlantic Ocean but also the tiger in the lifeboat.   <br /> <br />The humor in the novel is a worthy attraction; often the reader is made to laugh out loud from Pi's descriptions of his first encounter with Christianity, the orangutan's arrival on the lifeboat, and howhe got his nickname.  It provides a light-hearted note to the fight for life that Pi encounters.  <br />  <br /> The novel's organization is also notable.  Most of the chapters are told from Pi's point of view, but some chapters are told by \\"the author\\" who is writing Pi's story. The author's chapters give the reader insight into what is currently happening in Pi Patel's life, often mirroring certain important facts and beliefs that are in the main plot of Pi's story.  The author's note at the beginning of the novel, however, and the chapters with the author's voice give the misleading perception that this is a true story.  In fact, after reading this novel I could not believe that the events were not true.  This is a credit to Martel's wonderful writing.  He creates a story that is extremely imaginative and fantastical, and makes it totally believable.   <br /> <br />Another noteworthy point of the organization of the novel is that it is conveyed in 100 chapters.  This reflects Pi's character in that he strives for order and control.  At the same time it contrasts the name pi, a number that has no order or control.   <br /> <br />  The Life of Pi is suitable for adults and some teenagers.  It appeals to those who enjoy adventure, religious, and bildungsroman novels.  It is most similar to The Old Man and the Sea, not only with the plot, but also in style, as Martel's simple straightforward writing is reminiscent of Hemingway's.   <br />The Life of Pi is a good book that you would want to share with others and discuss with them.  It invites varying interpretations and creates a vast range of emotions in readers.  At one moment you can laugh, cry, be incredulous, joyful, fearful, amazed, and simply spell bound.  The Life of Pi is never boring.  It captivates the reader right from the beginning with its poignant language, and then holds him/her with an adventure that will not let the book be put down.  It provides insight into the human mind \\"the soul-sustaining powerof fiction\\" (according to the front cover).  It is extremely well written and the questions it raises about life, religion, and the depths of human suffering make the readers think about the novel long after they put the book down.   It is not a book to be dismissed.   <br />
B00006J9OT|5.0|I saw Diana Krall on the same European tour at London's Royal Albert Hall, so was looking forward to listening to this.  I purchased this CD a few weeks ago and yesterday put it away on the CD rack for the first time.  However, unlike a lot of other recent purchases, I know this CD will be coming off the shelve many many times in the future.    Put simply, Diana Krall is a highly effective song interpreter, both in her singing and her playing.  I was a little concerned when looking at the song list and the number of pop songs on it - five of the 12 songs here.  I needn't have been.  It takes guts to take really well known pop songs and give them jazz arrangements.  It takes musical brilliance to do so this successfully.  Her interpretation of Bacharach's \\"The Look Of Love\\" is stunning.  When she sings \\"I can hardly wait to hold you...\\" the longing in her voice is passionate without a hint of melodrama.  I have never heard this song performed this beautifully.  Joni Mitchell's original version of \\"A Case Of You\\" was brilliant, one of the best songs on Blue, an acknowledged classic.  Yet fellow Canadian Krall reinterprets the song with great success offering a moving tribute to her native land.  I'm not a big fan of Billy Joel's \\"Just The Way You Are\\", possibly because it's just been overplayed, but Krall's version (the only studio track) is upbeat and magnificent.    The CD gets off to a great start with the jumping \\"I Love Being Here With You\\" which showcases Diana and her band in top form and obviously loving every minute of what they're doing.  There is that feeling of a band just being \\"on\\" that's rarely captured in studio recordings.  Most of the songs have extended instrumental breaks and Ms. Krall really gets the opportunity to show off her chops, as does guitarist John Pisano whose playing is excellent throughout.    Let's be real, if you're preferred style of jazz is avant garde or free jazz, this isn't for you.  However vocal jazz is a legitimate genre and there are few albums in the genre that offer such an irresistable listening experience from start to finish.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie is the best Harry Potter movie so far because the story is good, the actings are good. This movie brings some fresh look to the audiences and me because it talks about some things happen outside of school. Also, towards the end, Daniel and Emma used a coin to go back to the past and this is a new plot. Overall, this is fantastic and recommended at all time.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer is one of the best thrash metal bands and this is their best album.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the cream of the crop.  This album is said to be one of the greatest and most influential thrash metal albums of all time.  And guess what? It is.  Slayer started out light (which sas awsome music), but they eventually got heavy and peaked with this album.  With their squealing solos and satanic lyrics, they took thrash metal to a whole new level. The great things about Slayer are the sound of Araya's (the singer) vocals, the guitars, the solos, and the amazing drums.  If you are into killing and Satanic stuff than the lyrics are awsome too, but don't worry if you're not because I'm not but I appreciate this album as much, if not more, than any other metal head.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this album (and any other classic Slayer albums before God Hates Us All) to any classic metal lover.  Anyone who into anything from Megadeth to Black Dahlia Murder and At the Gates.  And if you're trying to get into metal, well, this is the album, if any, to get.  If you don't like Reign In Blood, you probably won't like a lot of Metal.   <br /> <br />There is a little trick to this album, that somem people need to know.  Some metal albums catch your attention right away, like Slayer's seasons in the abyss or megadeth's Cryptic writings.  But there are albums that don't suck you in right away.  (Pantera is the master at this).  I mean some people get sucked into Riegn in Blood right away, BUT if you are like me and aren't into it a lot at first, but you are a fan of metal.  KEEP LISTENING.  you just have to listen to it a few times, read the lyrics, listen to the solos and riffs.  And I guarantee that you will understand why this is Slayer's most talented work.  There are no albums that are perfect, but honestly, this one comes pretty close, and everyone should agree after they UNDERSTAND it, whether its the first time they listen to it, or after a few times of listeningto it.   <br /> <br />The great thing about this album is that there are NO weak songs.  the whole album is solid all the way through.  Never giving you a moments rest, hehe.  It features Raining Blood, probably one of the best moshing songs ever made, and also Angel of Death, which in my opinion is the best song that Slayer has written. <br /> <br />If I wanted to compare it to another album, probably the talent of Kreator's Enemy of God combined with sepultura's brutality. (BUT keep in mind that Slayer probably heavily influenced both of these bands)  It's a very amazing album.   <br /> <br />And I'm sure that any Slayer fan follows me in saying that at Slayer concerts, its the songs off of Reign in Blood that the band usually saves for last and that the fans absolutely go nuts to.  If  you don't like moshing and \\"raining blood\\" comes on, run for cover. <br /> <br />So if you are wondering about Slayer, and if you like it, get this album.  Second choices are Show No Mercy, Seasons in the Abyss, and South of Heaven.  Basically any fan of metal will like this album.  And if you DO like slayer and you don't have this album already (which I would think very rare) then GET IT! <br /> <br />And my closing words are for you to always stay away from best ofs.  If you care about the band and really want to know their music, never get the best of.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Not only is this the most relevent and well written album of the Year-maybe the last ten years-it is also funny, honest and the best played and recorded punk album of all time. Yes all time. It became my favorate CD the first time I heard and I like it even more every time I hear it. Other reviewer's who say the \\"songs sound like that other band _____\\" or compare the effort to other '70's arena rock band's rock-opera's have missed the point-This masterwork of Punk incorporates most of modern rock that has become before it, includng the band's own style into a perfect recording. Quinten said it well-American Idiot is a concept album-\\"one where all of the songs are good\\"-Awesome,simply Awesome.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|First of all, I have always loved Neil Young's music.  And strangely enough with that in mind, I have never bought one of his albums until this one.  His work with CSNY was always the part of his career that I was most aware of, but until this album I didn't realize just how much depth the man really has. <br /> <br />I'm a sucker for gritty, real, smokey rock that sounds like it's being played in somebody's basement on old acoustic guitars with strum-holes worn in the front cases, on beat-up electric guitars that Pete Townshend whacked on a stage a few times and discarded, through amps with bashed corners and punched-in screens.  Rock that sounds like a sip of cool moonshine whiskey and a drag on a roll-your-own cigarette taste together.  Early Neil Young offers this texture in spades, but with so much talent, soul and spirit-power that he takes it to a higher plane. <br /> <br />The important thing to remember about Neil, is that he is the real thing.  His music is a warm South Carolina night ride through a pine forest with the windows down, with a beautiful long-haired girl who smells like flowers and feels like warm silk sitting in the passenger seat of your '63 Impala letting her hair blow in the starlit night breeze while cradleing a can of Milwaukee's Best between her legs.  Neil Young is edge, anger, love, revolution, heartbreak, shattered dreams and desire.  He is not easy listening.  He is not socially acceptable.  He is not sanitized for our protection. <br /> <br />Thank God for him.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Matt Damon rocks in this movie as an assassin called Jason Bourne. Also, this movie is better than last one because he travels around the world to find out the truth that he was framed in this movie. So, it is exciting and with a lot of tense moments. Good movie, recommended.
B00005AQF7|4.0|The cd is good, but definently not his best. It has a few good songs like \\"Gin and Juice\\" and \\"What's my Name\\", but compared to all the other gangsta 90's westcoast thug rap, this isn't that great.
0446677450|5.0|To say that this book served as my wake up call sounds so cliched, but I cannot say it in any other way. Every concept of earning, saving, wealth, and success I had prior to reading this book were shattered.  <br />Readers will discover that their paycheck is not the road to financial freedom. There is no such thing as job security.  <br />This book pushed me towards starting my own company, becoming an author, and breaking away from my \\"paycheck\\" job. <br />James Green, author of \\"If There's One Thing I've Learned.\\"
B000002HJR|5.0|Down are one of my favorite bands as they play a style of music that I absolutely love. With slow chugging riffs and amazing vocals by Phil, this cd simply is a must have for anyone who loves that southern groove heavy style of music. It just oozes heavy with killer fat riff's and full throttle vocals throughout. It's just awesome stuff really!!<br /><br />If I have one complaint about this band, it's that they don't record near enough material. We need more Down!!<br /><br />Lads, please get on that as the two Down cd's you've already put out are pure gold!!
B000002U82|5.0|This is simply a great album. It's an album you can listen to the whole way through and enjoy every second of it. Perfect for when you're just hanging around, or for long car trips. It has it's loud moments, it's quiet moments, and it's lush, beautiful moments. A must-have.
B0002F7I9Y|2.0|Ray Charles was unquestionably a genius.  And if you want to hear that genius in its purest, blinding white-hot incarnation, across all kinds of different musical styles, buy the \\"Genius & Soul\\" box set (ASIN B00000343O).  Unfortunately, this collection proves that, contrary to the album title, Genius doesn't really get along with company, because (with a few exceptions, like Gladys Knight) the company on this record only waters down Ray Charles's style to mimic their own.  (Bonnie Raitt sounds like she's mailing it in, and the Nora Jones and Michael McDonald cuts are almost unlistenable.)  If you're a big fan of the guest recording artists, then this album will probably be worthwhile, if only for the novelty value.  If you're looking for Genius, keep shopping, and check out the many other worthwhile Ray Charles collections.

B00005K9LM|5.0|This cd is basically Scream For Vengeance 2. It's sounds very similar in a lot of ways. It's fast and furious and it rocks from start to finish. This is really the only Priest cd that sounds similar to other Priest offerings. As the years went bye for Priest their sound and direction was always changing, yet with this and S.F.V. they stayed the course and why not? Why change a good thing? This cd continued on where S.F.V. left off. It's a full blow metal assault and it's great!
0064471837|5.0|Rating System:<br /><br />1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten<br /><br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br /><br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br /><br />4 star = very good; what writing should be<br /><br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br /><br />STORY: Sabriel, daughter of Abhorsen the Necromancer, has to journey into the Old Kingdom and Death itself in an effort to find her lost father and find out why so many towns are falling to the undead.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />My first praise comes from the fact that this isn't your typical fantasy. No elves or dwarves or other \\"cooki-cutter\\" elements.<br /><br />Second praise is due to what the author calles Charter Magic. A form of rune magic, the author creates a form of magic that is powerful but also has its limitations.<br /><br />Third praise is the world he creates is vivid and imaginable. The conflict between the living and the dead is nicely handled.<br /><br />Fourth praise is because the characters were interesting. Sabriel the protagonist I was envisioning as a 12-14 year old but towards the end she says she is 18 years old. Either 12 or 18, she is mature for her age but I understood this to be because of her unique background and raising.<br /><br />Final praise is due to content. Not overly violent or gory and little if no sex. Marketed in several book stores as a young adult fantasy, this was appropriate for teens. I'd rather a teen read this than the content found in the ever popular Drangonlance or Forgotten Realms books.<br /><br />Overall, it was a refreshing read in the midst of the 20+ mediocre books I read last year. This book really hit a note with me and I'd recommended it to any fantasy lover...and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00004TH6O|5.0|not that stoners music is bad or anything, i do also enjoy listening to pink floyd.  QOTSA are one of those rare bands that can rock and play soft music well not soft stoners music very well.  i only own this and songs for the deaf which by the way is one of the best cds of the 00's so far.  these guys know how to rock unlike most nu-metal bands and most people refer QOTSA as a nu-metal which i think that isnt true.  i dont own there self-titled cd but from most reviewers say it is there best cd.  i recommend anyone who likes any type of rock music to give QOTSA a try but if your not openminded to all kinds of rock then most likely youll hate this cd.  this cd is much  better than songs for the deaf so this is the first QOTSA cd id pick up.  i cant wait to see them on there upcoming spring tour and i also cant wait for there new cd to come out March 22nd....later
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I watched this movie when it came out a while ago and I absolutely loved and now that it's on DVD I am on cloud nine!!  I laughed, cried and just enjoyed this movie from begining to end!!  I'ts a must have, especially if you enjoy the blues, music in general or a great tale of folk lore!
B00005K9LK|5.0|That's really all that can be said. This was JP's break through album back when albums were still around. It was fresh, fast and clean. The band hit their stride with this release and did not look back for almost a decade after. Great tunes and Halford's at his best!!
B000000OR9|5.0|This album was lost in the shuffle of late-80's metal guitarist solo projects, but it shouldn't have been.  Sykes proves himself to be a wonderful vocalist (although not a great lyricist), and the Tony Franklin/Carmine Appice rhythm section makes this the most adventurous trio of its era.  Almost prog-metal, its a real shame that this band didn't have a chance to continue.  I still enjoy listening to this music after fifteen years, so they must have done something right.   <br />
B0002XVQNU|3.0|This movie is good, standable compared to some films, not Marvels best, but not its worst. This movie is of course about the blind superhero/lawyer, Daredevil, played by Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck is not the best actor, but this is one of few Ben Affleck movies that the male gender might like. Colin Farrell of course plays Bullseye, and is probably the most popular character in the movie, funny, and has a lot of great moves in the movie, Farrell is impressive. Jennifer Garner is also good, as she plays Elektra (a character with a movie of her own), Jennifer does really well, a lot better then what i was expecting, the training scene after her fathers death was truly well done. Michael Clarke Duncan plays non-other then the Kingpin, and does a pretty impressive job in his own right. The movies only downside is its pace, it does move a little fast and slow in areas, some direction is lacked in scenes, some of the acting is bad, and some CG shots look dull. Overall, average Marvel movie, definitely not the best, but if you are a Marvel fan, this is for you.
0790729369|5.0|once again meryll proved  how convincing her acting is!!!! my favorite scene  is when \\"robert\\" was telling her some of his funny expereinces as a photographer... his story about his encounter with a female \\"gorilla\\" was so funny meryll can not help \\"raising her legs\\" her laughter was very spontaneous and convincing!!! and of course the scene in the laterv part of the movie when she was  grasping  the truck handle whether she will go ahead and join robert, or be unselfish and  avoid  the ireversable effect of the whole family!!!!!just watch the movie then you will know what i'm talking about!!!!!
B00005R62K|5.0|Beyond the Realms of Death!!, yup this cd was a very good one and like every other Priest offering, it was a little different than the ones before and the ones to follow.  Better by You, Better Than Me is a great tune with a hot guitar lick to get it going. The cd kicks ass from beginning to end and it sounds pretty darn good if you ask me considering the year it was originally recorded. One has to remember that this was before Priest really got the heavy sounding guitars going at full blast. This cd has more of a classic rock sound mix than full blown metal and yet theirs no doubting what it is and what is, is great metal.
0380002930|4.0|I was required to read this book for high school English.  I assumed that I would hate it, though I loved to read.  A really long book about rabbits?  I thought, \\"You've got to be kidding.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I just loved the book and it was one time that I actually kept up with (and even got ahead of) my homework.<br /><br />This book is a classic fantasy.  It tells the story of a band of rabbits (from their perspective) that need to find a new home because theirs is being destroyed by humans for land development.<br /><br />You grow to love the characters and truly care about their plight.
1881273156|5.0|I read this book for a class that I'm taking called Human Relations.  I found \\"The Five Love Languages\\" to be one of the most interesting and easy books to read.  The author's premise is simple:  there are 5 love languages that people communicate and express their version of Love.  These languages are words of affirmation, quality time, physical love, acts of service, and recieving gifts.  So Chapman theorizes that each of us has ONE and only one way that we express love and that for me meant physcial touch.  After reading the book, I finally understood why some of my relationships did not work out and how and why obsessive emotion (falling in love) doesn't last.  I learned that love is a choice based on emotion and reason.  I wished that I had this book 10 years ago to save a relationship that didn't work out.  Yet, now, I'm the wiser for it and utilize his theory in my other relationships:  family and friends.  This book has the power to turn the most difficult, trying relationship into bliss while understanding how to speak your mate's love language.
B0000D14JV|5.0|The movie Freaky Friday is a great  movie. <br />The movie is for teenagers and for the whole family. The movie Freaky Friday is about a relationship between a mother and a teenager daughter that always arguee. One day a spell was put on them, and they changed their identities. The daughter had to deal with the mother`s paitents (the mother was a psychologist), and the mother had to be a teenager again! <br />All the issues that were dealt in the movie come with a great sence of humor, and because of it those who see it will like it. <br />The movie is a great one, the actors are very good, and it is for all the family. <br />Another reason that we like this movie is the fact that movie tells about something in the real life (although the plot isn`t real). In the real life people need to be someone else`s shoes in order to understand him! <br />We recommend you all to see this wonderfull movie...! <br />
B00024I2Z4|4.0|Although \\"Mulan\\" isn't my favorite of the big Mouse's productions, it is definitely in my top ten.  In this tale, a young girl goes against tradition and takes her father's place in a great war with the Mongols by disguising herself as a young man.  The tale has been told before in various forms, but it works very well in this picture.<br /><br />The story gives girls a strong message of doing what you believe in or what is best, even though it may go against tradition or the majority's point of view.  In the end, Mulan not only gains the respect of her fellow soldiers, but of the entire empire of China.<br /><br />The action sequences are fairly intense, although there are really only two major battles.  The first is the brilliantly animated fight in the snowy mountains where the Chinese, outnumbered, take on a huge Mongol force lead by the sinister main villain whose name escapes my memory right now.  The second major conflict takes place in the emperor's palace and spills into the streets of the city.<br /><br />The characters in this film are all given proper introductions, though the main bad guy doesn't have many chances to develop.  All we really know is that he wants to take over the Chinese empire.  Ming-Na Wen provides the speaking voice for Mulan.  The rest of the character voices include B.D. Wong, Pat Morita and a hilarious Harvey Fierstein.  Of course, everyone focuses on the comic relief of Mushu(Eddie Murphy).  Murphy does a splendid job with the character, though I think he could have been given a little more room to expand on the character.  In all honesty, Mushu is almost as funny as Murphy's \\"Donkey\\" from the \\"Shrek\\" films.<br /><br />The songs in this film are pretty good.  \\"Reflection\\" is a rather good song that is performed by Mulan(singing voice provided by Lea Salonga).  The song is very inspiring.  My favorite song has to be \\"Be A Man,\\" however.  It just sounds great and reminds me of Elvis' \\"GI Blues.\\"  You'd think the military would be an odd setting for musical numbers, but it works in both of these films.  Another excellent song is \\"True To Your Heart,\\" performed by Stevie Wonder and boy band 98 Degrees.  It's a very peppy, feel-good song that finishes off the film in great fashion.<br /><br />The DVD includes a number of special features.  From games to the obligatory \\"Making Of\\" featurette, it's all here.  There is a music video of the aforementioned Stevie Wonder/98 Degrees song and a very, VERY virginal looking Christina Aguilera performing \\"Reflection.\\"<br /><br />Overall, a fine addition to the family DVD collection.  I highly recommend this to folks with young daughters due to its good message.  Don't worry if you only have sons, the message works for them as well, and there's plenty of action to quench their craving for fight scenes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ld be an odd setting for musical numbers, but it works in both of these films.

B000003TA4|3.0|I'm not going to say \\"Nirvana is the worst band ever\\", because they obviously aren't near as bad as Good Charlotte or Simple Plan. However, they should NEVER be compared to acts such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, etc.  <br /> <br />Some refer to Nirvana as the \\"greatest band of the 90's\\", but I think Opeth, Children of Bodom, In Flames, and especially Dream Theater have them beat on that one.  <br /> <br />I give this ablum 3 stars, mainly for influential reasons. If you're a fan of simple rock like the Ramones and Green Day, then go ahead and pick this up. Just don't label them as the greatest rock band of all time, because they couldn't even touch Yes or Rush.
1400043662|2.0|Disclaimer: I love Murakami and have read every novel he's written outside of \\"Pinball.\\" <br /> <br />That said, I found \\"Kafka\\" his least impressive work by a wide margin. Some of this, I am convinced, is due to the translation, which is not only uninspired but in many places downright sloppy. There's far too much \\"says-ing\\", \\"was-ing\\" and general verbal passivitiy in the book. (At this point I think it's only fair to give some credit for the sheer magic and lyric power of 'Wind-Up Bird' to Jay Rubin, who somehow seems to translate a different Murakami than either Gabriel or Birnbaum.) <br /> <br />As for the work itself...I don't know. I see that a lot of people really enjoyed it. I found the philosophy boring, the plot plodding, and the characters very poorly sketched. In the way that a true Gus Van Zandt fanatic can derive pleasure from watching \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,\\" I enjoyed reading this book, but it did not have anywhere near the same kind of effect on me as his others have. I felt like I was struggling to hear the voice of the writer I know and love beneath a screeching jumble of white noise.
1401301010|5.0|After reading this book i almost feel as if i could speak authoritativly on the evils of intravenous drug use - without ever having touched a needle.  <br /> <br />This book is graphic, at times sickening....but after you finish the last page, you feel a closness to the author that is unbelievable...keides makes you feel his pain, his joy, his lust for life, for rock and roll, and for a large part of it, heroin, and alot of it.  <br /> <br />If you can stomach it, i highly recomend this book.
B00009V7T2|4.0|I have plenty of background listening to \\"prog rock\\", or ...whatever.  This album has alot of spectacular musicianship, and is sonically incredible.  However, (and this is where the missing star comes into play) they seem to be missing the connective tissue that binds a record like this.  In an album like Floyd's Wish You Were Here, or Tool's Lateralus, you really feel the connection between tracks.  Not to disrespect the brilliance of good stream of consciousness writing, but this seems like it's missing something to pull it all together.  With the collective talent in this band, though, that might happen pretty soon.  This is their Meddle.  Still worth listening to.
B000003TA4|4.0|This is Nirvana's best album. I give it a rate. I listened to all the tracks. But I only like 5 out of 12. Featuring Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium, Breed, and In Bloom. <br />Those were the best ones on this album. There were some bad tracks on this album. Territorial Pssings was very bad!! The album is really good from 1, to 6, then it dose not get good anymore, get's boring. Especially the last track was feelin to slow. Something in Your Way. Smells Like Teen Spirit rocks so <br />hard that I could listen to that over n over again, because Kurt <br />Cobain sings YEAH!!!!! That's very funny. I've also liked Polly, <br />but if you put drums in it, it would be Nirvana, rocks like teen <br />spirit. <br /> <br />Smells Like Teen Spirit: This song rocks so hard that I could <br />play this song over n over again. Kurt Cobain sings great vocals <br />and even the YEAH!!!!! chant. One of my favorite songs. It's also <br />a classic. Great work. 50/50 <br /> <br />In Bloom: Heavy Metal is that has 4 minutes of great riff and <br />good Cobain vocals. 44/50 <br /> <br />Come As You Are: Another radio classic along with Smells Like <br />Teen Spirit and Lithium. Vocals are true by Kurt. And the music <br />is still really good. 45/50 <br /> <br />Breed: This song goes faster and faster after I heard it a few <br />times. 39/50 <br /> <br />Lithium: This is another great song from Nirvana. Drums are perfect and especially the Yeah chant is cool!! One of their best. 50/50 <br /> <br />Polly: Like I said before, if the drums were in this track, then <br />I would think Nirvana is the hard rock case. Kurt sings vocals well in this song. 33/50 <br /> <br />Terretorial Pssings: Ouch!! Bad song! Not too much Nirvana here. <br />It's more of a Back in Black type song than a Nevermind song. <br />Watch out, this song is very ugly. 0/50 <br /> <br />Drain You: This track was marginally better. 24/50 <br /> <br />Lounge Act: Okay, it's faster, got some more likein the beggining. 30/50 <br /> <br />Stay Away: Now on my review, this song, Kurt was mad, and screaming, this track you better watch out!! 8/50 <br /> <br />On a Plain: Not anything to say on this song. 14/50 <br /> <br />Some Thing In The Way: This song was a little too slow for me. <br />18/50 <br /> <br />The first part of Nevermind is better. It rocks so hard. But <br />this album is so much better than Back in Black (AC/DC). <br />If you must, a rock fan must own this cd for sure and I hope <br />you buy it because it's heck of a great album. <br />

B00005AQE8|5.0|tupac is the best because he can make songs like cant c me which are fast paced music that makes you want to fight. he can make songs like picture me rollin where it takes the normally wretched and annoying country twang and put it into an amazing beat. but the most extrodinary thing about this album and pacs abilities is no more pain. normal rappers like jayz and eminem can never make a song like no more pain. this song captures a very creepy feeling and puts it into a hip hop format. whats so amazing about that is hip hop is primarily fight/dance/sex/club music. thi takes that creepy feeling from songs like marilyn manson's \\"godeatgod\\" and makes it hip hop... it may not sound like much but i love to hear different hip hop especially with all the garbage mainstream on the radio today.. <br /> <br />and being different is not the only reason no more pain is great.. its great because its...well...great... <br /> <br />this is my first pac album and i do indeed plan to buy more..
0783241569|5.0|An outstanding romantic comedy, Notting Hill, brings to the screen the love story between an Englishman owner of a bookstore and an American movie star with all the ups and downs that that entails! <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least, especially Rhys Ifans' character who as Spike, steals the show!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Notting Hill is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
B00005JN4O|5.0|I was very touched by this film. It is much deeper than I imagined while viewing it. The images still remain with me. I think this is a great film because it touches the human heart and soul.
B0006399FS|3.0|Most of these tracks are well written and performed, but contain very little substance, which is a shame because U2 is usually so good at putting incredible substance into their music.  My musical/emotional response to most of their albums (and b-sides) is huge.  My response to most of this one is to want to listen to a different one.  There's very little impact (except for on 1 excellent song).  There's some familiar U2 sounds here and there, but I don't take much away from this one.  Plus I outright dislike 3 of the tracks (something I can't say of ANY of their other albums). <br /> <br />I think the problem started with the ATYCLB, which was an ok album (with a few really good tracks), but started heading them in the wrong direction, musically, with songs like \\"Stuck In A Moment ...\\".  I have this horrible feeling from these albums that they are heading for a style of music which I can't stand, kind of empty flat boring stuff sort of like how I consider Bruce Springstein or whatever.  Thankfully, they aren't there yet or this would get 1 star.  Hopefully I'm wrong and they won't go there. <br /> <br />That said, there is some good stuff here and there.  In particular, I find Original Of The Species to be a superb song that DOES have an impact, and is without a doubt the best song on the album.  Too bad the rest didn't sound like this one.  They should make this one a single. <br /> <br />Vertigo and Miracle Drug are ok.  Love And Peace or Else is ok, although I don't think they reached it's potential at all or it could have been truely great.  Most of the rest are ok but feel like they just could have been so much better, leaving me feeling dissatisfied with them.  The 3 I can't stand (musically speaking) are \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"A Man And A Woman\\", and \\"Yahweh\\". <br /> <br />Musically, they need to cut down a little of the excessive guitar noise (sounds like some of it is mixed kind of wrong), avoid the depressed/boring chord progressionsin songs like \\"Sometimes You Can't...\\", and add far more keyboards (there's some places in some tracks where I can hear where keyboards are needed and they would have used them on their older albums for sure).  They should not subscribe to the recent trend of replacing keyboards with guitars that are turned up too loud, but unfortunately there is some of that on this album. <br /> <br />Overall, I'm giving it 3 stars because, while it's not a good U2 album at all, it's ok in a general sense.  But I would not have bought it if I wasn't a huge U2 fan, unless it was just for Original Of The Species.  I'd recommend instead purchasing old albums, or singles with b-sides (an incredible very recent b-side is Summer Rain - why couldn't this album have sounded like that?). <br />
B000002UEB|5.0|Operation mindcrime has to be the best album ever, it is powerful and catchy throughout. The song eyes of a stranger is my favorite song of all time, Geoff tate in my veiw is the best vocalist in the world today, he proves this in operation LIVEcrime a live cd with the track list of operation mindcrime. He sings every last song perfectly from start to finish, and doesnt let down in eyes of a stranger either. This is truly one of the best power/heavy metal albums ever!
0790736233|4.0|Contact, brings to the screen the likely scenario of the S.E.T.I. program and/or others like it, successfully establishing contact with an extra-terrestrial civilization. <br />Jodie Foster and the rest of the cast carry out their performances pretty well. <br />The only setbacks are in relation to the \\"love story,\\" which seems forced and is rather weak, as well as what seems to be a lack of chemistry between Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey.   <br />Aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both EXCELLENT!  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  Contact is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment. <br />
1591396190|5.0|Read this book and free yourself from focussing on your competition. <br /> <br />Blue Oceans has to be the most important business read of 2005. <br /> <br />This book goes way beyond identifying historical strategies that have created entirely markets to give you a practical framework for doing the same in your own industry. Finally some-one has defined creativity & innovation in the business context - applied correctly, this framework could be a great tool for evaluating new strategies before they launch.  <br /> <br />All investors should demand to see the \\"strategy canvas\\" for any new venture they invest in and its importance should be elevated above \\"competitor analysis\\" in any standard business plan.
B00007KWI9|3.0|You can't have a much more unassuming debut album for a band as legendary as Yes.  One song is brilliant, three are good, and the other half of the album is dull and forgettable.<br /><br />\\"Beyond and Before\\" kicks things off with a bang.  We get to hear Chris Squire's \\"lead bass\\" sound for the first time, and the vocal harmonies mesh perfectly.  This is one of the hardest rocking songs Yes has done outside the Trevor Rabin years, and quite possibly their best short-form song.<br /><br />The Beatles cover \\"Every Little Thing\\" rocks hard as well, and makes for a great jam piece onstage.  The jazzy \\"I See You\\" is impressive, and \\"Survival\\" succeeds thanks to beautiful singing from Jon Anderson.<br /><br />The rest of the album, unfortunately, isn't as memorable.  Nothing bad, just nothing I'd want to listen to more than a couple of times.<br /><br />This album is worth buying for \\"Beyond and Before\\" alone, which for some stupid reason didn't make it on to The Ultimate Yes compilation album.  However, this album, more than anything else, provides a fascinating look into the bare bones roots of Yes, one of the greatest bands in rock history.
B000002LCB|5.0|This music is beautiful. I rate it 5 stars because each song has a different kind of beauty in it, but each is similarly enchanting. When you play this music and close your eyes you can basically watch the movie in your head. If you loved the movie, you will love this music. I can't get enough of it.
B00005U8EM|4.0|Groundhog Day......comedy or philosophy flick?   I guess its subjective to the audience. People will enjoy it for different reasons.   It is nonetheless a classic.   <br />  <br />Brief overview:  Bill Murray plays a weather man who for unknown reasons lives the same day over and over again in Punxutawney Pennsylvania.  The day is February 2nd, groundhog's day.  Each night he lays down to sleep, or dies, and is reborn anew, again on February 2nd.   <br /> <br />First off I'd like to point out that this film sits on a foundation of lies and has affected many people's lives in a terrible way:  It wasn't filmed in Punxutawney at all.  The director and producers felt that Woodstock Illinois was more \\"idealic\\" and choose to do principal photography there.....this eventually led to envy and resentment on the part of the real life citizens of Punxutawney.  Over half the population of Punxutawney actually invaded the town and homes of Woodstock to enjoy what, after viewing the film, clearly was a more idealic town.  As murderous doppelgangers, they adopted the lives of the Woodstock folk and still live there today.  It was a sad turn of events unpredicted by the film's creators.  If only they had thought of the consequences hundreds of lives would have been saved. <br /> <br />With that out of the way.....I think the natural course of the film's premise is going to take you through a very pure human emtional progression.  The original screenplay was lightly based on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' Five Stages of Grief which are: 1-shock/denial;   2-anger, rage, resentment;   3-bargaining;   4-depression;   leading to 5-ultimate acceptance.   I find it most interesting to see that this progression leads Murray's character to the realization of the benefits of acting with morals.  This provides a great example that people do not need external threats of eternal damnation or rewards of heaven to act with good natured morals and to treat others with altruistic compassion.  At stage 4, Phil (Bill Murray) acts violently out of his depression of being trapped.  He kills himself in many ways.  He robs banks.  He goes joy-riding on railroad tracks.   Then when he finally accepts his fate, he knows when and where to be to help everybody in town that has a mishapt.  He catches a boy who falls from a tree, replaces a flat tire for some old ladies....and so on.   <br /> <br />Perhaps it is to be seen as a kind of divine working of the universe that it is only after this stage of acceptance when the repeating day ends and Phil finally gets to see February 3rd.  Also it is never revealed why Phil went through the whole thing or why it suddenly ends. <br /> <br />Whatelse?   <br />- Um, Murray's humor is borderline assinine, which I think is gggggreat!  <br />- Director Harold Ramis actually admits on his commentary that he helped write the theme song \\"Weatherman\\".  Once you hear this song you will wonder why anybody would ever admit to writing that horrid tune. <br />- I'd like to know why there is no hot water in Phil's hotel.  That is never explained, not even on the director's commentary.  Its kinda like they just decided to do something odd without purpose. <br />- Every religious fanatic thinks this movie is based on their particular faith.  Go figure!  Turns out the movie IS secular, even though writer Danny Rubin is referred to (never confirmed) as Zen Buddhist. <br /> <br />In summary, it does snow in space.
0307165485|4.0|I  really like the book BUT I just want to mention that if you are looking for a book of STORIES, you should know this book has alot of pages that just label things....which is fine.  Like \\"work machines\\" labels all types of machine.....they also have pages on the body parts , food etc.....But if you are looking for a book of stories, this book is not  that....I find myself skipping lots of pages to get to actual stories with my 4 yr old.....I try to get involved on the labeling pages but she wants a story.<br /><br />Bascially I thought I was getting a book choc full of Richard scarry stories and it was not exactly that.<br /><br />But I still think it deserves 4 stars cuz it is a great book....
B0006399FS|3.0|I have loved U2 since I first heard them in 1981 with the &quot;Boy&quot; album. Edge's soaring guitar and the lyrics always reached out and touched me. I followed them through all the changes and albums and mostly they have never failed to please, even &quot;Pop&quot;. This one leaves me with mixed feelings.<br />I first heard &quot;Vertigo&quot; on the Apple Music webpage and played it over and over again. I went out and bought the single soon after I first heard it. I was anticipating something spectacular. Unfortunately, the album did not live up to the promise of &quot;Vertigo&quot;.<br />After my first listen I said &quot;What happened????&quot;. It just did not meet expectations. As I often do I listened to it again and became pleasantly surprised by what I heard.<br />Most of the album is good and the songs are well done but do not fit well with &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Yahweh has to be the weakest of the bunch. So, on the whole, this is a good album but not a great album as, say, &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; or &quot;Unforgetable Fire&quot;.

B00062ZE3U|5.0|Make no mistake - this album has a different sound from Mother Earth.  It attempts to evolve from Mother Earth by mixing it with industrial elements, and largely it succeeds.  But again, make no mistake - this album focuses more on sorrow, as is trademark of the goth genre.  The whole album weaves a tale of sorts, and the concept of a love found and lost is woven together powerfully with the music arrangement, serving together as a powerful image album as well as good individual tracks.  However, this album is not really a metal album, as guitars take a second seat to the orchestra. <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, See Who I Am is a great start to the album, boasting of a spectacular onslaught of an orchestra and a kick off to the story of two lovers.  The vocals and lyrics provide an interesting mix to the song as well.  Jillian (I'd Give My Heart) continues that, bringing together another superb use of choirs to bolster the tribute of love as well as to put a foreboding mood on the state of the lovers.  Now, as for the third song, Stand My Ground - I am of mixed opinions on this song, as it has a great sound to it, but the lyrics are horribly put together.  The lyrics are as cookie cutter as most popular songs get, and they really put me off at times.  Thankfully, the succeeding song, Pale, is quite the opposite.  It shifts the mood  by putting together vocals that ooze of sadness and failing strength, and a great use of orchestra to draw out the vocals even more.  The arrangement also works wonders, with each element in perfect place, making it effective overall.  Angel continues that trend, bringing together a great mix of orchestra with vocals.  Memories is quite possibly the pinnacle of this particular style, with the gradual crescendo of music and an excellent balance of instrumentation.  Somewhere is another song that is of similar vein as Pale, although much more minimalistic, but very effective.  The bonus tracks are also nice, especially The SwanSong, which sports a great application of arrangement of the orchestra to accompany the vocals. <br /> <br />I didn't speak much of the imagery, or exactly how the orchestra draws out the vocals so well, because it takes an understanding of the nuances of each instrument, and depicting all of that is long and unnecessarily drawn out.  In short, this is a great album, but it is for those who appreciate a wide spectrum of music and applying elements from various genres that they wouldn't necessarily think of while still maintaining integrity of sound.
B000002AH7|2.0|Don't get me wrong!. This is not bad music at all. In fact, one of the things I like of Miles Davis is his ability on always looking ahead and trying something different. And he tried many things. And mostly he succeed. But although many people like this record I just don't happen to understand it. But I can't deny the effect of this record on me: It bores me. Like most of classical music. I just don't get it!.
0385510454|3.0|This is not representative of John Grisham's best work. While the book was a typical Grisham page turner, I found parts of it to be laborious and not interesting to read. The first part of the book was interesting while the last several chapters were convoluted, difficult to navigate and seemingly rushed. The descriptions of Italy and the restaurants were entertaining. There were too many named characters (Joel's children, ex-wives, employees, partners, enemies)who truly added nothing to the storyline and served no purpose.  Some characters in the story are undeveloped.  Their purpose, I suppose, is to establish intrigue and a sense of terrorism. It was difficult to feel sympathy for a main character who is an adulter, liar, cheater, and selfish felon. His level of intelligence and desire to learn a foreign language at age 52 was however admirable. The end of the book was a disappointment. Perhaps this character will appear in future Grisham novels and I will grow to like him.
B000683VI4|4.0|Love and nurture produce happiness and sanctuary to those who receive, yet it is the giver who is most rewarded.  The awareness of being the provider of tender affection is soul pleasing along with viewing the loved one being nurtured with loving care.  In times of difficulty this affection means the world, as it helps point out that they are not alone.  Often the person watching a loved one suffer will feel a mutual pain, as a deep sense of understanding exists between the lovers.  When time is taking its toll on two lovers they are there to help confirm each other's existence--a worthwhile existence, as they have devoted their life to their partner as a means of expression of the most fundamental concept of human existence - love.<br /><br />The director Nick Cassavetes who made John Q (2002) released his version of Nicholas Sparks best selling novel The Notebook.  The story takes place at a nursing home where Duke (James Garner) is a patient and a day while he is at the hospital he reads a book for one of the patents, Allie (Gena Rowlands).  The story that Duke reads for Allie brings the audience a flashback that is interrupted by medicine intakes and visiting children, now adults.  Despite the interruptions Duke continues to read for Allie with strong affection, as Allie persists that she wants to know what happens next.<br /><br />When the audience first gets to meet Allie her behavior vividly depicts someone who is suffering from Alzheimer's.  It hard not to feel sorry for her, and it makes it understandable why Duke would spend time with her.  In addition, Duke is also a patient there and is not about to leave.  As the story unfolds Allie keeps repeating that she recognizes the story, and she might have heard of it before.  These cues together with the girl in the story who has the same name as her and the title of the film should help the audience deduce that it is the same person.<br /><br />Through the flashback the audience gets to follow Allie's (Rachel McAdams), passionate summer romance with Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) to which Allie's parents object.  When the summer ends Allie leaves the South to begin her college studies in New York leaving Noah behind.  Noah writes a letter a day for a year, but when he does not get any response he moves on with his life.  World War II breaks out and Noah enlists, as he gets to fight the war in Africa and in Europe under General Patton.  Allie volunteer as a nurse and through every person she helps she sees Noah's face.<br /><br />Through the volunteering she meets a severely injured man, Lon Hammond (James Marsden), who asks Allie out on a date. Allie does not think that is appropriate, but Lon returns to ask her out again after he has healed up.  The two fall in love, and eventually Lon asks her the big question.  As they plan their wedding, Allie notices a picture in a newspaper that has a photo of Noah.  Old memories come rushing back to Allie.  Overwhelmed by the old feelings being drawn back into the light she decides to return to the town where she once met Noah.<br /><br />Notebook deals with Alzheimer's and how it affects those near and dear, but it does so with kindness as the true dark nature of the degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system is never truly illustrated.  In the superior Iris (2001) by Richard Eyre one can follow the novelist Iris Murdoch (Judi Dench) and her struggle with Alzheimer's as it affects her work and beloved.  This version is darker in the sense of how the disease truly affects people from the beginning to the end.  Notebook merely touches the tip of the iceberg in regards to this horrible disease, and it also does so in other aspects.  Nonetheless, in the shadow of Alzheimer's the audience gets a feeling for how it might feel when the loving partner suddenly begins to forget to confirm the meaningfulness of each other's existence through love.<br /><br />Notebook has an intriguing way of telling a love story, and it intends to keep the audience guessing until the end.  However, it fails in this regard as the story has too much emphasis on one of characters, which generates an unbalance between the characters.  This unbalance removes any intention of suspense, as the climatic end draws nearer, which leaves the audience with a flat \\"well, I told you so\\" feeling.  The technical aspects of filmmaking are very good, as they help elevate the cinematic experience.  In the end, Notebook leaves the audience with a good romantic tale, which had strong potential to be much better., and it intends to keep the audience guessing until the end.

B0002IU988|4.0|This is a great debut album.  Theres is tons of talent in this band. If I could, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />1) Find The Real(9/10)- Great opener, my third favorite song on the CD.  I love Tremonti's guitar solo's in the chorus. <br />2) One Day Remains(6/10)- Decent song, definitally not one of the standouts. <br />3) Open Their Eyes(10/10)- Amazing song. Best song by far, I can't stop listening to it.  It has a very catchy chorus, great guitar solo, and great background vocals toward the end. <br />4) Burn It Down(8/10)- One of the slower songs.  Very good, great vocals by Myles Kennedy.  At first I didnt really like this song, but it grew on me. <br />5) Metalingus(8/10)- A good change of pace from \\"Burn It Down\\" by  being one of the heavier songs on the CD.  Great song.  <br />6) Broken Wings(9/10)- Excellent song, on the slower side, but very good.  I like the spanish-style guitar solo at the end. <br />7) In Loving Memory(10/10)- Amazing song, again on the slower side.  Like \\"Open Their Eyes\\" I can't stop listening to it.  Myles Kennedy's vocals are amazing. <br />8) Down To My Last(7/10)- Good song, but not as good as most of the others. <br />9) Watch Your Words(8/10)- One of the heavy ones on the CD.  This is a great song, there are some amazing guitar parts. <br />10) Shed My Skin(5/10)- This is my least favorite  song on the CD. It isn't nearly as catchy as the others. When I'm listening to the CD, I usually skip this song. <br />11) The End Is Here(8/10)- This is a very good closing song.  It's a little weird, but I enjoy it. The guitar solo is awesome. <br /> <br />This was an excellent CD, they are more of a harder band than Creed, which is probably why I enjoy them more.  If you liked this CD, I recommend \\"We Are Not Alone\\" by Breaking Benjamin.
B00000JBCP|5.0|I don't speak a lick of Spanish, but when my Spanish-fluent girlfriend wanted to introduce me to Spanish-language music, this CD was the first place she turned.  All of the songs are quite listenable, the performance is fantastic, and the live setting adds quite a lot of energy to the mix.  The music is fairly standard pop/rock, with lots of guitars, and a few horns.  Except for the lyrics it sounds like anything you might hear on any radio station in the Midwest US.  But the vocals and the energy really raise it above most Top 40.  I still don't speak any Spanish, but I can sing every song on this album.
0822203073|5.0|If ever there was a text that should not only be read but read and re-read, then this insightful and intensely private collection is it. One cannot stress enough how important the work is, not only in terms of it's strong statement agaisnt racism and facism, but also in terms of it's fragile beauty.<br /><br /> The tragedy of the novel is in it's exposed privacy, the emerging spirit of a developing and intelligent young woman and the sense it gives us of a thousand similair stories never told and lost forever.
B000267JQK|3.0|I brought this CD/DVD pretty much for the extras and the making of 'Broken' with Amy Lee. The songs of the CD are sometimes too vulgar. I have no problem with explicit lyrics but there is a point reached when too much is enough.<br /><br />3 stars go to the extra's and the song 'Broken'. Everything else is a waste of time listening too.
B0002XDODU|5.0|wow....these guys never fail to amaze me...awesome...i never knew that Rammstein had a such a soft side although if u want..u can try for this Import cd called Ohne Dich(Maxi CD)which contains 5 different versions of the same song and each song was totally different really good. <br />Coming back to this album...these guys are good...My Fav Though was  the title song Reise Reise...go and buy this album..u wont regret unlike Mutter which so depressing...HAIL Speed metal gods from germany!!!
B000002URV|5.0|This is the first release from Michel Cretu's Enigma and it does not disappoint. It is a blend of chant, ambient rythms, techno burns and sexual innuendo. I loved it. Nothing at all wrong with spicing up a CD with a woman moaning (well to me it sounds like moaning) in Track 2: Principles of Lust. So boohoo to the critics. Let is Enigma fans revel in the uniqueness and plethora of beauty that these songs offer.<br /><br />Mea Culpa is deeply emotive song full of Cretu's imperiously enchanting voice over. But the best song of the entire CD is the last track: Back to the Rivers of Belief. You have it all in that song, chanting, beats to the dancefloor and soft almost lyrical chiming music.<br /><br />Beautiful CD. I love listening to it even if it is over a thousand times listening to this CD.
B00005JMUL|5.0|Polar Express is one of my favorite films of 2004.  When I first saw it, I did not know what to expect, and I found myself completely engulfed into the film.  I maybe 20 years old, but I found myself actually saying that this is better than Shrek 2.   <br />The reason is that the story itself took me back to my own childhood when I believed in Santa.  The film shows that even though you grow older, you can still believe in what you believed when you were a kid.  This film is an instant holiday classic because it does capture the true spirit of the holidays: giving and caring for one another.
B000002U6E|5.0|This is my second favourite release by Enigma behind Enigma 3. Michel Cretu decided to add Celtic, Native American chanting to this album and continued with the same simple and decisive lyrics and what did we get? A great sampling of artwork of the highest order.<br /><br />Age of Loneliness, The Eyes of Truth and Return to Innocence are complete masterpieces. The whole CD evokes a feeling of contemplation and I feel that Cretu in this CD was trying to get into the listener's mindset and make us all ponder what we are doing to each other, our world and our ownselves.<br /><br />The last track of the CD: Cross of Changes asks us to reflect and think about what our future as a race and as individuals mean. This CD is haunting and at the same time is delicious.
B0000C1733|4.0|I enjoy RHCP's music for quite some time and enjoy thier songs here and there, but never feel like I have to got thier albums. So, I just bought this greatest hits. It's good. Some songs I enjoy listening, some I don't. If you're a casual fan, get this one.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Michel Cretu the creator of Enigma, set about making sure the music of enigma was in the essence of LSD: Love, Sensuality & Devotion. The music of Enigma is diverse and yet in this diversity there is harmony, there is eloquence. Indeed this album release is the best of the best that Enigma has to offer.<br /><br />The CD takes several songs from each of the Enigma Album and blends them together well. By this I mean, the songs aren't randomly placed in the album but have been carefully prepared and placed in order and in a sequence that makes this album such a easy listening, entertaining and engrossing listen.<br /><br />You have chants, you have just musical scores, you have Cretu's magnificant voice - for any listener he or she will get what they want from this album. For any true to the heart Enigma fan - you must have this glorious album
B00006V9A0|3.0|It's okay, but it could be better. I you are a Nirvana fan, stick with thier real albums, not greatest hits. If you are a casual fan, get this.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the CD that headlined Amy Lee and made the band famous. This is also the CD that started the downward trend in Ben Moody and Amy Lee's working and personal relationships. Recently Ben Moody decided to go solo and good luck to him. Fame unfortunately also can ruin long time friendships and even wreck trust. But back to the CD....<br /><br />Going Under, Bring Me to Life, My Immortal and Imaginary have all become hits in their own right. All songs are sung by Lee. She has a voice of an angel and is beautiful in looks and in performance. The song Whisper is sung with a energy that belies the fact of how much emotion these songs mean to her. Of course the lyrics were penned by her.<br /><br />Will Evanescence survive? Will Amy Lee survive without Ben. Only time will tell.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Being a fairly new fan to NightWish (who is also not a teen or a preteen but an adult) I have to say this album blew me away.  The vocals are extremely mesmerizing and catching... the instruments take you away and the collection of it all makes this album unique and worth every penny.  I cant stop listening to it as I love it from Track One to the end.
B000007O9L|4.0|The energy level may be a little low due to the acoustic nature of most of this live album, but the musicianship is way high. You could think of this album as semi unplugged.  The boys are on their game that's for sure.  Marvelous slide and lead playing from Ron Woods, while Keith puts in some of his best and most soulfull vocals I've ever heard him do and of course his guitar playing is impeccable.  Charlie Watts is a freaking rock, he's the man.  And then there's Mick who puts in some of the best singing I've heard him do in years.  His harmonica adds a really nice touch on many of the songs.  The keyboard playing by Chuck Leavell both piano and organ are just great.  The band sound like they're having fun and are really feeling the music.  Like I said the energy isn't at the high level of Get Yer Ya Ya's Out but the playing is tighter, funkier and soulfull.  These guys just keep getting better with age.  If this album were longer I'd have given it 5 stars.
B00065LY1I|3.0|Sadly, due to the public's lukewarm reception to her ninth studio record \\"Body Language\\", Kylie decided to close the Parlophone chapter of her career & release a 'career-spanning' hits collection.  One that would include not just her Parlophone hits, but deConstruction & PWL hits as well.<br /><br />Too bad that this concept only seemed to be ideal.<br /><br />To be fair I think that only Kylie fans who are hardcore (such as myself) will find this a necessary, yet disappointing buy. I say 'necessary' due to the fact that this is the only collection to officially gather together MOST of Kylie's hits from 1987 up to 2004.<br /><br />I have a few problems with this collection: 1)The songs are not in sequential order.  For an artist like Kylie who started off as a simple pop star, it is always integral when compilations are released to use sequential order to show growth in terms of music & vocals.  Both discs have the songs just scattered about in no form or another. But this is only on the US version, the original imported version from a few months back DOES have the tracks in sequential order.<br /><br />2)There are SIX singles missing from this set. Six.  Most of those singles are from her fourth (and last PWL studio record) 1991's \\"Let's Get To It\\".  The other two are from both her deConstruction records ( 1994's \\"Kylie Minogue\\" & 1997's \\"Impossible Princess\\") respectively, as well as a single from her first \\"Greatest Hits\\" in 1992.  While most of these singles were only Top 20 hits, I find it a bit of a slap in the face to title a collection 'ultimate' & it have missing six singles; three of which are integral not only to a Kylie fan, but to her evolvement as an artist.<br /><br />The first time that Brothers In Rhythm (Kylie's writing partners during deConstruction) worked with Kylie was on the single \\"Finer Feelings\\".  This was the song that first saw Kylie writing more lyrically & making an even sharper move to better her musical style. But it isn't here. The singles from Kylie's last two PWL albums (i.e.-\\"Better the Devil You Know\\", \\"Shocked\\", \\"Give Me Just a Little More Time, etc.\\") were pop fluff, but had a much more sharper & sleeker dance feel than the those from her first two PWL albums, & to the uniniated Kylie fan hold up.<br /><br />She had two new songs from her first original \\"Greatest Hits\\" in 1992, \\"What Kind of Fool (Heard All That Before)\\" an ironic tribute to her time at PWL & her lukewarm, yet cute cover of Kool & The Gang's \\"Celebration\\".<br />Only \\"Celebration\\" made the cut.<br /><br />Two of the singles from the deConstruction albums \\"Where Is the Feeling?\\" & \\"Some Kind of Bliss\\" which are not available on any official Kylie compilation are left off.(They appear on Kylie Minogue \\"Hits +\\")<br /><br />3)No special tracks  or b-sides.  Yes we do get two new tracks, both of which are good; but what of the randy cover of Olivia Newtown-John's \\"Physical\\", which was left off of the \\"Moulin Rouge Motion Picture Soundtrack\\", & not available anywhere? Yes they included her odd, yet entrancing ballad with Nick Cave \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\" but she did another colloboration that was just as good during the deConstruction days.  Some of you know what I'm referring to; featured on former Dee-lite dj Towa Tei's 1997 album \\"Sound Muesuem\\" \\"GBI\\"(German Bold Italic). Also, certain singles that were only released in certain countries: \\"It's No Secret\\", \\"Cowboy Style\\", & \\"Your Disco Needs You\\" come to mind.<br /><br />I guess that my main beef with this is, is that just because her Top 40 fans snubbed \\"Body Language\\", her hardcore fans get a 'casual' collection of hits.  I could've dealt with this if hadn't been titled \\"Ultimate Kylie\\", because it is not.  We all know she'll do a bigger compilation that will be 'ultimate' & we'll have to shell out more money for it because she didn't do it well enough this time around.<br /><br />That said, this is a must for ANY Kylie fan because it does collect her Parlophone era hits for the first time, casually pairing them with her previous hits.  But if the newbie's do discover more Miss Minogue's work, they will discover this isn't enough & will also have to buy these 'hits' sets to have a full collection of Kylie's singles: \\"Greatest Hits 87-97\\" & \\"Hits +\\".<br /><br />As a Kylie fan I will always love her & support her, which is why I bought this.  This set does have really cool picture medley shots of Kylie from all three eras.  Very well done.<br /><br />Hope the next 'greatest hits' is more 'ultimate'.e newbie's do discover more Miss Minogue's work, they will discover this isn't enough & will also have to buy these 'hits' sets to have a full collection of Kylie's singles: \\"Greatest Hits 87-97\\" & \\"Hits +\\".

B00013F35I|2.0|I've only watched this DVD twice in over a year.  The second time I had to force myself.  I have a nice surround sound system, not the best but nice, and the vocals were especially too heavy compared to the music.  It's a very bad mix overall. Not full and rich sound at all.  I was very excited to get the DVD after viewing the Live in New York City DVD.  Now that's a wonderfully produced and mixed DVD.  The sound is awesome on the NYC DVD.  Stay away from this one unless sound quality is not that important or you just want it to fill up your collection.
0156027321|5.0|If I hadn't read the prologue and the very end, I might have come away wondering what all the fuss was about. But I did, and WOW!  <br /> <br />There were parts when I was wondering which direction it was going to go, like the whole carniverous island thing, and he was a bit heavy on the religious thing at the beginning, but on the whole it was brilliant.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nightwish has produced several exceptional albums, but this time they managed to top themselves.  Once has that \\"it\\" appeal...it is bombastic, and yet still accessible.  The album offers a great variety of tones, moods, and sounds that will satisfy any taste, and will thrill metal fans who search for originality.<br /><br />From the opening number \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\", you hear the great orchestral arrangement that compliments the music so well.  It is basically like hearing a heavy metal movie soundtrack.  There is a lot going on, but somehow, it works.  And it works to damn near perfection.  This track alone is worth the purchase, but it continues with the 2 songs that could help the band breakout here in the states, \\"Wish I Had An Angel\\" and \\"Nemo\\".  The brilliant thing about these tracks is while each of them maintains intense musicianship, they both have big hooks that will be embraced by a more mainstream audience.  And at the same time, they will satisfy even the most jaded metal fan.  The assault continues with \\"Planet Hell\\", easily the albums most fierce song, and goes through a rollercoaster of changes as the album continues.<br /><br />Opera and metal meet in perfect harmony.  Who would have thought?
B00008EUS3|4.0|They're better known for the sprawling double-disc \\"Mellon Collie And the Infinite Sadness,\\" but the Smashing Pumpkins first leaped onto the scene with \\"Gish.\\" It's not as epic as some of their later material, but still a vibrant, musically-polished album, and one that has the flavor of experience on the first time around.<br /><br />Kicking off with the undulating riffs of the excellent \\"I Am One,\\" the Pumpkins slip effortlessly between multilayered hard rock (the mind-blowing \\"Siva,\\" the magnificent bass-sputtering \\"Tristessa,\\" the panoramic \\"Snail\\") and haunting ballads (\\"Rhinoceros,\\" the vaguely psychedelic \\"Crush,\\" the sweeping \\"Suffer\\") before wrapping up with the eerie \\"Daydream.\\"<br /><br />It's a rare band whose music can still be so relevant so long after it first came out -- let alone still being a voice for the disillusioned. Originally released in 1991, \\"Gish\\" definitely established the Smashing Pumpkins as a musical force of genuine artistry, talented songwriting and musical integrity. It's hard enough to find one of those, let alone three.<br /><br />The grinding, kinetic guitars and bass in the harder songs form a wall of solid sound, except in \\"Siva\\" -- there, the sound keeps dying away to complete silence, before reviving with a swirling roar when you least expect it. At the same time, Corgan tones down the guitars to a gentle acoustic strum in the more balladic songs. Jimmy Chamberlin's lightning-fast drumming is an excellent accompaniment, as is D'Arcy's bass.<br /><br />As a songwriter, few rockers can parallel Billy Corgan; his songwriting has the quality of poetry set to rock, which aren't things you generally see together. Corgan's high, reedy voice is interwoven well into the music, giving his poetic lyrics a certain heartfelt quality. And bassist D'Arcy gets to shine with her low, sweet voice in \\"Daydream.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gish\\" is recognizably the Pumpkins, at the roughest stage of their musical development -- but with edge, the musical force and the beauty that just needed refinement.musical force and the beauty that just needed refinement.
0743454529|5.0|I had never read anything by Jodi Picoult before and absolutely fell in love with her writing.  She made you feel for each individual character and their separate and personal feelings.  Sometimes we all need a good cry, and this is a book for that.  You will laugh, you will cry, and you will question certain aspects of life and what is considered \\"living\\" after you read this book.  It was a great selection for our book club too as it brings up a lot of great discussions on parenting and faith.  I would recommend this book to any one who is looking for an emotional and thought provoking book.
B000000W3G|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins created a sprawling, rich rock masterpiece with \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\" They also created a lot of songs that didn't make it to the final cut, but ended up being attached to the singles as a series of EPs. \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\" collects those five EPs together, and creates a B-side/single collection that is well worth having.<br /><br />The first song on each disc is a song from the \\"Mellon Collie\\" double album, but the five or six songs that come after each single are unique to the EPs, originally from various recording sessions. These songs are often as good as -- sometimes even better -- than what did make it onto the albums.<br /><br />Each EP has its own mood, and its own self-contained flow, keeping the B-sides from feeling tacked on. One is hard and angry, one is bitter, one is soft and sweet, one is feel good, and so on. As a result, the full range of what the Pumpkins were able to do -- rock, pop, metal, ballads and experimental -- got put on full display, in all their glory.<br /><br />For example, in the \\"1979\\" disc, the Pumpkins get to explore their alt-pop side, while the \\"Zero\\" disc explores bitterness and loneliness, sticking to their hard-rock sound. Not to mention the orchestral/acoustic flavor of the \\"Tonight Tonight\\" EP, with its subtle strings and laments, and a lo-fi reprise of the title song.<br /><br />But there is no lag in quality, just because the B-sides didn't make it to the final cut of \\"Mellon Collie.\\" Songs like \\"The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)\\" prove that Pumpkins B-sides are still exceptional, including covers of bands like Blondie and the Cars (yes, that IS Blondie's \\"Dreaming\\" you hear Corgan singing, strange as it is).<br /><br />The heart of the Smashing Pumpkins was Billy Corgan, and Corgan's talents shine in most of the songs here. He delves into orchestras, distortion, lo-fi acoustics and jazz, all in the name of experimentation. Corgan's complex songwriting resembles poetry set to music, and his high, slightly offbeat vocals seem well-suited to the songs he sings. James Iha also wrote and sang a bit on these collections, including a pretty duet with Nina Gordon of Veruca Salt.<br /><br />If fans have the EPs already, then they will already have the content of \\"The Aeroplane Flies High.\\" But if they don't, this exceptional collection is definitely worth getting and keeping.

B0006284JQ|5.0|Britney Spears hits paydirt with her fifth album Greatest Hits: My Prerogative.  Since 1998, Miss Spears has ruled the roost of pop music, and this is evident on this CD which features all her biggest hits, excluding \\"Born to Make You Happy,\\" \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" and (sadly) \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,\\" but features her krunk-like remake of Bobby Brown's \\"My Prerogative\\" and two original tunes that're probably chart-toppers in their own regards: \\"Begun Having My Fun\\" and \\"Do Somethin'.\\"  Britney Spears is the definitive female entertainer, whether you like her personally or not. <br /> <br />1.

B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's second Grammy-nominated album is as good teen pop as its predecessor, but better.  Every song (with the exception of the latter ballads) are perfect teen pop tunes, but its singles make this CD a must-buy!  Perfect pop.
0385510454|3.0|Okay, considering the fact that I finished it in a night and usually only reserve this honor for something truly engrossing (the fact was that there was nothing on on a Sunday night), it wasn't bad. But while I was perfectly enchanted with the Clancy-esque idea of dangling a parolee out as bait to find out what country wanted him dead the most (and by doing so, find out what country got shafted by him at the height of his power), Grisham didn't do a very good job of unraveling the web of this plot. The immersion in Italian culture aspect of the story was wonderfully written, which may be a product of his recent non-suspense efforts, but his sense of climax and closure is barely a tenth of what it used to be. The ending is a pretty big let-down, and is hardly above the threshhold of the old \\"suspension of disbelief\\" yardstick. I don't want to give anything away (not that there is a whole heckuva lot to give away in this anticlimactic disappointment), so I'll leave my review with this: enjoy the buildup, enjoy the body, but be prepared to have a bad taste left in your mouth once you read the final 30 pages. <br /> <br />It's worth a read, but for god's sake, don't pay full price for this hardcover.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears' Grammy-nominated album Britney is just as its name states: It's all about Britney.  She's a \\"Slave 4 U,\\" \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.\\"  That's good ~ but the only thing that makes this CD not as decent as her others is the fact she doesn't look like she means it after you see her video.  Sure, \\"Slave\\" is a friggen hot piece of eye candy and the song, though really different from her previous top 40 pop singles, is pretty great for a dancehall tune, Britney Spears appears like she has much to say about nothing.  This more funk-infused disc is pretty good and a full-listen, and it's amazing to see how she's grown.
B00008YLV2|5.0|Watching \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a harrowing and at times very over-whelming experience. This film's greatness is making the viewer understand the hell our soldiers experienced(and still go through). The film is unrelenting reality. Combat enters your living room, and your house is a war zone. Few movies have actually caused me the feeling of real terror; this one did. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" de-glamorizes war and hopes you understand the bravery and sacrifice of our fighting men. The story is a true one and, it is powerfully told. It does justice to those who lived it. Ridley Scott has directed with his usual brilliance, and made a film that has a place at the top of it's genre. This is now an essential classic.(For those of you who really liked this one-I suggest buying the 3-disc \\"Special Edition, it is one of the best in my collection. It is loaded with hours of documentaries, deleted scenes, commantaries-you name it! It was well-worth the whole weekend it took getting through it!) <br />
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears' 2003 disc In the Zone epitomizes pop/dance/funk/R&B at its best, from the opening number \\"Me Against the Music\\" to her Grammy-winning performance on \\"Toxic.\\"  She's never been more groovier than on Zone, and her songwriting is accompanied almost with every song, most especially on her self-composed ballad \\"Everytime.\\"  Spears' vocals may sound a little overproduced by the mixers at times, but its unique beauty is evident on \\"Shadow,\\" a song she co-wrote and performs amazingly.  In the Zone is where you want to be! <br /> <br />1. Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna) - 5/5 <br />2. (I Got That) Boom, Boom - 4/5 <br />3. Showdown - 4/5 <br />4.

B00005JMUA|5.0|\\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\" is a movie that will surprise you. As a big fan of 2003's \\"Vol. 1,\\" I was eager to see the final chapters of the total film. After the film began, I was pretty much in complete shock during the entire viewing. As fast, kenetic, and high energy as \\"Vol. 1\\" is, \\"Vol. 2\\" slows down the pace enourmously. Tarantino's decision to decelerate the second half of his \\"Kill Bill\\" opus was both necessary, and masterful. At the end of \\"Vol. 1,\\" the audience learns that The Bride's (Uma Thurman) daughter is still alive, while The Bride has believed her to never have been born. This is a clever device which serves two purposes: It gives the audience a terrific cliff-hanger at the end of \\"Vol. 1,\\" but also sets an appropriate pace for \\"Vol. 2.\\" Not only do we now that The Bride is on a collision course to finding out the truth about her daughter, but that there's no way she can prepare for said revelation. However, Tarantino brilliantly gets both the audience and The Bride ready for this confrontation through a more dramatic and heart-felt \\"Vol. 2\\" of his epic. By slowing the pace and theming of his second film, most of which takes place in the barren desert of the South-West United States as opposed to frenetic Tokyo, Japan of \\"Vol. 1,\\" Tarantino forces The Bride, relax and take time to realize the path of revenge that she has chosen. In the end, it's an astonishing piece.
B00005T7I1|4.0|I don't believe the reason this movie was good was because it had box office success.  I don't believe this movie was good because it was complicated.<br /><br />Dick Tracy is like the gangster-noir films of the '30s, '40s and '50s with a heavy importance placed on the visuals.  The visuals fit the events, and one gets a feeling of film noir that is totally new and relevant.  Using visuals to tell the story can be more important than the plot, since the art of film deals with a visual medium.<br /><br />I also don't understand how people would reject Danny Elfman's score, which is fun and seems to fit the comicbook theme and subject.  Elfman's music actually goes somewhere, whereas I will never understand the greatness of, let's say, John Williams, whose music I generally reject as hollow and uneducated.<br /><br />The cast is amazing, and Madonna in particular is actually good in her role as \\"Breathless Mahoney\\" contrary to the actress' awful reputation.<br /><br />Movies should be judged on their CINEMATIC QUALITIES.  If the film were not a film, but a book instead, people's hard criticisms might be justified.
0783240236|5.0|Strangely enough, or maybe not strangely at all, the film has aged. The building of the suspense, the progression from one strange behaviour of one bird to a mass attack from flocks, schools and shoals of birds is still perfect. We are also observing the building up of the hysterical attitudes of human beings in front of this situation, in all the shades and hues we can imagine. The bird-lover who does not want to believe it and turns against the stranger as the one who caused the disturbance. The drunkie who finds in the Bible the perfect explanation of the end of the world brought by birds. The rational policeman who refuses to believe it and tries to find some more criminal explanation. And then ordinary people who lose all sanity and become agressive, paranoiac and even psychotic under the shock when they realize that they cannor do anything against thousands of birds who are the perfect uncatchable army. Then Hitchcock goes a little bit further by showing how one or two people can remain sensible and resist the attack and run away without causing a new attack. But there is no hope, except to run away and hide. Against such a mass of assailants there is no real protection or defense. They can break windows, peck through roofs and doors. They are all-powerful. Hitchcock of course mixes a dose of humour in this drama, particularly in the first half with the meeting of his « Jane » and « his « Tarzan » in a bird shop where Tarzan, sorry Mitch, is looking for two lovebirds. Love indeed will come out of it, but on how many corpses and victims. Humour turns sour and bitter. But the ending is kind of flat : running away on tiptoe in a car after the battle lacks luster and shine, the flight of powerless people who cannot stand tall in front of danger. This is a new way of looking at the world. No fight is proper when you deal with a nearly invisible, innumerable and massive attacker. This is maybe a lesson about our modern world : we are very helpless in front of terrorism when it moves masses of warriors who do not fight according to standard war rules, methods and laws. How can you catch such enemies who are always on the move and are a multitude of unpredictable kamikazes ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUism when it moves masses of warriors who do not fight according to standard war rules, methods and laws.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|Madeline Peyroux is a gem.  Backed up (mainly) by bass, piano, electric organ, and her own guitar, she applies her throaty voice to a wide range of standards. Her style -- vocals, backup, and arrangements -- has matured since her first CD, Dreamland, and her emotional investment in every performance pays rich dividends.  Peyroux covers rock, country, jazz, and French folk music with equal facility and imbues each song with her own personality and flavor.  This CD deserves all the attention it has received, and more.
B0002OERI0|2.0|\\"Bvl. of Broken Dreams\\" is a great song with a horrible title. I really think that's it for this CD though. It's not so much as it's bad as it's just... boring.        This band reminds me a lot of JD Salinger and his books other than Catcher In The Rye (in regards to Green Day's Dookie.) I don't really think I have to explain myself there.
B0000BWVCL|4.0|X2 is a good continuation to the first movie X Men. X2 starts exactly where the first one ends. In this movie the war between the mutants and the humans goes one step further. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his team, the X Men, are going to prevent the war. Mutant-hating scientist (Brian Cox) wants to fight and kill the mutants. The scientist wants to take over Xavier's machine that can find all the mutants and the humans in the world and kill them. The effects in the movie are a bit better than the first one, but the acting in this movie and the plot are still flat. The movie sticks with the comics, which is a good thing. But sometimes I feel that the movie is going too fast for the viewers and its hard to understand the plot. X2 is a good movie for all ages. If you are a fan of comics and/or action movies this movie is for you!  <br /> <br />
B0006GAOBI|5.0|It's too bad that Donnie Darko never received that theatrical run it deserved, because I can say without a doubt that it IS one of the ten best film of the last decade. Genre entertainment doesn't get better than this! <br /> <br />Donnie Darko is a very disturbed boy. He seems depressed, quite lost in his own life. Things happen around him, things he cannot explain, things he has no control over. His life just doesn't seem to make any sense. So when a very tragic incident occurs in his neighbourhood, his life will be changed forever. <br /> <br />The plot is so twisted, the story line so messed up that it's impossible to explain what the film is about in just a few words. What I can say is that Donnie Darko offers one of the best story's I've seen on the screen in a very long time. Great performances, a great supporting cast and a great storyline makes this one a winner in my book. <br /> <br />Now, with the new director's cut, we're offered more of this cult classic. Scenes are added and a new soundtrack, the one the director first wanted before money became an issue in postproduction, only inhence the great experience that Donnie Darko offers its viewers.  <br /> <br />This is one movie any film lover should see. Donnie Darko will amaze you, will leave you breathless, and will make you want to see this one again. I've seen it six or seven times already, and I just can't wait to see it again. Donnie Darko truly is a modern classic.
068987474X|1.0|Are you kidding? Males start off complicated with the mixed messages they give females on the playground. You remember your mother's saying:  \\"If he teases you Dear, that means he likes you.\\"  Meanwhile, you just want to give the offending little cad-in-training a sock in the eye!   <br /> <br />The title of this book in itself is insulting.  The book itself is insulting to both sexes.  It seems to view male female relationships in black and white, yin and yang, right and wrong, good and bad, like or dislike.  Second of all, it is oversimplistic even in terms of men.  The over all tone of this book goes back to that atavistic \\"Me Tarzan, You Jane\\" image of men and women and seems to paint men as 'rulers of the world' unhesitant and unquestioning.  The position of the authors is that men say and do exactly what they mean.  But if that were the case, then this book never would have had to be written in the first place.  Obviously, if guys were that simple and their every action mirrored their inner motives then this book should have been entitled:  \\"Men are aggravating, ever changing, manipulative cads who just want to see you squirm\\".  Men question themselves all the time.  They doubt themselves and they fear rejection.   <br /> <br />They too, like women, don't always know what they want.  I've talked plenty of my shy guy friends into asking a woman they really liked out for a date.  I have a guy friend who's quite the ladies' man, though not a cad, who got a call from a gorgeous girl he really liked.  Yet he never returned her call because she made him nervous and he didn't know what to say to her.  <br /> <br />If a man gives a woman mixed messages, I think it's oversimplistic to say that he's not at all interested in her. In addition, I think it's unfair to say that his uninterested behavior negates his interested behavior.  Don't get me wrong, I I'm not advocating hanging on to a man who's not giving a woman what she wants.  That's for sure.   I too have had mengive me tons of mixed messages, calling me out of the blue and asking me out when I haven't even really thought of them in months and then acting completely nervous and disinterested on the date.  And yes, I've stopped hoping after them. But when strange behavior like that is going on,  I've got to think there's something more going on beneath the surface.  It's nothing I could or should try to change or fix, nor should I hope to ever go out with that man again.  But after the initial disappointment of having to let a man go, I find it beneficial, even even self-nurturing to appreciate the good and bad of the experience rather than make myself feel like a loser as I say goodbye to a man because \\"He's just not that into (me).\\"  (even if he's the one who initiated the date in the first place.)  <br /> <br />Obviously there's something a man is interested in about you if he shows you interest just as there are things about you that disinterest him if he shows you disinterest.  After all, if men are as simple as the authors of this book would like us to believe, then why would they feign interest and waste their time with us if they're not interested in us at all or are just going to turn around and change their minds about us later on?  That makes just as little sense as women rejecting men for every little infraction on their part because \\"he's just not that into us.\\"  It's the 21st Century anyway and we all have issues and strange reasons for doing and not doing the things we do.  Nobody is perfect and nobody will always give you what you want anyway.  I feel this book is just another nod in the direction of glib, crazy-making, two minute pop-psycology that slaps sisters around with that dispassionate, 'get over it' Dr. Phil tough love that I find so annoying, oversimplified and abrasive.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Saw will never become a genre classic like Seven or The Silence of The Lambs. Although it shares many similarities with these movies, it still has too many plot holes and quite a few thing going against it to stand proud with those films. So why am I giving the film 4 stars? Because Saw offers one heck of a great time, that's why. <br /> <br />The Jigsaw Man abducts his victims and gives them a challenge they need to meet in order to survive. When a doctor and a young photographer wake up chained in an old decrepit building, the only thing standing between them is cassette player and a saw. They find tapes in their pockets that they will need to play in order to understand the rules of the game; if the doctor isn't able to free himself and kill his partner in less than twenty-four hours, then his family will also be murdered (since they're handcuffed, there's only one real mean of escape... I'll let you figure it out for yourself). <br /> <br />The film is shlocky and the performances (especially Elwes) are often laughable. But what the film delivers, it delivers it great. There are many very intense moments in this one, so many scenes that make you jump out of your seet of make you cringe that it's more than worth the price of the DVD. One flashback sequence in particular is incredibly disturbing and so horrifying you'll be holding your breath until it's over.  Forget about major plot holes (the surprise ending makes no sense at all). In fact, stop thinking and just enjoy the ride for what it is. <br /> <br />Grimmy, atmospheric, dark and disturbing, Saw is a horror movie you'll want to watch with your hands covering your eyes. A great source of entertainment, if nothing more.
1401301010|4.0|ok i'll admit it, i haven't even finished the book yet and i'm already writing a review.  in fact i'm only only page 170, but don't let that deter you from reading this, i do have some points to make!  firstly, after reading just two or three chapters i was kind of in awe of how interesting anthony kiedis's life has been.  seriously, if i was to write an autobiography right now, i'd barely have enough to fill a slim paperback (i'm 15), but by the age of 15 anthony had already had so many experiences, including many many experiences with drugs... this book is guarenteed to make you feel so angelic in comparison with anthony!  secondly i think although it was well-written, there was plenty of room for more about his feelings on certain events.  at times it seemed that we were given lots of step-by-step facts about what went on and not enough about how he felt (although thats just my opinion.)  what i found most interesting was his explanation of songs and where he got inspiration for some of the lyrics.  so yeah, i still have about 2/3 of the book to go, and i'm sure that there will be lots more to comment on when i'm finished with it (i'm sure anyone reading this will heave a great sigh at this point... don't worry, i won't write any more!!)
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is hands down my favorite movie soundtrack! Seriously, I cannot gush enough about this CD. There is not one song on this CD that I don't love. It's even hard for me to pick favorites. \\"God Only Knows,\\" \\"All You Need is Love,\\" \\"Too Lost in You,\\" \\"I'll See it Through,\\" \\"Take Me as I Am,\\" \\"Both Sides Now,\\" \\"Turn Me On,\\" \\"Jump (For My Love),\\" and \\"Songbird\\" rank up there with my very favorites. (I'm sorry-- I know I listed practically every song!) \\"Christmas is All Around\\" was the main reason I bought the CD and it was worth it just for that song! All the Christmas songs are wonderful. I bought the CD around Christmastime, but I've found myself listening to it all the time. You won't be disappointed if you buy this CD!
B000000OUJ|4.0|Gza is the most calm and probably least animated member of the Wu-Tang Clan. So don't go into this album expecting all-out head nodding beats and energy like on Wu-Tang albums. Gza is the most cerebral and lyrical member, as he recites his lyrics almost without emotion like he's reading them off a page. That can be a good or bad thing, but it's what sets him apart from other Wu members. He doesn't yell and get in your face, like say...Ol' Dirty.  This \\"Liquid Swords\\" LP may be underwhelming when you first listen to it. However, it requires many listens to even halfway descipher what he, and other guest Wu members are saying. Rza amazes once again! His superb beats helped immensely to make this album so revered. The beats perfectly fit Gza's laid-back style. It doesn't seem like Gza's on this album all that much though. He features every Wu member(even Killah Priest) at least once, and the songs that he does solo were mostly two verses taking up two minutes or less in time. And the last track is so amazing too! Enlightening and empowering! The song really makes the album complete, and makes you want to bow down before the Genius until...wait, that's not even his song!!! It's Killah Priest on that track! Okay, well I guess Gza wasn't AS untouchable as I thought, but I'll say that he still does drop great material, and a bunch of other dope songs, on this LP. You just can't understand how mad and perplexed I was when I found out that \\"Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\\" wasn't Gza's doing!  This whole album may not have the energy of the \\"36 Chambers\\" album, but it definitely feels like a Wu-Tang album with Rza's beats and the skits and all. Every song is essential here, the only one I wasn't feelin' too much was \\"Killah Hills 10304,\\" but I know that one appeals to other listeners. I would have to say that \\"B.I.B.L.E.\\" is slightly my favorite here, even though it ain't Gza. Otherwise, my personal favorites are \\"Gold,\\"(with a 'golden' beat) \\"Cold World,\\" \\"4th Chamber,\\" \\"Investigative Reports,\\" and \\"Swordsmen.\\" The \\"4th Chamber\\" is an excellent collab with Ghostface, Killah Priest, and Rza(who drops an absolutely amazing verse). \\"Cold World\\" features Inspectah Deck and has appropriate singing. \\"Shadowboxin'\\" was cool too, but I would of liked to hear more from Gza and not so much Method Man. Every song on this album is quality though.  I recommend this album to experienced Hiphop listeners out there, possibly even newcomers. It's a dark experience that just keeps growing on you the more and more you listen to it. I'm still catching new things as I listen, and it's been in my stereo for an extended amount of time. That's rare for me! I'm still trying to get over the fact that the last song was Killah Priest, not Gza, but I still give this one at least 4 stars! I think I'm going to check out a Killah Priest album before I buy another Gza joint however.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I didn't think that Buble' could improve from his debut label disk, but he did!!!!!!! <br /> <br />His voice is stronger and more mature and if anything he really raises his emotional quotient and the album soars because of it. <br /> <br />Why it took so long for him to be discovered is beyond me, but boy, I'm glad he's here and here to stay. <br /> <br />I now own all the Buble' albums (including his first independent ones I purchased on ebay) and you can hear him maturing in voice and phrasing and he does soar on It's Time. It's Time for him to be recognized for a tremendous musical work of art. <br />Join me in wishing him only the best in life and if it's true about his engagement -- congratulations!
B00004Y6NU|4.0|Mark Knopfler threw the stop watch out the window when writing the songs that became \\"Love Over Gold.\\" In the process, he moved from guitar hero to songwriter extraordinaire. Even though many of his previous songs were self contained stories - \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" and \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" spring to mind - they were nothing but precursors to the epic \\"Telegraph Road.\\" Giving a history of a small town, from the founding by the lone adventurer with a sack on his back to the boom and the bust, then he neatly dovetails into the collapse of a love affair (\\"now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care\\"). The song builds into a crescendo of desperate, crying guitar and a longing final verse, echoing the heartbreak of rural towns that suffered through the eighties conservative boom. It's probably my favorite Dire Straits song.<br /><br />If that weren't enough, there's the hard boiled private eye saga of \\"Private Investigations.\\" Dryly sing-speaking his way through the story of a man who sees his world collapsing, it contains the wonderful final verse that precedes the sound of a cocking pistol, leaving the actual conclusion to the imagination of the listener. And on the original album, that was just side one!<br /><br />The three remaining songs are pretty good, and includes one of DS' best known and humorous pieces, \\"Industrial Disease.\\" Featuring Knoplfer doing his best Richard Burton impersonation as the Doctor delivering the litany of medical failures in the worker, it also has one of the best lines in any Dire Straits' song as \\"Two men say they're Jesus. One of them must be wrong.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love Over Gold\\" also has the kind of soaring guitar work that Knopfler is known for, and the closing track, \\"It Never Rains,\\" pays homage to Dylan. They are fair songs on an album that contained three classics. The sound quality is also a standout. Recorded before the CD, era, the pristine recording was a highlight of the early compact disc releases. Next to \\"Brothers In Arms,\\" this is the finest audio set in the Dire Straits catalog.

0893815233|1.0|I came across this book accidentaly on the job, in the bag of a client that I was authorized by the client to check, even while they were not present.  It is required of me to open the book and search it.  I respect the first amendment and believe in it, and defend this author's right to publish her art.  I found it disturbing to see that she doesn't care that anybody....ANYBODY, could see her children and some may not see it as art, at least other than pornographic art.  I am not ashamed of the body, not at all.  But as a parent, I think you have to protect your children.  I believe that she could have put her children in harm's way.  Just because you believe in nudity, which I infact do, doesn't mean that it should be shown to the public.  Yes, it is a book bought, however, when was the last time that a book wasn't misplaced, lost or viewed by somebody who for a multitude of reasons for safety of the child, should not view it?  I saw a book filled of pictures that focused on those parts of the body that general consesus (yes, OK by the majority, which is not always a bad thing) would call \\"private parts.\\"  Focused on.  I just want everyone to know that is interested in this as art and purely as art, if bought, know what it is first, to protect the innocenct.  It is not my place to tell anyone to buy or not buy anything, just be prepared for what you may discover in this book.  If you are a parent that even if you respect nudity, but believe that it should be shared in an intimate way, or in the very least by friends and family only, unless you are ready to believe that nudity is OK to be seen by any walk and desire of life, then steer clear of this book.  If you are going to buy it make sure for the sake of children anywhere, you have a system set up to ensure that you can control it.  Nudity is beautiful yes, but it is not for everybody and if it is one thing I can't stand it is not being careful enough to keep it to yourself.  She felt OK to publish it, that's OK, just think of children and the dangers out there, that's really all I wanted to caution on.  I cried for those children when I saw the photos.  For my own children, I do not wish to force my beliefs on them, rather let them evolve their own, and I would be sad if they viewed it now, for the concerns that it could, COULD, bring to them of confusion.  I am a biologist and respect the fact that viewing private parts can cause an arousal of sexual desire.  But for children, that arousal can go in many directions, some which may not honor the value of life in general, should harm come to anyone involved.  So please, if nothing more, just be careful.
B000683VI4|5.0|I watched The Notebook before I read the book, and I was amazed at how closely they followed the book. There were some places where they changed a thing or two, but for the most part they followed the text. Ryan Gosling is great as a young Noah Calhoun, and Rachel McAdams does an excellect job of portraying Allie Hamiltion. It was worth watching, and it is worth watching over and over again. Nick Cassavetes did an amazing job. Nick Sparks wrote such a moving love story, and I love all of his books. All of you, keep up the good work.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Special Features? A Travesty!A letter to Warner from a film buff and a plea to Directors Martin Scorsese and John Carpenter.<br />Generally, I'm in total agreement with the many fine reviews listed here, and I need to add two important caveats... Firstly, where are the interviews, film stills, lobby posters, not to mention commentary tracks and possibly isolated music track?!?<br />Secondly, with such a fine print, why is the colour balance slightly off, especially noticeable in the red-orange bias of the colour of blood? (Warner got it right with their DVD release of The Curse of Frankenstein and their VHS release of Dracula; why not here?)<br />Lack of Special Features: Horror of Dracula is considered to be one of the finest examples of British filmmaking as opinioned by Phil Hardy (editor of the Aurum Film Encyclopedia) and other film historians. It is reported by Christopher Lee to have single-handedly saved Universal Pictures from bankruptcy in 1958. It has a great worldwide following of filmgoers including directors, John Carpenter and Martin Scorsese. <BR>The DVD of a film of this stature deserves a complete roster of special features! Warner, you own the exclusive rights to this classic (as told to me by a Hammer Films executive)... so where are they?!?<BR>Actor Christopher Lee (Saruman from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;) has many personal stories about this epoch making classic and I believe would jump at a chance to share them with film buffs worldwide in an in-depth DVD interview. (He did so with the DVD release of Hammer's lesser (relatively speaking) &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; on MGM DVD.) Lee's story of attending the New York premier of Dracula with fellow actor and good friend, the late Peter Cushing is fabulous and should be preserved on DVD for all to experience! Let's see and hear more touching anecdotes about the personal and professional relationship between two of the greatest acting duos in film history. (The conclusion of Lee's interview on the Baskervilles&quot; DVD is very moving wherein he shows us how much he misses his friend and colleague, Peter Cushing. I want to see more of the heart of this powerful actor in current DVD interviews! (and movies!!!) This actor is capable of playing more than just great villains! What better movie than the one that put him &quot;on the map&quot;!<BR>Composer James Bernard, who wrote the powerful and evocative music to Dracula would also have much to say about writing this classic score, and about the special demands of writing quickly for Hammer. This music was truly ahead of its time in taking seriously and respecting its subject matter!<BR>Screenwriter, Jimmy Sangster has much to say about his fascinating formative days at Hammer and has done so in his books, but I would like to see him do it in an in-depth interview on DVD! For example, film enthusiasts would love to see him tell his story about what he did with the original Dracula script! (Second guessing fame is ironic!)<BR>1958 is quite a ways off in time; sadly we will never have a current interview with Peter Cushing or director Terence Fisher on DVD... the point here is that time is of the essence with these talented people! Through Warner's apathetic approach to its release of this classic film, film buffs and film enthusiasts may never get to hear and see the insights and reminiscences of the original crew to this unique British masterpiece! This is living film history! Don't wait too long to correct this injustice to the world of film, Warner! You might not be able to...!!! I'm looking forward to the Special Edition of Horror of Dracula!!!!<br />A plea to filmmakers Martin Scorsese and John Carpenter... Please use your position to work with Warner to rectify an impending lost to the world film community!

B0001XAPY2|4.0|This film marks when Miyazaki started to get a little odd with his films. Not that that's a a bad thing, but Porco Rosso was certainly made with an older audience in mind.  <br /> <br />Although often credited with inspiring Disney's Talespin (it was not, Talespin started in 1990, while this wasn't released until 1992) this returns once again to Miyazaki's fascination with flying and period pieces. Perhaps a bit too cerebral for kids who like Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service, it's still a sweet introspective story. The old cliche about beauty only being skin deep was never so appropriate as it is here. <br /> <br />As usual Miyazaki's designs are wonderful to watch as is his choreography of flight scenes.
B000127LW2|5.0|Voyager to this date remains the only Star Trek series I like. For the first time I felt like I wasn't watching a bunch of recycled stories. <br /> <br />Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway was without a doubt the best captain of a Star Trek series. <br /> <br />For those complaining about the packaging? If you hate the packaging so much, why'd you pick it up? You could clearly see what kind of packaging it had before you purchased it. So, you knew what you were getting into before hand. Personally, I think the packaging is very cool. <br /> <br />And for the person who complained about two episodes missing? I only have one question to ask. Why would Paramount include two episodes from the Original Series -- Arena and City On The Edge Of Forever? I don't know about the overseas sets, but those two episodes were not Voyager episodes, so therefore they don't belong on a Voyager set. <br /> <br />All in all, a very fitting DVD set beginning for a very wonderful series.
B0006J28BO|4.0|It seems that Miyazaki has been getting more and more surreal in his old age. He constantly revisits old themes, but gives them a greater dream like quality than before. <br /> <br />The Cat Returns in no exception. Not quite the surreal dreamfest of Spiritd Away, it is quite different from Whisper of the Heart's reality. Yet it holds a lot of fairytale charm. Much like what Alice in Wonderland would have been like when it was first published before becoming such a part of our culture to render itself a cliche. <br /> <br />The Baron design always interested me from Whisper of the Heart and it's good to see more of that with other cat characters.  <br /> <br />For those who love cats, this is an especially enjoyable treat as the cats here display behaviors that every cat owner will recognize in humorous ways. For instance, the Cat King's idea of what good gifts are when showing gratitude. :) <br /> <br />All in all a very good addition to the Ghibli library. There are other Ghibli features that are better, but none of them are worth anything less than 4 stars and if there was a 4 1/2 option, that would be the true score for this film.
B0002F7I9Y|2.0|It'd take me a finger or two to count soul singers who have consistently delighted with their music. Ray Charles would be out there in the forefront. Which makes it difficult to comprehend why he should choose to dilute his legacy with duds toward the tailend of his career.<br /><br />I recently bought \\"Thanks for Bringing Love..\\" and was horrified with the plastic-funk arrangements and a tired Ray whimpering his way through the shag-fest.<br /><br />One miss in an otherwise illustrious career would have been a forgivable coincidence, but now comes this utterly lackluster duet compilation, making it two misses and that's just plain careless.<br /><br />Let's see what we have here barring a Who's Who lineup of stellar names.<br /><br />\\"Here We Go Again\\" sets us off with a soft, soothing rumination and has Norah Jones written all over it. Decent start. James Taylor and his potatoe pie are both equally tasteless though, followed by a stodgy rendition of \\"You dont know me\\" with Diana Krall. \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\" sees an over-the-top, borderline noisy Elton John. It's tough to go wrong with Natalie Cole who makes for a spry break in the dependable \\"Fever\\".<br /><br />\\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\" features Bonnie Raitt as it poses a largely rhetorical question, for it doesn't quite cross the listener's mind at all. \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\" surely wafts us to the nostalgia of Ray's earlier works and makes us truly wonder where that good year went. The yawns induced by this song are reinforced by Michael McDonald up next doing a particularly balmy turn of \\"Hey Girl.\\" I waited, and waited, from here on for the album to pick up an occasional gem, in vain.<br /><br />Vile as it is to knock someone's efforts posthumously, it must still be said: save yourself the disillusionment and go for some of Ray's finer, self-sufficient efforts of yore. Why the Grammies would dote and drool on this album is beyond me.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa has always been my favorite Miyazaki film. I'm not a big fan of post-apocalyptic future stories, but Nausicaa is the one major exception. The scenes of flight have not been matched in any film, animated or live-action.  <br /> <br />Although US parents may feel it is a little too violent for children, they may want to consider it first before rejecting it off hand. The ultimate message here is that violence is futile and pointless. It is only when Nausicaa completely gives up and makes a selfless sacrifice that anything in the movie is solved. Never since Lord of the Rings (the books) has there been such a moralistic story touching upon tolerance, compassion, environmentalism and love for living things told without preaching or beating the audience over their heads. By the end you're completely unaware that any messages have been transmitted at all, yet they are there. <br /> <br />Nausicaa is so much wiser than the adults around her and they respect her for that. Which teaches kids another lesson in responsibility and maturity as well. <br /> <br />The later Miyazaki film Mononoke Hime tried to revisit these same themes (with the same Nausicaa character designs!) with a lesser effect.  <br /> <br />And who doesn't want a Teto of their own? :)
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|If you loved the movie \\"Love Actually,\\" you need to own the soundtrack. This is a really great collection of feel-good music. There are some great classic songs included on this CD (Joni Mitchell's \\"Both Sides Now,\\" The Pointer Sisters' \\"Jump\\") along with some more modern favorites (Dido's \\"Here With Me,\\" Maroon 5's \\"Sunday Morning\\").  I really like the two Christmas songs that originated from the film: Bill Nighy's rendidtion of \\"Christmas Is All Around Us\\" and Olivia Olsen's \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" (for a little girl, she sure can sing!).<br /><br />Unfortunately, Craig Armstrong's \\"PM's Love Theme\\" (also known as the \\"Love Actually\\" theme song\\") is not included on this version of the soundtrack, but you can get it on the imported version that includes a few extra tracks.<br /><br />This is a really fun CD. Even the teeny-bopper song by Sugarbabes didn't ruin the experience for me!
0156027321|3.0|This book is billed as a story of survival so miraculous that it will make you believe in God.  If this book convinced me of anything, it was the exact opposite.  That and the appalling egocentricity of the human being. <br /> <br />One is presumably inspired to faith by this story because a boy survives a shipwreck and untold months lost at sea in a lifeboat with a 200lb tiger.  I suppose it is expected of the reader to be so absorbed in the first person perspective and to identify so exclusively with the main character that they overlook the mountain of human and animal corpses that are collateral to the boy's story, and somehow find his survival inspirational.   <br /> <br />If this story has a hair of truth to it, and the suggestion is that it does, the entire dead family and the intensely horrible eviscerated zebra (which survives for more than 24 hours minus his intestines and screaming which I will never be able to erase from my mind), not only convinces me completely of the NON-existence of God, but of the sickening egocentricity and obliviousness of human beings to all other life to fall for this book's promise.  To declare that there must be a God almighty watching over us on the evidence of one live boy amidst all these corpses, and this poor screaming animal is just ridiculous.  I don't know how you do that math and come up with God.  If you believe in God after that ghoulish mess, or are inspired to faith for the first time by it, please, let's not share book recommendations.  I really resent that this book was billed this way. <br /> <br />The truth is, with the exception of the zebra scene which I really wish I'd never read, it was a good story.  If I'd read every word exactly as it was without that plug, or if it had been billed simply as an incredible story of survival, I'd have an entirely different feeling about it.  But I was so preoccupied with looking for the promised evidence of God which never appeared, and instead finding everything to the contrary, I couldn't enjoy the story for what it was.  In the end, the warped viewpoint of applying that promise to this story just killed it for me. <br />
B00008RWRH|4.0|When I think of Eugene Jochum the first thing that pops into my mind is Bruckner, not Haydn. These recordings have been in and out of the catalog for years, but at this price, they are a steal! Jochum is a wonderful Haydn interpreter. What you get in this set are light-hearted rhythms, delicate execution, graceful and polished playing, and well-paced performances -- the way Haydn SHOULD be played. The London musicians give the listener the transparency expected when Haydn is performed. The only minor flaw, if there is one, is that some of the Menuettos tend to be a little heavy-footed. <br /> <br />In particular, Jochum's take on Haydn's 101st was a revelation to me.  What has been nick-named \\"The Clock\\" gets a real racy treatment that grabbed me by the throat. And Jochum never let go! The opening movement is played with attention-grabbing exuberance. The big plus with this set is the jaunty Haydn 88th. <br /> <br />This is another set that the serious Haydn collector ought to have at his disposal.

B000683VI4|4.0|After reading Nicholas Sparks Notebook. I looked forward to this movie with much anticipation. I was glad to say I wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed the film very much. The story of Noah and Allie are played to perfection by Ryan Gosling and Rachael McAdams. Also the older Noah and Allie played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands. The DVD features are a real bonus with commentary by Nicholas Sparks and Casssavetes also Rachael McAdams and Ryan Gosling Screen test are worth checking out.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is another classic New Zealand film with amazing performances from all the cast.  I dropped lucky with this movie, I got it for a dollar would you believe!  Blockbusters was selling ex-rental copies to raise money for an appeal and I happened to be in the shop on that day, lucky or what?<br /><br />The plot is not complex, the Whangara people have long believed their presence in New Zealand dates a millennium, what is more they can trace their origins to a single ancestor who was lucky enough to escape death when his canoe capsized in the ocean and he rode to shore on the back of a whale.<br /><br />From that time on the Whangara chiefs, have been considered this man's direct descendants as their natural born tribal leader.<br /><br />Jump forward to the 21st century and we meet Pai played by the understated Keisha Castle-Hughes, an 11-year-old girl who comes to believe she is destined to be the new chief.<br /><br />However Pai's grouchy and somewhat bitter grandfather Koro, (Pai's male twin died at birth) played fantastically by Rawiri Paratene is bound by tradition to pick a male leader and he cannot see that Pai is in fact the next true leader of their tribe and it is his stubbornness and anger that just might lead to a terrible tragedy if he does not open his eyes before it is too late...<br /><br />This is one of the best films to come out of the 21st century; the scenery is breath taking, the acting first class and the sound-track spot on.  What more can you ask for?<br /><br />One of the most wonderful scenes for me is when Pai takes to the sea on the back of whale, at that moment she knows she cannot change her Grandfather's mind so she gives herself to nature and rides on the back of a whale, letting it take her down into the depth of an ancient ocean.<br /><br />A truly awesome film that that is worth watching over and over again just for that scene alone.
0670033375|4.0|This book is well-done and well-developed but requires thinking, which many people simply do not want to do anymore.  A bit of a downer here and there, but good for some great discussion.
B00005JNPZ|3.0|Hitch proves to be nothing more than you're typical \\"run-of-the-mill\\" romantic comedy that offers only a few laughs. The biggest downfall for me in Hitch was that most of the movie's funnier moments were completely squandered by the previews (which is nothing to new in movies these days). This includes the food allergy scene, the scene were Al and Hitch kiss, and the scene where Al shows off his less than decent hip-hop dance moves to Hitch. I'm pretty sure I would have found these parts a little more amusing if I hadn't seen them in the previews on television a hundred times. But then again, movie studios aren't too worried about giving away too much in a trailer, they just need to get you into the theater and that's all they are really worried about.<br />Also, it seemed to me in the last half hour or so, the film really lost where it was trying to go. There were a lot of other things going on plot-wise with a few different characters that made the film seem like it was trying to juggle too many things at once and having a hard time keeping pace with all of them.<br />Other than that, the movie was just okay. There were some other scenes that were worth a chuckle or two. Probably would make a good date movie for most couples. I know my girlfriend liked it.
B000002MUQ|4.0|As someone born in the late 80's, it's hard for me to judge 80's rock bands on the basis of their highs and lows, without putting in my \\"modern\\" view of music. \\"Balance\\" is, however, one of the albums  I have that can come close to melding modern rock with classic. Now, as I understand, Van Halen in its heyday was quite the wild one over 20 years ago, but for those who can't forgive the \\"different\\" sound of Balance, keep in mind that the members of the band, like every one else, age. And I have noticed in other long-surviving bands that, as they grew older, their wild side slowly wane. Eddie, Alex, Mike, and Sammy were in their 40s at the time this album was recorded, which is old enough to feel some fatigue after years of partying, jumping around, and guitar ripping. Thus, some compromise must be called for, in order to keep on their toes.  <br />   With this in mind, I shall get to my review of Balance. <br /> <br />1. Seventh Seal - I never noticed that this song sounds a bit like Poundcake from Carnal Knowledge until I read other reviews here. But I don't care. \\"Seal\\" got a nice ring to it, and Eddie proves he can beat other guitarists living in this world, but I have to say his playing isn't at its best. Still, he can still crank out a melody. The weird low-key chant in the beginning and middle of the song is a bit out of place - a bit too modern for my taste (and those who listen to to the German band Oomph! will hear the EXACT same sound effect at the end of \\"Augen Auf!\\" off their newest album). But overall, \\"Seal\\" shoots high, even if it may miss. <br />2. Can't Stop Loving You - A bit poppish, but nice melody. Sammy Hagar once again shows his romantic side. Best to listen if you're looking for a easygoing day. <br />3. Don't Tell Me - the intro guitar riff got me off guard; pretty heavy stuff, but sets the mood for the song. Also takes a hint from grunge, but in no way does the song sit squarely in that realm. I did notice a harshness in Sammy's voice here,but it's only for the first and last few seconds. The chorus melody, however, doesn't quite match the overall tone of the song. Listen when you're just feeling rotten. <br />4. Amsterdam - I thought this was going to be a good one, but the lyrics... what the hell...? Okay song, but not the best. If it has better lyrics, I would rank it as \\"great\\". <br />5. Big Fat Money - I guess VH was trying to relive their wild days, but their wild days were more organized than this. Gritting on the nerves.  <br />6. Strung Out - WEIRD. It's quirky if you can get used to it. Otherwise, it's a waste of time, but I suggest rewinding from the next song into the last few seconds of this one just to keep the lead-in intact.  <br />7. Not Enough - Love Eddie's piano and melody, but a bit depressing. Eddie doles it out great with the guitar; can't expect too much crazy guitar work given the song's tone. If you're heartbroken/lovesick, fill your day with this song. Sammy still has his voice here; very smooth and high. <br />8. Aftershock - Good song, but somehow I'm not too attached to it. The lyrics are a bit too tedious for me, but the guitar work, drumming, and bass work come together well. The song overal is a bit forgetable, unfortunately. <br />9. Doin' Time - Weird instrumental. Alex shows off his stuff here  , proving his worth from the earlier days (one thing I must add: I'm glad he doesn't have synth drums. They're annoying in 5150). Tumbling-around rhythm, crazy beats, but if you don't like drum solos, skip this. <br />10. Baluchitherium - Where did they get this name? It's so hard to spell. But don't let the title's length throw you off. Here is an instrumental that shines a bright light on VH sans Sammy. Michael Anthony's bass is rather heavy here, and he sets good time along with Alex. Eddie, you're the man here. Over-the-top? A bit yes, but it's great for lifting up spirits. This one alone can sound great in a concert. Shoots up high and floats down smoothly in the endingminute. <br />11. Take Me Back - Playful acoustic. Sammy, though, should really slacken back on the roughness in his voice and let it out smoothly; the song would greatly benefit. Surprisingly, the guitar is rather heavy for a light-hearted song like this; doesn't get in the way, though. Nice for a bright sunny day. <br />12. Feelin' - Powerful, heartfelt song, if a bit emotional. Eddie rips it up once again, and Sammy comes on top. Think your life sucks? Use this to supplement.  <br /> <br />Notice I haven't said much about the lyrics. Really, Sammy's lyrics have always been a bit on the emotional or just-plain-lame side, but hey, I wouldn't care too much about the lyrics if the music itself can overpower them. Also, I haven't said much about Alex or Mike, because frankly, I can't hear their respective work very well (the main focus of the band remains the guitarist and the singer, but don't worry, I carry Alex in high regard, too).  <br /> <br />SO... on a final note. Balance is a worthy album to add to your VH collection if you aren't too sensitive about the band changing over time. Those who want \\"pure\\" VH - sorry, this ain't for you. Go ahead and cry, \\"Where have all the good times gone?\\" (nudge nudge wink wink), but the past is the past, and we and Van Halen must live in the present.  <br />   (And just to let you know, I've heard enough of Van Halen to understand it, with Diamond Dave and the Red Rocker. Dave lended the wild energy; Sammy lended the melody.)
6305537321|5.0|\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is flawless blend of a crowd-pleasing star-vehicle for the effortlessly charming Audrey Hepburn and a bittersweet, painfully beautiful look at love, life, and happiness.  Director Blake Edwards, the man behind \\"The Pink Panther\\" series, \\"The Party\\", \\"Operation Petticoat\\", \\"Victor/Victoria\\", etc., has crafted a truly timeless film based on the novella by Truman Capote.  Though numerous elements of Capote's story were altered, the film still has a strong core and message that urges audiences to examine their own lives, loves, and happiness. <br /> <br />Everything about this film is classic.  You have the timeless Hepburn and her defining performance as Holly Golightly, a sophisticated, sassy call-girl with a secret past who is ultimately one of the most vulnerable characters Hepburn ever played.  Then there's George Peppard, a vastly under-appreciated actor who manages to hold his own next to Hepburn while playing a struggling writer living off an older married woman.  Peppard's boyish good looks and surprising depth make him the ideal match for Hepburn's Golightly. <br /> <br />Then of course there's Henry Mancini's wistfully romantic score and the tremendously popular theme-song, \\"Moon River\\", a true gem of a song that capture's the film's essence perfectly.  In addition, you have Hepburn's fabulous, style-setting wardrobe courtesy of her lifelong friend Hubert de Givenchy.  In this one film alone, Hepburn and Givenchy practically invented the \\"little black dress\\", popularized ballet flats, and introduced capris as a stylish alternative to regular pants. <br /> <br />My favorite quote: <br /> <br />Holly Golightly: You know those days when you get the mean reds?  <br />Paul Varjak: The mean reds, you mean like the blues?  <br />Holly Golightly: No. The blues are because you're getting fat and maybe it's been raining too long, you're just sad that's all. The mean reds are horrible. Suddenly you're afraid and you don't know what you're afraidof. Do you ever get that feeling?  <br />Paul Varjak: Sure.  <br />Holly Golightly: Well, when I get it the only thing that does any good is to jump in a cab and go to Tiffany's. Calms me down right away.
B0002O06N0|3.0|This album is for the most part rather catchy.  I think the lo-fi sound is perhaps just too lo-fi.  Perhaps a mid-fi sound would work better for them.  I thought the songs on this album reminded me most of Tons of Sobs by Free.  It was their first record, it was better than Rubber Factory, and had better sound.  Having said this, Free are no more and I still like that early sound so the Black Keys are worth a listen.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is an excellent album.  She has such a strong voice and is very impressive at playing the piano. She is played on radios and is in collaboration with tons of singers one is Usher. But, she is holding her own ground.  She is amazing and this CD is amazing. I recommend this for anyone who liked her old stuff but more so if you like good mature music.
0060920432|5.0|This book is not an easy read.  It contains some of the most profound and relevant ideas for all people - as do Mihaly's other books such as \\"The Evolving Self\\".  If you want to understand happiness - and how you can make choices to stay in a constant state of fulfilment - then you need to read this (and think about its ideas) carefully.  Its wisdom, when truly understood and applied, could transform life on this planet.<br /><br />It reveals much of what the great teachers have taught and our own conscience knows as established (scientific) fact.<br /><br />In my view, and I am not an extremist (though I recognise that I might sound like one), this is up there in terms of global importance along with the Bible, the Koran, etc.
B000002G7G|5.0|A truly gorgeous and nearly perfect collection, this is surely the Velvets' most underappreciated work.  Perhaps the lack of sonic bullying and grimy lyrical content (it's almost a complete musical 180 from their previous releases) hinder this one from standing out from their other albums, but this is arguably as good an outing as the band ever captured on tape.  Consistently pleasant and decidely hushed, this album casts the band as a versatile group of rock n'roll practitioners rather than some pretentious art project.  Truth be told there's not a bad track here, save for the jumbled narrative of \\"The Murder Mystery.\\"  Most of the songs fall in either the sleepy, ballad-like category (\\"Candy Says,\\" \\"Pale Blue Eyes,\\" \\"Jesus\\") or the more straightforward and R&B groove-oriented (\\"What Goes On,\\" \\"Beginning To See The Light\\").  Regardless of the style, the outcome is always sublime and the flow effortless.  This album is undeniably momumental for not only showcasing the group's compositional talents, but in letting the world know that they knew the value of turning down their amps and letting the songs do the talking.
068987474X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it shed light onto many of my \\"guy problems.\\" Now, I'm just waiting for the right guy to come.  This book taught me a lot
B00067TVHU|4.0|I own all the best dead movies, including this one.  I'm happy to report it met all my expectations.  It's clever, funny and has a healthy dose of gore.  It's the same old dead movie and then it's not.  SOTD made my wife laugh out loud and that's a feat I've seen few other movies attain, dead or alive!
B00001OH7N|3.0|For a hardrock album that deals mostly with mental insanity, the instrumentation feels akwardly \\"in control\\"; the guitars sound a bit flat to me, the drums a bit thin, and the vocals could be much more wild. But the main flaw of TMWSTW is the lack of good songs. As on it's precessor Space Oddity, there's one brillant song; the tilte track, but on the rest of the album Bowie just  fails to deliver the same kind of quality in songwriting. Fortunately things would turn around quickly in the years following TMWSTW, wich leaves this album as a intruiging insight into Bowie's development early in his career.
B0002234LS|2.0|This movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen but it wasn't that great either.  I will admit the only reason I rented it was to see Mr. Depp, but I doubt I'm alone in that.  The story is just boring.  Someone told me this was a scary movie but I did not see that at all.  I figured out the whole surprise 'twist' if you want to call it that before it was revealed.  Johnny Depp is an amazing actor but even he couldn't save this one.  I will give credit to some parts of the movie that did keep me interested but these were very few and far between.  Not Johnny Depp's greatest but if you are a hardcore Depp fan its worth the price of admission.
B00001OH7M|3.0|The folk singer/songwriter style of Space Oddity would later be perfected by Bowie on Hunky Dory, an album that did stand the test of time. Space Oddity unfortunately did not. That's mainly due to the lack of strong songs, but added with the dated and often quite silly lyrics it's just an album that's inferior to a good dozen other Bowie albums; the main one being Hunky Dory, cause it's so similar in style. That being said, Space Oddity remains a charming album with a couple of fairly good songs, and of of course the mother of all Bowie classics: the brillant title track.
B000000XBC|5.0|MOST OF THE REVIEWS I READ ON HERE SAY, VOL. 1 HAS ALL THE HITS, AND MOST IF NOT ALL THE WELL KNOWN SONGS, SO MY REVIEW IS NOT ABOUT THE GREAT CCR THEM SELFS, BUT ABOUT THIS COMPANION TO VOL.1, YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER I'M SORRY BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. WHO'S NOT EVER HEARD THIER ROCKIN' VERSION OF THE LITTLE RICHARD CLASSIC \\"GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY\\" THAT SONG JUST SMOKES, OR THIER VERSION OF \\"THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL\\", THEN YOU'VE GOT \\"BORN ON THE BAYOU\\", \\"COTTON FIELDS\\", \\"MOLINA\\" I COULD GO ON AND ON TILL I NAMED EVERY SONG ON THIS CD. THERE'S SONGS NOT ON VOL. 1 OR ON THIS SET THAT COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR. BASICLLY IT'S THIS, UNLESS YOUR JUST A CASUAL FAN, I DO SUGGEST THIS AND VOL. 1, BUT I'VE GOT THE BOX SET AND I TELL YA, IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY. CCR WAS AND STILL IS, THAT DAMN GOOD. THEY BROUGHT ALL THIER CARDS TO THE TABLE WHEN THEY SET OUT TO RECORD AN ALBUM AND OR SONG. IF YOU DON'T OWN ANYTHING BY THESE GUYS, I DO VERY MUCH SO SUGGEST YOU PICK UP SOMETHING, ANYTHING.. BUT BE WARNED, YOU WILL BE BACK FOR MORE.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is the album that made him famous, and still remains one of his very best. It's a concept album about some kind of sexual alien superstar (or something), but above all it's a fast-paced rock 'n roll album, loaded with great songs. The melodies are exceptional; I especially like the more dramatic songs like Five years and Rock 'n' roll suicide wich have operatic qualities to them. Some songs lack a bit of substance, but Bowie and his band keep the pace high enough, and the melodies strong enough to compensate for that. It's a rock 'n roll rollercoaster, and after all these years it still is one hell of a ride.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is by far one of the most amazing albums I've heard in a very long time. Between the silky vocals, heartfelt lyrics and piano, these tracks made me gasp the first time I heard them. There's a beauty in this album that will bring a tear to your eye- like seeing the Sistine chapel or Niagara falls for the first time. I can't tell you a favorite track, because I can't decide- every single one is a masterpiece. These words cannot do justice to album that has touched me very deeply. I'm speechless.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This movie was just great! Although it seems to be in the same catagory as other teen sports movies, this one goes beyond the same old script. I think what captivated me more was the fact that its a true story that took place in Texas and being a Texan it just got my attention! I'm not into sports at all, especially football, but this movie was more than that. The actors do a great job of making you feel like you're a part of their small town and you feel like you can relate. Overall i think this movie is Awesome.
B0000009RT|5.0|Pure Genius...and I dont use that term lightly...I think that The Mother of Inventions were the true \\"anti-Beatles\\", not the Rolling Stones.
B000000M4M|5.0|To start off what a great album you can't get any better grunge than this folks i mean with songs like \\"POND SONG and FREAK SCENE\\" they are so good but also have really amazing harmonies in the back. So good don't miss this one it's such a classic and it's to bad they never really got the spotlight.
B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|Worst album I've ever heard.  This band is awful; the music is just so embarrassing to listen to.  The first track alone makes you cringe and as for the rest, it's just ripped off from scores of metal bands before.  The vocals are dia, the guitar playing is crap, the arrangements are stupid and I bet there isn't one reviewer for this album that has given 5 stars that's over 14 years old.  If you are a pre-teen nerd then you must really enjoy this trash.  For later generations I would avoid Nightwish because they Suck! Suck! Suck!
034537410X|5.0|This is good writing by a leading scientist who has been working on lucid dream research since the late 1970s, teamed with Howard Rheingold, whose books I always find interesting, well-researched, thought-provoking and innovative in their thinking.<br /><br />It's highly practical with some great, clearly explained, step-by-step exercises. Not all of them would be simple to do but they are certainly simple to understand.<br /><br />LaBerge does have a slight tendency to believe his own publicity, and I have seen questions raised about whether he actually originated all the techniques he claims to have originated in the book. He certainly gives plenty of credit to other researchers, though; the citations are very thorough, and perhaps this is what one reviewer meant by the book being \\"dry and scientific\\". I personally prefer this to the usual New Age style where nothing is footnoted and you can't track down the origin of anything (to read more about it, or to separate out the speculation, common myths and hearsay from genuinely valuable information).<br /><br />Very much recommended; if you are buying only one lucid dreaming book, make it this one.
0385504209|5.0|There is no question that everybody should read this book.  It is very entertaining and full of very peculiar facts (assuming that they are true).  The writer skilfully turns religious history (highly sensitive and mostly boring subject to read) into a  page turning thriller.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I have a general advise though, make sure that you read it on a weekend, as you will not be able to put it down.  I read it on a business trip with near disastrous consequences.
B00001OH7V|4.0|Again, as Low was, half of \\"Heroes\\" is insrumental. But unfortunately, whereas the instrumentals on Low keep getting better and better on repeated listenings, those on \\"Heroes\\" lose their strenght very quickly. They're just not as layered and tend to become a bit boring over time. It's a shame 'cause the vocal tracks on \\"Heroes\\" are quite simply the best Bowie has ever recorded. A great deal of that is due to the guitar work of Robert Fripp; the man is absolutely amazing. I mean, even without him shredding his way through the songs, they would still be great, but he really takes things to another level. Add the two sides togheter and you still have a great album.
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I've been looking forward to this show coming out on video ever since I got into Stargate SG-1, and bought all the seasons of that show. Now it will be fun to watch Macguyver again, season by season, as it's released on DVD. You don't get stuff like this on TV nowadays! A story with basically a positive plot in each episode, where the hero really does succeed, where there are real bad guys, and there isn't all the confusing relativism of TV today (is ANYONE good or bad, or are we all just seeking the understanding of others? and other such rubbish).<br /><br />This collection has no extras, just the episodes. But unlike other reviewers, I'm pleased with the quality of the restoration. On my HDTV, anyway, the quality is top-notch. These old TV shows are recorded in fullscreen 4:3 with mono sound, but on a high-quality TV with a surround system, it's a fun experience (you won't get stereo or surround, though). I noticed no discoloration or any problems with video. The ONLY thing I noticed is the voiceovers are a bit off at times (where RDA obviously over-sampled his dialog in post production, while other actors did not). I love this DVD set, and will enjoy watching it again while eagerly awaiting the next season.
B00001OH7T|2.0|I never cared much for this album and I doubt I ever will. Fame and Young americans are standout tracks but the rest of the songs just sound too much alike. When listened to them seperately they're enjoyable enough, but played one after the other they become a bit of a drag. Bowie's voacal delivery on this album is admirable though, it's just a shame most of his songwriting is not.
0765348780|5.0|This was the best fantasy book I have read in some time. Full of complex character, plot twists, uncertainties. I can't wait to launch into the next book and the ones to follow if it continues to improve as the other reviews suggest. This definitely is not a story that you can read slowly and pick up after taking days off from. I encourage you to sit down and try to knock this out in a period of 5 days or less, or about 100 pages a day. The reason I say that is that there is a lot going on and if you set it down you are constantly going to have to refer to the characters guide, etc. It has been awhile since I have read a book that after 350 pages I am still Asking What? Who? Where.... <br />This series has loads of potential.  My only complaint was that at times he takes too long to get back to a character, so that you have forgotten what was last going on. Leaves you more than a little confused. However, it did keep my focus non-stop and thought it was extremely well-done.  Mr. Erikson, I love your work so far and I look forward to continuing this journey. I do hope that you will continue to write in a timely fashion unlike some other guys (Jordan, Martin).  Martin is absolutely killing me waiting on the Feast. PICK UP THIS BOOK AND ENJOY!
B00001OH7U|5.0|What can one say about this album, other than that there are no bad tracks on it? Every song is close to perfect. The only critique I can give is that there are only six tracks, wich are so good they leave you hungry for more. Even with six tracks the album's running time is long enough to make it an excellent buy. And besides, who'd want to miss out on these songs?!
0380729407|5.0|Jim Nightshade and William Halloway are thirteen year old boys.  They are still boys when Mr. Darks carnival, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, comes to town. By the time the carnival leaves many of the townspeople have sold their soul in exchange of their deepest desires.  Many of the village people, including Will's own father will be tempted by the offer to be young again, while Jim will find the offer of growing up fast irresistible.  William can see what's going on and saves his father and then the two of them fight to save Jim and the town.  <br /> <br />This book was thrilling, scary, and, wise in many ways. The author makes the reader understand that evil is such a powerful force not because it is so awful, but because it is so tempting.  The people of the town aren't really bad people, but in their willingness to exchange their very souls for an easy chance to be something that they are not, and head down the path of evil.  What Mr. Dark is offering is a temptation in every sense of the word. Will has to struggle against him in a truly heroic way.   <br />
B00005K3O4|4.0|This movie falls into the cheesy guilty pleasure catagory. <br />You realize the bad acting and low budget effects should <br />turn you off, but somehow Killer Klowns with popcorn guns <br />is simply too much fun to pass up. It starts off with a <br />old hillbilly(He used to play on the western series Gun <br />smoke alot) spotting a spaceship and decides to see what's <br />going on. <br /> <br />He then naturally becomes the movies first victim. The <br />main characters are two teens Mike and Debbie. The thing <br />is that despite being two of the main characters they <br />add nothing to the film at all. The whole show comes from <br />the Klowns and they're creative and cheesy ways to kill <br />off the people put them in the cotton candy cacoons. <br /> <br />This movie is more of a comedy than a horror film as  <br />nothing really is believable. But with the cheesy one <br />liners totally funny klowns make this movie alot of fun <br />to watch on a late night. Even better if you are totally <br />wasted. The only boring parts is all the parts without <br />the klowns. The best part is the scene with the bikers <br />and the small klown. If you can't laugh at that you have <br />no sense of humor at all. The scene with Mooney and the <br />Klown in the jail is pretty good aswell. <br /> <br />One of the best guilty pleasure movies that you will ever <br />see.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|This really is a great movie. The artwork is by far some of the best out there. The special featuers on this set are a goldmine. The story of Snow-White has been a childhood favorite of many. This feature film brings the classic story to life with vibrant colors and beautiful music.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|It's become very clear that hollywood has ran into a monster <br />creative wall. This movie is just trying to take advange of <br />another little \\"horror\\" era that probably started with The <br />Ring a few years ago. This is a rather predictable movie as <br />even my moronic brother in law seen who the \\"killer\\" was just <br />shortly after he appeared in the film. <br /> <br />The main focus on the movie is two guys with one being a  <br />doctor and the other guy gets paid to snoop and take  <br />pictures of other peoples business. The movie for the most <br />part goes for shock value. Not that I mind, but it's just <br />that the movie isn't as deep/dark and scary as it wants to <br />be. There are a few original ideas like \\"the head vice\\" but <br />for the most part the movie just takes bits and pieces from <br />other movies of the genre and puts them together. <br /> <br />I'd have to say the acting is the worst. Cary Elwes is just <br />an aweful actor in this film. How could the director  allow  <br />such pathetic work? Did Cary just come THAT cheap? Even  <br />Danny Glover was bad in this one! It is sad because even <br />though it steals from other movies it could have been alot <br />better. The acting and bits in pieces seem abit to rushed. <br />And we can't forget the car scene. What's up with that? <br />As somebody said, why not just have a few cut scenes? It's <br />much easier and less annoying. <br /> <br />However, even with the bad acting and unoriginal ideas  <br />even a poor mans Se7en is better than alot of movies in  <br />this genre nowdays. You would probably be better off to  <br />wait until this comes in HBO though. It simply isn't  <br />worth the money. It will will help out a spoof movie in  <br />the future though.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I just love the music in this episode. It really showcases how talented every one is, including creator Joss Whedon, who composed the music as well. In 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' basically anthing goes and that's why a<br /><br />musical works.
B000001EAQ|5.0|When U2 were an incredibly talented band. Brilliant and dark. Listen to this instead, with headphones is even better. This really deserves a carefull listening.  <br /> <br />Enough said.
B0002OERI0|5.0|3 practically perfect CD's in a row from a great rock band.  I can't say enough about 'em.  I don't always agree with the lyrics but I didn't always agree with Pete Townshend when I was a kid, either.  Don't get me wrong, I know Bush is an idiot.  I love rock music and this is ROCK MUSIC.
B0000024K1|4.0|Now I'm not a big fan of rap music, for the most part I can't stand it, but this is one of the few rap records which I can listen to and enjoy to some extent. Public Enemy don't spend the entire duration of the record talking about how gangsta they are, they use their music to try and influence people and take on different issues. As I'm not a fan of rap in general, I don't know the exact context of this release and just how much of an influence it had on later hip-hop, but I do know that it was influential and controversial at the same time. Nevertheless, they can be as influential as they want, but if the music is boring and generic rap, I'm not going to like it. That's the difference between this and other rap I've heard...it's just for some reason more enjoyable. <br /> <br />I think this is something that everyone in the world needs to hear at some point, not just rap or hip-hop fans, anyone. It's the sort of record that you might like to some degree, even if you despise all the other rap you've ever heard. If you don't like it, fine, it's never going to be one of my favourite CDs, but check it out just so you can be sure, songs like \\"Don't Believe The Hype\\" and \\"Bring The Noise\\" are pretty good. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's even funnier when you know Preston, ID.  I think the people who gave it only one star and are criticizing the people that liked it are just a little too anal.  My 69-year-old mom laughed her butt off!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Terrific!!! Sorry, I'm still mesmerized. I just watched this movie for the fifth time and it still amazes me. The humor is dark but so much to the point and close to real life that you'll look at your life differently from the moment you finished watching this one. The actors are perfectly casted for their roles. Each and every one of them fits his/hers better than a glove. The storyline with all its twists and turns, the laughter and the tears - wonderful. If ever you'd want to compare it to something else - which is difficult because it's so unique - the Coen brothers and Robert Altman come to mind. But as I said before, this one is truely one of a kind. Paul Thomas Anderson's unique ironic view of reality will stay with me for the rest of my life.
0375432302|5.0|I could not put this book down. It made me proud to be a woman ;o) I think that it is a must read for every one.
B0002IU988|5.0|I didn't like Creed too much, and expected Alter Bridge to be similar, but it turned out that Alter Bridge is almost completely different and a million times better.  I've only listened to this album for a day now and it really really kicks ass.  \\"One Day Remains\\" is one of the coolest songs I've EVER heard (awesome guitar work, awesome melodies, and good message too).  I have a lot of hope for this band, based on this, their debut cd.  Buy it!
B0000048V8|5.0|Nice gentle music, beautiful videography, sweet story.  Perfect for winding down after a bath before bed- our 18 month old adores it and we do too.
B00005ASHM|5.0|this would be the first album i would bring. how do you give it less than 4 stars. it has been proven one of the best albums of all time. anybody who gives it less than 4 stars is ignorant on the making of the album. the time, thaught and work he put into this album. amazing. harmonies on sloop john  b: the best. the tracks are timeless. crazy bass lines that were way ahead of their time. you will love this album and if you dont, do your research. you will find that the work put into the album is amazing and easily the greatest album of all time...ever.
B000069HK2|5.0|It's just amazing when a band just comes out with something that is so heartfelt and so real it's hard to describe it. The Used, unlike any band I have ever heard in my life, have taken the truest example of raw emotion and intensity and fused into the most incredible musical experience I have ever heard. There are many bands people say that you could compare to \\"the used\\", but after a few listens you come to realize that this is something else entirely. You literally feel like you can come to know Bert McCracken almost personally through this masterpiece. I can't even really put my finger on what makes this cd so incredible except that it just is. One time I had locked my self into my room with the lights off and endured the entire mind blowing experience with my headphones cranked, and found myself relating to this cd in a way that I thought would be impossible. Frequent times I had goose bumps up my whole body just listening Bert's shrill gut wrenching screams. Most music seems to try and fit into a certain genre/category or aim at trying to reach a certain kind of sound. Maybe Memories comes from with inside as a true expression of self. Its like Bert just opened up his soul and showed everyone what he is truly feeling. I can't say enough or find the words to describe what this cd is like, you just have to buy it and see for yourself.
B00005JNPZ|1.0|Using this simple formula you can tell just how bad a \\"chick flick\\" will be for a guy to have to sit through. Add together the number of 1960's R&B tunes (double the points if tunes are used in a wacky lip-synch routine by one of the cast, or if cast members suddenly start serenading star with a 1960's song). Mulitply the number of songs by the number of \\"gay comic relief\\" characters in the movie. The formula might look something like this: Otis Redding + Aretha Franklin + Marvin Gaye + Van Morrison x 3-Gay Comic Relief = Get the Hell Out of the Theater NOW!! If you score above 10 points with this formuala.....leave the theater immediately, run home, and pop in an emergency copy of \\"Die Hard\\" kept close at hand for just this situation. \\"Hitch\\" is 100% pure Chick-Flick, my bag of popcorn came with breasts!!! The ads for this movie focused only on the funny scenes with Kevin James, who is actually only in the film for about 20 minutes, the majority of movie really focuses around Will Smith trying to seduce the too manly and often scary lead actress!! The movie is long, boring, full of every romantic movie cliche, I think this story was actually an old plot line from \\"The Love Boat\\"...in short...I had a great time watching \\"Die Hard\\" last night.
B00068IOWC|4.0|People, people, people.  I've read some of the one-star reviews from the bitter fans of the \\"old\\" U2, and quite frankly, I'm exhausted.  Not so much because you are incorrect (although you are on several fronts), just that you chose to live in the past and expect your beloved U2 of the \\"Joshua Tree\\" era to remain frozen in time right along with you.   <br /> <br />Yes, several songs on \\"How to Dismantle...\\" share the same musical soul with other U2 songs.  This is not without precedent.  Give a close listen to \\"Achtung Baby\\" and you will find that several songs on that \\"groundbreaking\\" album share the same chord progressions with songs from \\"Joshua Tree\\" (music theory lessons, anyone?).  I don't find this to be bad or annoying at all.  U2 has a unique sound and I don't find it irritating to hear ties to past in present music.   <br /> <br />As for lyrical \\"subtlety\\" or too much \\"literality\\" in their current songwriting, well, I find that to be hogwash.  You can go back to any U2 album and find examples of both \\"poetic\\" licence and in-your-face, no-doubt-about-it assaults.  Does anyone remember Sunday, Bloody Sunday for Pete's sake??  While we're on Pete's sake, please know what you're talking about when you talk about the meaning of a song.  \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is not a love song at all.   <br /> <br />U2 chose long ago to recognize the fact that they were not a \\"small stage\\" band anymore (watch Rattle and Hum vs. today's shows).  Sometimes being on a bigger stage is both literal and applicable to the broader sense of the word \\"stage\\".  Maybe it's the fact that some fans didn't like them getting more popular, that U2 didn't just belong to \\"them\\" anymore.  Maybe it's the fact that bouncing onto a bigger stage just screams \\"sellout\\" to some people.  If that's the case, find a small band playing in small clubs that you like, too.  <br /> <br />Given all the changes and metamorpheses U2 has undergone through the years, though, one thing remains the same.  They arethe brightest light (and to me, frankly, the only bright light) in anything resembling \\"popular music\\" today.  This album is no exception.  At first, I didn't make it much past the first four songs because I wanted to keep playing them over and over.  Now, upon multiple listenings, I can't wait to get to the songs on the last two thirds of the album.  The writing, both lyrically and musically is unmistakably U2,and that is said in the best sense possible. <br /> <br />As for Grammy's, SNL, and the like, I look at it this way.  If I'm watching such a program (sorry, I missed the Grammy's), I would much rather see a band of musical quality (Wilco, anyone?) end up on a show like that than another rehash of Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and the Dixie Chicks.  Jesus chose to hang with the sinners, too.  Anything that brings the quality up a notch (or several), is OK in my book. <br /> <br />Overall impression of the album:  another solid block of songs from a group mastering their own sound on their own terms. <br /> <br />Overall impression of the fans having a problem with how they handle their own success:  lock yourselves in a room with a good, old U2 cd and cable tv that will bring you an endless stream of \\"Remember the 80's\\" (or 90's, as the case may be).  Living in the past doesn't help the world progress.
B00003CXCT|5.0|To all the crybabies who can't get their original untouched version of Star Wars on dvd: Too bad!  Star Wars fans are notoriously fickle about the way any Star Wars merchandise be handled, whether it be the books, video games, etc.  <br /> <br />I remember first watching Star Wars back in the late 80's (I was born in '84) and how I instantly fell in love with the universe.  I'd watch the film on VHS regularly until they just wore out.  When the 20th anniversary special editions came out in 1997 with additional scenes and minor touch ups, I was surprised just as much as anyone else.  Unlike anyone else, I welcomed the scenes.  Okay - some were a little corny.  For example the Greedo scene was just downright terrible and Luke's scream in The Empire Strikes Back was laughable.  Thankfully these were fixed up in the DVD editions; you can actually stomach the Greedo scene now. <br /> <br />The new touch ups and additional scenes were not intended to scam anyone.  Unlike most director's cuts, the new scenes really do enhance the film experience.  Lucas always intended to have the Han/Jaba confrontation in A New Hope; he always intended for a more spectacular end celebration on Return of the Jedi.   His only reason for not having those scenes in the original releases were because he simply ran out of money and time.  Therefore, I respect Lucas' decision to change whatever he felt necessary to change - afterall, are these not his films?  If Lucas wanted to do further additions to the movie featuring the cast digitally modified as clowns, then so be it.   <br /> <br />If you want the originals, they're still available on VHS.  If you want to live the old memories of originals, it's still on VHS.  If you want ugly, unrestored, low-quality sound entertainment, oh my - it's still on VHS!  I highly doubt anyone at LucasFilm is going to waste their time and money restoring the originals to DVD.   <br /> <br />But for the rest of us who have moved on to the 21st century, the new DVDs are wonderfully done.  The pictures are cleaned and polished.  In many cases, they look far more crisp than the films produced today.  The dolby 5.1 surround is a nice addition too.  I can finally hear the engines and blasters roaring all around me.  It does make the difference from the mono VHS versions...but then again, we'll just leave that to the folks who want to reminisce of the old days.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Before I saw this movie I knew very little about Frida and after seeing the movie I was compelled to find out a little more about her. I was very surprised to find much of what the movie showed you actually happened to her. It is a very artistically visual film that shows you the best and worst sides of the characters, which often in movies you see too much of the glamorized versions of people. I really wasn't thrilled when my wife wanted me to see this film, but I'm really glad we rented it because I ended up buying it, it is a film worth owning just so you can learn about the artist and hopefully it will make you go buy some of her books so you can learn even more about this amazing artist.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Alicia Keys for about a year I guess. I loved her debut album and I love this album as well. She has many great hits on here like \\"Karma\\", \\"If i aint got you\\" and \\"if i was your woman/walk on by\\" her voice is great and she definitley embdoies all of R&B there were just one or two songs I didn't really like on the album. Such as \\"Diary\\" for the most part it was a great 15 songs but 1 or 2 were'nt exactly the greatest but overall i would give this a 9 out of 10. 4 stars! If you love Alicia Keys and great R&B buy this c-d!
1569382603|5.0|+++++<br /><br />Journalist and author Graham Hancock takes us around the world re-examining ancient mysteries and asking puzzling but pertinent questions as he does so.  As well, he raises his own speculation and theories as to possibly what really happened.<br /><br />You will find that the three programs that make up this boxed set touch on many areas such as archaeology, astronomy, mathematics, geology, geophysics, engineering, mythology, climatology, art, and ancient history.  All important concepts concerned with in these areas are well explained with the aid of computer graphics, simulation, and animation.  Photography of ancient art, artifacts, and the exterior & interior of ancient ruins is superbly done.<br /><br />What is fantastic about these programs is that the viewer feels that he is exploring along with Hancock as well as experiencing the sense of mystery and awe that Hancock is probably experiencing.<br /><br />There is brief commentary given by experts such as Egyptologists, geologists, engineers, and mythologists.  There is even a brief rebuttal to Hancock's beliefs by experts, such as the Director of the Egyptian pyramids.<br /><br />Areas of the world Hancock investigates include Southern Europe, Egypt, Cambodia, Mexico, Japan's Pacific Islands, Micronesia, and Easter Island.<br /><br />Each program begins with a brief introduction that I will reproduce here:<br /><br />Program #1 entitled Heaven's Mirror.  (This is the most interesting program in my<br />opinion.)<br /><br />\\"We're off the coast of the Southern most tip of Japan.  I've come to investigate an underwater mystery that could simply rewrite history.  This looks like a temple but the last time it was above water was ten thousand years ago.  If it is man-made, it's the oldest known structure on Earth.  I believe it could prove the existence of a lost civilization.\\"<br /><br />Program #2: Forgotten Knowledge.<br /><br />\\"The Nazca lines in Peru are the biggest drawings in the world.  So big, we can only view them complete from the air.  Etched in the desert at least two thousand years ago, they must be of a civilization of astronomers.  They turn out to be ground maps of the stars, exact representations of the night sky.\\"<br /><br />Program #3: Ancient Mariners.<br /><br />\\"Easter Island statues could hold the secret of what happened in the world before history began.  Why did ancient cultures with no known contacts have so much in common?  My theory is they derived from a common source: a single, lost<br />civilization.\\"<br /><br />These programs mention nothing about UFOs or LGM (little green men).  They present a serious, scientific investigation.<br /><br />Finally, I also recommend the program \\"The Mystery of the Sphinx\\" (1993) hosted by Charlton Heston and Hancock's book \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\" (1995).<br /><br />In conclusion, these programs present to the viewer unanswered questions about ancient mysteries.  If you like mysteries like I do, then you must view these programs!!<br /><br />(1998; 3 videotapes of 50 min each; made for TV; full screen)<br /><br />+++++o big, we can only view them complete from the air.

B0007OCG56|1.0|The only believable thing about this movie is that it was made in Hollywood.  Who the hell thought of casting Paz Vega as a Mexican maid?  That would be believable only if she were an upper-class woman who went bankrupt or that for some reason had to assume a new identity.  Go ahead and check every damn house in L.A. and find me a maid that looks like that--as white, as sophisticated, and as beautiful.  Ludicrous.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Paul Newman and Robert Redford became mega stars with this 1969 film as the legendary outlaws.  What makes this film great is the unforgettable lines.<br /><br />\\"...the first thing to remember is there are no rules.\\",<br /><br />\\"I CAN'T SWIM\\",  \\"are you kidding me...the fall alone will kill ya!!\\"<br /><br />\\"Who are these guys?\\"<br /><br />The interraction between the two makes this great cinema.  George Roy Hill gives a great directing job and would be rewarded 4 years later with Newman & Redford at the helm on \\"The Sting\\".  Add this to your western collection!
B00002E23E|5.0|I don't know why I do this, just because I'm a Zepplein freak I guess.  I just can't let another \\"Zeppelin weren't very good this night\\" comment slide.  People who write that just don't know what they are talking about, period.  Yes, we thankfully have the new DVD, and the West Was Won CD, but to say that they couldn't cut it on Song Remains Same is just a flat out LIE.  To be fair, YES, there is some cutting of performances using video footage from different nights and things like that, and there is the \\"fantasy\\" footage that may or may not bug you.  BUT, there is plenty of live music and live video to show you Zeppelin flying high in all of its glory!  The bow sequence alone during Dazed is EPIC, Jimmy is channeling the music from somewhere, who knows where!  Anyway you cut it, the band is in AMAZING form, pure and simple, and if you are unable to be moved by this performance, that is ok I guess, but you should stick to your Sinead O'Connor records and other \\"brilliant\\" \\"artists\\" of the like.
B00067BBQE|3.0|I'm a huge Evanescence fan but the concert footage is so unwatchable that I could only watch short segments at a time.  This defect has been commented in other reviews so I won't go into it any more.  The concert CD, music videos, and backstage videos are the stars of this combo.  For concert footage, much better are their European concerts (if you can find them on Ebay or elsewhere), especially their 2003 Rock Am Ring concert or their Pink Pop Festival concert.  I don't know much about their new guitarist but I really miss Ben Moody.
B0002CHHMA|5.0|I encountered Carla Bruni pretty much by chance, because somebody happened to mention listening to the song \\"Quelqu'un M'a Dit\\" on the radio and he asked me to translate it since I speak French. I am so glad he asked this favor of me, because the song is now one of my favorites. It is incredibly beautiful in a mellow, hopeful, and loving way. Definitely a song I never mind having stuck in my head. After hearing that, I decided I wanted to hear more of Carla Bruni's work. While \\"Quelqu'un M'a Dit\\" is still probably my favorite song on the CD, I love the entire thing. There is some great variety. Some of the music is more upbeat. You can definitely enjoy the CD if you don't speak French (several of my friends are now addicted to her music even though they don't know what she's singing), but if you do speak French, it's an even better treat. I adore her lyrics. They are very catchy, meaningful, and clever. I highly recommend this CD!
0385510454|2.0|What starts out as a decent plot quickly turns in to a travel log of Italy.  I though the ending might at least save the book --but no, that was disappointing too.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I LOVED this movie!!!  There were so many halarious and notable quotes, and the repeat dialouge made it one of my favorite movies EVER!!!  Watch this movie; you won't be disappointed!!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I found it stunning that Francis Ford Coppola was disappointed with THE GODFATHER.  While other 70's super directors like William Friedkin won an Oscar for THE FRENCH CONNECTION, Coppola moaned during the editing of the first film, \\"I've made a movie about a bunch of guys talking in dark rooms.\\"<br /><br />He just didn't know what he had.  (And, after listening to his commentaries, maybe he even now STILL doubts his accomplishments).<br /><br />The first and second GODFATHER films are genuine American masterpieces.  Everything works.  The DVD extras are great.  The casting, the writing, the cinematography, the music--it just all works.  You hear the word \\"Shakespearean\\" brought up a lot about the first two GODFATHER films, and I agree that they both reach those heights.<br /><br />The third film is like the Fredo of the trilogy: \\"It's got a good heart, but it's weak and stupid.\\"  Does anyone honestly believe that Michael would suddenly start trying to win Kaye back?  (She's lucky she didn't end up at the bottom of Lake Tahoe herself!).<br /><br />I'd always heard that Paramount asked Coppola for a third GODFATHER, and he said give me six months to write the script.  Paramount said you've got six weeks.  GODFATHER III plays like a rough draft of something that might have worked.  But definitely doesn't.<br /><br />The movie comes alive for Andy Garcia's first scenes (as Sonny's illegitimate son), but then it just falls apart.<br /><br />But I do have to say: everyone complained about Sofia Coppola jumping into the role of Michael's daughter when Winona Ryder dropped out (I couldn't see her anyway), but I actually thought Sofia looked and acted the part perfectly.<br /><br />(I mean, if the studio had had their way with the first film, Charlton Heston would've been Vito and Ryan O'Neal would've been Michael!).
068987474X|2.0|This is another one of those \\"self help\\" books that gives extreme examples and overlooks the subtleties of interpersonal relationships when it comes to dating. This book reminds me of \\"The Rules.\\" It's just worded differently. The thing I like about this book is that it tells women that they deserve the best. Do not settle for less than that. You are beautiful and smart and a real catch. But, why would you need a book to tell you that? <br /> <br />At first I was reading this book and feeling smothered by the men Greg was talking about. With further introspection, I can take his advice and wait for the guy that does what he says without making me feel like running for my life. I am thankful for Liz's section of this book, but I don't think that she does enough to even his tone. If you can find the \\"sane\\" ground (this is the difficult part) and the real message behind what is being said in the book, I agree with it 100%. I have always said that men enjoy the chase. It is somehow fun to them and it makes them feel like they have worked hard for you and therefore you are worth more to them. Since you are worth more to them, they are willing to do more to keep you. Most importantly, women should not let men treat them badly. Don't let the excuses stop you from demanding to be treated the way you want to be treated. I am talking about anything from \\"when or how often he calls, how often you have sex, whether or not he is  ready to get married\\" to \\"he's a selfish jerk, he tells you you're fat, or he's married.\\" <br /> <br />As with \\"The Rules,\\" I find that this book assumes that women just want a man, any man, that will marry them and then life will be \\"Happily Ever After.\\" Sure, there are thousands of single men out there. The problem is that I am not looking for ANY one of them; I am looking for someone that is compatible with me. Someone with a similar sense of humor, similar interests, similar values, is drop dead gorgeous and so many other things. That man is not soeasy to find. I want a man who loves me for me, not because I am a prize for work well done. <br /> <br />Sure, the letters that are included in the book are written by women who should do exactly as Greg suggests. Nikki is nuts. There are jerks out there, and I am amazed when women stay with them. I have more than one friend (and yes, even myself, once or twice) who has been so in love with a man that she can't see the obvious signs. Every one of those relationships (save one, and I am still waiting for it to happen) has ended. They usually end after a significant amount of time has passed. Have these women lost (or wasted) valuable time? I suppose that goes back to a woman's attitude. I think the biological clock plays a nasty part in this. I have learned something and gained something from almost every relationship I have been in. Sometimes, it just takes time after the breakup to acknowledge it. For those relationships, I am glad that I didn't just dump him at the first sign that he \\"Wasn't that into me,\\" as Greg suggests you do. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a husband, there are things in this book that will help you get there. But, if you are just looking for a \\"relationship for now,\\" you can ease them a little. Ok, so I am talking about us \\"Samantha's\\" of the world. Most of you are looking for a real, long term relationship and that is who this book is geared for.  <br /> <br />Ok, so I think Greg is a little harsh. I don't know that I agree with his \\"black and white\\" as Liz puts it. I do, however, think that he makes perfect sense. I think it should all be \\"common sense.\\" Too bad it isn't always. <br /> <br />I hope you are not one of the women out there that needs a book to tell you this, but Greg is absolutely right when he writes: <br /> <br />\\"You are better than all the crap you've been taking from all these men all these years. You are an excellent, foxy human being worthy of love, and the only way you can pursue that idea is by honoring yourself.\\" <br /> <br />That is about all this book says and about all it is worth. If you need to hear this, then this book is for you.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I am completely baffled by the fact that this film ended up being intelligently written, well-acted, and totally unpredictable.  The only real negative I experienced during the film is that there are a few moments where I wanted the story to go a bit faster, the pace quickened for my own personal satisfaction, but as the final scene unfolded and a sinister grin crept across my face, all was forgiven.  I am shocked.  Once in a while a movie comes out that is destroyed by the critics and I have a serious time figuring out why.  The acting here is solid, lead by a cast of pros including Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, and Monica Potter.  The other cast members are all surprisingly good, particularly screenwriter/actor Leigh Whannell who plays the other man trapped in the room with Cary Elwes; and Makenzie Vega who plays the young daughter of Cary Elwes' character.  That little girl often shows up every other actor in the movie, and the cast is very strong besides.  The story begins with a man who awakens to find himself chained to a large steel pipe.  He is in an enclosed room with only one other occupant who is also chained on the other side of the room.  Essentially, this story starts in the middle for these two characters where they gradually figure out why they are there.  In the meantime, other characters are out there somewhere who are either wrapped up in the macabre happenings or are potential victims of the diabolical charade.  While this film is certainly no masterpiece, it does flirt with greatness time and again enough to merit a quality rating.  By the time the credits were rolling I was smiling with surprise and secretly cursing myself for ever listening to the so-called \\"professional\\" critics who put down this film.  As far as Horror films go, \\"Saw\\" is a diamond in the rough.
044024157X|5.0|Spending much of the first of the year traveling, I took along a stack of books.  The Last Juror was on the bottom of the stack as far as books to read.  By the end of the book, I was very disappointed that I had reached the end. Though I had read a number of Grisham's earlier books, I have not kept up with his later novels.<br /><br />At times I found myself comparing the leisurely Southern pace of the novel and the character development to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, but there was an underlying anticipation throughout the book.<br /><br />I found the main characters, Willie Traynor and Callie Ruffin, very compelling and likeable.  I identified personally with life in a small Southern town and saw much of my own family in the various characters found in the South.<br /><br />This is truly one of Grisham's best books and by far my favorite.

B0006SSOHC|2.0|As a rule, the odds of discovering a gem in an increasingly lackluster genre of horror are rather small.  More often than not, these hopefuls turn out to be shallow and laughable (to use an epithet so abhorred by the director of Ju-On on his commentary to the deleted scenes).  It is with great regret that I must inform all those curious souls who discern quality, that \\"Saw\\" is pretty much glorified trash.  It was a shock to see Danny Glover take part in this production, and a shame that even in this obscure flick, his part was reduced to the elemental obsessive cop personality.  That, in turn, left much space for the horrendous \\"Westley\\" (a memorable role in \\"The Princess Bride\\") to deliver most ridiculous lines and, nearing the dubious conclusion, incessant and annoying sobbing .  All in all -- don't bother.  As for some arcane comparisons to \\"Seven\\" -- not even close.  The integrity of the cast and the filmmaking in the latter is far beyond \\"Saw's\\" range, aside from the fact that \\"Seven\\" came out some 10 years ago.  Better luck next time.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Anybody who is going to bash this record cause they're a bush supporter is an idiot.  Plain and simple.  This album is not only a politically charged frenzy, but it's a commentary on life in this country in general.  It's not just anti-bush, it's anti-fantasty.  A lot of us in this country have come up with these fairy tale ideas of the \\"american dream\\" but for some that will plain and simple never come true.  That's just life.  The lyrics while not being the most intelligent words possible, are brilliant...hands down, and the best lyrics on the album are definitely in the song holiday.  And what's wrong with freedom of speech?  Isn't that what this country was founded on?  Stop being such hypocrites just cause you don't have the guts to either know the truth behind the issues, or to speak your mind.  They've done it, they've done it brilliantly, and this album is worth so much more than just a disgusted look because it has a title of \\"American Idiot.\\"  It's not talking about America (the one that our forefathers planned for us) it's talking about George W.'s vision of America, and they don't agree with it, and neither does half this country, stop being so narrowminded.

This is the Hotel California of the modern era.  An album that will go down in history as one of the best ever made.  It's amazing...The country re-elects a liar into the whitehouse, but the number 1 album in the country for weeks is Anti-dubya.  Go f***ing figure.  This album rocks!  And sends an eerie message if you are articulate enough to know what it means.  Green Day Rules!!!  Go buy it and stand up for the REAL American way!
0316236535|5.0|Show the monster in your life who's boss with this delightful picture book from Ed Emberly! A book perfect for your youngster who might dread the thing that goes bump in the night or wonder what lurks under their bed, this book takes a rather direct approach to summoning, then banishing the monster, and empowering a child to do the same.<br /><br />The book itself is a wonderful example of a \\"movable book\\" in that the pages are designed to slowly reveal the face of a rather cartoonish monster through cut outs, so that the face is gradually revealed.  Starting with two \\"big yellow eyes\\", the pages progress through adding a mouth and nose and hair, until children can perceive the entire face of the monster.  Then the same process is done in reverse, with pieces of the monster disappearing as the text commands those pieces to go away, until the monster is gone.  This Cheshire cat-like visual trick is used effectively, and will not only give children some sense of power over the monster, but allows them to guess what will appear or disappear next, and to grasp the sense of shapes and color that make up the monster.<br /><br />The text is simple fairly large and appealing white text on a vividly colored page.  When the monster is being assembled, children can become familiar with the adjectives and colors used to describe each part.  The \\"big yellow eyes\\", the \\"long bluish-greenish nose\\", the \\"purple squiggly hair\\" and so forth.  As the monster is disassembled, the words \\"Go Away\\" are repeated on each page, larger than the rest of the text, and each command ends with an exclamation point, reinforcing the fact that the reader is telling the monster what to do. The last page declares \\"And don't come back!\\" with a smaller admission of \\"Until I say so.\\" Giving children complete control of the situation, and potentially encouraging them to go through the book again when they choose to. The pages in the hardcover edition are very sturdy and stiff, which is helpful when the book contains cutouts.  It's not likely to rip or tear easily, even if young hands are turning the pages.<br /><br />I personally love this book, and know many kids that enjoy it, but it may be too scary for your child if they aren't ready for it.  Despite it's cartoonish appearance, the monster does have \\"big sharp teeth\\" and could unnerve younger children.  You might want to discuss the book with them first, and see if they think they will be too scared or not-kids are pretty good at deciding that sort of thing. If the child is unsure, it may be better to wait until they are ready.  The power of this book is giving children control over the monsters they might imagine, and in providing a visual game of pictures that they can play again and again.  If you like this book and you're looking for others that deal with monsters and scary things, you might try THERE'S A NIGHTMARE IN MY CLOSET by Mercer Mayer, THERE'S A MONSTER UNDER MY BED by James Howe and WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE by Maurice Sendak.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^  Shanshade book contains cutouts.

0060763280|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I listended to T. Harv Eker's teleseminar several months ago and have been anxiously awaiting this book so I could learn more ways to implement his advice.  The information challenges readers to think about how experiences have trained you to view money and wealth. The suggestions about 'why knowledge and skills do not create wealth' were especially interesting.  <br /> <br />I noticed a difference as soon as I began to pay attention to the areas that were described in the sections about what works for and against financial goals.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|This movie is getting alot of critique here at amazon.  Another one of those fringe films everyone has an opinion on.  Some of the supporters are obvious gothic horror film freeks who like anything with wowzer special affects.  Some of the detracters just can't enjoy a film that is'nt \\"highly acclaimed\\".<br /><br />  Well, I fall between these two extremes.  Here's my take on this highly watchable \\"horror/action/gothic/Matrix\\" wanna-be;<br /><br />-Obviously \\"The Matrix\\" series (and it's financial success) had allot to do with this getting made.  I would call this the horror equivelent to \\"The Matrix\\" series.<br /><br />-Now some are crying fowel. But this film gets criticized for the exact thing that \\"The Matrix\\" does; THE STORY HAD INFINITE BUT FAILED POTENTIAL.<br /><br />-Actually, I think if \\"The Matrix\\" stopped at the first film, it would have been more impressive.  \\"Underworld\\" has a less flawed story than the 2 \\"Matrix\\" sequals.<br /><br />-Say what you will, the special affects are pretty cool.  This is how this film got most peoples attention in the first place.<br /><br />-Miss Beckinsale is quite fetching in her costume... hey, you can't argue!<br /><br />-The vampires (other than Kate) seemed a little too whimpy.  For the most part, they get trounced.<br /><br />-The stories biggest flaw: Using guns to do most of the fighting.  These are supernatural creatures,  LET THEM DUKE IT OUT!!<br /><br />-I did not know that vampires could act in a consious manner with their brains detached from their bodies.  Just nit-picky I guess.<br /><br />-I really enjoyed this film on a visual level.  They obviously were going for allot of \\"posed\\" imagry.<br /><br />-Most reviewers are correct when they say you don't care much for either side.  HOW COULD YOU!!  THEY ARE, BY DEFINITION, SCARY MONSTERS THAT EAT US!!<br /><br />-The DVD is adequate for the \\"not-the-directors-unrated-cut-super-special-edition\\".  For what I paid (NOT $15) I'm happy.<br /><br />The bottom line:  I actually was very afraid to buy this based on the mixed reviews.  So, I waited for a really good sale.  I'm happy with my purchase.  Not a great film but entertaining.  It will be fun to watch around Halloween.  Given the premise, most people with a fair imagination could have come up with much more dynamic and quality alternative story-line.  But I am much less disturbed by this than the \\"matrix\\" sequals (which I also enjoyed quite a bit).  If you can't get over that part of it, then I would'nt recommend it.  Borrow or rent first.the mixed reviews.  So, I waited for a really good sale.  I'm happy with my purchase.  Not a great film but entertaining.  It will be fun to watch around Halloween.

B0000931QA|5.0|There's a theroy held common by many people that when your favorite band reaches it's \\"concept album\\" phase to look the other way because the band is going downhill. On the other hand, there are a group of people who are enamoured by the concept of a concept album and immediatly proclaim that album a \\"triumph\\" and that particular artist's \\"masterpiece\\". With all that baggauge attached the term \\"concept album\\" it's a wonder any good ones are made.But that is the case with Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime.In fact, besides Pink Floyd's The Wall this is the best concept album ever made. Let me clarify, Sgt. Pepper is not a concept album, neither is Dark Side Of The Moon, 2112, Hemispheres, American Idiot etcetera etcetera. A concept album as I understand it is a progressing story that becomes more defined by each song. When someone calls OK Computer a great concept album I want to wring ther necks because it is NOT a concept album. This is great because it doesn't suffer the pitfalls of many concept albums like when song does not progress the story or when the story is so confusing you can't follow it. Sure, there are great stand out songs on this album like Eyes Of A Stranger, I Don't Believe In Love, Revolution Calling that don't require knowing the story to appreciate. But you have to know the story to apprciate Suite Sister Mary which is arguably the best song on the album. In a nutshell that's what makes this a superior concept allbum. The fact that Queensryche is a great band doesn't hurt much either.
B00005JMXX|3.0|B. Souter (canberra, ACT Australia) wrote in his review:<br /><br />\\"The reviewer who thinks the US govt shoudlnt be criticised probably forgets the US is supposed to be a liberal democracy....and that criticism is a necessary feature of a democracy.\\"<br /><br />For his information as well as the information of others who may be confused about this,the United States is NOT and never has been a democracy,liberal or otherwise. What we are and always have been is a Constitutional Republic. Any of you who think this is minor nitpicking need to investigate the difference between the two.<br /><br />BTW,I haven't viewed the movie. I rated it at 3 stars so as to not be unfair to it when posting this correction.
B0002X314C|5.0|I have played this CD at least once a day since I purchased it.John Ledgend's music ha such an honesty to it that you simply must respond to it.  He is truly that brother that everybody knows yet no one really knows.  Yes, he sleeps around but he really does believe in love.  His music Takes you to the club to private time with your sweetie to relationship woes to your family reunion.  He's also not formulamatic but has produced an album that is truly soul music.  If you like D'angelo, Dwele, Anthony Hamilton or any brothers making real music, you need to add this album to your collection.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Probably the real review is \\"They didn't make it for me\\" but I'm pretty sure that a lot of folks who enjoy the odd little film now and then might be tempted to get this one and be disappointed.<br /><br />It struck me as a movie that Woody Allen might have done as a young man if he had all his current angst and issues then, and hadn't started on therapy yet.  I'm sure that the \\"human condition\\" story of Sad Sack Napoleon will be of interest to some, but not to many.  Certainly not to me.<br /><br />It's a lot like listening to someone else's therapy session about a particularly awkward adolescence.  2 stars because it's well done for what it is.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This album is totally aweome! All the songs are worth listening to and not a waste of listening time! A must for any Manson fan or someone trying out new music!! The songs on here are really good! They are a great example of Rock n' Roll or Shock Rock! There are no other words to say about this album other than Amazing!! It's, like, my favorite album out of all of them!! I suggest this be the first Manson album for you to buy! It kicks some totally major ASS!!!
B000059RL3|5.0|I didnt really know any of Marvins music before i bought this cd for the original album but i got a big shock.  <br /> <br />I can proclaim without doubt that the detroit mix is better than the final product.  <br /> <br />clarity in the lyrics is lost in final production, the extra layers of sound (ie strings) mess up the drums (bongos) and piano that marvin and the original session artists must have used for the original detriot recording tracks. <br /> <br />Buy this cd for the detroit mix. Its extremely good music. Its basically the finished album but extended with excellent inprovisations.  <br /> <br />Marvin sounds better (the stereo mixing is really good) and takes more time to get his songs out. This CD is one of the best i have listerned too. Rate it with pet sounds in terms of complete package.  <br /> <br />
B00009P1MP|5.0|don is one of the bestest singers,american pie is a song that will be in our hearts forever,but,Vincent is a great song,i think there is a tie betwen american pie(a classic)and vincent(a fantastic song)but i tell you buy this cd,you will hear all day long and.........rock and roll!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Jimmi was one of the best, and this album proves it.  Hard rock, slow music, experimental rock, it's all here and Jimmi plays it all with passion and innate talent.  All tracks are outstanding.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice is a classic example of an underrated artist with the craft and talent. O is a stellar case of why people like Usher and Alicia Keys etc. are overrated.<br /><br />His closest contemporary could be David Gray but Damien Rice sounds even rawer very often with lush orchestration and a powerful emotive voice that resonates with each song.<br /><br />The songs may sound heartwrenching but it's really Rice's bittersweet voice that makes each song shine the way they are. The opener Delicate starts off slowly but breaks into a high in the middle complete with a very solid string section. The album contains other gems such as Volcano, The Blower's Daughter (heard in the film Closer), Canonball. Finally, on Eskimo, Rice fuses a whimsical, almost fairy tale-like tune with an opera segment to good effect and closes the album perfectly. Not quite, there's still two bonus tracks culminating in an excellent re-worked version of Silent Night by Lisa Hannigan.<br /><br />For the most part, these songs can't be simple described. Sparse in production but so richly emotional on many layers, lyrically and musically. Only an artist of such artistry could deliver. Of course, credits must also be given to those working with him - Lisa Hannigan (vocals) and Vyvienne Long (cello).<br /><br />O isn't for everyone to swallow, but if you do find your way to, it's a satisfying and often rewarding treat.
B000001FFJ|4.0|The beggining of Tom's first change.  He has gone through so many it's easy to lose count.  Weird yet beatufil album, hunting melodies and new sounds along with Tom's original formula.  Stand out tracks include \\"hang down your head\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Rain Dogs\\", the strange, short and amazing \\"9th and Hennepin\\" and the marvelous \\"Downtown TRain\\".

B000002GY9|5.0|Beautiful recording.  Tom's growl over his melancholic piano playing is pure genious.  This album has that down-in-the-gutter feel to it, you get transported to those old bars where Tom used to play. If you like Tom's early work this is definately an album you should get.
0451191153|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I had been meaning to read it for some time, and in the barracks I was staying in (I am a reservist called back to active duty in the army) I found it in a locker.  I immediately read it and liked it so much I purchased several of Rand's other books. <br /> <br />The premise of the story is one man's unwillingness to compromise his work for the tastes of the general public.  He would not conform, and he would not waver in his beliefs, regardless of the personal and professional set backs they caused him.  He was an architect and created buildings of a type that had never been seen before.  The \\"masses\\" didn't know how to take the radical new design and they waited for the critics to tell them what to think.  What results from this is actually the more interesting story, that of the antagonist Ellsworth Toohey, a very cunning, dignified man who undertook as his mission in life controlling the thought of the people. <br /> <br />Unlike Atlas Shrugged, the characters here have a considerable amount of depth and complexities.  Rand dedicates ample space defining the characters and giving you an insight into previous life changing events, which is something she neglected to do in Atlas Shrugged.  No character is pure of either defects or attributes.  This makes for very intriguing story.    <br /> <br />One draw back, as outlined by previous reviewers, is the unlikely conversations held between the characters, or \\"speeches\\" as one reviewer put it.  But, as in all of Rand's fiction writing, the story is a mere means to the end, and in this case the end is a homage to the power and creativity of the individual.  There may be a way to have expressed it in witty banter between characters, but I am not sure it would exhibit Rand's points more clearly.  <br /> <br />Overall, it was a very enjoyable book, both for the philosophies it expounded and for the story itself. <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|First of all, no, Evanescence is not Gothic rock. Second of all: IT DOES NOT MATTER ONE LITTLE BIT! The entire controversy surrounding this band has been a fight over whether or not they are really gothic or posers or whatnot, and the fact is that it flat out does not matter. They make incredible, original music that is great to listen to, and that is what makes this band so awesome. I must say that when I first heard about them, I was rather skepticle, because I have heard of very few good rock bands that front a female as their lead singer. However, when I borrowed this cd from one of my friends, I was astounded: Amy Lee's voice is incredible, and it blends powerfully with the steady guitar work and deep base that form the feeling of despair and urgency that is what Evanescence is all about. Now for the songs <br /> <br />1) Going Under: The first song I heard by them, and probably my least favorite because of how overplayed it is. Still, a powerful introduction for the cd, it gets the thing rolling. 4/5 <br /> <br />2) Bring Me to Life: Another big release that was overplayed. This one annoys me a little less than Going Under, but again, it is a powerful song that helps kick the cd off. 4/5 <br /> <br />3) Everybody's Fool: Another heavy song, I enjoyed this one more than the first two because it wasn't played on the radio. The chorus soars and I've always loved how Amy sings on this song. 5/5 <br /> <br />4) My Immortal: My second most favorite song on the cd. It is much slower and quiter than the first three, but that only allows for Amy's voice to shine all the more. The melody is hauntingly beautiful, and this song will soon become stuck in your head (a very good thing, I assure you!). 10/5 <br /> <br />5) Haunted: Back to the harder stuff, this was my favorite hard song on the cd, simply because of the very eerie intro. Amy's voice crawls over you here, and it really gives me goosebumps. 6/5 <br /> <br />6) Tourniquet: Another excellent hard song, Tourniquetis the one song that I got the impression that Evanescence might be talking about god. Interesting lyrics to this one. 5/5 <br /> <br />7) Imaginary: A song that allows Amy to continue her hauntingly beautiful vocals. While on this cd it is merely another part of the whole, on any other album it would be a stand out song. 5/5 <br /> <br />8) Taking Over Me: A quiet piano intro violently changes into hard guitar riffs and then back again, taking the listner for a few quick ups and downs before flowing into the rest of the song. Another good song. 5/5 <br /> <br />9) Hello: Personally my favorite song on the cd, Hello is another quiet piano song that accents Amy's incredible voice. I am continually shocked by the incredible beauty of this song every time I listen to it. One of my favorite songs ever. 100/5 <br /> <br />10) My Last Breath: Probably my least favorite song on the cd, either because it just feels weaker than the rest or because it follows such an incredible song as Hello. Still pretty good. 4/5 <br /> <br />11) Whisper: A great way to end the cd, although, again, because it follows so soon after Hello it feels weaker. Kinda wish they would have ended the cd with Hello, but anyway. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />All in all, the cd is one of the best that I own (and I own a few hundred), and I would highly suggest anyone who enjoys great and original rock music to listen to this album. Of course, if you want real goth rock, listen to Nightwish, but if you prefer the more trendy American version, then this is for you for sure! My one problem with Evanescence is seeing them live. They have incredible energy (especially Amy), but Amy seems to spend more time on jumping around the stage then actually trying to stay on tune. She's not off badly, but it is occassionally noticable. Still, one of the most incredible live shows I've been to simply because of how hard they rocked to please the crowed.
B000002JKA|5.0|\\"Awake\\" is the dark horse of Dream Theater albums, sandwiched between the brilliant \\"Images and Words\\" and the EP \\"A Change in Seasons\\". It is also the last album with keyboardist Kevin Moore. Its lack of immediate accessibility (coupled with the fact that it starts out somewhat slowly) causes it to be overlooked, which is a shame because this is a dark masterpiece, complete with organs, religious imagery, and a couple of epics. <br /> <br />Track by Track: <br /> <br />1) 6:00  <br /> <br />This track begins the album on a quirky note, with several Dream Theater's signature movie clips. The organs that kick in after the introduction are the first sign that this album is considerably darker than the synthesizer-heavy \\"Images and Words\\". Also, this track is notable for Mike Portnoy's excellent drumming. 7/10 <br /> <br />2) Caught in a Web  <br /> <br />This track is one of the most immediately accessible, although its depth is somewhat lacking in comparison to some of the others on this album. 6/10 <br /> <br />3) Innocence Faded <br /> <br />By far the most uptempo on the album, this track is laden with Dream Theater's signature brilliantly cryptic lyrics, and an extremely catchy bridge. 8/10 <br /> <br />4) Erotomania <br /> <br />A crushing, uber-heavy jam-like instrumental with repeated synthesizers that are haunting as the track's name suggests. This track is the first part of \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\", which is made up of tracks 4-6. 10/10 <br /> <br />5) Voices <br /> <br />This slow, haunting look at the conflict between religion and lust is by far the highlight of the album. James Labrie's vocals are as haunting as ever, and the dark imagery is supplemented by the instrumentation, including an amazing Petrucci solo. Surprisingly, a guest appearance from a rapper is not out of place. 10/10 <br /> <br />6) The Silent Man <br /> <br />Considerably different from Voices is this relaxing acoustic track which borrows some motifs from Erotomania. 8/10 <br /> <br />7)The Mirror <br /> <br />This organ-heavy track deals with alcoholism. It does not stand out much from the track after it. 6/10 <br /> <br />8) Lie <br /> <br />By far Dream Theater's crunchiest song ever, this riffmeister sounds just like The Mirror without an organ. 7/10 <br /> <br />9) Lifting Shadows Off a Dream <br /> <br />This track begins slowly and darkly, and has a very dark (for lack of a better word) bassline that complements the message of desperation. Something seems missing throughout, and sadly, the track switches into a major key halfway through. 8/10 <br /> <br />10) Scarred <br /> <br />The longest track on the album is an multi-layered organ masterpiece with another strong LaBrie vocal performance. This is one of those songs thatI get something new out of every time I listen. 10/10 <br /> <br />11) Space-Dye Vest <br /> <br />Kevin Moore wrote this track just before leaving the band. Not surprisingly, it's mostly piano, with a \\"spacey\\" feel appropriate to the name. For lack of a better word, I would describe this track as \\"ambient\\". The lyrics are beyond bizarre. 6/10
1400032717|4.0|As literature this is good enough, but what really impressed me was the author's uncanny ability to get us inside the main character's head and show us in a very sympathetic way how he experienced the daily activities and interactions which we take for granted but for whichhe required heroic methods in order  to function .  If anything it certainly creates a greater empathy and understanding for people so afflicted.  Also a quick and enjoyable read.

B000683VI4|3.0|Make this a 4-star if you take the time to view the extra features on the DVD.    The lead actors in this movie - Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, Joan Allen, Gena Rowlands, James  Garner - all come through with flying colors, but somehow I still felt that this movie could have had so much more impact.  There were some beautiful scenes with flying geese, and some very touching moments.  James Garner was, in my opinion, the strongest of the leads in his portrayal of a man losing his wife to dementia.  Gena Rowlands as his wife Allie was excellent as well.    Ryan Gosling played Noah naturally and comfortably. I liked the fact that he looked like a regular guy, not just male \\"eye candy\\". Still- and this may be a fault of the novel- all I could think is- if this young man likes to read Walt Whitman with his father, why didn't he have aspirations for college?  Sure he was poor, but why couldn't he break free from his smalltown roots?  His goal of restoring the old riverside mansion was indeed commendable, but why did he need to spend years wallowing in self-pity and drunkenness because his first love had not returned to him?    Rachel McAdams plays Allie, a lively, fun-loving, high-spirited young women on her way to bigger and brighter things, namely college.  College, in her case, however, seemed to be the way that she (and perhaps other women of her time) prepared for being good wives and mothers.    When Ryan goes off to war with his best friend, and loses him to enemy fire, there is no show of emotion.  This is one major downfall of the movie.    I guess that you could sum it all up in this manner - some additional editing and some re-thinking of how the characters react to their dilemmas may have made this film more memorable.  There is a sense that some character development is sketchy at best.    Additional commentary:  Over the course of the week, I had the opportunity to view the movie partially two more times, and I have to say that it grew on me. Rachel McAdamsis just so beautiful, sweet, elegant and charming, and the entire movie is really quite good as compared with other romantic movies out there (are there any right now?)  The additional features of the DVD are excellent, and I highly recommend the DVD over the VHS for the extras.  The casting video of Rachel McAdams when she auditioned for the movie is a wonderful addition, as is the story behind the location - South Carolina.  I loved the editor's short films, and it made me anxious to visit the places depicted in the film.  We hope to see some of them in several months when we travel that way.    I don't know how to change the stars other than to write a new review, so this will have to do for now. This movie is well worth your time, but take the time to view the extras as well.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This is, without question, one of the best albums produced during the 90's.  Not only was this album extremly rare and hard to find prior to \\"Sweet Dreams\\"; Manson was also a very different person at that time.   <br /> <br />When this album came out, nobody knew who Marilyn Manson was.  I live in Chicago and he became somee-what known, because he played a memorable Christmas show here in '95.  That was how I was introduced to the world of Marilyn Manson.  And, this was the album I was given(It was his only at the time) <br /> <br />Damn, this album is raw.....His voice goes from scratchy and rough to melodic and spooky so fluently throughout the entire album.  Tracks like \\"Cake and Sodomy\\" and \\"Wrapped in Plastic\\" are just so much harder and conducive of what Manson was like when he first emerged.  There are glimpses of the \\"Technoey-Manson\\", which emerges in \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" on tunes like \\"My Monkey\\" and to some extent \\"Misery Machine\\", but the techno sound blends in well with the music---much better that Manson would ever accomplish later. <br /> <br />I listen to this album today and I honestly get goosebumps.  It reminds me of something different, something original and something classy....I know the last part must sound odd, but I always felt that Manson was like a classy Frank Sinatra in the sense that Manson always \\"did it my(his) way\\".  If Manson had been receiving play on radio stations in large markets at the time this album came out, he would never have had a musinc career, because this album was just too controversial at the time.  I mean, heavy metal was dead and their lyrics of partying and having sex made way for the sappy, sad, depressing grunge rock that the 90's loved sooooo much..  On this album, Manson is nothing like either heavy metal or grunge rock....he is simply Manson---uncut and free to say whatever he likes. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is an absolute MUST for any Manson fan and a definate work worth studying for any music prospect or historian..
B0000A0DRY|5.0|An absolutely amazing album that you will listen to over and over and over again.  If you do not know this album you are missing out on one of the greatest albums of all time.  Every single song is priceless.  This is one you can just let keep spinning and spinning and it enjoy it the entire time.  I'm nothing short of awed by this album every time I hear it.    The bonus tracks on this version completely ruin the album though.  Buy the original version of the album that ends with \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\".      Over and out  (The Professor recommends: \\"Cheap Thrills\\" by Big Brother & The Holding Company)
B00004T8RK|3.0|Upon the release of this album, this is where Pearl Jam started heading south. \\"Nothing as it Seems\\" was the first radio single, and many faithful Pearl Jam fans were taken back by it. The song was dark, and it was a good indication of the album that it was a part of.<br /><br />Being a huge Pearl Jam fan, and buying all of their albums on the first day of release, I was still excited about this album, but upon listening the first time, I was stunned. Musically speaking, it had its brilliant moments.... but it was dark, and not as easy to listen to as Pearl Jam's other albums. Not only that, this album was really the first one where Eddie Vedder's vocals took a noticable hit. It had been an ever so steady decline from the \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" days, but he just flat out lost his voice on this album.<br /><br />With that said, this album still managed to produce a few very good songs; some of Pearl Jam's finest. \\"Light Years\\" and \\"Thin Air\\" were classics, and \\"Insignificance\\", and \\"Parting Ways\\" were both very good as well. All in all, mediocre album at best, and certainly a misfire for Pearl Jam.

B0006SSOHC|5.0|i go to the movies a lot. I like horror, I like suspense. but i have been disappointed a lot because a lot of stuff that comes out is the same old type of story and very predictable. when i saw this film i couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. never has any kind of film done that to me. this is one of those films that you will either love it or hate it. if you hate it, that's fine just don't say that the people that love it are stupid. this is a good movie. the acting is good. it's not over the top, it's more real, like the way adam talks, he doesn't have all these cool one-liners, he talks like you and me and i appreciated that.
0670033375|3.0|Collapse is so lucidly written that I found myself losing Jared Diamond's train of thought only once or twice. The book  is a brilliant extended argument. It's not meant to solve problems but rather to discuss them.  <br />A confession: I am quite envious of Diamond. He's a tenured professor who knows and can talk to all kinds of rich and important people everywhere.  He goes fly fishing with millionaires. He can explore New Guinea and talk to stone-age people and bird watch at an oil drilling site in Papua.  He gets to visit and stroll around Easter Island and Greenland. He confers with heads of state.  He's a man of the world.  <br />And yet he's modest and only tangentially mentions his personal and professional achievements.  But he's not aw shucks  just plain folks. Men like Diamond are highly privileged and people at home and abroad know and resent it.   <br />For example, if I were Chinese, I would not like to have a person who was free to go where he wanted and do what he pleased telling me I have to restrict my consumption. I'd say, \\"Why don't you not fly to Montana to fly fish? How about staying at home and working to reduce air pollution instead of adding to it?\\" <br />Now this may be America's real problem. We talk the talk but we don't walk the walk. And yet we expect others to listen to us on environmentalism.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is amazing! As a Britney fan I feel this is her best effort yet! It's hot and sexy and filled with great music from beginning to end! I've basically grown up with Britney and as an adult I LOVE the adult Britney. If this is even a hint at what is to come in the future then I'm on the edge of my seat!! Thanks Britney for releasing another 5 STAR CD!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Start to finish a great record.  Aidan Vizidi thinks he knows music by trying to rip on bands, but his career as a critic shall be short lived when the cognoscenti read his drivel.

B0006M4SO6|4.0|The Way Up <br /> <br />It's very difficult, almost unfair to define an opinion on a musical presentation such as this without having the technical knowledge of a musician. The kind of material that the Pat Metheny Group and Pat, by in large has produced, has been so deep and articulately musical that the best I might be able to do is to give it only my superficial opinion as to my personal feel of the music. I cannot speak to the details. One thing that can be said, this current offering named \\"The Way Up\\" is as crisp and clean as have been all the other albums from the Pat Metheny Group. Intense rifts of radical and subtle changes in timing and theme, highs and lows that draw out an individually subjective mental picture; these are the standards of a Pat Metheny Group album that have been benchmarks of this group for years. It's all there, as it has always been throughout the some 30 years of Pat's musical career. The combination of Pat and Lyle is as it has always been on this album, a standard not so standard for those who first come to hear the Group's music. The result, as always, is a magnificent musical production that the Pat Metheny Group offers us to define in our own way. <br /> <br />There is the absolute excellence of one of the greatest base players in the world in terms of technical ability in Steve Rodby. There is the infusion of a percussionist that has added such depth to the group in Antonio Sanchez, and the unique flow of the horn of Cuong Vu (though not as manifest in this album as in his part in \\"Speaking of Now\\"...). And great credit is due to those of Right Track recording studios in New York, with Barry Bongiovi to make such a clean recording.  <br /> <br />To me, listening to any new Pat Metheny Group album, as it was the first time I was privileged to heard of them on the \\"White Album\\" in 1977, has always been like sitting down to read a very good book.  He has had a niche in the \\"jazz\\" world as an artist with a unique heart to take the listener, or may I say \\"reader\\" from highs and lows and definitions that grip you from the start and that do not let go until the very last note of the song, or word of the book. Pat, Lyle and Steve have always taken the listener on a wonderful, sometimes radical journey that only the listener can come to terms with. And like with only the best of books, you want to come back to re-read it time and again. A classic example of what I describe is the song \\"First Circle\\" of the album so named. Their music has a heart, almost a spiritual definition that speaks different things to different people, and which has always been directive and encouraging in a good way. It's always been good music as much as it has been articulate music.  <br /> <br />Pat's music has been like fresh air in a city of stagnant and polluted air. He has been one to break free from the molds of commercialism and materialism. He has stood true to the blessings he and his Group have been given to not only serve the people with a blessing in music but also to make a statement into the \\"jazz\\" world that there is oh so much more to music than the almighty dollar. I have always appreciated Pat for this second purpose. This album, \\"The Way Up\\", stands in stark contrast to the norm. It cuts cleanly away from the standard series of 4.0 minute commercial song tracks and takes the listener on a more complex journey that requires time. TIME.....! Oh if I only had the time to just stop for a while and listen to more than a four-minute song!  <br /> <br />This is not your standard Pat Metheny album though, in terms of definition. Certainly in terms of musical technicality it is, but in terms of definition, it is not. In years past, the Group would write a series of songs, each with great and specific definition, a sort of book with many chapters. In the case of \\"The Way Up\\", this presentation is more like a piece of artwork. It is four subsections that are wrapped up in one whole presentation, one single definition. Though with subchapters, this album is not as it has ever been done before by the Group (besides maybe the flip side of \\"Offramp\\"). <br /> <br />I listened very closely to the \\"The Way Up\\" three times before this writing. It was like standing in front of a painting for hours trying to decide my opinion of it. I'm still not sure what to think! All I can tell you is that this is not your standard Pat Metheny album in that it lacks the kind of immediately discernable definition I have come to recognize from former presentations. It's not the kind of book I'm used to, but a work of art that has to sink in, if you understand my heart here.  <br /> <br />I understand that Pat and the Group have been of the mentality to make a statement against the norm in the music world, and rightly so. He has done it well, albeit through a small core of avid fans. I'm not so sure of the effectiveness of his activism though. I would say that Pat is much better a musician than he is an activist. He, in my humble opinion, is more a book writer than he is a painter.  <br /> <br />This album is a great work of art and outright blows out of the water 99.9% of anything else being produced today. Only I must consider this work in light of the works of Pat's past, not neglecting progression and the future. His has been a natural progression of increasing excellence. Sometimes, in such a long career as this, there is room for question, or more complex interpretation. Or maybe this album just differs from my tastes.  <br /> <br />As other have said in other reviews, the album \\"The Way Up\\" is not your normal Pat Metheny album. If you are a first time listener, go back to the \\"Pat Metheny Group Album\\" of 1977, or to \\"Offramp\\", or to \\"Imaginary Day\\", or to \\"First Circle\\", or to their last release \\"Speaking of Now\\".  Have a listen there, then come back to this album and see what you think. Regardless, it's well worth the listen... if you have the time. I sincerely hope you have the time. <br /> <br />As for me and the rest of the jazz world, we have but a narrow selection to choose from in terms of great cutting edge music such as this. I say, please Pat, Lyle and Steve keep it coming? And thanks for many years of wonderful sounds.  <br /> <br />T. Scott Morton <br />tsgemort@msn.com <br />
015603008X|5.0|The first time I read \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", I needed to find a good book for my 9th grade first quarter book report. When I told my mom that \\"all the good books\\" were taken, she told me to find \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", and she guaranteed that I would love it. And I did. Since then, every person who has ever asked me for a reccomendation of a good book, I always tell them they need to read this book. The story is so beautifully told, and you really feel Charlie's emotions with him as you get into the story. I also love that it's not a book that makes fun of Charlie as a mentally challenged person, but it shows what it might be like to be mentally challenged.<br /><br />Anyone who hasn't read this book needs to. It will change your life.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|\\"Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut\\" takes the audience down the rabbit hole on a long, strange trip that alternately becomes, surreal, comic, dramatic and just plain scary. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) suffers from hallucinations and takes medication to help control his \\"visions\\". One night after taking his medication he has an encounter with a large, rancid, evil looking six foot tall rabbit who informs him that the world is going to end. \\"Frank\\" (as he calls his imaginary friend) takes him briefly into the future disappearing and reappearing throughout the film. Evidently only Donnie can stop it. The film moves from fantasy to reality with no clear indication as to whether or not Donnie's \\"visions\\" are real or if everything is in his imagination. Using a soundtrack made up of 80's staples (\\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" by Joy Division, \\"Head Over Heels\\" by Tears For Fears, \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\" by INXS among many other titles), director/writer Richard Kelly creates a bizarre satire of suburbia and surreal science fiction drama. Kelly's original version of the film featured some different songs and was shorter (and features new sequences and optical effects not in the 2001 release) but also seemed more open to interpretation. The allegorical references sprinkled throughout the film along with the bizarre dream sequences made the original film both fascinating and plain weird.<br /><br />This new director's cut makes the film less opaque and adds an element of the \\"Twilight Zone\\" to Kelly's rich, original vision. The director's cut isn't necessarily a better film just different. Visually stunning and with an outstanding cast, inscrutable script \\"Donnie Darko\\" was just different enough to not score with audiences post-9/11. That's tragic as this totally original film makes an impression whether you're watching the original version or the director's cut of the film.<br /><br /> \\"Donnie Darko\\" lives up to its title with a number of unusually dark images. Fox has done an admirable job translating this film to DVD.  Unfortunately, Director Kelly and DP Hunter went for a muted, gauzy look with soft blacks and muddy image reproduction. There's nothing we can do about and Fox has done the best with what they were given. I did notice occasional analog flaws pop up on the print but aside from that it looks pretty good despite the limitations placed on the film by Kelly and Hunter. I'm surprised that Fox didn't use the extended branching approach here that they did with  the\\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" boxed set but that could be simply because the film has been reshuffled too much to do so. The 5.1 and 2.0 mixes sound solid although the sound is a bit murky towards the conclusion with some distortion on this edition of the film.<br /><br /> Fox wisely put all the extras on disc two of this set allowing the film to benefit from the extra disc space. We get a \\"Donnie Darko Production Diary\\" (with optional commentary by Director of Photography Steven Poster). . There's also a commentary track by Director of Photography Steven Poster in the Donnie Darko Production Diary which provides an interesting insider's perspective and lots of trivia about the production of the film. Featuring camcorder shot footage of the search for locations and behind-the-scenes footage of the production, it's an interesting glimpse into the process of pre-production. #1 Donnie Darko Fan is the result of an internet contest for the best short film about being a fan of this film. The winner's film is included and gives a glimpse into the odd world of fandom. We also get a storyboard to screen comparison for a key sequence from the film. They Made Me Do It features interviews with British fans of the film discussing what drew them to the film and how it changed their view of the world.<br /><br /> A fascinating commentary track by Director Kelly who discusses his film with fellow Director Kevin Smith (\\"Clerks\\"). It's, at turns, informative, philosophical and very involving. Does it answer the big questions about this film? Not exactly but it wasn't designed to do that either.<br /><br />Kelly's original vision has been revised somewhat in this \\"Director's Edition\\" of Donnie Darko. The meaning of Kelly's film is still, ultimately, open to debate and while the film may be a bit less ambiguous than the first theatrical cut, its also got its fair share of great moments as well.  The first disc comes with a terrific commentary track by Kelly and Director Kevin Smith. The second has all the extras including a documentary on the making of the movie, a glimpse at the fandom following this unusual cult film. We also get to see the film that won the contest for #1 Donnie Darko fan. While it's not something to crow about it is an interesting look at what levels the fans of this unusual and great little movie will go to. Be warned fans of the theatrical cut that this version runs longer, has different songs and may spoil some of your pet theories about the film's meaning.is film?

0786890754|5.0|I first came across this book when I saw it highlighted in Cosmo one month. So the next time I was in the library, I snatched it up off the shelf.<br /><br />I love the way this book takes such an honest look into a woman's life. And not just a woman, a YOUNG woman. There are pop culture references in this book that young women can appreciate, as well as true emotions that anyone could relate to. And the story of how Holly goes through her mourning period is just brilliant. I am still wowed that someone so young (only 22!!) wrote such a deep and insightful story about the life of a young widow.<br /><br />I would reccomend this book to just about anyone. And not just women, either, because I really think that men could get something out of it, too.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|If your expecting somthing like \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", your gonna be dissapointed, this movie is more like \\"Seven\\" but the dialogue of script isn't that great, it starts off good but then you find yourself waiting for it to get good which doesn't happen untill the very end. <br />
B000267JQK|5.0|I bought the original Disclaimer a week after it's release in 2002, and I was culture shocked. I firmly believe, and will debate anyone who doesn't conccur with me, that Seether is the best new rock band to emerge within the past few years. Not only is there not a bad song on this disc, most are phenominal. The only albums I have come back to and been amazed as many times as I have this, are by the Beatles or Nirvana. Not to try and make that comparison, but you get my point. Now For disclaimer II the band has actually made a great album better. When I first heard that this was released I was dissapointed because I was looking forward to a new album, not just some b-sides slapped on a classic. However these are more then just b-sides, \\"cigarettes\\" features one of the most addictive guitar riffs and vocal melodies I have ever heard. But I think the biggest gems on this album is the additions of \\"love her\\" and \\"take me away,\\" especially \\"take me away\\". To me these songs show that this and has immense potential, These heart felt psuedo-ballads are both moving and rocking! I can say this, if you haven't bought it yet, shame on you! I would recommened this album to anyone with ears, it's that simple.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|OVERVIEW: Most national newspaper reviews were average at best for \\"Troy\\" (2004). I went into this movie not expecting much - which was probably the best way to go. I had several years of latin & mythology in high school and college and liked the subject matter in general (though I don't claim to be a Greek historian as some writers here seem to be). I knew most of the players here, but I don't think it's essential to know them going in. You quickly know that this movie is depicting a battle between two very distinct sides (Greeks vs Trojans). I think if you enjoy movies and like to be entertained by Hollywood - you'll enjoy \\"Troy\\". However, if you go into this film expecting things to unfold how historian's have documented - you'll be sorely disappointed. This is the Reader's Digest 'condensed' version of a 10 year war - taking place over about 2 weeks. \\"Troy\\" fits in nicely with the other ancient era/period movies like \\"Ben Hur\\", \\"Clash Of The Titans\\", \\"Spartacus\\", \\"Ulysses\\", \\"Hercules\\", \\"The Odyssey\\", \\"Jason & The Argonauts\\", \\"Gladiator\\", and even Marlon Brando's \\"Julius Caesar\\".<br /><br />THE GOOD: Director Wolfgang Peterson (\\"The Perfect Storm\\", \\"Air Force One\\", \\"Das Boot\\", \\"In The Line Of Fire\\") has the reputation for making a good action film. He does not disappoint in making \\"Troy\\". There are some truly great battle scenes featured here; a great fight between the lead characters of the Greek Achilles and the Trojan Hector. There is also some wonderful scenery - the vast many ships out on the Aegean Sea, the huge walls around the city of Troy, the sweeping shots of the armies on the beach as well as outside the great entrance to Troy's city. The male cast is exceptional. Brad Pitt as the ultimate warrior Achilles; Eric Bana as the patriotic Hector; Orlando Bloom perfectly playing wimpy Paris; Peter O'Toole as Troy's King Priam; Brian Cox as the loathsome Greek King Agamemnon; Sean Bean as supportive Odysseus. The story revolves around Paris stealing Menelaus' wife (Helen) and bringing her back to Troy. Menelaus wants her back and decides to go to his brother (Agamemnon) to fight for her. Turns out Agamemnon isn't so much in it for his brother as much as he wants to conquer Troy itself. Enter Paris running away from Menelaus, Hector killing Menelaus, Agamemnon declaring war, lots of fighting, a Trojan Horse, a city on fire, and so on. History books tell us the Trojan War lasted 10 years. \\"Troy\\" appears to last about 2 weeks. While there were some great scenes in \\"Troy\\" - Achilles battling Hector, King Priam sneaking into Achilles tent and asking for his dead son's body back for a proper burial, the hundreds of ships in the Aegean Sea arriving on the Trojan shores, the whole Trojan horse scene - there are several things that prevent me from giving this movie a higher rating.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: Brad Pitt was good, but not great. Some of his lines were just not convincing. His choreographed fight scenes seemed somewhat labored. His death scene was uneventful. His pecks and abs looked fine (as my wife would agree). Pitt was no Russell Crowe (in \\"Gladiator\\"), or Mel Gibson (in \\"Braveheart\\")... not even close. I like Pitt, and loved his lunacy in \\"Fight Club\\", \\"12 Monkeys\\" and \\"Seven\\" - perhaps \\"Troy\\" was too 'calm' for him. Most of the females in this movie were disappointing. The main female was Helen (Diane Kruger). A somewhat limp and feeble woman - I was expecting a stronger character role here - one that wasn't so love-struck or sobbing so dang much. As good as Brian Cox was as Agamemnon, I felt he was too short for this movie. Anything I've ever read in mythology said Agamemnon was monsterous in size. I recognized several 2nd and 3rd tier actors in \\"Troy\\" that had played supporting roles in the similar era/period type movies \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Gladiator\\". The soundtrack was also very reminiscent of \\"Gladiator\\". The 2-disc DVD set was overkill. I guess with 2 discs, I somehow expect a boat-load of extras. Not sohere - the six DVD extras here total about 50 minutes. Included is the trailer, a language choice selection, \\"Gallery Of the Gods\\" (giving a brief history lesson on 12 Greek Gods - from Apollo to Zeus), a battle and a historical perspective, and a special effects odyssey (rubber swords et all). While the DVD extras were good and gave a keen look inside the making of the film, they were by no mean extensive. All of this could have easily fit on one disc. At 162 minutes, prepare for a good sit with plenty of popcorn and a Coke. \\"Troy\\" falls into the ranks of the mega-blockbusters with its $200+ million budget. It did well at the box office for several weeks, but then fell way short of it's projected in take ($)... thus, in my prediction, dooming it come Oscar time (3.5 stars).DVD extras here total about 50 minutes.

B00000K19E|5.0|They should of just done this one cause it is the best and one of thegreatest movies of all time, if you don't know it stars Keanu Reeves as Neo or Thomas Anderson, carrie ann moss as Trinity, Hugo weaving as Agent Smith, and Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus who is like a spiritual leader or some sh-T. This movie has great fight scenes like the one in the lobby with all the guns n sh-t. The whole movie is great and I'm glad when Mouse and them others die cause they are annoying.<br /><br />the action is fantstatic and the whole movie is great. watch for a good movie
B0000029GA|5.0|Every single has it's own defined style and each single is enjoyable.There are similarities to tracks on the Iam album in particular 'We will survive' with 'One Love' on this album.  <br />A must for any Nas o hiphop fan.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I am a movie goer. I love movies. I pride myself on knowing a good movie when I see it.  To this end, I have no idea what makes this movie so well loved. I hated it. It was painful. I loved CLOSER, SIDEWAYS, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, GARDEN STATE!!!  This one I could live without.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This would be a good purchase for people who either A: have Chronicle and want to hear more, B: have their songs on tape, C: younger fans who enjoy classic rock music, D: People who might have one of their CDs, but haven't gotten around to picking up the remastered copy.  <br /> <br />I still recommend \\"Chronicle\\" vol. 1 and 2 but nothing truly beats this collection.  <br /> <br />CCR have had their songs repackaged time and time again, and this is the first time their work has been properly put together.  <br /> <br />First off, you get a full length CD of the pre-CCR Golliwogs and Blue Velvets, which showcases the Fogerty brothers trying to find their own style and trying others. Starting with \\"Little Tina\\" and \\"Walk on the Water\\" (which they'd rerecord as CCR) you start hearing the style they'd run with. On the second CD, you hear them start off with the rare 45 \\"Call it Pretending\\" into more familiar terrotory. The second through the fifth CDs cover all their studio recordings and some promos here and there. Part of the fifth and all of the sixth CD showcase CCR in a live setting (some of which are repeated), and even though the audio is not as good as it should be, it's still pretty energetic and sounds almost as good as the studio albums. The closest we can get is John Fogerty's \\"Premonition\\" DVD which covers a healthy amount of CCR-era material.  <br /> <br />Finally, this would have been a good time to put out a video collection exclusive to the box set (a lot of which people have rarely if ever seen). On American Bandstand, they did \\"Commotion\\" and \\"Green River\\", on Ed Sullivan they did \\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"Down on the Corner\\", on Johnny Cash they did \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" and \\"Proud Mary\\", Beat Club in Germany, and had full length shows filmed at the Royal Albert Hall and in Oakland Arena in 1970 for TV as well as Roundhouse in the UK in 1968, promo videos for \\"Bootleg\\", \\"Looking Out My Back Door\\", \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\" and \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\" aswell as possible Woodstock footage. Overall it would've made for a decent 2 hour collection of video footage.  <br />

B0001ENY6M|5.0|The Passion of the Christ is an epic film and as such, it needed an epic score.  John Debney provides one.  At some points, Debney's music is extremely moving and the addition of choral music serves to give evil, as it is represented in the film, an unnerving quality.  However, my favorite tracks in this cd span from the quite, personal moments, \\"Mary Goes to Jesus\\" to the expansive \\"Crucifixtion\\" as well as the moments in the film that flash between past and present.  I admit, however, that my favorite track on the cd is the final one.  While, I admit I was not overly moved by Gibson torture of Christ (I have seen better, more impactful films: Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazerath for one), his finale left a deep impact, especially with the music.  THe end of film has a scene of Satan laughing, then a moment of absolute horror on Satan's face as it realizes that it just lost, then Gibson switches to a scene of the Resurrection with the grave clothes collapsing inward and a Resurrected Christ rising up.  The music as this point in the film is triumphant and epic and totally enjoyable.  The whole point of the Crucifixtion is the Resurrection and while that message may get lost in the film, Debney does not lose it in the score.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is the best CD that SOAD has ever released. Some people don't like this album, but they DO NOT no what great music is! I recommend this album to any rock fan.

B0006SSOHC|5.0|It's hard to know where to start with this movie. It's just so good. I guess it would be good to start off by saying that this movie is more than just props and imagery. It's very, very plot driven, with a story that will have you on the edge of you seat, screaming at the screen and droping your jaw at the ending. It's twist after turn, shock after scare. Not your typical horror, not your typical slasher. This movie is realy very psychological, and I think any one who likes a good mystery will get a kick out of it.<br /><br />But, any review of this movie wouldn't be a real review if it DIDN'T talk about the visuals. So many cool prop ideas are in the movie, from the puppet (who the creaters named 'Bill') to the pig mask to all the chilling murder scenes. This is where the movie gives horror fans what they really want. Also, Saw is not uptight when it comes to the blood, but not so much to just be 'slasher'. The blood doesn't drown out the story.<br /><br />I will have to admit, the acting by Cary Elwes is wretched, and he's the main character really, so that does hurt the film. Still, even his 'drama club' quality acting can't kill the blood chilling story.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, the bonuses leave a lot to be desired. No cut scenes and the 'making of' is pitiful. You learn more by listening to the commentary than by watching 'Sawed Off'. Saw is the type of movie that 'making of's were made for, and they really droped that ball there. Perhaps they're holding out for a collectors edition or some thing. I'd be pretty let down if that was the case.<br /><br />Lastly I have to mention the ending. Seriously...it's all about the ending. Well...not ALL about the ending, but...I was blown away. Just go see it. You wont be sorry.
0385513755|5.0|I received this beautiful book as a gift and it is a grand complement to the paperback version. With the Special Illustrated Edition on your lap you no longer need to look up all the magnificent works of art and Renaissance architecture since all the necessary information for any Holy Grail quest is suddenly in front of you. This splendid publication makes it far easier to follow all the hidden clues in The Da Vinci Code, while at the sametime it further helps to bring Dan Brown's wonderful story to life. Not that The Da Vinci Code needs pictures to make it readable! I first read this contoversial story shortly after it was published and it still remains in my top 5 favourite books of all time. It could also prove to be one of the greatest mystery books ever written.<br /><br />So why all the controversy about a fictional plot with equally fictional characters? For those persons living in Outer Mongolia and County Kerry who haven't yet heard about The Da Vinci Code, the book contains historical information about a secret brotherhood and hidden clues in world famous works of art that communicate knowledge about the survival of the Royal bloodline - The Holy Grail. This knowledge, if true, subsequently challenges the Vatican's perceived origins of its faith and therefore draws into question the legitimatacy of the Catholic Church in modern times; Martin Luther where art thou?<br /><br />Fact or fiction in relation to the book's historical content, The Da Vinci Code's Special Illustrated Edition further opens up your mind to concepts and ideas which the Vatican considers to be heresy. And having been educated at a single sex Catholic School, I am fully aware of all forms of heresy! However, for Dan Brown fans and Holy Grail enthusiasts alike who prefere to 'Love Thy Neigbour As Thy Self', this edition is a must have if you want to study and research all the art clues and then draw your own conclusions about the survival of Christ's bloodline.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|I have to start out by saying that I was not a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, I had read &quot;A walk to remember&quot;, and had seen the film version of it, as well as the film &quot;message in a bottle&quot;...I wasn't taken by either of them...they fell short in my books. So when I saw this DVD in the video store, I picked it up because frankly there was nothing else to get...but I am so glad that I did. <br />I have often said that if a movie can make me cry...it will be a favorite of mine for ALL time! This story is so sweet and heartwarming.  Beyond the story, I think that the actors did an amazing job of portraying the characters. I fell in love with Noah Calhoun along side Allie...I even said to my husband half way through, &quot;I really like that guy...he's really cool!!&quot; There is just something about him, that drew me in. (Ryan Gosling)<br />I love that throughout the story you never really know whether the man reading Allie the story is Noah, or Lon...they leave you guessing until the end (I won't give away the secret!!) But after the movie my husband and I were saying that either way...it would have been alright. <br />It is a MUST see in my books...the actors are amazing, and the story is amazing!! I felt emotionally drained after watching it!! There is nothing like a good cry...especially when it is not something in your own life that you are crying about!!<br />I LOVED IT!!<BR>5 stars!!
B00020HEL6|5.0|Damn! This is Renee's 3rd album... her first two having been produced at age ten, four years have now passed before delivering this remarkable work.  I've never been much of a fan of jazz singers of any stripe.  I have damned near wept listening to this.  It's not that Olstead is clearly astounding as a premere jazz singer, for she is merely quite impressive, but knowing that she was all of 14 when this was recorded does propel the experience of the listener to great heights. <br /> <br />This is not to say that Olstead needs caveats of any sort, this is a lovely work by any standard, but to see how far she has come in four years, with another six before she exits her teens, this performer has a shot at greatness.  This added touch, for me, makes this album wonderfully inspirational, even astounding.  She's having fun... and you can feel it. <br /> <br />Part of what made Shirley Temple so wonderful was not that her acting represented the pinnacle of the actors art, but of her uniqueness with respect to her peers.  Temple also provides an example of how short stardom can last...  and yet... <br /> <br />I don't see Olstead as a \\"child sensation\\".  Your ear will accept her as very talented woman.  Clearly, she is emulating a broad range of styles masterfully, proving her perceptive ear, and her voice delivers in kind. <br /> <br />Only time will tell if she can deliver a truly unique style to her work, but clearly, she has talent to spare. <br /> <br />You will love this album.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|My verdict: <br />1. Jacqueline - Pretty good, not my best, starts off slow then goes into a fast paced song. Slowish rock 7/10 <br />2. Tell her tonight - This one, although the lyrics are basic, this song cracks me up. Funny tune and weird voice 8/10 <br />3. Take me out - Ah, the well known single. Very good bass and powerful beat, only it needs more lyrics 9/10 <br />4. Matinee - I love the music to this, although his voice is a bit old fashion here. When he is singing \\"Find me and follow...find me in the matinee\\" his voice connects well with the beat in almost a hypnotising way 8/10 <br />5. Auf Acshe - Not my favourites, because it's a bit slow, but I like the slow music 7/10 <br />6. Cheating on you - Quite fast and rocky, slightly too old-fashioned, they sound a bit drunk 7/10 <br />7. This fire - This song has pretty cool music, fresh and rocky, but a freakish deranged chorus 8/10 <br />8. Darts of pleasure - I like the music to this, almost a seductive song, but to a fast beat 8/10 <br />9. Michael - THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG!!!!!!!! IT'S SOOO GOOD!! When I first heard this song I thought \\"hmm...cool music\\" but when I listened to the words I thought \\"is he singing in a girls perspective?\\" but then I heard the \\"This is who I am, I am a man so come and dance with me Michael\\" I instantly got scared. The lyrics are HILARIOUS about a gay man, in love with a sticky-haired and sticky-lipped man called Michael who's a dance-whore on the dance floor, to sum up. Got the sexiest music! 11/10 <br />10. Come on home - this song kinda annoys me, the lyrics aren't original, and so does the music, like they are trying to copy someone else 5/10 <br />11. 40 ft - My second favourite song!! The music is AMAZING in the sense that it creepy, with the bass and guitars sounding so good together, and his voice is so spooky 10/10 <br />Overall, buy this album. You may not like it at first (like me) but soon it should grow on you <br />
0765309408|5.0|I found this book an excellent read. Anyone who likes \\"hard\\" sci-fi + military theme will find this book satisfying. <br /> <br />I can only hope that another one will be published soon as the ending is rather open-ended.  <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I have waited close to twenty years for this recording.  To say the wait was worth it is an understatement.  It starts with Status Quo, who appropraitely kick of the proceedings with Rockin All Over The World, the perforect song for such an occasion.  The Wembley line up and crowd are miles better than Philli show, which seem subdued by comparison.  The highlights are U2, Claption, Bowie (who was just so cool), but the best set of the day by miles is when Queen strut on stage and proceed to takeover the event.  There 20 minute set is possible the greatest live performance by any band period.  The way Freddie Mercury commands the stage and the audience is a sight to behold.  I feel sorry for the guys who had to come on after that peformance, as there was no way it could be topped.  Other memorable moments include Dire Straits and Money for Nothing wth Sting, Elton John and The Who set.  The DVD is worth every penny, so go out and buy some history, which is unlikely to be repeated on this scale.
B000003CMD|5.0|for me \\"ramblin man\\" was the 1st taste i got of the allman brothers and i've been a fan ever since...i've heard people say that \\"ramblin\\" is a tired radio fave and \\"jessica\\" is the standout and it is,but when i heard the harmony guitars at the end i was an allman fan for life...
0671027387|4.0|A NASA satellite discovers an unknown object buried deep in the Arctic ice and announces that it has found evidence of alien life form. NASA needs this in order to keep the huge money coming to it from the government. As the President sends in his team of specialists to verify the find, the real truth about what is going on comes out. Lots of action, thrills and conspiracies. One of Brown's best books.
B0002S947K|5.0|First things first... this is a standout album. I'm not enamored with the batch of singer/songwriters the music press had made noise about in the past few years and one of the sore spots for me is the singing. They all seem to have that same fey, whispery voice and it gets old very fast. Somehow somebody got the idea that singing like you're half asleep sounds more intimate. It doesn't. It just makes you sound less awake. Finally here's a guy, Ray LaMontagne, who can belt it out and put some feeling into it! I love the voice and love the songs. The production has just enough elements in it to keep the music interesting, without being either too sparse or too busy (or too \\"radio-friendly\\"). It just fits. Great job with the recording. His influences are evident but he never sounds like he's trying to imitate anyone.  <br />Which brings me to my second point... The Van Morrison comparisons are waaaaaaayyyyyy overstated! It's completely absurd that Van's name comes up in nearly every review here. I'm a big Van Morrison fan (and now a big Ray LaMontagne fan) and I just don't hear it except in an occasional snippet of something in a musical passage. Vocally, they have nothing in common whatsoever. Everyone hears something different in a piece of music but it's beyond me how so many people hear Van Morrison when there are so many others from the same era you might cite (Cat Stevens, The Band, James Taylor, Gordon Lightfoot, etc.) if you must make these kinds of comparisons. The problem is, he doesn't really sound like any of those people, either. I say all this because I would hate for anyone who reads these reviews to assume they know what this album is all about and either dismiss it or go into it with unrealistic expectations. Forget all that and give a listen to one of the best albums by a new solo artist to come along in a good, long time. By the way, I just read a magazine piece on Ray LaMontagne and he hates the Van Morrison comparisons. He says he'd never even heard a Van Morrison record before he put this album together!
B0002858YS|4.0|It was about 8 months ago.  I walked into an electronics store and saw this album on sale for $6.99.  After hearing how amazing they were, I bought it.  It was indie.  It was 80's.  It was dance.  It didn't get much airtime.  Now, things are different; the album grew on me, they recieved a grammy nod, and they appear to be usurping the U2 torch - that's \\"all anthems, all the time.\\" <br /> <br />The truth about the music industry is it's floundering.  Nothing huge has been released lately.  If you sell a million records, you're probably one of the biggies.  If you have a fan base, you're probably not a new band.  If you sell out a show, you're probably Metallica.  Point is, the albums that are selling are new albums from old artists, and old albums in new form from deceased artists.  If you are new, you have to fit into a certain hybrid genre; punk-pop, garage-rock, garage-blues, indie-pop, etc etc.  It's just not a good day for the new bands. <br /> <br />That's why I love the Killer's \\"Hot Fuss.\\"  Yes they fit fairly well into a category and they have to play some of the games, but they got soul.  \\"Mr. Brightside\\" was possibly second to only F. Ferdinand's \\"Take Me Out\\" as single of 2004.  \\"Hot Fuss\\" rated somewhere in the top ten albums of '04 in most major music magazines and websites.  \\"All The Things I've Done\\" will serve as the template for future indie-80's dance bands.  The Grammy nomination was just the icing on the cake.  Now the big question: can they do it again? <br /> <br />Overall: 8 out of 10.
0060763280|5.0|I've been learning from Harv Eker for only three years, and this is my year to become a millionaire. I ordered 50 books, which have not yet arrived, but I think the \\"put your money where your mouth is\\" endorsement is the best kind, don't you?<br /><br />(And that's what T. Harv Eker does--bases his training on results not theory. That's how I know this is the new book everyone will be talking about. Be the first on your block, not the last to know!)
B0000C8AVI|3.0|Bob Dylan went from acoustic to electric, from electric to country, from country to Christianity. Just when the fans had gotten used to the constantly transformed Dylan, and perhaps appreciated him too, he turned away and did what he had to do, maybe in desperate attempts to escape the myth of himself or maybe just through instinct.<br /><br />SLOW TRAIN COMING, the first of three Christian albums, then naturally made a lot of people feel betrayed.<br /><br />Well. Who knows what he was thinking. Some of the lyrics are indeed over-the-top in a senseless, almost scary manner, and just the idea of the song DO RIGHT TO ME BABY (with almost humorous lines like \\"Don't wanna judge nobody\\") is a walking contridiction.<br /><br />Still, it is not an \\"angry\\" album. It has been made in good will and comes off in a good hearted spirit. You feel just as good as you do bad while listening to this, and if you manage to shut off, or ignore some of the lyrics and ideas, you'll find that SLOW TRAIN COMING has some of Dylan's best efforts in making memorable melodies.<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm not that sensetive regarding the lyrics. I think everybody can agree that Dylan, even for Dylan, was in a strange period of his career. The man who once sang \\"Don't follow leaders\\", on his knees and violently convinced. Still, his confidence is powerful enough to make me see this as fair enough album. I simply buy it, it doesn't feel fake (it never does when it comes to Dylan).<br /><br />And GOTTA SERVE SOMEBODY, PRECIOUS ANGEL, I BELIEVE IN YOU and WHEN HE RETURNS are some of his most memorable post-60's songs, wheter you take them out of their context or not.
B00013AXEE|5.0|I've never been fond of Stephen King's works.<br /><br />That's not to say I don't have tremendous respect for the man.  Heck, I'm green with envy over his success.  I'm not quite as envious over his scriptwriting career, but that's still more produced scripts than I have (0). There are exactly two stories I've read that I actually enjoyed: the short story \\"The Cat from Hell\\" and the novel \\"The Eyes of the Dragon.\\" A lot of people have read \\"The Eyes of the Dragon,\\" so I won't dwell on it other than to say that it's a fantasy novel and not a bad one at that.<br /><br />Virtually no one has heard of \\"The Cat from Hell,\\" which I stumbled across as a child looking for short stories about fantastic characters.  Boy did I get one, a terrifying tale of an assassin hired to execute a cute little kitty that turns out to be far more dangerous than anyone could ever imagine.  I don't think Mr. King doesn't like cats.<br /><br />Anyway, what I've since read from King since often seemed like it meandered.  Where \\"The Cat from Hell\\" was a tight, gripping story, there has since been a lot of farting, nose picking, and other silliness interspersed through King's novels that turn me off.  It's like a kid making farting sounds with his armpit during a scary movie...hard to be scared when someone's giggling behind you.<br /><br />On Writing explains King's approach and more.  It also sums up a lot of King's life, a life that would make exceptionally fertile material for his later horror movies.  Most significantly, the book is refreshingly honest.  King doesn't think his works are masterpieces, but he does believe he is an artist and a successful one.  He talks about it like it is, explaining what it takes to be a writer and more significantly, what will make you a GOOD writer.  King has little respect for writing classes. In fact, one could argue On Writing is the first and last book anyone needs about writing.<br /><br />For King, the most important aspect of writing is telling the truth: about oneself, about what you know, about whom you know, and how you know it.  His clear-minded approach cuts through the usual claptrap about high art, English teacher sophisms, and notions about what it means to be a \\"success.\\"  King really gives it his all, baring his heart and soul and admitting to some very nasty things in his life that nearly ended his career.<br /><br />Then King was hit by a van.<br /><br />That last chapter is riveting, not the least of which is because it is as if the book's wisdom is put to the test.  King, in detail that only he can describe, explains just what happened.  And it all seems a lot like his novels, a real life horror story.<br /><br />The highest compliment I can give this book is that it sent me straight back to my writing, the \\"closed door\\" kind, the kind written for the Ideal Reader, the kind that is what I know not what I think I should know.<br /><br />King inspires prospective authors to write the Truth.  And that's more valuable than all his other books put together.telling the truth: about oneself, about what you know, about whom you know, and how you know it.

0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere is a dark fantasy at its highest level. Richard Mayhew ceases to exist in the London that we know and finds himself in the dark, dangerous, magical London Below.  Here, he finds creatures and people and places and begins a quest which will lead him to face dangers everywhere. An adult, dark fantasy which reads from page to page at superb speed. A great work from Neil Gaiman
B000050X31|3.0|For the person that cannot handle Battle, a black woman, as Pamina, I would like to state that opera is fantasy.  People do not break out in spontaneous song at the drop of a hat.  Therefore, it is easy to allow Battle to play the part of a character that was originally written for someone who is white.  I don't think Mozart would object.  What is important is her singing.  Go back to Nature Shows if you can't deal with it.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Two words come to mind after watching this movie: HOLY CRAP!!! I love scary movie and psychotic thrillers; however, most of them don't even scare me at all anymore. Saw is so creepy and realistic that it had me wondering how long before a copy cat killer emerges. The premise of the movie is two guys are chained to pipes in a bathroom, and they are trying to reconstruct the steps to how they got there. In the midst of this reconstruction, they discuss the killer who sets up scenarios like the one they are in where the victims kill themselves. Anyway, enough of the plot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who truly loves a good psycho thriller; however, put the kids away. There is a goofy clown in this movie too....Oh no no IT. I would give this movie about 4.5 out of 5 stars, and it is well worth the rental fee.
0767903862|5.0|I approached this book with a fair bit of skepticism because, lets face it, how interesting can a 350 page book about a scarcely known land be?  To be perfectly fair though, I must say that I was surprisingly bowled over.  Bill Bryson is a brilliant author who was able to inject much life and wit into, what could have quite easily been a phenomenally boring and dry piece.  In addition, I would highly suggest the CD versions of Bryson's books to absorb the full effect of his comedic prowess.  In short, I couldn't have been happier with this book and that's all I've got to say about that.  Read the book and you'll soon understand that last sentence!
0060730552|5.0|I highly recommend this astonishing tale of survival and the nature and strength of the human spirit.  I disagree with those reviewers that felt the book was too technical and of interest primiarily to sportsman and mountaineers.  I am a middle-aged, working mother of three, and rank this book among my favorites of recent memory.  I do consider myself to be moderately well-read, and was expecting clumsy writing and poor technique, knowing that this was the author's first book.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised.  The truth is, after the second or third chapter, I was so gripped by the story that the writing flowed and flowed and flowed.  I found that I could not stop reading.  When I finally reached the point in the book where Joe is rescued, my own head was pounding and I actually felt thirsty, dehydrated, and exhausted. That is a testimony to the power of his writing.  A number of years ago I read Jon Krakauer's book of the Everest disaster,Into Thin Air, as well as Anatoli Boukreev's companion book, The Climb.  While both of these (especially Krakauer's book) were excellent reads, they pale in comparison to Touching the Void.  This is a must read - for those who crave adventure, as well as those who don't.
B0002OERI0|4.0|As a fan of Green Day since 1993, I hear the word sell-out WAY too much!! You so called punks are wrong and you need to grow up! Just because they are no longer 20 yrs. old or because they sell alot of records or that they won a Grammy this year, Is not a sell-out. This record is the American version of The Who's Quadrophenia. It is the story of being a angry and confussed young person in this country right now. Not 1973 or 1993 but right now! It might not be YOUR story or mine at the moment, but we all know there are people that feel these things. Problems with love, drugs, broken homes, the goverment, Idol worship, the media, It's all there. I can tell from listening to this record Green Day have always been into the concept album thing. Which I'am happy to see and hear again. I have not heard a good one since Operation Mindcrime or The Wall. Billy Jo Armstrong has had the Jesus Christ Superstar album logo tattoo for years now! What does that tell you? Also, There are many ties to The Who's Quadrophenia....Big time! But I don't feel they are ripping anyone off 100% idea wise. The only reason I don't give this record 5 stars is because as a concept album it is not as clear in the story-telling as other records like a Quadrophenia or The Wall. It is alittle more hazy in what the full story is. I feel this band could have pulled that off better, But I still think it is valid. I also believe, Years from now... A young person will listen to this and feel that this is something they can relate to on a deep level. The American Idiot record will age with time more than we realize today. I agree with the other reviewers about the song American Idiot as the stand out single is wrong. Don't base your interest in this record on this track. It's good but there are better songs on this. Jesus of Suburbia (The 2nd.track) which connects into City Of The Dammed and I Don't Care are such a great listen and the best part of the record to me. Being in your 30's and still be punk is cool, Not a sellout at all.
0385504217|4.0|Everyone knows or heard about this book. It is a good history thriller, although there are far better ones out there.  Dan Brown has created an action-packed thriller with so much rich history and mystery that everyone who's into such things will like it alot. There are far-fetched scenes, but that's Brown's style. A book to be enjoyed.
0060763280|5.0|I think two kinds of people should get this book and STUDY it cover to cover: MEN and WOMEN!!  If you are serious about getting out of whatever financial rut you are currently in and literally redesigning your own path to wealth, Harv will walk you through every step of the way in this book.<br /><br />Harv tells us we all have a financial \\"set point\\" - kind of like a thermostat in a room - that keeps us stuck at a certain income level.  If we ever earn more than that set point, often we will SABOTAGE our efforts to bring the income level back down!!  Yikes!  Or, we'll find that no matter how hard we push ourselves, we just cannot seem to earn more money.  Harv calls this our \\"financial blueprint\\" or \\"MONEY BLUEPRINT\\".<br /><br />A builder would not build a house without a BLUEPRINT, right?  Well, we are literally creating our wealth (or lack of it!!) by our internal blueprint.  The tricky part is that most of us are not aware of what our money blueprint looks like.<br /><br />So, in this book, Harv shows us how to (a) IDENTIFY exactly what our money blueprint is (usually programmed deeply into our minds by our parents - ugh!) and (b) CHANGE our money blueprint to create a truly successful life -- a life of outrageous prosperity!<br /><br />It stands to reason if your parents only ever earned, say, a max of $100,000 in a year in their lifetime... and our parents are our biggest influencers... how on earth are you going to become a multi-millionaire?  Or even a MILLIONAIRE?!<br /><br />I believe anyone who reads this book and APPLIES the principles will experience a MASSIVE shift in their net worth.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is the best ever, you people who are saying its bad probably only watched it once. And I bet while you were watching it, you were trying to figure out the plot, so you didnt think it was that good. Well, I've got some news for you. There really isnt a plot, its just a bunch of one-liners. And its always better the second time you watch it. So the truth is, Napoleon Dynamite is a great movie, and i reccomend it to everyone, It is totally worth watching!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I am a little torn on the \\"Donnie Darko Director's Cut\\".  The differences from the Theatrical Cut in presentation are subtle, and the differences in character are grand. <br /> <br />I really enjoy the Theatrical Cut.  I think it leaves so much to the imagination that the impact of the film is felt greater.  At the San Diego Comic Con, Richard Kelly told the audience how the Director's Cut came about.  \\"Donnie Darko\\" never got it's fair shake when it was first released.  This was probably due to the film being released soon after 9-11, when people (quite understandably) were not in the mood to see a dark movie about plane parts falling from the sky and the end of a world. <br /> <br />When the film did surprisingly well on home DVD release, the studio allowed Kelly to add in a few things that he had always wanted to, in order to give them an excuse to release the movie theatrically again and give it another chance.  This was very good on the studio's part (unfortunately, they didn't market it very well on it's second release).  Anyway, now we have this new version. <br /> <br />I was set off by the new opening.  Don't worry, there are no big spoilers here.  The only difference in the new opening is the music.  Richard Kelly said that the opening was designed to go with \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\" by INXS, and I can see that; but it works SO WELL with Echo and the Bunnymen's \\"Killing Moon\\".  Now that INXS would finally sell them the rights for the new release, I can see why they used it.  It still seems odd, though, since I'm used to (and prefer) the other song. <br /> <br />After that initial startling change, I settled into this new version of the movie.  I did enjoy the further interaction between the members of Donnie's family.  I think that added a lot to the film.  I'm on the fence about the additions with the explanations of the book and time travel.  I think, sometimes, not knowing details can be better.  Sometimes the audience's imagination can be much more impressive than the film maker's.  Not completely understanding the Theatrical Cut when I first watched it is one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed about it. <br /> <br />I'd write more, but I don't want to give the film away for those who haven't seen it.  Even though they are 90% the same, these two films feel like very different movies.  It's one of those rare films where I'm going to own both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut.  I've done this with The Exorcist, Legend, Brazil, Army of Darkness, and maybe a few other movies where both versions have left me with very distinct feelings, and different things to think about.  If you have never seen \\"Donnie Darko\\", I think you might want to start with the Theatrical Cut.  After that, if you are confused or simply want more of this great movie, then watch the Director's Cut.
0385504209|5.0|A fascinating murder mystery where the victim has left important clues to those who remain alive. Only Robert Langdon, an expert on the Holy Grail, can help solve the multiple riddles of curator Jacques Sauniere. The reader will be captivated by the suspense and intrigue of this story. It is hard to put the book down until you come to the end. Overall, it was a brilliant book and I enjoyed the twists and turns of the story line, but felt that the book's theme was sacrilegious.

0515127485|5.0|In this outstanding work from Robert Harris (his best book after Fatherland) Fluke Kelso is a middle-aged scholar of Soviet Communism, who specializes in the dark history os Stalin. He seeks the rumored notebook that Stalin kept in his final years of life. He meets a former NKVD guard who claims that he was at Stalin's deathbed and that the notebook is real and exists. Before he can get more details, the guard disappears and Kelso finds himself on  a search to find this notebook, which contains some of history's most darkest secrets. Thus he finds himself chased by those who do not want the notebook and its secrets to be ever found. Superb.
0679746048|3.0|This book was well written and kept your interest throughout. However, it has been compared to the Bell Jar, which is unfair. This Bell Jar is more about a descent into madness, which this book deals with far less, and is the poorer for it. However, one of the central themes of this book is whether or not the author was in fact as ill as the authorities claim, so perhaps she had to concentrate on the ward and its inhabitants. The characters were depicted well and so were the relationships with various doctors and psychiatrists. This book is worth reading, but read the Bell Jar first.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I just reviewed How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (not a very good album at all) and felt the need to review a few of their older albums.  Especially Pop, an incredibly under-rated album that I listen to all the time.  I think ATYCLB and HTDAAB are just backlash from the criticism of Pop.  But as of this point, Pop is the last truely great U2 album.  Pop is filled with extraordinary powerful, interesting, emotion-evoking songs, as most U2 albums up to this point were.  Pop focuses on strong, exciting, somewhat experimental songs with quite a bit of a heavy synth/keyboard/processed-guitar type sound to them. <br /> <br />The highlight of the album is \\"Gone\\" (and DO NOT mistake the revised (read: damaged) version on the \\"Best Of\\" album with this true version).  Gone builds to extreme musical/emotional heights with a huge wonderful heavily-processed sound, strong bass, and passionate vocals, starting out with one of U2's best 90's-era hooks I've ever heard.  Other especially great tracks are Do You Feel Loved, Staring At The Sun, Last Night On Earth, and Wake Up Dead Man.  All tremendously interesting with a bit of that experimental sound to them and interesting, emotional vocals.  Not to say the rest aren't great, too.  Even the weakest ones, Miami and Playboy Mansion, are miles above the recent U2 albums.  A few songs like If God Will Send His Angels and Please, took a while to grow on me, but now I like them very much. <br /> <br />U2 claimed that they didn't have enough time to work on this album and criticised it themselves, and perhaps there's a few tracks (like \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\") that sounds like they are mixed a little bit wrong (that one in particular is quiet and hard to make out for the first minute or so), but came across wonderfully in concert.  But I would MUCH rather have a fantastic set of songs that are a little rough here and there than the boring over-processed stuff on HTDAAB.  I wish U2 would ignore sales/critical response and such things and just listen to their true, long-time fans. <br /> <br />My conclusion is this: Pop is a fantastic album.  The concert, which I had the extreme pleasure of seeing twice (once near the beginning and once near the end), was also fantastic.  I don't think Pop is quite as good an album as Joshua Tree or Zooropa, but it comes close.  ATYCLB and HTDAAB are far inferior to this album.  I hate to be blunt because I love U2, but ... don't waste your money on those.  Get this one or earlier instead.  If you have all those, buy up singles with their various wonderful b-sides/soundtrack/cover/etc songs (Everlasting Love, Luminous Times, Room At The Heartbreak Hotel, Night and Day, Lady With The Spinning Head, Satelite of Love, Alex Decends ..., Deep In The Heart, Holy Joe, Happiness is a Warm Gun, and way too many more to list them all ... far more than just on the b-side CDs).  Or get the Popmart or Zoo TV VHS's (not on DVD yet, not suprisingly, *sigh*). <br />
140004281X|3.0|Alice Munro is unsurpassed as a wordsmith.  Her language is precise, her storytelling exacting, her style lyrical.  I consider her among the ranks of Annie Proulx and Arundhati Roy as a great contemporary female talent.    But her Runaway stories are so small and quiet that I find myself struggling to concentrate.  They are beautifully told tales, but none too engaging.    And I cannot help but notice the seeming gender gap between ratings on this site.    I give her a 5 for style, but believe me, this record you can't dance to.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I don't know exactly why I enjoy watching this movie so much, I've already seen it about 6 times and still want to see it over again. I guess it's just that it's a pretty original film, never seen anything quite like it. Hilarious movie. Either you love it or you hate it.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth seems to keep on getting better and better with each release. There is not one bad song on this album. The leads melodic and just really amazing. The drumming is spectacular. Great riffs. I didn't like the vocals as much as his previous ones. I'm not sure if these guys can produce a bad album. I saw them live a few weeks ago. Awesome show. Buy this album and all their previous death metal outtings.
0060558121|5.0|Shadow is let out of prison early due to the death of his wife.  While travelling home he meets a strange character named Wednesday, who hires him as a personal bodyguard.  Together they set on a journey to collect all the old Gods who came to America, as Wednesday himself is the father-God, and face the final battle against the new American Gods born out of TV, internet, etc. Gaiman superbly describes how each God arrived in America and what happened to them, what our advanced civilization did to them and us. The writing is a masterwork of fiction. A fabulous journey into the world of unreal.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Collateral is easily one of the best movies of the year. In any way there is not one aspect of the movie that is less than great. The director, Michael Mann, who has made a lot of excellent films like Manhunter, The Last Of The Mohicans, and the severely underrated Heat, has made one of his finest films ever. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise takes a different character path than usual as the bad guy in Collateral. The difference in this movie is that the bad guy is the most exciting character and the same guy that a lot of people would rather take sides with than the guy doing the honest and good thing. Tom Cruise does an above excellent acting job and is amazing to watch in this movie. His performance playing the bad guy in Collateral is so perfect, that it clearly stands out and gives him a chance to show an even larger amount of talent on a whole new level. It's actually so good that it is a good enough reason alone to see this film.  <br /> <br />What makes this film better than a lot is the setting, tone, and look that it carries. Add that on top of Cruise's performance, and a better than usual job of acting by everyone in the film and you have a fantastic movie. In the dark night of the city, in a taxi cab and on the streets is where a lot of the movie takes place. The camera shots combined with the just the right cool music give the film a great amount of entertainment. You even have an rare, and unusual artistic touch in a part of the film where music from Audioslave is thrown into at just the right time. Then you see the camera follow a wolf wandering on the streets while Cruise and Foxx are in riding in the taxi cab.  <br /> <br />Michael Mann takes the film in the right direction as usual. He then combines all the elements of a sure winner to come up with a brand new and enjoyable movie that you want to keep watching from the start to the very finish. Collateral is a five star movie that has everything going for it. The most important being that it is highly entertaining and exciting to watch. <br />
B00000272N|4.0|First of all I would like to say that Godsmack sucks and Alice In Chains rule, I never want to hear those two names in the same sentence again, Godsmack Sucks!!  I just had to say that because some people (you know who you are) compare them in reviews.  I will now divert all of my attention to Alice In Chains and I will never again mention Godsuckballs.  I am so glad that Alice In Chains devleoped a newer more original sound for their first LP.  Their earlier demos were done in a more hair bandish style and not to say that its horrible, but if they had stuck with it I would not be a fan.  They certainly came into their own for this album, and they did not 'take advantage of the Seattle scene'.  People say that because their albums are more alternative than their early demos.  They may have changed but what band are they ripping off?  They dont sound anything like Nirvana, more close to Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, but still nothing like them.  The songs on this album are great and set the stage for their greatest achievment two years later: Dirt.  The singles like We Die Young, Man in the Box, and Sea of Sorrow are all great classic songs.  The rest of the songs are all great songs typical of that era in AIC's career.  They have a slow, heavy amazing movement to them that offers nothing but pleasure to listen to.  The downside of the album would come toward the end when songs like I Know Somethin' (Bout' You) show that Alice wasnt quite able to shake off their roots.  All the songs are good though, the only thing bad about the last songs are that they arent as good as the other ones.  This is a great Alice In Chains album and it should be owned by everyone. <br />
B0006GAOBI|4.0|This review concerns the newly released Director's Cut of Donnie Darko.   <br /> <br /> Fans take notice there is a new kid on the block, but it's not all peaches and roses.   <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes have been changed.  Some have had material added.  The music has been changed and moved around.  A few of the original songs are gone from the original DVD, Under the Milky Way, and The Killing Moon are gone.  <br /> <br />  They cut out some stuff too.  The scene with Sparkle Motion is indeed done to Notorious, which I read had originally been changed, it hasnt.  While the song Notorious is still there, the scene has changed in other ways.  No longer do you hear someone from the audience yell, \\"get off the stage Cherita\\" and \\"you suck\\"  during here Autumn Swan dance.  Its weird now, b/c Cherita looks around as does others as if someone had just yelled offensive stuff but since the lines were removed, it just seems strange now. <br /> <br /> So many other changes... I don't want to bore you with that.  Let me get to my point here people. <br /> <br />  If you haven't seen Donnie Darko in any form, skip this one and watch the original DVD release without a doubt.   <br /> <br /> For the majority of you who have seen or own Donnie Darko already, this DVD is nothing more than a appendix to the original.  It tells you more, answers more questions.  But to a large extent, these questions were better left unanswered.   <br /> <br /> I love this film, but I am rather dissapointed with the Director's Cut.  The original DVD cut is much better, the music choices are better, and the pacing is much better. Enjoy the Director's Cut if you are a true fan, but watch the orignal DVD for the rest of your life.
B00000AFGM|5.0|hello. this, for me, its the best emotional and serious album of Mr. Marilyn Manson (Brian Warner). it has 14 songs + a hidden CD-Rom track. these 14 songs contains pain, suffering and all its pointed in the world of drugs which, once we are in, we cannot come back. this album made me think about how life its very important and also, made me think of how the future world can be. i didnt bought the album now in 2005 but, ive got it since i bacame a MM fan in late 1998 when i still was a kid. besides Antichrist Superstar and Holy Wood, this its still the best mature emotional album of Marilyn Manson.  <br /> <br />1.Great Big White World 10/10 (very good song and lyrics) <br />2.The Dope Show 10/10 (awesome song that point in the world famous rockstars and drugs) <br />3.Mechanical Animals 10/10 (at first, i didnt liked it very much but, once i heard all the album like 20 or 100 times, it became my favorite) <br />4.Rock Is Dead 10/10 (whoa!!! this song really rocks also its a good accompaining to the Matrix movie) <br />5.Disassociative 8/10 (very emotional and has very good lyrics and music. Manson feels pain in this song and you can hear him. this song made me cry as this song reminds me all my pains that i had) <br />6.Speed Of Pain 10/10 (another emotional track is besides my heart. I LOVE THIS SONG!!) <br />7.Posthuman 7/10 (not bad at all. this song has quite techno sound. it isnt that great but, its still a good song to forget the pains we had during track 5 and 6. <br />8.I want To Disappear 10/10 (i love this song!! it has very good lyrics and it has a classic rock sound) <br />9.I Dont Like The Drugs 10/10 (not bad at all. this song sounded good as a single + the video its very funny) <br />10.New Model N.15 8/10 (this song points to the main character of the album \\"OMEGA\\". <br />11.User Friendly 10/10 (great song with great pornstars during the lyrics that moans) <br />12.Fundamentally Loathsome 10/10 (very great song! it has a '70 rock sound. you will notbe disappoint) <br />13.Last Day On Earth 7/10 (well, it isnt that bad. but i still listen to it besides the other tracks) <br />14.Coma White 10/10 (man, THIS IS GREAT!! IT HAS ALL THE REASONS TO BE: GREAT VOCAL SOUND, GREAT MUSIC, GREAT LYRICS AND GREAT STAND-OUT TRACK TO FINISH OFF THE ALBUM + ITS VERY LONG THAN THE OTHER TRACKS. IT LENGHTS 5:40) <br />15.Untitled Track 10/10 (this song can be found on the album by put the CD in a PC CD-ROM drive and then, you'll see an animation made by Marilyn Manson. after that, wait some seconds and, you will hear a background song during the animation. well, for me this track its one of my favorites too. its Manson speaking with an alien voice that talks about the end of the humans generation and, the beginning of a new future generation. in this case \\"OMEGA\\" and the Mechanical Animals.  <br /> <br />what more can i say?? dont download the album. just go ahead and buy yourself a copy of this piece of history. i advise you: buy the Explicit Cover that was released for the U.S. only. has it is the 1st print of the 1998 release. new releases has only Manson in front cover with wroted \\"OMEGA\\". this album stand-out to my CD collection also for the great covers. its great to see tha band members of MM in alien style. i like also the design of the CD that it is all white with the words in grey \\"COMA\\" in all the CD. SO, GO AHEAD AND BUY DONT LET THIS PASS YOU BY.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|By the end of the movie, you feel like you have been through a war, and that you have watched one of the best horror films made in the last few years. Saw, which is rated R, is a great horror/suspense movie that takes one part Blair Witch Project, one part Silence of the Lambs and one part Se7en to make a movie that will stay in your head for days to come. <br />With the run of serial killer movies going on right now, Saw's plot might seem familiar: A creepy killer who kidnaps people and tortures them until they die, but Wan and Whannell take that premise and twist it on its head. Of course, like most movie villains, the Jigsaw Killer is really only trying to teach his victims the value of life through mind numbing torture and death.
1582403589|5.0|Let's talk, for a second or two, about the coming Zombie Apocalypse, the subject of Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore's ambitious and brutally beautiful graphic novel series \\"The Walking Dead\\".<br /><br />Let me break the bad news to ya, big guy. You're not going to survive it.<br /><br />Everyone watches zombie flicks with the notion that they'll survive. They're going to be one of the shotgun-toting mall-rustling heroes when it dawns on everybody that the Army ain't showing up.<br /><br />Well let's put it to you this way: the Zombie Apocalypse is coming, and you're not going to make it. You're going to go get your mail, or be carrying your groceries out of the supermarket, and that's when you're going to meet your first Zombie. You've got a billion things flying through your noggin, Champ: pick up the kids, college tuition, your crazy stock portfolio, war and rumors of war, bio-terrorism, the big presentation at the Office tomorrow.<br /><br />The Zombie is very Zen. It clears its mind. It has one single, driving purpose: it wants to sink its yellow tusks into your flesh and sample a little human pad thai.<br /><br />Isn't that the way it always is---these things, like summer guests, always occur when you're just not prepared?<br /><br />That's the guts of \\"The Walking Dead\\". Writer Kirkman states out front that he's less interested in a straight-out horror story---zombies springing out of the darkened woods and chowing down on some filet-au-Bob---than he is in exploring the dark thickets of the human brain exposed to what Kirkman calls \\"Extreme Situations\\".<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />The story follows Kentucky police officer Rick Grimes, thrown into a coma after a routine traffic stop goes bad. Just like \\"28 Days Later\\" he wakes up in an empty hospital. He buzzes on the nurse call-button; nobody shows up to help him. Which is, as we will shortly find out, probably a good thing.<br /><br />Why? Because the hospital---most of it, anyway---is a tomb. Dead. Silent. There's a corpse, supine, fallen between elevator doors, his guts exposed, partially devoured. But for that single dead man, Grimes finds, to his horror, the hospital is deserted.<br /><br />Of course, there's the matter of the lunchroom, stuffed to the grills with the Living Dead.<br /><br />You could call it \\"While you were Sleeping\\", but it's not romantic, and it certainly isn't a comedy. While Grimes was out cold, the World Ended. The Dead Walked, and ate, and infected. Civilization ground to a halt. His town is dead; his house, run down; his wife and son, missing. The neighbor's house claimed by squatters. Word is everyone has gone to Atlanta, where the military has cordoned off the city and is protecting civilians. Grimes, in search of his family, in search of answers, takes a police cruiser and heads South.<br /><br />To be sure, in zombie flicks I always root for the flesh-eaters, and here, whatever Kirkman says, you're reading \\"The Walking Dead\\" to see zombies, not follow a soap opera. But happily, Rackerton invests enough details in these characters to make them compelling: each has an agenda, obsessions, private vices, prejudices.<br /><br />In other words, real people.<br /><br />It certainly doesn't hurt Kirkman's story to have an artist as fine as Tony Moore bringing his vision to life. The black & white panels, the shadings, the crispness of the art---all of it is gorgeous, helping to accentuate the horror, but also to highlight the brutal beauty of a world gone feral.<br /><br />Life, say the Buddhists and Christians, is Suffering. Suffering shapes us, molds us, ennobles us or breaks us apart. This is what is at work in \\"The Walking Dead: Days Gone Bye\\": you see the characters change, shift, mutate, evolve---into stronger creatures, true, and into weaker, viler, sneakier creatures as well.<br /><br />But if this is a hard world, Tony Moore's artwork makes it a bleakly gorgeous one. Take a hard look at the scene around a campfire in a wintery wood, seconds before horror intrudes: the downy snow, the shaded woods of the thicket, the faces sunk in shadow, backlit by the fire.<br /><br />Some scholar once said that the Living can never stand up to the Dead: they are too many, and their hungry, avid minds are not freighted with the conscience of the Living.<br /><br />Kirkman and Moore have put that contention into question in their first auspicious volume of the \\"Walking Dead\\". Doubtless the Dead will Walk, and the Walking will die---but who will survive, and what will become of them?<br /><br />I'm hungry for more.<br /><br />JSGene around a campfire in a wintery wood, seconds before horror intrudes: the downy snow, the shaded woods of the thicket, the faces sunk in shadow, backlit by the fire.  <br /> <br />Some scholar once said that the Living can never stand up to the Dead: they are too many, and their hungry, avid minds are not freighted with the conscience of the Living.  <br /> <br />Kirkman and Moore have put that contention into question in their first auspicious volume of the \\"Walking Dead\\".

B000268QB2|5.0|I just got done watching Keane on Saturday Night Live and I'm taken back by the obvious songwriting quality that Keane demonstrates.  The singer has a flawlessly wonderful voice that carries the soaring melodies to the sky. No need to compare this band to anyone else because it's all about the songs, not the instrumentation. Who cares if they are piano driven. It's all about the notes you play and the melodies you sing. <br /> <br />A fair amount of their songs definetly have that Beatle quality where the verse, bridge and chorus sections are all equally stong. At least that's what I always enjoyed about Beatles.  <br />I just don't hear that kind of consistency anymore in songwriting. So go out and buy real music and real talent while you still have the chance. <br />I can't wait to hear what they will come up with next.  <br />  <br />
