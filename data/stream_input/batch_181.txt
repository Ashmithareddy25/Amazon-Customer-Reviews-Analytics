B00QGQFIBS|4|works well, a little awkward to get used to the strap, but for the price it does the job.
B002J4U8SO|5|We got this for our 5 month old for Christmas. At 7 months, she's really enjoying it.<br />When the car is rolled, the beads inside made a gentle, pleasant, popping noise.<br />It's just the right size for an older baby to handle and move.<br />I would buy this toy again, and it's well priced.
B000IDSLOG|5|I recieved Sophie as a gift when my daughter was three months old and she absolutely adores it. The giraffe's neck and legs are perfect for little hands to grasp. The natural rubber makes it very appealing to chew on. I highly recommend this item!!
B00G92KHEW|2|Not a fan of the plasticky backing on these bibs. It makes them noisy--which for a sleepy baby is no bueno. Also, it tends to flip up a bit and drove my MIL crazy. She watches baby while we're at work and she refuses to use them. We just tossed these all in our giveaway pile and are picking up Green Spouts, Neat Solutions (from Amazon, not the cheaper ones at Target), or Koala brand bibs from now on.<br /><br />They're cute with the lil embroidery on them and are super cheap... but just not for us.
B005VM62QS|5|Great unit and sturdy enough.  Set-up was a snap out of the box.
B00IJ2P4PC|4|Beautiful walker. Tray can be dismounted. Only issue is that walker lower height is higher than my kid so her feet will be in the air for a couple months
B002L3T9XI|5|Both my boys loved these! Great for teething, playing in the car, and to keep them distracted during diaper changes
B007WIR11Y|5|I just received these yesterday and unlike other reviews, they did not smell at all. I haven't had them long enough to see if the coating flakes off, but they are thick and squishy and look very classy with our wood floors. I have a 10 month old who is teething and he has yet to try to chew on them. I would recommend them to anyone who needs play mats and doesn't want the bright colored one. I love them.  I had to order two packages because they do not cover a very large space.
B003ZUXQXU|3|This car seat cover fits our OnBoard 35 Air car seat.  However, I agree with a previous review that it gaps around the handle of the seat.  I also agree that it needs some type of closure device to keep the flap down.  I have sewn a piece of velcro onto it and it solved the problem so I don't know why JJ Cole can't seem to get this figured out.  That said, it seems to keep my baby warm and is a much safer alternative to the bundle-me bag.
B00AJF7OYG|5|Very soft, excellent quality. We bought this for our newborn's first Christmas, but our almost 2 yr old daughter has claimed it for herself! She loves &#34;her&#34; Co-Co monkey! Wish I would have grabbed two when they were $15!
B00B2N0E3M|5|Yes I have been replaced by the soothing vibration. haha my newborn used to HAVE to be ON me to take naps, but thanks to the vibration, she naps happily in the rocker and i can get my dishes done.  my one complaint is that the switch to control the vibration must have a loose wire or something- i have to flip it on off on off on off a few times to make it turn on. I didn't take any stars off for this because I am pretty sure it is just a fluke my specific one has and shouldn't discourage anyone else from buying it, because it is EXACTLY what i needed. some people complain about the changing table only having the two legs and therefor it sags when the baby is in it, i haven't noticed it sagging but  I can see where a heavier baby might make it sag, though i don't know how graco could have made it any other way. other reviews say the basket on the side is useless because it is too shallow but i disagree, if it were bigger i feel like i would bump into it when i was walking, plus it perfectly holds 5 or 6 diapers in one holder, a bag of wipes in the next and the nasal aspirator and pacifiers in the last one. I should have skipped buying all the other baby accessories and just bought two of these, one for upstairs and one for downstairs.
B006SFUEFC|3|When I got this I was pretty disappointed right off the bat. The wood frame is cheap feeling and the plastic webbing is even cheaper feeling. I've had six packs of drinks held by thicker, sturdier plastic.<br /><br />It's fairly easy to use, however, and serves a basic function of a flexible barrier, which I'd trust with crawling kids and young toddlers.  I have a baby daughter who will be crawling soon, and I have family who bring dogs over on occasion and I have wanted to allow the dogs in the house, but not in the whole house.  I'd trust this a lot more with my daughter than with anything but the smallest sorts of dogs.<br /><br />It's really more of a deterrent than a barrier for anyone or anything that wants to get by.  But sometimes a deterrent is enough, certainly enough for crawling babies.<br /><br />As far as length, it opens to 40\\".  The description says 42\\", but that is totally extended, which leaves a wide gap between the two sections, where the webbing doesn't cover.<br /><br />So, this is a functional gate, not necessarily a good one. But, for the price it might be just enough.
B004EBUYRA|5|We love these diaper covers. The lining is wipeable, so you're more likely to be able to use the cover multiple times before washing, and the gussets provide extra leak-protection. Also, we've found the elastic and hook/loop to be very durable.
B00AEATDZ4|5|Gentle and loving to hush a little baby to sleep, pretty and easy to use with lots of nice features
B003HKQ932|5|I was drawn to the colors but was dismayed by the reviews. I purchased two sets with the yellow starfish sponge --great colors of yellow, green, turquoise and orange. When I opened them I felt they were maybe a bit smaller than the ones I found years ago and loved and they were a bit stiffer. I have now washed them up --not thin for the job -and they are soft. I wasn't looking for a thick terry cloth washcloth to use on a baby. The smaller ones rinse out much better on a changing table.<br />The different bright colors keep you from reaching back for the wrong one.<br />These are Delightful and Just Right!<br />And with a baby, you can't have too many washcloths. So I ordered two more sets.<br />They make great facial washcloths, too.
B00C3WDY4W|5|This is a learning product and will be put to good use. Anything to learn with is a great buy.
B001RVMZ9K|5|I loved it when it came in!  The colors and design are beautiful and my daughter wanted her room finished asap when she saw it.  It washed perfectly!  I was afraid of the colors bleeding but there were no problems and they came out of the dryer looking great!
B001D4951C|5|This swaddle has been a lifesaver, seriously. We first bought the newborn size, but our little guy grew out of it but wasn't ready to not be swaddled. He's 3 months now and going strong with this one. It is so much better than other brands or fabrics, because the fleece doesn't stretch too much like cotton swaddles, so you can get them really snug. I will be buying this for all my friends having babies!
B0040A12VW|3|I was under the impression this bag would be bigger then it was.  Other then that, it is a pretty good bag.  The stroller straps are really nice.  I like the colors.  It seems to be made well and so far havn't had any issues.
B009IX5YSI|1|I gave this chair to my daughter at her baby shower.  It sat in the nursery at her home until 5 weeks ago when she delivered, so has not been used very often.  2 weeks ago her husband was sitting in it with the baby and the whole back snapped off!  Luckily, he was able to hold onto the baby and neither were injured.  My husband took a look at the chair and found that the screws that came with it were entirely too short.  He replaced them with some longer ones and we thought the problem had been resolved.  This past weekend a girlfriend of my daughter's was gliding in chair with the baby and one of the arms came loose and part of the gliding mechanism came apart.  This chair should definitely be recalled!  I would like a full refund as well.  Including shipping!  One last thing.....when the chair arrived back in April, it came in a box that looked like it had been pieced together.  Very tacky!  Please give this matter your immediate attention.  Linda Egley
B001R1I44U|1|These are supposed to be leak-proof but I am constantly cleaning up after the cup is turned on its side. I hoped I had gotten a faulty one but I have purchased six and they all leak.
B00G34TIDW|5|easy to install and use.
B008CDCKP0|5|The best lovely for a baby-toddler. Light, very soft, curly tail and nose are the best parts to play with for small fingers.
B005555KD2|5|We got this wet bag to use to transport dirty diapers home from the sitter's house.  We've been using it for 3 months and have not yet seen any leaks, and it keeps all the smells contained (don't take a deep breath when you're opening a full bag, though!).  Our first sitter was a friend of ours, so she would just fill the bag for a whole week and we'd bring it home to dump the diapers in to the diaper service bag for weekly pickup and there was never any space issue.  I never pulled them out to count how many fit, but this was when little miss was 3 months old and going through 80+ diapers a week.  When I wash it, I just turn it inside out and toss it in with the rest of her laundry.
B009UO3G2Q|5|It is so light, I can carry it with my boy to everywhere. only one suggest, buy the one have shed. This one is good, but not good for the summer and the rainning day.
B0035LLG2W|3|I was excited to try this bottle warmer out when I got it off my registry, but after 4 months of use I am honestly disappointed.  I expected better quality from a Dr. Brown's product as I swear by their bottles, but this did not live up to my expectations.  I followed all directions as far as heating times are concerned an use Dr. Brown bottles, and yet I am still disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Doesn't take up a lot of space<br />-Easy to use, literally 4 buttons, no confusion at all<br />-I like the basket insert so you can take the bottles in and out<br />-Easy to fill water reservoir<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It doesn't heat the bottles evenly.  On more than one occasion the nipple of the bottle has been boiling hot and the bottom of the bottle is still cold.<br />-If you forget to check to see if the water reservoir is full before using, get ready for a bottle that is bordering volcanic temperatures.<br />-The buttons are easy to use, however, they have the tendency to stick.<br />-Also, when warming one bottle after the other (I have twins), you have to turn the warmer off after warming the first bottle and then reset the warming time again.  Its a big pain.<br />-It is extremely difficult to clean.<br /><br />I wish I could say that I was happy with this product, but honestly I am not.  I feel like placing the bottles in hot water for the same amount of time it takes to use the bottle warmer seems to do a better job.
B006LKX0XC|3|Did not work well w medela bottles. Concept is great but I wish I didn't buy this. She enjoys it as a ball like toy. Probably will get passed to the dog.
B003I868DY|5|I simply love this item. I make my own organic vehhies and fruit mixes. Currently we mix veggies, fish and rice or potato, in the blender it goes. I own the [[ASIN:B000SAU3OU Hamilton Beach 54615 Wavestation Express Dispensing Blender with 48-Ounce Jar, Black]] and poor the food right in the cubes and in the freezer they go. They come right out the next day. Very easy to clean. I bought a second one to make fruit as well. I initially purchased the [[ASIN:B00440CZPU Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack]], they are a pain and only make 1 oz. These are a gem and a must have. By the way, did you know that babies that are fed store bough jar food become the most picky eaters, because they are watered down so much, the poor kids are not use to flavor.
B004CLYYL4|5|I got these today for my 4 month old and love them, They are large enough to use for months and they dont have the plastic backing I hate!!! I think bibs should be soft and comfy and these are!!! Plus the neck size is large enough my son can use them for months to come
B005WHQKI2|4|Good carseat. My only complaint is that it is very difficult to adjust the straps in the rearfacing position. They need to come up with better placement of the strap adjuster. Other than that no issues and my son seems to like it just fine.
B000XMHTJU|5|This baby food processor is easy to use and efficient. It is also a snap to clean. This would make an excellent and much appreciated gift for any new mother.
B00E8KJYNC|5|Haven't used it yet, wanting on baby to come. It appears to be easy, just like the coffee maker. I believe I will be very pleased with it.
B002SG7JSK|5|We used this to cover the edge of some tile rather than a table.  I only wished I would have done it sooner to prevent one injury.  It was easy to install and adhesive is still in place and working well!
B009FRKXKG|5|My daughter loves her cot! Slept on it the secind I washed it and for the entirety of our vacation. Never complained of it being uncomfortable or anything. Love it when I find quality products!
B0001E717K|5|I love this toy bag.  This bag is great for holding all of my baby's favorite rattles and stuffed toys.  It keeps everything within reach, so there is no more bending and digging to the bottom of the big toybox.  It holds alot of toys.  Before this bag we kept the same amount of toys in the nolonger used cradle (one layer completely covering the matress).  When the toy bag is properly secured to the end of the crib my baby is still visible.  The top of the bag is at about the same level as the top of the bumper pad (matress at highest level).  The color of this bag is a medium yellow not too sunny or pastel.  The white trim has a great texture and makes big beautiful bows.
B00KN0TPNA|5|Whenever I told anyone I was using cloth diapers they thought I was crazy but these inserts are super absorbent and are a great alternative to disposable diapers.  We have the plain inserts as well and wow are they soaked when I change him but allowing the same amount of time for the charcoal inserts and they are barely wet to the touch! They are a bit bulky but I just started using them on my 2 month old son who is about 13 pounds already so he will quickly grow into using the diaper shell with these inserts.  I do not recommend them for any baby smaller than this size or you will be buttoning the diaper under the armpits ;)
B0071LFEX4|4|I loved this stuffed animal, it is very soft, but it is not actually 12 inches, more like 8 inches.
B00O2VPFHG|5|Awesome Finding Nemo set for a great price!
B000MAJB3U|4|This product arrived on time but the box was slightly damaged and so was the stroller. I don't think it's the fault of the company, I blame UPS from whom I routinely receive damaged boxes. I would buy from them again but warn them about UPS.
B0034J50AY|5|Its my 15 month old's favorite toy. The fabric is very soft. The colors are good. It is the right size for him.
B000BUTCS0|4|got this seat belt for my little brother and he loved it.. its fun and safe and all the kids are wearing one now!
B000GELDXS|4|After being used very gently less than 10 times, one of the straps that fastens my Buggy Bagg to the shopping cart just fell off when I was fastening it the other day.  I wrote to their customer service department, and they promptly replaced my Buggy Bagg, no questions asked!  I am very pleased with the customer service I received, and I hope that the replacement Buggy Bagg is more durable!    I like that this cart cover really does cover all germy cart surfaces.  It is very easy to attach to the cart.  I don't use the pillow that comes with it, but the toy loops and cup holders are nice.  My daughter loves to sit on her Buggy Bagg and play with her toys as we shop!  I am overall pleased with my choice of shopping cart covers.
B000K50780|4|Works as described
B0070U6R9Q|5|very good product
B000CSBP3G|3|+ looks great for me<br />+ easy to clean<br />- very big for 7m old, sits on her laps<br />- uncomfortable for baby, stiff<br />- too big gap around neck OR stiff plastic will touch baby's skin
B008J1QOI4|5|Very cute!! Great size.... Was pleasantly surprised it was bigger than expected! Perfect!!
B0038JE3R6|2|Its too small
B006P3BCDA|5|Great to help little ones be independent!!!
B00921HYU2|5|I had my baby in September 2010 and had started with the Chico travel system. I was frustrated with how hard it was to fold and how uncomfortable it seemed for my daughter. One of my girlfriends had sent me a list of must have baby items and this was at the very top. I decided it was time for a change and bought the 2011 Indie bumbleride in Seagrass.<br /><br />At first I was just so happy to have such a beautiful stroller. The colors are great, the material is quality, and the frame is gorgeous. I feel pretty good pushing my daughter around in such a great stroller.<br /><br />After I started using it regularly I fell in love. The ride is beyond smooth. I jog and we often go to the park and this handled the terrain perfectly. I also can't get over how easy it is to fold up, and it's light weight. The canopy is huge and keeps my babe covered.  It also zippers which I love so I can see her nap while we're walking.  She also loves being able to lay completely flat on her back while in the stroller.  I am so happy with my purchase of the Bumbleride and constantly talk about it.<br /><br />I recently upgraded to the jet blue 2012 model to give grandma the old one and we are beyond thrilled with our bumblerides. Now that I have my son we also for the indie twin.  Just as great, just a little heavy.  This was the best money I spent on a baby product and I can't recommend it enough! Enjoy your bumbleride!<br /><br />Sidenote: Their customer service is beyond great as well. We blew a tire, replaced it, only for it to blow again.  I called Bumbleride thinking something might be suspect within the wheel.  They sent me a knew wheel, no charge, no shipping, no hassle.  Amazing interaction with this compnay.
B0012LZD4Y|4|Cute and stylish.  Great value for these bibs, they do shrink a bit.  Easy to clean, just toss in the washer.
B00005YYE3|5|...on any other cups!  These are wonderful.  I wished I had tried these before Gerber ones, which leaked and are not vented so when my baby sipped, bubbles built up inside the cups.  Not with these vented truly spill-proof Playtex.  The various designs are very cute and insides are easy to clean.  Target has some on sale now, a few dollars cheaper than TRU/BRS. Love these cups so much we have 6!
B0041RRX6M|5|We have had these for about 8. Months. My now 15 month old still loves playing with these. And I like that they are functionable and I can us to rinse her.
B006BDNP4I|5|EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!
B001IDYMTI|5|After considering many of the very similar, extremely high priced strollers on the market and deciding it just wasn't in the budget, we decided on Kolcraft. This stroller is awesome. It has a nice, cushy seat, rolls smoothly, has awesome shade coverage. I love that it can face me or out, as my son is only 7 months old and I think still more comfortable being able to see us most of the time. The basket is huge, the handle is comfortable and a good height for both me (at just over 5 ft) and my husband, who is 6 ft. For the price, I don't think there is a better stroller on the market.  Thanks to other reviews, I chose the 4-wheeler instead of the 3, which I was considering, because they said the seat height was too low.  This seat seems perfect and will last us a long time.  I do wish the snack tray could move down/closer to the baby, but I know in just a few months it will be at the perfect spot for him and that is such a minor complaint compared to how happy I am with our purchase!    One thing- this stroller is not lightweight! We have a Toyota Tundra with a shell on it, and I have to really heave this sucker to get it up into the truck bed! Overall I am thrilled with this stroller and highly recommend it.
B0081K0RG8|1|The flimsy cover provided with these bottles suck. They're hard to get on and are easily lost.  The trekka baba (similar sippy) cover is MUCH better and I would give this bottle a much better review if the flimsy cover was replaced with stainless steel.
B000P7WAII|5|When dining out my son seemed to love this high chair so I ordered it.      Assembled it in no time.  I forgot to put the strap around the bar infront of the child seat so I had to loosen the screw but it was no problem.  Instruction wasn't clear on that part but it wasn't too hard to figure out.    My son love sitting on here.  I have a Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat - Red/White that i purchased prior to this.  And the table for it fits perfectly with this high chair so I got 2 long velcro strap from local hardware store and strapped it on for a high chair with a table.
B003QODWMA|5|I fussed over the internet searching for which baby carrier to get.  I decided many times, but purchased the MobyWrap first off.  The thing was neat once it was on, but definitly time consuming and difficult with a fussy baby I'm sure.  I returned the Moby and searched for a different carrier.      I debated for the longest time and ended up purchasing this Pikkolo and am very pleased with it!!  I liked the mei tais, but ended up preferring the buckles over trying to tie the carrier and I'm very happy with my decision - those buckles are fantastic!  I'm sure the ties wouldn't be that bad, but the buckles make putting baby in and getting situated much quicker.  ..And when baby wants OUT, baby is out in 5 seconds or less.    My little girl is only two weeks old and we've been shopping, to the parade, on walks . . She loves it!  She'll be awake for the first half, just enjoying being cozy with mommy, then she'll fall asleep comfortably.  This carrier is nice around the house too, especially those times where I'm trying to actually get something done and she's just wanting to be held.     In a nutshell this carrier is very sturdy, looks nice, doesn't take much space to store, is a cinch to put on and take off, keeps baby happy during those fussy times. . .I'm happy with this purchase, and I haven't even been able to try the back carry or front facing carry yet.  Once she's bigger than her 8 1/2 lb frame we'll get to those.  For now, she loves the typical front carry and so do I :)
B00AH8J448|5|Thick,soft, and very absorbant. These inserts have exceeded my expectations.<br />They have held up to every wash and have maintained there softness!
B00FE8BJ6C|4|I used this as a way to keep my toddler close to me while traveling. It is not meant to pull them back like you would a pet. It is meant to remind them to not run far away from you.
B004TES3CK|1|Horrible.. Don't expect the permanent writing to stay on. Even with industrial strength Sharpie permanent marker, it just wipes right off after it dries. I even tried to rough up the surface of the silicone with a Dremel rotary tool to see if the lettering would stay better.. umm.. nope, still wipes right off. Waste of money.
B00APSYDFK|5|These are great I have been using them for over 6 months and are still in good condition. I use them every day for my 4 year olds lunch at preschool. All I do is turn them inside out rinse them off, sometimes I need soap depending on what was in there and hang them to dry for about an hour. so much better the using ziplock bags every day -what a waste of money. I would recommend these to anyone.
B00I3LDYB0|5|Great condition!
B00IOGIM9S|4|This chair is really convenient to take on vacation. We've taken it to 2 different locations and it worked great on both trips. One side of ours is a little &#34;sticky&#34; and difficult to adjust, but it holds on tight.
B000BONXAO|1|I bought it to help learn how to use Chopsticks and it was not easy to use and felt very awkward holding it
B0052QYLUM|2|This monitor worked well for about 6 months, and then it began to beep loudly and shut off despite being charged.  I bought a new battery specifically made for this monitor and it began working well again for ABOUT 1 WEEK.  I'm so disappointed.  We are going to need to buy a new monitor since this one screams in the middle of the day, afternoon, and night (heck, any old time) due to the battery needing to be charged- EVEN THOUGH IT IS PLUGGED IN :(.  Boo.
B004FOZKL6|5|very absorbant; softer than many prefolds I've used.  Hold up nicely after many washing; these do not stain as easily as my other prefolds.
B0069MDVDG|5|This Diaper Tote has tons of pockets with a great color and is well made. I am very happy and pleased!
B000L9JNNK|5|I bought this for a baby's Easter Basket.  I was perfect, very soft and easy to snuggle and just the right size!
B00BZAFPOK|3|My daughter got Violet last year for Christmas, it is her absolute favorite toy. This is a toy for children that is not water friendly. She was taking a bath I turned for a towel and found she had violet in the tub, it has not been more then a stuffed doll since. For the price they sell these for I would hope that they could make the wiring sealed, after all these things do happen.
B001QGKXA4|3|Doesn't stick to our glass tiles, but does stick to the bathtub itself.
B00CXSPL24|5|I spent a lot of time researching good products for freezing breast milk.  The Kiinde twist bags are what I kept coming back to.  I decided on the starter kit since it's so well priced for all that it comes with.  I've been using it for a few months now and I don't have any complaints.  It's nice to know that pieces of the kit will work well for baby food too in the near future.  The freezer bags keep a tight seal and I haven't had any leaks,  which was most important for me.
B005ZBHXPE|5|This booster is easy to clean and I really like the color :)
B002SG7JSK|3|I ended up not using it on my table because I was concerned the glue would damage the finish. Maybe if you have a table without a glossy finish you'd be okay.
B009ICN71K|5|My daughter absolutely loves it. Have had it for a almost ten months now and it's one of the toys she comes back to again and again.
B0017VVUOQ|5|This is a good car seat with good features.<br /><br />PROS<br />Latch:  The best part of this is having latch.With Latch i can install the car seat in less then 2 minutes.Moreover latch makes me feel comfortable that the car seat will not move an inch after installation.<br />Fabric:  Many people staying in warm places may feel the fabric not comfortable.Me being in Chicago,and in winter weather fell this very comfortable.My baby feel comfortable even after 5-6 hours in this car seat.<br />Foam:This comes with a foam to support baby during jerks.I think it handles well.<br />Chico:Initially i was inclined towards Chico Keyfit 30.But this has almost all the features which expensive Keyfit has.especially the latch.<br />Belts:The 5 point harness is very easy to use.Keyfit 30 best feature was its belts.So far i had no problem with the belts in this car seat.The front adjustment is very easy to use.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Boot:Someone who is interested in the boot may not find it useful.I never used it as it covers only the feet.Instead i purchased a cozy cover for winter.<br />Handle:I feel extremely uncomfortable with the handle.Once baby is in the car,it is difficult to reach on both sides of the car seat to bring the handle straight.So i tied one side with a wire.So when i need to move handle either side i just press the lock on one side .
B000I2Q0CW|5|I have to say, out of all of my sons toys this is by far his favorite.  I remember reading reviews for this product before that weren't very good because the mothers said that this product didn't do much.  That's the point.  It doesn't do much, which is great for a little one (and mom's sanity after hearing and seeing all the other toys out there).  There's a colorful strap on the side that baby can grab easily and swing the jar or carry around with him when he gets older.  Our baby also likes to chew on it.  There are three light up balls inside.  Our boy carries them around and chews on them.  He loves to follow them and likes to tap them together.  A new thing I tried the other day was juggling with them.  The boy just laughed and laughed.  Our son also likes to chew on the lid.  With the lid closed our boy hits the top like a drum and watches the fireflies light up.  The top of the lid is really neat as well.  It looks like a fly's view.  It's hard to describe in any other way.  This toy makes no sounds besides the clicking and clacking of the balls hitting together.  And they're not extremely bright when they light up.  They just flicker a nice yellow light and turn off on their own.  Believe me, this toy would make a welcome addition to your home.
B001QXCF0S|5|I ordered these after purchasing one at a local store to try out.  My 12 month old daughter loves using these.  They are easy for her to get the liquid out and I love that they have a fliptop closure to keep hte straw clean.  The cups are easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning.
B000YVKOFG|5|I make a point of buying American Apparel for my kids. Their clothes come in great colors & are incredibly sturdy. They hold up to many washes, remain soft & comfortable & the colors stay fresh looking. I love them!
B001CWFBLI|5|My son loves anything soft and these sheets don't disappoint. Easy to clean and put on the mattress.
B008HCXIU2|5|This works GREAT!!! Its one of the best back seat mirrors I've come across.  Its got 2 buckles that install it securely to any backseat headrest. The mirror is large and you get a really great view of your rear facing baby's carseat. The mirror also pivots to suit whatever angle you need it at. I love it and highly recommend it over the other gooey looking baby mirrors. I've tried them all and this is by far the best I've tried.
B007ZV1GDM|5|Great product.
B002SG775U|5|I bought this to use as a handbag, not as a diaper bag. Call me crazy. This is one cool bag.
B00AHPZZEO|3|It does the job but not as I'd hoped. I used an older Chicco seat for my son at a friends last November and fell in love, but then when this arrived I found the design had changed and was disappointed. I was careful to order the exact same seat she had, per description, but with the newer models they have changed the clasp system - which was part of what made the older style great! This seat is also smaller than the old model and is lighter, which in this case isn't better. When I go to adjust the seat height, I have to stand on the bottom bar so the whole chair doesn't move.<br /><br />I'm keeping it because I don't want to deal with a return (and meanwhile have no place to sit my son for meals) but I wouldn't buy it again.
B001H0GF4C|3|I bought this pump to travel with as a substitute for my Medela. They are completely different. This one is louder and has less power than the Medela.
B0083WVGTG|5|this thing is a life saver... our 22 month old is essentially potty trained (diapers at night only) and that would not have been possible without the flexibility this device offers us.  We can pull over on the shoulder while traveling, use it hiking, or use it in a public bathroom.  It folds up compactly and is sturdy enough that I can trust it.  This whole potette system is worth the cash.
B00DLZ14GA|5|Our center absolutely Loves This Product!
B007SP1XTW|5|This is an awesome idea. I used to cringe when going out to restaurants and watching the tables get wiped down with a germy rag and then having baby pick up dropped food or tap his little hands on the table and then stick them in his mouth. This is much more sanitary.  At 12 months and 31 inches tall, it is still a little to high for him but we make it work.
B0062PQTR0|5|perfecto
B000056HKF|4|We ordered this bedding set for our son's nursery and could not be happier with it.  It is of good quality and looks absolutely adorable.  We decided to hang up the comforter on the wall opposite his crib with quilt hangers since we wouldn't actually be using the comforter for some time.  It is much too large to put over a baby.  It looks wonderful on the wall and helps take up some room.  I would definitely recommend this bedding set.
B00QRSOO4M|5|Great back support for my 3 month old daughter who is just learning to sit up! She loves it and it has helped with her neck strength also.
B002T5Q01C|5|works like it is supposed to. blocks the poopie from the cloth diaper. the only way to use budroux butt cream with cloth diapers.
B00QHO2ILM|4|Nice quality bedding. I bit overpriced, thus the loss of one star.
B004GJXMAQ|4|Wasn't my first choice in covers, but it fits great and is made of very soft material. Also has holes for the buckle/strap, which I really liked.
B00HHGTMNG|4|Didn't work completely for me but skin improved.
B0010WFVRO|5|My little one is three months old and loves to stand with my help of course, but my arms were always getting so tired so i saw this and he loves it. He is still a little wobbly in but if i put blanket behind him he jumps and stands. When he gets a little stronger he will love it even more. great item for active babys.
B000OFT3FY|1|So as I sit here and look at a pile of diapers that cost a small fortune but no longer get any use I felt compelled to write review so that others can learn from our experience.  For our first child we did an exhaustive search for what appeared to be the best cloth diaper.  From what we could gather it was the Bum Genius.  Then we calculated the expected cost of cloth diapers over a child vs paper diapers.  One child's worth of paper diapers would cost the same as 12 Bum Geniuses.  We went out and bought 12 and used them for the first 12 months of our first child's life.  When we first got them they were fantastic.  We would have easily written a 5 star review.  We were really impressed with them.  They looked so comfortable, and we felt so good about putting cloth diapers on our child it was easy to put up with the daycare's crazy requests because we were using cloth diapers, and the daily rituals of standing around the washing machine stuffing diapers for the next day.  We started to run into issues pretty quickly though.  We had the issues with the waterproofing giving out, with leaky diapers because if you don't fit them just right...., and odors that were difficult/impossible to get rid of.  However our number one two and three gripes have to do with the Velcro tab system.  First of all, our third gripe, at about 1 month the washing machine tabs became all but useless, initially they were almost useless.  You may be thinking that it is not a big deal, but it leads to the some of our other gripes. Most importantly is our second gripe.  The Velcro is very destructive to the other clothes in the laundry load even the other diapers if it is not battened down.  It acts like sandpaper.  Even if we just washed the diapers one at a time the Velcro on one diaper without the benefit of laundry tabs would destroy that diaper.  At any rate our original calculations called for one load a day  (for water, electricity, etc.).  Also when the Velcro is not battened down the hooks tend to catch all manner of detritus which needs to be cleaned out or the Velcro simply doesn't work.  Our number one gripe is that even with the best care my guess is that the Velcro will give out before you are finished needing the diaper.  Ours started falling off the baby at about a year., and have been essentially useless for the second child even though she has had the benefit of another 10 diapers, mostly of the fuzzy buns variety, which snap--be gone evil Velcro.  When we contacted the company about the Velcro issues they were not really very supportive.  They accused us of not washing the diapers with the utmost care, of not having at least 30 per child, and offered to send us new Velcro at a $1 a diaper which we needed to sew in.  Now 30 diapers at Bum Genius prices would pay for 2.25 children worth of paper diapers, and since I can't expect these to last more than one child, they must have some other benefit, right?  They are better for the environment-I don't think so--they are totally synthetic--i.e. made from oil and chemicals.  At least the paper diapers are in part made from a renewable resource.  Well they must potty train the child faster because the child can feel when they are wet?  Your milage may vary, but we do not have any prodigies in that department at 1.5 years  and 3 years.    I am giving them one star because no one reads the three two or three star reviews.  I would give them two or three stars because they were really cool initially and there was a certain level of superiority with the statement, \\"We are using cloth diapers with our children.\\"  In fact I still like them, as they sit useless in the corner of this very room I am sitting in.  I did note, as I wrote this review, that they have redesigned the laundry tabs, and the type of Velcro, for the new 4.0 version--they must have had a lot of problems with it, huh.  It is so nice that they blamed us the end consumer for their failure when we asked them to help us with their product.  Really disappointing customer service probably makes them most deserving of one star.
B00HVL4I5O|1|I sincerely regret ordering this item. There was only ONE pair of pants, not five. They were cheaply made and ugly. Not worth 25$ AT ALL. They were in cheap plastic wrapping. The return address was from somewhere in Las Vegas. The product was from a different country. The writing on the tags and instructions was in a different language.<br />I have a very busy schedule and now I have to take the time to send it back. If I could give zero stars, I would. Do not buy this product! It's a scam.
B0090IBQSI|5|Excellen
B004TYOJNW|4|Received this product today. Very impressed with the quality as with anything from baby jogger. The hychair comes in a carry bag to make it easier to take around with you. Unfortunately our table at home has a 4 inch wide edge that is set back 2 inches underneath from the table top edge. This makes it impossible for the hychair to fit securely to our table. Works well on our kitchen bar top and our son loves sitting in it. Will test it at a restaurant this weekend. Confident we will get a lot of use out of this product
B00L490N4E|2|Poorly made, heavy material and  the elastic is too weak. I ended up purchasing another nursing bra that works better.
B006VZ50BC|4|I really like these blankets. Although I didn't quite use these for swaddling our baby (our's is a very wiggly one and has never met a swaddle he can't beat to free his arms), it is very soft on baby's skin and breathable enough to avoid overheating. It has a stretchable quality to it - so it does allow some room for arms/legs movements after swaddling, but that also makes it easy for the little ones to break free from the swaddle.  I generally use it as sheet for my son to sleep on and I swear he sleeps better on them (guess he likes it's soft feel).
B00019JK9M|4|I originally bought these hangers for decoration in my daughter's room, but ended up using them for what they're intended for--hanging clothes.  I had bought regular plastic hangers, but they are hard to move through on the closet rods because the hook is kind of small.  I love how these fit on the rod and how they fit children's clothes so perfectly.
B004B762AK|5|I got this as a present for my sister after she had my 2nd niece. Helped her set it up. It works great, is simple to use. Good clear image and sound. She liked the ability that it can scan between cameras with sound and video. And also that she could talk to the girls. She has only had a month or so, but nothing has failed on it.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that the dock is a little light and will stick to the viewer. true you do need to hold the charging dock when you pick it up. But every thing else is solid and has a good sturdy feel. Very pleased.
B004BFRNIC|5|We just replaced our old double with this double and WE LOVE IT!!! The old double had steering issues because of the weight of our \\"older\\" child sitting in it with our youngest but this new one is A-MAY-ZING! My 4 yr old and 3 yr old AND my 20 month old all fit in it (even though its only a double) and it is a breeze to push... the place for your \\"Big Kid\\" in the back is big enough for both our 4 yr old to stand and our 3 year old to sit while pushing our little one in front...it is HEAVEN<br /><br />We thought the weight of all 3 at once might be an issue but it definitely is not. It is still way easy to push and corners like a dream.<br />4yr old: 42 lbs<br />3yr old: 41 lbs<br />20 month old: 32 lbs<br />(The last two are pretty big for their age but yes the weights are correct)<br /><br />Would recommend it to anyone.
B001FQZAM6|5|Works great very easy to install and keeps my granddaughter out of harms way. Would purchase again if I needed more.
B00009VE6W|3|This was the first baby carrier I tried, and I did use it from the time my daughter was a newborn until about 4 months of age. It was snug and comfortable. However, it took so long to put on, I ended up getting rid of it. Here's my analysis of this carrier: <br /> <br />Pros:  <br />1. Soft and comfortable for baby <br />2. Easy to move about and do chores while wearing <br />3. Not as expensive as many carriers  <br />4. Fairly compact <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1. Takes a long time to put on - think about trying to get into this thing while your little one is screaming to be held <br />2. Sags over time - after an hour or so I would need to tighten it a bit, which would sometimes wake my daughter. In the sling position she would often end up lying nearly horizontal at my waist, and I would worry about my breasts smothering her. <br />3. Not good for mall trips - the tails are on the floor as you tie it up so the ground will touch this then by tied around you next to baby <br /> <br />Do I recommend this product? If you are exceedingly patient, then you'll be fine. If not, you'll want something else. I ended up going with the Kangaroo Korner Adjustable Cotton Pouch - super easy to wear and use.
B001AQO1GC|5|fun
B000BGFI82|5|We borrowed this from a friend for our first baby.  Now they are using it during our second so we'll have to order one.  I loved the gentle soothing music and lights that it has, and so did my son.  Really convenient being portable.
B000BF6UVC|4|This fits nicely with sewn holes where the carrier upper straps go through. It keep my baby warm while walking out in cold temperatures. We don't go on long hikes, but when taking the dog for a walk around the neighborhood he never cries.<br /><br />The only drawback is that it is slightly annoying to take on and off. Not a huge pain, but annoying enough that I just leave it strapped to the carrier.
B004HWXCJS|5|I'm a only pumping mom, and I love this pump it comes with a storage container and ice pack for pumping on the go, the back is nice like another purse. You can adjust the speed to your liking. I don't like that the tubing gets lots of condensation in it you have to run pump after pumping in order to dry them out. otherwise parts are easy to clean!!!
B000262HMQ|5|We bought this along with the JL Childress Standard and Dual Stroller Travel Bag for our recent plane trip.  Overall great bags for the money.  We have the Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat and stroller system and these bags fit no problem.  We checked the car seat through to our destination (no charge for car seats) and loaded it up with extra clothes and diapers.  Bag made it through both flights without a scratch.  The stroller bag was also great and we gate checked it.  Highly recommend both.
B00H8MSEWY|5|Super easy to install, much easier then my diono radian rxt.
B0038JE60U|4|So far this product has met my expectations. Tons of bottles and sippy cups and accessories fit on it. My only complaint is that the excess water stays in it, it doesn't have a slope for the water to run off.
B000BFP0HC|5|Easy to clean and catches the mess! Have one for home and I am considering purchasing another one for day care.
B00GJVLNHS|4|Make sure to read the description. This is a MINI crib sheet. I didn't realize that until I had washed it and tried unsuccessfully to fit it on my daughter's crib mattress. So, unfortunately, I can't speak to how this sheet fits over a mini crib mattress, but what I can say is that the design is adorable, and the sheet washes really well. Honestly, the fabric feels thicker and of better quality than my Carter's crib sheets. I like the sheet so much that I'm going to order one in the regular crib size for my soon-to-be-born son.
B00913DY3W|5|Baby loves it, she is 14 weeks and it fits perfectly in her tiny hands. she doesnt yet have a good sense of holding objects but she is really trying with this one and enjoys chewing on it. even  in her awkwardness at least one of the feet get into her mouth
B002GAY07Q|5|I love these baby spoons! they are soft and rubbery so they do not hurt my sons mouth like some harder/plastic spoon can and they hold the food well. We got some of these as gifts from my wife's baby shower and after using several other spoons, these are the only ones that I want to use. It is true that they may be prone to some discoloration because they are white and rubbery, but they are very functional. Great for shoveling pureed turnips and sweet potatoes along with other foods that babies need to have.
B001UF8BL4|5|GREAT!
B001HLFPMY|4|I got this for my daughter and when put together with the Valance, Hamper and all the accessories, the room looks like it belongs in a magazine!  It is high quality and I would buy it again.  BUT, I'm only giving it 4 stars because I wanted to get the comforter set in a twin size once my daughter outgrew her toddler bed.  I couldn't find it anywhere and even contacted Trend Lab to find out where I could buy it.  They said they don't make it in a twin sized pattern & have no plans to do so.  I finally found the Pam Grace set in a twin and it is not the same pattern, but is pretty darn close.  So don't hesitate buying this Trend Lab set if you are worried about graduating to a twin set & keeping the rest of the accessories like I did.  Pam Grace is close enough and this Trend Lab set is too cute to pass up!  Highly recommend getting this!
B00IN8OI4A|3|These aren't &#34;no spill&#34;, just &#34;less spill&#34;. The spout is a bit hard to clean. Baby likes them more than other brands and styles and has learned to drink from them, so 3/5 stars.
B001LQCOIS|3|OK, so the machine itself when we first got it was good. Then i washed it and saved it for baby number two and all went downhill. It was not even over a year before I used it again. The steam didn't steam properly and the blade got dull fast. I called customer service and got condescending answers and telling me i needed to re purchase all of the items. Then they said it should be better. I told if it doesn't will you give me my money back or may i return the items and she said no. I needed to redo it many more times and I am not doing it right. I don't get how many ways you can push a friggin switch but regardless I am going not recommending this or will I buy another one ever again.
B004Y9AKZI|5|We used the bassinet and when our grandson outgrew the bassinet we purchased a mattress and he sleeps in this the pack n play. The mattress/pad that it comes with is more for play than sleep. Finding a mattress was easy (we purchased Dream On Me 3&#34; Inner Spring). The Pack N Play has held up for a year so far and we will use it as long as we can!
B001H9NXCK|5|I bought this toy for my 15 month old, her teacher had it and she loved to play with it.  It is great for fine motor skills, she loves to put the rings in and seems to hold her interest quite a bit.  She likes to put them all in and then dump it and likes to put the lid on by herself and put the rings in over and over again. I think it is great for little ones, my daughter happens to have down syndrome so I thought this would be really good to work on fine motor skills development, but I was afraid she wouldn't play with it for that long because she was already fifteen months old. Now 10 months later, she still picks it up every now and then to put the rings in. Another toy she loved, same idea as this, I picked up at toys r us was called milk and cookies it was a plastic milk jug with a slit at the top with 5 different color and textured plastic cookies you put in the top and when you tilt it, it makes a cow sound.
B0001EM8I2|5|One for me, one for my daughter with a two year old who, along with his car seat, trade off between cars.<br />I love it, as somehow whatever he happens to snack on in the car - you try going any distance with a toddler without food -<br />finds it's way into and around his car seat.<br />This catches it very well, thank you very much!! Sometimes I augment coverage with a towel over the backseat [new car] because the water bottle may be dropped with the pop top up, or an apple slice drop outside the perimeter.<br />I believe this well help reduce the wearing away of the fabric around his car seat area as well
B007BEHSDU|4|Was great for our hockey game!  My five month old ended up falling asleep with them on and the noise didn't wake him :)
B004GTLRY4|5|I originally bought these to use as burp cloths, and as far as that use goes, they are wonderful.  Nice and cushy (after a wash or two) and very absorbent. However one day when we ran out of prefolds from our diaper service, I decided to stuff my flip covers with these rather than run out for disposables.  I have to say that they are fantastic.  I think that if I ever decide to cancel my service I will use these exclusively.  They absorb the breastfed poop extremely well...almost nothing on the cover!  And they dry super quick on a clothesline (and not even bad to handwash if it comes to it...maybe something to keep in mind for those who like to camp?).  Only wish that I had registered for more on my baby registry.
B000096NQU|5|Let me lead off by saying that I'm a first-time expectant mom due on 10/5, so I'm still clueless about most things, especially breastfeeding. Anyway, I originally registered for the Isis Back-to-Work manual pump (mostly because the price of this pump scared me a bit), but a trusted friend and first-time mom recently advised me to register for this pump and not even bother with the hand pump.  <br /> <br />I'd still like to use the Avent bottles, though, so I was intrigued by the reviews that mention using an Avent adapter with this pump. I didn't see anything on this Web site that seems to fit that bill. My friend pumps and pours, but it would be great to find a product to eliminate that extra step. Any advice would be much appreciated. <br /> <br />(By the way, I wasn't able to post this without rating the item. Since I haven't used it yet, I based my rating on the glowing recommendation of my friend and others I've talked to.)
B00AMLEQOS|5|Very pretty, nice quality!
B0000CBGBS|4|Our 3 week old son loves this chair! He sleeps very well in it and I can carry him from room to room in it while he snoozes. Ours is almost always on the vibrate feature and the batteries seem to last forever! We haven't had to change them yet (after over 3 weeks of a lot of use!) My only wish is that it was able to rock and that the blanket stayed up better.. Will is able to kick it off without any trouble. The cover is easily removed for washing which is helpful. Overall, a very comfy chair for our little one. Wish they had one big enough for this tired mom!
B00A0FGN8I|5|Great car seat ready to install base.  Heavy duty comes with weighing heavy. Rated by www.lifehiccups.com
B0049U5UF2|1|Terribly made. Cheap wood.
B00IHDB6UU|1|Not as big as I thought it was going to be. I need some just a little bigger.
B0064JFCD6|2|It looks nice but thats as far as it goes in my opinion.  It's way to long to be practical.  Its next to impossible to keep it from touching the ground.  Seriously just get a quick carrier or for goodness sakes put your kid down.. they can cry you know. Strollers are awesome you know.. and have storage.. who'd a thunk it.  These things are for the birds.  Oh and if your a plus size woman.. even the longer ones can only tie behind your back leaving a huge knot digging in..
B0009RNXNA|5|Great purchase. protects the car seat from being thrown all over while in the airport. My sons car seat is still intact
B0000D9SRG|1|This tub looked like it would work great, but I was disappointed with it very quickly. The shower and reservoir are very cheap. The spray from the shower was a little too weak for my liking. It requires 4 AA batteries that are encased in the cheap plastic lid of the reservoir, which doesn't look safe to me. The tub is also too short for my son. He kept sliding down the mesh holder and his legs were right up against the reservoir, kicking it and looking very uncomfortable. He normally likes a bath, but every time I've used this tub, he's cried and fussed.
B0011URFRE|3|Good seat but there are other brands with easier strapping systems. I bought the Brittax brand 3-in-1 for my second seat and like it much better
B0026PJ940|5|Everything is within easy reach in the multipockets of the Skip Hop Duo Deluxe Double. It was recommended by another twin mom, but I was skeptical that it was worth the price, until I saw it in person. I knew from the size, shape, and configuration of the pockets that it would be a great diaper bag. Now that I've been using it for a few months, I have to say that I like it even better than I thought I would. It is the best diaper bag ever for a parent of multiples.
B004S8MGGQ|5|Buy this one not the other brand (you know the big company that starts with a &#34;M&#34;) this one is soooooo much better because it is so adjustable! LOVE IT!!!
B000058CC7|5|Personally, I dreaded shopping for a baby gate. We have heard and experienced so many horror stories. We finally sucked it up and basically picked this one for the foot pedal alone. It has been a dream all the way around.     It took about ten minutes to install, only because I was a dunce and was trying to make it more difficult than it was. Hold the gate up, screw the spacers out evenly, done!     It has held up well -- very solidly constructed -- and it's so easy to use. No headaches trying to get through the gate, even when my hands are full. It keeps the dogs out and him in. So far he hasn't figured out how to open it, but even if he did I don't think he would be strong/heavy enough to push the pedal down (it takes a good amount of stepping power).     We are thrilled with this purchase and recommend it highly.
B000F78UAU|4|This item is a great buy and you will be hard pressed to find better quality for your money.  We tried out several chairs at the big box stores and most of the $300-$400 chairs were not as good quality wise. As always, hats off to Amazon for having the best price and free shipping.  I read lots of reviews on this item before purchasing it.  Many people seemed to complain about the seat cushion, which I must admit leaves something to be desired.  If you plan to spend a lot of time in this chair an extra cushion would definitely make it more comfortable.  Overall I was impressed with the construction of this item. There was virtually no assembly required.  This chair went together in a matter of minutes.  I would buy this one again.
B00AHQ03BS|5|it is very good
B002J4U8NY|1|Completely not happy about this product. It is not what is pictured. I expected it to be the picture and it should be. False advertising instead I got goofy looking bugs and not one of them is even a bumble bee which is why I bought the thing in the first place.....
B0057EEC44|5|The best pacifiers for those middle of the night wake ups . they glow in the dark so they are easy to find.
B005DOS2EE|4|We have a very wide opening into our kitchen, and this works very well for that purpose. It's sturdy and looks good.<br /><br />Note that you will have to screw into the wall or improvise another method of connecting it.
B000MXQGT4|2|This seat is everything a new parent is looking for in a high chair: sturdily crafted, nice-looking, comfortably padded, lots of bells and whistles.  If you have an enormous, carpeted eating area, a baby that sits perfectly still when they eat, never spills food, and never wipes their messy hands anywhere, then this is absolutely the chair for you.  If you aren't in that possibly nonexistent demographic, then you should think twice.<br /><br />The chair's base is huge.  We have a full sized dining table and the chair's legs are so widely spaced that it doesn't fit under the end of the table.  Since it's ridiculously wide in the other direction, this means a huge amount of floor space taken up, making it an annoying obstacle to maneuver around.<br /><br />The wheels on the chair are practically zero-friction hard rubber.  Even \\"locked\\" the chair zips freely around on our wood floor.  If our daughter is rocking around in it during mealtimes, she can easily cause the chair to lurch around, creating a generally unsafe eating environment.<br /><br />The rocking around, which as far as I've seen most babies do pretty much nonstop, has an uglier hazard with this chair that fortunately we've only had mild run-ins with.  The shockingly dumb design decision was made to have the joint of the legs spaced just far enough from the chair that a baby's arm can get wedged in the space.  This happened to our daughter a couple times and scared her, but reading other reviews some babies have gotten seriously traumatized by it.<br /><br />Should also be aware that if your baby is a kicker, they'll need to wear shoes.  The bottom of the tray is riddled with plastic ridges, some of which end in pointy corners.  Our daughter's flailing feet have caught these regularly, sometimes to the point of causing her to cry out in pain and possibly causing small cuts a few times.<br /><br />All the above are really dumb design decisions that can be overcome by careful ownership.  I don't think a chair as expensive as this one should require extra work by the purchaser to make it usable, though.  And, more importantly, the following two problems cannot be overcome by careful ownership; they are glaring design flaws that you will have to live with if you get this chair.<br /><br />The seat pad is fabric that does not wipe clean easily.  We have to toss it in the wash very regularly if we don't want it covered in gunk, and it takes forever to dry so the chair is unusable for at least a couple meals.  Worse, the straps are totally unremovable and extremely difficult to clean, so I've spent extended periods trying to scrub yogurt or peanut butter out of them only to have them get gross the next meal.  The tray is also a major head scratcher.  The \\"dishwasher safe tray insert\\" is fundamentally a great idea, but for no apparent reason it doesn't actually cover the side facing the baby, only about 2/3rds of it.  So 95% of the time we use it, we end up having to clean the main part of the tray too because that has gotten filthy despite the insert.<br /><br />If you really just care about how it looks and how easy it is to fold, then by all means go for it.  If you want a well thought out, practically designed product that offers decent ease of use relative to its price, look elsewhere.
B000066BF4|5|Do you have this item available any more? I LOVE IT!!!! It's every little girl's dream to have a set like this. How extraordinary!! I want one of these for my little girl. Please reproduce or remanufacture these!
B00G8QPMDK|4|Very cute excellent photo prop!
B00DB5F114|5|Excited to use these was a really great deal compared to local store prices.
B00ARCE5HK|1|The 4-piece set is the set you want, not the bumper pad. Still love the rest of the bedding set though.<br /><br />My husband and I just took classes at the hospital and doctors no longer recommend bumper pads at ANY age. They say the pads are too much of a safety risk now. Specifically, doctors say there is too much risk of SIDS and the child becoming entangled and strangled in the bumper pads. (SIDS risk is due to the fact that the child could roll over at some point and breathe and rebreathe into the bumper pad.)<br /><br />The standards on cribs have been further modified over the years to have the rails closer together to avoid baby's arms and legs getting stuck between. Also, the new sleepsack products help prevent this too.<br /><br />You can also check [...] (American Academy of Pediatrics), do a search for bumper pads and see the same information. The article I found was published in 2011, with the bumper pad info under the Bedding section.<br /><br />Thought you should know the latest.
B003T2OJEY|5|From what I can tell this is a fine quality product, but it is only for the UPPAbaby Vista stroller, *not* the UPPAbaby Cruz. It doesn't say this in the item description so I wanted to make sure other people didn't make the same mistake I did.
B0027VSIHC|1|Did not fit my 4 month old's average sized head. This product is not appropriate for babies 3+ month of age despite the fact it says that babies 0 - 6 months old can use this product.
B002GF55G6|5|All of the items are exactly as they appear--I was nervous that it would look different, or cheap (I have the baby chair from the Fisher Price Zen Collection, and I can't tell the difference with them in the same room), but I am completely satisfied. I also ordered the Mobile and lamp shade, and they look great as well. Good buy, good price
B008J1QOI4|5|My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this toy. It is the go to toy when she cries. We make sure to have it everywhere we go. We even purchased a second one as a back up!
B0042D69WY|5|Fisher price products are great. Any problems customer service doesn't hesitate to solve the problem. This swing puts baby to sleep instantly an no batteries needed!
B00006H3D9|4|We received ours as a gift and have only been using it for a month.  We really like it and are considering getting another one for our other vehicle. The straps do twist, but it has never gotten me even slightly frustrated. I can't imagine any other seat would be better.  My daughter is 8 months and still rear facing and in that position it is nearly impossible to access the strap adjustment - not that I have needed to use it. When we turn it around I'm sure it will be great. It fits wonderfully in my Alero (4 door) with the help of the MIGHTY TIGHT SEAT BELT TIGHTENER. I love that thing. It's only about $15-$16 and really cranks that seat belt/LATCH belt tight. I'm only curious about the seat's safety as a booster.... I love the seat so far. Only a few minor things that cause me to give it 4 stars instead of 5.
B001YJ6VCM|1|Cheaply made.  Wish I'd kept the box so I could return it, so we ended up throwing this away.  The screen comes off easily.  The instructions are awful.  The buttons are too accessible for kids so my daughter would push them trying to get the lights to work and the whole thing would get messes up.  The numbers are way too small. The biggest problem is how cheaply made it is.  What a disappointment.
B000G0LF62|5|Great sleep sack!  This was perfect for my child who grew out of the sleep sack without feet but wasn't ready for a toddler bed yet.  Very warm and cozy.  She likes the freedom of having her feet out.
B00KCWQKV4|5|We love this pillow!  Love that it's organic and safe for our littles to sleep on.  It's the perfect size and great for travel!
B001KYZRLM|5|Daughter requested this purchase for quick trips with her baby. It came quickly, without problems, and at good savings. Everyone here when she opened it loved the fabric.
B00272BDI2|5|Beautiful item. Delivered on time.
B008DDPLEG|1|It's going back. The blue seat comes out WAY too easily, and curious little one (who is super excited to start sitting on the potty)  spent more time taking the thing out and inspecting it than actually sitting on it. Threw a tantrum when I tried encouraging sitting. Plus it looks and sounds too much like a toy, so a little too distracting.  I just don't have the time to deal--going with an insert and a step stool for the toilet--gonna keep it real.
B00ECKPV5S|5|Super SOFT!  I wish they made adult products this soft!  Suggest using  with a thicker changing pad.  Cheap one that came with changing table curls a little when this is put on.  It goes on like a fitted sheet.  Do plan on getting a more substantial changing pad with curved up edges just couldn't wait to start making the nursery look like a nursery.
B000S8O9ME|2|Judt so-so.  It has slipped off the wall a few times. I wouldn't buy again.
B00HPQTCWY|5|the material is great and the colour is nice
B0062BMLZ8|5|I chose this product because doesn't contain sugar. until now my baby reacts very good on it. I strongly encourage the use of this product. you have to  put it half hour in advance and shake well in room temperature formula or with 4 hours in advance (a lower quantity) but pays the effort comparatively with giving sugar to an infant.
B00XJOMW4G|5|Beautifully made washcloths, soft and they make for a perfect gift for a new Mom.  Am quite happy with this purchase and would purchase again as part of a baby gift.  I'd encourage any Mom looking for Washcloths to buy these.
B00I38XG16|5|very cool article !
B005AJQXTS|5|my hubby had no problem putting the crib together on his own pretty quickly. the dresser required a second person but no complications there either! pretty satisfied. now, if only we could get our newborn to love it as much as we do ;)
B005IWM8PU|5|Easy to set up, easy to clean and stores out of the way.
B008C0R684|3|Well, you bought a Graco Infant car seat, then you should have one base for each car. Just to make things easier..<br />But, if there is a next time for me, I'd not buy a Graco Infant Car Seat. The one I bought was made of velvet and my baby felt it was too warm.<br />And the Infant Car Seat is hard to click connect. I had one from a diferent brand before and it was much easier..
B00MRZIGXY|4|Found these cups at the last minute and I love them and so does my 16 month old daughter! She feels like such a big girl using them and they do not leak for the most part. Only time they really leak is when she leaves them tipped over on their side for a long period of time. Other than that, she loves them and they are very easy to use... she has no problem getting the liquid out! Great invention!
B00WHO5SW2|5|Very soft and cute. Was easy to wash. Fits toddler pillow
B00V2RKXD4|1|This is an updates review. I liked the bag and how it was set up. However after a month and a few days the strap clip broke and it had some stitching at the top began to pull within few day. I sent it back and recieved a replacement, right out of the box the canvas is ripped where it meets the stitching  on 2 places on the strap.
B00GSMTV36|5|LOVE this chair! I only wish we had it when our oldest was born 5 years ago! It's still great for him now and for our 2-year-old.<br /><br />It's super easy to flip, you can use it in either mode with the tray or without, and it can push right up to our table.<br /><br />Some of my favorite things: it has no cracks or crevices (nowhere for food to get stuck and super easy to clean), it has wheels (tilt the chair to use them - your child won't be able to move it, no worries!), and the tray slides on to attach via snaps on the back of the seat (so your kid can't get it off).<br /><br />Its stylish and super durable (solid wood and plastic) so it would definitely last those 6 years and through multiple kids. Highly recommend!
B00PS5QYKM|5|Just like I remembered!
B00HPD4V1Y|5|I have a nine month old and have been using these for about a month and they are amazing! I have friends that have older kids and are upset they never thought to have these (although they would be good for applesauce). My only complaint is that the cap isn't attached and when my little one wants food now I put the cap down and forget where that is. Maybe an add-on item? Just make sure to keep the cap on when filling just in case the food is too funny....
B0036EMNJI|5|If anyone is looking to buy this seat, I just bought it on diapers.com for $109 with free 1-2 day shipping. I almost didn't buy it because I thought the deal was too good to be true, but it actually was as good as it sounded. My car seat came in two days and I couldn't be happier. It's super cute! I hope this helps someone else save some money on this great seat.
B00AJHECI0|5|We love this. It works for our 6 month old growing-out -of-swaddling baby. The things that make it good for us, however, might be a deterrent to others.<br /><br />--She can still move her arms around quite a bit. This enables her to flip all over the place. Because the woombie is so flexible, however, we don't worry about her getting stuck and not being able to breathe. She can even prop herself up on her tummy or suck at her covered hands if she wants to.<br />--She is able to, somehow, flip the woombie 180 degrees in the night so the zipper is on backward. Again, the flexibility and the appropriate tightness (and lack thereof) of the neck hole mitigate this concern.<br /><br />Neither of these things detract from sleep, in her case. I also love that it's a zipper product instead of Velcro, and that it's a two way zipper. I change her diaper in this all the time.<br /><br />Since another reviewer did this, I will too; because different things work for different babies and this might give other parents some more insights and better able to discern which product might be right for them:<br /><br />--Newborn woombie: 5/5 stars. This is what we ultimately ended up switching to. I liked it for many of the same reasons as the woombie air, though I'd say it was quite a bit less flexible.<br /><br />--Comfort and harmony convertible peanut: 2/5 stars. She busts out of the snaps and, since the neck hole is a bit looser and less elastic...she woke up with her arm out of the neck hole too.<br /><br />--Miracle blanket: 1/5 stars. For us this was a royal pain. It was nearly impossible to get her wrapped tightly enough with so many rotations around her body--especially since, while she loves being swaddled, she hates being put in the swaddle. And this was too hot for her. And even though it had a leg pocket for diaper changes, it ended up being a hot unwrapped mess every time.<br /><br />--Swaddle blankets: 2/5 stars. Some people swear by regular flannel or muslin swaddle blankets. I could never get them tight enough so that they didn't unwrap with my hurricane baby without wrapping them too tightly around her legs and hips.<br /><br />--Halo sleep sack (swaddler), fleece: 3/5 stars. This was great, but way too hot...even in the Minnesota winter. The Velcro was convenient on the arms, and the zip-up sack was great for diaper changes.<br /><br />--Halo sleep sack (swaddler), light weight: 4/5 stars. The baby fell asleep fastest in this for the longest time...but she would wake herself up getting her arms out of the swaddle, pushed up all directions. The Velcro was convenient and strong and I loved the zip from bottom zipper on the sack.<br /><br />--Swaddle Me wraps: 2/5 stars. These were the best for a very, very short period of time. She learned very quickly how to bust out of the Velcro and would wake up with arms all over. Even though you're supposed to be able to diaper change without unvelcroing, I found this very challenging. And the Velcro is loud and snags everything (including mom during nursing).<br /><br />--Zippadee zip: 3/5 stars. This is supposed to be a swaddle transition product. She likes being in them fine, but they certainly aren't a substitute for a swaddle. Not even close.kets.

B00ICOTIHC|5|Have you been looking for &#34;the one&#34; perfect diaper bag that will fit a lot of your baby's needs in it? Well you came to the right review, because you will learn all about Okie Dog's diaper bag I received. Use the promo code: 9880 which is good until August 31 for 20% off at Okie Dog.<br /><br />First off, let me tell you how great this company known as Okie Dog is. They have such an amazing variety of diaper bags, luxe, and kids bags to choose from so it was hard for me to choose just which one I wanted to get for review. I have a lot of friends who have babies or are pregnant and I wasn't sure if I was going to keep it as a on the go bag for my kids and I or let my good friend have it who has a 3 month old and 2 other kids. She will be getting it by August, but for now I have it. Look at the beautiful detail that this bag offers. I absolutely love the colors and design this metro messenger diaper bag in petrol blue design and color.<br /><br />As you can see, it has plenty of room to store things for your baby's needs as you go places, such as bottles on the side pouches on the outside of the diaper bag, a changing pad in the one pouch, a little bag to store odds and ends, a convenient belt to carry the bag on your shoulder, and snaps inside of the diaper bag. As you can see below, it comes with extras for the diaper bag. This bag is made of polyester.<br /><br />It comes with a small and compact changing pad which makes for easy and convenient changing time when you're out and about and you have to change your little one. I love diaper bags that have those. It saves so much time and you don't have to worry about germs. You can use either side of the changing pad, and the smooth side which is the white shown here can easily be wiped off with a damp rag or a baby wipe to sanitize for use.<br /><br />To show you how much room is in this awesome diaper bag, I put about 8 cloth diapers in there, and it also zipped pretty easily with all of them nicely stacked in there, and I placed it in my dresser drawer just to show you the size of it and the side when it's closed. The price of this diaper bag is $64.95 on their website, but is very well worth it and is well made. The dimensions of this bag are 18.9&#34; x 11.8&#34; x 6.7&#34;. It's also very sturdy which is one thing I love.n there, and I placed it in my dresser drawer just to show you the size of it and the side when it's closed.

B000U5FOT2|5|This system is much more sturdy than the usual plastic play yard.  It's about 4\\" taller too, which is great since my one year old son likes to chew on everything!  Highly recommended.  Make sure to get the extension though. I find the play yards to be a bit confining.  Note that this yard comes with a spring loaded gate.  It's sturdy and works well but is very narrow!  A tight squeeze getting out of this one.  Still, it's great that a gate is included (the plastic ones don't include one, and the ones you can buy are pretty flimsy).<br /><br />Please note that I also own the plastic one with the gate extension.  Pretty good, but I wish I'd purchased the metal one instead.
B001OC5UMQ|1|I cant screw in the caps because i don't want to ruin the wall. and the rubber end start to come apart
B00GUN3Z1W|5|Bought these to keep puppies out of rooms and not have close doors while they are training.  Can't beat the price and they work perfect.  High enough to keep the dogs in but low enough to step over when needed.
B000MM2NEM|5|I love this pillow and have had a great experience with it.  My first pregnancy pillow try was a snoogle, very firm and u-shaped.  I had an awful time with it and returned it.  I wish I had started with this pillow! I am seven months along and have had it for two months.  I am five nine, and it is long enough for me (the snoogle was not).  It's definitely not as firm or stuffed as the snoogle, but that ended up being a good thing to me.  It's not overly hot, the cover is much higher in quality (not the scratchy, polyester feel the snoogle cover had), and is more manageable.  If the snoogle had worked for me, it would have been worth the fact that it was so big it was like another person in the bed.  This pillow is works really well, is easy to move with as I roll over (I barely wake up now to roll over), isn't too hot or stuffy, yet provides the support I need.
B00451B0WW|5|My children are grown and I miss the &#34;little kids&#34; at Christmas!  I scanned and printed old photos of their childhood Christmases and enjoy this timeline photo album so much.  It brings back many Merry Christmas memories!
B0002JETOM|5|Ordered five of these to save the oriental rugs and the bedroom carpet downstairs.  The new Yorkie pup has been stopped from committing the floor crimes.They are sturdy enough to withstand the pounding of paws and scratching of claws (cat) from entering into the danger zones.  I placed one on top of the other... double high to keep the cat out.  Now, on with the potty training,,, who will be the most stubborn the pup or I?
B000BOKAKA|4|This exersaucer is easy to use, safe, and fun for babies.  Similar products may have additional activities, but I thought this one was great for how little I paid for it.  Also, we now have it out in the yard.  It takes the weather with no problems and dries quickly.
B004MWJP62|4|This cup made the transition to in from bottle to sippy cup incredibly easy! Our son loves it and now k ows thay it js his &#34;milk cup&#34;.The only downfall is you do have to open the spout a little, otherwise it's very hard to drink from.
B001OC5UNK|5|Sturdy and effective. Just what we needed for the grandkids visits!
B000YDDF6O|5|This is a really nifty toy to stick in the diaper bag or purse to keep the kiddo content while needing her to.... Well, be content... Works like a charm!!!
B000088KGZ|5|The infant thermometer I had was given to me and took my entire life of America to read a temp. So i bought this one, and this thermometer is fast enough that it gives me a reading before my impatient child yanks it out from under her arm.
B0000TYHD2|5|This pump is simple, efficient and less expensive. I like it so much that I bought a back-up one of the exact same model.    I like the drop-ins system of transferring breastmilk to bottles.     I have only tried a Medela pump in addition to this one, and I didn't like it because of it's initial complexity. This pump is sooo easy to just throw it together and get pumping.     My one complaint is that there is an area that is hard to clean in the 4 piece nipple apparatus. You need a pipe cleaner to really get it (unless I'm missing something.)
B0139KJYWM|5|This bag is nice and neat I plan on using it mainly for traveling. The big pocket inside is great to stock up with a few sets of baby clothing (you know we can never predict what they are going to do when) it is also roomy enough for a blanket and a jacket for baby.
B0002ZOI9W|2|I have a 8 month old son and he likes it for about 5 mins at a time and today as we were sitting there with him he tried ti clinb out and the whole thing with him in it fell over backwards and he slid out of the strap how he did it we dont know But beware when you buy thid it only work untill youre kids are 3 months and then you have to put it away untill they can get into it and out of it with out getting hurt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that is why I rated it a 2 because it scared me half to death and him to
B002MXP3SM|5|These are some amazing hooks that don't budge, carry a ton of weight and look stylish too.  I like putting my diaper bag on it so I have easy access rather than reach down into the carriage.  Worth every penny.
B00171WXII|5|The Nosefrida snotsucker does one thing and it does it really, really well. I cant say enough good things about this product.  I came across the nosefrida by chance when I was watching a video about how to use a bulb syringe to clear mucous from my baby's nose.  The video was on babycentre's website and after the paediatrician Dr. Vo demonstrated how to use the bulb syringe she also demonstrated another nasal aspirator, she did not give the name, but I loved how it worked and I came to amazon's website and I did some research and lo and behold I found the Nosefrida nasal aspirator, I read some of the reviews and I decided to order it. I am not sorry, this thing works miracles. It is the first product that I have bought that actually does what it says it will do. This is a must buy for new parents and parents who already have kids who cannot blow their noses. The best money I ever spent. And let me say again it really, really works. My baby girl does not love it but she hated the bulb syringe and at least this gets the job done.
B00PXEWKZ6|5|I got these Baby swaddle blankets at a discount to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  I got them for my niece's shower this weekend.  I tell you what she is going to be so impressed.  I know I was.  They come in a beautiful box with instructions on the back how to swaddle your baby.  She will need to know that as she is going to be a new mom for the first time.  inside the box is 5 blankets.  They are pretty neutral colors which are always good to give at a shower.  They are a large size 47 x 47 inches and light.  They are very soft from the bamboo.with a 1,500 thread count.  They will definitely keep the baby warm and dry.  There are so many uses for them.  She can use them as a burp cloth, to cover her and baby while breast feeding, over the car seat, grocery cart or just a blanket.  These blankets really rank high as to one of the nicest products I have ever reviewed.  I absolutely love them.
B00D04R2L8|5|Great seat, fits my Volvo S40 very good.
B00EMSWBL2|5|This chair is perfect to take on the go!!
B00GSX1XEU|5|After spending hours of trying to find the perfect walker because of reviews complaining about the back wheels not rotating 360 degrees,  I gave up and bought the cheapest and cutest one of the bunch.  My baby absolutely loves this walker, he has no trouble maneuvering and he loves the mobility and independence!  This walker is also very attractive, the vibrant colors are beautiful.
B00B7M7CL0|4|Restaurant height chairs are usually nasty/dirty/gross.  This gives you a barrier between the nasty and the baby/toddler.  Packs down to tiny.  Toy loops are great too.
B000Z4MJZK|5|I love this album - already loaded with pictures. Good quality too. I'll buy more of these soon, I'm sure.
B002181DDW|1|I was so excited to see a kit that had 27mm SoftFit breastshields.  Too bad it wasn't true!  They are 24mm - like all the others
B00G8STL5S|1|The hangings just fell off within few days I wouldn't recommend this. It's big for my baby and appropriate for kids over 5 years
B000V749X6|4|I am using this product to transport injectables that must be chilled, rather than for it's intended purpose.  It is well made, perfectly sized, and very effective at maintaining a cold temperature for extended periods of time.  Could not ask for more!
B00GULAQ4S|4|This is a nice bed just seems a little flimsy.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|These are easy to apply and have held so far.  I did let them stick overnight to be sure of a good hold
B00004NKKE|2|An OK toy, but interest in it wore off fast.  I think a regular top would hold interest longer.
B00E7B20RO|5|I was skeptical about how well this product would actually work but I have been very pleased. Summers in Oklahoma are very hot and humid and I was worried about my grandson overheating in his rear facing car seat. The Noggle works beautifully and I'm sure it will work just as well to provide heat when the weather is cold.. I have used the product for about two weeks in temperatures in the high 90's with heat index well over 100 degrees. I highly recommend this product.
B007EV5ME2|3|The wall decals that we bought for my daughter's room were awesome. They gave you images on the packaging for suggestions on how to organize the decals to make a cool little mural. These, on the other hand, were just as they are on here, which is fine. They are as described/pictured. However, there are no images anywhere to help with placement to make it look cool. So, if you're someone like me who can't visual without placing, then you'll have to do what I did--I cut all the images apart first, and then I put them up on the wall with painter's tape first to see where I wanted them. They still looked different as the backing is white, but it was for the better since without it, they are more transparent.<br />The main PROBLEM that I had with these is that the &#34;waves&#34; don't  line up, so if you put them on the wall together, you basically have crooked waves. That's the reason why we didn't even use them. I would have liked to have been able to use them. Oh well!
B005VNWSP6|1|This product is not what I expected. Some pieces were missing out of the box and the product was poorly made as far as quality.
B004GJXM3I|5|I am having twins and didn't want to spend too much on matching bumper pads & crib bedding.  This was a great price and I'm so impressed with the colors in person.  I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and would definitely recommend something like this to anyone else.  I think the twins will love looking at the animals & flowers inside their cribs!
B00D4LFDYA|2|I love the diaper bag it's durable but I am very disappointed that I spent the money and the first day I had it the wet wipe container broke... I didn't even have the bag 24 hours before it broke.  Just sucks to spend a good chunk of change for it to break
B00OLRKH9C|5|The most amazing and safe car seat. Attractive. Lasts thru many stages. Ease of installation. Instructions online. Great construction. 5 stars. U cannot find any thing better.
B0029LH1ZK|5|We got this cause of how it went down in the from hoping it would be easy for me to get in, because I am not a very tall person. Well it is more perfect then I would have thought. Even if the front didn't bow down you would be about to get into it without any trouble. Would suggest this to any mom needing a convertible crib. It was very affordable and the wood looks wonderful! VERY PLEASED!
B0031RFMDO|5|I searched and searched for the best high chair for my daughter and this is the one I decided on. She is 4 now and I'm giving it to my brother who is expecting his first child. When I was looking  for information to send him about it I noticed some bad reviews so I thought I would chime in and say that I have nothing but good things to say about this product. It was always easy to clean, easy to move around the kitchen, and comfortable for my daughter. The flat vs curved back made it much easier for her to move her arms up and down and all around so that she could feed herself and play with little toys. The bar that goes across underneath the tray is something I liked as an added safety feature. If there was a big mess I could take the tray off and wipe it down while my daughter remained in the chair. The bar made it real hard for her to get up and jump out. One review said something about needing more padding on the sides because the baby was falling off to the side. I didn't see much point in using any high chair until my daughter was old enough to sit on her own and eat baby food vs a bottle so I don't see it as an issue.
B00007L5WV|5|My daughter lived in these between 3 and 8 months. They're great for when your baby no longer wants to be swaddled but still needs extra warmth without the bulk of blankets.
B009Z4WJFQ|5|I'm thinking the first person to review here has never had a \\"bundle me\\" product. All the zippers on all the bundle me products start as two zippers from the bottom that go up the sides. What I think the past poster doesn't understand is that you don't have to \\"unhinge\\" the zippers to get the baby in and out. All that you need to do is unzip each side a decent amount, and fold back the top layer. Put your babe back in, zip back up. This isn't at all time consuming.<br /><br />As for the space between the zippers on the bottom - again, this is true of any bundle me product. It isn't a gaping hole, and when my baby sits in there she is nothing but warm and toasty.<br /><br />This particular bundle me is new to the market, from what I can see, and it's great. It has the lining like the urban bundle me collection, but with MUCH more warmth. It has a hood should you want to really pick up the warmth factor, an extendable foot area so it can grow with your baby well into toddlerhood... Really helpful for living in colder weather climates. No complaints here.
B004BKJFJM|5|It's so feminine, light weight, fits into whatever I need to put it in. I think it's adorable!!! Those who see it ask where did I find it.....Amazon, I answer! I own a larger one, it's a soft pink with jungle animals in a brown and cream print, I use it as a toiletry case...P.S. I will be buying others, there's so many beautiful patterns to choose from.
B004T8NLU0|3|There are many things I like about this cup; The spout is durable, the handles are perfect size for my daughter and the valve is easy to clean. However in the past week all 3 of our cups have started to leak. Upon closer inspection I found cracks and even missing pieces in the threading on the cup which I believe are the source of the leaking.  I'm very disappointed that the cup itself is not as durable as the spout.
B000HK6BCE|5|No issues to report!  Great for my three year olds bed!  He loves it too!  I think it makes him feel secure!  No issues with changing the sheets or anything like that.  It does take two to install though!
B002MN3JY2|5|I have what I call a &#34;normal&#34; flow which just means I rarely leak milk. I have known women who leak all the time and that is not me. With that said, this product worked great for me. I love that they are washable and I washed them with the baby clothes so the soft detergent wouldn't irritate my nipples. Would buy them again.
B00589SZL4|5|My family and I have used this product (and also its red-top container for non-skin surfaces) for several years. It's a little hard to find sometimes but worth looking for because it is a superior product for sanitizing hands to other products - mainly because it is alcohol based, a safe, broad-spectrum sanitizer; it's gentle on the skin and is very effective, per scientific data on alcohol for such purposes. This is a large 'tub' and lasts a long time depending on your frequency of use. Has only the light and very short-lived scent of rubbing alcohol and the scent does not linger on the skin. Does not dry out skin, per our use anyway.
B000WGZH0K|5|I got this cover to guard our baby against the cold wind. We live near a mountain corridor and there is lots of gusts during the day. I ended up loving the cover for another unexpected benefits. I can use the cover to place a cover to protect our baby from the sun. Also, when I take her to the mall, I can keep the cover, one to keep the noise out and second it gives me some level of comfort from sick people breathing on her. Ever since I got the cover, I never took it off and use it rain or shine.
B005JDOYF0|4|we bought this so we can take flights without lugging our usual stroller. This works great. It's light, folds easily. It definitely isn't as compact as umbrella strollers. The basket underneath is big and can hold quite an amount. It's really easy to maneuver with one hand. One thing I didn't like was the awkward angle when I tried to lean over the handle bar to reach my baby. Maybe it works better for someone taller.
B0031QPNGQ|5|I ordered in white and yellow gingham and the color is perfect. This chair is so comfortable,  I love it. If I  had more room I'd order another one.
B002XMRGMS|5|I used this booster seat on our vacation and it was great. My 2 year old is used to eating in her high chair and this was the closest to it. Without it she is up and down and all over the place. This chair is wonderful. It keeps busy toddlers in their seats and safe while eating outside of your home.
B0011ECP9S|5|This items is great for pumping on the go!  It is a must have work mobile moms who are good at multitasking.
B00EKNSVB8|2|Take this with a grain of salt, as I do not own another umbrella stroller, but color me unimpressed.  First off, one of the velcro straps from the canopy is missing so it doesn't hang right (trying to get a replacement from Joovy).  Second, I've noticed one of the wheels almost never turns and it seems the axle is slightly askew.  I didn't find it suitable for sidewalks or paved outdoor paths (too bumpy) only maybe mall strolling.  Overall pretty disappointed, wish I'd gotten something cheaper.
B006Z2BZBU|4|We use this in our Graco playpen and it fits perfectly. It's a very firm mattress. Even though it's waterproof, I still use a padded waterproof mattress pad just to give a tad bit of softness under the fitted crib sheet.
B001FB567U|1|I have been using this monitor for 12 months now. The first few months it worked ok. But now the picture is always going out and it doesn't hold charge like it used to. I have also noticed it doesn't even pick up sound right away. Sometimes i'll hear my daughter before the monitor even kicks on. Also the handset loses the camera signal constantly. I'm expecting again and we are already looking for a new monitor. This one is definatly not dependable enough for a newborn.
B001F6WJ7K|5|Love how the car seat snaps into the stroller to make it easy to tote my little one around without having to take her out of the car seat. Works great on all kinds of terrain.  We visited a Camp for a fundraiser and had no problems pushing it around on the hills and paths. Size wise it is middle of the line, it is pretty big for a few circumstances but tends to fit almost anywhere. Love that even when I'm done with the car seat the stroller will still fit her for quite a while. My kid is pretty tall and may or may not grow out of the height maximum before she is 1 but I worry a lot less since this one is rated for bigger sizes (up to 30 inches or 30 pounds). Worth the money!
B001TV03PQ|5|This dresser arrived promptly and was delivered assembled which is a huge plus.  It is a quality piece of furniture.  The finish was perfect. The drawers slide easily.  Perfect for my granddaughter's room.
B007OQP6A2|5|For the money, this is a very good car seat. The pattern is cute and it's easy to adjust the tightness of the straps. It's not a fancy model but works great for those of us not wanting to spend $300 on a carseat.
B003ATEXYM|5|This weather shield is worth every penny! I don't have to worry about the sun getting in my son's eyes or the wind being too cold with this weather shield.  Easy on and off. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys running or walking with their little one.
B002C1AX20|3|These are OK, probably the best option I have seen on the market. The problem is that the stickers that come with the dividers do not have the correct options for baby clothes sizing... If you don't care about that, go for it.
B00K0SCI3E|4|Works well, and definitely puts your mind at ease when you don't feel the baby as regularly. Only complaint is doesn't always register heart rate correctly or takes a while to register, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.
B004HO5866|5|I've been waiting for this pram to arrive and I wasn't disappointed!  Ran my fingers through all the plastic portions and there are no sharp / unfinished edges that might cut my 18 month old.  The material is easy to wash (yes I spilt a little tea over the hood on the first day of use but that came off with some wet wipes.  The basket wasn't quite big enough for my diaper bag but no issue with that as my diaper bag is the one that probably needs some downsizing.  Baby was comfortable in it and likes the see-through window over the top of the hood.  Friends have been commenting that it looks way more expensive than it really is.  Most of all, I'm happy to have gotten a good umbrella stroller that is not flimsy and poorly made.. there's even suspension over the front wheels! I'll be able to get a lot of mileage from this pram as there's still plenty of room for my baby.  Without a doubt, best buy for me this season, and way more convenient than my Quinny.
B003YY698G|5|It is fantastic!Huge and very soft.The stuffing needed to be spread out a bit which was easy to do, other than that it was great!
B005JN6304|3|The gate is good quality and will probably work for most people, but it just didn't work for us. Because of the way that the clamps are configured to hold the gate a specific width, it's not really that adjustable. It just so happens that our stairway width is right between two of the stops and no matter how much we screw out (or in) the adjustable screws, it just won't fit.
B00FFB0ZZY|5|I loved
B00008ZCGH|5|My daughter got these blocks for Christmas when she was only a month old. At first, we would take her hand and let her feel the many different textures that each block has and on each side of the block. We would squuze the duck for her and pull the frog's leg for her too. Now, she is 9 1/2 months old, and we placed them in her crib, so when she wakes up from a nap or in the morning after being asleep all night, she has a toy that she loves to keep her occupied before I get in there to her, and they are safe enough (not too plush) to where I know they won't suffocate her. These are really good toys, and I just recently told my husband we needed to get her the set with the Penguin!
B0000DEW8N|5|We have a full-size highchair at home (Peg Perego Prima Pappa) that we love--but this booster is fantastic for when we visit family or for when we have an extra child at our house at mealtime.  Although we still use our full-size highchair on a daily basis, it isn't really necessary now that our child is a toddler...a toddler really could use this booster as her only chair.   <br /> <br />We never have found a chair we can't strap this booster on to and it always has been very sturdy.  The harness straps are adjustable and the tray has three different settings to accomodate a variety of tummy sizes.  My 33lb 37inch child still fits comfortably into this seat. <br /> <br />We have used the chair outside to keep our daughter contained during a picnic, but it really isn't designed for that use--we had to be very careful that she didn't push off with her legs and tip the chair backward. <br /> <br />We bring the chair with us when we visit relatives, but this would be something great for grandparents to purchase to keep at their house.
B003WKZ4Y2|4|This sound machine has been a real life-saver at that 3 p.m. stretch before Husband gets home to help with Baby, or around a 3 a.m. feeding when Baby does not want to go back to sleep. We use the same soothing sound every time - the first \\"white noise\\" setting - and Baby LOVES it and obviously feels calmed enough to relax and usually sleep. Another great thing about this sound machine is that its volume goes way up. I've seen reviews for other machines that say that they don't go very loud at all, and this one has such a high volume that we don't even use the loudest setting. Of course as with any baby, it doesn't work EVERY time - if there was a perfect fix, everyone would use it! - but it does work often enough for us to feel like it was a great investment at under $30. I didn't realize when I bought it that there was an upgraded model that has an AV input (iPod, phone) for just a few bucks more; if I'd known, I would have gotten that one.
B00BQYVQWU|5|Excellent product and inexpensive. I use it everyday.
B0038JDLVU|4|its not like the swaddles i have where they are more like a  onesie that zips  but overall it does what its supposed too
B001NIFNTG|4|This is a great versatile carrier that can be used like a sling, baby bjorn, and front pack carrier.  I think sizing up from their recommendations might be a good idea for some.  I purchased the xtra-small based on the chart and it feels very snug and since I'm using this for a foster baby, I don't have any extra weight or enlarged breasts to contend with.  Overall, I still like the Ergo best for general ease and comfort, but with all the extra holds that can be done with this carrier, it's a good compliment.
B00BG1VYZM|5|Very good product!!!!!
B002NUWQUM|2|I have been through two of these already and the zipper is totally worthless. For $30+ for a piece of spandex with holes you think they could put a quality zipper on the product. That being said, I gave it two stars because it really is handy for pumping at work.
B004G8QSYO|5|recibi el producto segun las indicaciones.. estoy muy satisfecha cumplio con las espectativas.. vendedor recomendado y se entrego en el plazo previsto
B003DML8W6|4|They are great. Wish the opening were a little bigger to use with yogurt pops. But my kids love them.
B005GDW34C|3|I have heard nothing but praises for these training pants! And I am sure they are all wonderful as my friends have boasted about so I added them to my registry! I received the small and I am not quite sure that the small will fit my teeny daughter when she needs to wear them as they were very big looking. So I returned them. I wish they made an even smaller size for the little children learning to go!
B004HWXCJS|5|I have used Medela PiSA daily for three months now, exclusively for two + months, and have never experienced any problems with it. It removes milk efficiently, is easy to use and clean, and comes with great accessories for those moms who pump at work. Its only caveat is that it is noisy, but that doesn't bother me personally. I paid $80 to rent the hospital grade machine, Symphony, and it didn't remove milk any better, which is the bottom line. Definitely purchase from Amazon, they have the best price (which is normally the case.) And do consider buying an extra set of tubing, because they will get dirty and you want to have a backup when one set is drying.
B000S8O9ME|1|Doesn't work!!! You have to have the kind of tile as shown on the picture otherwise it won't stick!!!!
B00INKJ6YU|5|Awesome product. Fit my little toddler just right.<br />Packaging was great and holds everything he needs.<br />It uses a nylon material
B00WUBQUN8|5|i love this diaper bag. i usually use a regular side diaper bag for every day use but i bought this bc we went on vacation overseas for a month. it was very useful and kept everything organized. the carry straps are super soft and supportive. the front is AWESOME bc it has a built in changing pad which i personally have never seen before and has a side pocket with easy to access wipes ! so innovative ! i actually didn't use the side pocket access for the wipes i guess i was just used to taking the whole thing out lol. i love that the other side has an insulated lining pocket to store a bottle or juice ! also the print on the front is &#34;burberry&#34;- like which i thought was very chic ! i wanted something cute but not designer so that just in case if it got lost or damaged along our travels i wouldn't get so upset. i was only going to use it temporarily but i think it will replace my every day bag once we get home !!!!! thanks for such an amazing diaper back pack !!!
B004DCA22M|5|These are my son's blankies and he LOVES the textures. BEST products made by aden + anais. Wouldn't think twice about purchasing more!
B00EYDTTHE|5|Very nice bibs. Wish they came in shades of pink and purple. One bib lasts all day. Love the box
B00VGRLHB2|2|I really wanted to like this item, but it broke the first time we used it.  We were able to rig it so that it lasted for our week at the beach, but not sure it will be able to be used again.  The plastic arms are very cheaply constructed.  I love the pop n play playard, just wish this shade portion was more reliable.
B00318CLAK|5|I returned our second seat for the city select because we just use this. Our 2yo doesn't want to sit still when we're out but it's perfect to keep her wrangled in but still let her run loose without having to unbuckle her. It's such a perfect accessory and a brilliant idea.
B00834D5SO|5|We initially had an infant carrier from Britax.  It always seemed very sturdy.  As our child was outgrowing the infant carrier, we purchased two of these (one for each car).  I can safely say that this is a huge upgrade and I am glad that we chose this car seat.  My child was crying every time we put him in the infant carrier and now he doesn't make a peep in this car seat.  With it rear facing, it is somewhat difficult for my wife to get our child in the car seat in her legacy.  I have an Accord and have no issues.  It is a large seat, but I have more room behind the driver seat than I did with the infant carrier, so while large, it doesn't interfere with the front seat.  I would highly recommend this - great build quality, very comfortable for my son, and extremely easy to install (although we chose not to use the tether system with the seat rear facing as the logistics of the tether being behind the head rest made this impossible).
B002WONXU6|5|we bought this for our twins because its beautiful. it became the best money we spent on them because they ended up being 34w preemies and in order to feed them simultaneously and successfully, we had to use these bouncers to position them upright for feeds. they had/have reflux and if they were too reclined, they'd turn into vomitous milk fountains. no bells and whistles on this, but that's ok. we put our own toys on. at 14m they still use this every day because they can climb in and out on their own. i can't recommend this enough. we owned a combi pod bouncer as well, and it was nice but it was sold long ago because it was not as useful.
B00014PLAO|1|This didn't even stick after 24 hours of application. Ended up in the trash. Don't waste your money on this.
B000RFG066|5|These are truly the ONLY sippy cups we have found (and we've used lots!!) that never leak!!  Love them!
B006ZVV0NO|4|I have no complaints about this product.  It's nothing special, but works just fine.  I would buy the product again
B0041EWFOK|5|How can you go wrong with muslin blankets. This is my second set and the ones I used for child number one are in great shape for child number three. They a great for swaddling as the fabric is textured just enough to hold tight.
B0035ER5EW|1|I loved this for my 8 month old a couple months ago when we bought it, she loves sesame street and especially Elmo. She loved it. She chewed on it all the time and then I noticed white paint chips in her mouth from Elmo's eyes, NOT OKAY! I took it away and plan to bring it back and complain at the store as well, DO NOT GIVE TO A BABY, very disappointed.
B00768MEJO|5|Must have
B001PBFWMO|5|I love it! When i play the music. My baby gets so quiet so its easy to use. At this point my baby even likes it. Got him on video actually making me clean his nose. So cute.
B0031W38YO|5|I can't say enough positive things about this Monkey!! We have two of them. My son LOVES LOVES LOVES his monkey.
B000LPDBPK|2|The Box for this seat is by no means strong enough to handle the abuse they get in transit. You will end up with damaged product.  I order this chair for our 1 year old, and on first attempt box arrived half open with missing part (Cup Holder).  After calling customer support they sent me a 2nd chair, once more the box was damaged, and the fabric of the chair was torn.  I end up returning both chairs, and buying it form a store!
B00C01FDRC|1|Not worth ordering....super soft bit along SUPER SUPER TINY DOESN'T EVEN COVER MY 6MO OLD!!!
B0038OLMXO|5|I bought this to go around our woodstove to keep our kids away. It works wonderful!! It has been about two years now and it still works perfectly and looks great!
B000F78UAU|4|It is obviously not top of the line, but it looks nice and works nice. And the cost is fantastic. I understand the other reviews that are disappointed in its longevity and appearance. However, you get what you pay for. It likely will not be something to hand down to your grandchildren, but it is a nice chair that looks great in a nursery. And how long it lasts depends on how you use it and how you take care of it. Overall, Great Value.
B002LARFPK|2|These towels are nice & soft for baby, but they are really quite thin and small.  They size worked well for the first month or so when baby was tiny, but after that they were too small.  Being so thin, they don't keep baby very warm after getting out of the bath either.  I wouldn't really recommend them.
B007CRJHUI|5|This crib looks great! It gets the job done and is less expensive than other modern looking cribs out there. Couldn't be more pleased and we can use it for the toddler stage too!
B00C3MFDZK|5|i have bought from khols.com and have recommend to all my friends they have been buying up giggledots for the kids room , there website showed how it would look in the room plus i was able to mix and match for daughters and sons room
B000O3GCFU|5|Bought it as a gift and the wife loves it. Nice Colors and keeps it hot or cold for work or play
B0036ZBGUE|5|I got the celery color and very pleased with it.  Although this is NOT a blanket it is more of a receiving blanket. I got it for my puppy to use in his crate. I'm looking to buy these for a coming up baby shower.  High quality and so soft.
B001SIMT5M|5|At first I thought it was too big. But, after placing it on my daughter and putting her to bed I realized that's the point. It's supposed to be a blanket. She loves it and didn't wake up cold! I wish they make adult ones!!
B003I5X2YU|5|I tried all the brands available, and this one was the only one that was truly thin, the other ones were bulky and uncomfortable, and it was obvious I was wearing them. I recommend this but I would suggest you try a few brand before you settle because each body type is different and what worked for me may not work for you.
B00H8MSKAU|5|My husband said &#34;it's a beast!&#34; I feel better about my daughter being in this one after just recently being in a car accident. Happy mom!
B0001NE8OA|5|Our daughter is 7 months old now and we've just started solids. Boy, does here BM's small bad now! ha ha. But the Diaper Genie doesn't leave any smell. You walk into her room and wouldn't even know we keep her diaper can in there! The only thing that is a little confusing about it is after you empty it and put a knot in the bottom it's a little confusing on how to get it to start twisting again. But it only took us about a week to figure it out and after that it's GREAT! I tried the Neat diaper pale and Genie is far better.
B0014HOLFI|3|Lasts a while but gets tougher with each wash.  Lots of pills.  Sometimes the edges are hard.  I use this under bedding so the toughness doesn't really affect the baby.
B000JJK9EY|4|We like our Go-Go Babyz about 90% of the time. It's a great tool to have when traveling with little ones. We even got a second one now that our second child is older and we are taking the car seat with us on planes.  Everywhere we go, the GoGo Babyz gets attention as people marvel in what a great idea it is to wheel around your kids both for practicality of bringing the seat but also not lugging the stroller with us through the airport. Our only issue with this product is that we have had two wheels break on us already.  Customer service was good and replaced our first broken wheel (we haven't sent them a picture or complaint on the second one yet). However, this product should just automatically come with backup wheels for situations like this.  The two times we had issues with the wheels was on the return trip (at least) but also during a VERY bad part of our return journey to break on us. If it came with a back up wheel, I would recommend this to everyone I know with a small child.
B00005BYUR|5|These came highly recommended.  From his first experience w/ these bottles, our son has eaten well then burped loudly.  I need to credit Dr. Brown's bottles.
B001F50TPA|5|This is my main stroller-  Collapses to a decent size, has a good size basket, its great.  I did have to change diaper bags though for it to fit.  Not a big deal though, I just bought a vertical columbia diaper bag to fit inside the somewhat narrow frame of this stroller.  Anyways, if you do purchase this stroller consider using a head support of some kind if you have a smaller baby-  It's recommended for use 6 months and over, but my three month old does fine in it as long as it is positioned in the lowest setting and with a kiddapotamus baby positioner inside.  You'll like this stroller alot.
B00MVRW1UM|1|Very uncomfortable for my 2 year old who is 25 lbs.
B008OPPPX0|5|We keep books in this for the car, and the cup holders are fantastic!  They are sized for standard sippy-cups and water bottles.  Great for in between two boosters for our kids to keep their car activities.
B00000J4SP|2|After reading raving reviews about this gym, I decided that it was probably a good item, despite the high price for such an unsophisticated item. After getting it home, I was disappointed that it only came with three toys (add-ons are pricey) and that there was no practical way to adjust how low they hung for baby- they were either in his face or too high to see. I introduced my newborn to this activity gym repeatedly from birth to three months, hoping to entertain him with it at some point. At first, he was too little to see the arches and the toys. Then, he quickly became too active to just lay passively because he wanted to lean on the arches for support in standing. I think this mat would be far more entertaining if it had more toys and put them on an elastic or adjustible string. I also think if the mat had different textures and a more engaging musical toy, it might be more appealing to babies. I've seen other activity gyms that have those features, and wish I would've bought one of those instead of falling for the hype that newborns are attracted to black, white, and red as one of my main reasons for buying this gym.
B00005N9X5|5|This seat is wonderful! We bought it for our 1 1/2 year-old in preparation for Thanksgiving at a relative's house. Since then, we've used it countless times. It is small enough that we simply leave it under a seat in our van so we always have it if we need a booster seat. It has also come in handy for guests. It has always been very sturdy as long as both belts are correctly attached to a chair and tightened. The pockets do not lend themselves to storage but this has never been an issue for us. We highly recommend this product.
B004CLBX2M|5|This gate is well built, easy to install, and easy for adults (including my grandmother) to open and close.  I tried two other models (manufactures) and this one is better build than other models.  Strongly recommend spending the extra to get the 36\\" height (this model). Toddler can nudge and climb over shorter height models.
B004P1IWK0|3|Cute but quality not as expected, the rug was not packed or protected properly and I did notice slight black stains on one of the corner of the rug.
B005ODV22S|4|Love the idea of this and it performs as expected; keeps everything neat and tidy. I have NO IDEA why these cost 3x more in Canada. It is only worth the 25 bucks or so you will find these for the states.
B002DZDPC0|3|omg this thing is noisy. it works very well, once you get it lined up evenly.  take your time putting it in, and it will work great.
B003AJXY1U|5|We have about 7 of these size 1's in various colors and use them w/Osocozy prefolds, also size 1.<br /><br />^ Baby was 3 weeks old and roughly 8lbs and 21&#34; when we started using these. They fit him perfectly with the prefold trifolded newspaper style and the cover snapped as tightly as possible, plus with the shortest rise snapped.<br /><br />^ They also fit well with the prefold Snappi'd around him, but I was too lazy to do that when the first method worked so well for us.<br /><br />^ Now at 4 months, my son is 17lbs, 1oz, and 26&#34;.<br />^ We trifold the prefold inside still (long or short way).. We were getting leaks every night for a while until we tightened the waist and unsnapped the rise..<br />^^ Just know as your baby grows, it might take some trial and error before you hit the &#34;magic&#34; combination for your LO. :)<br /><br />^ The only leaks we've had have been from either incorrectly fitting the diaper on baby - and ONCE when he miraculously went thru the whole night without waking us up enough to change him haha.<br /><br />^ These will likely fit until our baby is past the 18lb point, just because of his build. :)
B0042D69V0|3|We bought this last week, and the thing only plays music when it wants to...must be a short in the wiring, Glad i didnt pay more.
B004DS14B4|1|I bought this to use with our 7 month old son. It was TERRIBLE! The lid doesn't stay on the product and it spilled more than once before I gave up and returned it. NOT worth it!
B0013FCBJO|5|Great product!  I buy it for all new moms!
B003B09YFS|4|I looked at a lot of butterfly patterns, but chose this one. Also found matching accessories for my daughters room. Love love love it.
B008FRMOZ4|3|Cute little lunch box for little girls. Worth the price from what I can see. Will know more after Dec as it is a Christmas gift.
B00F4O86C6|5|This is as cute as it can be.  I gave it as a Christmas gift for a relative.  He isn't old enough to say if he likes it, but his mom loved it!
B001H3KR5C|5|Buy it, just do it.  My little one loves this carrier, After reading many reviews, we went with the mesh because the other don't breath and make a sweaty situation for your baby. We had no moisture problems with this one.
B00P2RN1I4|3|Didn't work as well for my toddler as I hoped, would have been better for a school aged child, the band didn't go small enough for him and the water alarm would go off when he wasn't wet or near water which I had read other parents complain about. Overall, seems to be the best one on the market, based off of the reviews of others.
B000I2MRHO|5|My son likes playing with this cube in the car and probably will continue playing with it gleefully as he gets older (he is 4 months old, bought this when he was 2 months old).  I purchased this as a portable mirror with bonus when my son was first discovering how fun mirrors can be.  Since there are way more things on this cube than just the mirror, it has been a bonus toy in the car.  Definitely recommend.
B004FTQ9HA|1|We dont use it anymore.  I couldnt' get it to stick to the tub wall.  When it did it would fall... it didn't cover the full tub and i have a standard bathtub.  All in all, not a great use of my money :(  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B004HFQLOI|1|HATE IT! Waste of money... the recipe book sucks and this desen't get to the right temperature to make it properly pasteurize..so it stays sorta watery.
B000RFC3BM|5|These make perfect daycare containers...the right size, tightly fitting lids, easy to wash, and cheap enough not to fret if one falls into the inevitable daycare black-hole. I find myself even grabbing one to do other things like making honey masks and meat rubs. Love these!
B004GKM7TW|5|great product.  my baby (now 5 mo) seems comfortable with this on - he doesn't pull it off his face and the sun in his face bothers him less with these on.  would definitely recommend this product.
B004LE8TPO|5|This memory book is a LOT nicer than I expected, given the price I paid, and it's got gorgeous pages that can be removed or added to since they're all on a 3-ring binder. There are even extra clear plastic sleeves for pictures, baby shower cards, etc. that couldn't fit on the pages. I love it!!
B00HVB36NE|5|Good product!
B0002OZBT4|5|Gentle on hair and skin, scent lasts without the bad parabens, SLS, etc. Pricey but worth it! Our entire family uses this. I am prone to flaky scalp and dandruff but after my head adjusted to this the first week, I don't get the dandruff anymore.
B004QO0M9A|5|lovely
B002LTT65I|5|i love these.  Simple and quick sanitizing.  I haven't had any problems and I'm able to fit all my pump accessories and other items like pacifiers or a bottle.  Will definitely be getting more.
B000GEDO80|4|It didn't fit perfectly onto our Babytrend double jogger but it did it's job nonetheless.  Used it for The Color Run.
B004KBLDHO|5|Heres a little background. My baby is exclusively breastfed, 12 weeks old, most of the time using a shield (dont know if that matters). She HATES bottles and refuses every nipple i've tried. If (god forbid) I have to leave her with someone else for a few hours, I'll get a call with her screaming bloody murder in the background because she's starving but won't take a bottle, and eventually she'll scream herself to sleep or will stop when I get there with the \\"real-thing\\".<br /><br />I just got these bottles last night because I HAVE to have a sitter tomorrow and I don't want to tramatize her with my inconsolable baby. I like that these are for sensitive tummys since she does have colicky moments, and I don't mind extra parts. So I warmed some pumped milk, filled the bottle, prayed a little and gave it to her. FIVE SECONDS LATER she was eating perfecly fine!!!! I literally dropped to my knees and thanked God. I was shocked but actually works!<br /><br />The nipple is not too long that it chokes her, like many do. Its also VERY soft and moldable unlike some hard nipples on the market. Additionally, sometimes she would choke on other bottles because it flows too fast. This one she had no trouble with the flow speed whatsoever. It is rounded around the nipple like a breast and it truely IS as \\"Close to Nature\\" as possible. If I could give this 10 stars I would. Its worth every penny. If you have a baby that won't take a bottle TRY THIS its truely a life-saver!
B007XLC6I8|4|It fits the stroller perfectly, but I sometimes feel like I'm saran-wrapping my baby. Other covers seem to have a more free-flowing plastic that's open on the bottom, which would allow for more air flow.
B007I79JZA|4|I liked the wash clothes more than the towel considering the quality. And the price in mind(sub $15) I found the quality good. Cotton is soft and feels nice though again with price in view all over I found it satisfactory. We use this along with other towels though with bright color options I find it better value option.
B001CB3FL2|5|THIS FITTED SHEET FITS A REGULAR MATTRESS WITH A 2&#34;MEMORY FOAM TOPPER. GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE, I CANT COMPLAIN.
B00NWGWPSO|2|I like the cup however my son wants nothing to do with soft tipped cups he didn't like it I imagine that it is a good product but quite expensive.  As for me I wasted money when I should have started with the toss and fill cups.
B00GJIXN06|5|Beautiful
B00DTGL74K|5|More than expect, the effects it's not  so fast than traditional medicin but not hurt your body. My wife use it for years to calm down the anxiety, recommendation by a doctor friend.
B00UR2EUVQ|5|These are fabulous. Can be washed repeatedly right in washer. Very durable. Still using some after 3 years.
B001AH7B9U|5|This bed is a grand value for the price. All wood, easy to assemble. I will probably be able to sell it when my daughter grows out of it for the price I paid for it. Well done !!
B00BUYTLE6|5|good
B00CQBKLNC|5|My granddaughter loves this lunch bag.
B00AHVR94W|5|I bought this because I wanted the LATCH system. There are only two other brands available with LATCH. While they both looked like great options, I was not wanting to shell out the money for them. This one came on the market the very day I was needing to place my order. It's less expensive because the LATCH system is attached to fabric pieces, meaning that they can flop around when not installed. The other two brands have rigid LATCH systems, meaning they are steel poles that can't move around when not installed. Either way, you still get the greatness of LATCH.<br /><br />This was very easy to assemble -- just snap the arms into place and put it in your vehicle. My son is just under 4 feet tall, and weighs about 47 pounds, and he is 5 years old. He fits well into this. We are so happy with this purchase...highly recommend.
B00005N9X8|5|These gates are great because they are so easy to install.  I wish that they sold them in wider extensions rather than just 5\\" at a time but I just bought a lot of them!  The gate is great too because it is user friendly for a high traffic area.
B00GS1GZ68|5|This highchair is amazing especially for the price. It's pretty basic but that's what I wanted. Sure, it would be nice if it reclined a little but other than that it's perfect. The fabric seat cleans super easily with just a wipe of a wet rag. Love it!
B003MUA5OG|2|I bought this base on those good reviews, but when I really using for my baby, it did not work for us.<br />What I love about this product: 1, it is so easy to pull apart, and every little case has it owe lid with a small opening. The small opening is good to pour formula or small size snack. 2, it looks cute.<br />Why it does not work for me: It does not seal good! I normally pack my baby's snack the night before, in case we will get too crazy the next day morning. I pack the little duck dry fruit in it, the next day, the dry fruit snack bit feels like a rubber. I don't live in somewhere very humid, and I was not very impressed with it for dry snack. Then I tried with fresh fruit. It leak the fruit juice in to my diaper bag. Even that I did my best to dry the fruit before I pack them. So not recommend for pitted cherry or water melon. return it.
B0052QYLUM|5|I bought this because I have heard there were problems with the Summer brands and being able to see into others signals and with a lot of kids in our neighborhood I didn't want to deal with that so I got this monitor.  It has been great.  It is the perfect BASIC video monitor, and I think people forget that it is a BASIC video monitor. Heck, it's only $99!<br /><br />There are other reviews on here that complain about screen size and when the monitor turns on due noise or lack of motion.  The screen size is fine for what it does.  I don't need some HD top of the line screen.  Just something that I can see if my child is awake on.<br /><br />All I can say is that with as much noise as a baby makes and as much as a baby moves in the middle of the night I would not want it to go on every single time, no one would ever sleep because the monitor would be turning on every 5 minutes!  Now our bed room is close to our child's room so I can hear when he makes small noises and I am fine with it not turning on, but if he crys, coughs, sneezes, it turns on.  But that is good enough for me.<br /><br />The only con would be the beep the monitor makes when you have the sound turned on when it goes into VOX power saving mode.  It is a bit annoying, but at night we sleep with the sound off because like I said we can usually hear everything from his room, and I am such a light sleeper that the light turning on is enough to wake me up.<br /><br />Overall I love our little monitor.  We haven't had any problems with it interfering with our wireless and it works all over our 3600sqft house.  Oh and the camera can be mounted on the wall if need be...I only wish it could zoom in.  Thats it.
B00F2MQ258|5|Great kick and play for my little baby
B007UFW13M|5|My granddaughter  loves it.
B009JV34RC|4|The pillow works and is very comfortable for my 2 year-old. But it doesn't come with a case, so be sure to buy one or figure out a way to make your own.
B00BX137O6|5|My grandson loves it. He spends so much time in it.. He cries when I take him out.. He loves loves it
B000N46XTU|5|This is wonderful stroller for the money.  It was easy to assemble, and it looks and feels durable enough to handle years of rough use.  I particularly like the reversible handle, and there is very limited choice of strollers that have reversible handles, unless you are willing to pay a lot of money.  The only negative thing is that the harness is not removable.
B002LARFP0|3|I expected it to be softer. They are rough and not the best for a new born. Reconsider buying this for a newborn - older babies should be fine but I reckon you could buy something better/softer somewhere.
B0018CPUJ0|5|This car seat is awsome. My 4 year old loves it. Now he can get in and buckle himself and also unbuckle as soon as we get somewhere. So now he is a big boy like his brothers!     This seat is super easy to put together even though it doesn't look like it when you take it out of the box.    I purchased 2 of these seats as I use them to transport other children also. The other kids love them too.    Target had them on sale for [...] in this weeks ad but I always buy from amazon so I don't have to drive, it just comes right to my home, I also have the prime shipping so they were here the next day!
B00031XUG2|5|My first impression was that this is much smaller than I was expecting.  Actually a pretty good size for a young child to pick up and manipulate.  A simple toy that appears to be well made. Shipping was super fast.
B003I867US|4|great product
B004HMUIN6|4|These have become a staple in our home with teaching our son to eat. The spoons are flexible, they wash well, and are dishwasher safe. They are good for teething little ones as well. I have not noticed any shredding, so I have no worries he will accidentally swallow bits.
B002OOWAE4|5|I think this gorilla is the cutest toy. My 4 month old son loves it. When you press the button and the songs come on, he gets excited and starts to kick and laugh. Even without the gorilla, my son knows the songs when you sing them. The only thing that could be better is to have more songs. I can't wait until he can press the button on his own, but it keeps him occupied.
B008JFRMXG|3|For the price, I was hoping for the near perfect bag.  It is lacking for me.  I chose this bag for its larger size to have room for cloth diapers and my over-packing tendencies.  The backpack straps were a key requirement as well.  However, here are my main issues:<br /><br />Velcro closure of the main flap is very noisy and has snagged multiple blankets and clothing items.  I suggest PPB change it to a magnetic closure for the flap.<br /><br />Lacking a &#34;mommy pocket&#34;.  Suggest adding a pocket on the back or within the flap to allow room for wallet, phone, a ipad...  just needs some exterior space for mom items that get lost in the bag.<br /><br />Bottle pockets should be insulated.<br /><br />Changing pad seems like it should have more of a laminated, easy to wipe surface.
B00006C29H|1|My pediatrician told my husband and I not to buy this because of the danger of little toes getting stuck inbetween the big piano keys.  She told us not to get his one at all....
B00009IMCK|4|My daughter really enjoys this. I like that it can &#34;move&#34; into a couple of different shapes. It is colorful and she enjoys chewing on it.
B001I481LM|5|Once bought we haven't gone a day without using it. It really is helpful when making 6 bottles of 4-5 oz a day. Makes things much easier then spilling the formula as you try to get it in the bottle without getting the scoop wet as well. You just have to clean it after each use. No problem.
B003MU2FNK|5|Amazing product, created nice memories.<br /><br />I find the key to success for me is the temperature of the water. So I can mix the pink powder better to cast the fine details
B001VER3NQ|5|Delightfully soft blankets. Our twin grandsons love these. The circle pattern is cute & the colors go nicely with the striped bed ruffle using the same colors.
B0077P3U6W|5|I just love this chair!  The size is just right for our nursery, which is on the smaller side. The chair isn't bulky at all, but I don't consider it too small either. The fabric is nice and the color is very true to the picture.  It's really great too if you are short, as it's easy to get in & out of which will help prevent disturbing a sleeping baby.
B001DZWIH4|1|This Product is Very Tiny.Much smaller than expected.
B0042GPVGG|5|I purchased these for my nursery and they look amazing!  My husband surprising commented on how much they add to the decor of your room. The arms are large so if you are wanting your curtains to be held tightly these are not for you. I used hooks to hang them on and it worked perfectly!  I would buy again if needed!
B000H953Y2|5|I used an infant bath sponge like this one for both of my children and the foster babies we tended.  I have, also, given it as part of a baby gift.  I can't praise the product strongly enough.    For new borns, I placed the sponge on the counter top beside the sink.  I, then, had both hands free to bathe the baby.  Until a child could sit up, I used the sponge in the bathtub.  I would fill the tub with water to the level of the sponge.  Again the sponge held the baby so I had two hands free to do the bathing.  When finished, just wring out the sponge and set it in the corner of the tub.   It's lightweight, so it is easy to take if you travel.  Once a child could sit up, I had them sit on the sponge and didn't worry about them slipping and possibly hitting their head on the tub.
B005P07HS8|4|I ordered these breast pads based on a friends review. Overall, I like them as they are very absorbent and wash well. However, I am small breasted and when I wear a nursing tank (which is pretty much all I'm wearing right now), you have to be kind of careful with the placement to minimize the visibility under my shirt. I sometimes can still see my nipple. I also bought the blue, round overnight pads, which while very absorbent, show ripples under my clothes. With thinner shirts I prefer round pads to the heart shape because I think they are less visible, but these overnight pads dried ripply in the drier when compared to the Charlie Banana brand.
B00CG3CBVK|5|Much softer than expected. They wash nicely, are a good size at 47x47. .  Has so many uses and cute boy prints!
B00NTQKB1A|1|The material is very cheaply made. I will never buy from them again.
B000066CMV|5|I used Isis Breast Pump for the first 3 months for my first baby.  It was easy to use and functioned well, most of times I was able to empty my breast in ~15 minutes.  When I returned to work, I bought Medela Original Pump in Style for dual pumping, and I used the silicone petal massager from Isis for better suction.  Medela worked great too.  For comparison, I would say both are equally good at getting the milk, and comfort level and ease of use are about the same.  If money is your concern, I suggest use Isis... since it is much cheaper than Medela...  If you are short of time, I recommend buy Medela because you can pump both breasts at the same time, effectively increase efficiency ratio by a factor of two.  One reminder, you might need a little bit of time adjusting from one to the other as pumping methods are different: manual (Isis) vs. electric (Medela).  Once you learn the tricks of both, they work like wonders.
B001COIH3A|5|This is the only audio monitor that we have ever owned, but I am completely satisfied. Our baby requires loud white noise and so long as the white noise isn't too variable, this monitor doesn't pick it up. However, it always comes to life when she makes a loud noise or starts crying. I feel totally confident that we will hear our baby if she needs us. I also appreciate that it's small and tasteful looking.
B000HEUJVO|5|This pillow is amazing! It is soft yet still very supportive. I am pregnant with twins and it has really helped me get through the nights during the last trimester. One thing I love about it is the U shape. My hip gets sore if I lay on one side too long so the dual sides let me turn over without also having to flip the pillow. Overall, a great pillow
B0016J7LKG|3|My wife bought this to hopefully increase her milk supply, but she couldn't deal with the flavor of it. She tried for a week and didn't see enough of an increase to make it worth while.
B00AIVN8EQ|5|Helped my son out during tummy time! Even though he doesn't need tummy time anymore, he still uses the pillow to nap on. It also helped with keeping my son propped up while i breast feeded him
B001DZWIA6|5|I picked this product to keep up with little pictures given to me from co-workers or friends. I also used it to categorize pictures by age group for young children. This makes as a great gift for Christmas or even birthdays. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves memories.
B005WPQ0H0|1|I have been using this caddy for ages now and find it totally a must have and indispensable even now that my daughter is 3. I bought it as a baby shower gift and was so upset and dissapointed that it came totally damaged as it was packed so poorly. There was no stuffing or anything to protect the item since it is made from really strong cardboard it was all bent and damaged when it arrived... Would cost me more to ship it back so just trashed it... Such a waste considering it's a great item. I should hv ordered it from Target like I did before coz they packaged it well. Anyway all said and done.. It's a great item just make sure you buy it in the store or order it from Target or somewhere else coz amazon/ jj Cole packaging was lousy and u will receive a damaged piece!
B000056OV3|5|This Diaper Genie does a great job keeping the room smelling great!  My daughter is 13 days old and she is breastfed.  So she has about a dozen dirty diapers a day and the Diaper Genie keeps the odor completely out of the room!
B005I49R66|5|Love it! Works like a charm, keeps my baby asleep through the night and stops her arms from flying all over the place! :)
B001AV0ZXA|5|This stroller has it all.  It's not only stylish and super lightweight but also folds up in a snap, and is really easy to gate check for travel (we bought the Micralite bag for check-in as well).  We're constantly being complimented on the stroller and find it's really easy to maneuver, even one-handed.  Plus it has a pretty small footprint so I can take it into stores easily.    We wanted a stroller that would \\"grow\\" with our son so we don't have to buy multiple strollers, and he's literally used it since his first day home from the hospital.  The carrycot was a lifesaver and he slept and played in that more than his pack-n-play for the first three months.  It was the perfect size and we found little toys to clip to the sides and bonnet, to act as a mobile.  I rarely needed to use the baby monitor because I could bring him into whatever room I was working in.  And we could roll him back and forth next to the table so we could actually have dinner together, without one of us holding him.    We use this with the Maxi Cosi Mico car seat, which I also recommend and didn't require an additional fit kit to work.  The connectors for the carrycot and car seat were a bit hard to disconnect at first (better this than too loose) but they've broken in a little and now it's a snap.  I can't wait till he's big enough to use the regular stroller seat and the best part is that I don't have to buy another thing when the time comes, we're all set!
B0075M5H90|4|Fits the summer infant changing pad a bit loose but overall it will work fine.  Soft material with a bit of a sheen to it
B003YC0W8G|5|We have only used our monitor for a couple weeks, but are already very happy with the performance. My two favorite features are the temperature sensor and the lights to alert us when our baby is moving/making noise. We have never had a problem with interference. I would buy this product again.
B00V5KOVCM|4|I like it and would buy it again, but wish it had a little more texture so it was even more slip resistent. I have used it for 3 weeks with baby crawling and moving on it and no problems yet.
B007A2X47W|5|The knit squeak easy lion is great.  Our grandbaby loved it.  Lost the first one, so had to get a replacement.
B00AYZFGZA|5|Really cute and girly
B0071CQIJW|4|Love these sippy cups.  Only wish they still made the handle to match the spout, maybe a way to cut costs?
B004AA1YVK|4|It was a joy watching my 23-month granddaughter playing with this kitchen set. We put it together for her Christmas morning and she played with it for an hour straight.  She \\"fed\\" everyone in the house at least twice with things she'd \\"cooked\\" on her stove.  We had almost as much fun with the kitchen set as she did.
B0046N26YU|5|My baby loves this! Would totally recommend buying this product...
B008MO41J2|5|This cup is made to prevent leaks. It's very cute and sturdy and keeps my beverage warm. Love that it's dishwasher safe.
B003O1IA1S|3|I love the product; it's my baby's favorite. However, I ordered the purple/yellow pack and got a green/purple pack instead.
B000067PQ0|5|Unfortunately, I'm stuck using this, but medela has the fit of the shields I've tried. They hold up well, can be sterilized easily, and haven't stained. I would recommend getting a hard case to travel with, if you are stuck using it full time like I am. I also recommend having a backup, since my only real complaint it that it's easily lost (being clear).
B003Y3BH1G|5|Excellent for keeping baby's toys & soothers safe.
B00BQZKM6A|1|I really wanted to love these pouches, but they are too hard to use and keep clean. We gave up.
B000056JB8|4|LOVE IT! This is the 2nd one we've bought. The first one lasted a year+ before developing a slow leak that let water into the inflated part. But we use it every day so I figure we got our money's worth. My daughter loves it and I'm dreading the day she out grows it!
B00ESXRD9G|5|This is perfect for little hands.  The way it flips and transforms from one view to another activates their imagination. Not to mention that this toy doesn't make any noise.
B0055PESY4|5|I ordered this ornament along with a Ken ornament to commemorate my daughter's high school graduation.  Her grandmother started giving her Keepsake ornaments the year she was born.  The ornament was nicely packaged and arrived in a timely manner.
B000JOT2RO|4|These work great on high chairs and no more baby throwing or grabbing the bowl it stays put.
B004OYWY98|3|Our little one really likes this brush/ teether.  However, I really do feel that this \\"brush\\" is meant more for gums, not teeth.  We have used the [similar looking] Kushies Baby's 1st Toothbrush since day 1.  We love the Kushies brush, & it seems to be great for gums, as well as teeth.  This does an ok job as well, but the bristles are just too short to get a really nice clean on teeth.  In the pic, the bristles look longer than they really are.  Also, the bristles are shaped in a \\"v\\" shape, not in a straight row, as pic shows.  The handle is nice, but my little one can grip the Kushies Brush just as well.  However, both brands are great for chewing while teething.  I love that this, as well as Kushies, can be thrown in the dishwasher daily.  We do like this brush, but feel that the Kushies \\"grows with\\" a child longer.  All in all, a decent first toothbrush, but longer bristles would make more sense.  If you are looking for a simple teether for an infant with no teeth, than this is great; however, if you are looking for something to use for teething, AS WELL AS cleaning, then I would recommend the Kushies Baby's 1st Toothbrush.  The only drawback to Kushies is that it does not have the handle, and therefore cannot be hooked to anything (for those of you who might want the handle). I gave the Sharky Brush 3 stars instead of 5, due to the fact that it doesn't do a great job cleaning, and because the bristles in pic are misleading. Hope this helps!
B003LLPRPS|5|my baby very like this stroller.It's very cool.It sat feeling very comfortable and safe.Of course, it looks very stylish and beautiful.
B00HS3XCRK|5|These plates have worked great. No issues at all.
B0048EJX7A|5|The baby loves it  it doesn't really have many toys which makes cleaning it easier the colors are pretty and it is easy to put it together!
B000WEHO76|3|I bought this product when my daughter was 4 months old because I thought it looked really easy and convenient to use.  When I opened it, I noticed that the spoon was really huge and hard so I decided to wait and try it out when she got a little older and more used to eating from a spoon.  She's 7 months old now and eating 2nd foods, so I decided to break it out and use it for the first time tonight.  Normally she can eat an entire jar of 2nd foods in about 15 minutes with a regular infant spoon.  When I offered her the food in this spoon, she had to open her mouth really wide just to fit the spoon in.  It looked very uncomfortable.  Then when she actually got it in her mouth, she couldn't get the food off the spoon because it is way too deep.  She got about three bites halfway down (most of it drooled out onto her bib) before she started throwing a fit.  After those three bites I decided to get a container and a spoon and do it the normal way.  She finished the rest of the food in 10 minutes.  Unless your baby has a gigantically huge mouth, I'd recommend the old fashioned way.  That spoon is just too hard and huge.  Not to mention it is very deep.  My daughter is one of those babies who can't seem to wait for you to get the spoon to her mouth fast enough, so I thought this spoon would be perfect to start using since all you have to do is squeeze the bulb part.  It took me ten minutes just to get her to take those three bites.  I've been using the Munchkin Soft Bite Spoons since she started on her rice cereal.  Those spoons are the perfect size and the tip is flexible and not too deep.  She doesn't have to stretch her mouth open like Steven Tyler with those.  The idea is perfect because the food actually does flow smoothly into the spoon when you squeeze the bulb part, making it extremely convenient and easy to use... I just wish they could have made the spoon part softer and not quite as huge and deep.  Especially since you can only use it on 1st and 2nd foods.  Mydaughter will be starting 3rd foods soon and I won't be able to use this spoon because the hole is too small for any food that is even slightly chunky (it kinda splurts out and splatters everywhere)... unless you don't mind sitting there with a toothpick to unclog it after every bite.  My daughter doesn't have the patience for that!
B0018CMQ7Y|1|Sturdy and attractive. But the cover is not machine washable, which is a deal breaker for me. My son's diaper leaked, and \\"wipe with a damp cloth\\" is not going to take care of that situation. I gave it a good rinse, against the instructions, and it took 2 days to air dry. Diaper leaks definitely happen, so any baby product needs to be able to deal with it.  Comment
B00365E5IY|5|Best formula dispenser for your diaper bag.  It's tall and slender and fits also in your cup holder in the car or on your stroller if you need to mix a bottle in a pinch.
B00H2COJ2Y|2|Does not fit a normal binder in which you use in preschool-3 years old at a normal elementary school. Disappointing that the dimensions make it seem like it can hold folders and binders but it doesn't. Now if you use it for anything else it has to be same amounts but will work.
B00005RCS1|1|the material is very tacky and will be hard to remove from the included rolling pin. and then once you get the pin off and get a decent flat piece of material, when you go to give the impression, the material will then stick to the hand or foot upon removal ruining the impression, and you have to do it all over again. it was a horrible process.
B0049SP08Q|5|This toy goes for 5 buck at Babies R Us - so make your choices wisely guys. Overall great toy for our carseat and BB
B00M5CMRNE|5|I was a little skeptical at first but it seems to be working. My 1 yr old has been teething and she hasn't had gum swelling, drooling or the bright red cheeks like she did with earlier teeth.
B003XKOLJA|5|Good umbrella , very cute & the growling noise works well. My daughter loves it. We just need more rain.
B00P5USFBG|4|Was a little worried after reading some of the reviews. The first one I received was broken. Not the best start. Amazon, you are amazing with your customer service! After setting up the new one and having a few issues, I have a few suggestions for those wanting to purchase this. Taller bottles will give you a problem. We use dr brown bottles and they barely fit. The steam rises and will clog the openings for the powder. I have purchased wide mouth dr brown bottles, but have not arrived yet so I can't comment if it helped. We just use another container with a lid. Shake it up and pour it in our bottles.  It still takes under a minute. If having to take an extra 4 seconds is unacceptable, then by all means go back to doing it the way you did before. I love it. Some random powder will escape and be laying on the scale, sometimes water will too. It's not a large amount. I keep a washcloth handy and wipe it down. It does get sticky, not every single time, but frequently.  Again, if this is too much work, I'm wondering why you didn't just hire a nanny. If you feel this is too wasteful for formula and money, why are you even looking at a luxury product to begin with? Make 100 percent certain that you dry the parts in the formula container completely. The first set up will be exciting especially if your little one is going through a growth spurt and has zero patience and amazing lungs, DO NOT RUSH IT!  Your machine will clog after the 3rd or 4th bottle, which seems to be at 3am. On the redo, I actually set the pieces outside in the sun to prevent this from happening again. This machine isnt just a time saver, it is like having another set of hands. While I'm changing the little dude, my assistant is making a bottle. Granted, she may be a little messy sometimes and can't bring the bottle to me, she does knock down 93% and I'll take it!!!
B00MRZIGVG|5|Hands down the best sippy cups out there. My son loves them & we love them b/c they don't really spill unless my son throws it from his high chair.  Highly recommend this product!
B000H953Y2|5|We used this years ago for our first child for the longest time and it worked great. We had a hard time finding one for our newborn but I finally found it on Amazon and am very thankful. So much easier to bathe our baby girl on this versus getting down into the tub. We just put this on top of a towel on the counter and sponge bathe her on it! Works great!
B00068JNIQ|1|Wish I would have researched more kits before committing to this one. The nose sucker is cheaply made, the nail clippers are flimsy and the thermonitor doesn't beep when done. Don't be deceived by the red cross brand name like I was.
B0013FGWD0|4|Easy to install, cleans well, breathable for baby, glad we purchased it. Planning to use it for our 2nd baby
B0052ORWS2|5|I love these spoons! My baby just started eating and it fits in his little mouth perfectly! I read other reviews saying the flat edge didn't allow food to stay, but I didn't have a problem and I made him baby oatmeal really thinned out with breastmilk and did not have a problem! I will buy again if I need more!
B004DC9TD0|4|We've only had it for a day, but easy folding and unfolding. Easy to set up, a little confusing...seems to easy! One box, just as heavy as any other double stroller. My 2 year old LOVES it. He is tall for his age- 36 inches and weighs 28lbs, the canopy doesn't seem to bother him. Also, stroller doesn't pull to one side with only him in it- 3 weeks to go before baby #2!
B000HIP38Y|4|This was helpful to have as new parents.  Now that I'm more experienced judging bath temperature, it's not as necessary.  The only downside to it is that it can continue to beep even when it's out of the water.  Overall, good value.
B000XP96VQ|5|I love this stroller! We had a Schwinn that was handed down, but it was hard to steer and very heavy. This stroller is lightweight, easy to steer with one hand, and folds up nicely. My daughter loves it too. Ours came with a rain guard, which we have used many times. I also loved that it was half the price of other strollers in its class.
B00ISS2JPK|5|Bought this seat for my 2 year old, after she got a little too big for the first seat we got her. This was one is more slim than your typical infant car seat. It is designed for forward facing use only. It is comfortable and robust. I had to take the cover off and wash it after a potty training accident. It was fairly simple to remove the cover, clean it, and get it back on properly.<br /><br />I haven't found a better seat in this price range. It should be the last one my kid needs. I bought 2 of these and have been happy with both.
B000069EXN|5|This product is perfect for my little one.  I decided to buy a few more for my child to take to daycare since most won't put a blanket on a baby.  its great!!!
B000KQ5MCU|5|I bought the gerber plastic pants for my niece's new born twin daughters. She was so happy to get them. It is so much cheaper to use cloth diaper with plastic pant than throwing money away on pampers. She used pampers for both of  her sons. Now she has been able to save money for other things her children need.
B006Z6E8AG|5|perfect for the first teeth
B00K189GWE|5|spot on color
B00HM6D30E|4|At little pricey but it does work, great technology, I highly recommend this product, isn't a permanent fix but it works
B005MG86TY|5|No more countless hours and dollars with the nail technician. It provides the support I need for my natural nails. They look great.<br />Downside. Remove can damage your nail.
B00CBY99HS|2|The last package of 60 batteries I ordered had 3 dead batteries so far and I still have 17 left.  I wonder how many of these will be duds.
B0049VQGL8|5|I tan a lot thought i couldn't get any darker so decided to give this a try as dark as i was im even darker now i recommend this product 100%!!!
B000FYZ6U0|3|Item was way too large for my purposes.....it was well made but had room for sox and some tightly whites too!
B00UNZQCYU|5|I just got this and have only used twice.  So far I love it.  It is easy to fill and is totally silent.  i have two other  brand diffusers and like this one the best.  The only feature it doesn't have is the ability to turn off the light.  I knew this before I bought, so I didn't mark it down to 4 stars because of this.
B00662Z24A|5|Easy to use but it does take me several hours (2) to do whole manicure. Paid for itself in 2 mani's. Lasts about 20 days.
B003BPL57S|5|Smells great!  Feels good.
B00KMTA7MK|5|Very good product for my grey hair at 63 years old.  Really does take away the frizz that I have on one side of my head.  Great product.  Will buy again.  Also the product was wrapped very very well.  I appreciated receiving a product where you can tell extra care was taken to secure the product.
B002L1ANTE|5|I have been using the Shaver Saver cleaner for a ling tine and they are hard to find thanks for keeping these on hand
B0013MTHWQ|5|My praise for these match that which I have stated for the razor. Great price, great results, my girl loves them
B000PB2XHM|5|Love this iron. It gets super hot so be careful.
B00DZ3BBZ2|1|This stuff is terrible.  First, I'd like to know how you get it out of the tube.  I had to literally squeeze the whole tube in one hand as hard as I could to get a drop onto the toothbrush.  The taste was okay but after 3 days, I could feel plaque around the base of my teeth so knew it was not cleaning.  I used pro enamel which did clean but left a chalky taste on your teeth.  A, waiting on my tube of closyn to arrive as I feel that will be the best.
B002JAYMEE|4|Good Stuff, It doesn't leave an oily greasy feeling on your skin.
B006EP8PPW|5|I went out with my mom's friend to the mall and said my lips were feeling a bit chapped. So, my mom's friend took me to bath and body works and we asked the lady there about a really good lip balm. She showed us this one.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the word NIGHT. It just means that it works better if you dint expose your lips to any moisture for a while. (Such as water and saliva.)<br /><br />You may think that this is a rather small size for a lip balm but actually, you only need a tiny bit.<br /><br />This lip balm tastes GREAT!!! It kinda tastes like cake. Very good!<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this is the application and the amount it gives you. Like I said, you only need a little bit and the applicator DOES NOT help you with that. Otherwise, 5 stars all the way!!!!<br /><br />PS, it's cheaper at Bath and Body Works than it is on Amazon. It's 7.50 at Bath and Body Works.
B000C1VSK8|5|This is my favorite cologne for the money. Light yet pronounced I always get compliments when I wear it out.
B005CPZK26|5|I couldn't find this anywhere locally. I really wanted to try it after reading awesome reviews & because I love the hand cream in this collection. That's HG but this isn't quite as great. One of my favorites though
B009GEUPDS|4|I received the cleansing system from Influenster to test. I really like the cleanser. It smells good and makes my face feel cleaner and smoother after use. I like to use the brush for the harder to reach places, the triangle shape is very useful. I use my clarisonic primarily, but sometimes I will finish with the Olay brush around my nose. For the price, this is a very good option. I will definitely purchase the cleanser again!
B003BQ6QXK|5|I had a couple different shower mirrors over the years, all of which failed to work as promised.  This product works great and exactly as expected.  I won't rant on how great it is, because there are plenty of posts for that.  I wanted to share with anybody that uses the mirror that all you have to do is line the mirror with warm/hot water from the shower, you don't need to fill it up all the way.  I just spray the inside of the shower mirror with shower water before I shave and it stays clear long enough for me to shave.  I found filling it all the way up wasn't necessary.  It makes it easier to handle when hanging it back on its stand.
B002NNGLAU|5|The best foundation i have ever tried. It looks so natural. I have normal skin, however, whenever i wear foundation my t zone always gets oil but this foundation that didnt happen. I didnt even need to powder at all and it looked fresh all day, I heard alot of people say it is medium coverage and honestly depends on how much you put on. I am in highschool so i put a thin layer and evens out skin tone and covers most everything.
B001O9HTYG|4|We keep a tube at home and a tube in the car.  Really great stuff.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Tube itself tends to wear thin and end up leaking.  I keep buying because the product is so good, but count on leakage.
B00HVKR2LM|5|great for any skin color
B00FNUXQYE|5|This work perfect as a makeup primer it really did tighten my skin so my pores were less apparent and makeup application was much more smoother, it is light weight and refreshing. It has become a part of my makeup routine
B004Z40048|3|Very nice on but not easy with bein flexible to fitting your lid kinda stiff I also like the fullness
B0001HYKBW|3|I have been using a Norelco T860 for over three years. It's a great Trimmer, in fact, it's the best i have ever had. It still works just fine but i thought i would get a Norelco T770 becasue it was on sale and it has the built in \\"Vaccum\\".  <br /> <br />The new T770 looks much much better than the picture shown at amazon. The new T770 is black. It's looks & Works excellent. The Vaccum system is the best. It really works. It is also the best design for a trimmer i have ever seen. It has much more precision than the T860. I can get a very very close shave on \\"level 1\\".  <br /> <br />Now the drawbacks.... <br /> <br />It cannot be used while it is being charged. With the T-860, i was able to use it even when i was charging. The T-860 battery ran out while ago, it won't hold the charge anymore but i can still plug it in and use it. Therefore, when the battery fo the T770 is dead, you can't use it anymore. <br /> <br />Here is the very bad part: Once the battery is dead (won't hold charge anymore), you WILL have to DISCARD the T770. The directions clealy says that you will have to dispose the battery and DISCARD the trimmer. I don't know how many times i can charge the battery. It takes about ten hours to fully charge it and once charged it lasts over a month (i use it about three days a week). <br /> <br />It also has a two year warrenty. If i am not able to charge the battery in within this two years, i am calling Norelco <br />
B0018A32XS|5|This ladies shaver is just the right size and does a great job.
B00IQMRHR8|1|Item ordered late September and recvd 2 weeks after needed
B003FXG1RK|5|I should really just have a recurring order for this once every 8 months. I love this bronzer. It is totally natural and not shimmery at all, which I like.
B00CHJU06G|5|Good stuff And safe around eyes too ! No harsh Additives !
B007WR91L8|5|I like this facial cleanser. It's not too thick and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or as if there's a residue left on it. Just clean.
B0067F28ZW|5|Very pretty set.
B005TI4M7K|3|I was looking for the perfect shade of pink for the winter and bought this one because I saw it in Instyle Magazine.  The color is absolutely beautiful, but the polish only looks good for a few hours.  It started chipping within a few hours.  I reapplied the polish the next day and made sure I followed the directions...this time it lasted an entire day!  Not what I expected for the price. Nutra Nail needs to try again, because this could have been something great if it lasted longer than a day.
B0081V75CQ|5|They are firm brushes, but good for the price.
B00CAFAY0O|5|How I love this perfume!
B0047ETRFE|5|I have been searching for a nude lip color that would be flattering for my coloring, and this is it.  I am fair with black hair and green eyes.  I also like the formula of this product. It goes on creamy and keeps my lips soft. I reapply as needed as it is not a long lasting lip product, but I don't mind this. There is something very timeless about a woman checking her make up in a compact mirror and applying her lipstick, don't you agree?
B00HLC0NKM|3|My son has been using this soap for 2 weeks now but I don't see any improvement yet.
B00D1XM1CI|5|Love this mousse..curly hair can be tricky and this has been a true miracle..keeps my hair soft and manageable
B00DR7AIZU|5|I have thick and heavy hair-usually no clip / stick / band lasts long. These are not only good quality sticks but are simple OR not at all gawdy looking - which is why I like them even more.<br /><br />I do recommend this product with highest rating.
B009HBDK2S|5|Great Read.
B0009OAGXI|5|Great smell
B00HE1GYD0|4|I should have taken a before and after picture to be able to say anything definitive about any anti aging effects, but I do feel my skin tighter after using the product, and I have been told I look great by people who haven't seen me in a long time.<br /><br />Not conclusive since I've changed my hair color, length and style (which impacts the look of your skin drastically, as to get older your hair needs to be lighter or else the skin imperfections stand out) but I think I may be seeing some improvements in my eye lid puffiness. The upper lid was becoming droopy, causing me to have to change how I put my eye makeup on, but I think there's been some tightening there.<br />In order to give a definitive answer, I'd have to make no changes for a couple of weeks and take pictures. If I get around to that,I will be able to give a more accurate review. The product is good, it is easy to use and does have an effect you can feel. I just don't tend to pay that much attention to my looks or keep a consistent regimen.<br /><br />The manufacturers are sincerely interested in your enjoyment of their product and are invested in your success with it, so nothing I've said is due to any lack of their care and communication. They do want people to be happy and care about any concerns they have. They seem like good people and I'd consider more of their products for that reason alone.
B004VMF7OW|5|Update 03/30/15:  I don't know if they changed the formula of this pencil, but it doesn't go on smoothly or look natural. The light brown is a little too dark and the blonde looks orange. Bummer, I really wanted to love this.   I am absolutely obsessed with this brow pencil. I never filled in my brows, but since the ends are thinning out a bit, I needed to start using something. This is natural looking and matches my brow color perfectly (the light brown). I'm always getting compliments on how &#34;perfectly shaped&#34; my brows are. I wish it wasn't so expensive, but it lasts me about 2 months, so it's worth the cost to me.
B004SU886Q|3|Has a medium hold, good if you don't want your hair too crunchy or stiff. Great smell! However I'm not sure how &#34;volumizing&#34; it is.... I don't notice a difference.
B000E8O8UQ|4|love it
B001JHZ8H8|1|I was so hopeful about this product. I have to say, it smells nice. But that is it. It does nothing, and I mean nothing for my fine, curly hair. Total waste of money.Very disappointed...... Tried it b4 styling, as a leave in, as mentioned in the other reviews. And it simply does nothing. Infact, I think it may make my hair feel worse :((
B002EP9OUG|5|I ordered this kit and have been pleased with it.  I am not a professional, but I use this about once a month for my underarm and bikini-line waxes and it seems great to me.  I also purchased a can of soft wax and cloth strips for waxing my legs.  But the hard wax is great for smaller areas.  I don't use the oil or the cooling gel that came with the kit.  And I probably won't use the smaller application sticks, since I don't wax my face or eyebrows.  But the price was good for the warmer and the hard wax.  I do wish that the kit came with more of the paper &#34;Clean Collars&#34; to fit around the neck of the warmer.  The collar is very practical and, because it does its job, it gets messy quickly.  I will need to order more of those.  Overall, though, I think this is a good kit for the general home user.
B0013MTHWQ|5|I love it, it makes my legs feel very smooth. Smooth blades that slide right off my skin.
B00JZFB13G|3|It's a great sponge. I bought two but only received one...
B007JWZLBA|5|Works great and gives me about an extra month before having to spend the big bucks to get my hair professionally colored.  I've also used another product which is similar to mascara.  Although that one is also pretty good, I like this product much better because it offers better coverage and is faster to use.  I highly recommend this.
B0033ZC340|5|I love tinted moisturizer. I don't notice any anti-aging effects using this but it does give a nice, light cover and blends any unevenness out of the skin tone. Love it
B002T910MW|5|Ok.. first let me say this is my second purchase from this seller. The hair is amazing quality and thick. More then enough for an entire head. Do not buy the cheap hair from the local beauty supply store or the hair will smell horrible each time you curl or straighten it. It also will be thin and not look or feel real. This product though will be beautiful from the start. It holds a curl and is thick all the way down to the end. My last purchase I ended up coloring darker for the fall and it colored beautiful.  It didn't even change the quality of the hair either. The only tangle I had was underneath my hair if it wasn't washed within a few days. I just can't say enough about these extensions. There is almost too much hair. Try them and you will be happy. I have been doing hair for 20 years, from fusion to clip ins and these are the most natural and the clips really hold.
B001B680EA|5|love the oil induction easy to use for a clean feel.  I was very happy with the results. I keep one in my car!
B0053UJSFK|5|Works like magic.  Took 5 seconds, and I effectively am no longer thinning.  I just ordered 3 more.  While it will wear off throughout the day, I have worked out in the gym and been out in the rain, and it more or less stays on.  If you have most of your hair, and want something quick that effectively cleans up your hairline, order this product.
B00RY9Q1OO|4|I really like this brush, a little shedding but it's an awesome brush
B003Z4OD24|5|I found this product through a monthly beauty subscription.  Is it also highly rated for being safe for skin.  I use it 1-3 times a week.  It's great a great smell and leaves my skin feeling wonderful after.
B001Q55TCM|1|I churn through these mirrors because I'm always leaving them stuck to the motel mirrors. I usually buy Revlon but thought I'd try these instead. The optics aren't as good, it just doesn't seem as clear and its hard to find the proper distance to get myself in focus. And the suction cups don't stick as well. One of mine had a black frame and one was maroon.
B00005B9FV|5|I have been using this for years and love it.  It is light on the skin and does not feel greasy but provides good coverage against the sun.  I use it every day under my make up.
B00E5H3W36|3|Cap was very small
B002VHNES0|5|This is my second bottle of the 50%, I worked my way up to this percentage as well as how long I left it on. I started at 2 minutes and and now up to 8 minutes., Anything longer will irritate my face. After the 8 minutes I neutralize the acid with baking soda and water, then wash my face with just water, pat dry and apply an aloe E gel. I find that anything cream based will irritate my face and sting so I just stick to the aloe for a couple of days. I usually use ROC and a vitamin C serum daily so I skip those as well for a couple of days. In about a week my face is really clear and stays this way for a couple of weeks.
B008U8N26I|5|I have great results with this priduct
B000N796AU|4|I do like it, but if I put in near the top of my head it makes it look greasy.
B001GS6OB4|2|It worked well for about 4 months, and then it started to fail. It completely stopped working in a less than 1 year. I bought another one for 1/4 the price, and it's been working wonderfully for years.
B0002AHY6Q|4|its great so far. the only thing i dont like is the amount of water it holds. you have to refill it often to get the whole mouth. it works great though.
B0033UNAEW|5|Amazing soft clean scent. Excellent product for the price. Leaves skin feelin soft and subtle. Will definitely order in the future.
B000FBF5AY|1|Not legit. Pirate immitation! Not benefit products. Its fake. I would not recommend this product,  the original is tons better but this item is not a real benefit product! Hence why its cheap
B000C00V2U|5|Smells surprisingly very nice, wife loves it.
B00RUJNUNI|3|It sucked!!! The biggest waste of money that I had ever spent.
B00LQ48Z1A|5|good color easy to carry
B00BQUALCA|5|greeting<br />Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.<br />Have a nice rest of the day<br />goodbye
B001JQLNLY|5|I am 64 years old and I have been using Pro-X for about 6 months.  I can really tell the difference in my skin and so does everyone else.  My fine wrinkles have disappeared and my skin is more firm and illuminated.  I have  few crows feet around my eyes and they have softened considerably.  I was ready to go to a dermatologist - sign up for Botox or something similar - but this line has been my answer and it's way more economical than the alternatives.
B00MWIOZ2W|3|Good value.
B001BQ2E2Y|4|pretty and stay on very long.
B00384A2IK|3|I was really excited to try this and was hoping that this would be my cure-all for my hair but, unfortunately, it wasn't. My hair has tons of split ends yet I have oily roots. This does make it soft and manageable but it's not a miracle worker or anything. The nice thing about it is that it doesn't weigh your hair down which is why it trumps everything else in my stash.
B00904YM6U|2|I was hoping this product gave my hair silkiness and smoothness, but it did not, may be straight hair will benefit from it
B000ORPZIG|5|Best color ever very natural!!
B000068PBT|5|Super!
B00JYLZPBK|3|It falls off very quickly. I love the color though.
B00A3LVMMQ|5|does exactly as described
B007XN7MSK|1|The cap only fits the crown of my head. The wig itself is super cheap feeling and looks fake too. It is near white in color and straight. Good length though
B0000691JH|5|I have incredibly sensitive skin. You can hand me any kind of lotion for red bumps and mine will still be there. I also end up with the worst ingrown hairs known to man. Shaving has never been ideal for me, especially in the bikini area. I have tried depilatory creams that still leave my skin with red bumps. Depilatory creams are also filled with chemicals and I am all about the naturals for my body. When I searched for alternatives to waxing and shaving I came across Moom. I was skeptical, but it was worth a try. I have never had a wax nor have I ever waxed myself, so I knew this was going to be trial and error.<br /><br />When I first used Moom I tried the smaller strip on an area of my skin. I had to heat it up in the microwave just slightly so it was more spreadable, but let it go back to room temperature. I spread a paper-thin layer like the instructions said, rubbed the cloth strip rapidly over the wax, pulled my skin taught, and holy cow. Hair gone. It didn't even sting as much as I anticipated. I do have a high pain tolerance, but all women know the bikini area is always incredibly sensitive. My skin was red for about 48 hours, but I applied coconut oil twice a day and exfoliated with a loofah and continue to do both every day.<br /><br />Many other reviews say that doing large areas at a time give the best success, but I have to disagree and I disagree only because I am inexperienced. I ended up cutting up my cloth strips into smaller pieces and using them that way. Also, as I vaguely mentioned above, I do heat it up in the microwave so that it is more spreadable, but I do wait for it to go back to room temperature first. The thinner you spread this stuff the better results you will have. Less hair is removed if you have a ton of this stuff on your skin.<br /><br />After I finished I let the used cloth soak in water for about five minutes. The product came off no problem.<br /><br />If you want natural results that keep your skin clean and exfoliated at thesame time while waxing, then go all natural and go with Moom.
B001S2PLNK|5|This product is amazingly simple and it works! If you are going to use The Sonicare, then you owe it to yourself to get these.  After I received them, I became concerned that the material was too thin, but it proved to be very, very, very strong and stretches for an air-tight fit. No more ugly residue build-up!
B002PBHQEK|5|Really, really love it!  It feels great, almost no smell and cleans very well.
B00EXPSDWA|5|Works
B001E722ZY|5|My gums no long are tender and sore since I eliminated all the crap in other toothpastes- fluoride, aluminum, teeth-whitening ingredients. Teeth are as white as ever and gums healthy.
B004E3ION4|5|My husband loves these.
B003IU795S|5|I have been giving this to my 4 year old for over 3 months. Mixes well with juice (especially V8 Fusion Acai Berry). She seems to have a more restful sleep, less movement and talking during sleep and less tic movements. She focuses well at school. Highly recommend this product!!
B000GCWNPW|4|Was looking for something to replace my hair wax that just ran out (have been using L'Oreal Indestructible Sculpting Wax but can't seem to find it anywhere). Took a gamble on this small obscure looking green colored wax and boy was I pleased! Holds ur hair in place and gives you the peicey/ faux hawk look. Hair feels a bit hard though but that's ok. Washes out considerably easily too.
B001GIOV82|1|I really like burt's bees' eye cream and this is my one of my re-orders . The little glass jar I received previously from amazon had nothing printed on it, but this one came with a 7-digit number 0030801. I guessed it would be some code indicating the date it expires/was produced, so I looked it up online and on burt's bees' official website \\"[...]\\" , it says \\"the first three numbers are the day of the year the product was made (aka Julian Date). The next two digits are the year, and the last two digits are a batch number \\", so this means the product was produced on January 3rd, 2008!!! OMG!!! Then the website says \\"Our products should be in good quality condition for 3 years. We recommend that our products are used within 12 months after opening since they are natural products. \\" Even giving it 3 years, the product has long since expired !! I can't believe that Burt's bees is this shady, selling long expired products on Amazon!! Returning this!! Don't buy this product!!! Otherwise you would be applying poison to your eyes while you think you're taking care of it!!!
B00A7GECV0|5|Great price, cheaper than any other place.<br />The gel nail polish lasts about a week but I like the fact that is very easy to remove.
B00LW09EI6|3|Ok for my Halloween make up.  Does not stay on very long even with a shadow base.  Gorgeous colors!
B0058CJV50|5|Love the smell of this product. It doesn't make my hair greasy at all. Works very well. Would highly recommended this product to friends.
B00HAQWM7G|5|Incredible quality.  Great seller and hoping to purchase again in the future!
B003P53KYU|5|Love the product - purchased first from a dermatologist and then for a bargain from Amazon.  I use the Vitamin C Serum & the Exfoliating Day cream and my complexion is the best it has ever been.
B008KHRLKW|1|Batteries not working, bad quality, horrible sound. Bad material, don't let the brush pictures fool you it is really bad. I hate it. It doesn't even sing... Didn't work from the first day...
B00406ZIBQ|2|Package different than before..  also this cream different than before...Seems not effective on my face.
B001MA0QY2|5|This product is a very solid professional-style flat iron.  heats up faster and warmer, not flimsy, very solid and a pleasure to use.
B001JQLNOG|5|Love Olay products
B000VSG1PO|1|I bought this eyelash curler from Organic Direct at the beginning of August when I heard they were no longer going to be available in the US.  I had one I had purchased locally at Sephora, which was fantastic.    The curler I received was in an authentic box and looks real enough, but I think it must be a knock off.  Almost immediately, the supposedly silicone pad wore a deep grove that pinched my eyelashes.  This morning, after less than two months of use, the thing broke into pieces.    I checked Sephora and found that indeed the shu uemura curler is no longer available in the US, but they offer a Sephora Collection substitute for $16 with a silicone pad that customers have given glowing reviews.    I have requested a full refund from Organic Direct.  I am awaiting their response.  For now, I am heading over to Sephora!
B001E5D0L6|5|Absolutely love this soap.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I have an oily complexion and it keeps my skin clear and clean.
B009YSSLGE|5|Use it every day. Big fan of the dove for men products
B0036I8BPE|2|I used this product alone as directed by the package directions. i did not notice any improvement. As far as, shine and manageability. I also used it in conduction with another product which was recommended to use with it. The results were better. I used the other product alone and achieved better results. I should have just purchased the other product.
B006HCJXBM|3|OK FOR TEEN
B004N31OPA|1|I can't explain why I don't like these, but I don't like them.  They didn't exactly taste bad, but I didn't like them.
B000E3C7W2|5|I love all this products. It is really work. After it my hands is really soft and smell nice as a peach.<br />Definitely I will buy it again.
B008QTH40Q|4|I love this dryer. Dries hair fast and love the color. I am glad I made the purchase. Will buy again.
B000P2750G|5|Love this.....  been wanting to try it for years and finally splurgred.
B004E6309E|5|great.
B004LTVWLW|5|work's all the time.
B003ITMPI0|4|I really like how it rolls up into a portable square with a handle.  I wish it was about 2 inches longer and 2 inches wider.  It fits a TON of stuff, but I use it everyday and put ALL of my stuff in it (hangs on the back of my bathroom door), so a little bit of extra space would have been better for me, but this works. This is the largest hanging bag I could find with four clear compartments, a hanging hook, and that is still portable, so I'm very happy with it.
B0007ZHMOK|1|I really like how my nails look and feel after I use this treatment. I find I get the best results by removing my polish and using this nail balsam 2 or 3 times a day on the days that I don't work. I am a nurse, so my hands are in soap and water or alcohol based cleansers repeatedly on work days and my nails are in deplorable condition. I am endlessly searching for something to stop them from tearing and peeling. This product seems to help to moisturize them on the days that I don't work. I am still searching for a good strengthener/protector to wear on work days to protect my fragile nails.<br /><br />**Edited Jan 28, 2013** it was a short love affair. This product was nice for a few weeks, then my cuticles were becoming more and more dry. I finally found that my cuticles were better on the days I forgot to use this product. I have moved on to another product.
B0007OERQC|5|My beautician advised me to begin washing my face in milk, instead of soap. I finally found this product, and have been using it ever since! I find it cleans better than soap, and my skin has a silky feeling. When I could no longer find it in my local stores, I almost panicked!! Instead I called Helen of Troy and was told to go to Amazon, which I obviously did. This product will make you look and feel younger. (And I am 83 years old!) Kudos to Helen of Troy and Skin Milk!
B000NJMT3E|5|Exactly what I wanted and expected. Very happy customer!
B00HS4O36I|5|This lotion is great and these are the perfect size for travel.  I've even turned several of my friends into fans.
B008UBEABQ|4|I love the dotting tools as they work well and have a variety of sizes.  I am not sure about the brushes just yet, the quality might not be as good on those.  I love that it came in a bag so I can keep it all together.
B007GPHQAE|5|Love the different light colors and intensity as well as the option to have no light.  Been impressed with with the mist/steam used with essential oils.
B003MUYUU6|5|MY HUSBAND BOUGHT ME THIS PARFUM FOR CHRISTMAS AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. IT IS THE TYPE OF SCENT THATS HARD NOT TOO LIKE. SO PLEASANT AND ELEGANT. DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITES EVER!
B00LYST1D4|5|Love the colors.
B000LN2TZ0|1|Perhaps the most pricy bottle of water I ever purchased....almost no scent at all.  Not worth it.
B00QEZJO8O|4|This product did not have an overwhelming scent.  It was a mild fragrance.  It left my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I also used it on my hands and got the same result.
B00AFLSE7U|3|I've been trying this out for 1 month and it seems to be working. I used to have deep wrinkles but it seem to lessen. So hopefully after 1 year I'll look good again.
B006GQYSGO|4|could shave better, but O.K.
B00OPCHAB6|2|When I received the product, the plastic lid underneath the cap was opened......this bothered me greatly.
B002WYZ4TY|2|I purchased two travel pouches.  One closed properly the other one did not stay closed.  I have to use a rubber band to keep it closed.  Quality control should test these pouches to assure they close properly.  The one that is defective is not worth returning.
B0043OYFKU|5|I love this item
B000MI85FC|5|Great item for getting alcohol using one hand
B00EP5S7HE|5|This is by far my favorite self tanner. I have been bronzing for years on my fair complextion. I gave up cancer beds and starting to take care of my skin and this product looks amazingly natural and does not smell. The color does not smudge and fades well. The only downfall is i have to apply nealry every night and the mitt it comes with doesnt last long, but luckily wal mart now carries one similiar so it can be replaced. I will definaltely continue to use this product..well done.
B003MWURBK|5|Used it on a  recent hospital stay.  Liked it and would recommend it for personal care.gentle and very effective..for that fresh clean feeling.
B00AUB2O12|3|This is the third one of these I have bought. You need to know two things - these wear out quickly, and they help - but don't stop - snoring.  I wear this every night.  It reduces my snoring, and I feel more rested in the morning.  My partner also sleeps better, but I do still get poked in the side from time to time.  I guess you could say it's a &#34;softer&#34; snore.<br /><br />Also, the little &#34;balls&#34; at the end that go in your nose, pop off after about 6 months of use.  I always buy a backup pair that I use when my new one is on order.  Fortunately, they are pretty cheap.
B004E84P4Q|5|I love this product and have ordered before. U surely will again!
B003V32UAQ|5|Simple, easy.  Worked exactly as intended
B00ICQVNLY|5|LOVE this!  I thought it was pricey, but definitely worth it.
B004W2UMDW|5|I was skeptical about the razor pit.  I paid $25 for mine.  I figured I have lost $25 dollars more than once so why not lose it again? For me? This product works. 1.1.2015 to 5.26.2015.  Same razor I have been using is all I can say.  It will not sharpen your razor like when you first cracked open the pack. But it cleans and aligns the razor back  to being able to shave again. I use a Schick Hydro 5. And it's been good so far.  I don't know how long it will go but I am experimenting. Some razor's may not work as well, I do have others I am going to put through the test.  From what I gather through comments I believe it depends on how corse ones hair is, what kind of blade, how many times one shaves etc.  I shave about every other day to two days. You have to play with it. I notice doing it with too much pressure does not work as well.  There is an in between soft and hard that does work.  Almost months. Even if some one gets an extra week out of it. If you do the math it's more than before. I will run it 50 time I've even went 200 times. I may not have had too. But it works for me.  if you are impatient this product is not for you. experimenting it's the only way to find out how it will work for you. And @ 5 months almost for 1 razor? I'm good.
B002BONDR0|4|This bag is very cute. It's better quality than I expected for the price. I use this bag to carry books around at book sales and so far it has held up pretty well. The material is a little like felt and does attract A LOT of animal hair if you have any, just a warning. But otherwise it's a great bag for the money.
B001FYZTEW|5|Its good for those who wants natural lashes but has that pizzazz feel as well. Not too dramatic. It'll be good for starters and every day look.
B00IFMA3PW|5|The kids loved this and used it like facepaint. It stayed on pretty well in a swim, and when it does rinse or rub off, you can see because of the color.
B00115LBII|1|What you see is NOT what you get! You only get one half of what is displayed in the picture, and mine broke after 3-weeks. I don't know what the problem was.
B00DL4UB4W|5|These are awesome and work great!  Will buy again!
B003G05K6K|5|Amazing face wash
B00620W028|5|I always thought condoms were annoying and uncomfortable until i tried these.  They make all the difference.  If you have ever had the feeling that the condom squeezes you or cuts off circulation, give these a shot.
B000OYLBA0|5|Love this product, but it has become unaffordable. Can't buy it anymore.
B000GEJR8G|5|Arrived fast. Exact color I was looking for after I had a manicure at the nail shop with this color. Very pleased
B00PFEFZ7O|5|A little darker than I was looking for but a beautiful color that lasts.
B000E8PG98|4|This dryer has the features I wanted, and works like I hoped. It dries my long hair quickly, though I don't know for sure it would do the same for super-thick hair. Also, combined with the right technique and product, it leaves hair is smooth and shiny. Some people have complained about the weight; I haven't noticed it being heavy at all, and I consider myself puny.    I like the retractable cord, although I learned the hard way to hold the plug while retracting. It does have two speeds (besides off) and three heat settings, along with a cool shot button. It also uses ceramic technology, though not tourmaline, for those who are up on those kinds of things.    All that said, my point of comparison was a 15-year-old dryer that was probably cheap to begin with. If you're looking for something nice, I'm sure there are better dryers out there, including better Conair models. But this does exactly what I need. I found this on sale for around $15 and I feel like I got a great deal for that money.
B00C6OGXIG|5|It arrived quickly, and I like the product
B00JTFHSK2|3|Ok
B000052Y6A|2|The bad: The hold of this wax is mediocre, and even though it says it's \\"neutral\\" it leaves my black beard looking grey.<br /><br />The good: nice scent, cheap price.
B004NMH0ZO|4|Used this product twice and it really smooths my skin and it feels softer.  Love that it's alot of product for the price. Will use it twice a week so hopefully my tone and texture will improve alot especially before the summer.
B000IVDFVC|5|I put this on at night and then wear cotton gloves overnight since it's greasy.  It soaks in quickly, heals dry cracked skin and soothes hand arthritis too.
B002CVTVUA|5|Every time we go to the pediatric dentist, they are always impressed by how clean my daughter's teeth are.  I'm quite sure it's because of this awesome toothbrush.  I like that it beeps when she should change quadrants in her mouth, letting her know how long is appropriate.
B001FB5IIW|2|TOO GREASY
B00HLUQENY|5|I chose a rating of 5 for this product because of the combination of quality and value.  It makes my teeth feel so clean, like I just came back from the dentist.  I had a sensodyne for years and finally got tired of paying the high prices for replacement toothbrushes which led me to try this brand.  I'm so glad I did.  It is a superior product in every way.  The other reviewers said that you need to polish each tooth with this brush and they were right, that is the way you get the best benefit.
B006K3WW34|5|Gentle with a lovely fragrance. Often hard to find. Read the box story about its formula being a gift from Napoleon to his sweetheart :)
B00ACB6H9A|5|This product is a very good thing. It will fit in a woman's purse for easy travel. They are very good at straightening hair.
B00BOJB0AK|5|Amazon was truly a worry free way to purchase a item.. Good work..
B003F2T0M4|5|Absolutely awesome product. First of all, I've had this curling iron for 3+ years now and it still works FLAWLESSLY. The heat is even, the wand heats up quickly, and it cools down quickly once it's turned off. Secondly, this iron creates curls that are SO DIFFERENT than the ones I've achieved with a traditional curling iron with a clip. The curls are much more natural looking, no ugly clamp marks, and the curls last all day in my hair, even when I brush out my hair several times a day. I have long hair, and my hair used to weigh down curls within a few hours, but I don't even have to use hair product when I use this wand... the only thing I can figure is that this wand is pure magic. Don't let this curling tool intimidate you, it' super easy to use, and I've never ever burned my fingers on it (I've used it hundreds of times and don't even use the glove). So worth the money!
B001AX87EW|5|This is one of my wife's favorites and it is now mine. Subtle, yet effective (wink, wink)
B004NTS3QW|3|I think this works as well as most conditioners.  It smells really nice and feels good on the scalp.  Not sure if it really &#34;awakens my roots&#34; or any of that jazz.
B001MA0QY2|5|It arrived yesterday and I immediately tried it. I've had trouble with my other straighteners because my hair never wants to actually become stick straight and stay that way for more than a few hours. However, I used the HSI yesterday, with just a drop of the argan oil, no hair spray or other products and my hair is still completely straight today after a full day outside in Floridian humidity, and an entire night's sleep. It's still smooth and silky and not even my most stubborn curls have reappeared. I also had it in a ponytail for half the day and there was no annoying bump after I took it out, for the first time ever. Very happy with the purchase.
B004RGKZVM|5|Bar soap requires 5-8 rinses to remove soap.  1-2 rinses with this soap.  Really cleans up pores and problem areas.  Use this on sore spots and clear them up within a minute or so.  I like it, even if it is expensive.  As others have said, this soap has the consistency of water.  It drains through fingers and is wasted.  It must be directly applied to the area to be cleaned vs hand application, if one doesn't want to waste this expensive soap.
B003C54M9A|1|I intended to use this for pest repelling.  I don't know if it would have worked, because I procrastinated and it sat on a shelf for a few months.  This complaint is about the packaging.  One day I noticed that the plastic bottle was sweating.  Little beads of resinous material were seeping through as the plastic was being dissolved.  The packaging is not suited for containing its contents.  I posted a photograph of it.<br /><br />I asked to return it.  The company said it was past the 90 day limit, but they'd be nice and take it back anyway.  I wasted another $10 to ship it back to them.  I put it in a ziploc to keep it from leaking through the box.  The company claims they never got it.  I never got my refund.
B00HA71V1S|5|great product great service thanks John F. Rand
B00J2F54TG|2|I loved it at first but the sprayer completely stopped working after very little use.
B00AO379SO|5|First deodorant I've switch since high school! Now that's saying quite a lot for me. It's no Degree by a long shot but, it does a fairly good job at protecting you within 24 hrs of the day when you need it most. However I don't give into the 48 hrs they claim it be. It is to be individually determined of how long it really last by which activity you are involved in during the day/night. Everybody perspires differently. The scent has a laid-back mystery kind of metallic tones to it. So if you're looking for something with more of a straight edge scent that doesn't have an overwhelming smell give this cool silver a try.
B00DH0TRYA|5|wish they has this color first since I ended up with a plain black one that im gonna have to either donate or fill with more plates! very decent quality you can even double up on each pocket without worry
B0000AYXBO|5|With the blue beads this body wash is so soothing, you will feel refreshed after your shower. I reccomend this for every women especially hard working woman
B001MP0QH4|5|It is excellent
B002SJ4ADO|5|my fiance uses this every day and since we can no longer find it in stores here in w.pa buying it by the case was a smart move. now he has unlimited supply for now.
B0013945IA|5|the best product at the best price.
B001G2B8NO|5|these have become my fav lashes, good price and fast shipping
B0035XZGCG|3|It is okay. I need something to get rid of the laugh lines around my eyes and I just cannot seem to find the right product. The eye gel helps soften them but they are still there.
B004SU88CU|4|I picked some up at target since it was affordable and looked like it had less chemicals than some of the other brands. Smells super good and held the curl all day.  Lots of compliments on my hair.  It can be crunchy if you put too much on.  I put a quarter size amount in my palm and dilute it with some running water and run it thru my still damp hair. It only takes a small amount for my thick long hair.
B001E76840|5|For backcountry hiking! This stuff works great! It goes on easily.  I'm a a regular fan of liquid solid deodorant rather than solids or rollers, but this fit the bill and I'm satisfied for the limited choices there are for quality fragrance free deodorant.  I ultimately melted it down to a liquid and put it in dispenser tubes where it cooled to a solid again and worked out great[[ASIN:B00XIRS9U0 Empty Lotion Stick Tubes for Making Homemade Lotion, Deodorant, and Cosmetics, Mini Size Tubes, 0.5oz, (8 Pack)]].  25 mile trip over two days and this stuff kept the odor away!
B00IT1HKV4|3|Be aware that this does have an unpleasant odor! It's not terrible, but it's not a good smell either. It has sort of a motor oil smell to it. That said, it does wonders to moisturize my dry skin in winter and protect my hair. I'm glad there isn't any artificial fragrance, but I wouldn't mind if it smelled just a little nicer. I'm very self conscious about how my hair must smell when I wear this.
B001VEK1HQ|4|Perfect replacement cartridge.
B000OV3ZDO|3|You need to use this product everyday to see results. I stopped using it for 2 days and then my color went back to original  shade. I was in the Caribbean Islands for a few months and had a major tan on my legs. I used this product and the tan went away. The product is good for people who want to get rid of tans but it is not good for people who want to improve the shine and glow of their skin. I saw better results with natural products such as lemon!!!
B003XDVERE|5|Use this product all the time.
B007PN22NI|5|This is wonderful.  I had a latter model that wore out.  This works much better.  I like the fact that it is cordless.
B0039UTO5A|4|This mascara makes my lashes look thicker and longer.  It goes on without clumping.  The regular (not waterproof version) stays put and does not give you raccoon eyes by the end of the day and is easily removed.  Love it.
B00B57QU60|4|I hate having chapped or dry lips, so I apply lip balms throughout the day, and I use Vaseline on my lips at night. I have been using the Nivea Lip Butter exclusively for over a week now, in place of the balms and Vaseline, to see what how it compared.<br /><br />The Lip Butter is a serious lip balm, not a waxy product designed for fun flavors or color.  It lasts for a long time, I don't have to reapply often.  My lips feel great while using it, soft and moisturized, never sticky or waxy.<br /><br />The real test is at night, when for me, the Vaseline is the only option I could count on to last 8 hours.  I have been very pleased to find the Lip Butter lasts just as long.  My lips feel great in the morning!<br /><br />The tin the Lip Butter comes in is easy to open and close.  However, I'm not a fan of trying to apply products this thick with my finger, because I don't like standing there rubbing and rubbing just to get enough on my finger for suitable application.  Honestly, the tin is large enough that I'm able to put it straight to my lips and apply like a stick balm straight from the tin.  I'd really prefer to have this product in stick form, actually, it would be much easier to apply.<br /><br />Fabulous lip moisturizer, just not thrilled with the method of application.
B000NWOEN4|5|Arrived quickly, works great, my son is blind so I purchased these watches from other companies before, when I get them they never work there dead! My son gets very upset and disappointed! But this company was 100% satisfaction guaranteed thank you!!!!!
B00006BSXM|4|These mouthguards work well for people who grind their teeth at night. However, a couple things you need to know. The size large worked for me. I am 5' 10\\" and 150 pounds, not a large guy. The size small worked for my wife, who is small. The other thing is it takes a bit of practice to get a good fit. You aren't likely to get it right the first time. You might want to buy a pair and figure the first one is just practice. Then, when you have a fit, trim it so it isn't too clunky in your mouth.
B00EALQFJ0|5|interesting fragrance.  like very much.
B00TGW9DY2|5|Like ! Thanks
B00PIMBRKW|5|Love this product!  Gives your skin a youthful glow!
B0015NZ6FK|5|I love love love this sleeping mask, I would not trade it ever for a cheaper one, which I used to use before discover my sleep master eye mask  I would buy from this seller over and over again. This sleep mask is so comfortable lightweight, does not leave marks on your face, and you get what you pay for. I promise you will not be dissappointed
B009AB005U|4|got it for my husband.. not too overpowering which is good!. maybe need 3?? squirts if u want the fragrance to reach before u do :) ... next up get the car and $$$ to match ..LOL!
B002ISXAPY|5|I received a sample of this cologne a little over a month ago and have been using it off and on for several weeks.  First of all, this product is of utmost quality.  A true cologne made with quality ingredients that will not fade after a few hours like many others I have had lately.<br /><br />The aroma at first is a bit intense, there are a lot of top notes.  The most noticed (for me) was the bergamot. The middle notes are more floral and contains the neroli it is named for.  The top and middle notes are short lasting, perhaps 30 minutes to an hour, though hints of them pop up over the course of the whole day as it interacts with your body chemistry.<br /><br />The base notes are beeswax, cedar and a lot of white musk.  The musk specifically is the longest lasting of all the notes in this fragrance.  I put a small short spritz on the back of my neck and it will still be going strong 10 hours later.  It is a very long lasting cologne, I often catch hints of it yet as I'm going to bed at night.  Many of the notes come and go through the day, but the musk will be with you all the way through.  For me at least, it really combined with my own body chemistry to make me smell better rather than completely masking my own scent.  As always, you should try a fragrance before you buy and see how it combines with your own sweat and oils.  Some people can really clash with a fragrance when it soaks into the skin.<br /><br />According to Diptique, this is a unisex fragrance, but I would be hard pressed to imagine something with this much musk in the base notes being attractive on a woman.  On the other hand, my sometimes significant other becomes nearly entranced and ravenous for my attention when she catches a whiff of this from me.  Interestingly enough, she prefers how I smell at the end of the day as opposed to the beginning.  To each their own.
B002MA0GA0|5|Awesome deal!! Great gift
B0000CDVN6|1|This item is very difficult to use. I would not recommend buying it unless you have a lot of time on your hands or are very into hair.
B00699IUFS|5|Wow! finally a lotion that works! Ive tried them all..I may be one of those people that are just hard to tan. But this made me get good and red! Nice smell and it doesn't get gamey smelling after you get out of the bed.
B00T3MTZMK|5|I have always loved this oil, you can get a lot cheaper from amazon then from Avon itself, same smell and same get product, will buy again;)
B0057N3OOY|5|Love the product line!!
B001IAINFU|5|I love this mascara, it looks great and you can take it all off with warm water and washcloth which helps a lot to avoid rubbing eyelids.
B00I4A9PMM|5|I very rarely take the time to write a review but after using revitalash for over a year I felt compelled to write one. This stuff really works!! As others have said it takes a few weeks to see results but give it time, it's worth it.
B000NL0T1G|5|My first safety razor.  Very high materials and manufacturing.  Perfect weight for a great shave.  I never realized how terrible disposable razors are.  Definitely a good investment.  I change blades weekly, and wipe excess soap residue when I change the blade to keep the razor shiny and clean.
B00PUYEQLA|4|I really love the way this serum makes my skin look and feel.
B002O4V4HI|5|Ladies, this is the absolute best mascara ever! I have been using it for years, and nothing else compares. I've tried everything from cheap (why do people rave over Great Lash by Maybelline? It's not all that great!) to very expensive, looking for something similar to this, and I always return to my wash off waterproof mascara.  It does not clump, does not run.  It wears like a waterproof, yet washes off easily with any makeup remover (I use Philosophy's Purity, it does both face and eyes), I don't have to sandblast it off my lashes like other waterproof mascaras.  Nothing else compares, and even other Avon mascaras pale in comparison.  I don't care for Avon's makeup in general, but this mascara is a complete winner.  I always buy on sale, $1.99 a tube, and stock up, in both brown and black. Love it.  Oh, and here's a tip ladies, that I got from a makeup pro: put black on the upper lashes and brown on the lower to add some depth!  It works!  A+ mascara, all the way.  Don't be afraid to try it, you won't regret it!
B00LKSVFI2|3|Have to get to close to focus on 8X
B001T7APMG|5|Got it on time and the price is perfect, I haven't used it yet but I am planning on it
B004M1BO3U|5|The best electronic toothbrush I've had......once I got used to the intense vibrations.
B006OMJ0PO|5|Smells great!
B0016A7CHW|5|My skin is so soft and calm.
B008HV09EQ|5|I tried many time same product from other seller and I had to returned it every time, because bad condicion, defect on products or after couple used they stoped working.  This seller has the best Quality ever, and believe me I'm so picky when I give my review.  Buy it is worth it.
B00NKRZIY8|5|Very good mascara!  Great deal.  Will buy again.  Gone are the days where I spend $ 40.00 plus for department store mascara---when there is really no difference in the quality.  Fooled no more :0  Thank you for a great product!
B001WAKUUC|5|Received product promptly.  Have been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed an improvement on my eyelashes.  Would purchase from this seller again. Ana R
B00MAYS9D4|5|Just what I needed. Great price, well packaged.
B00J12BQEC|4|truly enjoy using this product!
B006ZOENGM|5|I usually don't buy curly wigs but my bf likes curly ones I love the color this color is new for me but hey its always good to change up on ur colors so this is a awesome wig thx a bunch
B00DPE9EQO|3|Not sure I would reorder - from what I can research it doesn't have pure ascorbic acid.
B00A3R2CH4|5|The color looks good on me, i like this BB, it's very lightweight and has a nice texture.
B000PB2XHM|5|The best flat iron you can buy at this or any price!  I owned a Babyliss iron, same model but an older version and it lasted me a good 5 years before I lost it.  It was still in perfect condition.  The porcelain really flattens your hair nicely and the temperature control allows any hair type to be able to use this iron without damaging your hair.  I love it.
B002YXXZQM|3|The handle is too short.  Difficult to hold on to while brushing teeth.  The brush is wonderful and does a great job of making my teeth feel clean.
B009V1P55Y|4|Nice hair for a quick weave.
B000PI2VCM|5|I love this product - it's GREAT if you have fine hair and want volume - it also holds up well in the humidity/ summer.  If you're looking for lift, get this!
B0016POBN0|5|•:*¨¨*:•.♥♥BRILLIANT.•:*¨¨*:•.5 STAR •:*¨¨*:•.THANK YOU!!♥♥.•:*¨¨*:
B0002Z8IB6|3|This soap smells great, but it's too expensive.  Do yourself a favor and buy Camay pink (not rose. Pink).  It smells exactly like this stuff, but it's a lot cheaper.
B00LMIVLXY|4|I use this oil with my flat iron. It makes my hair healthy and a nice shine with it
B001CC1VV2|5|I've been using this daily as a light-duty cleanser for several weeks - and for me, it is truly perfect. I can use a pea-sized amount between my palms, add a little bit of water, and it foams up enough to be used on my entire face and neck.<br /><br />I use a washcloth to steam/wet my face at my sink for a few seconds first. It's pretty thick even when foamy, which is great(!) because it doesn't run into my eyes or down my collar. I wash it off with a washcloth, and my skin immediately feels hydrated and dewy - it isn't shiny, tight, itchy, etc. My skin's always been sensitive to harsh soaps or things with fragrance. I follow this with gokujyn hyaluronic lotion.<br /><br />For makeup, I usually wear just a little concealer and mascara. I wouldn't recommend using this to remove foundation.<br /><br />As an aside, I love how affordable this stuff is! I wish I had discovered it years ago.
B00NPX42JE|5|When I didn't get my package on time, I panicked a little and contacted the seller. The person who assisted me was so nice and explained the situation and when I got the case I fell in love with it. This is definitely a adorable case for a great price.
B00A6FMGRE|5|Love this stuff!!
B002WLWX82|4|Love this hand spa I use it every day and and before bed great product would recommend this to you.
B001IAINFU|5|I was using all kinds of fake eye lashes and switched to this product.  I have no idea HOW they do it, but it creates more and longer lashes.  There are these little tubes/extra lashes that come off when I take off the mascara.  Comes off easy in the shower with soap.  Don't wait for the white part to dry.  You'll love it.  Doesn't dry out, stays smooth and dark...no flakiness!  I want and bought more and stopped the fake eyelashes.
B003LYX3AG|3|Havn't used it yet so don't know. i'll repost more later  but it should be okay.  you get wht you pay for you know?
B004D2C57M|5|careful using it , it will dry your skin. I f you use too much it will burn, but does what it promises. Excellent product.
B004367X70|4|Works good for long hair
B001FWXS0G|5|I have a hard time finding this particular toothpaste.  I can get the white one, but I like the green one (Scope Liquid Gel).
B000FKGSA6|5|I've use this stuff for a few days and it's already my favorite styling product so far.  You don't have to use much, just rub it between your hands and work into your hair, and it holds a general shape for hours without feeling stiff at all.  It has maybe the best smell of American Crew's classic line- smells like the kind of cream they put in donuts and pastries.  It doesn't leave my hair nearly a shiny as I expected, which I'm sort of happy with.  It's a fairly matted look, maybe a little shin.  Might be shinier if I used more, but I doubt I'll ever need to.  Great stuff.
B005JFW1HQ|5|Took away my brassy hue from bleaching at home, and made my hair gorgeously blonde just like I'd been at the hairdresser :) YAY!
B0092MCMM6|4|Very lightweight and seems to be made from a cheap plastic BUT - it works very well and so far, nothing has broken.  I may be just accustomed to the dryers of the old days.......So far, I am happy with the purchase and have used it several times to dry my short relaxed hair.
B004Y99EO6|5|Bought this Waterpik unit for my son who recently got braces- its small enough for him to handle comfortably and powerful enough to do the trick. Doesn't take a lot of counter space either- which was important.<br />He is still using the lowest setting- so we have room to grow with it.<br />Stickers on the water tank are optional- so don't let them dissuade you for use with an older child.
B00I32AN4K|4|Love the way it makes my hair feel. Its a great deep conditioner.
B007DZIB4W|5|This shampoo has an awesome fragrance that my wife loves.  I tried it a couple of times too but it leaves my hair a bit dry...good thing they also make a matching conditioner (same bottle style) to bring back softness.  I recommend this product.
B00IGKBUBE|3|I love serum, but did not like the way this is packaged. Hard to get out. When It seemed empty, I cut off the top and found another week's worth inside.
B0016AADNM|4|This is great especially during the cold and flu season
B00AMTWCOG|5|Quenches my curls
B0018BT9QQ|2|one bottle was half empty, pack was totally not good
B001MN8NKS|4|I baught these hair extensions, they are pretty good. There thinner than I would have expected, I don't expect them to last long but they are good for the moment I guess.
B005Q8CRD4|5|This is my favorite kind of shampoo. No frizz!
B00013TQP6|5|I love listerine pocketpaks. They freshen your breath and leave your mouth feeling super clean. The package is small enough to fit in any clutch or change purse so you can take them anywhere with you. I keep them stashed in the car, my purse, and all over the house. I received a free sample of the listerine pocketpaks for reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.
B002CML1JI|5|I love this stuff. Don't expect miracles, but it definitely will make your skin's cells turn over faster. It's helped keep crows feet away, and kept my fine lines under my eyes from getting worse (actually makes them even less noticeable).
B003FBMFTU|5|Soft Nude: This product is the perfect nude shade. It goes on so smooth in comparison to all of my department store lipsticks. I love the color. It meshes so well with my skin tone. It emphasizes my lips well and doesn't show cracks.<br />It's my favorite lipstick ever. It's a shame that it's been pulled by Revlon! I feel like I should've gotten more than one to save for when I run out.
B00OVG34ZC|5|Love it!  I lke that  it's organic, first of all, and it's the smoothest, cleanest, most viscous castor oil ever.  I use it sparingly on my eyelashes and on my hands.
B00ID8H86K|4|Works great heat wise but hair gets caught in small gap between eating plates and the pink part of the flat iron. Occasionally pulls some hairs out.
B007SNGSFS|5|Fast delivery and great price!
B00067UYY4|5|I recommend REJUVACOTE and MIRACOTE/BRUSH&GO very highly. These products are excellent. I never used to have strong nails and had acrylics put on for years. Now I have long, strong, beautiful nails.  You will love them. Buy together for best results!<br />LG
B001MIZMP2|5|I really like the smell of this product, it not too strong.  The convince of 3 in 1 is also great.
B001EAYZEW|5|very beautiful and works well! it has two speed modes.
B00CPHD29W|3|I gave this a 3 because i got many compliments on it, but the headband broke easily after only a few hours of wear.  It looks like it is just superglued or something.  I will try to put it back together with needle and thread.
B00DGY0QMY|5|The duo is not available in the UK so I had to buy it on Amazon. Coupled with my T-Zone Pore Refining Serum by Murad, the regimen gives the best results I've ever had in maintaining clear and blackhead-free pores especially on the nose!
B00BZIATBQ|5|Love the product.
B002I4Z6TG|5|good flat iron.  also dual voltage which is a big benefit for those who travel.  easy to use and accurate temperature.
B006EBISP8|5|Very strong hold with very little shine. Leaves your hair with a mat finish. A little tough to wash out though.
B0015NZ6FK|4|Works well and is pretty comfy. Blocks out all light.
B0067BAIM6|5|lots of power the wife was happy
B000LQGQSI|3|It's easy to shut the iron off by accident because of the placement of the button.<br />You can easily shut it off by accident and then go back to make another curl, then it will have already cooled down by then. Other than that, it works ok.
B001M7QLSA|4|If you are not used to tube mascara, then this stuff can be a bit odd. Unlike normal mascara, this type of mascara literally forms a tube around each eyelash. You have to be careful when putting it on, make sure and separate between coats, but if you do it right you will end up with long, gorgeous lashes. It does take a little extra time, about twice what I normally spend doing my mascara, just because it is two different layers and I brush my lashes in between them. If you sleep in your mascara (I know, don't do it!), you will end up with outrageous clumps in the morning, and it is slightly harder to take off than normal mascara, so keep that in mind. I use this for special occasions when I need the extra length and drama.
B004D248JA|4|I love how moisturizing this lotion is.  It is smooth and creamy and goes on evenly. I've used this one for about 4 years now.  The only thing I dislike really isn't anything to do with the lotion, but the cap breaks easily.  I believe I've only had one cap that hasn't broken in the past four years.
B004INUWX0|5|I love love love this thing! I have long very curly hair and have battled my whole life with what am I going to do with my hair today?? It takes me about an hour and a half normally to straighten it - so most of the time it's in an up-do. Now I just wash my hair - brush it, let it air dry about 15- 20 min, then I use this new brush and voila! It gives me gorgeous super shiny straight hair that I can flip out or curl under. I can't remember the last time my hair looked so healthy. No more round brush and blow dryer going at the same time using up both hands trying to reach the ends of my hair at the back!!! NOTE>it does take some getting used to but I found my grove with it after about 10 minutes. You get used to where the buttons are.
B0043RBXYI|4|Used this product for years. Smells great.
B006PKVYIQ|5|I never thought I'd pay over $3 for a shower cap, but I'm so glad I did.  These have held up to everything my kids have thrown at them and still look great!
B000FQ5H02|5|BUY IT!!!<br /><br />Super fresh and clean feel and scent.  This is what aftershave needs to be.<br />Slightly lemon-y scent, not *too* astringent, but gets the job done.<br />If you live where its humid this stuff is the killer face app!
B007BSA5ZO|5|I loveee this palette! It's very pigmented and has enough colors to play with. I got it on time and in very good shape. I absolutely recommend this product! :)
B003VMXQLO|5|Great product and an amazing colour!
B00NFVAHE0|5|100% best lotion ever used. I am a fan of tattoos ( I have multiple) so unscented lotion isn't a stranger to me. with that being said my skin was like a dry sponge with this lotion ....until I put it on my skin (arms legs even my face) I wasn't aware that It was even dry until I felt how soft it was afterwards. I received this in an influenster box but I will continue to buy it after I run out!
B000AN1JEI|5|The best.   Forgot to mention: the glued-on paper over the case was totally annoying and frustrating to remove. Very troublesome.
B00366LKOA|5|This is one of my favorite polishes when I want to have a nude color. The best way I can describe it is that it's a very soft pink with a hint of copper. I have a medium skin tone and this color almost matches it. The polish has a frosted sheen. The only downside with this color is that you or whoever is applying it on has to be pretty good since the color easily shows brush strokes.
B001G7PZVK|5|I have a long family history of eye problems.<br /><br />Take it from me, this is as good an eyelid cleanser as you'll find. These wipes may seem less economical than the foam sprays, but trust me they are more affordable. The foam sprays lose their reactivity after 70 percent through the bottle, and often the spray head is worn out by then and also the foam comes out in a useless liquid. Plus, these wipes don't have the highly corrosive chemistry that the foams have. They are gentle, and although they don't have the clean sensation that accompanies something that is burning your flesh, they do a better job removing eye buildup.<br /><br />Buy one pack and test them out, you won't regret it.
B002AMUFJC|5|I LOVE It !
B002Q3CGC4|5|I had previously given this item 3 out of 5 stars but after using it for more than a month, it is a 5 out of 5! This is the best leave in conditioner that I have ever used. Yes, it takes some time to get used to the smell but it is so worth it. My hair is the softest it has ever been and you can really feel the change. This product does not control frizz or give any type of styling aid but it leaves your hair so soft. I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry, over processed hair.
B009GEUPDS|5|I really loved this product. I was given a sample of it, so I wasn't sure what I was going to think. But I have to say, I'm loving it. My face has never been so smooth. The vibrating brushes are like a mini face massage. My face felt fresh and clean the entire day.
B00756HQNQ|5|great
B001183N8G|5|Good color, no chemically odor, & doesn't make your skin feel greasy. I definitely recommend putting it on at night then rinsing the guide color of the next morning.
B0055O64VU|5|These teeth whitening strips really work and have not irritated my gums.  They're really easy to use and stronger than the usual whitening strips you buy over the counter.  And a lot cheaper than buying them at the dentist.
B005IJTKFY|5|ONE OF THE BEST!<br /><br />I really like this creme. A little expensive but it really works. Does not stain your white clothes. Might have to get use to the smell but you totally see the difference on skin tone within a week or less.
B000OLAIMA|5|My wife loves to travel with this stuff, it fizzes your teeth clean, has a pleasant flavor, & is easy to use.
B0037TM252|3|It might need longer time or it's just me, but the hair is still coming down as usual and what's not there is still not there. I didn't expect a miracle, but there's just no change whatsoever.
B00005333G|4|I am 22 years old and I have sensitive skin. My skin dries out and I get hives a lot. Since I have been using this stuff I haven't had nearly as many problems with my sensitivity and my skin feels great. I have tried all kinds of moisturizers and have found a lot of disappointment. I bought this Hyrda Renewal earlier this week and I have been getting compliments since the day I first tried it. It doesn't smell the best but it works great. I would steer away from using a lot though. Its a little on the shiny side but it makes a great base for powder. I just dab a little powder on my nose and a little to the sides under my eyes and I look great! I don't feel like I need to use makeup to make my skin look better now.    I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it feels kind of greasy and looks slightly greasy/shiny. (I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I had the option)I know it is supposed to make you look radiant or whatever but it's just a little too much.  If you can get over that and just dab your face with a dry towel or light powder, it really works well and makes your skin feel soft and healthy. The benefits significantly outweigh the one fault that I have found.
B0009OAISQ|5|FAST DELIVERY. GREAT VALUE. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. WILL ORDER AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER.
B008XMZAB6|5|These are unlike any headband I have ever worn.  They stay in place, don't leave a crease in your hair and your head doesn't feel like it's wrapped in a tight band.  I have thick, curly hair and was surprised that the band held my hair back as well as it did.  when I go to the gym, I use one of their hair ties as well as the band; perfect combination to keep my shoulder length hair out of my face.<br />Only negative I have to say is I wish they were available in more neutral colors and shades and possibly some colors, too.
B002BGDLDO|5|great to use when using false lashes...holds until you take off...a must have when wearing falsies...better than all the rest in my opinion
B0015K9BXQ|5|Much easier than the old clippers I got used to using since I was in the service.
B008MG5QPI|5|Tastes good.
B002PBC9Y2|4|I purchased this when I could no longer find the conditioner that I had found very light, yet strengthening.  This one has a heavier feel and doesn't seem to completely rinse out.  However, it leaves my thin, straight and somewhat brittle hair shiny, sleek, bouncy and still strong.  The scent is mild, and it only requires a dime sized amount to completely treat my shoulder length hair.  I follow conditioning with the Loreal product with a dilute apple cider vinegar rinse, and so far, I am pleased with the performance of the Loreal conditioner and will purchase again.
B0035LCW7U|5|Love it
B0044FPUKC|5|This algae masque works wonders on my skin. I have been using it for two weeks and I am really amazed to see so much improvement. First of all I love the skin color. The fact that my pores have shrunk make me very happy. My skin seems lifted and younger looking.  I use it ones a day, at least three times a week, and I like to leave it on for about 45 minutes, as I put a generous amount on, and like for it to dry longer. This way it works longer on the skin. I surely recommend this treatment for anyone and especially for those with sagging skin around the cheeks area.
B0012GXAY4|4|Good product:-)
B00FO7TRMG|5|Best thing for my heels.
B00079YDG6|5|So clean and clear.  Such a long-lasting, lively frangrance.  Stays all day and, with a spritz, goes into the evening.  Very crisp.  Makes me feel as if I'm at the beach without the coconut smell.  Flowery without being any particular flower strong.  I wear it generally every day and consider it worth every nickel.  I've worn it since the early 90s and have had people stop me to ask what it is and where did I get it.  Do I think your wife would like it?  Yes I do.
B004N13NEW|5|I'm using Icon products since 2 years: my hair is stonger and longer. Perfect for dry and curly or wavy hair. Also I love the delicate smell of moringa.
B0036U16GS|5|Makes My Hair so manageable.  I used to have dry frizzy hair....the top of my hair is naturally wavy, the bottom curly...This makes my hair beautiful!!  Wish I would have found it years ago.  I love my natural hair now!
B002WTC38O|5|I have very thin hair, nails and eyelashes.  I first bought this on a whim, just to try it out.  Well, it REALLY does work.  Takes a few weeks or so....I apply it to the &#34;liner&#34; area on the top of my lashes, and lately I have been putting it &#34;under&#34; my lower lashes, and wow....now my lower lashes are longer than I have ever had in my life.  I have really seen a definite difference.  When I forget, or stop using, my lashes end up back to where I was, and then I am very sorry that I forgot, because it will take a few weeks to get them back.  Best if used before bed, then it has all night to sit there on your skin, next to the root of the lashes, with no make-up or anything to get in the way.  If I forget to apply at night, I put it on in the morning, as it is clear.  Just be careful not to put any eyeshadow over it, or the shadow will just absorb it, and not work.  I love this serum, and will continue to buy!!
B001WWUUBY|5|I love my bare mineral kit.  It looks that I'm not wearing make up at all.  It's very light, and won't clog your pores.  Makes your face look radiant, and very natural.  I love the fact that it comes with two different shades of foundation, that you can combine to get a more acurate natural look.  Plus the brushes are absolutely perfect.  Another thing that I love about it is that I can cover dark circles under my eyes with it, and it looks so natural.
B001WX0F86|4|Works well
B00KLA4INE|5|its a very excellent product for fine lines & wrinkles each time i use the derma roller my skin feels and looks so much better. My face has a youthful appearance with a radiant even tone.
B0079OB5UE|1|Super small, very disappointed with the sizes of the kit. The three pieces sizes are as below: 5ml, 5ml, and 15ml.
B00S48YZ4C|5|I own 2 other beard combs and this one is my favorite. Smells good and the teeth have just the right spacing for my beard. Cloth pouch could be better as mine has the stitching coming apart on the one side. Don't really use the pouch anyhow but it could be more durable.
B004EZPYR6|5|Great smell, nice thick lather, and has great slickness, all around great cream, and for the money it's hard to say no to such a wonderful product.
B0018YZ7NW|1|I used the color endure with sulphates and loved this shampoo,  and that is the one I ordered. This formulation without sulphates is awful.  I hate this product, strips the hair of life and gives it a weighted down feeling like straw.  I can't find the older version but this one is a waste of money. I had no idea this was a different formulation as the name is the same and the packaging, online, looks identical. The product came in about a week late and by that time I was out of shampoo so I had to use it but it is a waste of money.
B00EHQOQGM|5|Love water decals, so easy to apply. I love the selection here and could see using some of them as a wrap on a naked nail because  there is so much design you can't see much of the polish. But there is a nice mix of accents in there too! Loved these! ill reorder! Oh and the sizes are great, too! 10 of each, the largest I can use on my big toe, then the other four I use on my hand, leaving my middle or index finger free.
B009LAW0XK|4|Nothing special here, however, it's available in Costco stores, twin pack, for $10.
B0000Y8H3S|5|Item be as describe
B00KMMRJD2|5|Good product and GREAT supplier.  We had a minor issue on delivery and so we emailed them.  They fixed the issue immediately.  Tools work well and we are happy.
B0067H6JHS|4|Love the way this cleans the skin and has a pleasant smell to boot. Can easily get into your mouth causing a gross taste (hence the 4 stars). I have noticed a difference in my skin and received compliments, and the changes occurred within the first week or so of use!
B0056GDG90|5|Pleased with the performance
B001KYQBUI|5|Light fragrance....just a hint of aroma, fresh smell.  Love it in the summer as my &#34;go to&#34; fragrance.  Don't mind it getting on my clothes because of the soft scent.
B00GJ4X3MI|3|These are very pretty brushes,but the eyeshadow brushs was either to big or to small and were flat and hard.The bigger brushes were softer.I did send them back.
B005OJ4PL2|5|great product! perfect for my combination skin. however, it is only 21.50$ on origins website so I don't know why it is being sold for so much here.
B00Q2MYUHO|4|For those saying this scent is not very strong, and it lacks any smell, I ask you which product you have purchased?  I got this shaving gel on a great deal for my husband, and I thought since it was &#34;scent less&#34; I could maybe use it too.  I discovered that I do not enjoy going around with smooth legs that smell like a man.
B001RVFC4U|3|The spray is okay, butr once sprayed in the shower, the smell and effect disappears quite rapidly. I won't order it again.
B00DTR1WGW|3|Shipping took a very long time. Product is fine.
B0030ZRSHK|5|Great product. Beats having to spend $100 plus for the same thing I can do right at home. Product works quickly and efficiently.
B00GCSLV70|5|It's styptic pencil. Does what it should.
B004FNKHO2|5|This stuff is awesome, it's the only thing that clears up my eczema within a days time.
B004IMAELQ|5|perfect match to my ponytail hair piece.  I love bangs but don't always want them.
B000XEB2BO|5|This perfume smells like fresh flowers! Beautiful as a gift to yourself n that special someone. 😍
B00008MOQF|5|Over many years I've tried dozens of different mascaras including many expensive brands.  I've never found one that works as well for me as this old standby.  It's no wonder that this one frequently shows up on top ten lists of best mascaras.  Can't be beat for the price.
B006RLK970|5|I chose this glue because I heard and read good reviews. I must say I like it so far and will place another order. I like the fact that it came with the extra bag.
B004INUWX0|5|I bought for a friend because she felt in love wen she tried the one I had already bought for myself!!
B001CWP726|5|Buy this and you will not be sorry.<br />Best flat iron ever.<br />Smooth glide and temperature control.<br />The temperature control is VERY valuable in varying weather conditions.
B001QT5FMM|4|I like Aveeno because is smells good and feels clean
B002NPB8F6|5|Product was great
B004VFXVJW|3|It works, and does not fog up, but the size is a little too small for me. If it was about 30% larger, it would be perfect.
B00GIEK804|3|Easy to use, But did not stay on as long as the Sally Hansen product that I had used before. Good price, fast service.
B0006O11V2|5|same comment as I wrote before. It has a very healing effect if you have chafing in some places. Use it every evening after washing the area and apply &#34;FREI Oel&#34;.
B001DYI176|5|One of the best products I've ever used on my hair.  The whole line is wonderful.
B00GNKLEKG|5|Works well and holds firmly on an uneven surface when screwed in
B00NR1YQHM|5|This gel really boosts your skin moisture content.  I used it for a couple of days before my wife spotted it and made off with it.  She's in her late 40's and she says it really worked well.  We don't ge much sun so product like this work really well for us.<br /><br />I recommend this as a cost-effective moisture boosting gel.
B000XE961C|5|Great Mother's Day gift. Has a very distinct scent that I will recommend to others. Very easy to apply to your skin as well.
B008CT12G2|3|I really wanted to see some improvement, but it's just not happening.  I guess I've been using this for six weeks or so, but no change in undereye circles or any lift in upper lids.  I've used Olay Regenerist products for several years, and can't say I really saw any difference in my eye area with them either, so maybe an earlier reviewer was right that there is simply not much that will effect change in the eye area, but I'll keep trying!
B00HVKAV0Q|5|It was amazing, made my hair really light and gorgeous!
B0018CJ2PI|4|I ordered this because it looks like a nice, soft, pastel pink in the picture.  What I received is a pepto-bismol colored hot pink - bordering on fuschia.  It's an okay color, but since I am in my 40's - not my teens - I would have preferred the soft pink.<br />* UPDATE * I have upped my rating to a 4 for this product.  It's not the color pictured, but it does stamp as a pretty pink color.  Now that I've used it a few times, I'm actually glad the color was darker.  I think a paler pink would not show up as nicely as this color does.  I would give it 5 stars, but I think the picture is misleading, and I dislike that because when I place an order, I expect to get exactly what is pictured.  I've uploaded a picture of the bottle I received - hope you find it helpful in deciding about the color.
B00006IV2F|5|This was a gift for my daughter and she says it works really well.
B002TTN7RS|5|I have wrinkled eyebrows so I can't wear anything but matte eyeshadows. These are hard to find in stores, so this is prefect.  It is great for travel. Buy it now.
B006ZCPZMA|4|I haven't had any of the problem mentioned in other reviews... it rolls without any catching, it does produce a very mild stinging - but isn't that what sticking needles into your skin does?! So far, it's exactly what I expected.
B001G5FOLI|5|Pretty good and very sharp. I use these every other day in my Merkur holder to trim my lower neck and upper cheeks around my beard.
B003NCTQW0|1|I ordered brushes and in a carrying case and I received a make up carrying case for travel. Now I have a case that I  don't need and no new brushes.
B00005AUIE|2|These razors dull very quickly compared to my Schick razors.  I used to be able to shave my legs 3 - 4 times with the Schick.  The Venus blade kind of dies after two shaves and if you use it in the armpit area after the leg, it is rather uncomfortable.
B0073RQMXC|5|Exelent hydro 5 good price to
B000V3QH2G|5|I had pool dry chlorine hair for a while and this conditioner really made it back to normal, made a big difference and I like my soft silky hair again!  All natural, try it you will be happy that it works as well as chemical formulas! Thank goodness for organic products and companies like this that use really natural products not just labeling it natural but if you look at the ingredients its full of petrochemical derived chemicals.
B000VFWV4W|5|Mary Kay products are the best I have ever used. I will be buying more when I use all of this hydrating gel. Love it
B001I90NEA|4|I love Aquaphor as a product. We use it as lip balm on our lips. However, the tube that it comes in is not &#34;lip balm&#34; friendly. I thought I was purchasing the one with the rounded tip, however, this is literally just a tube. The opening is large and flat. You have to squeeze it onto your finger first. It's hard to use it directly on your lips. If you're looking for the lip balm version, this is not it!
B00AFV4NQQ|5|I could not believe how well this conditioner works.  I usually hate to use conditioner, so I normally don't use it.  I decided to try this one and was amazed.  It made my hair really soft, easy to brush, and seems to be stronger.  Only issue is that it doesn't smell very good.  I wish it came as a 2 in 1.
B001MA0QY2|5|Love this hair straightener. I have puffy, curly, wavy hair and using this straightener with argan oil makes my hair soft and straight. I use to own an infinity flat iron and it worked well, until the spring broke and now it doesn't hold itself up. I bought this one because of all the good reviews and 40 bucks seemed like a reasonable price. I've had it for a week and I love it! The only down side is that it doesn't have auto shut off and it has a brand new smell that doesn't seem to go away but that doesn't bother me. :)
B000J3FNJG|5|This is by far the best shampoo  I have  ever used. Leaves your hair soft & shiny and smells so clean & fresh. Great for curly dry hair.
B007WKKKI8|5|Best Sunscreen Ever
B00AGG3MNU|5|Obviously have to find the best blade for ones own self and that's what I did here.  Most gentle on my skin.  No other brand compares
B0011UR1H8|5|Classic! You will love everything about this product, the bronzer is awesome. I like to tan with this lotion when I'm going somewhere afterwards. But as with any bronzer wearing white and then getting mad it rubbed off is silly. Well duh! I get good color with this.
B00DZIR03O|5|This clarifying shampoo is awesome. I don't like to wash my hair every day so I frequently use dry shampoo. All this product can build up in my hair but this shampoo gently detoxes my scalp leaving it super clean but not stripped. The only downside that I could see is that it is minty, which might not appeal to everyone. Plus order it off iristree.com for free shipping!
B0049LUI9O|5|Everyone in my immediate vicinity loves this thing and they don't even know it.  Thanks Panasonic for my new friends.
B00BBJ4DLQ|1|Not happy with the way they were packaged not individually or sterilized, once a package a handful were in were open they would become unsterilized while trying to hunt for correct tip to be used! Will not purchase again!!
B001OA4G14|2|Used this twice and had to throw out the rest of the sample. This morning I looked in the mirror only about 5 to 8  minutes after putting it on and my entire face looked shiny and too much like an oil slick. Had to wash it off immediately. Too bad, because I loved the smell, ingredients list and the texture of it. This may work as a night serum for some people, but I like to use lightweight serums as daytime moisturizers.
B000UQ546Y|3|I like the variety but the quality of the combs isn't great, they're pretty thin. Would serve well for home use but not great for professional salon use...I'm thinking they'll eventually get softened by regular Barbicide use.
B00TIX0Z7I|3|I was disappointed in these. I was looking for a pair of SHARP clippers and these aren't. They work OK on nails but aren't sharp enough to cleanly clip cuticles.
B000VKV29M|5|Have had this 1.5 years and it works well. Has five trim settings, usually use #4 setting.  Use it with my moustache, sideburns, trim around ears, and trim head hair which reduces frequency of going for a $25 haircut.  Recommend.
B003F62G3U|5|Takes the red cheeks look down a few notches...
B000JNQSIQ|5|Pretty good
B002KGW6VI|3|its not as opaque as i like and doesnt last that much, i prefer the stila one
B0069ZX0TS|5|Well packaged product and quick response from the seller.  The tooth brush set has travel box to put away and protect tooth brush. The toothbrush is also very useful in cleaning my teeth.
B00A0IWRT4|5|I bought the shampoo and conditioner together and Im very happy with this purchase. I have course, dry hair and the set make my hair feel very nice. I would definitely recommend this product.
B008QMWV7E|5|Got in on a 3 pack for six bucks, can't complain on the price and the quality of the product is nice as well. I still use Cutemol for extreme dry skin cases, but this is good for now and then uses.
B0006GZCVK|4|Switched to this conditioner a year or so ago and I'll never go back! Smells great and does amazing things to my hair!
B004Z2NPK6|5|My new favorite color and formula.
B00JCZTDFC|5|Perfect for me
B00F6429K4|5|I got my nails done and fell in love with this color. It is straight up sparkly coral. A rosy coral. Great summer color.
B0076PPTJ4|5|Perfect
B00BQK5GMU|1|Bad quality. Scissor is dull. I guess you get what you pay for.
B0009OAGRY|5|My wife ordered this for me as a gift, it is my favorite! She did a great job, I wear this every day.
B00D879BFW|2|I'm not sure if this even works, sometimes I see some dead skin being removed, other times I think I didn't put a thick enough layer on and all those white spots are the holes that I couldn't cover.  Maybe I'm just not putting it on right?  I can say that it is slightly painful to take off, but I got used to it after a while.  It did get rid of all the baby hairs on my face.  It didn't remove any blackheads for me though.
B000NL0T1G|5|I will never go back!<br /><br />There is a learning curve with these safety razors, that's a given. But if you do your research, take your time and follow the rules of shaving, you'll do just fine. I've been using mine for a few weeks now and have yet to cut myself. This little gem is fantastic and makes the learning curve super easy. It feels super solid (solid metal) has a great heavy weight feel to it (compared to plastic razors) that gives it a high end elegant presence.<br /><br />Swapping blades is a synch as is cleaning when necessary. Take your time while shaving and this little beauty will do all the work for you.<br /><br />If you're thinking of swapping for whatever reason (save money, try some new/better) but are afraid you're going to hack your face to pieces, don't be. I was too, but I checked out some tutorials on youtube, learned a few techniques and dove right in and was very surprised at how simple it was.
B00SG7BGYS|1|Easy to fill but it leaked out all over my purse. A very expensive waste of Estee Lauder Sensuous Noir.
B001MA0QY2|5|I have just a wave in my long hair but this product straightens it in no time and really gets the frizz out.  Easy to use and great for the price, have reccomended to my curley haired girls and friends!!!  It comes with oil, love it.
B0052P0XIC|5|I love this face wash.  I struggled with perioral dermatitis for a long time and conventional soaps and face washes would aggravate it terribly.  This is NOT a normal face wash.  It does not foam (no SLS), and you have to rub it in to make it an effective remover of makeup.  It smells awesome and I really do think the probiotics helped to calm the rash on my face.  I have continued to order this product for the last 3 years and don't see myself stopping any time soon.
B00NO8DT2G|5|I received this lip balm as a gift, the flavor variety pack and I love it!!!! The Asian pear is my favorite, but all flavors are great! I love that it is all natural and made in the U.S.A!!!! I will absolutely purchase this again and again!!!!!
B00JLPM8AK|1|It is not working!!Makes the skin very dry.
B00U0H45YA|5|Avena proport is marbles , at first week using it started feel the changes my hair looks more Chine  and strong... I love it.
B008510498|5|I recently cut my hair really short after many years and was looking for some extentions that were good quality and not too expensive so i found these on Amazon an decided to take the risk. And i'm so glad i did bc they look so natural and i get complements all the time..! I soo recomend this!!
B001MA0QY2|5|I'm extremely impressed with this product and how well it works for the cheap price that I bought it
B00B9QUDZG|5|I got this so my dad could shave.  He is bed ridden now so this really came in handy.  He uses this every day to shave.
B00BT7V4DA|5|Super good!
B001GS6OB4|1|I was not able to use it in any angle maybe someone more por than me can! I am just so happy I was able to return it for free. Thanks Amazon:)
B00CC6XSSQ|5|Great for travel. I grab one anytime I travel for work and just throw it away when I leave the hotel. I wouldn't use these for my &#34;everyday&#34; at home brush though, they are cheap and the bristles are very stiff.
B002Y3TD72|4|Got my money's worth. I've always used Denman brushes and it is nice to have one with alittle color to it.  Works great.
B00T6IHQOK|5|My sensitive skin loves this bar!  It is soothing and calming to my skin and the light scent doesn't bother my allergies.  I'm thrilled to have found it.  The bumps on the top of my back are gone.
B0014F5EVK|5|i used this all the time . spray everywhere so they dont come. and i didnt see them no more. keep spraying so the eggs will be killed too.
B008JWW5K4|3|Smells weird. Soft and nice to use. But the case smells weird.
B003U80TAU|5|I love this product!!! I use it with coconut oil and my skin is finally clear. tried everything, and my coworker told me about this and it is a miracle product. Seller was fast too! Thanks!!
B005E2YO7E|5|I love all things MAC, and this nail polish is beautiful, black with gold flakes, and it turns a camo green in the sun! I love it.
B004ZWJCPI|5|That is what it is - A Groomer - adjustable length via clip on combs from 'Stubble' (2 mm, .079\\")to 'Long' (12 mm, .71\\")<br />This is not Razor, even with the foil shaver head just a little fuzz can be felt - but for trimming your beard to getting that close clean look and feel of your private regions - nick free if used correctly - this is the razor for you<br />Cord less Lithium-Ion but NOT WATER PROOF, can't be used in the shower. I read nowhere about using shaving cream of gel - but I do us just small amount of 'NIVEA for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel' to get that little extra smooth glide.<br />Really like this one, all the features at a great price from one of the top makers of hair grooming products. Would recommend to a friend or anyone looking for a cordless trimmer but again 'NOT WATERPROOF'!!  Phillip
B00DSQZL9I|5|Awesome!!! Gives hair more texture and makes it easier to style and hold!!
B00E6PDO2G|5|Really a great product.
B007L5IB0I|5|Great for fine hair. Adds volume. Much cheaper than salon and even stores.
B00FTG6YLY|5|This product is pretty good. Does a good job at hydrating sensitive skin. I actually like the whole line. Bought it for the first time at CVS when I was in the mood for trying something different.
B00JEZ9CF6|5|Love this color. Finally found it.
B00D9NV2D4|5|This item was delivered to me along with 2 Shea butter products which I also loved . I used it as a daily moisturizer mixed with an other oil . I feel that me hands are softer and better looking.
B00D3VWODY|1|Yes
B000JLFFGE|5|Loved it. The brush is just what I was looking for to replace a brush 50 yrs old brush.  I could use a couple more but the postage just isn't worth it.  Had I know if I could have gotten a couple more for the same postage that would have been good.
B0024GT9NC|5|Great stuff. Helps keep heels soft.  My sister recommended it.  My husband and I both use it now.
B004K3D0FK|5|Great product and price
B00LIBEBTG|5|Very happy with brush. It is stimulating and invigorating. Nice product.
B007822G8W|5|The consistency of the PTR Laser Free Regenerator Gel Cream is very different from anything I have used before.  It's definitely \\"gel like\\" but it goes on so smoothly!  It leaves NO greasy residue on my face.  It soaks in very fast and doesn't leave me with an oily mess.  In the morning, I use it after my PTR serum and before my SPF moisturizer [[ASIN:B002MSN3QQ Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]].  My skin is smoother and glows.  I was skeptical but so glad I gave it a try.  Definitely recommended!  I will be trying more PTR products.
B00U0PABWW|5|The description was very accurate and it looks amazing!
B00EMKQ7QA|5|works great!  but expensive to me.
B000674XNM|5|My go to product for my outside corner of eyes.
B00ZZ0VMB6|5|Great! The satisfaction it gives is unexpected.
B00WYWR8O8|2|This product has potential however there may be more bad than good. I wish I would have taken a before and after pic because you never really know if there was a change in this short amount of time. I did like how this product made my skin feel.<br /><br />The cons:  This product should not be in a pump type bottle. It specifically said shake and when I did that and then pumped it on my fingers it came out with a lot of bubbles and air. Sometimes it would even squirt of my hand. I feel like this should be in a bottle with a dropper or something along those lines.
B004Y9H1QO|5|Ordered this for my neice who's mom doesn't let her wear makeup. It's not heavy or waxy looking it actually gives her a tiny bit of hue on her lips which looks very natural. No one's ecwn noticed she wears it so I guess that's a good thing. Overall cery satisfied with this product. Definitely recommend.
B00EYVRX0Q|5|Seriously, it's SPF plus amazing coverage. I no longer feel the need to cake on foundation and concealer. And it protects my skin - so there's hardly anything to cover up now anyway.<br /><br />Just awesome.
B00ICQ0XHO|5|Excellent product
B00DUMR6CK|5|since i have been using it my hair is no longer dry and lifeless and much more manageable. thats what im looking for.
B001ET77O8|5|This is a wonderful soap. It is refreshing and can be used for many things. It is true that you can brush your teeth with it. It doesn't taste or feel bad. I also use it to wash bras and underwear by hand. I love the smell and so did my grand kids. I am hooked on this soap. Once you try it you won't want the regular kinds.
B002O8N1MA|2|So disappointed with this product. One liner lasted for one day only - disintegrated in my mouth. Effective for about 2 hours -until I ate something. Paid $45 dollars  - too much. Amazon prime didn't cover the shipping.
B0052NTBFK|3|I bought the carrot roller and I wasnt impressed. I guess I was hopeful especially since I bought it for $10 and it was $20 in the drugstore. I dont see any improvement in my skin though.
B007Q254WY|4|As described no complaints
B00140RYAO|4|This is a great product for smoothing  your hair  - takes all the electricity out and promotes nice styling.
B001OGL94U|5|Good Price and smells good.
B008YQM44C|1|If you like the taste of Hydrogen Peroxide, you may like it! It left the need to spit repeatedly. Sorry for such a bad review but it wasn't for me. I threw the bottle away!!!
B0043ZLTDU|4|Over the years I have used mouthwash most every day. For the most part I've used either Scope or Listerine. Both mouthwashes are good and have a refreshing flavor. However, when I have used Scope over a period of time I no longer have quite the feeling of freshly-cleaned at the dentist teeth that I have with Listerine. And, when I have gone for cleanings, I've had more plaque buildup when I've been using Scope than with Listerine. As I said, Scope is okay and deserves a four-star rating. However, for me, Listerine works better.
B004JK7I6G|1|I bought a bottle of Tokyo Milk Dark Excess from FAT CUPID. First off, the perfume came unboxed. It was just wrapped in a scrap of cardboard. Also, the bottle did not match my other bottle of their perfume - It had a shiny heat shrink label covering it. The real bottles are made of matte black glass with the graphics printed directly on them. The scent was 100% different from the scent of the tester I tried at a local store (I would have bought it there, but they only had the tester in stock). The real scent was very rich and earthy, and like all Tokyo Milk products, it lasted. The perfume I bought from FAT CUPID smelled like watered down Old Spice cologne.<br />When I contacted the seller, they did nothing, so I filed a claim with Amazon, and they gave me a credit for the purchase price. While I appreciate the credit, I wonder if they're doing anything to stop the sale of counterfeit products on their site. This seems like a pretty common thing on here.
B00MPBP1OC|5|I have Lupus and have started wearing UV protecting. I love this hat. It keeps my head cool and my face protected. I can roll the brim up or down. I can sit it differently on my head and it has a draw string for fitting in the hat. It looks stylish and I wear it in the pool. It dry's rather fast and holds it's color. It looks good with sunglasses a would go with casual dress or swimming attire.<br />I am happy I purchased this hat. I wished it came in different colors.
B00LPZ9F1E|5|i love the veil its perfect for my grandaughters wedding on april, but like expected we will have to steam it straight so dont buy thinking you will be able to pull it out the box and wear. but 5 out of 5 over all perfect simple veil for my grandaughter
B00PJYQ8JO|5|I use the antiaging mask pretty regularly.  Very happy with it!  My son can not go without the anti acne!  Love this product.
B00A18JLEC|5|was good
B005MEYV0E|5|The volume is actually 6.7 fl oz. Nevertheless, it's a legitimate product. It came as a gift set where the shower gel was included, an unexpected and pleasant surprise. It's a great cologne.
B00JLPM8AK|5|I was skeptical. I've never been one to waste money on the latest beauty trend. I've erred on the side of practicality and acceptance of the aging process. At 45-years-old, I splurged. Whoa! I'm incredibly happy with the results. My skin appears brighter and healthier. I no longer wear foundation or concealer. After 23 years of marriage, my hubby comments -- for the first time ever -- on the youthful appearance of my skin. He said I sparkled. No joke. He had no idea that I was experimenting with this fountain of youth.
B00DPE9EQO|1|Well, used 3 bottles during the course of months. But this did not do anything at all, and it's actually drying rather than moisturizing. I suspect it doesn't take good on everyone's individual skin based on the reviews. Caution buying this as some magic potion, it may not do any more than sugar water for you! Cannot recommend this based on price and the reviews did not hold up. Bad batch? Is this probably easily damaged in heat during shipping? No idea, but didn't work for me.<br /><br />I found this post about this product to be interesting but I haven't investigated the authenticity of the claims yet:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R9EULQRDU72AE/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&asin=B00DPE9EQO&cdForum=Fx34KL5WC7DA3TX&cdMsgID=MxXK2S2V6QG17Z&cdMsgNo=1&cdPage=1&cdSort=oldest&cdThread=TxM42KU375YMRO&store=beauty#MxXK2S2V6QG17Z
B0096BQKVM|5|I was trying out perfumes at my local Macy's and came across this one.  All I can say is WOW!  I really haven't used perfumes since Guess Gold went discontinued, just been using body sprays/splashes. I had to hurry and grab this one, so much more cheaper here on Amazon than in retail stores. Dolce & Gabbana Pour Femme smells so enticing, sexy and sensual!!!!!  By far the best Dolce & Gabbana yet!!!
B00HBAM1N6|4|I am really noticing thicker eyebrows and lashes.  IMO this works just as well as rapidbrow, but much cheaper.
B000P27CKY|5|I will be  re odering a second  becuz I love it so much great smell and ty for having at such a great price
B001ET77P2|5|My husband's favorite soap.  He loves it.  It's the only one he ever uses.
B008UOZ1D4|3|The bangs are QUITE thick and wavy and choppy. I'm still going to play around with it - and for the price - you can't beat it AT ALL! I did braid the length and play with the bangs a little bit more - I think I will certainly wear it out!
B003DRDHG6|5|ok
B00IZOK5VM|5|I could tell the difference in one use. Great product. I love this stuff and would definitely recommend.
B00152QAXI|5|I was trying to use heat less often lately, and my hair just falls flat! Even when I try to add volume with mousse and straighten my hair up, it still falls flat. So, I thought about hair rollers.     First off, these hair rollers are made to add volume. I have to say, it works wonderfully! I put it in my hair where my bangs are for when I want to air dry, and I even sleep with these on, and it stays on. It may shift of course, depending on how I sleep, but it stays on! There are 3 sizes, large (about 1 1/4 inch) medium (3/4 inch) and small (1/3 inch?). I mainly use the large sizes, but the others are definitely good to have.     For the price and the quantity of it, I have to recommend this product!
B00MMT8DDI|5|It's a very rich oil and the customer service has been amazing. I've been away on a trip but the sellers did their best contacting me multiple times to get my feedback. Much appreciated and this review is long overdue. I use this to treat any scars I have and mix it with my other body care products. I also loved the thank you email with my purchase and the cute dog picture in it.
B004KEON0U|5|I got to try this lotion from my co-worker and my gosh! awesome product. When I use this I don't need to use perfume.  Just the smell of it--my husband said, I smell like a baby! My skin feels better, looks better!
B000V1BDIG|3|I used this religiously during my pregnancy. In the mornings and at bed time every night. I loved the smell and the way it made my skin feel! Unfortunately my belly looks like it has been clawed by a wild animal. I don't think anything truly prevents stretch marks, but who knows maybe it would've been worse without this product. Over all I liked the product, but as far as preventing stretch marks it didn't work for me.
B007MPESWW|1|I thought the product would be more fluid and the lid brush was gnarled up and clumpy.  Good for the trash can only.
B007K6K0IY|2|I received a free sample (full size) of Secret Outlast through Bzzagent to try the product and give my honest opinion of the product.<br /><br />I was so excited to be part of this campaign and try out this gel product! I have always used solid deodorant and was ready to try a different type of product. However, I was very disappointed in what I found.<br /><br />I gave the product a week. I found myself feeling sweaty still each day. Not smelly, just moist/sweaty. This doesn't work for me. I want to feel dry and clean. As soon as I would feel sweaty, I would be self conscious and feel not clean.<br /><br />I have gone back to my solid and left this gel sitting in the bathroom unused.<br /><br />I also had some issues with a lot of air bubbles and inconsistency. The first time I went to apply it, I felt like I had to click the product to where there was only half left inside before I got product to actually come out. I had more issues with air bubbles in the following days.
B001G7PPNI|3|It works pretty good but it has a orange tone. It stays on for a while and it shows up quick. Does not smell bad. Doesn't streak. Good self tanner except for the orange tone.
B0026NR37W|5|This color has so much depth it reminds me of Candy Apple Red...an auto paint color popular in the 60s.  Indoors, the color is glossy ruby...sort of blood-colored actually.  Outside in the sun, the imbedded glitter is dazzling.  It's a great holiday color or toenail color for beach trips.  Like many China Glaze colors, this one is a little thin so needs to be applied carefully and in at least two coats.  It lasts as long or longer than other salon colors.
B005SUN1SK|5|Great Product!  Will buy again..............
B005V6Y0X6|5|Great, I love it. Order was completed very fast.  I ordered again and it is not the same as my first order. It's a lighter color and does not smell as good as my first order.
B005HO0AR2|5|great soap really helps with dry skin<br />Excellent when used with power facial brush
B000FED5DU|5|Great product that works really well! I bought a second one to trim my dog's fur on his paws and rear.
B00028QFAY|1|AFTER CAREFULLY SHOPPING AROUND FOR THE BEST PRICE, I CHOSE TO BUY THIS BECAUSE IT ADVERTISED \\"PACK OF 3\\".  WHAT ELSE WOULD 'PACK OF 3' MEAN???????  I RECEIVED ONE - FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004JSGF4O|5|I am very pleased with this product. The order arrived fast and the product lasts you a long time, you dont need to apply much.
B000053L6W|5|I first had Clubman splashed on my face in a barber shop when I was 4 years old, in 1944!  Great product and great to rediscover it at the age of 65!
B001AXQR4O|5|Great boost of color and shine. This product is not readily available in many stores in my area and I really appreciate being able to order it through Amazon.  I have used this product for 8 years and re-ordered again and again.
B00IOVOCFQ|5|Dove soap was recommended to my family by our dermatologist and we have been using it for many years.  This is a new scent.  Shea Butter is my favorite, but this one is okay, too.
B004AI9234|5|what my bud likes
B00QN3P95Y|5|Love this stuff! My order actually came with a few bonus items- face brush and cloth. I've used it a few times and am obsessed!
B008OTS164|5|Holds really well without all that sticky mess! And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. . . if I sound like a commercial, well, it's worth it!
B00P2TIJIO|3|not as good as &#34;Joan Rivers Have a Great Hair Day&#34;.  Colors are weak.  I will try one more time and order a darker color.
B003LQZTV0|5|I love the smell of this product.  And it is the only thing I've been able to use on my face on a consistent basis without it making me break out.  I like it so much I've purchase some for my sister.
B00K4PLC30|5|I am enjoying how the oil feels on my skin and sinks in. I like the shiny look on my legs after rubbing it in. Good product and will purchase again.
B006W2SYF8|5|Smoother shaving than my previous shaver. Battery last longer. Shaver Feels good on my face. Good price. Case is not included.
B009YSXB3M|4|I got these to cover my hands when I'm driving.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money while I tested out the feasibility of wearing gloves to keep the sun off so I tried these.  They are good, but obviously meant for salon use. (the brand name is in pink and highly visible).  They are light weight so in this Texas heat they don't cause me to overheat.  They serve their purpose for me.
B00H8F1HN4|2|these lashes are way too long and require too much trimming prior to use. I like the style and would be a must-have if it they were shorter. Also they are very hard to glue on.
B00IMHN0B4|5|This smells so good! It's very gentle and not overpowering. It feels nice on my skin. Nice product!
B003YJ70NY|3|I agree with most of the reviews here that this is basically an excellent razor for the money, but I have a problem with it.<br /><br />Perhaps I am the only one who has trouble gripping the razor but I often find the glossy plastic handle difficult to grip making fine control of the razor problematic. Perhaps it's just not a good match for those of us with a light touch. It is my only complaint with this specific razor. I've been using it for about a month now.<br /><br />In any event, I use it mostly on weekends. During the week I just want to get the job done and don't want to spend the extra time and care that double-edge razor shaving can require and so I often revert to more modern multi-blade shaving. I'll give it some more time to see if double-edge shaving is for me.
B009MJENAS|5|Best curling iron I've had in a long time
B00UHNZZ4G|4|I've used cetaphil for many years at a dermatologist's recommendation and always liked the clean feeling. This new formula for men is a welcome addition to the cetaphil line-up. It gave me a deep down clean without drying my skin. Lathered up well. The scent was somewhat medicinal not masculine but faded fast. I will continue to use this product.
B004M8YZD4|5|Hair + Body all-in-one body wash is very a convenient personal hygiene solution for the guy that doesn't like too many bottles in his shower. It's also convenient for washing up after a workout at the gym. I purchased this 6 pack from Amazon because it seemed like all the supermarkets in my area stopped carrying the dandruff control formula. However, I'm glad I purchased it from Amazon as it saved me a lot of money and the product arrived promptly without damage. If you want the convenience of an all-in-one with dandruff control this is the best I have found.
B000PVPEFU|3|I wanted to try this blush because all the fashion magazines usually laud this as THEE blush product to use. Up until now, I've used the mineral blush powder from the drugstore brand, Physicians Formula. The NARS has a slight 'sparkle' to it that my other blushes don't have. It's a nice color and has a smooth finish. However, I don't think it's any better than the drugstore brands and the price sets it apart even more. I personally probably won't purchase it again, but it was worth the try.
B0006LNC2G|2|I have discussed this product with professional make-up artists and they prefer it to other brands.  If you are looking for smudge then this is for you.  It goes on great and then after an hour or two under eye smudge. This happens even when I apply a great eye fix cream.  Mac has a terrific reputation, I don't get it.  I have tried some of their eye products over the years on and off.  Haven't seen anything in the product line that's better
B000143C0K|5|I love them I feel like a professional barber lol
B000R8715M|5|My wife used to take a lot of time straightening her hair now she only takes a few minutes, so it's definitely worth it
B0013ROU46|5|I was so glad to find these! I haven't been able to find them in any store, and was really glad I have 3 now!!!
B006WVCF1I|5|I was introduced to beauty balms by a sample size of a much more expensive brand. A friend was using this one, and I've been happy with Garnier products in the past, so I thought I'd give ti a try.<br /><br />After a week of use, my skin is awesome. Tone is more even, well moisturized, and I've had no trouble with breakouts as some people report. It is fairly thick. While it smooths on and soaks in well, it will result in a lack of oil control later on in the day. It does make the perfect base ever for a mineral base makeup, though.
B00OFRLR9W|1|Has little round to plug so I do not know what to plug it to
B00KGO8XY0|2|The product burned my eyes. I have returned the product for refund.
B00B723M8M|5|I was so pleased to find this discontinued loreal lipstick shade.  Everytime I find a favorite shade of formula of something, they seem to discontine it.  This is my all time favorite shade so I order 8 of them and at a discount rate too.....double score.  My order was processed and arrived at my door within days!!  Very pleased indeed!!!
B001ET78QU|4|it is hard to find organic and i love the smell. I like how it feels after shampoo. the price is cheaper than wholefood.
B000PI36W6|5|First review I have ever left on Amazon after shopping here for 4 years. All I can say; 30 year habit, gone.
B004INQ65S|5|Ok for this price it is amazing, it really does the job tremendously well! I'm very impressed with this iron it's like my old chi
B0010ED3Q8|4|I ordered this bronzer because the price was great for a Stila bronzer.  I should have figured for the price something would be wrong.  The powder cake (bronzer)is not attached to the compact.  The bronzeer itself though is great! Natural looking on my skin.  I have fair skin but also use sunless tanner and it looked good whether I used sunless tanner or it was on my natural color.
B001KUPR4I|4|Love it, it works great.
B00VQTDT3O|5|Love this lipstick!!
B00CBZ090I|1|IT IS NOT WORKING FOR WRINKLES.<br />I DO NOT LIKE THIS ITEM,AND NEVER BUY IT AGAIN.<br />MY RECOMMENDATION IS NOT TO BUY.
B000MVYJ0O|5|Okay just used the huge bar, double 2.5 coast bars and perhaps you are close. Had some pumice in it but, not enough. The lather is creamy, lathers like you Grandpas wet shave with the brush. Do not feel dried out as much ,am sure as time goes on it will put more moisture on my skin. The best moister is water, once dry, apply favorite lotion or cream, then slammo bammo! This especially works well in winter as extra hot h2o, and your heat dries your skin.  Your Military Dermatology Sp.  Will write a head line in 3 to 5 days  Monday afternoon, am loving this mud soap more and more each time shower time. Just use the bar on your skin. Already feel the grainy texture that open your skin with many derm abrasion like grains. Now the Mudd runs in as that happens! Bar is made just fine, seems hard keeping shape. This bar will last a few months easily for men especially and women.
B00005JS5C|5|I used it for a few years now. Works great, very easy to use. Ordered for my daughter. I would recommend this product.
B00ZBN19QA|5|I got these tattoos for a review and they are awesome! Great for a spa day with the ladies. Great for little girl sleep overs. How about theme parties! Love love love them!
B009I0M4C0|3|More like specks of gold than good coverage.
B00563K6VO|1|I recently purchased a curling wand for my hair. I was hoping this would help solve the problem of burning my fingers but this is a piece of junk. It's just a regular glove (something you could purchase for $1). I see nothing special about it or even heat resistant! The worse part is how huge it is. It would fit a large man's hands. The reason I got a &#34;special&#34; glove was because the two finger thing that came with the curler was also too big. It's not like I have huge hands. I have normal sized hands for a female. Lame.
B00AEBYP0G|5|I was a little skeptical at first because it seemed like I was getting a lot for my money.  But I've been happily surprised at how well it all works.  The trays are a little thick but I got used to them fairly quickly.  The whitener is phenomenal.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants/needs to whiten their teeth.
B001U6B188|5|Love it. This was a Mother's Day gift for my Mother-in-law. Nantucket Briar  has been a favorite of mine for years. I knew my Mother-in -law would love it ,too. The product arrived as promised. I would  buy from this dealer again.
B00CJ01QT8|5|I'm in my early 30's, but I've began to use anti-aging products. It's never too early to start! I use this product at night, and in the morning. I feel as though it's already tightened my neck and chin area! My neck is also soft and moisturized, and noticeably healthier looking. It almost has a soft glow to it. Let's face it, only plastic surgery is really going to lift your skin but this cream does help with firmness and improves the overall look of your skin.
B007X6K61M|5|Great product, great company.
B008E703WQ|5|I love the way it leaves my hair feeling. The smell needs work but it leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.
B008LQSOJO|2|The picture looks bigger than the actual picture.
B00EVJGUZ0|1|Web picture deceiving, because I received the salt all white, no pink,  no red.  If you are willing to pay $1 more, you can get food grade dark red and pink Himalayan salt.  Will not buy again.
B00337QTYI|5|I use the bath and body works coconut lime verbena products all the time.  I love the scent and it makes your body and hair feel so soft.  I will purchase this product as long as I am able to find it.<br />Janet
B003UJFLGQ|2|I was so excited when I saw this product, and I found a coupon bringing the price down to only 50 dollars. I used it the night I got it in the mail. It does heat up very quickly and very hot. It was no light to indicate it being on or hot enough or anything. It smells when it heats up, and I'm afraid I really singed my hair. I curl my hair often, I have noraml hair, straight and normal, not thin or super thick. I only held it on the curler for 8-10 seconds (because holding it for less wasn't curling my hair) It does not have heat settings, it is so hot, my poor hair smells burnt! Not good. I have done this same type of curl with my regular clamp curling iron (just leaving it closed and wrapping around) and it worked very well, and did not singe my hair. I was expecting something amazing from this iron, all I got was a smelly room (from the iron heating) and smelly hair that is curled, but there has got to be something better. The company is sketchy, I'm usually good with seeing that and doing my research, but I thought this was the only place that had a wand (didn't do too much research =( ) and the high price made me think it must be good. I definitely am going to try to send it back...I have a feeling that the NuMe company is sketchy about it because they know their irons are not very good. I'm so used to being able to return everything I didn't look into it before I placed the order, and I guess I thought how could I not love it. I was duped. So please, order a different wand from a different company!!
B00MZMCD4W|4|Don't get me wrong still a terrific product; the price is fair as well, smell is very close if not similar to the actual thing; the reason it's not a 5 it's because it doesn't last like the other products that I have purchased from this seller.but I still recommend you to try it.
B003RR4A2M|5|This is a fantastic straightener. I have been using the Croc for years and have always been satisfied with it, love the digital temperature control!
B0085E6OC6|5|Great product and packing super!
B002EFPAFE|5|I've been using a variety of products for dry cracked hands and fingers.<br />Some work well on roughness of knuckles, but fail to heal the tips of cracked and bleeding fingers.<br /><br />Finally - I did a quick research of what ingredients in products work best for split/cracked finger tips.<br />I found a common denominator to be natural Shea butter,<br />which is an off-white or ivory-colored fat extracted from the nut of the African Shea tree.<br /><br />I like the smell of Nutmeg, so I settled on this Badger product of Nutmeg & Shea.<br />It's a bit greasy but mostly rubs in, and in a few minutes, maybe five, all is soaked in.<br />The Nutmeg smells nice, isn't very strong, it certainty isn't offensive.<br /><br />Within the first day of use the soreness was gone around my thumb, and the next day, closed up and healing.<br />I'm impressed!<br /><br />There's a lot in this two ounce tin, the cake of product in the can is 2 1/2\\" circumference 5/8\\" thick.<br />A little goes a long way. The lid lifts off very easily.<br /><br />I've found this is also wonderful for knuckles, elbows, feet - etc.<br /><br />Footnote. Also purchased 'Badger cuticle cream' to see which one is better.<br />This 'Badger Nutmeg & Shea' says it contains Vitellaria paradoxa<br />The 'Badger cuticle cream' says it contains Butyrospermum parkii<br />Wikipedia says there the same thing, Vitellaria paradoxa, previously called Butyrospermum parkii.
B008S3U39E|5|It's really nice, works well, and came quickly also very reasonably priced! I would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend!
B00KLLKYGI|4|Good quality & speedy dekivery
B00HXTD60W|4|The soap does whiten but when I stopped using it. The soap does work well, but It caused irritation and darkening of my skin when I discontinued use. You can't stop using it to continue to get the benefits of the soap. That is why I gave it four stars and not five.
B0049MCVIY|5|Thanks!
B0032P3TIA|5|i really really like this product. its gives so many bronze and tan colors to make you look the perfect color, and i would totally buy this again
B000FEWBZS|5|Miracle Foot Repair Cream is an excellent product, one I have been very satisfied using and will buy again. It feels creamier than other foot creams I've tried. Unlike other creams that often leave a greasy after effect, the Miracle Foot Repair Cream penetrates quickly leaving a silky feeling. You won't find it an absolutely necessity to wear socks to prevent slipping should you need to take a step. Used in combination with the [[ASIN:B000FZ4TFC Artemis Heel Smoother Pedicure Appliance]] the improvement in the condition of my feet is significant. Try it, you won't be disappointed with the results. ~ Mrs. B
B004Y9M98E|5|Great service love the lipstick. Wish it was not discontinued.
B00JKQ0442|5|Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift, he wonders how he went through live not using this razor set. He uses it every day and goes &#34;see how baby soft my skin feels&#34; he says it gives him a very close shave without being too aggressive. I remember my father using a razor set just like this, it's old school but I see younger men coming back to using the &#34;old tools&#34; because they get the jog done.
B001VD2FV2|5|Just what I wanted.
B00NPGPXS0|4|Like it, but wearing out to soon.
B00BAY27TM|5|I love the color, ideal for summer. Delivery was fast and it was packaged very nicely.
B0001G7CB8|2|I used this soap for many years when I lived in Europe.  This soap is packaged the same way in the folded black paper and the scent is similar to the original Maja.  But, this is not the original; the scent is not as pleasant nor as strong.  I'm disappointed.
B00GCGBLTA|1|Purchased this product to assist with healing micro dermal piercings. I put one drop of this product on my dermal and woke up with a inflamed, infected,  SWOLLEN dermals that were no longer visible.  I purchased this product as it claims to assist with healing piercings, the only thing it did was prolong the process by infecting my piercings!  I am as angry as my dermals looks right now.  Hopefully Amazon will take this crap back.  Do not purchase this product, I doubt that I just got a bad bottle.  I've learned my lesson, only use 100% STERILE products on your piercings
B002UUT43C|4|I bought this lotion and it is excellent.  Has a great smell and doesn't leave an oily finish when putting it on.  However, I did not really look at the size of this lotion as it is a smaller bottle (8.4 oz) and not the normal 13.5 oz size that I get from the store.  This is a great product, just take the size of the bottle into consideration.
B003LYJQSO|3|The same thing for the shampoo, I like it, but I couldn't see the difference on a regular shampoo. It is expensive.
B001UE60E0|5|This is a great product! It cleans well and is not oily. I have oily skin and this does not increase the natural oil from my skin.
B00EYBZNY4|5|Got this for my GF to use with her Hitachi and while she hasn't done that yet so no comment there we have used it together without the Hitachi and we both love the position that it puts her in.  Liberator makes some really good products and this is one of them.
B004LE0YW0|5|I've been using the Olay Pro-X brush since it hit the market and I must say I love it. I actually have 2, 1 for home and 1 for travel. It's small and does the job. While some have concerns about the brush softness, it's just perfect for me. I had a product similar to this one years ago but the brush was too stiff and the company didn't sell replacement brushes. Too stiff a brush can cause microscopic abrasions on your skin. That's just asking for problems.<br /><br />I not only use the Olay face cleansing cream but have also used other creams with wonderful results. I use a Bobbie Brown product to remove most of my makeup first and this little tool does a great job of removing the rest. I use this product daily.<br /><br />I don't expect miracles in regards to skin tightening from any product. I'll leave that to a plastic surgeon. But I do love the clean, fresh feeling on my face after using this product. I liked this product so much I bought it for my 3 sisters and 2 nieces. All of them are thrilled and love using it.<br /><br />What's also nice is that you can buy extra brushes, here at Amazon or at your local Walgreens. I would definitely recommend this product to friends. If you're looking for a quality product that lasts, does the job, is easy to take with you and will not scratch your skin then this is the one to get. Why purchase a $200 product when this one does the job as effectively? Definitely a great purchase.
B002PRSFJO|5|amazing
B001EJOPQG|5|I bought this for my parents, they can't seem to find this anymore, but I was able to find it here.  They say this has the best hold and really keeps food out.
B001LYYLJA|5|This product gets me clean with no film or residue and has no strong deoderant smell. Needed it Love it.
B00006498N|5|Old school I know but this is the only dryer that's ever been usable for my baby fine long tangly mess of hair. They ever stop making these and I'll have to switch to wigs.
B009LOJ5MA|1|I've been using this for a week and got allergic. This product has a weird smell and I doubt abt the chemical stuff inside.
B0000ZLF54|5|This is a lovely soft scent.  Slightly musky with flower tones as well.  It's now my favorite new scent.  I just ordered more to have one for my purse as well!
B007SVXI44|5|Excelent
B00JXRBVYU|5|It makes my skin feel so soft and not at all oily like you would think. Love it!
B004OG90X4|5|This is by far one of the best cleansers I have tried. This is actually my 3rd time purchasing the product! It takes off everything - even mineral makeup and long-wear foundation! It is also very gentle on the skin!
B003NPUK22|5|it was exactly what I wanted
B006V6T1X4|5|Woah, glutathione in combination with kojic acid is amazing !! This with fair and white and pineapple aha arbutin will leave you a shade lighter in a month but results seen in 2 weeks. Proper exfoliation and sunscreen are needed to see results
B0026786WY|5|Works great for gas due to medication.
B004R6HIR6|1|It's okay but it's VERY thick and VERYYYYY GREY. Turns a normal color after about twenty mins. But until the. You look like you're dying.
B003987CL0|3|Purchased this razor first, then purchased the Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor.  Prefer the later.  Why? Not as bulky and fat, not that many blades, easier to shave under the nose and around the lips.  They both provide close shaves, hence I would go for the ease of access to shaving parts on your face.  If you find the Proglide Power Razor too fat and difficult to shave with, then try the Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor.  I prefer shaving with the razor in the vibrate-power mode.
B002LCBBMQ|5|OK OK so yes I like football and I scratch places that makes my wife cringe...and YES I bought this &#34;body wash&#34;...boy that is hard to admit...for myself.  I like it.  Its guy soap and smells like clean wood, Wife even likes it.  So buy it.  Its expensive but at least you don't smell like a panzie!
B00HDZ733M|5|My 8 year old daughter has long curly hair like mine, which tends to get frizzy and tangles very easily. Every day is a struggle when it comes to brushing her hair to get ready for school, sometimes accompanied by tears. Because of this, she has preferred to keep her hair in a ponytail every day for the last several years since it tangles even worse when worn loose. I did my research and read reviews and decided on this detangling brush by crave naturals. I got it today and tried it first on myself and then on her when she got home from school, which happened to be a snowy day and her hair was extra messy from several recesses and hat wearing. This thing is amazing! It slid through her hair like butter, detangling without pulling and there was not a single whimper of discomfort. She was so happy that she even brushed her own hair with it several more times this afternoon/evening and can't wait to use it in the morning. I so wish I had found this brush sooner. I'll probably be buying another to use myself, and possibly a third to have as backup.
B001A25EKS|3|I am a huge fan of the Ojon line, so when I bought this products I had high hopes! A product that could actually re-build and put that strength back into my hair? I am all for it!!!!! I ended up sending this kit back to QVC because while I thought it was a great deep conditioner, I didnt feel like it lived up to it $100 price tag. You are better off just saving your money and getting the regular Ojon deep treatment.
B00IEXLE7I|3|I got it sooner than expected however,  it looks pretty cheap so I'm kind of not so eager to give it away now. But its cute so hopefully the thought does count.
B0057MHTAA|5|I'm a young and powerful heterosexual male and let me tell you, this product is fabulous. Me and my eastern European skin are gleaming with excellence. If you want to be as dazzling as I... then go ahead and buy this superior face wash. You won't regret it, boys.
B005X5GR8Q|2|If you are buying this brush to blow out your hair with some curl DONT BUY THIS BRUSH. It isn't hollow so the air can't flow through the brush, which is a pretty substantial design flaw. also all the tiny bristles are stupid and just make it so it doesn't roll through the hair easily enough when blowing the hair out.<br /><br />This is my punishment for being too lazy to go to the beauty supply store for a fatter round brush.<br /><br />In short this brush basically sucks.
B003YCAQDC|5|This is my favorite mascara and I've tried EVERYTHING!!!  It really lengthens and doesn't clump.  My only complaint is that it's difficult to remove.
B0041V5XT2|3|This product was okay...although it didnt really help withh my acne problem..i would recommed it to someone with less acne prone skin
B001FWXT8W|5|I buy these for my toddler who brushes his teeth once a day for 2 minutes. Each brush lasts about a month. He also gets the same brush from our pediatric dentist. I'm very happy with the Subscribe & Save value. I haven't had any issues with bristles falling out except when I catch my son chewing on the brush.<br /><br />My son has sensory processing issues, and I've tried lots of brushes, including battery powered brushes, but the noise and the vibration of those bother him. We'll be sticking with these brushes for a long time.
B003IQLLRO|5|over-sized, easy to clean, very very well made, zipper is well-constructed.<br />I like this bag for my huge purse.<br />This can also be used when packing for a travel.
B00GXORHF8|3|It's ok, but it smells like a mix between an old lady's perfume and a man's cologne.  My daughter had it on for a few hours before we ended up washing it off.  It got to where we could barely stand to smell it.  Everyone has his or her own opinions on smells, tastes, etc.  Personally, I couldn't get used to the smell.<br /><br />On the other hand, if I could have gotten used to the smell, it would have worked wonderfully.  It rolled easily and covered very well.
B0009ZGK5K|4|Have used it on couple of days growth.  I do get nearly clean shave, but get skin irritation also.  Couple of missed or pulled hair.  What I like is the quick charge and be able to use it corded as I am not regular shaver.  Decent value for money ($30) paid.
B002U2Q3BG|1|Since, June 28, 2013 I refused the package, because by the size, I can tell that was a WRONG product.<br />I want to have my money returned to the credit card.
B003Z4OD24|5|Does a great job of exfoliating and removing oils and last quite a long time as you don't need to use much each time.  This is the best face scrub I've used and it doesn't have plastic microbeads which is now considered to be a major source of environmental pollution.
B000H83GT2|5|I buy this for my husband along with the shave cream...he loves it and it is the only scrub that he will use!  It is mild and easy on his skin!
B008UAIM52|1|I am very unhappy with this, since is cheap I guess, is the way should be? I purchased 2 wheels and both are almost empty, they are misleading with the picture that is posted, that is  nothing close to what they have sent. See the picture that I am presenting for this review.
B000SSDTOI|4|I just cut my nails, forgot my nail file, but the file at the bottom of the case actually worked pretty well. I say this cause the Seki Edge Nail Clipper will cut your nails easily, but leaves it quite sharp or rough. Basically they need to be filed. I see no problem with this, but in case you need to cut, but don't have a nail file with you the one on the bottom of the holder will suffice.<br /><br />NOW, about the clipper itself, its a good size, and is easy to use. It will cut a huge thick toe nail with ease and I like the thumb indent on the tip of the lever, makes it more ergonomic and easy to squeeze. Sometimes I feel like its a bit flimsy where the top lever is attached, but I think its because I don't feel any tension or tightness when I fold it into clipping mode.<br /><br />Great buy, easy to use and will cut a thick nail quick...no need to clip twice to cut through that huge toe nail.
B000ULLKLW|5|I frequently moisturize my lips and Qtica Intense Lip Repair Balm lasts longer than other products I have used.  It is my favorite lip balm.
B0001HYKBW|1|I have had this trimmer for some time now.  The most disturbing thing about it was that you never know when the charge will die and then you are stuck because you CAN NOT use it while it is plugged in and charging.  Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the T980 with the turbo shave.  Charges fast and you can use it while it is plugged in. Plus with the 770 holding a charge has always been a problem.  Get the T980.
B00LT4HLCQ|5|Great quality! Smells really nice and the presentation is adorable.
B001OPH7PG|4|good stuff
B00HJDIAGC|5|Sensitive teeth owner here, and I didn't have any issues with it. I hope you give it a shot if you are like me, because I hope you get the same results. No issues whatsoever.
B003SGMI6W|1|Left my hair feeling like straw, unmanageable. I wasn't able to pull a comb straight through after washing my hair with this shampoo. Very disappointed
B002LFLRG8|5|It is a very creamy liner, a breeze to put on! It stays put for at least 5hours. My makeup remover (bioderma) takes it off in one swipe. Overall I am very happy with this product.
B005H151V0|5|Love this product
B006WVCF1I|5|Ohmygosh it WORKS. I am a 29yo female who has always had problem skin. Nothing major, but it seems like since i was a teenager, as soon as one breakout cleared up, I'd break out elsewhere on my face. I've finally gotten serious about my skincare routine and voila: CLEAR SKIN. I'm finally comfortable enough not to pile on the makeup. But my skin tone is still uneven (redness in my tzone and some scars) so I wanted to try something to even it out. Tinted moisturizers weren't enough, and foundations as too heavy. I ran across this product and decided to give it a shot and I'm shocked it works just like it says it should! I only use a little right over my problem areas and it blends right in and stays put my whole work day.    I have combo skin which gets dry and flaky when I use my dermatologists prescription and oily as the day goes on. Unlike other reviews, I didn't think this went on oily, in fact I thought it went on and felt dry almost too quickly. But overall I am very happy with it. As long as my skin doesn't react negatively to this new product, I plan on using it long term.
B001HZ4QIE|4|Very nice for the price I got
B007W3DMQC|1|I got a bottle of this hair dye to dye my hair blue. It was extremely thick and the instructions did not tell you what to do. I was planning on doing my whole head, I only had enough for the tips. It was extremely hard to get into my hair, and made it look like a mess. Washing it, most of it came out and blonde streeks were all through it. Also, it turned out green instead of the blue I wanted, and I have blonde hair. AWFUL!! I'm extremely unhappy and plan on going back to manic panic.
B0056IJRV4|5|This lotion is lightweight and absorbs into skin fast without a sticky heavy residue. This is the only lotion that I use.
B0073RQMXC|5|I am female and I use these razors because I think they are the best out there. I've read many places that they make male razors better than female since they are used on the face rather than the legs, and I tend to agree. I have very sensitive skin, so the hydration strip in these razors really help with the razor burn. Overall, very pleased and have been using this razor for quite a while.
B00BOTTCM8|5|Baby safe & adorable!
B00517W47O|5|Better than I expected
B00NXDR248|5|the best shampoo ever!!  finally!!
B00022WA9K|3|I have purchased at least 6 of the Revlon RV440C or equivalent Revlon products over the past 3 years and only one is working now. When I placed the order in April, I ordered two, and one has a short and will not run on fast fan, hot heat. Now I need to order another \\"spare\\" as I never know when it is going to fail. But as you can see, I can't live without this hot air dryer as it makes hair styling much easier. If only the Revlon company could improve the reliability.
B000Z63Y5C|5|It's the best eyebrow pencil I've ever used. Blendable, easy to apply.<br />I've been using it for years  - tried other brands and have always come back to Kevyn Aucoin.
B00912CL5K|5|Tiny but durable.
B00CMJD43C|3|I have had this product a few times, but the last time I bought it, its smelled incredibly rotten, and i think this depends on the amount or strength of neem in the product, which seems to change bottle to bottle.  I love it when i can stand the smell, my face is really at its best and I usually have breakouts every month, so its quite the challenge to find something that helps.  When the balance is off and the neem is too strong, watch out, you will feel like you stuck your head in a garbage truck for an hour or so, its really too bad neem smells that way!
B00GJYMRUC|5|I combine this product with their vitamin C serum.  WOW!  My skin has a smoother texture AND dark spots have lightened.  I've never been so pleasantly surprised.  My dark pigmented spots have significantly diminished. I purchased enough for my sisters, my daughters and we all love these products!  I recommend the combination of a few drops of the vitamin C with a few drops of the hyaluronic acid serum twice a day. After a couple minutes follow with your regular day or nighttime cream.<br /><br />I also want to mention that I feel the price of the serum is a bargain.  I spent $600.00 for a competitor's serum and didn't get near the results.<br /><br />I have been using this for over a month.  I love  love love this brand!
B006QO4C1W|5|I wish this had more than just a 2 minute timer, but it works great. Took a few minutes to put the bulbs in, some were a bit difficult. Once I got them it it worked perfectly! Great for gel polish/shellac. Have only had it for about a week now, but no problems thus far.
B003JHSA62|4|It is easy to keep clean, and it comes with extra bulbs, toothbrush holders and toothbrushes. If you can get past the sticker shock, it is worth the price in the long run.
B0080CO2F4|2|This clip is beautiful, and it's difficult to beat the price.  However, I was very disappointed when it broke after maybe half a dozen uses.  I gave it two stars instead of one simply for the price.  Still, I wouldn't buy this again.
B002WTCK32|4|It is easier to get rid of food deris with sonication but it is difficult to clean tooth stone. It is not a wise choice if you had Waterpik.I still give four stars because it is inexpensive as compared to Waterpik and a bonnus dental mirror is included.
B0006M5566|5|I have used eb5 cream for over 30 years now. People tell me I don't look my age at all.  I am 68 now and the great grand mother of 13.
B005IAZUEI|4|I have naturally curly hair. This product works very well to straighten my hair. Probably the only thing I don't love about it is the texture if my hair with using this feels a little dry.
B000R80ZTQ|4|First, let me start by saying, I use my blow dryer lightly compared to others, so I can't comment on the longevity of this dryer. I am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there, but this particular one does a great job.<br /><br />I really like how quiet this is compared to some other models I've owned. Even on high, the noise is dramatically muted (if you shower during your childs naptime as I do, then this is HUGE!). While I initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus, it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome. I keep my dryer in a drawer in my bathroom. My old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times, but overall, it was pretty compact. Not so with this model. The end of the plug cord is thicker, and difficult to bend, and the nose of the dryer is a bit longer then I'm used to. Not the end of the world though.<br /><br />I tried the diffuser one day, but found it to be a huge pain to work with, so I just set it aside...I've gone this long without ever using one, I'm sure I'll be fine without it. I always keep the concentrator on though (which only adds to the size of the dryer come storage time). It's great for quick, high temp drying, or for bangs. Overall, I'd recommend this. It's a good dryer that gets the job done, even though storing it can be kinda awkward..
B00TI6TSGY|5|Does a good job!!!!
B00LMIVLXY|5|I have natural non-permed hair and have used many other thermal sprays. This really does make your hair smooth and shiny and it smells good.
B0055FF2SU|3|I was hoping this would help a little bit with the all over oil problems I have, but it did nothing for oil control.  It does work great as a plain moisturizer.  It feels like it creates a barrier on the skin when you put it on, making it great for holding the moisture during the harsh Midwest winters.  Nothing special about this product and I probably won't repurchase.
B007PSBBAS|5|I love this product!
B007R3SGVI|5|After using the product for some time, I had not been able to find it in local stores and was so disappointed.  So glad to find it on the site.  I have short straight hair and it gives me the volume and hold needed.
B0041TBSS4|5|I absolutely love this shampoo & conditioner, just wish the scent was stronger. It's pretty strong, but my sense of smell is weak, so the stronger the better!
B00V1WSRSS|4|Strongly built - works well.
B00NY5NGPE|4|This serum works, but please be careful with use, I over exfoliated my skin .
B008J2NM3S|5|Wife Loves it
B008YS8F7A|5|SMELL EXACTLY LIKE THE BODY LOTION.......IT IS ORIGINAL, BEST SMELL EVER.....DONT LAST LONG. PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION
B0053TRHYU|3|Could be a little more absorbent.
B0057J4Y56|5|Very faint but effective for old silver haired ladies with fair skin. I wish it had a brush with it.
B008G399W8|5|#Best Scent Ever :)
B0019UXR00|5|I have very sensitive and very dry skin.  Up until I discovered Pevonia I had a very difficult time moisturizing my skin.  I have continued to find something cheaper that would do the trick but have been unsuccessful.  Pevonia is very creamy and not thick like other products that are actually more drying because of their thickness.  I love this product and have been using it for years!
B00461F4PA|5|At first I thought it was a scam or something. I didn't think it would work but because I trusted the reviews of other customers I decided to give it a try. I'm so happy to say that it worked. My feet were damaged from me walking on them while pregnant. I don't know how but my heels had raised scales on them. It would scratch my husbands legs at night and he made me wear socks to bed. Well baby foot worked and those nasty looking thick chunks of skin that were on my heels and big toes are gone. It ever took off my callus.I peeled it off with the rest of the skin. I'm still peeling because it's been 7 days and I haven't had the time to get it all off but it is so wonderful and I'm very happy it worked on my thick skin I will be buying again.
B00O1ZQO00|4|Very sweet little card. Exactly as portrayed on the website.
B00757ASIA|5|Use it everyday
B007D84PVM|4|this is a good product, as most of skinceuticals is... i did not realize it is for spot treatment.  it says it will lighten skin, i was wanting this more evening tone on my whole face, not for spot treatment.
B0084PXVX6|5|I LOVE this Shea Butter and it is so much less expensive than my previous 1 lb purchase ($15.99!!).  Information came with this butter directing me to a Youtube video with instructions as to how to process the butter.  I followed those instructions the day I received the package and now store the butter in the refrigerator. It is ready to use anytime I make a cream or lotion.  It should last 2 years, so as long as it does, I am VERY happy.  I ended up with 5 lbs of butter for a little more than I paid for 1 lb.  If you're using Shea butter on a regular basis, it is definitely worth purchasing this product.
