B00003CX5P|1.0|Who cares about this horrible movie?  Would Han Solo ever have made fart jokes like Jar Jar? For that matter, if I never see Jar Jar again it will be too soon.  What a disappointment. Please release IV, V and VI on DVD asap! (and preferably the original versions of those, too)
0767819462|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  The chemistry between the two women is so interesting in how they relate to each other and to the children.  I recommend it to everyone, especially stepmoms.
0767821629|3.0|Despite the fair ratings that the people think of this movie, I would have to say that it actually wasn't all that bad.  I think that the concept of a virtual reality within a virtual reality is great and sometimes more frightening than the world of the Matrix.  Personally, I think that the acting held up better in this movie than Keanu Reeves' neo.  Everytime I see Keanu I expect &quot;dude&quot; to come  out of his mouth.  In this movie, there is actually a more intelligent dialogue that allows the audience to actually think (Imagine that!).  Gretchen Mol was perfectly cast in this movie and I think that the darkness of the film really enhances her beauty.  All in all, I enjoyed it.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This film is a textbook example of what Robert Redford once said: &quot;They don't make movies in Hollywood anymore.  They market them.&quot; This bland, childish film overwhelms with special effects to hide the lack of an intelligent script.  Toy-tie ins and over-kill marketing showed that Lucas didn't care about entertaining people as much as he wanted to make money!  But we can probably look forward to more with 'Clone' toy tie-ins in Episode 2.  Oh, yeah...did anybody say anything about a script for this one?
6305127638|2.0|. . .from the established &quot;Star Trek&quot; Canon.<br />First, the good bits:  This was an exciting adventure movie involving the Borg -- certainly one of the better adversaries ever created in a science-fiction setting.<br />THIS BEING SAID:<br />The DEPLORABLE portrayal of Zephram Cochrane, inventor of the warp drive and the equally DEPLORABLE &quot;first contact&quot; encounter with the Vulcans flies in the face of everything that REAL Trekkies know and have known about the &quot;future history&quot; of the Star Trek world.<br />Rick Berman and crowd have apparently successfully completely taken over the world envisioned by the late Gene Roddenberry, and the thousands of TRUE Star Trek fans from the 60's, 70's and early 80's.  I, for one, don't like it.<br />For Canonical Star Trek information about the invention of the warp drive, first contact with the Vulcans, etc. please allow me to refer the reader to the sadly out-of-print &quot;Star Trek Space Flight Chronology&quot; and to the early classic Trek novels.<br />For an adventure movie, yeah, this was worth the minimal time investment.  For a true &quot;Trek&quot; fan, however, this was a sad disappointment.
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a Down's s/t debut was an album that totally blew me away. It is among my top 10 fav. albums of all time. That was the year 1998, and it has been 3 years since SOAD has blessed us with their musical goodness, and now 3 years later SOAD has dropped Toxicity. Toxicity has picked up right where s/t left off. The same unexpected time changes and death-metal-like intensity is what SOAD is all about. Serj is sounding better than ever with his distinct hardcore growls, and Daron Malakian returns as one of the industry's most talented guitarists. Toxicity is the album of the year....plain and simple...nothing will top this album. <br />Tracks of note--- Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Chop Suey! ATWA, Science, Toxicity, Psycho and Ariels
B000003TBP|5.0|Verdaderamente, empiezo a entender, la locura de BECK HANSEN.<br /> Para comenzar mis palabras necias, quiero afirmar que, este disco no solo tiene influencias OBVIAS, de grupos e interpretes, que ya conocemos!, si no, una influencia PLASTICA, tomada del surrealismo o llevada de la mano, por los sentimientos intrauterinos, o porque no, de la infancia de beck.<BR> No digo esto, como si tuviese información de primera mano para afirmarlo, simplemente es una intuición que he percibido desde el momento que tuve el disco en mis manos.<BR> Cuando hago referencia a esta intuición, me siento que he apreciado este material de otra forma, ya que las canciones y las ilustraciones estan llenas de una intención verdaderamente extraña, y un acabado muy inusual para la epoca, y se, que no es nada nuevo lo que aquì digo, pero creo que beck, mantiene una intención que no es intención!.. y asì es la música del ODELAY,(influencias y ego), ademas de las personas que tratan de clasificarlo.<br /> Una de las cosas que mas me alegra del ODELAY, es el estilo (una palabra que no me gusta utilizar)que beck ha logrado implantar en su propio ambiente preestablecido, y considerando todas sus influencias, ha salido triunfante de este ingenioso trabajo.<BR> El disco abre con DEVIL'S HAIRCUT, una verdadera impresión para pocos, y su video no es para niños comedores de MTV; le sige HOTWAX:una cosa que no puedo explicar;luego LORD ONLY KNOWS: una raresa en este disco, pero necesario para beck, que mantiene una estrecha relación con el COUNTRY; THE NEW POLUTION: que contribuye con un son bastante bailable y burlesco, que beck usarìa posteriormente en MIDNITE VULTURES con HOLLYWOOD FREAKS o GET REAL PAID. DERELICT: bastante experimental en su naturalidad de composición y de sencilla melodìa; JACKASS: muy cercana al MUTATIONS, que yo dirìa que es el lado melancólico; WHERE IT'S AT: una locura mejorada de un DJ absurdo, con un gusto, y un tacto fenomenal; MINUS: una canción que me atreverìa a especular, que se la escribió a CALVIN JOHNSON; HIGH FIVE(rock the castskills):es una de mis favoritas, raperos gritando, y mezclas ordinarias revolviendo la atmosfera; READYMADE: creo que no puedo decir nada sobre esta canción! es totalmente minimal, amo esta locura; SISSY-NECK y las que restan son el cierre de un disco, con mucha información, a nivel artistico, de influencia y conflicto de busqueda permanente, este disco no es ninguna tonterìa, solo que no es tan facil de consumir, o te gusta demasiado o no te gusta.<BR> El surrealismo que percibo, es, como toda esta mezcla de ritmos, ilustraciones, canciones y fragmentos escondidos, logran concentrarse bien, en un cìrculo tan cerrado pero tan consistente que hacen de este trabajo, un vistazo nuy personal y demasiado subjetivo. A causa de su intuición musical, ODELAY, logra ser un disco fantasma, para muchos, y digo fantasma por que practicamente se puso al nivel de la MODA en su crucial nacimiento, tan parecido al surrealismo de 1926, cuando ANDRE BRETON dijo: &quot;somos un pan dormido&quot;, todo este trabajo se quedó dormido, aun asì, para mi es uno de los discos  personales jamas realizados.
B00005NP04|5.0|I have been a fan of Martina's since I discovered her music when she was opening shows for my all time favorite, Garth Brooks.  Over the years I have grown to love her music.  She is not afraid to tackle difficult subjects with her music and I greatly admire her for that.  I have all her albums, so that means I have most of the music on this CD, but the new songs on this album, especially &quot;When God-Fearing Women get the Blues&quot; is worth the price of the whole album.  This one is a keeper.  Keep it up, Martina.
B00004Z459|5.0|For a good while, I was tired of a lot of the music available.  Then I heard Linkin Park and bought the CD.  I honestly can't get enough of this CD!  Every song is awesome!  This band has some of the best talent i've ever heard.  The lyrics are great and the music is just so well crafted.  I promise, if you like rock you won't be disappointed with Linkin Park.  I can't wait to see what they produce next.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I have been waiting for this one for a long time. Although his last album (1997's time out of mind) was a great recording, it was, in my opinion, over produced by Daniel Lanois (too atmospheric, which all of his productions are). However, Dylan's usual quality of songwriting and muscianship prevailed in spite of my pickyness about the production. 'Love and Theft' is pure Dylan. It is what his two earlier traditional albums should have sounded like. Dylan betters the traditional albums by instead of doing other's traditional folk/blues/etc songs, he has written his own. And he haas created songs that should be called traditional in the future.<BR>The music on the album meets the quality of the words easily. I saw Dylan and band perform last fall in Salsibury,Md. and his band was outstanding! What a show! By taking his touring band into the studio while in the middle of touring, Dylan has tapped into a vein of artistic energy that the band reaches admirably. The songs are all over the place stylistically (mid tempo rock, folk, bluegrass, traditional, country western, bohemian, transient, old west, americana, etc... However you try to label it, the different songs are all pulled together to create a musical masterpiece by the older, craggier Dylan voice that you either love or hate. I love it just like I love this album. <BR>P.s. I have seen Dylan live  five times now, and four of the shows rank in the top ten of all of the concerts that I have seen. I wish Sony would release a bootleg series of live Dylan from the 1980's,90's,and 2000's.....Give us what we want!!!!
6305011575|2.0|I thought this film was downright irritating! Not only just because the acting was wooden and the interpretation was anything but dynamic and scary, but also because it does absolutely no justice to the book. I read the book first and was transfixed by it, but the film wanders whimsically from moment to moment with little regard for plot or character development, and completely ignored the magnitude of what IT is, and where it comes from. Trust me, in the book it was more then just a giant plastic spider! Sorry for spoiling the ending, but really, if you watched the film, you wouldn't mind. Conlusion: possibly the best book I've ever read, but an appaling film.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen this year.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidmen are spectacular, spectacular.  If you love musicals and love beautiful people this is for you!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Sides will perhaps be taken as to whether or not THE LOOK OF LOVE is a step forward for Diana Krall, since it does veer in style from the expected. Not to marginalize her previous albums, but I consider this CD to be a major leap forward for an already impressive talent.  Note the following: 1) Diana is accompianed by an orchestra here, rather than a small jazz combo (although of course Diana still contributes piano solos). 2) Those who liked some of the finger-snapping up-tempo tunes she has recorded in the past should prepare themselves--that isn't the mood she is visiting this time around. 3) The music generally falls within the spirit or the letter of bossa nova, and the expected degree of subtlety in this genre is maintained from the album's beginning to finish. <br />The tone of the album isn't somber, but it does deal with adult emotions, specifically the ups and downs of love...and as anyone who is familiar with such bittersweet gems as I GET ALONG... can attest, the latter can be particularly poignant when the singer channels such tunes' multi-layers of heartfelt emotion effectively, as Diana does here.  Throughout, Diana's voice is a flawless gem, not so much technically--although I have no complaints regarding that--as in her power to communicate from the soul to a degree that I find approaches that of the best 1950s-vintage Frank Sinatra concept albums. As did Sinatra, Diana often sings barely above a whisper, but at appropriate times raises her singing voice for dramatic effect. Hopefully such a departure from previous CDs is an indication that Diana isn't going to pander to the change-resistant faction of her fandom, but rather that she will risk her popularity by exploring whatever music that she is inspired to tackle at a given point in her career.  Who says a traditionalist can't think like a progressive?
0156711427|5.0|A Passage to India is the quintessential British novel of the twentieth century.  It is E.M. Forster at his finest.  Forster uses his experiences as a foreigner abroad to vividly display the strained relations between colonial Brits and their Indian subjects.  The importance of this cross cultural novel is as relevant today as it was when first published in the 1920's.   The descriptions of India are striking and beautiful, told with a simplicity reminiscent of Hemingway and an honesty I thought peculiar only to Capote.  Easily Forster's most memorable and engaging novel wherein the author shows that with age comes a kind of excellence.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine at her best. A very enjoyable cd. I love all of Celine Dion's cd's and this one is no exception. I recommend this to all Celine fans, you wont be dissapointed.
B000001GXB|5.0|I always have a tendency to follow the printed score of the music I'm listening to(assuming that I have it). When it comes to Beethoven's late piano sonatas and specially this recording, I'm always forced to appreciate the astonishing performance that Mr Pollini has made, once again, in this recording. By far, I haven't found a single note or a single dynamic symbol that Mr Pollini has ignored. It's really the sound that must be heard from all these emotionally complicated masterpieces. I personally don't like it when some interpreters overemphasize some phrases and only take a glance at the others. Mr Pollini never falls into this trap in this recording and I strongly recommend this to anyone that wants to hear the real sound of Beethoven's late legacy.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|When Leonard wakes up during the night to find his wife not next to him in bed, he automatically yells to her demanding that it's late.  When he gets no response except what sounds like muffled screaming from the bathroom, he immediately gets out of bed and picks up his gun to investigate the situation.  As he opens the bathroom door, he finds what seem to be a man atackaing his wife.  Leonard shoots one man directly in the head, seeming to kill him.  When he goes to check if his wife is okay, he is pushed from behind by another man, slamming his head and falling to the ground beside his wife.  As he lays their next to his wife, staring into her eyes, the second attacker runs away and the scene fades to darkness.  This is Leonard Shelby's final memory.  The only thing Leonard has as he begins his search for the man who raped and killed his wife and destroyed his ability to create new memories is a name: John G.<br />This is the basis of Memento, one of the most interesting and imaginative movies ever created.  Without the ability to hold a thought for more than a few minutes, Leonard has developed a system of ways to keep track of his investigation through a complex series of notes, photos, and tatoos.  The movie is played backwards in a way that a scene is shown for about ten minutes and then another scene is shown of how that scene came to be, and this goes on and on throughout the whole movie.  If the beginning, which is shown at the end, hadn't been done so well, this form of showing the movie would be terrible.  It is, however, very effective in this case.<br />As Leonard continues his backward search, he meets up with both allies and enemies, most of those he meets are both.  Everyone seems to take advantage of his memory problem is some shape or form.  A personal favorite is the hotel worker who rents him out two rooms, even though he only uses one at a time.  At the end of the movie, most people won't belive that the movie is over.  The ending really seems to leave you hanging.  But this is only because the ending is the beginning and the real ending is shown at the beginning of the movie.  If you think about what happened during the movie, it should all add up.<br />This movie isn't for everybody, though.  If you talk during the movie or someone talks to you during the movie, you'll miss something.  If you watch the whole movie with no or very few interruptions, you will be greatly rewarded with the privalige of watching (and hopefullly understaing) an amazing film.  This movie may be too fast paced for most, and not everyone will appreciate the backward story telling (it takes some getting used to), but ultimately this film is worth watching, even if it's only to be able to discuss the ending endlessly with those who watch the movie with you.
0767805712|5.0|I'm not a person who's into all those &quot;robot&quot; &quot;sci fi&quot; movies but I decided to watch this movie with a friend.  I love this movie.  I own it and think it's just great.  The story, the actors, the world they have to live in, all fascinating.  Just recommended by me is all I have to say;
B00005J9M3|5.0|I can't even begin to say how incredible this CD is. Like their other albums, Behaviour perfectly showcases Neil and Chris' ever-evolving genius. Songs like Being Boring and Nervously can move you to tears; So Hard and Jealousy bring back that feeling of despair and dejection you felt when your boyfriend dumped you. If you want to make your experience COMPLETE: buy the rerelease of the album with the additional CD: Further Listening. The best track is Jealousy (extended version). It is the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard, possibly comparable to the classical genius of Mozart and Beethoven.  Cheers to the Pet Shop Boys for creating almost 20 years of beautiful, ironic, fun, introspectively dark, and timeless music. The songwriting of Tennant/Lowe, so underappreciated here in the states, definitely has and will always leave its mark on history. Ciao!
B00003CX8J|4.0|I was a fan of the old &quot;X-Men&quot; series on FOX, so I'm not a total<br />rookie with the series.<br />It seems to me that the movie was for all intents and purposes a two-character film, with Rogue and Wolverine taking center stage(and doing quite well at it).<br />There were a few missing elements (If I remember correctly Mystique is Rogue's Mother!), but the action was tight and fast.<br />I hope the sequel irons some of these loose ends out--and gets everyone's favorite Cajun, Gambit, on board!
B00000D9TK|5.0|I am a Chinese girl and my english is just OK (not to say I know any french) but then, you really do not have to know the language to be able to enjoy the CD.  You can just feel Ms Dion's beautiful voice and the excellent music.  &quot;S'il Suffisait D'Aimer&quot;(&quot;If Only Love Could Be Enough&quot;) is the best of the CD.
0553106635|5.0|One of the best series I've ever read! The characters are distinct and thoroughly, each with their own goals and triumphs and failures - no one is too evil to be lucky, or too central to the plot to fail.<br />It's intricate and involved - don't expect to enjoy it if you can't stand something with depth and subplots.  Have a little patience, and it'll pan out.<br />And, *finally*, a fantasy series where magic isn't just pouring out people's ears.  It's rare, thankfully - which helps it retain its identity as *magic*.<br />Now if we could only hurry along the next book... ::grumbles::
1878424432|5.0|During the past year I have spent at least ... on reading materials, most of which I ordered through Amazon.com. This wonderful gift to myself...\\"The Four Agreements\\" by Don Miguel Ruiz was so enlightening to me I immediately ordered ten more copies from Amazon.com for my friends!! So, there you have it...never in my life have I ordered more than three of the same book, even for family and friends.<BR>This is your inner personal moral compass. More than that it teaches you the lessons our parents and clergy SHOULD have. It is the wisest book outside the Bible.<BR>Wonderfully writen and easily comprehended. Thank you Don Miguel Ruiz!
B00005B4GU|5.0|pyramid song, i might be wrong, like spinning plates???? come on! this is anything BUT left-overs. while it isn't kid b, it is still fantastic, and definetly worth the 14$ or whatever you spend. buy, buy, buy. thom deserves it.
0767849493|4.0|This is one of those movies that will lose a lot of it's humour if you take things to seriously.  This will be obvious as soon as you read the &quot;disclaimer&quot; at the beginning.  If you have any grasp on religion (Catholisism in particular) this movie is a laugh riot from beginning to end, but as i stated before, people who take things too seriously might be outraged by statements such as &quot;Jesus was a black man&quot; or &quot;God is a woman&quot; or the existance of a black &quot;13th apostle&quot; named Rufus.  If you can agree with, deal with, accept, and/or see the humour in these statements you will understand the true comedy of this film.  If you are very religious and easily offended, this movie will probably not appeal to you.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall has once again given us a treasure of music and style. The Look of Love presents a collection of light jazz and bossa nova sounds perfect for a quiet evening.<br />Mixed with lush orchestration and a soft nightclub feel, listeners will be whisked away into this dreamy and calming cd.<br />My favorites were S'Wonderful and The Look of Love. After awhile though all the tracks sounds the same BUT no matter, each one is still great and its worth more than 5 stars. Diana's sultry voice gives amazing character to these songs.<br />I just hope her next one will be a full fledged Christmas album!!! Please?? :)
B00005N9CV|1.0|Diana Krall used to be a jazz piano player who also was a singer. That description is no longer accurate for her most recent work. I don't think the music on &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is jazz music. There is precious little jazz piano playing, or any kind of piano playing at all. There are some easy listening vocals and there is a lot of orchestral string music. There is very little of anything that swings. Even songs that could benefit from some more up tempo pacing, like &quot;I Remember You&quot;, are slow and lethargic. If you like easy listening female vocals, sort of like &quot;smooth jazz&quot; with a smokey voice, perhaps you will find something of value here. I didn't. Miss Krall's &quot;All for You&quot; remains my favorite of her several recordings. That was jazz piano playing and singing. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is something else entirely. Look at the photography accompanying the CD box, and you can tell what is being sold. I am sorry, but it is not what I want to buy and listen to. Good luck to you in your new smooth jazz career, Miss Krall, I sorry but I won't be around to listen any more.
B000002TQV|5.0|although this is not radiohead's best, it is still magnificent. i would reccomend it to anybody who was even slightly interested in radiohead, as it is a nice introduction to radiohead.
B000059PQ5|4.0|Don't listen to any claims made made for Bullet For A General, Django is without a doubt the best non-Leone spaghetti Western of all time.  The opening scene (blue-clad Nero carrying a saddle over his shoulder and dragging a coffin through the gooiest mud in film history)is beautiful.  Corbucci's direction is more controlled here than anywhere else--less zooms, less jarring close-ups, and neater editing.  And Django has to be one of the first action heroes to fire a heavy machine gun from the hip (without even pulling the trigger, no less!).<br />But make no mistake.  This is Italian exploitation--love it or hate it.  An ear is cut off, prostitutes fight in the mud, and our hero's hands are crushed in gory detail that would make One-Eyed Jacks mumble in disgust.  Don't expect John Ford here.  But if you're looking for something different, are curious about spaghetti Westerns but afraid to buy any because so many are horrible--then this is the movie for you!
B00005IC2H|5.0|this is multi-platinum in iceland. i can only imagine what it's like over there. this is dreamlike. i love it, love it, love it. don't shy away from the fact that it's sung in icelandic either. IT DOESN\\"T MAKE A DIFFERENCE! it is beautiful.

B00005N9CV|2.0|I saw Diana Krall at Blues Alley in DC, which holds some 50 people, some years back. One of the best concerts I ever saw. She had a trio with her. She and the accompanyists played long breaks - 15 minutes of instrumentals and 2-3 minutes of singing. There was lots of well joined interaction with the bass and guitar in the trio.<br />I'm sure this CD will be popular with a lot of people. The cover and inside pictures show us a lot of skin and Diana in almost pinup poses. She sings a lot of slow ballads - I usually like ballads.<br />I eargerly anticipated this CD. It is a profound disappointment. I have to say this CD is listless and energy-less. Diana sleepwalks through the perfomances. She hits a few keys here and there but there is little or none of the Nat King Cole style piano which graced her earlier albums. She is overwhelmed by a sea of syrupy violins. I can't believe she enjoys doing this stuff.<br />Maybe she can make a deal with Verve. One album of schlocky orchestrated ballads followed by one album of trio work where she gets to play her sparkling piano parts and the singing is minimal. That's what she does best and what she obviously enjoys.<br />For much better Diana Krall with energy , buy &quot;All for You&quot; or perhaps &quot;Love Scenes&quot;.
0748662731|5.0|After stumbling upon \\"The # 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" I was so eager to read the sequels that I managed, at great travail, to track them down even before their publication dates in the U.S.  Never before have I searched out books so vigilantly, and never before have I written a review. <BR>  \\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" and \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" are even less strictly mysteries that the first in the series, but they are just as wonderful as \\"#1...\\".  Light reading but with a literary bent, the books contain rich characters, uniquely African and clearly depicted.  The ones we know well are big-hearted, kind, well-meaning.  <BR>  The main character, Precious, solves the few actual mysteries in the sequels in creative ways that surprise the reader.  These sequels, particularly \\"Giraffe,\\" are a bit more about Precious' relationship with J.L.B. Matekoni, a bit less about the detective agency.  But they follow smoothly from \\"#1 Ladies...\\" and are equally good.  Set in Botswana, the books give such a clear and beautiful picture of that country today that now I would like to learn more about it.  If the books are realistic, Botswanians fiercely love their home.  <BR>  Nothing raunchy in any of the 3 books.  Terrific \\"reads.\\"
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall's been around on CD since 1989 and has released 5 albums (I think!) since then. I've seen her live 4 times and she's one of those artists who is 100 times better live; not to say that her albums aren't great - its just that she is an incredibly accomplished jazz pianist who plays with a cheeky sense of humour which makes listening a joy, sometimes on CD that doesn't always come across.<br />This latest album is more of a Jazz standards album (as the tracklisting indicates) than she's ever done before. For my money, it's incredibly well produced and played but misses some of the humour you can glean off albums like Love Scenes (track &quot;Peel Me A Grape&quot;) and When I Look In Your Eyes (track &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot;) - both are worth owning. Stil though, if you're already a fan then this is a &quot;must have&quot; and espescially with the great arranger Claus Ogerman who was dragged out of retirement for this album. Diana's singing has never been this polished and its a joy to listen to.<br />If you like listening to some of the greats: Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Julie London, Ella Fitzgerald, etc. then Diana Krall will be a great addition to those names. And if you like this album then definitely check out her last two (mentioned above) or for more of those lush string arrangements from Claus Ogerman check out the classic 1969 Oscar Peterson album: &quot;Motions &amp; Emotions&quot;. Simply Brilliant.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I prayed that Brit's wouldn't make it into my house, but alas!, my mislead brother has purchased it.  I asked him how it was, and all he could say was &quot;she's hot&quot;.  Perhaps Brit has changed, I try to reason, as I popped &quot;Oops, I Did It Again&quot; into my cd player.  It couldn't possibly be as bad as &quot;Baby, One More Time&quot;, her debut cd.  I wanted to give her a chance.  How could this be??  OIDIA! is actually WORSE than BOMT! As my friend below has stated, Brit has blantantly and unabashedly raped and violated the pop music scene with such mutilated tracks as &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Knockin' On My Door&quot;, not to mention the poorly covered &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.  Yes, Britney may be a teen who is sweet, beautiful and even &quot;innocent&quot;, but we all can clearly see that talent that NOTHING to do with her success.
B00005JIZA|5.0|This is the best album from a newcomer I've heard in a long time, maybe ever. Song structure is interesting, wonderful chords, wonderful chord changes, intelligent lyrics, great voice. This kid is incredibly talented for such a young age. His music is sophisticated, yet easy to listen to. Heavily jazz-influenced, but kind of pop-py too. Very engaging. I saw him live recently on acoustic with just a bass player, and it was great. Knock your socks off. I predict John Mayer will be the next big thing.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is one of the most important movies ever made. Film-making wise, it is brilliant: Sharp slick camera work, well controlled computer effects, an original plot and most importantly, beautiful performances from a perfect cast. Life-wise, the movie touched on the very basis of modern human existence. We do not need this movie to tell us that humans are a pile of crap. For every micro-chip that we make work faster, we shoot another point up in the moron meter. Those who bash this film for it's violence doesn't see that the fighting was therapy for these guys, the same as those ridiculous groups were for Norton's character in the beginning. Those who bash the film for Tyler's project mayhem missed the point that his idea did not work out. One of the main themes that evolved during the film was that cults do not work, the space monkeys became morons. Tyler became a Hitler. Fight club was a beautiful dream that was filled with so much promise,but it went wrong and the ending showed it's result. At the end of the day, the one word used to coin this film would be controversial. Anything that causes such applause and condemnation is glorious in my opinion.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This is the DVD you should have in your library if you're a CARRIE addict like myself. Wonderful extras include one documentary about the actual making of the movie, another one is angled from the acting standpoint. One extra: \\"The Musical Carrie\\" was dissapointing because there was nothing from the musical! It was merely discussed. [...] Of course, there's the fantastic movie that never bores. Performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are among the screen's greatest. It's fascinating to see them today, on the documentary, discussing how they created their roles, their problems. [...]
B00005N9CV|4.0|An excellent performance as a follow-up to When I Look In Your Eyes. I can't say I'm as impressed with it as I was with the last release, but she's still amazing. Her renditions of The Night We Called It A Day and Cry Me a River are the perfect expressions of bittersweetness. Her versatile voice really comes through. I'm not too happy with the fact that she's showing a lot more skin on her albums (CD insert has her displaying serious cleavage). I think she's a classy woman who's fallen prey to some marketing vices. Sure, she's an attractive woman, but I think her talents are enough to carry her far. Okay, I admit that if she looked like Sandra Bernhard, that might change things toward the downside for me.
B00004U60I|5.0|This is one of the more boring videos in this series.  However it still keeps my son entertained.  It is all music based.  It is obivous that this is one of there earier more low budget ones.  And this is like torture for adults to have to endure.  However it will keep you little one glued to the tv for 20-30 minutes.  This one has no education value.  For you first video get Baby shakespear or van gogh
B000002UYZ|5.0|I own both this album and its companion piece (aka the &quot;blue album&quot;).  I prefer this one, but I prefer early Beatles in general.  This is an outstanding collection of early hits that show the Beatles as real groundbreakers in the fledgling rock scene.  From &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to &quot;Yesterday,&quot; from &quot;Help&quot; to &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; there is not a bad track here.  My favorite early Beatles piece, &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; is the second track.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up -- it's a great collection of hits, all in one place.
B000002HMH|1.0|If you started listening to Metallica post Black Album, you may like this album and all similar to it.  I'm from the fan base that started listening to the group with Kill Em All.  I can't stand the new stuff they are doing.<br />I'm so disappointed, I can't even begin to explain. If they could get a bass player with the same energy and feel that Cliff Burton had, maybe they could redeem themselves.<br />It's not any different than the rest of the industry I guess.  Everyone has sold out, died or just suck now... Megadeath, Testament, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest...  At least Slayer is trying to maintain their roots.<br />Come on Metallica, do something for the old fans at lease once!!!!!!!
B000002UZ1|4.0|I own both this collection (aka the &quot;blue album&quot;) and its companion piece (aka the &quot;red album&quot;).  I admit that I prefer the earlier collection, but I also prefer earlier Beatles music in general.  That said, this is a good collection of the Beatles' best music from their later years (e.g., &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; &quot;Sgt. Pepper/With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;) and is a great way to pick up the best hits in one place.
B00005AFVR|5.0|The more I listen to this CD, the better I like it and the more blown away I am by Bruce as a performer. I'd kind of lost interest in him after his Born in the U.S.A. album and his live CD boxed set back in the late 1980s, not caring for Tunnel of Love or Lucky Town all that much. But this CD brings back the best of Bruce's old stuff (like Born to Run, Out in the Street, Two Hearts) and adds some great newer songs (Land of Hope and Dreams). The classic Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out is a terrific, 16-minute track where Bruce has a lot of fun with the audience and honors the E-Street Band, and The River, never one of my favorites, is as close to a perfect song as I've heard sung. But more than anything, what comes through is Bruce's heart and passion in every syllable he sings. How his voice holds up, I'll never know. Even in restrained songs, his energy is just barely contained. He goes all out, all the time.
0689505698|5.0|My mother in law has long been animatedly telling my three yr old the story of the three little pigs whenever we're stuck in the car for a while-- and he loved every minute of it, every time. My husband and I were already big fans of Helen Oxenbury (Check out &quot;We're Going On a Bear Hunt&quot;)-- so when we saw this, we were sold. But we had no idea we'd instantly love it *this* much. Other reviewers have given away it's secrets--suffice it to say that I was not expecting the pig to pull out a drill, or the wolves to refer to all the tea leaves in thier china tea pot! I'm more than willing to read it to my son again and again-- and that's saying a lot for a children's book. I'm online right now getting it for my neice who will be one in 3 days-- but I'm really getting it for my brother ;o)
B000056K04|4.0|Well I'll keep it short.  Great CD and worth the money.  Not quite as good as his others, and it's a completely different style.  However it's still great, and it's still Dave.  Buy the CD - you'll like it.  And if you don't...well I'm sorry.
0792101448|5.0|The opening  hour title sequence is one of the best ever filmed. It sets the eerie mood for the entire film. The skill in which suspense is built using the the camera and ambient sound is astounding. It's almost too much at some points. The photography, including crane shots, combined with Ennio Morricone's excellent score also add greatly to this film, as with the earlier Clint Eastwood &quot;Dollars&quot; Trilogy. Leone's style just kept developing. There are significant differences between this film and the Dollars Trilogy. The Eastwood films are action based and have more humorous elements. Once Upon a Time In The West is deadly serious--there is no humor. But this film also has elements in common, such as the importance of the score and the way the story is conveyed with very little dialogue. The grand scope is reminiscent of &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.&quot; Much has been made of Eastwood being Leone's first choice for the Harmonica character. In retrospect, however, Bronson was the perfect choice. Its hard to imagine anybody playing this role better. For example, when he responds to being one horse short with &quot;You brought two too many&quot; he makes this character his own. Bronson's character is more brooding than Eastwood's more enigmatic character and has a deep grudge that motivates him throughout. This film needs a re-mastered DVD release.
B00005N9CV|3.0|The Look of Love CD Diana Krall's latest is a true gem. She is the &quot;Sinatra&quot; of our era, by giving the lyrics the feeling they were meant to have. It is not only  easy listening but soothing as well. Her soft piano touch and background music can really set the mood.  Each cut is a masterpiece.  &quot;Cry Me a River has always belonged to Julie London... until now. Diana has captured that and all the others in her own unique style that seperates her from today's vocalists.  She is in top form for this one and we can only look forward to more and more of Krall!! One listen and you'll be humming the cuts all day long.      Thank you Diana... you have arrived ... You will be around a long time.

B00005NZBN|5.0|Critics, jealous want a be musicians. Zealous folks with high hopes. Love and Theft - FIVE STARS. To think that Seeger wanted to axe the cable. Oh my soul, oh my spirit, take a stroll down Highway 61. Turn left at Maggie's Farm were you might spot the Thin Man Knockin' on Heaven's Door. Po' Boy he's a answering with a glass of poison wine. Meanwhile the Man In the Long Black Coat scores with Frankie Lee in Oxford Town. There'll be Country Pie tonight at the Highlands. Wiggle Wiggle, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum Under A Red Sky wishing on a barrow of whiskey. Bye and Bye Sugar Baby down in Mississippi while counting Summer Days with the Lonesome Day Blues. I wish everyone would stop labeling Bob and just listen to the music as it is and enjoy it. It's the lyrics, the voice, the guitar, piano, harmonica, drums, bass, organ and all the other instruments of life that make this recording a one of a kind piece of musical art. If you can relate you are one of the lucky ones. Do not be angry if your relation to the music has no relation to Bob's meaning. So buy this recording at once. Enjoy another painting of Bob's work. Five stars to the distant one  who comes a ridin' when the fog is low. Twelve more songs ring out in the night of night. Thanks Bob.
B00000APLB|4.0|Many of the reviews of Love You Live at the time of its release praised the El Mocambo set of 4 songs, which are very good, but the rest of the album, recorded live in Paris, is excellent as well.  For those partial to Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, Love You Live suffers by comparison, yet the opening numbers especially hold up well. Certainly the 1969 outfit was a lot tighter, but there is a lot of energy in If You Can't Rock Me and Star Star, as well as superb workouts on Fingerprint File and You Can't Always Get What You Want. Sympathy For the Devil is an acquired taste on this version, but I've grown to love it. The last word on this live album has to go to Charlie Watts, who is absolutely at his peak here. I love this album, call it sentimental value, but it works.  The Still Life collection of the 1981 tour is a big dropoff by comparison, that sounds very hurried and ragged.

B00005N9CV|4.0|Just want to say that this is a great collection of standards and near-standards.  Diana Krall has a fantastic voice, deep and smoky.  My only gripe is that the orchestrations tended to overpower her piano, which was a lot more prominent in her earlier albums.
B00005JKES|5.0|Full of secrets and mysteries for the viewer to explore, Twin Peaks endures. The show lasted only two seasons, yet over a decade later remains the top-selling boxed video set on Yahoo!'s charts time and time again, which is unquestionably a testament to the powerful writing and imagery.<br />I truly can't begin to do it justice. I can only respect and admire the brilliance of David Lynch and Mark Frost in this collaborative effort. It is richer than the American classic To Kill a Mockingbird. The original perspective on the heart of darkness lurking in a pristine small town may almost be as groundbreaking as Faulkner's unusual technique in The Sound and the Fury.<br />There are layers upon layers of symbolism in the series, and yet it manages high art without falling into pretentiousness for almost the whole series. It is good-humored and friendly: we grow to care for the quirky personalities of the town's characters and the town itself. This makes the balance of dream and waking, dark and light, yin and yang, fire and wood all the more personal.<br />I recommend watching the series prior to viewing the movie Fire Walk With Me.<br />As for the DVDs, I am excited about finally seeing the show clearly, in sharp contrast to the VHS box set - the decision to put approximately five episodes on each tape meant that the transfer was done at the lower quality Extended Play resolution, and they looked very grainy, indeed. However, in light of the fact that the VHS box set continues to sell well as of this writing, I wish they would just go ahead and make a box set, complete with features, interviews, high-quality sound and other extras. I don't want to buy 1-7, then wait for the rest. I want them all at once, perfect and permanent.  I'd almost rather wait a few extra months to have them all at once, rather than seeing them sell a few here, a few there. I'm a huge fan, and have even done a Twin Peaks panel at a convention, so I strongly feel that the series and FWWM DVDs needto be immaculate.  It has proven itself as a lasting classic, and deserves the full treatment.<br />Despite that technical drawback, I'm thrilled that the series will finally be available on DVD. Either way you view it, the content is well worth it for those who are willing to peek into the subconscious without unraveling all the packaging and thus, all the mystery. The mystery has value in and of itself.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I've been listening to Dylan for 36 years, and I'm always amazed a how effortlessly he breaks his own mold. This is a wonderful album and, of all things, it's danceable! (I teach dance). But only Dylan can swing Summer Days with his unique and teasing lyrics and his one-of-a-kind authentic, listen-to-me voice. Remember, lots of artists have taken his songs over the years and prettied them up, but who wants that? Let the man wail, he's beautiful. I also loved Lonesome Day blues (down and dirty), the lilting Bye and Bye, Moonlight, and the very moving Po' Boy. And true to form, he drops memorable lines right and left as if he can't unload them fast enough. Brother, you are anything but a &quot;worn out star&quot;. I've succeeded in turning one of my sons onto Dylan, and I would convert the world if I could. I'm not a musician, but it also seems to me that he and his band have a tight, professional, practiced sound in this album, which I assume is the product of being years on the road. In conclusion, let me add that we waste our time (and his), if we constantly compare anything he does to his sixties work, Blood on the Tracks, or whatever. Take this album as it is. Listen to it closely, and be thankful that in these days of mass music marketing we have an enduring genius of a songwriter who, bless his heart, is still with us.
B00005N9CV|3.0|It could just be me, but I'm afraid The Look of Love is not Diana's strongest work (that title would fall to her last CD).<br />The Look of Love sounds over-orchestrated.  And the song selection seems a little wanting.  Plus, Diana's excellent piano playing seems to be missing here.  I'm afraid that the record company is trying to make her a big star, and they've taken control of everything they can to make her a star.  Nothing worse in the music industry than when this happens.
B000002B1M|5.0|First off, I don't wanna mention &quot;Illmatic&quot;, but I have to. This album definetly shows Nas' growth from his CLASSIC debut album, &quot;Illmatic&quot;. I really love how complete this album is, there are songs of all different types of topics, and Nas' does them only like he can do. Like the DJ Premier &quot;I Gave You Power&quot;, where Nas personifies himself as a gun. Or &quot;Black Girl Lost&quot; featuring Jo jo(from Jodeci), a song in which Nas talks about the modern day american black female, and how lost from her culture she is. Other producers to name on da album are Trackmasters, Dr.Dre, &amp; Havoc. My personal favorite song on da album is &quot;Take It In Blood&quot;. This album also features da last The Firm song wit Cormega, &quot;Affirmative Action&quot;, to be honest, I really like The Firm much betta wit Nature. Wit songs like &quot;If I Ruled The World(Imagine That)&quot; wit Lauryn Hill, &quot;Street Dreams&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Message&quot;, Nas certainly professes himself as not only a rhymer, but also a thinker. This a definite must have for any rap fan, from 1996-2001 this album is still gettin heavy rotation in my cd player, &quot;Imagine That&quot;.
B000050HTO|5.0|A grouping triumph of Dylan's best and most influential songs. The hit recording quality as expected was superior to previous release undertakings. Mr. Genius Songwriter himself no doubt would give sincere thanks that these many years later people still continue to forward honorable dedication to his music as always they have in the past. To my trivial disappointment, two favorite `essential` songs were left out from this hit listing(s). However, as the majority of other reviewers have pointed out, one cannot possibly get every personal favorite of such a song historian eclipsed onto two discs. Although his legendary chant `I Want You` and the relatively modern classic `Neighborhood Bully` from INFIDELS unfortunately were not included, I guess you can't keep all your golden earphones in two plastics! Enough said - truly an extraordinary compressed musical overview for any loyal R`n R enthusiast. Your songs always will be with us close at heart Bob, no matter what year or decade we represent...
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Great cd! As good as or better than the award winning Time Out of Mind. High points were Mississippi, the best song on the cd and rivals Not Dark Yet as his greatest recent song. Floater (too much to ask) was also a great song. Highwater(for Charlie Patton) had a hillbilly type melody to it but was also great. Then Po'boy and Sugar Baby was the other classics. Seen bob in Des Moines a month ago and it was great, this cd makes his comeback (again) complete.
B00004U8P9|5.0|&quot;I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey.&quot; To describe The Rocky Horror Picture Show as &quot;a strange journey&quot; is putting it mildly; RHPS is a full-on cinematic adventure blending comedy, raunchiness, science fiction, and addictive musical numbers. While not as shocking to today's audiences as it must have been to its first viewers in the 1970s, RHPS still packs in plenty of sex, laughs, and rock 'n' roll.<br />RHPS has something for everyone.  Who can resist a movie starring Tim Curry as a sweet transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania who creates lovers during his spare time like an erotic Dr. Frankenstein? Can anyone keep himself/herself from dancing the Time Warp or singing along to such show-stopping musical hits like &quot;Toucha-Toucha-Toucha Touch Me,&quot; &quot;Damnit Janet,&quot; and &quot;Hot Patootie?&quot; For ladies like myself, this movie contains a wonderfully muscular stud named Rocky clad only in a little gold speedo and matching boots. For the men, a very young Susan Sarandon parades around in her bra and undies. Toss in a hilariously nonsensical plot, plenty of places for audience participation, memorable catch phrases, and a cameo by Meatloaf... Who could ask for more?<br />The 25th Anniversary DVD contains plenty of extras that any RHPS fan will love. You get interviews, different movie viewing options, an awesome screensaver, and more. Don't forget to search for the hidden &quot;easter eggs&quot; on this 2-disc set. You'll love this movie, and be prepared to buy the original soundtrack!
0451163532|3.0|This was an interesting look at something that really happened. Unfortunately, it did not read like a normal historical adventure novel. It was more like a nonfiction account with some novel material thrown in here and there to try to keep you interested. I read the first 100 pages or so and began to grow disinterested. Finally, I stopped altogether.
B000002KNY|4.0|This was my first Talking Heads album, and frankly it took me a long time to get into it. I originally got it only because my sister Julie shared vocals with Eno and Byrne on &quot;I Zimbra&quot;. Gradually songs that had at first seemed only obtuse and impenetrable began to reveal themselves to me. Some, like &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; and &quot;I Zimbra&quot; were catchy enough that by the second or third listen, they had implanted themselves in my brain. Others took much longer. Gradually I began noticing the lyrics. Incredible, paranoid, psychedelic, insane, insightful lyrics. It was like a glimpse into the mind of a brilliant madman. I think Byrne must have been taking a LOT of acid when he wrote these songs. &quot;Air hits me in the face. I run faster, faster into the air. And I say to myself, 'What is happening to my skin? Where is the protection that I need?' Air can hurt you too.&quot; The song &quot;Animals&quot; carries the paranoia to hysterical extremes. To this day, when I pull this one out of the collection for a listen, the motivation is the great lyrics.
0446677450|4.0|I have more sophisticaded books of acounting, taxes and financial management since I'm a financial manager. I found Rich dad poor dad to be a good book, It doesn't have formulas but it does have true ideas, financial formulas are not the clue to get rich. this book worths reading it, it has ideas you don't learn at college, ideas rich don't want to give away so easily.
B000002KZ6|5.0|This is the Talking Heads' finest album because this is the one that strikes a perfect balance between the pop sensibilities displayed on &quot;Talking Heads `77&quot; and &quot;More Songs About Buildings And Food&quot;, and the adventurous experimentalism of &quot;Fear Of Music&quot; and, especially, &quot;Remain In Light&quot;. On &quot;Speaking In Tongues&quot; the best elements of all that came before gel into a stunning, delicious, exquisite work that manages to be simultaneously complex, deep, infectious, incredibly catchy, and profoundly fun. This was the blueprint that all subsequent Talking Heads albums followed, but never again with the same degree of success.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Wow... there's not much to say when your jaw's hanging open. <br /> This album is destined to be a classic of its time. The length and sequence recall the days when most recordings had to fit on two sides of vinyl, and so they were crafted with concise perfection. Poses is exactly that: not overlong, not too short; the opening track and it's reprise at the end act as bookends to a carefree yet impossibly grounded set of music.<br /> Wainwright's biggest asset is his voice; it swirls and floats miles above the jaunty piano tunes and dirge-y ballads. The songs themselves are very catchy and well written, without the clichés of pop circa 2001. All these attributes would make quite a good album, and they do; the coup de grace, though, are the lyrics. An example: <br /> &quot;If I should buy jellybeans<BR> Have to eat them all in just one sitting<BR> Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter,<BR> A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me&quot;<br /> With original lyrics, great songs and a fantastic voice, this record (and to a slightly lesser extent, his self-titled debut as well) is recommended for just about everyone. Just click the buy me button already.
0790742780|4.0|I saw this movie and liked it a lot except the producers had a potential white male hero, so they decided &quot;Oh yeah, let's turn him into a psychotic husband.&quot;  This could have been a great movie...It was however, one additional  reason for the above mentioned rage.  The ending was flat as day old beer.  B.

0785731490|4.0|Despite everyone knowing the basic plot, the story does enfold into a nice mystery (though not really a horror story).  A hideous man, Mr. Hyde, suddenly appears out of nowhere and seems to befriend a likable Dr. Jekyl.  Mr. Hyde lives in his residence and enigmatically stays there for long periods of a time.  Only later on does his friends and acquaintances find out that Dr. Jekyl is Mr. Hyde.<br />This novella is an engrossing tale of a divided man.  This mystery, though already known, is a great tale worthy of being a classic.  For a book written over a hundred years ago, it's suprisingly readable, mysterious in the beginning, and exciting at the end.  Even the different narratives hightens this tale.<br />I recommend this book.  It's a good, short mystery.
0064407667|5.0|Yes, I like the fact that the author defines words on every page. I think its funny. I also like his examples of the words, and how he sometimes leaves the story to talk about something else. While the plots aren't alway my favorite, I like the way Lemony Snicket writes. The Bad Begining isn't my favorite in the series, and I think they get better as they go along. I love the 2nd and 3rd and especially the 6th.
0156711427|3.0|Forester portrays India through a few main characters in an Indian city called Chandrapore.  He describes an incident concerning an English school teacher, a local Muslim doctor, and two English woman.  He tries, and the keyword here is &quot;tries&quot;, to show the racial and cultural tensions between the English rulers and the Indian locals.  <br />The way the people are presented in this book is a joke.  The main character, Aziz, is laughable.  He's unbelievably subservient.  Also, the portrayal of Hindus is almost clownlike, and the English are presented as extreme snobs.  Forester's India should not be taken as a true representation of India at all.<br />The first half is barely readable.  The language is not too fluid, and the action is slow.  One of my main gripes is that Forester interludes a lot dialog without referring to who is speaking.  It's quite disconcerting.  The second half is much better.  It concentrates on a trial, and the aftermath on friendship.  I was able to read this half in one sitting.<br />The story itself is enjoyable.  The aspects of justice, prejudice and friendship penetrates this novels story in every way.  If this book was about some anonymous countrymen in an anonymous country, this would be well worth the price.<br />I recommend this book, but as a story, and not as a cultural portrayal.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Rain Dogs is one of the greatest albums that no one else on my college campus has heard of. Waits is an incredible songwriter, in the top class with only a handful of others. This is an interesting album in that it may be called a Waits sampler album. He has the rough jazz/blues with the growling lyrics that some of his albums are known for and the ballads that others are known for. His experimental blues tracks are incredible, Singapore, Clap Hands, Jockey Full of Bourbon are all great songs. His voice adds to the texture and realism of the characters. The true highlights of the album, to me, are the slower songs, Time, Downtown Train, and Anywhere I Lay my Head, which rips my soul out every time. The placement of the instrumental tracks is interesting in its obvious strategy. One is after the title track because after that song, the sheer power of it, the listener needs some time to cool down; then between Downtown Train and Anywhere I Lay my Head, because the songs would be too much back to back. Waits voice is an interesting instrument. Tori Amos was on Letterman last night and performed Time. She did a very good job, putting all of herself in the song and the audience loved it. However Waits is in that regard is like Dylan. You can cover the songs, but no one can sing Dylan like Dylan, and no one can sing Tom Waits like the man himself. That voice is incredible.
B000002BSV|5.0|yes to be honest there's no<BR>6. Lazy/CD-Rom Track<BR>7. CD-Rom Track<BR>but the rest is true,Suede great returning to the music and this is my first Suede record ever...i highly recommend this masterpiece to every music fan.
B00000K2SC|1.0|After having heard from everyone I know that this movie was going to blow my mind and change the way I think, I was very dissapointed.  Yes, the special effects are incredible, but for the love of pete people, Total Recall already did the whole what we see may only be illusion concept (and Descartes did it much further back with Meditations on First Philosophy).  If you want to watch a mindless sci fi shoot 'em up action flick and still think you are smart because it has such a &quot;deep&quot; meaning behind it, then by all means see this movie.  Otherwise don't waste your time.  The fact that Keanu is front and center on the cover ought to say something.  And if you just want to see Carrie Anne Moss (sp?), see Memento instead.  At least that has something interesting to say about memory and the idea of narrative structure.
B00005AMKO|5.0|yes this cd is a rare import,i dont have it but i got the Europe release and that My Insatiable One 7'' flexi given away at Brixton gig and MSO-acoustic piano version is just wonderful as usual...i suggest you buy this,if you have money :)
B00004Z459|4.0|[...]P>Paper cut- pretty much starts the sound of the album, i dont really like the song that much... it sounds like the papa roach im not to fond of. i give it a 6.<br />One step closer- i like almost the entire song but its way to averplayed and it gets anoying after about 3 plays. i give it an 8.<br />With you- the intro sounds alot like it could be the intro to a korn song, and the screaming singer sounds alot like jon davis in the chorus, sounds unoriginal. I give it a 7.<br />Points of authority- i particuarly like the whispering without the guitars, i think the rest of the song is mediocre. I give it a 6.5<br />Crawling- GREAT song. GREAT Chorus. Original melody. very smooth sound during the verses to a HUGE bang of sound great sound. only problem is it is somewhat repetative I give it a 9.5<br />Runaway- I heard this song on a CD-R mix at a friends house. I couldnt get it out of my head for days. Very catchy chorus. Not very original sound from crawling the whisper-rap-loud-techno-whisper-rap-loud-techno-rap-loud-techno. I give it a 9.<br />By myself- sad sounding, sorta depressing, very good smooth sounding verses, very catchy chorus. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WEIRD SOUND EFFECT THEY HAVE IN BETWEEN THE VERSE AND CHORUS. I CANT STAND THAT, i cant listen to this song long enough to enjoy it =). I give it a 7.5<br />In the end- Definately the best song on the album, some of the little rap i do like. I LOVE THE PIANO. it ads a creepy great sound to the song. my god i cant explain how much i love the piano sound in this, it reminds me of resident evil - CV, i love this song so much, LINKIN PARK ADD MORE PIANO TO YOUR SONGS!,  i personally think the album is worth it for this one song. I give it a 10!<br />A place for my head- very cool sounding melody that is very catchy. Rap is good too. i love that guitar melody. the chorus doesnt really fit the song tho. I give it a 7.5<br />Forgotten- I dont really like this song so much, the chorus is pretty good though. I giveit a 6.5<br />Cure for an itch- very weird beggining, but very cool sounding, once the strings and piano come in it sounds the best, alot like a moby song or something, very cool and a very good idea. I give it a 9(a 9 instead of a 10 because the song is sorta repeptative)<br />Pushing me away- Like alot of the songs on this cd, it sounds alot like crawling, but it sounds pretty good. but still the same whisper-rap-loud-techno-whisper-rap-loud-techno-rap-loud-techno, method. I give it an 8.<br />There are 2 really good songs not on this cd only the japan import which i have so ill reveiw those also<br />My December- Very cool song, sounds a little like staind, sad song, the chorus is \\"beautiful\\" hehe i cant belive i actually said that, but it is very repetative, just expect the same song played 3 times. I give it a 9.<br />High Voltage- a pure rap song with some synthesized voices and cool dj effects, if i was a rap fan (which im not) i would like this song. The backround sounds alot like its in final fantasy 7. I give it a 7.5<br />good album, download a few songs, see if u like it, [...]
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This is a great movie that requires multiple viewings, but the thing that bugs me a little about this DVD is that its a bit thin on the extras. Its got trailers and an interview with Christopher Nolan, but that's about it.<br />What would have been great would be the ability to watch the film in the correct order. Sure it wouldn't have been as interesting, but would help clear more then a few things up.
0783239955|5.0|The Dinner Game is a movie not-based on an unfamilar premise: a group of snobby French men have a dinner to see who can invite the biggest idiot. The person who brings the biggest idiot to the dinner is deemed the winner. This concept has been done before however Thierry Lhermitte's take on this theme is done with class, spunk, and wit so much so that it will leave you enjoying every minute of this movie. This was the best *comedy* that I saw in 2000, period and is not slap-stick nor high-school comedy which has been popularized by American Pie and American Pie 2. People of all ages can appreciate this movie, even your mom or dad who are always doubting your taste in movies! :) I highly recommend you purchase or rent this movie.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Its good to see the Phantom Menace on DVD. This disc is worth its cheap price for the extras alone. Mr. Lucas finally delivered and did he ever to the tune of a few hours of extra stuff. He even went back and re-did special effects and sequences he cut-out for the theatrical release.<br />I know everyone slammed this movie, but its not all that bad. Actually, its a fun ride in familiar territory. Here's looking forward to Ep. 2 come May 2002.
B00003CXP1|4.0|This film is definately great but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. If you are able to handle scenes of an extremely disturbing nature then go for it you won't be dissapointed. But, if you are at all sqeamish  than this is not for you. Even though I'm not a drug user I would have to say that this film probably portrays drug use better than any other movie. It was so intense that at the end I felt like I was on narcotics. So in conclusion if you can handle it this is an enthrolling film which will effect you deeply. But, probably not worth buying because you won't want to watch it a second time. ....

B00005N9CV|2.0|Unfortunately, Ms. Krall's follow-up album to the phenomenal &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; is as disappointment. The song selection is unstimulating at best, boring and pathetic at worst. Even her voice seems out of sync, and her normally stunning intonations are all wrong.  The title cut which is a great song, seems dull and unimaginative. <br />It seems that her fame and noteriety has caught up with her artistic capabilities and dulled her creative possibilities.  Why did Tommy LiPuma let this be released?  An utterly boring and disappointing album from an artist on the verge of stardum.  Again, the album cover focuses too much on her looks.  Diana should be ashamed.  This time her music does not equal her looks.
0441008356|4.0|_Revelation Space_ belongs to a subgenre of hard science fiction that I label &quot;eschatalogical&quot; SF; that is, science fiction that attempts to explain the history of the universe, or at least a big enough portion of it. SF on an almost infinite scale of both time and space. SF that portrays a universe with a purpose, a big, hidden purpose, the discovery of which motivates the characters in the novel and the revelation of which (pardon the pun) forms its denouement. (As examples, read all four of Fred Pohl's &quot;Heechee&quot; novels, or David Zindell's &quot;Neverness&quot; series.) Such works promise much; and they had better deliver, for little is more disappointing than something that dares and fizzles.<br />_Revelation Space_ definitely does not fizzle, but it didn't quite deliver on its great promise, either. Not that I didn't enjoy the journey. It's one of the few even hard SF books that really depends on the relativistic effect of high-speed interstellar travel. The bells and whistles of authorial imagination (intended to make you admire his creativity - in this case, the Pattern Jugglers, Conjoiners, Ultras, the Shrouds, etc.) are clever and convincing indeed; the shape of human society is very original - different enough from our own day to seem plausibly futuristic, yet recognizable enough so that we can care about the characters as humans with whom we still have something in common.<br />The plot is fascinating - you really want to know what happened to the Amarantins, you really want Sylveste to make his ultimate discovery. You just hope the revelations, when they come, will be shattering ENOUGH, that the payoff will be truly galactic in scope. And that's where _Revelation Space didn't quite fulfill its mighty promise. As with many epic books, the ending seemed a bit rushed; I often joke it's as if the author had a deadline, or a maximum word count, and had to finish the book within that artificial constraint. More likely, it is simply difficultto articulate an ultimate vision, to get on paper what you feel in your spirit. <br />Don't get me wrong, Reynolds ties up all his many threads in a very neat package that doesn't even seem contrived. Yet what is going on behind the entire tale just doesn't seem quite powerful enough to have motivated the action. That's just my opinion. <br />_Revelation Space_ is one of my favorite novels of recent years, and I'm very sorry it didn't make the 2001 Hugo Ballot. It is complex (I almost wish it had an index!), involving, very high tech, and very futuristic. Reynolds has already published a sequel in the same universe called _Chasm City_, which is not yet available in the US (I picked up a copy from a British dealer at the Millennium Philcon). He is an author definitely worth watching, and I am looking very much forward to reading his works in the future.
0517209764|5.0|This is the Complete Works of Shakespeare, with a few illustrations, and nothing more. There are no annotations, and no modern introductions.<br />Some will fault this edition for its lack of annotations. I say that, although annotations are necessary for scholarly study of the Works, they can very much distract the reader who reads for pleasure. I find that half the fun of reading Shakespeare is trying to figure out what the meaning of the text is; annotations rob me of this.<br />I once had the misfortune of reading an annotated version of King Lear. At one point, King Lear makes an obscure, non sequitur remark (in Act 1, Scene 5). Was I given the opportunity to think about this remark, ponder it, decide for myself what this remark really meant? No: a footnote was there to do it for me. So I suggest you consider using a non-annotated edition for reading, and save the annotated versions for in-depth study.<br />Some might fault this edition for the quality of the binding. Although I am not an expert on bindings, I find the binding to be at least better than a typical paperback. Furthermore, the book is very lightweight; I would be surprised if it isn't the world's lightest Complete Works. For this reason, I find it surprisingly comfortable to hold as I read.<br />This edition comes with a ribbon sewn into the binding for use as a bookmark. Not only is the ribbon very useful, but it's also easy enough to cut off if it annoys you.<br />Some will fault this edition for the quality of the text. Indeed, the text has the character of an early twentieth century newspaper. I wouldn't be surprised if this edition was printed with plates from that time. Although not very clean, the text readable enough.<br />Probably the worst thing about this edition is the continuation lines--somtimes a long line will continue into empty space on the line above or below it. That takes some getting used to, especially since it's sometime ambiguous what line a continuation belongs to.<br />The best thing about this edition is the price, only about US$20.he best thing about this edition is the price, only about US$20.

B00005ABIP|5.0|Cake have been a favourite of mine for some time, and I have all their albums. If you are a new fan, try getting &quot;Comfort Eagle&quot; to start with, as it will give you more of an idea of what this amazing band are capable of. John McCrea is a true artist when it comes to his lyrics. As sardonic and witty as always, this album has spent many an hour in my CD deck. Basically, you can't go wrong with a Cake album, so, take my advice, buy them ALL!
B00005IC2H|5.0|I rarely write reviews, however I felt compelled to write on this album. It is, for lack of better words, amazing. As an earlier reviewer said, these are not songs, but compositions. Musical pieces. What is most interesting, is that this album originally was recorded in 1998, and it still sounds like it is from another world, another time. This is a monumental album. Mark my words.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Every time a new Dylan album comes out (unless it's really, really, bad) people say it's his best since &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;.  I'd like to say something else in this review, but I have to admit to myself that this time it really is the best since BOTT.  It's better than &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, which was better than just about anything back to &quot;Desire&quot;.<BR>    When we last left Bob, he had just finished TooM, an album whose prime focus sounded just like its acronym, if you know what I mean.  Dylan was fifty-six (or thereabouts) and had certainly become quite concious of his mortality.  What resulted was a brilliant but undeniably depressing album of songs about age and death.<BR>    Well, mortality's still on Bob's mind, but this time he's much cheerier about it.  &quot;Love and Theft&quot; has a wit in it that hasn't been seen since &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.  To hear him sing for twenty lines about aging and death, then suddenly say &quot;But stick with me, baby/Stick with me anyhow/Things are starting to get interesting right about now&quot; is just terrific.<BR>    Musically, the album is the clearest thing he's done for I don't know how long.  While &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; and &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;, the last two good albums he did that had more than just covers in them, had a muddy and dark sound to them (which worked for them), &quot;Love and Theft&quot; goes towards straight Fifties and Sixties rock n'roll and blues.  It's Dylan's tribute to what brought him here in the first place.  &quot;Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum&quot;, the musically and lyrically dark rocker that opens the album, promises us a great ride, and we aren't let down once.  The album's closer, the wistful and &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;-ish &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;, is wonderfully simple and creates an even more epic sense than &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; did four years ago.<BR>    After a Dylan of heavy hearts, death and whispers in the trees, it's nice to return to the Dylan who's listening to the trees saying something and &quot;trying to make out what it was/I tell myself something's coming but it never does.&quot;
B00003CXDV|4.0|Galaxy Quest is a funny movie that kids over the age of 5 will enjoy. It stars Tim Allen as an actor named Jason who stars as Captain Peter Quincy Taggart on a show called Galaxy Quest. But when aliens from another planet think that the show is real, they call on Jason and his 'crew' (Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, Daryl Mitchell)for help on defeating the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs).<br />This movie has very funny characters including Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), the leader of the aliens, Lalari (Missi Pyle from Josie &amp; the Pussycats), Fred (Tony Shalhoub)'s alien girlfriend and Quellek (Patrick Breen), Alexander (Alan Rickman)'s biggest alien fan. This is a great movie and one of Tim Allen's best.
B00004XONN|3.0|I can take or leave this album, but i feel incited to write a review as a few previous reviews assume dislike for Radiohead's current style equals stupidity, and that there are only two kinds of music:  teeny bopper stuff and the avant garde.  Obviously the middle ground is vast and wide and musical history has many albums made by famous people that bear some similarity to this, such as the work of the Future Sound of London, U2 on the Passengers album, and James on the Wah Wah album.  So it's best to rate this album in comparison with other Radiohead works instead of &quot;everything else out there.&quot;<br />Radiohead's best weapon has always been Thom's lyrics and voice, which is put to good use on some tracks, such as How to Disappear Completely and Everything in its Right Place, and on others it is weak and whiny when compared to past work, particularly on Morning Bell.  Lyrics are shrinking and if not obscured completely, like on the title track, are much less relatable to the listener.  What good are your ideas and opinions if only a select group of people can understand what you say?  The key word is pretension, the reason punk came along to wipe out progressive rock in the first place.<br />  Something that made Radiohead great in the past was that people could relate to the open-hearted sadness of &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, &quot;Black Star&quot; etc., and there's so little to relate to here, unless you are a paranoid clone, or an android, or whatever.  Whether for it's some kind of artistic statement or not, alienating your audience is a much different thing than trying to educate your audience and if you don't care about your audience then why are you releasing records at all?  I think the best way to have released Kid A would've been under a different name, so all the expectations that normally come along with a Radiohead album wouldn't have applied.  Before this album i don't think anyone really went out and bought Radiohead because they liked free form jazz.  <br />Overall, it's a nice piece for an art installation, and interesting background sounds for private time with your lover, but after I combined the 5 tracks i liked from this with the 5 tracks I liked from Amnesiac, I really have no reason to pull this off the shelf.
B00005AQE8|5.0|As I'm sure is the case with many hardcore hip-hop fans, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. Some might say that this album is played out but I don't think it can ever be played out. Once you get tired of listening to the first cd a million times, you've got a second cd of almost equally good songs waiting to be played a million times. I mean for about the first and only time, an artist came out with 2 cd's full of quality music. No matter what kind of mood your in - hardcore ready to smoke somebody, hardcore chillin ready to smoke some herb - it doesn't matter. This album's got chillin beats laced by hard core as well as sometimes thought provoking 2pac lyrics. Many people think that just because 2pac is generally seen as just hardcore gangsta rap that that's all he is. But throughout this album there are multiple instances of intellectual lyrics which adds a nice ring on top of the excellent beats and 2pacs flow. Overall this is a must have for any true hip-hop fan regardless of whether or not you're a 2pac fan.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I love Diana Krall. I have all her CD's and have spent many hours with the lights low, listening to that wonderful voice and her great piano, enjoying the intimate feeling her previous efforts have achieved. So I was really anticipating the release of this album, which has more of the types of songs I've particularly enjoyed by her in the past.<br />Having said that, it's very difficult for me to say that I really didn't enjoy this music and it all gets down to one thing- the strings accompanying her on these songs take my favorite jazz vocalist and turn her into &quot;easy listening.&quot; The string arrangments seem to dominate the music. Her wonderful piano has been pushed to the background and the way it's slotted in almost as an afterthought, seems to be there only to support the strings, rather than her vocals. Even though the songs are mostly slow tempo love songs, they fail to connect to the listener in the same intimate way her small ensemble did.<br />It seems all performers eventually feel the need to record with strings, perhaps feeling it bestows some sort of legitimacy to the music. But in this case I think it has the opposite effect and actually detracts from what's so good about other Diana Krall recordings. Ironically, it's that essence and connection that makes her other music so enjoyable that seems to be missing from this CD of love songs and ballads that need it the most. I tried imagining these songs if they were re-mixed without the strings, and think they would be equal to anything she's done. So while I recognize how important it is for musicians to experiment and evolve, this experiment failed to satisfy in my opinion.<br />That said, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and if your tastes run less toward jazz vocals and you don't mind the ever-present lush strings, you might like this disc just fine. It is high quality in every way and DK has never looked or sounded better. This disc just seems more suited to being played in thebackground, unlike her other music which was very involving, like it was being performed just for you.<br />So now I hate myself for giving my favorite lady a less than glowing review, but if you're familiar with her other music, you can decide for yourself if this disc will be for you or not. It might be worth buying just for the great cover art and those incredible shoes!  :-)
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is a great CD i have not heard i cd this good since i bought saliva every six seconds.  With songs like \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Hangnail\\" and then there big hit \\"How youremind me\\" and the song \\"Good Times Gone\\" probaly my favorite song.  This CD is awesom i recomend it highly.  If you like rock music at all you should love this!!
0800139151|4.0|The Quick and the Dead has never gotten the credit it deserves. Sam Raimi leads a fabulous cast inlcuding Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Huh? Yup, that's the cast. (Crowe and DiCaprio were insisted upon by Stone, who also produced. Smart lady.) And there's more fabulous stars in cameo roles. <br />Sure, Raimi's version of the Spaghetti Western is a little comic-bookey, but come on, Sharon Stone as the Woman With No Name: genius. She can squint with Clint any day. (Here lies the roots of Xena Warrior Princess, another Raimi creation.)<br />The Quick and the Dead never pretends to be Unforgiven, but it is a dramatic homage to all the best westerns with some truly original camera work, including Raimi's famous &quot;bullet cam.&quot;<br />So if you wanna have some fun, and see some great actors playing cowboy, The Quick and the Dead is for you. Too-serious western traditionalists need not apply, but you'll be sorry.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is a fantastic film. Great characters and very funny humor as well as a series fantasy drama. <BR>Who could forget when the large husband fo the tavern woman ask Val Killmers character: &quot;Wanna breed?&quot; I almost fell out of my chair I was laughing so hard. My friends and I still imitate Frangeen and Rool the brownies so well played by Kevin Pollack and ....forgot his name, sorry!<BR>What is interesting to note is that there are 4 books about Willow. One is the original book by Lucas written before the film and adds some further insite into the events of the original film.<BR>The next 3 books were written by Chris Claremont(of Marvel Comics X-Men fame) with direction by Lucas in the late 90's to 2000. This series is decidedly darker than the original movie and is NOT, repeat, not for young children!! Actually I never felt the first film was for young kids either but it is much lighter than the trilogy.<BR>Check out all 4 books if you like. I enjoyed them all even though the trilogy was shockingingly different at times it is well written.

B000002UDB|5.0|Many critics have accused this recording of being below par, especially in light of the masterpiece that preceded it. But taken on it's own terms &quot;MMT&quot; is just as strong (this is after all, The Beatles!). The title track is a brisk, catchy tune that features some of Ringo's best drumming (downright funky if you ask me) and the horns, sound effects (the passing bus being the coolest)and more of Paul's melodious, deep bass playing make this another instant classic. The entire LP, comprised in the U.S. of 2EP's worth of material and singles from earlier in the year, is a perfect picture of the band's development up to 1967. This staggering growth is evident in both the lighter songs (McCartney's &quot;Your Mother Shoulder Know&quot; is an obvious toss-off, albeit a brilliant one) to heavier, more experimental outings (the churning, mad scientist sound of the classic &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot;). George, ever the growing mystic, even makes waiting up late for a friend to arrive sound otherwordly (the cello-led and trippy &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;). After this fantastic LP, the Fab Four would retreat to a more conventional sound, but thier brilliance never waned. &quot;MMT&quot; simply SOUNDS like 1967 and what a trip it is!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Excellent selection of memory songs done superbly by Diana Krall
B000021YQV|4.0|As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort, it took me a long time to get into this one. But I guess i'm like that with every new cd a band comes out with. Anyway. I think that on this cd Serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song, but I was disapointed that the drummer, did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band's self-titled debut. All in all i really enjoyed this cd and I would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into System of a down. The single &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon. Although the sound of the song is a bit more radio-friendly than the rest of the cd, it is still a great song. Another song with great talent is the song &quot;Toxicity&quot; which has proven to become my favorite on this multi-faceted album.

B00005N9CV|5.0|When you first listen to Diana Krall's new album you may be disappointed. She does not swing hard like on &quot;Hit That Jive, Jack&quot; and &quot;East of The Sun&quot; or offer cute, novelty songs like &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot; and &quot;Peel Me A Grape.&quot; On The Look of Love Diana Krall gives her most subtle and lush offering yet. With unobtrusive strings playing on all tracks and a quartet used very sparsely yet effectively Diana Krall does just what the album's title says, she looks at love. She explores the thrill of falling in love (The Look of Love), the thrill of being in love (S'Wonderful), the heartbreak of losing love (I Get Along Without You Very Well), the vengeance of losing love (Cry Me A River), and everything in between. Diana Krall does all of this  while still using the Great American Songbook as her guide. One thing Diana Krall does maintain in this album, as with previous releases, is her ability to breathe new life into well-worn standards making them as applicable today as they were 50 years ago. The Look of Love is a brilliantly mellow gem that after careful inspection keeps the listener coming back for more and ensures Diana Krall's place as one of the best jazz interpreters we have.
1587990717|5.0|Every person who is interested in investing should read this book!<br />In investing, few can tell the difference between being lucky and smart.  Being successful in the short term can come from either source.  If it is coming from unrecognized sources of luck, however, the behavior that the investor associates with success can sink the ship.  The cautionary tale of Long Term Capital Management is cited in the book as an example of this point.  If youre so rich, why arent you smart? is the wonderful reversal here on the old saw.<br />I see this effect all the time in my consulting practice with helping companies understand how their decisions affect their stock price.  A large percentage of people feel that they know all the answers when their stock price is rising.  They keep doing the same things when the stocks are falling.  Few survive to still have top jobs when the cycle shifts again.  Then a new group of self-confident people take over who often dont know any more than those who preceded them.  Its just that their track records look better.<br />Fooled by Randomness will help make you more knowledgeably humble about what you can expect to accomplish with investments.  Not only do fewer than one percent outperform the market averages over long time periods, the ones who do are probably often being aided by luck as well.  Get thee to the index funds as soon as possible is the message that most should take away from this book.  Better yet, buy them when multiples are low!<br />The books fundamental point is that there is tremendous volatility in any investment.  Ignore that volatility to your peril.<br />At the same time, you should be cautious about how well you understand the volatility.  Stocks at their lows can still go to zero.  There are all kinds of events that can happen, that have not done so yet.  When they do, throw out all the old rules of investing.  The terrorist attacks on the United States last week are probably an example of this.  So each investment must be made as though you could be totally wrong.  This means that you have to manage your risk exposure to events you dont even know how to expect.<br />I loved his example of the joint probabilities of having a rare disease if you get a positive result on a test for that disease. Even most doctors apparently dont know how to evaluate that one.  If even well educated people cannot quantify two known risks occurring simultaneously in their own field, how can investors be expected to make good decisions?<br />Dr. Taleb has some very good advice for how to handle the psychology of being able to do this. He upholds the Stoic ideal -- the attempt by man to get even with probability which encourages wisdom, upright dealing, and courage.  This means not chasing the latest investment fad or fashion, not looking at your investments very often, and being open to both sides of any idea (it could go wrong as well as right --what are the consequences of both?).  I especially liked his idea of watching CNBC with the sound off so that the experts seem humorous and you are less likely to hear and follow their advice.  Even more poignant was his advice not to live on Park Avenue where living with all of the arrogant, temporarily lucky can make you feel small.  Instead, live somewhere that the results of your cautious approach will cause you to be the envy of all.<br />Dr. Taleb impressed me with his willingness to tell stories on himself about how quickly he can become superstitious when things are going well, take on excess risks, and start looking too short term.  After all, we are only human!<br />The importance of this book can only be appreciated if you go back and think about your biggest investing successes.  How much was luck versus skill?  A good way to test is to see if the same approach has continued to work for you whenever you use it.  Another good test is to see how often it would have backfired in the past.<br/>In my research on good decision making, I find that those who guard the downside first make the most money in the long run.

0767809270|5.0|Being the brother of an AIDS casualty, it is always painful to watch this movie, especially the final 30 minutes.  Tom Hanks really came into his own with this movie and Forrest Gump.  Denzil Washington proved himself early on in A Soldier's Story.  The casting in this touching movie couldn't have been better.  Antonio Banderas does a top-notch job as Hank's strong and long-suffering partner.  The late Jason Robbards does his usual fantastic job as Hanks boss.  This movie holds a special place in my heart, along with Gods and Monsters, in trying to show the world that difference doesn't mean defferance...
B00003CX5P|5.0|I loved this movie, and I am so happy that Lucas is putting it out on DVD. I haven't seen the DVD yet, but the extras look stunning and I can't wait to get it.
0375703764|1.0|I read some of the book reviews on House of Leaves and was interested whether or not the book was good. The reviews were very polarized so I took my chances. This book is nothing more than random stories thrown together with font changes and pages with upside-down words on them for effect. Do not waste your money on this book
B00005NP04|5.0|Yes, finally for all of us Martina McBride fans we have a greatest hits collection to cherish!  Truly country's top female vocalist, she provides all the &quot;goodies&quot; and some new future hits  on her first greatest hits collection.  Just as Kenny Chesney's greatest hits has been so popular, I expect this one will be too with both country and pop fans.  Essentials like Independence Day, Valentine, I Love You, A Broken Wing, Whatever You Say, Love's The Only House, My Baby Loves Me---etc...---they are all here, trust me.  Even one that Martina says should have been a hit called Strangers had it been released correctly by her management at the time as a follow-up to Independence Day is here.  Three new cuts (Blessed, Where Would You Be and future hit Concrete Angel) are a part of this 19 track explosive set!  Hard to believe that country's top female vocalist for the past several years has only one CMA vocalist award to show for it, isn't it!  Her beauty, vocals and emotion she places in her songs are unmatched in country music today.  This one is a must have.
B00003CXXI|5.0|People don't like Shrek?  Look at my right eye twitchin'!  <br />Do you like THE PRINCESS BRIDE?  M.P.&amp; THE HOLY GRAIL?  Does the mere mention of a line from one of those two films make you giggle?  Laugh hysterically?  Do you value that?  Me too.<br />Get ready for another one of those quotable fairy tale movies that will have you drying your eyes, running to the bathroom, and &quot;Mak'n'waffles!&quot;  Eddie Murphy adds a beautiful foil character to the film, allowing us to grow to love a green, snail-eating farter like the Big S.  He (Murphy) does not save the film, as he does MULAN, because the film is bigger than he is.  He fits.   And fits well.  And Cameron Diaz as the Princess?  Priceless!  I've gotta go preorder!

B00005B3Z6|5.0|Every now and then, all of the elements in a production come together -- direction, acting, writing -- to create something that is absolutely PERFECT.  The British QAF is the best television I've ever seen, hands down. There really is no comparison to the American version, which is more of a soap opera than a drama.<br />The characters are incredibly 3-dimensional and likeable -- even Stuart -- because you can identify with all of them.  I loaned my DVDs to a straight guy-friend, and he actually watched the whole thing twice through -- he got just as addicted to it as I did!<br />Don't be put off by the price; this is something you'll watch over and over again.  If there's nothing on TV, I find myself popping in an episode of QAF and enjoying it again and again.

B00005NP04|5.0|I've spent the whole summer waiting for the Martina McBride &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD.  And believe me...it's been well-worth the wait.  I haven't always been a Martina fan, but ever since I bought her platinum release &quot;Emotion&quot; last year, I've become a HUGE follower.  Her voice is so powerful, and she picks such excellent songs on her CD.s<br />This CD features some of the best country music I've heard in a long time.  Not only does it feature her hits, such as the powerful &quot;Wild Angels&quot;, the up-tempo &quot;Happy Girl&quot;, &amp; her career song &quot;Independence Day&quot;, it also features four new songs - all with hit potential.  &quot;When God Fearin' Women Get the Blues&quot; has already made its mark on radio &amp; TV all over the nation (including on CMT's MwL), and is bound to go higher.  A stand-out new track is &quot;Concrete Angel&quot;, reminiscent of &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;This Uncivil War&quot; (from her album &quot;Emotion).<br />This CD is a must have for all Martina fans - and anyone who likes country music.  Martina truly has made her mark as the voice for female country stars in the new millenium.

0062502182|5.0|In our age of materialism, it brings into view the importance of what is really important in our lives and the lives of those we love.  Brings a new perspective in today's world of terrorism. A very simple and humbling book. One of the best books I have ever read.
B00005LK94|5.0|I just love this movie. It is a simple story yet it was done so well, that I'd call this a beautiful movie. Anna Paquin gives a superb performance (think the Piano, not X-Men), and so does Jeff Daniels.  Jeff Daniels??? I mean, when I hear Jeff Daniels, I think &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.  But actually, he gives a very credible performance in this movie as the estranged father. And the cinematography, you just have to see it. Absolutely beautiful. When you get to the last 30 miles of Amy's (Anna's character) last flight, stop munching popcorn for a moment, turn up the volume so that Mary Carpenter's song fills the room, then enjoy this wonderful sequence. You'd have goosebumps (if not tears) watching this young girl flying with the geese, while an emotion-evoking song is sung in the background. It's like magic. It's like, you would just want to get out and buy an ultralight and head for skies. and fly with the geese and birds of all kinds. and live there for the rest of your life. Well, maybe not for the rest of your life, but ... you get the idea. Well back to the movie... I believe this movie will go down as one of the all-time family favorites. Watch this with your kids, and it may get them interested in, and have respect for nature and wildlife (as oppose to living a wild life). Also I'm pretty certain, after watching this movie, a lot of viewers will find themselves high in up in the skies, dreaming of flight...<br />... and oh yeah, get the special edition. It has the widescreen version (to enjoy the full benefits of the cinematography). Plus you get a special feature about the true experiments that were the inspiration for this movie.
B00005N9CV|5.0|What can we say about Diana Krall that hasn't been said?  She's beautiful and talented and has a way with a song.  &quot;The Look of Love&quot; only further adds to the opinion that she is one of the more accomplished artists of our time.  Her new CD shows her growth as an artist by venturing where she has not gone before.<br />Rather than stick with studio musicians, Diana enlists the help of the London Symphony Orchestra.  Her voice blends pertectly with the muscianship and gives this CD a classical feel.  Diana shows her ability to handle all kinds of music, from the Latin-tinged &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; (remember when the Beatles did this one?), to the more traditonal &quot;S'Wonderful.&quot;.  Other symphony-influenced pieces are are &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;.<br />Diana has always been a big fan of the great composers and she offers us the work of a wide variety.   Bachrach and David's title track, Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;I Get Along Very Well Without You&quot;, Johnny Mercer's &quot;I Remember You&quot; are all standouts.<br />Diana's voice has also remarkably improved (not that it wes bad before!.)  It's much softer and smoother, which fits in beautifully with the tone of this CD.<br />&quot;The Look of Love&quot; is a must buy for Krallaniacs everywhere.  But now that you discovered Diana Krall, check out some other great artists like Jane Monheit, Tierney Sutton, the late great Susannah McCorkle and of course, the one, the only, the incomparable Jacqui Naylor.
B00000INEX|3.0|This is the first video in the series, that my daughter, then 10 months old recieved. She loved it from the beginning, and will still watch it 4 months later. Since then we have purchased more of these videos (Mozart, Shakepeare, Van Gogh and the 2 Baby Dolittles) and she has varied responses to them. Baby Bach uses toys, real children and other objects while playing &quot;baby friendly&quot; music. This formula works, my daughter is entertained by most of this video, especially the chicken and the robot segment, and with the exception of the lava lamp segment which will initially capture her attention but soon lose it. The video segments work around the introduction of the ascending scale sounded out throughout with still images of instuments. I have no problem with Julie Aigner-Clark using her own children in this video, but I think that may be on of the reasons this video comes across as so amateurish. Perhaps the use of live action children could have smoothed out the transitions between video clips and still images but instead, the overall feel is somewhat choppy. The use of Bach's music is good, but there really isn't much of it overall in this video because of all the sound effects that score the toy segments. Overall, I would have to say that baby Mozart was a better effort than Baby Bach. As with that video, I think the age range (1-36 months) is too broad.  There are loud noises that can readily frighten young babies while the extremely repetitive and static nature of much of this video may bore older toddlers.  There is no excuse, however, for the last bit of this video which is a selection of out-takes.  Of what purpose, educational or entertainment are blooper clips of her daughters?  You get to see the younger one flaying around on the floor, taking off sun glasses, and the older one mouthing &quot;Mommy please stop laughing&quot; and mugging for the camera.  I'm sure, as their mother,  she found this very cute. As a viewer, I found it extremely self-indulgent.  Because of this, I turn the TV off so neither I or my daughter need be subject to the the antics of little Sierra and Aspen. If you want a change of pace from Baby Mozart, this video will do, but if you want to buy either one or the other, I would recommend Mozart.-indulgent.  Because of this, I turn the TV off so neither I or my daughter need be subject to the the antics of little Sierra and Aspen. If you want a change of pace from Baby Mozart, this video will do, but if you want to buy either one or the other, I would recommend Mozart.
B00005KHJM|3.0|It's a great movie, beloved among many of us modern non-jesus-worshipping types. So unless you're buying it blind, you probably know what you're getting.  Beware though, this edition left a little out.  An expository scene at the start of the movie, one which explains that the Inspector is a 30-something virgin (*eeew*) seems to be missing, which caused a bit of confusion among folks that had never seen it.  You may want to spring for the deluxe edition, which may contain said scene.
0345350499|4.0|The Mists of Avalon presents an interesting take on the Arthurian Legend--the women's points of view. Bradley does an excellent job of drawing her female characters as rich human beings as enmeshed in the intrigue and chaos of early Britain as are the men who are at war. Perhaps more so, because they bear and raise the next generation of warriors and mothers while being left to themselves in isolated castles.<br />  I did, however,find the character of Gwynhyfar the least three dimensional, she starts out as an agoraphobic Christian, but somewhere that agoraphobia dissipates and Christianity turns to zealot. Unfortunately, we don't really see that transition.<br />  Bradley also did an excellent job of bringing real historical figures, namely St. Patrick who has finished converting the Irish and is hell bent on converting the British heathen.<br />  Her characters are rich and whole. They certainly have their flaws and failings. Sometimes the novel tended to be slow or jumpy, but at 900 or so pages, I couldn't really fault those few less than stellar moments.<br />  One of the main themes-Christianity vs. Paganism- was enlightening. I had never before thought of the Arthur legend as taking place at a time when Christianity wasn't firmly established throughout the land. I don't know how authentic Bradley's portrayals of pagan ritual really are, but they seemed real to me.<br />BTW-- the book is soooo much better than the miniseries!
B00005KFUN|5.0|When I heard this band's previous album SHOWBIZ I thought it was very impressive and I told everybody I knew to watch for these kids. I ordered ORIGIN OF SYMMETRY from Amazon's sister UK site because I really couldn't wait for it's American release. <br />Boy was I glad I did that! <br />Ladies and gentlemen may I present you with the best rock album of the year. Period. These guys, perhaps unfairly, fell into the &quot;Next Radiohead&quot; category with Travis and Coldplay. What this band is doing I think is a lot more ambitious than Radiohead. Take the angst of Nirvana, the anger of RATM, the gradiose of Queen, the quirkiness of The Pixies and the experimentation of Radiohead and then you'll get an idea of what ORIGIN OF SYMMETRY is like. This is equal parts punk, grunge, metal, classical and then out of nowhere comes some jazz and even a touch of flamenco if I'm not mistaken. But it's 100% fun. The fact that these guys are making such great music at such a young age really bodes well for rock-n-roll. It's going to take bands like Muse, At the Drive-In, Idlewild, and And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead to save rock.
B00005PJ8I|5.0|Never has a two hour movie seemed so short!  When it ended I wanted more.  What happens next?  What was in that package?!!!!<br />To sum the plot up briefly, this is the story of a time obsessed man whose plane goes down.  He is stranded on an island alone.  He suddenly has nothing but time.  Hanks's character is likeable and, we soon find out, very resourceful.  Excellent story of survival.  Tom Hanks turns in another great performance.
0385501560|2.0|I feel like Chuck's been holding back a bit. It's like he's not sure which direction he wants to go. Like he's straddling the notions of serving the mainstream or pushing the envelope and going more toward the other extreme. Fight Club is hard to follow-up, but seems like there's a bit of a rut here. Very odd. Anyone reading his books out of order might suggest that this was one of his first efforts, and Fight Club his latest. The repetition gimmick gets a bit old, really.<br />That said, I'd still say it's a safe bet that I'll buy and read any other books Chuck has to write.
0440219078|5.0|This book was a portrait made of words depicting a society controlled totally by humans.  This community had everything one could want or need and gave purpose to all the lives existing there.  There were no human needs unmet.  Or were there?  How can we exist in a world without love?  This book is a wonderful tool to show children why it is so important that humans are individuals.  It is important to have our own opinions and to create a balance among our ideas.  The ideal world champions diversity, not sameness.
B00000ING2|1.0|The Coen brothers are great, but this is a lousy movie, there are some original parts, but a lot of the humor doesn't work.  Jennifer Jason Leigh uses the most grating voice imaginable.
B00005N9CV|4.0|While the voice is still steamy, the musicality still swings -- the total package is a little disappointing considering what Diana Krall has given us in the past. Maybe it is the &quot;lush&quot; string arrangements -- but, are we listening to a jazz singer going &quot;pop&quot; on us? Too bad. I am not a purist, but still it seems like she has made too many tour dates with Tony Bennett.It is worth the price of admission --but Love Scenes and All for You remain the best from Diana.
0671578855|3.0|This book is yet another fun read by Bujold but her rampant misandrony is becoming the dominant theme of her work.  Males, particularly white, heterosexual, ones without massive physical or mental/emotional damage, are over and over again portrayed as complete idiots that need to be rescued or straightened out by strong women.  While I gladly ignored her complete lack of knowledge about matters military (which she admits) in the first books, because they were rather well written and side-splittingly funny, her hatred/contempt for males is getting too much to ignore.  Her only really smart/competent characters are women and especially women who make better men than men do!<br />If my information is correct, Ms. Bujold went through a particularly nasty divorce and this would explain the misandry.  May I suggest some therapy so we get more scenes such as Miles' dinner party and less of the bile?
B00005N9CV|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I love this album. I've played it and played it and played it. But it veers toward -- if there's such as word -- overlushness and I miss the jazz group sound that I think marked her earlier albums. Krall's voice is always a joy, no matter where she places it, and this album is no exception. &quot;I Remember You&quot; is a particular favorite, but close behind are &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Love Letters.&quot; <br />I don't know who chose the songs for the album, but I thought &quot;The Look of Love&quot; really was out of place. Too '70s? I don't know. She does a fine job, but it just doesn't seem to fit with the other songs.<br />Some of the albums seem to have two added tracks not listed on the album notes: a Christmas song and another. Both return to the sound we heard from Krall in her earlier CDs, a little rougher but still fine jazz.
0884271153|4.0|This book describes Goldratt's method of solving problems, resolving conflicts, and how to apply his methods to sales, marketing (there is a difference), and general business management.<br />As a novel, it doesn't really hold my attention. But the ideas do. Presenting them as a book is a, ahem, novel way of doing it. It holds my attention better than reading a how-to book.<br />The process is hinted at, but not completely described. This is different than &quot;The Goal,&quot; which came right out and told you what to do. I think that Goldratt was trying to promote his consulting company as much as sell a book.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Many people have jaws in their top five. I have never liked this film though it is in my legendary 5 year golden age of horror filmmaking.  <BR> I will be the first to admit that Jaws is well shot, well acted, and well written.  But it is something even deeper that espouses fear during the viewing of this film.<BR>  There isn't a reader out there who hasn't been out swimming smomewhere in the world and felt that nauseating fear: what the hell is down there, beneath me, swimming around ?  <BR>   THAT is the beauty of JAWS.  It feeds off that universal 'Jonah and the whale' fear that all human beings have experienced at one time of another.  Except now the whale is a giantic great white shark with rows of razor sharp teeth.<BR>   As to why this film is so low on my list ? I simply do not enjoy watching it, though I appreciate what a well made film it is.
6305364648|5.0|This was a good movie from Arnold. You add in Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold who had good performances,you wind up with a good viewing for all. There was an excellent plot. The story line was also great. Add in good acting as well. The action in this movie<BR>were top notch as well. Arnold managed to do battle with all of the forces of evil in this film. Jamie Lee Curtis played his wife who also gets involved in the action and spy mayhem. The scenery and special effects were outstanding as well. All in all<BR>a great movie to see. Buy this movie and watch it. You will not be dissapointed.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok, John Mayer owes me dinner or at the very least a thank you on his next cd:)) I have bought this cd three times, in three different versions!  The first an indie cd in Atlanta, then the more polished version on Aware, and now the major label debut.  If you like Ben Folds, Dave Matthews, Barenaked Ladies to name but a few, then you will love John Mayer.  This guy (kid really) has got talent just pouring from him.  He plays a great guitar, great voice and writes witty lyrics with hooks that stick in your head.  The over all groove is kinda jazzy-pop.  My fave tracks are &quot;Back To You&quot; an amazing mid-tempo love song worth getting the cd for alone, &quot;Neon&quot; is so catchy I sing it long after the cd ends, &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; a really sexy ode, &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; great, clever lyrical tale.  It's just an awesome cd, best find of 2001.  I've been listening to it non-stop lately it just boosts my mood.  Buy, buy, buy.
B0000029DD|5.0|As background music for a video montage of scenes from the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Jeff Buckley's cover of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot; brought me to tears.  Although it has only been a week, no other song composed for or associated with the tragedy fits the haunting images we as Americans have witnessed.  I searched as if my life was dependant on learning the artist and title of the song.  I immeadiately purchased a copy of &quot;Grace&quot; once I learned it contained the recording.  Though I purchased the album for a single song, that may eventually end up on a compilation CD to raise money for the victims, I can not believe I have lived without the music of Jeff Buckley in my life.  He puts all of the &quot;talented&quot; artists with &quot;fabulous&quot; voices in my CD collection to shame.  How did I miss this album in 1994?  He can sing.  He can play.  And, he can move you to places you didn't know you could go.  &quot;Halleluijah&quot; is not even my favorite song on the CD.  Buy it now and you will understand.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Dylan is faced with a paradox. At once attempting to stay relevant and at the same time being enshrined in the dusty museums of public memory. Though he was justly awarded three Grammys for his death- and depression-drenched 1997 album, &quot;Time Out of Mind,&quot; one suspects he was recognized as much for his long career and for surviving a health scare than for the work itself.<br />Which is why it has come as a pleasant surprise to nearly everyone that Dylan's self-produced follow-up album, &quot;Love and Theft,&quot; is not a disappointment, but in some ways an improvement over the ethereal &quot;Time.&quot; Looking youthful on the album's black and white cover (and still wearing that Vincent Price mustache), Dylan and his touring band deliver several songs that will immediately enter his canon, a few bluesy rockers that will make great concert fodder, and even a few experiments in swing, jazz, and vocal pop.<br />Apparently freed by the recent accolades from the crushing burden of his past greatness, Dylan exhibits the kind of casual confidence we'd expect from a man half his age. The perennial joker even pokes fun at himself, as in &quot;Summer Days,&quot; where he sings, &quot;I'm drivin' in the flats in a Cadillac car / The girls all say 'You're a worn out star.'&quot; Again, in &quot;High Water,&quot; Dylan is told, &quot;'As great as you are, man, you'll never be greater than yourself ' / I told her I didn't really care.'&quot;<br />&quot;Love and Theft,&quot; Dylan's 45th album, starts out with the chugalug rhythmic beat of &quot;Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,&quot; a Dylanesque allegory akin to something off 1968's &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; -- that is, it's inscrutable. Next is &quot;Mississippi,&quot; a song Dylan attempted to record for &quot;Time&quot; but eventually chose to give to Sheryl Crow for her 1998 album, &quot;The Globe Sessions.&quot; Crow sped up the song and rendered it a likable pop ditty, as is her wont. But in Dylan's hands thesong is fully revealed for the master work that it is - a travelogue of pain, heartbreak, regret and endurance.<br />&quot;Well, my ship's been split to splinters,&quot; Dylan sings, &quot;and it's sinking fast / I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past / But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free / I've got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.&quot;<br />Of course, Dylan's voice is the key. David Bowie once described Dylan as having &quot;a voice like sand and glue.&quot; That was 30 years ago. Now it's more like sand and glue dumped into a cement mixer. But in a world of J. Lo and 'N Sync, Dylan's voice is a bedrock, the cornerstone of a sinking civilization.<br />In &quot;Summer Days&quot; Dylan and his band deliver one of his most riotous, freewheelin' songs since, well, 1963's &quot;Freewheelin'.&quot; It's a swingin' song (literally!) that will have you tapping your toes as Dylan is confronted by a woman who says, &quot;You can't repeat the past,&quot; and he replies, &quot;You can't? What do you mean you can't? Of course you can!&quot;<br />On &quot;High Water&quot; Dylan is at his apocalyptic best. Adapting the song and title from Charley Patton's classic country blues chronicling a disastrous flood, Dylan uses the flood as a metaphor for larger concerns. With a bluegrassy sound, furious banjo work, and a rising flourish, &quot;High Water&quot; sounds like the end of the world:<br />&quot;Water pourin' into Vicksburg,&quot; Dylan sings, &quot;Don't know what I'm gonna do / 'Don't reach out for me,' she said, 'Can't you see I'm drowning too?' / It's rough out there / High water everywhere.&quot;<br />&quot;Honest With Me&quot; is a gritty blues rocker which finds Dylan &quot;stranded in the city that never sleeps&quot; where &quot;some of these women, they just give me the creeps!&quot; There's a wicked slide guitar here that will remind you of Dylan's peak mid-'60s work with guitar gods like Michael Bloomfield andRobbie Robertson. Dylan is all bile here, and delightfully so.<br />&quot;Sugar Baby&quot; is the languorous, dreamy blues that closes the album. This is the song which sounds the most like &quot;Time Out of Mind,&quot; a dispatch from another world where &quot;every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick&quot; and &quot;happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.&quot;<br />&quot;Floater,&quot; &quot;Bye and Bye,&quot; &quot;Po' Boy,&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot; are all in a jazzy-vocal pop vein that won't put Tony Bennett out of work, but will surprise you and make you wonder if there's anything Bob Dylan won't try -- including some rather corny jokes that are ingratiating rather than off putting. &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; is good, but I'm still not used to &quot;Cry a While's&quot; herky-jerky blues tempo. Also, the album's sequencing is sometimes jarring and leaves something to be desired.<br />This isn't the best album Bob Dylan ever recorded and it's not the place to start your Dylan collection, but it is a highly successful departure from &quot;Time's&quot; sound. And, as he sings in &quot;Floater,&quot; Dylan is proving at 60 that &quot;Old, young¾age don't carry weight / It doesn't matter in the end.&quot;
B000002JOH|5.0|I don't consider myself to like heavy metal but I have to say that Pantara have power in the songs they right, you will feel this music the drums pound right through you. The guitar has strenth on its own. On top of all that you have Phil by the end of this album you will understand.
B00003CXXI|5.0|When I first went to see Shrek at the movie theater, I was expecting the same stale and unentertaining fairy tales that Disney seems to pump out constantly.  But when I left that theater, my sides were aching from laughter.  Not only did the film teach a cute little value that gave me that good feeling, there was humor for children, teenagers, and adults all the same.  The storyline was engaging and entertaining, the soundtrack is playing in my house as we speak, and Shrek is definetly a character I won't soon forget.  SHREK ROCKS!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Well, Bobby just gets better and better. This album displays his awesome grasp of American music in all its powerful forms - from the raucous Highway 61ish &quot;Honest With Me&quot; to bluegrass and country and ragtime, and even old-timey melodies that seem to seep up from the dusty stages of the vaudeville circuit. The music reminds me most of The Basement Tapes in terms of Bob's feeling for simple songs sung beautifully and, especially, in terms of the obvious joy the man exudes - this is Bob sounding like he's having the most fun he's had in years! <br />Part of the fun comes from the excellent musicians he's working with; Bob knows his &quot;Never-Ending Tour&quot; band so well they're like another instrument for him, and these guys lay down licks to match the exquisite vocals as if they're having the time of their lives as well. There is much humor, much wistful sadness, and abundant joy throughout. I can't wait to hear some of this stuff live in a few weeks when Bob comes to San Francisco. <br />As a last thought, I'd just like to say that there is such a redemptive or restorative aspect to this album, that listening to it brings a brief respite from the horrors we've all been faced with over these past days. Bob has always had a prescient way of taking folks out of themselves and into the larger world that lives between the lines of his songs. This album is a boon to the spirit, a balm to the heart, and a wonderful gift from Bob.
B00005JG6R|4.0|I have to admit that this movie was pretty good. I liked the part where Tetsuo and the kids and people like that would use their psychic powers. those were my favorite parts. I do have to say that this is an animation that is definitely 100% not for kids. There are scenes where it is just plain bloody (but they do animate pretty good) and at the end when Tetsuo turns into a monster, I thought that was the grossest thing I ever saw in animation. When people get shot, like in the beginning, they make so much blood, but like I said, they animate it pretty good. Earlier, when Tetsuo's gang are riding their bikes, I have to say that was drawn very good. Even though it is very gross in the parts where Tetsuo was monster (I mean really gross; young kids SHOULD NOT WATCH), the way all the cartoons were drawn, it looked so smooth and flowed very well. The movements of the characters looked natural like a real person (which is hard to do for a cartoon) and I have to say this is definitely one of the most beautiful drawn and animated cartoons I have ever watched. I actually don't want to give it a 4-star rating. I think of it more like a 4.5-star rating but you cannot do that. Overall, watch this unless you cannot take very gross scenes. Pretty good though.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Let me begin by saying I'm a huge Diana Krall fan. I saw her performance in Santa Clara two months ago, which has gone down in my book as one of the top evenings of my life. She is an amazing musician. What concerns me are the decisions being made in the studio. These are my observations:<BR>The Look Of Love-Karaoke. On most tracks it sounds as though she sang over a series of generic instrumentals. There exists little or no connection (counterpoint) between the music and her vocals. An unnatural amount of reverb in used on her voice. On several tracks, one must strain to hear what she is singing. Her fantastic piano playing is distant - almost hesitant. Selection of songs - questionable.<BR>Why wouldn't an artist of this stature stick with the formula of her previous album? It worked so well. This is not a ground breaking, over the top, edgy effort. These are jazz standards. Stick with what works. Don't toy with the delicate nature of the craft.<BR>I don't know why I get so wrapped up in these issues with Diana Krall, but i do.

0679882820|5.0|this is a wonderful book introducing various sounds--animals, items in and around the house ... even thunder--and that's been a wonderful thing.  My son has never been afraid of the loud cracks and rumbles of a thunderstorm b/c I've been able to say &quot;that's thunder (or lightning), just like Mr. Brown makes&quot; and then we procede to make the sounds (boom, boom, boom or splatt, splatt, splatt).  This is one of the books that I always give as a gift at baby showers b/c the very young can enjoy it--simple, happy and fun!!  **My son is now 2 1/2 and still pulls this book off the shelf for me to read to him ... or for him to read to me!

0451167716|5.0|I never read another book like this.<br />Basically, it's the only book I read multiple times (4 or 5 I guess) enjoying it every time again and never getting tired of. The last time I read it was on a plane to Italy and I can only tell you: if you ever want to travel to Sicily, read this book first. It will change your experience completely, actually seeing all the places you just read about. Imagine you see the characters from the book walking around, acting, talking...I just can't forget it.<br />A word about the movie: Without doubt, Coppola did a great job. But I would strongly recommend to read the book BEFORE watching the movie. However, I also know many people who read it just AFTER seeing the movie. And they enjoyed it, too, but after reading they wanted to see the movie again, because they thought having missed something when they saw it the first time. So take my advice - read first!
078322608X|5.0|Okay, who in here DOES NOT think that Bruce N' Brad give their best performances (besides the Sixth Sense &amp; Fight Club) in 12 Monkeys?!?!  If you are the type of person who enjoys light-hearted, easy-to-comprehend films----Don't Watch This Movie!!  Not only is it difficult to understand at times, but it's just flat-out weird!!  I think that's why I enjoy it so much though.  I admit, the first time you view it, you will be COMPLETELY and UTTERLY lost.  I know I was.  It's difficult to really compose a plot summary.  It would be difficult to follow.  But if you like movies with plot twists and dark subject matters, this film would be perfect for you.  Madeleine Stowe also turns in a note-worthy performance.  Highly recommended!!
0060934913|5.0|For anyone interested in the food business, who enjoys a fast-paced writing style, and has an open mind and a sense of humor, this is a great book.  A review I read compared his writing style to Hunter S. Thompson, which I would agree with completely.  Its an opportunity to hear the informal autobiography of an accomplished, wacky, and honest chef.  I am not employed in the food business, but I am interested by it, and I found this easy to read, entertaining, and generally informative.
B000050FEN|5.0|This has got to be one of the best thrillers ever!!  Fincher is an awesome director, and with Se7en, he made me like Brad Pitt even more.  It's movies like this one, that proves Pitt is definitely not just another pretty face!!  Morgan Freeman is great, as are Gwyneth and Kevin Spacey.  Spacey is one of my favorite actors because of his spine-tingling performance in this flick.  A creative plot, surprise ending, and top-notch acting makes &quot;Se7en a perfect ten&quot;.  This film may be extremely graphic, but hey, it's worth it.  A must-see!!
B00005AQEA|5.0|You two haven't even heard the cd. I can tell by what you wrote it had nothing to do with the cd.<br />But anyway it says that it is remastered? in which way? that's all i wanna know.
B000003CKH|5.0|This album expresses so many emotions and has so much feeling.  Everything blends together perfectly: the awesome guitar, rhythmic bass, even the moog, and especially the vocals.  This album is an essential.  Its great for long roadtrips because you can play it all the way through and then again.  I'd have to say it is the best Cake album and will become a classic and held in high esteem for all who own it.
B000002699|4.0|This session serves as a changing of the guard: from the swinging style of  be-bop to the more beat-oriented, electronically textured fusion to come. This is the first Miles Davis release where Wayne Shorter plays a soprano sax, and the change of tone fits this music perfectly. There's two electric keyboardists (Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock), augmented by Joe Zawinul on electric organ, giving this music a spacey, ethereal feel. Overall, this isn't one of Miles Davis' best, but interesting nonetheless.

B00005A1PR|4.0|India.Arie's debut album is a soft, delicate and beautiful release.  Bucking most r&amp;b trends, she eschews drum machines, and anything electronic.  Ms. Arie has noted that James Taylor is one of her influences and he felt throughout the album.  The songs have a personal nature about and they seem real.  &quot;Video&quot; is a great song as is &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot; and her tribute to Stevie Wonder &quot;Wonderful&quot; is heartfelt and earnest.  The album's standout track is &quot;Brown Skin&quot; which is a tremendous track.
B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot are incredible! They are the greatest band in the world... all that f-ing distortion, and three, yes, THREE percussionists... man... I can't begin to tell you how brutal these guys are! I mean, like, they keep saying the &quot;f&quot; word, and those lyrics, man, not at all whiney or always the same, so heavy...it really makes you FEEL the hate of these nine, ANGRY bstrds... yeah, they really have come such a long way since &quot;wait &amp; bleed&quot; , songs like &quot;Left Behind&quot; shows that Slapcock are trying something TOTALLY different... man...they have so much more to offer than harmonies and gimmicks...<BR>SO brutal... SO hardcore... NO F-ING SINGLES... well maybe just a couple...?
B00005N9CV|4.0|Diana Krall is one of the best jazz singers around today.  She has the tremendous ability to slip inside a song and wear it like a glove.  Her smoky voice can alternate between force and subtlety as in the beautiful &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;.  She has excellent arrangements and they add a lush sheen to standards like &quot;Love Letters&quot;, the title track and &quot;Besame Mucho&quot;.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|&quot;Love &amp; Theft&quot; is a deeply layered work that grows on you and gets more interesting with repeated listenings.  It starts with what strikes me as a rock rhumba where Dylan sings, &quot;I've had too much of your company said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.&quot;  It moves into a rather rote melody with Dylan's voice like a gravel road, &quot;Got nothin' for you; had nothin' before ... Only one thing I did wrong, stayed in Mississippi way too long.&quot;  &quot;Summer Days&quot; is a boppin' boogie woogie.  Lyrically, Dylan is at his best, &quot;My back's been to the wall so long, it seems like it's stuck.  Why don't you break my heart again for good luck?&quot;  I love the soft shoe shuffle of &quot;Bye &amp; Bye.&quot;  On &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; he offers the wry observation, &quot;You're gonna need my help sweetheart; you can't make love all by yourself.&quot;  (One could reference the song about the dog on Glen Phillips' brilliant Abulum CD.)  The strings on &quot;Floater (Too Much to Ask)&quot; are beautifully arranged on the song that touches upon conflict between old and young and how it &quot;doesn't make any difference.&quot;  Indeed, Dylan stretches beyond generations which may be the point of the varied musical styles on this CD.  On &quot;High Water&quot; Dylan sounds like he's doing a Tennessee Ernie Ford immitation of &quot;16 Tons&quot; that works well.  &quot;Moonlight&quot; is a wonderful little bit of relaxation with light breezy guitar strumming and a pastoral feel.  The slide guitar snarls and the drums and electric guitar are heavy in what has to be the most ironic lyric in light of this CD being released on the day of the World Trade Towers bombling as Dylan sings, &quot;Some things are too terrible to be true.&quot;  &quot;Po' Boy&quot; is a sweet little shuffle, &quot;Othello told Desdemona, 'Cover me with that blanket.  By the way, what happened to that poison wine?'  She said, 'I gave it you; you drank it.' Po' Boy!&quot;  My favorite track on the CD is &quot;Cry A While&quot; with its hot blues riff and Dylan's voice cracking, &quot;I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry a while.&quot;  The CD ends with a somewhat plodding melody with a thoughtful lyric that goes something like, &quot;As sure as you're living, as sure as you're born, look up and see what your Creator made for Gabriel blows his horn.&quot;  (If I don't have that exactly right, sorry Bob, but I LOVE it!)  This is a typical Dylan CD that makes you scratch your head at how it comes together so brilliantly.  At times the lyrics are better than the melodies; and the whole of the CD is more than each individual track.  The band, the singer and the production click.  If you've loved Dylan, you need to hear this incarnation of his amazing talent.favorite track on the CD is &quot;Cry A While&quot; with its hot blues riff and Dylan's voice cracking, &quot;I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry a while.&quot;  The CD ends with a somewhat plodding melody with a thoughtful lyric that goes something like, &quot;As sure as you're living, as sure as you're born, look up and see what your Creator made for Gabriel blows his horn.&quot;  (If I don't have that exactly right, sorry Bob, but I LOVE it!)

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob Dylan's last album Time Out Of Mind was a stunning return to prominence for the old master.  It was his first top ten album in almost twenty years and pulled down the album of year honors at the Grammies.  In the four years since that album, Mr. Dylan has added an Oscar to his collection and has played countless concerts throughout the world including playing for the Pope.  He now springs Love &amp; Theft on us and in a word it is one of the best albums he's ever released.  While there was a sense of foreboding on Time Out Of Mind, Love &amp; Theft is loose and fun.  You know when Mr. Dylan sings about booty calls, this isn't a serious affair. His touring band backs him on the album and the 500 plus concerts they have played together shows.  They are a tight, cohesive unit and they easily move from blues to rock to even swing with ease.  Larry Campbell is a brilliant and underrated guitarist and together with guitarist Charlie Sexton they form a powerful duo.  Mr. Dylan has never had a great voice, but in recent years, it has really fallen apart.  This turns out to be the best thing that has happened to him as his gravelly voice adds tremendous character to songs like the travelogue &quot;Mississippi&quot; (which was an outtake and a song Sheryl Crow released on her Globe Sessions album), the winsome &quot;Summer Days&quot; and the soft &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;.  &quot;Po' Boy&quot; is a tremendous song spiked with humorous lines.  Back in the 60's, Mr. Dylan was the voice of his generation, some forty years on his voice is still ringing.
B000059XYM|4.0|Scary Movie is a great comedy that will probably make you laugh contstantly throughout the whole movie. To enjoy the movie, you must like parodies and the gross sexual content that is geared to make you laugh. The Wayans brothers do an excellent job, and the Carmen Electra appearance was great. This movie is geared toward teenagers. The plot doesn't make much sense, but for anyone that just wants to laugh, you have to see this movie.

6302054982|5.0|The movie Goodfellas gives a great account of life in the mob.  This movie told from the character Henry played by Ray Liotta perspective gives you an insight on three decades of mob life.  The main plot of the movie is about an Irish-Italian boy who dreamed about being in the mafia and how he actually got a chance to do so.  The wonderful friendship between Jimmy played by Robert De Niro, Tommy played by Joe Pesci, and Henry as they grew from petty crimes to big time heist was wonderfully orchestrated by the director.  As if not interesting enough, the director grabs more of your attention when rules are broken and people start getting whack.  Henry who at this point has turn into a drug addict struggles to stay alive.  This movie keep you in suspense about what will happen to Henry in the end.
B000021XS0|4.0|Another DT album that's lost most of its impact over time.  I no longer find it to be anything resembling a masterpiece.  And I do not find DT to be particularly virtuosic, except in the most superficial sense and when compared to musicians that aren't even half way on the road to virtuosity (which isn't necessarily a destination of great virtue).  What's worse is that this album, like most DT material, has very little artistic depth and almost no emotional impact on me.  Some of the instrumental sections can be quite enjoyable in isolation, but they are almost invariably compromised by the annoying vocals and by excessive exhibitionism for its own sake.  On the bright side, this is another one of those albums that was an important early stepping stone in my exploration of much more valuable beyond-the-charts music.  This is what I had to say about it in September 2001: <br /> <br />\\"Virtuosic masterpiece with some key flaws: <br /> <br />1. Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci still lack subtlety and try too hard to impress, at the expense of the band. <br /> <br />2. Tracks 9-10 ('Dance of Eternity' and 'One Last Time') drag the album down. They might be better with some 'fat' trimmed off (both tracks start off well and then get long-winded and dull), but as they are they cause the album's otherwise awesome effect to fade after the excellent 'Home.'  <br /> <br />3. Track 11 is OK but considerably below standard compared to tracks 1-8 & 12. It has some dull parts.  <br /> <br />Die-hard DT fans and some aspiring instrumental virtuosos might not agree with some or all of the above remarks, but this album could achieve much broader appeal (without compromising integrity) and a more solid artistic impact if DT's leaders were better at judging when less is more and when enough if enough. They've already done too much to show us how much skills they have. It's time they started applying them to best serve the overall impact of their songs/compositions/albums. <br /> <br />The keyboard work is great, as is John Myong's relatively underrated bass-playing (which unfortunately is mixed to serve the guitar player).\\"

B000002LCE|5.0|The most refined work of the good part of Dio's solo career. Somewhat under-rated. Other obligatory albums include Holy Diver, Sacred Heart, Last in Line. Lock up the Wolves is also good, but not in the same league.  His best albums remain Rainbow Rising (Rainbow) and Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath).
B000021YQV|5.0|In a year that has had radical ups and downs in the music industry, from the ... of bands like Drowning Pool and Saliva. We've also gotten a handful of classic albums from some great bands (Radiohead, Opeth, Sigur Ros) and a few great surprizes (Fantomas, Primer 55) but Toxicity out shines all of them. <br />System of a Down is the one band where you have to have diverse musical tastes to pin point their influences. Faith No More, Frank Zappa, and the obvious Middle Eastern themes are still present from their S/T debut, but with Toxicity they've also developed their own sound. The guitar work is magic, just amazing chord progressions through out the whole album. Daron also does a great job with back up vocals. From his high pitched croon to his death vocals, he contrasts Serj perfectly. Shavo's bass work is great too, ranging from Tool like plucks to adding extra thickness to the guitars. The drumming is intense and pin point in every song too. Serj has turned into one of the best front men of the 90's, his range is great. He uses a tiny bit of death vocals here and there but has one of the most original singing voices I've ever heard. Songs like ATWA, Deer Dance, Chop Suey!, and well just about all of them show off his variation too. He also writes some great lyrics ranging from political (Prison Song, Deer Dance) to hilarious (Bounce, Shimmy, Psycho) to powerful (Chop Suey!, Aerials) hey spouts off his variation in this field every chance he gets too.<br />The album is nit together extremly well and has a certine amount of flow with it. Prison Song is a great opener with it's great riffs and variation. Deer Dance is a stand out track with a cool message and a great ending. Jet Pilot shows of an almost thrash edge with cryptic lyrics. Chop Suey! is a good choice of single with it's soft and heavy passages and even a tad of strings to it. Science has great guitars, and Psycho is one of the more interesting songs on the album. But the best songs are Aerials, ATWA, and Toxcity. ATWA has a very mellow pre chorus but has some of the heaviest moments on the cd with it's chorus, and Aerials is just beautiful with rad lyrics and a cool outro. Toxcity has great lyrics and the as we come to expect great chorus. <br />This is THE album which is going to influence the next generation of music. So go buy it now what's keeping you?
B000002J23|2.0|1980 found Yes without Jon Anderson or Rick Wakeman after the release of the mediocre Tormato.  And this is about as bad an album as they ever made.<br />What's Bad:<BR>It's just too much.  `Machine Messiah' could have been a decent track but it goes on forever and has time changes that are not at all necessary.  Trevor Horn's vocals are too close to Anderson's.  That's fine from an aesthetic point of view but it made the album sound more like a parody of Yes than Yes itself.  Keyboards lack depth and the lyrics lack their usual punch and emotion.  Steve Howe's playing seems, in places, sloppy and contrived.<br />What's Good:<BR>The keyboards, while the playing doesn't rival Wakeman's abilities, are interesting in that Geoff Downes does use sounds new to Yes, expanding their sonic palette.  We also hear more vocal contributions from Chris Squire on this outing which is a welcome change.  While the production is somewhat flat, there is definitely an energy here that can't be overlooked.<br />Yes would, of course, go on to ditch this lineup and reform with Trevor Rabin and Jon Anderson (along with Squire and White and original keyboardist Tony Kaye) and produce the popular 90125.  So, while this is really not at all a fantastic album, it does demand attention as an important piece of Yes history.
6305399212|4.0|Enough has been said about this film. It's fantastic, but this version takes something away from the original. It's like the original version of 'blade runner' - too much explanation, not enough gaps for thought. A great film almost ruined by commercialism.
B00005N9CV|5.0|The Look Of Love, Besame Mocho my favorite all time standards, this will bring back those days of wine and roses.  Diana's renditions are great as ever.  Her choices of songs really show off her moods and personality.  Exceptional piano work and the orchastration behind her is also done in good taste.  If you are a fan of Diana Krall it's a must to ad to your collection.

B00000HZH7|5.0|I bought this album in the mid-80s.  It was ahead of its time then, and still remains unprecedented in the beginning of the 21st century.  One could call it the pre-cursor to black metal, just as one would attribute the band 'Death' to death metal.  The vocals are satanic, evil, and ready to shock the face of music in the 1980s and beyond.  Anyone who listens to this will understand the grass roots of black metal; not only in the vocals and lyrics, but in the steadfast speed and precision that ALL black metal fans recognize today.
B0000029J5|5.0|I discovered Keb Mo several years ago at a live show...I am not a huge blues fan, but absolutely adore this CD.  I am actually buying my fourth copy tonight.  At the risk of ticking off the true blues fans who also love this CD, I would call this album &quot;light blues&quot;, or maybe even &quot;happy blues&quot;!?!  Sounds crazy, but the music has a certain snap to it that really energizes.  It is deeply soulful music without the weight.  I have his other albums, and believe this album is ESSENTIAL.  It is Keb Mo unprocessed.  (His later albums seem to be a sort of Keb Mo Velveeta...cryin' shame because I think this guy is the real deal.)
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This is the best album Duran Duran recorded. I don't think they ever recorded anything very disappointing. I always enjoy when they release something new so I can hear the new sounds. This CD has been through many Remasters but it's still a great set of songs no matter what FORM they are in. &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot;, &quot;Save A Prayer&quot;, &quot;My Own Way&quot;, &quot;The Chauffeur&quot; and &quot;New Religion&quot; are amongst my favorites. I remember staying up late many a night to see all their controversial videos that they would show only late at night. Especially the videos for &quot;Girls On Film&quot;, which appears on their debut album and &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;. Those videos and more are now available on various Video Collections.
0780622650|4.0|Although this movie did not have the best reputation as a worthy remake of a classic TV series, it was not too bad considering! First off the special effects were very beautiful for this movie. Especially the scenes were Dr. Smith( played excellently by Gary Oldman ) is mutated into a part human part spider monster. Excellent music by Bruce Broughton is very fitting to John Williams classic television score. And the redesign of the robot was excellent. However, the movie did lack a lot because of its major theme: family problems (particularly where Will Robinson feels more abandoned by his father who hardly has time for him or his whole family for that nature). Also it could have had more charm &amp; appeal without taking itself so seriously, and being so dysfunctional. To be honest, the original show was about family &amp; fun which was its secret ingrediant. Maybe if they made a better sequel where family problems are resolved, and they had more scenes with real action and danger (heck have the Jupiter 2 fall victim to more alien attacks) then you may get much better! We did at the start with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, and so we can with &quot;Lost in Space.&quot;
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is a great disc, I am a new Dianna Krall fan and this is by far my favorite all around disc so far. Classic songs mixed with new for a sound all her own. I especially like S'Wonderful and it just gets better from there - Don't miss out

B000002LCK|5.0|First off, I want to say that I have loved New Order ever since I heard &quot;Temptation&quot; in 1982. &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; is a perfect album; if you like this, you'll love that. On to this review: as you can read in the other reviews, this compiles an EP and a whole bunch o' singles with their B-sides in one handy place. It is an essential collection for anyone interested in either the origins of trance, dance, rave, and club music or in where high-end post-punk or goth disappeared to in the mid-1980s. New Order captured emotional states as diverse as utter despair (the phenomenal Joy Division left-over &quot;Ceremony&quot; and its relentless and haunting B-side &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;) and ecstatic (pun intended) joy (many of the later singles). A hidden gem: &quot;Lonesome Tonight&quot;. Two nits: I would have preferred to get the original mixes of &quot;Ceremony&quot; and especially &quot;Temptation&quot; on this set, leaving any remixes for a re-released CD single or some such.

He's funny and his observations are usually correct (though he could use some tact in sharing them), but as my boyfriend said (who was reading over my shoulder), &quot;Man, he's cranky.&quot;  That about sums it up, he's cranky and this is a cranky account of the US.<br />Granted, he went 6,000+ miles in 34 days or some ridiculous thing like that and subsisted on junk food for most of it.  That would make most of us pretty cranky.  But I think that America gets the shaft in this book.  There are plenty of wonderful things about being country folk, about family values, even about capitalism (though I agree with him, the Strip Mall is out of control). <br />I also think that his quest is a bit misguided as he skipped some of the best &quot;little towns&quot; out there, such as Santa Barbara (which he probably would have said was too &quot;rich&quot;), Ithaca, NY (too &quot;hippy&quot;), New Canaan, CT (again, too &quot;hoity toity&quot;) and Chapel Hill, NC (well, it's just about perfect).  Maybe he should do this again, and we could help him out?! And why stop in NYC at all?  Why not Boston?  It had no rhyme or reason and PLEASE someone tell him that Columbus Day is not the time to go to Cape Cod.  Every other weekend it is a beautiful, idyllic place.<br />Ok, I'm rambling.  Final word: funny in parts, but way too critical and perhaps I am just feeling a bit patriotic these days, but I love America.
B00003CXS4|5.0|From the very opening shots of Orthodox Jews walking through the screen gates, Snatch is a real mouth-opener. When they take the guns out and this mad Big Beat track kicks in, I was hit with a burst of energy I haven't experienced since first watching Reservoir Dogs. Snatch is a funny, dizzy, violent gem, full of inventive camera and editing techniques, hillarious dialogue (I watched it 3 times and I already know the whole damn thing by heart - and I'm not even a native English speaker) and memoriable performances. Undoubtedly, the best scene is the lecture on the proper feeding of bodies to pigs given by Brick Top to Vinnie, Sol and whatever the guy played by Goldie is named (&quot;You know what nemesis is?&quot;), with Brick Top's goons clutching cleavers and saws in the cellophane wrapped room (&quot;4 days...I kid you not!&quot;). The most memorable character is of course Boris The Blade, the &quot;sneaky f...g Russian&quot; (&quot;Case attached to his arm? Why didn't you chop it off??&quot;). I see I get a little carried away...
B00004WG28|5.0|&quot;Anna and The King&quot; is a wonderful movie filled with heart and soul.  Especially if you have watched, &quot;The King and I&quot; and have fallen in love with the way the king says &quot;etc, etc, etc...&quot;, you will definitely fall in love with this movie as well.<BR>Jodie Foster looks beautiful in her English gown and Chow-Yun Fat and the rest of the crew looks absolutely brilliant in the Siamese outfits.<BR>The scenes shot in Malaysia are breath-taking and it makes you want to visit the country, itself.  <BR>The search for the white elephant at the end of the movie with the kids of the king is very inspiring.
B000021YQV|4.0|In this day and age of music, it is quite hard to lump bands into a particular genre.  Yes, System of a Down is catagorized as a &quot;hardcore&quot; heavy metal band, but this album definately defies the boundaries.<br />TOXICITY is an excellent follow-up album.  It shakes up the typical flow of a heavy metal album in that it begins with a soft acoustic guitar, only to delve into harsh power chords and screaming chants.  To throw more of a mix into the album, the subtle sound of a piano can be heard.  What makes this album so good, is that this strategic switching is constant throughout.<br />Lead vocalist, Serj Tankian, stands out strong with his unique voice amongst the melodic chaos.  It's as if the band wants to present some type of structure to the music's disorderly inclinations.  Yet, the vocals do change throughout the album.  It is quite extraordinary, making all of the songs really interesting to listen to.<br />Most of the lyrics are quite laudatory and compliment the album's sound and overall mood.  The poetic verses of &quot;Prison Song&quot; are truly amazing, standing out on the album exceptionally well.  Other awesome tracks include the viciously heavy &quot;Chop Suey,&quot; and wonderful guitar-heavy &quot;Shimmy&quot; and &quot;Science.&quot;<br />TOXICITY is a very unique album in that System of a Down utilizes their middle eastern influences to defy their music format.  There is a wonderful overall sound with several well-made songs.  As the band tears down their music boundaries and revolutionizes their genre, you can't help but enjoy this album.
B000002JSJ|3.0|...but if you're a Zep fan you gotta have it for &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; and &quot;Achilles Heel&quot;
B00005NOZ6|5.0|I have been a fan since the days of Images and Words.  I eerie coincidence behind the artwork and the release of this album have brought me critisism from my peers for owning, save listening to this record.  I say tough S#*T!  Dream Theater's music is too good to let some circumstantial information keep me from owning it.  But just to show I care, I think we should all blare Track 2 of CD 2.
B000056H24|3.0|It's unlikely that He traveled much more than a hundred miles from where he as born, He never wrote a book and historical records make note of only 30 or so days of His life. Yet He impacted history more than any other life. Hollywood has made a number of films on the life of this man named Jesus. He's often portrayed as a pretty, blue-eyed Caucasian a la Jeffrey Hunter in the under-rated \\"King of Kings\\" (crudely referred to as \\"I was a Teen Age Jesus\\" during production). New on DVD is George Stevens' massive, stately, \\"GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD\\". Although the box says this is the restored roadshow version at three hours and 19 minutes, it's my understanding the original release was nearly an hour longer. Stevens corralled just about every star in Hollywood for a cameo and it was distracting on initial release, but not so viewing it today as many of these once famous faces are less so. The film has wonderfully composed shots, in majestic or minimalist sets with exquisite lighting and deep shadows. Max von Sydow is about as good as one can expect in an impossible role. However, a stop-motion puppet Jesus from Russia with the voice of Ralph Fiennes is probably the most artistic and powerful of all movie Christs in \\"THE MIRACLE MAKE\\". This remarkable look at the life of Jesus as seen through the eyes of Jairus' daughter, a girl Jesus raised from the dead, is haunting and beautiful. Filmed as a coproduction with Mel Gibson's Icon Entertainment in association with a 2-D animation house in Wales and a 3-D puppet and miniature crew from Moscow. The end result is a marvelous piece of filmmaking that gets better on repeated viewings. The meaning of this solitary Life is not diluted in any way. Other characters are voiced by Julie Christie, Richard Grant, William Hurt and Miranda Richardson. The wonderfully evocative flute-heavy score is by Anne Dudley. The \\"making of\\" featurette is worth the price of the disc.
0380796090|5.0|I love Marian's books.  I just finished this - and I really enjoyed the characters.  I also read Rachel's Holiday, which is even better!!  A must read! :)
6304366078|5.0|When Grand Prix was first released, I was the ripe old age of 4 years. My introduction to opend-wheeled racing was in Pau, France in 1982, as a college student studying abroad. I snuck into a Formula 3 event in downtown Pau, France. Standing 10 feet from the track, I will never forget the ferocious sound and awesome speed of the Gitanes sponsored Ligier Formula 1 race care doing a few demonstration laps prior to the Formula 3 race. Since that day I have been addicted to the sound and speed of Formula 1 racing. The only way to supplement this fix between races and during the off season is with movies about racing and races on tape. When I first began watching Grand Prix, I assumed it would be a dated, silly, and testorone fueled film, like Stalone's worthless vision of CART racing. Instead, it was a realistic portrayal of racers. Though critics may talk of poor character development and a thin plot, they fail to recognize that this isn't about global politics. It is simply a movie about racers and the siren song of speed. The movie has some of the best in car footage I have seen to date.  For those who love racing, you will love this movie.  For those who know nothing about racing, nor care to learn, this film will probably disappoint.
B000002GHH|5.0|I bought this album about 11-12 years ago and it still sounds as fresh today as it did back then.<br />There are many reasons for the staying power of this album. First of all, the songwriting...Hiatt is quite simply one of the best there is. His lyrics are brilliant -- sort of a midwestern Elvis Costello -- and he fuses it with great melodies and hooks.<br />Another great draw here is the musicianship. Forgoing past arrangments of synths and overblown instrumentation, Hiatt sticks to a four-piece band...and what a band it is. In addition to John himself on vocals and acoustic guitar, there's Ry Cooder on guitar, Nick Lowe on bass and session ace Jim Keltner on drums -- you can't go wrong there. The playing is steady, assured, and rocks like crazy.<br />Highlights for me include &quot;Memphis in the Meantime&quot; (one of my favorite Hiatt songs, lyrically speaking), the rocking &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; and the touching &quot;Lipstick Sunset,&quot; which contains the best singing I've ever heard from Hiatt. If you don't own any John Hiatt discs, this is a great place to start. Not a weak track in the whole bunch. Other great discs include &quot;Slow Turning,&quot; &quot;Stolen Moments&quot; and the new one, &quot;The Tiki Bar is Open.&quot;
B000001Y42|4.0|This CD is a really great debut. It has plenty of songs all metal fans should like, like &quot;Pollution&quot;, &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, and &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot;. Although it gets slighty stale towards the end (right after &quot;Faith&quot;) with mostly filler (&quot;Stalemate&quot;), anything before that is in-your-face awesome. If they would have just made songs 2-7 and song 9 and made it into an EP, this could have been one of the finest pieces of rock. But even though they didn't, it's still pretty cool.<br />Favorite songs: Pollution, Counterfeit, Stuck, Nobody Loves Me, Sour, Stalemate, Faith
B00005K3GS|5.0|I fell in love with Modjo's three single releases before I got the album: Lady (hear me tonight), Chillin', and What I Mean (a new single that I haven't seen for sale in the US yet).<br />While some dance/techno/pop albums have some incredibly strong tracks, they use filler to complete the album. NOT SO with Modjo. With exception to Track #4 (Too Good to be True...an easy 1 minute track to pass by) and Track #1 (Acknowledgement...maybe they want to explain that one?) every other song completes an incredible picture of groovin' tunes.<br />While Lady and Chillin are definate club hits, there are other pop-like songs with catchy lyrics (Peace of Mind) and beautiful harmonies (Savior Eyes). And Modjo especially delivers the goods on some bass-thumpin songs (On Fire, No More Tears, and Music Takes You back).<br />I'd venture to say some of the styles are a healthy mix of Daft Punk and Jamiraquai, however their style becomes their own after a few listenings of the CD. Highly, highly recommended release!
0790744295|5.0|This is has and will always be a favorite flic of mine. What is cooler than combining a great set of horror tales with a comic book backdrop? I enjoyed all the tales in this movie, however, &quot;Father's Day&quot; is above all my favorite (with &quot;The Crate&quot; running neck-and-neck). Great special effects! I got my cake!
B00005LMBK|5.0|I've been listening to this album at least three times a day since I got it a week ago.  It's goofy yet dark.  You can dance to most of it, you can lay on your couch and watch the picture show on your ceiling while listening to it, you can do pretty much anything to it, and it will be a perfect accompaniment.
B00003IPFK|5.0|Hands down this is our favorite movie. We named our daughter Clara after Anjelica Huston's character.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Leave it to Disney to take the most important event of the 2oth century for the USA and make it an uninspired love story.  I found some of the lines laughable and without a true understanding of the time and the people who lived it.  Hollywood has repeatedly treated the viewing public with contempt.  They believe that if you give the public alot of eye candy (Millions of dollars worth of CGI and good-looking acting hacks), the substance and quality of the script is irrelevant.  That's like building a designer home with a foundation made of balsa wood.  Such a moment in our history should have been treated with more respect and greater attention to detail.  If Disney had done that, instead of trying to cash in on a Titanic-esque story, they would have made alot more money (which is all that they are really interested in).
B00005NZBN|4.0|&quot;Love And Theft&quot; is so chock-full of lyrical delights, the vocals barely stop for a breath between beats, and the music becomes almost incidental to the rapid ramblings that are as fine as Dylan's written compositions have ever been. The words collectively sound like one soliloquy set to varying degrees of old time blues and ragtime pop. Where his previous album, &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; came from a man resigned to inevitable mortality, &quot;Love And Theft&quot; is a renewed lease forever indebted to the pusuit of a good smoke, a stiff drink, or those well-deserved divorce papers. The music is sparse and maybe too ordinary but there's a haunting off-key echo from the roller rink organ in the easy-tempo &quot;Bye and Bye&quot;, a musical metaphor of Dylan finally accepted as a mainstream American master. &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; has some precious guitar strums and emotionally cascading musical drama serving as an authoritive anchor to the light and airy tone of the album. It's the vocals though that make &quot;Love And Theft&quot; so magnetizing and personal. Like listening to a dear old friend with a generously blessed gift for gab.
B000002J1S|5.0|This is possibly the most inventive and creative album of the entire Genesis catalogue. It totally makes you forget about the pop smack that the group (or the fraction of the group that remains) has been putting out for the last 15-20 years. Peter Gabriel tells a vibrantly impenetrable story here. Usually, for a concept album, impenetrability is a great detraction, but not here; it opaqueness actually adds to this album's overall appeal. I want to sit and try to figure out exactly what's going on, not only in the lyrics, but also in the music. Steve Hackett was still with the group at this point, and it is wonderfully refreshing. His noodling (just on the quiet side of Robert Fripp and on the more serene side of Steve Howe) always has a purpose. He strikes the strings in classical precission which few rock guitarist seem to be able to pull off. Tony Banks is ever the tasteful British piano master; even when he allows his synths to shriek and scream, there is always some apparent meaning. <BR>This album is like no other you will ever own. On par with Selling England By the Pound, but so different that it seems like two totally different groups.
0380817683|3.0|I was looking forward to a long weekend and a good laugh when I opened this book.  I was disappointed. I certainly didn't &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; which is what several of the reviews promised.  I can't say that it didn't keep my interest, because it did, and there were a couple of amusing situations, but funny is the last word I would use describe it.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I am pre-ordering TODAY!! I remember watching TRON when I was little (about 8 if I remember). And watched it almost every year after that. I must have rented the same tape quite a few times!! What a joy to find out it is going to be released in a DVD anniversary edition!!<br />The special effects were marvelous for the time! The neo-fantastic colors and graphics were well made for a movie before its time! It was so weird (and now that I look back, philosophical) to have each &quot;program&quot; given a human body. Makes you think what AI will &quot;really&quot; think about us when/if we ever perfect it. And, more importantly the story line. When it all comes down to it, the basic's of the movie is man against machine (and we all know who wins that battle). The music is the icing on the cake. The synthesizer back-tech sounds will amaze you. (for the time of the movie)<br />Popcorn and soda in front of the TV (with your kids if you have any), and see the movie that you will not forget.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This album is great. If you are a fan of Dylans buy this album.
B000002UAX|5.0|Back in 1968 there was a magazine(whose name escapes me at this moment) that reviewed Beggars Banquet by The Rolling Stones as well as &quot;The Beatles&quot;.  They called the White album a 90 minute bore.  It was and is always fashonable to prefer a Stones album over a &quot;Fabs&quot;.  But then there is reality. As Harrison said in the Anthology what do you do when you have all that ego &amp; all those songs to get rid of.  Yes there is a bit too much &quot;filler&quot; on the CD, but looking at this album here in the 21st century it runs the gamit of musical styles.  &quot;Pop&quot; &quot;Rock&quot; &quot;Alternative&quot; &quot;R&amp;B&quot; &quot;Country&quot; and even some early form of &quot;Techno&quot; within Revolution #9. There is a very easy argument that sure it could have been a great single lp but it's simply a Great double lp!  With all the breakneck shift in various styles one is never mired in one format for long.  Lennon especially is in exquisite form.  After this he would be forever overly poisoned by Yoko.  His vocals alone on I'm So Tired showcase how he was by far the most gifted vocalist rock has ever seen.  It's a most enjoyable listen over &amp; over. And you that's Good News!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is the first Dylan album that I've unreservedly loved since &quot;Desire&quot;. Lyrically this is pure, unique Dylan, sketching characters and scenes, turning cliches on their heads, with some jokes that made me laugh out loud (loved the cameos by Shakespeare characters). Dylan's voice might be a wreck, but his phrasing is superb here - listen to him singing around the beat of &quot;Po' Boy&quot;. When Dylan's not engaged in his music a sure sign is perfunctory singing - try &quot;Empire Burlesque&quot;, for example, if you can bear it.<br />The band hammers the blues songs and performs the ballads sublimely, making this the best played Dylan album since &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;. A lot of the songs have generic melodies, but hell, the genres are wonderful. And three of the songs are Dylan classics - &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Po' Boy&quot;, &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;.<br />Who would have thought that a 60 year old Dylan, who has sounded jaded and only intermittently inspired for decades, could knock out this rough, brilliant album? Thanks a bunch Zimmy.
B00005LMBK|2.0|I regret of buying this CD. It has about 4 desent songs and all other once are a waist.
B00005N9CV|3.0|This album is very similar to her last. Her singing is getting better, but there's no evidence that she's one of the top jazz pianists out there.  It's a nice mellow album - great arrangements. I rate it a three because I was expecting to hear more &quot;jazz&quot; -- more of her brilliant musicianship.  I guess its a money thing.
B000002UAO|5.0|Little hints of a comming change could be found earlier in songs like &quot;I'm A Loser&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot;,and &quot;You've Got To Hide Your Love Away&quot;.  But this just blew the teeny boppers in to the last train to Clarksville.  They didn't like the cover.  Didn't understand the lyrics.  Boy I'd bet the farm(Maggies Farm at that)they Beatles couldn't have cared less.  From it's trend setting cover to 14 scintilating traxs The Beatles successfully killed off their &quot;POP&quot; image and Rock was truely born.  Lennon(heavily influenced by Dylan) unleashed great introspective lyrical prowess.  Harrison moved solidly into the forefront as a writer with 2 excellent songs.  They even altered their singing styles because they could.  Oh and they also had to leave off &quot;Day Tripper&quot; &amp; &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; because they were singles and it was wrong(in the UK anyway) to include singles on albums.  A sheer delight from beginning to end.  The Woord is GOOD!
B000002OR4|5.0|I liked this music because it is both haunting and a part of us and it should remind us on who we are.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|In short I loved this movie! I have seen it 8 times and am still finding new clues every time i have watched. In a year of many blockbuster films that left much to be desired (i.e. Pearl Harbor, Evolution), it was nice to see an amazing film like this one make money simply on quality and word of mouth-not overdone special effects. Guy Pearce captures the tortured Leonard perfectly and Carrie-Anne Moss is amazing as the femme fatale. It  has been so long since a movie that required actual brain power has gotten any press at all that those who didnt like this movie probably just enjoy sitting around watching films where what will happen next is so blatantly obvious a sponge could figure it out. For those of you who enjoy a movie with intelligence, rush out and see this movie right now. you wont regret it.
B00005NW02|5.0|Excellent album - highly recommended. Was well worth the wait.
B000002UAR|5.0|How great were these guys and this collection of traxs?  Well just keep in mind that they left off Paperback Writer and Rain which were also recorded during these sessions.  They really should have left off &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; just because it doesn't fit.  But all the rest of them are breath takingly innovative.  Go back and listen to the rest of the music scene from this era and see what I mean.  No longer happy with being looked at as a &quot;POP&quot; group they not only push the envelope here they rip right through it.  For anyone else such a drastic change would have been career suicide. But then again they had already made such a drastic shift 8 months before with &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.  Fans either held on or got tossed aside with the rubble.  Like &quot;Rubber Soul before it, The Beatles did it in the &quot;art for arts sake&quot; mentality. Then of course to show their unconcern for image and cash for cash sake they would quit touring 25 days after this albums release! Get this CD into your life!
B00003CXX8|4.0|Trailers say too much about their movies these days, giving away too many secrets so that any impact the actual film will have is weakened. &quot;The Glass House&quot; is no exception, but while the trailer lets us in on the movie's secrets, the suspense behind them comes out unscathed. You may know what will happen, but getting there is quite a ride in this uniquely stylish teenage thriller. <br />The film stars Leelee Sobieski as Ruby Baker, who lives like any typical teenager going to prep school in Los Angeles and sneaking out of her house at night. On the night of her parents' 20th wedding anniversary, she comes home to discover them killed in a car wreck, leaving her and her young brother Rhett in the care of their former next-door neighbors, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane). Soon after the funeral, it's off the Malibu, and the beginning of a whole new life. <br />The Glass house itself is made up of much glass, inside and out, providing a creepy atmosphere where things are constantly uneasy. From the get-go, Ruby gets the feeling that she is being watched, and the fact that her new guardians continuously shower them with gifts seems more like a purchase of their trust. As the months go by, things begin to lose their luster: Terry begins to make not-so-subtle passes at Ruby, whose quest for information surrounding the death of her parents leads her to believe that her new caretakers may have played a part in the accident. <br />Due to the revelations the trailer makes, the movie loses its surprise factor, something it considerably suffers from. It gives away the fact that the Glasses are out to attain the childrens' inheritance to pay off loan sharks, therefore diminishing the effect this would have had it been left a surprise. Not only that, but it gives away many plot twists, including the finale, which begins by denying the heroine the right to take part in the final confrontation, and then resurrects the villain once more so that shecan.<br />Still, I found much of the film to be fitfully interesting, due to the level of suspense the movie is able to achieve. Ruby's search for clues provides some very tense moments, such as a scene in which she sends an email to her parents' former legal consultant, only to discover the next day that her AOL account is closed. Was it closed by Terry, or because the account was not paid off due to her parents' death? Terry also provides her with an English report that she believes is his original work, though it turns out to be that of a published author, landing her in the hot seat at school. <br />Scenes like these manage to create a sense of slight psychological fear, while resurrecting the movie from a certain downfall. The movie also hits a high note by sticking to slow-building suspense rather than cheap shocks. So many teenage thrillers latch on to the old-school tricks of bloody gore and quick jumps, but &quot;The Glass House&quot; manages to create an atmosphere that gets under your skin just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for much of the story. <br />The cast also brings the movie to a high point, featuring commendable performances all around. Leelee Sobieski rises above most actresses her age, instilling a bravery and strength in her character that makes her strong and believable. Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard are fitfully mysterious as the Glasses, and, in some cases, almost spine-tingling. The interaction between the cast makes a sometimes silly story easy to stomach, especially the film's final resolution. <br />&quot;The Glass House&quot; manages to stray from the usual violent gore and gruesome bloodshed that permeates many modern teenage thrillers, and gives us a story that provides some good suspense and fine performances. The trailer is a giveaway, though, and will diminish most of the film's effect for those who like to be left in the dark. But, put that aside, and you'll find that there's more to this movie than its previewsreveal.
B000000OAN|5.0|Queen's modestly titled &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was a musical tour-de-force, and effectively launched the group into the stratosphere and rock legend.  Much has been said about &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; but tracks like &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life&quot; could only have been pulled off by this band.  Pure inspiration and genius.  God save the Queen!
B0000508U6|5.0|This is going to sound like a weird comparison.<br />When Mark Sandman died in 1999, I was certain that I would never love another new song again.  Sandman's work touched me (like it did a lot of people) in an undescribable way, both musically and lyrically.  I really believed nothing would reach that level again.<br />Then came Coldplay, with Parachutes.  Absolutely, hands down, one of my top ten albums of all time.  I never thought I'd say this about a &quot;guitar&quot; band, but the music is incredible.  The lyrics, although simple, are heart-wrenching or inspiring.  The singing, while not operatic, is impressive and emotional.<br />I have rocked out and wept while listening to this album, and can't wait to hear more from this great band.
B00003CXA2|5.0|One interpretation of the movie is that of having opinions and siding one way or the other on issues. Forrest Gump doesn't seem to have an opinion about anything, except for a general optimism. When he runs across the country, reporters catch up to him and ask whether he is running for the environment, women's rights, or world peace, or what. He replies, \\"I just feel like runnin'!\\" He wins the medal of honor in Vietnam yet loves a girl who is mixed in with people who oppose the war. When Forrest makes a speech about the war, the plug is pulled and we don't hear a word he says about it. A Black Panther gives him a stern lecture about his group's ideology, but Forrest is tuned out, only paying attention to Jenny. Forrest explains many things as \\"and for no particular reason at all...\\" for example, the shootings of several famous people in his lifetime. When Forrest meets the president all he has to say about it is he loved how there was free Dr. Pepper and free food. <br />He goes through many turbulent times in our nation's history and is tuned out of them but by no means totally tuned out of life. He has fierce determination, as when he runs with all his might on the football field for the touchdown, then continues into the locker room at full speed. Although stupid, he is still a very dynamic character who succeeds at everything he does, and still remains a nice guy. With all his success adding up he does not become cocky or corrupted or lose vision of what really matters. He inspires many others and spreads his good influence around very well and doesn't even realize how great he is. Forrest moves through a world which is increasingly becoming less moral, more violent and confused. Yet he manages to leave the world a little better than he found it. <br />I can't totally agree with the thought that the film portrays sexuality as immoral. Recall that Forrest's mother had sex with the principal to get her son into a mainstream school. Also, Forrest has an illegitimate child to which Jenny assures him he did nothing wrong. The kid turns out just fine and Forrest turns out to be a great father. Some think the film tells us that conformity and following orders unquestioningly will lead to success. Why, then, does Forrest blatantly disobey Lt. Dan's order to leave him in the woods and instead, save his life? Also, when Forrest prepares to buy his own shrimp boat, everyone tells him he's stupid to do that but he simply replies \\"Stupid is as stupid does, sir\\" and goes ahead with his promise and his dream to go into the shrimping business. <br />Despite the inspiring action throughout the movie by Forrest, the movie ends sadly. Also, being that Jenny apparently died of AIDS which was a new disease back then, there is a strong possibility Forrest has it, too being that Jenny is his wife. But one message of the movie is that we all die sooner or later and that dying is a part of life. <br />Will the story of Forrest Gump make you feel inspired? Probably. Will it actually change your life? I doubt it. It would be great if only this were a true story but it isn't.
B00005LC4B|4.0|&quot;Cape Fear&quot; has two different complexes: one is that of a smart, spine-tingling psychological thriller, and the other is that of a revenge thriller. Martin Scorsese's remaking of the 1962 classic captures some of the previous film's essential mind game elements, while adding its own mix of violence that is kept to a minimum until being released in a frenzy in the finale. All of this works surprisingly well, but after the film ends, it has a certain sense of underachievement hanging over its head. <br />The film stars Robert De Niro as ex-con Max Cady, just released from prison, out for a taste of revenge against his former attorney, Sam Bowden, played by Nick Nolte. Bowden has his own family troubles to begin with: he is having an affair behind his wife Leigh's back, and his daughter Danielle is going through the perilous years of teenage woes. He becomes increasingly uneasy when Cady begins appearing out of nowhere to confront him with psychological games, and fears that he may harm his family. <br />It's parts like these that make actors great, and each one relishes their part like no other film I've seen. Robert De Niro takes twisted to a whole new level, portraying Cady as a smart yet cagey psychopath. There are times when his presence is enough to chill you to the bone. Nolte's performance is equally intense, especially later in the film, when he begins to cave in on himself trying to rid himself of Cady. <br />Cady does not make is very easy for Bowden, though. He brutalizes the woman Bowden is having the affair with, poisons the family dog and later returns to return the collar, denying his involvement in the animal's death. Turning to the law, Bowden is stunned to learn that nothing can be done because of the lack of no physical evidence, and, in turn, decides to take matters into his own hands to protect his family. <br />Martin Scorsese gives his film a sense of style parallel to that of Hitchcock, from the high-strung soundtrack to fancy cameraangles and shots. There are times when the camera is fixed in a still position, while at others it moves steadily, non-stop. Some scenes in which one actor is close to the camera, while the other is seen off to the side, give the movie an unconventional feel, calling us back to the days of thrillers long ago. Scorsese is a true director, and his attention to story and style are unmatched by many. <br />The mind games that Cady plays on the Bowden family are cold and mysterious, the perfect mix of intelligence and insanity. His attack on Bowden's mistress causes a stir between he and Leigh, but the real tingler is a very effective scene that takes place in a school auditorium as Cady begins to dig into the mind of Danielle, preying on her teenage rebellion against her parents in an attempt to win her over. His plan is completely insane in its purpose, but utterly intellectual in its careful planning. <br />It's only a shame that this wonderful assault on the psyche is almost ruined by an ending that is standard, run-of-the-mill concluding material that leaves us little surprise. It takes a well-known path in which the people we guess will die do die, leaving those we wish would die alive. There is no shock or stunned amazement, no look of disbelief on our faces, because nothing is different. <br />This adds to the movie's feeling of underachievement, as it had so many things going for it. Instead of ending the film the way we have already guessed, it may have been more intriguing to see Cady use his mind tricks to further his revenge, until he exacts the ultimate revenge on Bowden by landing him in jail for attempted murder. This would be a perfect crowning to his plan, while giving us an ending that is truly original. <br />Still, &quot;Cape Fear&quot; has quite a few good things going for it. The style and substance work well together, as do the separate angles of the story and the wonderful cast, who play their parts to the extreme. The ending may fall short of the material, but the uneasy feeling I got in my chair must account for something, and that is the undeniable sense of suspense and dread, inspired by a psychological war that is effectively chilling.
B000002JK4|3.0|The title and cover say it all.  And the reviews here are all accurate in describing the album.  Plant's second solo album sees him largely trying to get away from the Zep sound, and deconstructing the heavy riffs.  &quot;Big Log&quot; was a big surprise at the time with its (if you saw it) existentialist video.  This was the guy that sang in Led Zep?  People were surprised.  But Big Log and In the Mood have indeed as one reviewer puts it below, become Plant melancholy classics.  The main criticism with this album is that the instrumentation is deliberately sparse and sometimes mechanical.  But hats off to Plant for trying something different here, and succeeding in parts.  Anyone buying this album will probably have a few favourite songs from it, but as an album in entirety - it's a bit too minimalistic!
B000000OSW|1.0|Being a big fan of Peter Gabriel from the days of his first solo album, I don't know where he wanted to go with this record.<br />It appears to be a fusion of popular '80s style music and 'world music'.  Not only does this not work, it actually got on my nerves.  Perhaps many other people find this enjoyable, but for my money Security is the best buy.  It brings new musical ideas to mind without forcing the listener to accept a new style of music that may not be pleasing to the western ear.
0684853523|4.0|If you are looking for a how to book, this ain't it. The book, looks at King's life, and the events which shaped him, inspired him to write. Still, in a funny, twisted way, (not unlike his novels) I came away with several ideas as to how I could tune my writing. You may not get what you expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.
6303477259|5.0|Do not think whether to buy it or not. Just buy it!
B000002JKS|1.0|I'm surprised to still see this on sale! Contrary to the reviews here, this was an experimental album that flopped for this reviewer.<BR>The songs are dodgy and Plant's musical direction is muddled.

B00005ATQD|5.0|Kubrick's final film is also one of his best, despite popular opinion and critical consensus. The film is an explosive examination of the struggle in a relationship between carnal desires and desires of emotional companionship. The film suggests that it's a near impossibility to achieve both without a considerable amount of work. It suggests marriage is a constant struggle to balance the two. <br />In the film's opening shot Kidman's character is seen from the back as she sheds her dress. This begins a big theme in the film which equates the face with the companionship side of a relationship, and the back or the masked face with the carnal desires. This is the most obvious symbol used throughout the film, and it would be exceptionally difficult to read the film without realizing it. Most people who criticize the film (both posts here and professional critics) don't seem to realize this however. <br />A lot of the film's prerelease hype dealt with the film's sexual content and it's recreation of NY City on a London soundstage. It seems as if most responses to the film address these points, when the film's really about neither. The film isn't about sex. It's about emotions that create and destroy relationships. Any mature individual should realize there's a huge difference between the two. The film isn't about NY City either. The incorrect period details that appeared to some to be technical gaffes are inconsequential, and in some ways add to the feeling that the film's journey is not meant to be taken on a literal level anyway.<br />The film's based on &quot;Traumanovelle&quot; (Dream Novel) by Schnitzler and there's a real sense in the film that the dream that Alice (Nicole Kidman) describes near the film's end is as relevant as the &quot;real&quot; journey taken by the main character Bill (Tom Cruise). It's interesting that the film, through the use of a mask that Alice apparently finds, and through the description of her dream closely mirroring Bill's journey, suggests both characters desires are the same. The film was derided for being prudish in its display of sexuality, but I cannot think of many other American films that have been brave enough to allow a woman to be a man's sexual equal without turning her into a cartoon of some sort. The film recognizes the difference between sex and sexuality, a distinction that is not as widely held as one might think. <br />Above all, this is a truly adult film. Sexual and emotional fulfillment are both important in a relationship. This film manages to take that thesis and explore it in truly provacative ways. To suggest it's a failure is to probably to suggest you were searching in it for something that it doesn't attempt to give. Few films manage to be as psychologically complex as this one. I haven't even mentioned the exceptional performances by Kidman and Cruise, the unparalleled lighting, or the many nuances in emotions that cause the film to go farther than just about any film on the subject, but Amazon restricts me to a 1000 word review. I think it goes without saying that I would reccomend this film. It's one of the few true masterpieces of the 90's, even if it took me a third viewing to realize how phenomenal it was.
B000007SIJ|3.0|We all know that this is a classic album, but how does the 5.1 mix hold up?  Well, to start off with, my biggest gripe is that 'Space Intro', the original opening track, is NOT EVEN ON THIS CD!  You hear a few seconds of it, then the title track starts.  On top of that, the title track is the short version!  When I pay ($) for a newly remastered album, I want the orignal album - Is that too much to ask?!?!<br />As far as the mix, the sound quality is very good and the mix is clean and spatious, but the rear channels have an incredible amount of hiss as times, the only time I've ever heard this on a DTS disc.<br />In summary, if you like the album, you'll like this, but let the buyer beware.  Recommended with some strong reservations...
B000002JKS|1.0|I'm surprised to still see this on sale!

B00005N9CV|1.0|Anyone got milk?? 'Cause this CD is totally homogenized. I discovered that almost each and every song sounds the SAME! If you listen to the intros for all tracks, they are very, very similar. Several reasons why I am not impressed with this \\"highly anticipated\\":<br />1)Diana seems to have caught the bossa nova bug. For 1 or 2 tracks, that's fine, but an ENTIRE album dedicated to this Latino sound is beyond me. Way too homogenized of a sound, no variety. Songs were very similar to her previous album.<br />2)Diana is breaking away from her piano playing and just adding a few notes and lightly tickled trills here and there, which frankly is annoying. Either play or don't play.<br />3)It's clear that Diana is eager to push her image and become some sort of jazz \\"sex kitten\\". Please. We don't need dozens of pictures of you with legs and cleavage to understand that you want to be attractive. I don't think anyone is twisting her arm to do that.<br />4)Sound quality is not good.<br />5)I'm getting tired of all these lush, huge orchestra arrangements. To me, it clouds an otherwise beautiful song.<br />6)Not impressed with Diana's vocals. I'd rather hear her play. Too many breathy, torchy, sappy, love songs.<br />7)Apparently has a thing for the words \\"look\\" and \\"love\\".....\\"LOVE Scenes\\", \\"When I LOOK in your eyes\\", \\"The LOOK of LOVE\\". What's the deal with that??<br />8)Obviously headed to catch the Crossover Bus to Midtown Popville. Is there NO ONE who can stay true to their genre?
6304913176|3.0|\\"Starship Troopers\\" is a run-of-the-mill sci-fi action movie, when a space draft is set in order for high school students to enlist in the intergalactic war against giant predatory bugs (gore aplenty).<br />This movie may seemed cliched, but it's robust, entertaining, and sexy to make up for it. That alone is for renting and/or buying for. (Also, for the female viewers, they have Jake Busey and Casper Van Dien who bare as much as R-rated movie can allow.) But it's definitely not for the squeamish.<br />Rated R for graphic violence and gore, language, and nudity.
B00001OH7U|5.0|This album is classic Bowie, and captures him in the middle of a tremendous decade that started with Hunky Dory and would end with Scary Monsters.  Enough said.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I snatched this up the first day it came out.  I had it preordered actually... :)  The new special edition is what we have been longing for.  There are so many extras you can just immerse yourself in Akira for quite some time.<br />the biggest thing is the new translation and dub.  Although I'll have to admit I didn't mind the original, and I kind of miss the voice of Leonardo (the teenge mutant ninja turtle) as Kaneda.  The new translation makes the story a bit more understandable to those who haven't been privy to the comic story.  And it was nice to hear the names pronounced correctly too.  (Kaneda's name was pronounced kah-neh-da with no stress instead of ka-NEY-duh)<br />This is a must for any die-hard anime fan.  This is a great way to get people into watching japanese animation, and with the more understandable storyline, it makes more sense to them.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Bowie should revive this into a musical.  The brilliance of Bowie and the boys has never been more evident.  Ziggy played guitar and a legend was born.  This was the one that launched Bowie into stardom and it's a classic.  Get it.
B0000048YO|5.0|This film never quite makes famous &quot;top&quot; lists, probably because of its cop-out ending. But ignore the ending and savor the rest. The film is brimming with sexual tension, both on the surface and in the subtext. Rita Hayworth is ravishingly beautiful and downright hot,a fascinationg femme fatale whose sexuality teases and torments men. Glen Ford plays Johnny Farrell, a gambler who is misogynistic, sexually ambiguous, and caught in a love-hate relationship with Hayworth's Gilda. As a rich casino owner, George McCready has both Ford and Hayworth under his command, and with both of them there is some ambiguity as to how much of his control is financial and how much is sexual.<br />The scipt offers some great,psychologically cutting lines and every character is a joy to watch. And when all is said and done, Hayworth's &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot;  strip-tease is one of the high points in American popular culture.  I can only guess at what the response to it must have been like in the tame 1940s.
B000002JNG|4.0|Robert's solo career was coming along nicely at this stage and Manic Nirvana was his most polished album.  Diverse, slick and well produced - it was a good follow up to Now &amp; Zen, which boosted Plant's career.  Attended the tour in Detroit - had fun.<BR>It was about the time that he began singing Zep songs on stage again - showing that he was loosening up.  &quot;Watching You&quot; is a nice track.  &quot;Hurting Kind&quot; and &quot;Tie Die on the Highway&quot; are fun and show Plant's style coming into his own.
6304140711|5.0|I really liked it a lot I watch it all the time its my fevrent of all I liked the end of it but the best part was wean they were on the ride and wean she stide him with his on peaces pip that was kool nothing can top fear in that way thats all
B000002I7R|4.0|After the traumatic breakup of Led Zep, Plant's first foray was probably his best one yet 20 years on.  It has a kashmir like &quot;Slow Dancer&quot; and a bluesy &quot;Like I've Never Been Gone&quot; - zep fans will probably be a wee bit nostalgic.  This was the closest thing to the zep sound that Plant would ever get before forging on with his own style.
B00005NZBN|3.0|I'd expected more from this album. Not that it's bad, in any sense of the word. Two tracks are absolutely amazing: &quot;High Water (for Charlie Patton)&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot;, the latter almost a &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; outtake in terms of sound. And &quot;High Water&quot; is every bit the equal of &quot;Blind Willie McTell.&quot; His band is excellent, and Lanois' production is tight without being poppy. The drawbacks: first, Bob's voice is getting very shot, and his diction is making it hard to pick out a lot of lyrics. Second, he's indulged in some schmaltzy, Hoagie Carmichael-ish songs here that just don't work (for me). They remind me of the &quot;Self Portrait&quot; album, to be honest. It's not just the 'feel' of the songs -- I can deal with that -- it's the banality of the lyrics, and the poor rhyming and meter of them, too. So, two or three duds, two classics, and a bunch of regular material that will 'grow on you', if you give it a chance.
B000000OYQ|3.0|Outrider was disappointing, and preceded the re-release of the Led Zep masters.  The story goes that Jimmy Page's master tapes for a double or triple album were stolen from his home - leading him to recompose this effort.  The basic idea of doing three styles - hard rock, instrumental and blues are here - and the blues numbers are the best.  But the guitar work is strangely bland.  As one reviewer puts it, this is an uneven work.  Plant's improvised &quot;The Only One&quot; doesn't do anything and John Miles - the vocalist - would do a far better job singing live on tour with Page.  The album also sounds too clean.  No grit whatsoever.  I rate this 2 and a half stars....
B00005OAIE|5.0|The new cd by John mayer is just one of those rare cds that you can listen from the first track to the last track. The first track no such thing is my personal favorite off the cd it is a fresh taste of upbeat music. On this cd the variety of sound you hear does not get tiresome, each song is unique from the other one. The Lyrics!! written by john mayer paint a picture you dont get from many artist around today he is truly a gifted writer, the songs are just as honest as they can be. <BR>IF you are thinking about buying this cd don't hesitate you will without a doubt like this acoustic,electric,jazzy,and rock of an album. This is great cd to listen to in the car with the windows down and just let the mind wander but stay focused on the road.<BR>Hope you enjoy!
B00000G3PL|4.0|Let's face it, Danny Glover and Mel Gibson have undertaken more serious acting roles then Murtaugh (Glover) and Riggs (Gibson), but probably not any that were more fun. Lethal Weapon is typical of the buddy cop movies and follows the developing relationship of Murtaugh, who is just celebrating his 50th birthday and Riggs, who is suicidal over the recent death of his wife, as well as their attempt to bring down a large drug smuggling operation. Both Glover and Gibson do an excellent job bringing raw emotion into what could have been merely a smash-up action movie.<br />Lethal Weapon 2 introduces a hysterical Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, a witness who Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect. Though the premise is the same as LW1, Murtaugh and Riggs going after the bad man, Pesci adds freshness and humor. Watch for the scene where Riggs discusses the death of his wife, powerful with an outstanding supporting performance by Darlene Love.<br />In Lethal Weapon 3, Pesci returns as Getz, and Lorna Cole, played by Rene Russo, is introduced as an internal affairs officer. In this outing, Murtaugh and Riggs, along with Cole, are after a cop turned bad. Lots of fun and good acting and noteworthy performances by the supporting cast particularly Damon Hines as Nick Murtaugh.<br />Chris Rock steps up as the new face in Lethal Weapon 4 which finds Lorna Cole and an unmarried Rianne Murtaugh (much to her father's dismay) both pregnant. Jet Li has an excellent turn as the villian in this outing. The perfect mix of martial arts action and comedy.<br />I enjoyed them all
B00005IC2H|1.0|The guy I work with plays this constantly.  It sounds like whale song.  Worse, whales with gas.<br />Next time he steps away from his computer, I'm going to delete these songs from his hard drive.  I think I know where he keeps the CD...
B000002O3I|4.0|The material is great even though the sound quality couldn't match todays studio sound. This is some seriously creative guitar playing by Sumlin and a few others including willie johnson. Wolf as always is unmatchable. Nobody ever has compared to him. However there is one missing track which they mention. They basically said that of the 25 songs from both albums 24 were there because they couldn't fit the other one. Keep in mind all are under 4 minutes and most are under three. I've seen more material on a disc before, who are they kidding? But aside from this false advertising all I can say is that this really is a big slice of blues history. Most of it is gritty but just the same alot of it is fun too. Wolf always had a sly sense of humor in his songs. Backdoor Man in particular is such a blues classic. Also not just Hubert sumlin Willie johnson and an otis spann accompaniment but Willie Dixon's history is written out and even played in here too. Wolf is one of the most natural bluesman there ever was and nobody will ever fill his big ole shoes either. If that one missing track [ can't tell you what it is cuz I don't know ] doesn't bother you then you can't go wrong here. Great songs from a great bunch of blues players.
6300263673|5.0|Dirty Dancing is one of my all time favorite movies. The movie is about a bad boy named Johnny that is a dance instrucot at a resort. His dance parter, Penny, is pregnant and won't be able to perform their mombo act at another motel. There is a customer at the resort, named Baby, that is willing to learn the dance. While Johnny is teaching Baby the dance they fall in love. The night of the performance goes fairly well but while they are gone Penny gets into trouble. Baby goes and gets her father to help because he is a doctor. He helps Penny, but he told Baby to stay away from Johnny and Penny. Baby does not listen. Her and Johnny sneak around so that no one finds out about them. One day Johnny gets mad because Baby won't tell her father about them. Johnny is accused of stealing and Baby then sticks up for him so he won't be fired. He is fired anyways. Baby's dad gets really mad because she didn't listen to him. There is a show to end the season that Johnny was supposed to dance for. Instead the whole staff sings a song. Johnny then shows up and says te best line of the movie, &quot;No one puts Baby in a corner.&quot; They then go and perform a dance and her dad realizes that he is not such a bad guy after all. He apologizes and tells Baby how wonderful she looked. I liked this movie because it is a love story. The dancing and music also adds a lot to it. Once you watch this movie you will fall in love with it.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I have only played this CD once so far and it knocked me out.  I am a longtime Dylan fan but was somewhat underwhelmed by Time out of Mind.  TOOM was brilliant, but too dark, brooding and lost in Daniel Lanois' trademark murky reverb to play very often.  It also sounded slapped together musically, as if Dylan gathered a group of musicians who never played together before to run through songs they had never heard and released all the first takes (this may have acutally happened!)  In contrast, this is a tight working band with only Augie Meyers sitting in, and they sound like one.  The sound and production are clear, gimmick-free and very listenable.  The material is much lighter in subject, at least on the surface, than that on the mortality-obsessed TOOM, but still full of the old Dylan vitriol.  And the lyrics - man, Bob hasn't sounded so much like Bob in decades!  Witty, allusion-packed, alternately loopy and dead serious, I predict that these songs will stack up well to his most legendary material. Much has been made of Dylan's foray into semi-jazzy, semi-swing old fashioned pop stylings on this CD.  To me those songs recall neo-traditionalists like Dan Hicks, Asleep at the Wheel and the Squirrel Nut Zippers.  I remember when Dylan toured with the Grateful Dead that Bob Weir was astounded that Dylan was teaching them chord changes they didn't know.  Now I can see why. Despite the well-deserved Grammies for TOOM, L&amp;T will be in regular rotation my CD player for a long time.
0446608955|5.0|This book was truly one of my favorites.I am now reading another book by Nicholas Sparks and I think he is a great author. His books are filled with compassion and are very enjoyable...I recommend it!
B00005N9CV|3.0|By the time of her previous album (&quot;When I look in your eyes&quot;) it was apparent that DK had found her style. Romantic, intimate, lounge atmosphere music with strings background ... which is nice if you are in the mood for a rest and relax. DK is strong enough to maintain your attention so her music doesn't fall into the background. Still, her style and records easily become constricting and too soothing. It doesn't challenge you. This album is not too far away to be called a sequel from her previous ones. I saw her recently in a concert, where the dress code was tie and jacket, and we sat nicely 'admiring' the music, clapped quietly. Playing live, DK had more fun and took chances, which was not visible in the record. I hope she takes more 'risk' in the next album.<BR>ps. under Tommy LiPuma production are we going to see a duet between DK and George Benson? Hmm..
052594527X|5.0|Girl With A Pearl Earring<BR>        The book Girl With a Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier, is an insightful look into the life of the protagonist Griet. Griet is a young woman living in Holland with her caring but manipulative mother, blinded father, and young enthusiastic sister. Out of the blue, her mother informs her that she is to leave to work for the painter Vermeer and his household in order to make ends meet for her family. Reluctantly, she packs her few possessions and heads off to the other side of town, where her life will be completely different. First of all, her new house is in the Catholic section of town; having grown up a Protestant, she feels very out of place. Secondly, she knows no one there and is treated poorly by almost everyone she meets.<BR>     As she masterfully works cleaning Master Vermeer's studio and running errands for his mother in law, the old widow Maria Thins, she finds how difficult her place in life is. Half the days Vermeer is kindly and affectionate towards her while other days he is distant and cold. Griet, amidst all her troubles, finds herself falling for Pieter, the butcher's charming son. Although  she and her master clearly have feelings for each other they are kept apart by their class differences. This makes things even more complicated for the young Griet. She must worry about was is best for her family and herself, although she does not have much of a say as a young woman in seventeenth-century Holland. Tracy Chevalier manages to really get inside Griet's head while keeping the reader thoroughly enthralled. <BR>       This book was by far one of the best I have read and I highly recommend it. One reason this book is so wonderful is because the reader gets to know Griet so well that they feel as though they are right there with her. The reader can truly understand and relate to many of the feelings she confronts. Although Girl With a Pearl Earring takes place in the seventeenth century, her problems are not unlike the ones many young women face today. It is often hard to tell where one fits in, especially in a group that is foreign to you. Being able to feel for the protagonist made a big difference in how read the book and it kept me turning pages late into the night. Another reason I found this book interesting was because the characters were so deep. At the beginning you are introduced to the major characters but as the story progresses more is revealed about their personalities and you are able to sympathize with even Griet's antagonists. For example Tanneke, the other household maid, is often cross and bitter towards Griet. However, you learn that although she may not be so sympathetic to Griet she is a good person at heart and is not set out just to make Griet unhappy (as one may assume at first). This book was fascinating for me because of deepness behind Griet and her acquaintances. <BR>       Although I greatly enjoyed reading Girl With a Pearl Earring, I understand that others may not because they do not know what it's like to be a fourteen-year-old girl. Although the protagonist is a girl and many of the issues she deals with are due to her gender (especially at that particular period of history) it is not a legitimate reason not to read the book just because you are not or never were a young woman. There is much more behind the story that boys can appreciate too. Although they may not be able to sympathize with Griet's issues it does not mean that they can not get an idea of what it feels like to be her, and enjoy it while they are at it. This is great book for anybody to read and be able to get an amazing sense of seventeenth-century Holland.
B00005MNP8|5.0|This new reissue of Blondie's biggest selling release is a dream come true for us Blondie fans.  The remastered sound is amazing compared to the previous domestic release.  However, they should've kept the original version of &quot;Heart Of Glass&quot; as heard on the LP, and add the longer Disco Version as a bonus track.    Every track in &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; is amazing, even the ones that did not make it as singles.

6302662648|2.0|Sneakers is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite movies. However, this DVD has some serious problems if you intend to view it on a PC DVD-ROM drive. A file allocation error renders the first half of the movie unreadable to most PC DVD drives (precise technical details are widely availible on the internet). This is not a problem for most standalone players. So if you're like me and use your PC as your DVD player, I'd suggest looking into the VHS edition.
0792844890|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 5 and I never got tired of watching it.  In my opinion, this is Mel Brooks' best movie! It parodies sci-fi greats from Star Wars to Star Trek and much, much more.  One of the best parts is the part with ludicrous speed.  Don't get me wrong.  I love '&quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; and &quot;History of the World Part 1&quot;, too but this doles out more laughs.  Unlike BS and HOTWPO, this is rated PG so gather some friends or family around and watch this hilarious sci-fi parody!  WHAT YOU GOT IS WHAT WE NEED AND ALL WE DO IS DIRTY DEEDS, WE'RE THE SPACEBALLS!!!!!!!!!  WATCH OUT, CUZ WE'RE THE SPACEBALLS!!!!!!!!!!
B00005N9CV|3.0|Supple and sexy voice, but where is the nuanced rhythm and arrangement in &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot;? This accompaniment is predictable and uninteresting in comparison. You should never buy the best first!
0553573403|2.0|I love epic fantasy. After reading the intro chapter online, i was all excited about finding a new author. Martin's writing skills looked promising: the slaughter of the night watch by those weird undead things was very evocative, chilling. not many writers can bring you 'into the moment' like that.<br />Where did that skill go? I have not been 'in the moment' since that intro. After diligently pushing through the first half of 'Game of Thrones,' I'm giving up. I have tried very hard to like this book, but despite the richness of the world he has created, i just can't seem to care about the characters or what they are doing. I don't think any of them are three-dimensional at all. you could sum each one up with a single phrase. In short, they are entirely predictable.<br />Some of the reviewers have given Martin 'kudos' for creating characters that are more 'real' than your usual all-powerful hero, struggling with his prophecied destiny. OK, maybe he deserves credit for trying to make them more realistic, but he has not made them 'real.' They don't get under my skin at all. I can't imagine crying for the tradgedies they experience; I'm just not convinced.<br />I kept thinking the story would get interesting, that the characters would grow, but from the reviews for the next book, looks like it's just 'same stuff, later on.'
B000050FEN|5.0|Two detectives, one on the verge of retiring, and one a hot head, have teamed up to track down a sadistic, and tireless serial killer. Every twist and turn more gory and vicious than the last.  The really creepy thing about this whole movie is that there are men like Spacey out here in this world, and the sad thing about it is that we don't know who they are until they are caught.  Seven was a non-stop thrill ride!!  Every second more intense than the last.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have been a long time 311 fan, but I'm afraid Linkin Park may top them!  If you like what you've heard on the radio like Crawling, or One Step Closer (which I find annoying from being overplayed), you will definitly love the cd.  I hate cds with filler crap, but this cd has none.  BUY IT NOW
B00003CXA2|4.0|For me, Forrest Gump is one of the best movies ever. I waited a lot to see it published on DVD, and I bought it as soon as Amazon put it on sale. I must say I was dissapointed to find there were no spanish subtitles in this \\"collector edition\\". I´ve been through many other titles in \\"zone 1\\" encoding, but none of them lack spanish subtitles. Why did it happen this time?<br />Despite this sad detail, the DVD is wonderful.
B00003CXFV|3.0|This is another stereotypical Julia Roberts film, where she is an outcast or not accepted by society, and in this case that is because she is a single mother of three children, who starts off jobless. She eventually weasles her way into a job at a law firm collecting information. Then like a stereotypical Julia movie she capture's everyone's attention (with her body and charm) while staying on track with her goal of one day becoming famous... and helping her own situation. The situation in this movie is that while working for the law firm she stumbles upon a huge problem caused by a company dumping chemicals into a town's water supply which has been making everyone seriously ill for years. Anyway we all know how it ends, she busts the badguys, gets popularity and fame... The reason as to why this movie won an oscar is not because of Julia's great acting, but rather, because this movie tugged at your heart hearing the stories of those ill from the water contamination.
B000002J2D|4.0|This was the first album released by Genesis after the departure of lead guitarist Steve Hackett. As such, it is almost as much of a milestone in Genesis history as &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;. Steve's departure was not seen as a &quot;death knell&quot; by the press and most of their fans, as Peter Gabriel's was. I think a lot of the reason for this is the fact that Genesis, by this point, had proved that every single member of the band was a virtuoso in his own right, and thus could survive the loss of another member.<br />Don't get me wrong - losing Steve made a huge impact on the Genesis sound. But, Mike Rutherford showed that he could step up from his bass guitar playing and take over the lead just fine, thanks. Mike's guitar has a much more modern, metallic feel to it than Steve's expansive, flowing sound. This change pretty much had the effect of severing Genesis' music from everything they had done before. The change in their sound was so drastic that it's hard to imagine the &quot;trio&quot; Genesis ever going back and doing anything like &quot;One For The Vine&quot; or &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;, though they did not lose touch entirely with their progressive roots.<br />This album is also a milestone in that is the first Genesis album that does not contain any long, flowing instrumental sections that had been one of the best things about their music. Instead, they chose to go with a lot of shorter, radio-friendly songs. One of these songs, the excellent &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; became Genesis' first big hit single. In addition to this classic track, some other highlights of the album include &quot;Burning Rope&quot;, &quot;Down and Out&quot;, &quot;Deep in the Motherlode&quot;, and &quot;Scenes from a Night's Dream&quot;, which is an interesting blend of progressive and pop music.<br />This album is rightly seen as the birth of the modern Genesis. While it's not my favorite Genesis album, it does contain several gem songs. If you're interestedin intelligent, well-written music, this album (like the rest of the Genesis catalogue) is a must-have.
B000002ORU|5.0|A must for all fans of rock music especially the followers of classic and psychedellic rock. This is indeed a good value for money.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Put aside everything you know about DM, and start fresh. This seems to be the common start point with every new release from these guys, this is no different.<BR>Once again DM prove they can re-invent their sound, with the occasional head nod of recognition to where they've come from.<BR>The brilliant &quot;Dream On&quot;, starts the album with its accoustic guitar riff, from this point on, you know this is going to be a newer sounding DM, and it is.<BR>&quot;Shine&quot; &amp; &quot;The Sweetest Condition&quot; is classic DM, beautifully crafted, and both could have come off numerous past DM albums. These tracks are definate hightlights.<BR>&quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; slows the album down a little, it's quite fragile, and gentle, and throws you into a dream type state, spilling its way into &quot;The Dead Of Night&quot;, which sticks out like a sore thumb. Although great to hear they are willing to cover new ground, this is not a great example of their daring.<BR>&quot;Love Theme&quot; the first of the instrumentals is brief, but sits well.<BR>&quot;Freelove&quot; returns to where &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; left off. Martins' song writing as you can hear, has taken a huge step forward in both depth, and direction.<BR>&quot;Comatose&quot; is once again classic DM, with Martin taking lead vocals.<BR>&quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is a great track, although, almost outta place on this fairly slow paced album. A welcome uptempo change that wants you to sit up, and re-think, what you think about &quot;Exciter&quot;.<BR>&quot;Breathe&quot; &amp; &quot;Easy Tiger&quot; seem to glide past without much fanfare, although good tracks, not the best this album has to offer.<BR>&quot;I Am You&quot; &amp; &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; ends the album on a definte high. Both these tracks show where DM are going, and how far they have come. The depth of the song writing shines most throughout these tracks.<BR>All in all, a good album. If your buying this expecting pop songs thatget you humming in the car, DONT. This CD demands investing your time in listening to its delicate journey. Well done Depeche.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I have to admit that this album didn't strike me as that impressive on my first listen. I've been a big hip-hop fan for years and I was expecting big, brash beats and loud boasting. I certainly didn't come to this album looking for depth. After a few listens, &quot;Miseducation&quot; began to blow me away. Musically, it's incredibly intricate and diverse. But lyrically, it is astounding. The album feels like it was made with such love and conviction, such strength. &quot;To Zion&quot; may be one of the best love songs I've ever heard. I could go on and on. Mainly, I just feel really lucky to have this album.
0767836286|4.0|ARLINGTON ROAD is fantastic. Fast paced, great acting, good direction, unexpected ending (without being silly), a moral plot, good premise. Bridges and Robbins are both outstanding here. I felt suffocated watching the plot develop to a no winner situation. Amazing.
B00005N9CV|4.0|The title of this review may be misleading...but allow me to elaborate.<br />Diana is a brilliant pianist.  Her vocals are without a doubt, the singular light in a dark tunnel of modern-day jazz (torch) singers, and put simply, there's no one like her.  She's got it all, and that's all there is to it. <br />So, when I say that this is an album 'featuring' Diana Krall, what I mean is that this feels like one of those mid-60s elevator records that were released at a period when jazz was near death, and the only way to sell an album was to say, &quot;The Carmel Strings, Featuring...etc.etc.&quot;<br />The string arrangements are not brilliant. Lush?  Yes.  Too 'soft &amp; light'?  Absolutely.  And frankly, most of it over-shadows her ability to shine.  She's a player, man...don't cover it up.<br />And while we're on the topic of saccharine, allow me to add that again, Diana's performance is magic.  Call her 'Queen Midas', because no matter what she touches turns to gold...<br />I just wish they would have let her do it 'her' way...<br />Perhaps it was the label switch?  Band members changing?  I don't know.  Honestly, it's too much &quot;sweet, light latin rhythm&quot; (as mentioned in the above review) and not enough real-deal. <br />If you love Diana's voice (and who doesn't) it's still a worthy purchase.  But, if you're looking to be swept away in the magic that was &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; or &quot;Love Scenes&quot;...well, you may have to harken back, or wait for the next one.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is just simply a great rock CD by a great rock band!  Admittedly I am a really big fan and the CD sounds similar to &quot;The State,&quot; but that does not stop this from being one of the best CD's I've heard this year.  As much as I liked these guys on CD, I became an even bigger fan after seeing them live.  They are MUCH better live.  The songs take on a whole new level of energy and if they come to your town you will not be disappointed!
B00001QEE8|5.0|Rudyard Kipling's &quot;The Jungle Books&quot; are the basis for this fun, animated trip through the jungles of India.  Mowgli, a human orphan, is reared by a pack of wolves (his parents are Akela and Raksha).  When the wolf pack votes to send the &quot;man cub&quot; away, he is taken in by a friendly bear called Baloo (voice by Phil Silvers) and a pantheer named Bagheera (voice by Sebastian Cabot).  Many adventures ensue, including a run-in with monkeys and their king (voice by Louis Prima) and a quartet of mop-top vultures, as Mowgli and his friends try to avoid Shere Khan, the tiger.  The music in this film is particularly good, with such excellent Richard &amp; Robert Sherman compositions as &quot;Bear Necessities&quot; and &quot;I Want To Be Like You.&quot;  Very small children might find this movie a bit frightening ... but others will love it.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Okay, so number 1 was incredible.  Blew me away.  (Seemed) nothing could top it.  Then came \\"The Lost World,\\" which- well- wasn't very good.  OK.  But then comes \\"JP3.\\"  After #2, I was reluctant to even see it, but I am SO glad I did.  JP3 has more dinos, more action, and more blood than 1 & 2 combined.  Here's a warning though: 1 & 2 were kiddie-geared movies, violence was kept as limited as possible.  This one is gorey and has some language.  An \\"R\\" rating would really fit it better.  Heed the PG-13 rating.
B000002U9Y|4.0|This is one of my favorite PF records.  Along with Piper this record shines.  Its a bit different than Piper but it was probably the bands' maturing.  The opener &quot;Let there be more light&quot; is brilliant.  David Gilmour showing what he is capabale of and why is where he is.  The song remember a day flows right along.  perfectly.  A good work by Rick Wright.  Then &quot;Set the controls..&quot;.  By the time you reach the title track you are very pleased at the disc you just bought.  And the ender Jugband B's is a perfect way to cap the disc.
B0000024K1|3.0|It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back is a good rap cd, but not a great one. When I bought this disc i was excited, thousands of people told me it was the greatest rap cd ever made. I listened to it and found myself bored out of my mind. Its good- lyrically, and the beats are good but it is not the best rap cd ever made. I couldn't wait till the cd was over. if there was more of teminator x and chuck d id give it a five but flava flav is very annoying, every track he says &quot;BOYYYEEE&quot;. good cd but overrated.
B000005YZM|4.0|I after listening to the album a few times I would describe it as the Beatles covering Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, using the recording techniques of Sgt. Pepper. Though influenced by Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper, this album definitely has its own feel. This album is laced with mellotron, which also give it more of a Beatles feel. The remastering job is excellent, it's nice that the stereo and mono versions are included. The first song &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; blew me away, I think it is far better than &quot;Time of the Season&quot;. The rollicking piano and snappy drums set the tone for the album. I probably wouldn't place this album artisticly along side Pepper or Pet Sounds, but is an equal to Kinks Village Green Preservation Society, Small Faces Nut Gone Flakes, Pink Floyd Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and The Who Sell Out. Typical 60's british, and consistantly good.
078401213X|4.0|There are many things to love about this movie - an intense examination of the struggle with madness -or is it genius?  A dark, disturbing look at a not-quite-real world, filled with people who somehow know of the quest to find order in chaos.  A brilliant depiction of a black and white, strange world.<br />Overall, a pleasant movie that intrigues, but never quite fulfills the promise of a truly unique world.  The point to it all?  Perhaps the self-induced torture of a man not quite up to discovering the numerical secret of the universe.
630349255X|4.0|This Video is a beautiful visual experience of the joys and sometimes pain of being a human being on this incredible planet. It is a visual feast, and from a design standpoint, very well done. Many cultures from all over the world have been filmed-natural events, indescribable scenery, and a poignant look at the human condition are all portrayed with remarkable beauty.
B000009QO6|5.0|I bought this album way back in 1988 when it was orginally released. Fourteen years later I still find myself coming back to this album and enjoying it as if it was new.  Danzig is the Dark God of Metal.  All the songs on the album are great.  A must have for anyone who is a serious listener to the genre.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Bjork's ability to at once respect and transform the conventions of musical theater goes back to her croon-and-scream rendition of &quot;It's Oh So Quiet,&quot; the big-band showstopper on her 1995 album, Post. So it makes sense that she stars in Dancer in the Dark, Lars von Trier's prizewinner at this year's Cannes Film Festival, about a Czech immigrant who in 1964 escapes the tedium of her factory job by imagining that she lives in a Hollywood movie musical. Bjork also supplies the film's soundtrack, an appropriate marriage of industrial clanging and symphonic melodrama. Bjork explored that same mix on her 1997 release, Homogenic. But here the clatter seems whimsical and friendly, like the fancy footwork of Gene Kelly. On &quot;In the Musicals,&quot; orchestral strings swirl around shuffling beats that simultaneously suggest tap dancing and assembly-line rattle. &quot;You were always there to catch me,&quot; she sings, not only describing an imaginary lover-dancer but also the bittersweet escape of music, the score of her daydreams. It is a powerful analogy, and this album, although short, represents a particularly accessible career highlight for Bjork. The clincher is the ballad &quot;I've Seen It All,&quot; a duet with Radiohead's Thom Yorke about blindness and resignation that is so West Side Story in its Technicolor soul it could make Stephen Sondheim cry. And probably you, too.
6305265488|5.0|'Ever After' is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen!  The traditional Cinderella story was modified a bit, all the while adding entertaining side stories, wit, humor, and beauty.  Drew Barrymore shines in her finest performance ever!  The scenery and sets are so elegant and mystical, they make you really feel like you are there.  The story is so delicate and beautiful, it's really a masterpiece.  I was also very impressed with Anjelica Houston and Dougary Scott, three cheers for them!<br />'Ever After' is a charming adaptation of the classsic Cinderella story, a must see.
B0000029DD|5.0|There are few albums which will provoke you in the manner Buckley will in Grace. His vocals are sweet, sentimental and evoke a certian purity and innocence- even when he asks his love to &quot;let me sleep on your couch.&quot; The real pearl in this collection is the cover of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah.&quot; When you hear Buckley sing &quot;It's not a cry that you hear at night; It's not somebody who's seen the light; It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah&quot; you're just gonna die.<BR>It's a tragedy that this young singer/songwriter left us with only a glimpse of his talents. He did, however, give us one heckova gift in &quot;Grace.&quot;
B00005B1EX|5.0|Anyone who knows anything about heavy metal, knows that the vocals of Rob Halford are a force to be reckoned with and have been so for 30 years. This CD let`s you know why Halford is called the METAL GOD! High notes, low notes, screams, growls, Rob  pulls everything off with blazing intensity. Makes me shiver just thinking about it....This CD is, however, not only a display of Robs breathtaking vocals but an unweiling ( granted, not their first recording together but I think the band sounds even more intense on this album than on &quot;Resurrection&quot; ) of a band that is guaranteed to blow your head off once you push play and crank up the volume! The Lachman/Chlasciak-duo is like Tipton/Downing with much improved sound and by improved I mean heavier. Riendeau on bass does a good job keeping up with the sheer virtuosity of the drummer, Bobby Jarzombek. Just listen to his fills and double bass and youll know what I mean. If you know of any better heavy-metal drumwork than the stuff you hear on this CD, let me know!<BR>Live Insurrection Highlights:<BR>&quot;Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Into the pit&quot;, &quot;Light comes out of black&quot;, &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;, &quot;Hells last survivor&quot;, &quot;Silent Screams&quot;, &quot;Metal Gods&quot;, &quot;Heart of a lion&quot;<BR>Finally, Id like to say that HALFORD IS BACK.....AND THEN SOME.
0449227421|4.0|Ken Follett definately gets ahold of the American legal system in this one - I was quite suprised. Not one of my favorite Follett books, but interesting and informative. Liked learning about DNA and unique research techniques.
B00005N9CV|5.0|AS USUAL AFTER LISTENING TO HER SONGS YOU ONLY WANT MORE.... THIS IS A GREAT CD AND A GREAT SOOTHING CD ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES.... THANK YOU DIANA AND PLEASE COME OUT WITH MORE
B00003CXSP|3.0|I read Hannibal as soon as I could get a copy of it!! I loved every minute very page!! Then word comes of a film version!! OMG!! I am psyched!!!! Then, YAYYYYYYYY, it comes out!! I run to the movie and grab a seat!! I sit through the first hour and a half, entranced with the beautiful cinematography and the compelling story....then.... disaster strikes!! ( Spoiler Ahead ) When the agent's head was cut off people began to laugh, not only did the actor act funny, the effect looked cartoonish! It ruined the movie! Plus the ending was a tad different from the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|The character development is non-existant. The acting was okay to wooden. The dialogue is awful. &quot;First you went away, then we thought you were dead, then all of this happened [referring to the attack on Pearl Harbor]...&quot;<br />The story is inane. You can tell exactly what turns the plot is going to take at any time. You can probably guess almost all of the main plot points from the very beginning. It's a throw back to the old Saturday afternoon war movies, where one guy fights the war all on his own. Ben Affleck joins the British Eagle squadron (made up of Americans who went in as civilians and formally joined the RAF, but still manages to stay in the US Army); he is shot down, and taken to occupied France; somehow gets back to England, over to America, and out to Pearl Harbor before any word of being alive makes it there; he arrives the day before the raid; he is one of two pilots in his old squadron to take off during the raid; he and his best friend shoot down 7 Japanese aircraft; and then he gets recruited to fly B25s for Jimmy Doolittle.<br />The first 90 minutes is a romance. Guy goes to war, is missing in action, best friend takes care of the girl when they think he's dead... well, you can guess where THIS is going.<br />The combat footage isn't bad, except for the comic book dogfights, but the Pearl Harbor raid takes up only 35 minutes of the movie. Wrapping it up with the Doolittle raid would have been an intelligent choice if they didn't have the fighter pilots act as the crew of a couple of the bombers. If I was a B25 bomber vet, I'd have been insulted.<br />One day someone will trim this turkey down to its battle scenes and post it on the web. Wait for that to happen. It's certainly not worth sitting through the full 3 hours to see good CGI used badly.
B0000039PW|5.0|Probably the best pure rap CD of all time.  Biggie's genius was that although there's plenty of gangster tough talk on here, Biggie's overall complex personality shines through.  One man's desires, insecurities, pain (even depression), flights of ego and humor are present throughout and give the listener an intimacy with the artist well in excess of what can be found on other cd's, rap and non-rap alike.  I especially love listening to this CD when I'm driving because there's an overall motown feel to the music that I associate with cruising.
B00005N83M|4.0|I actually don't like most pop but I there some songs on this album i like although i mostly love rock/punk. i only gave 4 stars though because of the cussing and junk songs. When this album first came out, they didn't have the warning and I downloaded the song &quot;Play&quot;. Well, I found out the word that she said and I just didn't listen to any of the other songs. Anyway, without the cussing, I would probably give this album 4 stars because some songs are good. I like, Walking on Sunshine, Play ( clean version), I'm real original and remix and more. However I recommend that only adults buy this version and buy the clean one for their kids. Enjoy!:)
0930289455|4.0|The team of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon, who combined to hit a grand slam with the now seminal graphic novel, Watchman, regrouped shortly after that and produced this examination of Batman.  It's shorter, but that's the only real negative here.  Moore's take on the Joker emphasizes the cruel nature of the character, and he includes a plot development here, which some of the other reviewers give away but I can't let myself do, that is shocking in how it affects characters.<br />When I glance at a page of Gibbon art, I'm never that interested in it.  It lacks the flash and smoothness of fan-favorites like McFarlane.  But it is art that works in conjunction with the text to truly propel the story, and that's what a graphic work is supposed to do.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is truely a great album and could definitely be placed up there with Powerslave and Seventh Son. Bruce Dickinson is again screaming better than ever with the same intensity. Ghost of Navigator has to be my favorite followed by Mercenary, WickerMan and Nomad. The 3 guitar combo really rocks and does provide for a lot of headbanging...Adrian Smith and Dave Murray are always good and Janick Jers definitely doesn't make it a crowd. Hope they come out with more of the same. Rock on..
B00003CXV4|5.0|Reading some of the other reviews, I've felt little more than frustration that there are so many people in this world that would write off a movie that has such obvious real-life implications and such a deep look into the human condition so easily.  I'll tell you what I saw when I watched it.<br />After the first few minutes of the movie I thought I was going to sit through another movie knowing everything that was going to happen, but I was pleasantly surprised with the introduction of Sara (Charlize Theron).  From that point on, there seemed to be something more going on behind the scenes.  There were a number of points in the movie that I connected with personally, especially when Nelson was going to leave and Sara tells him that he'll go home, turn on his TV, get bored... turn on his computer, get bored... surf the web, get bored... then think of her.  I do that nearly every night, and the only thing that distracts me is working, which I do a great deal.<br />In any case, this isn't about me.  I just wanted to put my opinion in.  I think this was a very deep and realistic movie that deserves a little more than one star, even if it is simply for the effort.  Hope this helps! :)
B00000JAXT|4.0|You know, reading the other reviews on this particular album I see a lot of truth to some of the opinions but I do think it is greatly unfair to review this album by comparing it to Wyatt's early works with the Softs. It needs to be placed on time and space and see what were the conditions surrounding its recording. I am not trying to propose a psicological research on the album, I'm only suggesting that Robert's state of mind and mood at the time greatly influence Matching Mole's work on this album; after all he was well know for just letting his feelings aboard his writting and performing abilities (just check Rock Bottom for example; a deeply melancolic and self exploratory album which was his first recording after the accident. Or maybe End of an Ear; a very avant garde project almost satirical about his life as a rock star just by the time he got fed up with the Soft Machine and was &quot;unemployed&quot;).<BR>I really beleive that at that time Robert was desperatly trying to run away from the Soft Machine psychedelic-heyday-rock star stigma and just be himself, a virtuoso drummer and great composer (not to mention his ability for manipulating his own voice).Robert was just being Robert.<BR>Of course we cannot take away credit for the great job the rest of the band did. Matching Mole is a great example of a no-barrier Progressive Rock band that, on their short career, experimented with sounds as far as they could get without thinking about mainstream consecuences.<BR>After all, who could not be thrilled with the opening words from Robert at the begining of track #2;<BR>IT'S BROWN, LIVES UNDERGROUND, MIOPIC.....IT'S THE MOLE!
B000000OMJ|4.0|If this was an album by NSync I'd be very impressed.  But this is  Peter Gabriel, the genius behind Genesis.  The man who wrote the &quot;The return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; and probably the jist of the material on &quot;SElling England by the Pound&quot;.  So when I heard Peter GAbreil (3) i was a little dissapointed.  He displays good lyrical content but i found the music to be dry and less than amazing.  I like the songs &quot;Game without Frontiers&quot;, &quot;No Self Control&quot;, &quot;Biko&quot;, and &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; but it wasn't the same type of liking as you do with his Genesis songs.  The type of liking where you say to yourself, &quot;Now i got to get all his cd's&quot;.  I think this album is worth hearing  never the less, but it won't be an &quot;experience&quot;, just a plesant day in the park.
B000050XEI|5.0|If you don't own this disc yet, you'd better get it while you can. This album will be harder to find than an American flag at WalMart before long.  &quot;Only Time&quot; captures the mood of our wounded nation in this uncertain period. It's been used repeatedly by the TV networks in their coverage of the WTC disaster. To add to it's momentum, &quot;Only Time&quot; is also featured on at least one movie soundtrack and on the &quot;Friends&quot; TV series promos. Like all of Enya's albums, nearly every track is splendid. The entire album is excellent, but &quot;Only Time&quot; is a classic in the truest sense of the word. When we look back on this year and the war that began in it, this song will come to mind as surely as &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; (Bette Midler) and &quot;Show Me The Way&quot; (Styx) do when we think of the Gulf War.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Hannibal, the sequel to Manhunter and The Silence Of The Lambs, is by far the most disapointing movie ever. The ending was the worst part of the movie. I don't want to ruin it for you, but those who read the book will be disappointed. Now, don't get me wrong. I like Juilianne Moore. But, when you think of Clarice you think of Jodie Foster. It also ditches the psychological horror theme and goes for the more noir meets Italian Drama. It has a few wierd parts in it, but it was nothing like The Silence Of The Lambs. I suggest if you watched the first two, then you may want to rent the sequel. Othereise, save your money for the remake of The Red Dragon.
B000053V7Q|4.0|I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the picture was so crystal clear that it was like he had been flimed yesturday....it has a great song list....BUT....I actually sent it back because the bonus 15 tracks that where supposed to be extra footage where actually not included..and allot of the song that where in the supposed bonus footage are teh songs that I like most....it was a real shame that they missed out the bonus footage as it would of made an excellent addition to your collection...also one thing that really annoyed me was that It came in one of those cheap card board covers, instead of the standard plastic sleve covers, which is really annoying as it easly gets wrecked and torn...in conclusion I would probably wait till they re-release it with the bonus footage!!

0767903862|5.0|Born and raised in Iowa, Bill Bryson spent 20 years in England before moving back to the United States to live in the perfect college town, Hanover, New Hampshire. A syndicated columnist, many of his columns about life in Hanover have been collected and published in \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself,\\" an enjoyable book, but because of the nature of its source material (syndicated columns) also a simple and highly sanitized one. At no point is the reader confronted by complex intellectual concepts or any obscenities.<br />\\"In a Sunburned Country\\" is a different matter. Written as an integrated book, it is a wonderful introduction to the more intellectually complex aspects of Australia, as well as the funnier ones, providing fascinating anthropological, botanical, geological, historical, political and sociological insights about our friends Down Under. Prior to reading it, I had dismissed Australia as being little more than a very dull version of America in the Fifties; Like Bryson, I now view it as the most fascinating place on earth. Similarly, I had viewed Mr. Bryson as being a male Erma Bombeck; I now view him as one of the more intelligent writers I have encountered.<br />The Australian Tourism Authority should consider licensing this book and either giving it away to prospective visitors or otherwise using it to promote the country. It is that good.
0790737345|1.0|Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are fine actors who have made excellent films, so why they jumped aboard this is anyones guess.  Meg Ryan is a doctor who loses a patient.  Cage is the angel that takes the soul away.  Ryan is beside herself with grief and anger, cage is puzzled at first by her reaction then as he visits more falls in love.<BR>It reminded me of the sort of film you would agree to go to on a first date.  Lots of people will say there is a deep profound hidden message about vulnerability, love and the human spirit, but I just wanted to be entertained.  PS  Bad ending also.
B000031XCR|3.0|This album is ok, but it just doesn't seem to stand out as well as all her other albums i have of her do... The other albums that stand out / that i have of her are, &quot;The Colour Of My Love&quot;, &quot;Falling Into You&quot;,&quot;S'il Suffisait D'Aimer&quot;, and &quot;The Collectors Series Volume One&quot;!I've had &quot;All The Way&quot; since Febuary when me and my grandma went on a trip, and she bought it for me...! When i first got it I really liked it but now &quot;All The Way&quot; Seems to be getting a bit boring... And plus I do not hardly listen to it anymore, plus the stupid CD skips on some of the songs..=(!So get this CD if you want, but it will get boring (sorta of) after awhile...!<BR>Ps, I'm not saying all of her albums get boring after awhile i'm just talking about &quot;All The Way&quot;!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|We saw John Mayer perform in New Oreleans in April and it was a great treat to see such a talented performer so new in his career! I'm happy to see he is now backed by a major label, since his cd really worth buying! He is a very talented songwriter, singer and musician. He's a unique mix of Dave Mathews, Sting and REM.
B000002UBU|5.0|Aside from the great title song, there are numerous other songs here that sound as good today as they did 30 years ago.  Today's artists could learn something from Crossroads - a great song with only Don's voice and a piano.  No gimmics just great lyrics, great music.  My other favorites are Winterwood and the roudy Everybody Loves Me Baby.  Vincent is a moving tribute to Van Gogh.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob Dylan's 43rd album starts out as just another good Dylan album, then kicks the door wide open into new territory. Here's how it plays out:<BR>The album opens with &quot;Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum,&quot; a typical straight-ahead opener about two interesting characters. From the very first track, you hear the first of many great Charlie Sexton guitar licks...and the rest of the band is up to the task as well. But I'm getting ahead of myself...<BR>&quot;Mississippi&quot; was originally intended for 'Time Out of Mind,' but Dylan and producer Daniel Lanois had a dispute about how the tune should be recorded, so Bob waited until now to put it on an album. It's being called an &quot;instant classic,&quot; and rightfully so. The song reveals another shade of Dylan, giving us another clue as to what it's like to be Bob Dylan. Near the end of the song, Dylan sings, &quot;Things should start to get interesting right about now.&quot; They sure do. &quot;Summer Days&quot; explodes as a swing/rockabilly/Elvis-like tune that does not disappoint in the least. From &quot;Summer Days&quot; on, you feel like you're listening to something very different from 'Time Out of Mind.' But Bob has more surprises...&quot;Bye and Bye&quot; comes across like an old Sinatra lounge-lizard tune, but it's a great departure and it works. The entire album has been called by some critics a tribute to American music. The album contains nods to the blues, country, folk, softshoe, rhythm &amp; blues, and of course rock n roll. A word or two about Dylan's band: This is the best performance by any of Dylan's bands since 'Blonde on Blonde' over 30 years ago. The group is top-notch and masterfully moves from one style to another. And what about Bob's voice? He's in his 60's now, after all...he's never sounded better. The amazing thing is that through all the very different styles on this album, Bob's voice works on every single track. I suspect that Dylan will keep us guessing about what he's up to nextall the way until he takes his last breath, which I hope won't be for a long, long time. Bob has constantly re-invented himself throughout his 40-year career, but for the past few years he has delivered two of his strongest albums. I think this one is stronger and better than 'Time Out of Mind.' A lot of people think Bob's best stuff is going on right now. They may be right. Explanation? &quot;I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.&quot;
B00005LQ04|5.0|The 3-disc special edition is a must.  Overall, a very slick, stylish package.  Excellent 1 hour doc, trailers, stills and booklet.  And the video and audio quality is mind-blowing.

B0000089FS|3.0|Reg Strikes Back, while pretty good, is not a great Elton John album. It's not a very consistent album. &quot;I Don't Want To Go On With You Like That&quot;, the first single, was a great, catchy, up-tempo song. It was a perfect Elton John song. The melody was insanely catchy and the lyrics were pretty cool. &quot;A Word In Spanish&quot; was a nice, airy, and enjoyable ballad. It is, however, nothing great or memorable. &quot;Since God Invented Girls&quot;, an obvious homage to Brian Wilson, is better and prettier. &quot;Goodbye Marlon Brando&quot; is a fun rocker, but not classic Elton rock. The lyrics were fun, but kind of stupid. &quot;Poor Cow&quot; has a catchy beat but it is an instantly forgettable song. &quot;Japanese Hands&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters(Part 2)&quot;, &quot;The Camera Never Lies&quot;, and &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; are the rest. A real mixed bag. It's not mediocre enough to get two stars, but three stars might be too much. Not bad. But not great. So much better stuff lay ahead of Elton and his fans.

It is as easy to get lost in the pages of this book  as it is to become lost in your own day dreams. Gaiman's characters are light, the adventures they share are magical, and in the end, everything works out as it should...  Anyone who wants to excape from the world of the mundane into the world of Fairie would do well to follow Tristran through the gap in the wall...and besides, sometimes we all need to chase falling stars.

THE LOOK OF LOVE, S'WONDERFUL, and MAYBE YOU'LL BE THERE are simply enchanting.<br />If I were a songwriter, I'd want Diana Krall to put her own special touch on all my work.<br />Enjoy!
6305508550|5.0|After having rented nearly all the videos at our local mom &amp; pop video rental store, and after this one came off the &quot;new release&quot; (more expensive) shelves, we gave it a try.  (I'll try any movie for $1.)... I'm proud to say that after renting it in excess of five times, we finally broke down and bought it.  A better purchase I could not have made!<br />This movie is clever, hilarious, and populated with some great characters.  Also, it's infinitely quotable, and nearly every scene rings true.  Thank goodness Mike Judge departed from Beavis &amp; Butthead to make this gem of a cinematic masterpiece.  (Okay, you might not file it next to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; but you would definitely put it somewhere between the Marx Brothers and Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson's &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;)  Make that comedic masterpiece.  For my money, it doesn't get much better than when John C. McGinley gives his monologue about Michael Bolton, or when Diedrich Bader comes over as the friendly neighbor, or when Mike Judge cameos and talks about &quot;flair,&quot; or when vengeance is taken on a certain office appliance... you get the idea.  (As I was making that list, about eight other favorite scenes popped into my head).<br />If you haven't seen it, give it a try.  If you have seen it and rented it more than twice (or recommended it to all your friends) then do yourself a favor and get it on DVD before it's no longer being sold.  Movies this classic don't come along very often...
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I'm not going to get into the storyline, but I will ask...why are so many reviewers confused by the ending of this movie?  What exactly don't you get?<br />I was pleasantly surprised by the bizarre nature of the film.  It was a little distracting at first, but my husband and I enjoyed putting the pieces of the puzzle together.  And I felt that the ending was pretty self-explanatory.<br />I really enjoyed this movie...while it might not be the most original film ever made, it certainly was an interesting one.
B000002UAO|5.0|RUBBER SOUL is an undeniably brilliant album, but before I get underway I want to address a statement I read in an earlier review, which I find difficult to believe that someone would actually make this statement. Matthew McDowell, in his review dated September 4, 2000, said this was the first significant album ever produced. That is simply an asinine statement. Even that year, Dylan gives The Beatles a run for their money (and arguably beats them, especially with HIGHWAY 61 Revisited), and both BIABH and HW61R were already released. There was a significant body of recordings and albums in other genres being produced for a long time, especially jazz, and his claim of RUBBER SOUL being first important album ever is both ridiculous and uninformed. That being said, I will resume the review proper.  RUBBER SOUL, The Beatles' sixth studio album in a mere three years, takes its place as the very first full length release that truly beings the evolution of away from the boy-girl \\"I Love you\\" pop that dominated the first half of their career.  The truly fascinating element of The Beatles are going through their recordings chronologically. You can watch that extremely rapid artistic growth explode. It is amazing that this is the same band who, a mere three years ago, recorded PLEASE PLEASE ME. Obviously, there are several influences that can be felt on this album, although The Beatles up the antes one with this release.  This album sounds like The Beatles playing (and beating) The Byrds at their own game. There are gorgeous three part harmonies, several compositions that would become standards almost on their release, and such a vast improvement artistically over the last five albums. The Beatles knew the time to move was now. Dylan had released BRINING IT ALL BACK HOME and HIGHWAY 61 REVISTED that year, both of which are much better aestheticallythan The Beatles' effort that year (HELP!).  The critics always talk about RUBBER SOUL being that pivotal album in The Beatles' artistic growth, but that is simply not true. While it is true that it is the first ALBUM by The Beatles to have that mature sound, about half of HELP! stands proudly alongside this release, as does the non lp tracks \\"Yes, It Is,\\" and \\"I Feel Fine,\\" which, to me, has always sound much more midperiod Beatles than the earlier material with which it belongs. Although it's true it's the first ALBUM of their mature sound, the seeds were already there in earlier material already released.  Sometimes I wonder what would have happened had they scrapped HELP!, but the five or six extra tracks on this, and released the other half as singles, but we can never know. What we do know, however, is that tracks like \\"Help!,\\" \\"Ticket to Ride,\\" \\"It's Only Love,\\" \\"Yesterday,\\" \\"I've Just Seen a Face,\\" and \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,\\" (which, by the way, is the best song Dylan never wrote) point toward this release. The first two tracks cited hearken back to tracks like \\"Hard Days' Night\\" and their earlier sound, the lyrics are much better and without expense to the melody.  Those who complain that the record company has butchered the pre-1967 Beatles releases by coming out with totally reconfigured albums are putting on prominent display their ignorance of The Beatles' history and the decadence of Capitol in regards to respecting the artistic integrity of their artists. There were ELEVEN*, count them, eleven U.S. albums released from1963 to 1966. In the UK, however, The Beatles had only issued FIVE albums before this. No one complains about these missing albums with the exception of this US version of RUBBER SOUL.  In those days, The Beatles were extremely hot commodities (which they still are) and the market supported singles more than albums anyway, so the reshuffling of all the tracks does not effect (much) the artistry of the songs until we get to RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER. It is only until SGT. PEPPER that the American version and the UK version coincided. The most famous of these bastardized American albums is \\"Yesterday . . . and Today,\\" the famous Butcher album, which is comprised of the four lost RUBBER SOUL tracks, two from the Side 2 of Help!, three from the then current REVOLVER sessions (the album was not completed when YESTERDAY was released), and the \\"Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out Single.\\" Yet that album has its place in Beatles history more for the cover as opposed to the music inside, although the music is brilliant. But of all the American albums, this and the U. S. RUBBER SOUL are the most sorely missed.  Why are they sorely missed? Well, there's a reason why there have been many people complaining about the UK version when they grew up with the American version. With the release of this particular album, The Beatles and their contemporaries (especially Dylan) were firmly moving the market away from the singles and were becoming much more album oriented, which is why this is the most controversial reconfiguration. The rest sound like a collection of singles: this sounds like a unified album. To those who argue that the American release is better I do not necessarily agree. \\"Nowhere Man\\" stands as a vastly important composition, the first of The Beatles to move beyond the boy-girl subject of their early pop material, and to remove it from this album makes the record suffer greatly. The American release compensated (partially) as having \\"Face\\" as the opener, which I greatly prefer to start the album off as opposed to \\"Drive My Car.\\" This version of the album also is strengthened by dropping the rather bland \\"What Goes On,\\" the worst track on the album.  As everyone praises this album, no one seems to fully discuss the disturbing \\"Run For Your Life,\\" an extremely misogynistic Lennon song and the most baffling song in The Beatles' canon. This song makes a rather weakened end, and Ringo's simply isn't that impressive.  Still, an enthusiastic five star release non-the-less.  * For those interested, on these eleven albums there are tracks that are no longer available commercially, although they are of only marginal interested to the general fan as they are only tracks used for scoring the movies. A HARD DAYS NIGHT has four instrumental tracks used for movie scoring which are currently unavailable. THE BEATLES' SECOND ALBUM supposedly has some tampering to it to the actual recordings themselves, though what I do not know. The U. S. version of HELP! contains five tracks of Ken Thorpe's film score from the movie, which makes it like the YELLOW SUBMARINE album.
B000002J2B|4.0|Since starting my Genesis collection in 1992 with We Can't Dance, I have traced back and forth the evolution of their sound with each succesive album purchase. With only 2 studio albums left to buy (Foxtrot and Lamb) it is seems clear that the best of the Gabriel-era Genesis and the Phil-era Genesis culminates on Trick of the Tail and Wind &amp; Wuthering. <br />As per usual in Genesis' history and future, the musical themes and instrumentations are reiterated in various parts of the album, resulting in a work that fits together like a symphony. The best fits are 11th Earl of Mar, One For The Vine, All In a Mouse's Night, Blood on the Rooftops and Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...In That Quiet Earth. Earl of Mar is a good intro, but it's not one that really sticks in my memory. Its theme is reprised toward the end of the album in ...In That Quiet Earth, and may also be elsewhere. Mouse's Night has to be my favorite. Following the perfect interlude &quot;Wot Gorilla?&quot; it's fun to listen to with lyrics you can follow and music to match. It really manages the Gabriel-era goofiness with a less grating, more polished sound. This song is a prime example of how these songs seem to be made for Phil Collins to sing. One For The Vine and Blood on the Rooftops are exceptionally well put together works of art. They just flow through changes in tempo and instrumentation like an ocean flowing onto a beach. One For The Vine's music and tempo gracefully ebbs and flows while Blood On The Rooftops is a prime example of Genesis' classical inclinations. The two relative bombs on this album are Your Own Special Way, which I must agree with most people here, doesn't really fit, and Afterglow, which it seems most people like. Afterglow is the last track of the album, and though it is not much better than Special Way, it has the virtue of capping the 'Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers...In That Quiet Earth' suite, which makes it a necessary element of the album. Special Way isn't too bad by itself, but doesn't match the quality of the rest of the album. And it doesn't have a suite of brilliant instrumentals to save it. <br />Overall, the measure of fun and excitement on this disc far outweighs the relative blandness of two tracks. Wind &amp; Wuthering contains so much wild and wondrous creativity on so many tracks that it remains fresh and exciting to listen to over and over again. But that's one of the things I've noticed about Genesis, at least the mid-70s to 1980 Genesis, their sound doesn't wear out. So where does this album rank amongst other Genesis albums? This album has a bias with me for having the coolest cover of any album anywhere. It also has a wonderfully kooky song about a mouse, along with many other creative masterpieces. But I'm thinking this album takes a backseat to at least Duke as far as overall greatness.
B00005Q4GA|3.0|There isn't a lot of plot to this movie, but it's still the best movie I've seen so far that's based on a video game. Great stunts and Angelina Jolie is sexy. This ought to keep action fans happy until INDIANA JONES 4 gets made.
1558216847|3.0|If true, then like all the others here, I give it 5-stars.  If it is nothing more than a tall-tale, it gets only 1-star (It is not a great piece of prose in and of itself, and decent ghost writers are a dime a dozen.)  I too would love to see more verification, but the trail must be cold (excuse the pun) after all these years.  Oh well.....
B00005ATZT|4.0|Taking the original tv series and turning into a movie, the general acting and directing is very good in the movie. With great special effects (that's a real train and bus) this movie makes it worth while to buy it. There are some plot issues, only to keep the movie short enough not to lose intrest, but the conviction of the good Dr. is a little quick and it intrest piques as to what his defense was, and how the prosecutor really convinced the jury that he was guilty. The movie bases the survival of the good Dr. on the fact that with only the knowledge of innocence can motivate you to jump off a 100 foot sewege drain, in order to be free, only to run back to the lion's den and try and prove your innocence. The plot is not entirely plausible, but it is a good watch!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is by far the best band of the 90's.  Any of you who do not agree with this statement have either not experienced Tool or are mentally retarted.  In this album Danny Carey lines each track with the most unbelievable drumming to hit the metal world yet.  Maynard's voice is unbelievable yet again.  And the combinations and complexity of rhythms used by both Justin Chancellor (bass) and Adam Jones (guitar)are nothing short of godlike.  This combination is unreal and if you have not yet experienced this album or any other Tool you need to get ahold of it real quick.  Tool is one of the only band's in the world that can sound live exactly as they do on their album's.  Tool has truly perfected the world of Rock/Metal all over again with Lateralus.
B000002AEN|3.0|I know that quite often people give three stars to cd's that they hate, or at least dislike. In the case of my rating for this cd I did not.<br />The reason I gave this cd three stars is because of Mississippi John's voice. I don't dislike his voice, but if I'm rating his recordings in comparison to those of other pre-war blues masters like Blind Willie Johnson or Lonnie Johnson or Charley Patton I think his voice is substantially less engaging and less emotional than are their voices. I don't dislike his voice, but no his name wouldn't be mentioned if I were asked to list my five or ten favorite blues singers of all time.<br />Having said that, his voice is easily overshadowed because of his immense guitar-playing skills. Honestly, I always tend to think that Mississippi John may be enjoyed more by listeners who enjoy the white folk-musics of Appalachia than by people who are mainly just blues fans. John just does not fit any sort of a conventional blues mold... whether it be vocals, songs, or guitar style, and because of that I think there are probably many blues fans who like Robert Johnson and Son House who very well may not like John.<br />Having said that, get this cd for his guitar playing. If you're familiar with, and you love Doc Watson, then you will certainly love John. I've always felt that at their very core, Doc's guitar phrasings are a mixture of one part Lonnie Johnson and two parts Mississippi John.<br />Like I said, he isn't my favorite singer in the world but his songs and his guitar playing certainly make him one of the most original musicians of his era, and considering the number of musical giants who were recording at the same time, that's saying quite alot.<br />It's impossible for me to hear him play guitar and not have a big smile on my face. His intricate, circular style of playing expresses pure joy.

B00005A1PR|4.0|I almost feel like I should apologize to India for waiting so long to review this. It certainly deserves better!<br /><br />I don't love all the songs on this cd, but the truly great songs on here are indispensable. I'm not sure what it is about India's music that grabs me. She seems to tap into an emotional something in a unique and earthy way. A couple of the things I really love on this cd are the Intro and the Interlude. These aren't really songs, they are songlets. It still amazes me that these little moments made up of just a hint of guitar, along with her voice and her special ways of saying thank you to a few people turn out to be such perfect little gems of heartfelt (though not cliche and sentimental) personal expression and musicality.<br /><br />Of course Video must be mentioned. The way this song so intelligently and perfectly shreds everything bad about MTV and the whole music-video scene (without ever resorting to negativity or name-calling) is a little miracle of melodic passive-resistance.<br /><br />Some of the lesser-known songs on here that I think are gorgeous are Back To The Middle, Ready For Love, and Beautiful.<br /><br />Back To The Middle is almost Buddhist in its gentle call for living a life of anti-extremes, and her voice is fantastic here.<br /><br />Ready For Love... wow, what can I even say about this song? Of course India is a female singing about what she wants in a male, and I am a male, but these lyrics and India's delivery here (where she seemingly gives silence a voice) are haunting in their beauty and in how closely the words she sings sound like things I say to myself in my head (heart?) when I think of \\"who or what I want in a female\\". Plus, it may have what I consider to be THE vocal highlight of the cd.<br /><br />The song Beautiful is just that. With this song we get to see a glimpse into India's fantasy world. I don't mean a world of surrealistic creatures and nightmares, but a world where humanity is allowed... no...ENCOURAGED... to fluorish in all its inspiring colors and languages and dreams and hopes and songs. India's truest gift (besides that voice) is her ability to write a song like this, which may sound preachy or stale in my explanation of it, but the song isn't stale or cliched at all. India's words here speak volumes but I'm afraid that my words fail to do justice to hers.<br /><br />If I ever find Beautiful I only hope that the time will be right and I'll be able to help as many people pack their bags as I possibly can so that I may take them with me.<br /><br />India has been to the mountaintop.lors and languages and dreams and hopes and songs.

0553277472|5.0|I am reading ZAMM for the third time and am finding it even more marvelous this time than the first two times (when I loved it). This book becomes more significant with the passage of time. Not only are his ideas illuminating and always fresh, but his take on modern society -- through his own experience with what is so loosely termed insanity -- is absolutely on target. His wonderful descriptions of his bouts with academia are both funny and unsettling, especially the excruciatingly entertaining episode with the Great Books seminar in Chicago. Pirsig is simply a beacon of independence and a roamer of the high spaces of the intellect invaluable to set off intellectual sparks and new approaches in anyone drawn to ideas. I think he would be worth reading if only for his elucidation of Kant's ideas (I have never been able to make head or tails out of Kant). A wonderful, wonderful book with something for everyone who thinks.
B00005N9CV|5.0|She has done it one more time. Another great musical experiance from the brightest star in jazz today. Diana covers alot of standards in her own way. Her versions of Cry Me A River, The Julie London classic and The Look of Love a Dusty Springfied classic are great without copying the styles of those two fine singers. The disc has only one real problem it is to short. We have had to wait two years for this modern day master, I just wish there was more songs to listen to. Hopefully we will not have to wait another two years for a follow up.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This movie won best picture of 1982. Can't remember what the other nominees were but I am quite sure this was the best from 1982. If Ben Kingsley was not around, I really don't think that Richard Attenborough could have made this movie. His resemblance with the real Gandhi is scary. During his interview, he recollected that even family members(who were still alive during filming) approved of his portrayal. It is an important movie that needs to be seen by everyone, especially after the event of Sep 11, 2001. The 190 minutes movie somehow manage to tell us what we need to know about Gandhi. There are some special features on the DVD, which include interview with Ben Kingsley. The DVD picture transfer is good. The Dolby 5.1 is quiet most of the time as this movie is 90% dialogue, but there are some nice left and right separation for the front channel (people moving across the room, vehicles moving from left to right). Overall this is a must buy DVD.
B00005NW02|5.0|I admit it. I'm one of those pretentious music geeks who only listens to obscure stuff that only other pretentious music geeks have heard of and I only listen to new stuff in secret. Just kidding.<BR>I did buy this album because I heard &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; a bunch of times on the radio and saw the kickass video on M2. Having never been a huge fan of the first album, I wasn't expecting a whole lot to sink my teeth into. Well, I'm certainly the fool here because this sucker is badass from start to finsish. Starting with &quot;Prison Song&quot; and ending with &quot;Aerials&quot;, Toxicity grabs the listener around the throat and flings you around like a rag doll for nearly an hour. While the album's greatness came as no suprise to the fans, this was my shock of the year. I had no idea it would be so good. If I could only come up with two words to describe this album it would be &quot;sheer energy&quot;. I guess one reason I like it so much is that they kinda remind me of some of the harder stuff that Faith No More (one of my all time favorite bands) did back when they were still Faith No More. I only say this because of the band's eccentricties and Serj Tankian's ability to change his voice. His random vocal switches remind me of Mike Patton, both with Faith No More and Mr. Bungle. I love how they can switch from being dead serious while throwing in a little saracasm and still sound heartfelt. How many bands can seethe with rage on one song, then turn around and do a song about a pogo-stick, all on the same album? I liked Toxicity so much, I bought it twice (I never do that). I'll be catching these guys next month when they hit St. Louis, on the Pledge of Allegience Tour. It doesn't really matter where your musical taste runs. It may be a bit off beat for some people, but I'm sure that many will find something to like here. God, I sure did. I feel like such an idiot for not giving these guys a chance earlier, when I should've.  Anyone who really digs this album might also want to look into Mr. Bungle or Faith No More's &quot;Angel Dust&quot; and &quot;King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime&quot;.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Even after all those years, since I saw the movie the first time, I still had the same amount of chills and the excitement while I watched it over and over again. It is one of the best suspense/horror type of movies I have ever seen. The colors, the decors, the special effects, and the performers are incredible. ENJOY!
B000003AEB|5.0|THIS ALBUM ROCKS. THIS ALBUM IS DA BOMB. THIS IS SNOOPS FIRST, AND BEST ALBUM. HE ROCKS. DRE ROCKS. I  DON'T KNOW WHO  ELSE ROCKS. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. THIS IS THAT OLD G SH** AND YOU GOTTA GET IT. THIS IS F**CKIN STUPENDOUS.
076783819X|4.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I loved the plot and the wonderful suspense.  However, the ending wasnt really good.  I think it should have given just a little more information on what happened to the man Jeff Bridges played.
B00005N9CV|2.0|This is an over-produced disaster.  The musicianship we want to hear is DK not the London Symphony Orchestra.  Not a jazz lick to be heard, just ballads with too many strings.  I'm embarrassed that so much talent was wasted.
1559408855|5.0|Pasolini's swan song. I've shown this movie in my home and have been amused more by the reaction this movie gets than the movie itself. you kind of have to see it to believe it. The sets are awesome, the story is about as luridly satirical as you can get. I've said it once, I'll say it again Pier Paolo Pasolini was a modern day Marquis de Sade. It's a shame he was killed after this film opened.
B00005NVDI|4.0|&quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot; probably has one of the cheesiest &quot;special effects&quot; from &quot;Star Trek&quot;....Bele's &quot;invisible&quot; ship. They could've saved themselves alot of embarrassment by saying, &quot;It's cloaked&quot;. Other that, that, the message is desperately needed for today.
0780020693|4.0|Why do I like this movie, in 1000 words or less without sounding pretentious? Bicycle seats, Mussolini's floral bust conducting an imaginary wedding ceremony, Uncle Tio in the tree screaming,<BR>&quot;I need a woman&quot;, the preist and the young boy philosophizin' about masterbation, etc., etc. I swear, buy this movie which is much better than Roma or Satyricon or hell even La Dolce Vita for that matter and you won't be disappointed, and after you've enjoyed this fine, fine, film you might as well enjoy The City of Women.
0140177396|3.0|Well this is my first time to read one of John Steinbeck book.Mice and men was so great it was really an interesting one. I hope you would like it too.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I know this wasn't as good as the originals, but considering all factors it wasn't bad. Since this is the first movie it has to lay the foundation for all SIX films, so of course there wasn't that much of a plot. I reas that it was also childish and had Jar Jar because Lucas wanted a lighter film due to the darker themes of the next two. This is when Anaking turns to vader and the republic declines.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I've been a Diana Krall fan since Only trust your heart.  I think this album is allright, but is very far from where Diana really shines: when she is playing and singing upbeat jazz with a small (drumless) trio.  The addition of the orchestra somehow muddys things up.  Bring back the days of Love Scenes!
B000002IZM|4.0|Great CD - Voiceovers are Awesome, they take you right back into the movie !<br />ONLY issue is that nasty little song &quot;One More Kiss, Dear&quot;, has NOTHING to do with the rest of the cd and takes you away from the surreal &quot;trip&quot; that the rest of this cd takes you through. <br />Must Have for BR fans.
B000002H8F|4.0|I encountered the Pixies while in college in the early 90's (yes, I was there pre-Nirvana when we remembered the band for its first album, not &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;). DOOLITTLE became pretty much an instant classic on college radio, including the station where I worked on-campus. It is generally regarded as their finest moment, and I wouldn't dispute that claim. BOSSANOVA, however, is my personal favorite album. It takes a while to grow on you, but after several listens, the songs begin to stick in your head. By this time, the DOOLITTLE follow-up, they had edged just a step or two towards mainstream acceptability. Their sound, still raw, is a little more refined and has turned away from their earlier, punk sound (if only for a moment). BOSSANOVA displays a greater range of the band's songwriting abilities, venturing more into surf and other areas. It's not better than DOOLITTLE, it doesn't rock as hard as the earlier stuff, and it's not necessarily the best place to start your Pixies collection. It is, however, a very good album, despite the critical disses it received at the time. I'd rate it as a very good second-best to DOOLITTLE, which ain't too bad in my book.
0446525537|5.0|In a time when the world seems like a horrible place, along comes A Walk to Remember. A beautiful story that will make you see there are still people with morals and convictions. Probably the best Nicholas Sparks book.
B000002GQH|5.0|In the late sixties The Moody Blues were often labeled the cosmic stock brokers, because of their love of making mystical music, whilst not adverse to filling the coffers.<br /> But I digress, in 1966 The Moody Blues were washed up, after a solitary hit (mind you it was a number one, on both sides of the Atlantic with \\"Go Now\\") They were playing the scampi &amp; chips northern England club scene for a pittance.<br /> Original lead singer Denny Laine had left the band for greener pastures, (finally joining up with ex - Beatle Paul McCartney in Wings) and replacements Justin Hayward &amp; John Lodge were not having an easy ride settling in. The situation reached its nadir when one club promoter offered them some advice \\"Don't come back here lads, You're the worst outfit I've ever booked\\". On the lonely Transit Van (a necessity to any aspiring band in the sixties) ride home, the two new members actually burst into tears. But two years later The Moody Blues mark two were selling millions and touring the world.<br /> Begging the indulgence of their record label Deram, they disappeared into the studio and transformed themselves as a caterpillar to a butterfly, from a pop singles band, into a progressive rock albums band.<br /> The band themselves reject the pigeon hole, when Justin Hayward was asked whether he felt any affinity with the progressive rock movement he replied, \\"I don't think we feel any affinity with anybody\\".<br /> The critics certainly saw something dodgy in their cosmic makeover &amp; when the band admitted holding regular business meetings in their stately homes, they were judged terminally unhip.<br /> But unfazed by this the Moodies concentrated on turning up on time for gigs &amp; performing well, their ability to duplicate their intricately recorded material live on stage could be phenomenal, just ask anyone who saw them live in the late sixties or early seventies.<br /> Following the tentative orchestral explorations of \\"Days of Future Past\\" &amp; \\"In Search of The Lost Chord\\". \\"On The Threshold Of a Dream\\" finds the band in confident mood, starting off the dream sequence of \\"In The Beginning\\" with the wonderfully over the top lyrics of \\"I think, I think therefore I am, I think.

B0000026UL|3.0|Ive read many reviews of this album from two months before it came out in September 1989 to the present day. I have been a fan of Dylan for nearly 20 years and own ALL his albums. I feel able to put this album in perspective as a result. Yes its good by any standards with 3 great songs: Ring Them Bells, Man In Long Black Coat, Most of the Time (all follow each other, incidentally) and 1 very good song: Shooting Star which closes. The rest are simply OK, with the exception of Disease of Conceit which is dire and Political World which is trite, embarrassing and completely tuneless as well as lacking in any energy. Everything Is Broken is one of Bob's so-called &quot;list&quot; songs and I would judge it as only acceptable. Hell, I could write a better song than that. Its a pile of rhymes for anything we could suggest might be broken....heads, beds, teds, feds (Bob, you left a few out, mate!) So that leaves a question as to why his other much better 80's albums like Infidels and Empire Burlesque were dismissed largely, whilst this one enjoys &quot;critical support&quot; on a scale not seen since 1966....yes, 1966! Not 1975, after all, Blood on the Tracks and Desire (latter, rightly so in my opinion)did not receive unanimous rapturous applause. It has been suggested that the 2 half-baked albums before this are responsible in part for the praise the critics gave this one. A sort of breath of fresh air then to clear the worries that Dylan had finally blown his creative stack at the end of the 80's.....quite possibly. So Oh Mercy (for me at least) goes down in Bob history as the album which garnered welcome and long overdue praise on behalf of earlier and more deserved siblings, ie Empire Burlesque which is his best and most frequently overlooked 80's album.
0393307050|5.0|Be warned. This is the first in a series of twenty books. Initially, you will settle for the paperbacks but eventually you will want to own the series in hardback. You will, in your enormous enthusiasm, lend your copies to people whom you thought were your friends, until they fail to return them. There will be massive expense, bitter recrimination and much strife in the family home. Your spouse will say to you, on a regular basis, \\"Surely you're not reading those books again?\\" <BR>He/she may doubt your sanity. You may doubt your own sanity as you drone on about being born two hundred years too late. You will feel anguish as you come towards the end of the series. You will acknowledge the lesser volumes. (there are one or two low points) You will rue your lack of general knowledge as the author ranges effortlessly far and wide through myriad subjects and languages. You will come to know the characters like your own family. You will celebrate with them in victory and tremble and weep with them in defeat. And you will be an addict.
0060987464|5.0|this is the best book i ever read. I told all my friends about it.
6305428557|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD from Amazon so that I can see it again and again. I was brought up in the area of Wales this story features and it perfectly captures the Celtic sense of humour and the unique way that they can laugh at themselves and with themselves. No sex or violence - just a great story of a proud people who fiercely react to the possibility of losing their most prized asset. Inspired casting and beautiful camera work make this movie very easy to watch.
B00005NW02|5.0|This is how i usualy shop for cds i hear or see the video then if i like i buy the cd When i saw the video for the song chop suey i was impressed. S O A D has a metal / harmoney / guitar thing goin on and i was really feelin it. we all know how some artist have that one good song and the rest is trash. thsi is not the case here. The rest of the cd shockingly good but chop suey is still the best. The bottom line is this: if you liked chop suey then what are you waiting for buy it now. trust me, you wont be disappointed.
0440219078|3.0|I read this books for the first time when I was ten years old, and I loved it.  It was one of my very favorite books.  In the seven years since then, I've read Brave New World, 1984, and especially Ayn Rand's Anthem and discovered that The Giver is extremely, extremely unoriginal.  Virtually plagiarized.  The Giver has some pretty heavy ideas in it that I didnt really understand at ten years old, so I think it's be better for kids to skip it altogether and then read BNW, 1984, and Anthem when they're a few years older.  If you're even into that sort of thing.  As a liberal, I tend to get annoyed at the idea that any minor attempts at some level of equality will lead to a society of faceless drones - that's a really black-and-white way to see the world (no pun intended, to those who have read the book).  I'm kind of bummed that Lowry, one of my favorite authors as a child, is apparently being so extreme, and I can only hope that she isn't really another Rand, as I'm not really a fan of hers.  Politics aside, I commend this book for its storytelling and for the fact that it at leats has some intelligent ideas in it, unlike lots of the stupid, trashy books out there that kids read.  However, like I said earlier, some scenes are too depressing and intense for your average kid, and plus it's completely lacking in originality.  My vote for a favorite dystopian novel goes to Orwell's 1984.
B00000373U|2.0|I hate to be the voice of dissent on this board. I bought this album after going to a really great Mary Lou Lord concert where all she did was rave about Eliot, so I just went out and purchased it, without ever hearing any Eliot songs. The album is very quiet and Eliot's voice is high and not very good. The lyrics are disappointingly shallow. The melodies are okay. &quot;Between the Bars&quot; is the one salvaging tune on the CD, it's a nice little song (little being the operative word). Then I went online and read some reviews of Eliot Smith. Critics were pretty mixed, but mostly positive. Mary said Eliot reminded her of Joni Mitchell in her &quot;Cold Blue Steel&quot; phase. I just can't see the connection.<BR>I just can't really see what's so great about this album. Your immensely positive reviews interest me, however, and I'll have to go back and listen to it again. I doubt I'll change my mind. I think Eliot just needs to be louder.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Although the DVD is lacking in lots of extra features, the movie more than makes up for what it lacks.  The animation is incredible with sweeping vistas and awesome special effects.  Very nice.  The story is based a lot on man vs nature and has lots of hidden story lines.  Great for the hardcore fan but probably too much for younger kids.  There are some pretty graphic scenes which I love but may be inappropiate for the younger crowd.  Nicely done and a great adventure.
B00005NP04|5.0|Fantastic CD!  Martina has a range that is unmatched in any type of music. Toss in the blue eyes and you have one heck of a musician!
B00005AXEL|3.0|Maybe it's just me but after listening to this CD, I felt as if it could have been so much more. Stevie Nicks still has the vocal power and finesse to turn even the most average song into something special. Recommended for those who just love her voice. Otherwise it's nothing spectacular.

0783226063|5.0|This version of dune is, hence the title, well done. Compared to the later remake, it is remarkable. Not only does is stick to the storyline and details of the sci-fi novel, it portrays it greatly. The effects are well done, there is good talent, and the eyes are enhanced, but not over done. The part of Jessica is the best I've seen yet. All the actors fit the roles perfectly. But what makes it truly great is the fantastic novel that was written by Frank Herbert. If you were dissapointed with the movie, at least go read the book. Some people have considered this movie to be too dark, but I disagree. This is how the story was told in the first place. If you can't handle it, suck it up. It is truly worth watching, even if you're just in it to see the cinematography and effects, even though I'd highly recommend you to follow the plot.
0452282152|1.0|If I had paid full price for this novel I would have been mad...luckily I got a discount. I learned (once again!)..just because it's on the bestseller list doesn't mean it's a great book. In this case, a milktoast plot with boring characters, as well as the author's inability to write interesting descriptions make it a great read for some people. People who don't want to bother with pesky plots and tedious historical details could come to call this a masterpiece. I'm guessing that this period in history was interesting with things like the plague, religious conflict, and oppression of all kinds, but the author skims over these interesting points as if there is something more interesting just around the corner...trust me. There isn't. The author seems to have written this novel very quickly. It reads like a summary of a story. It has very short sentences. This can be dull. Get it?<BR>I suppose that the life of a maid must have been difficult and tiring in the 17th century, but Griet seems to stay pleasant and intact very well through it all. The only thing she has to conquer is the fact that everyone hates her. She doesn't have a single female friend in the entire town! This is going on the 4th book that I've read recently, where the female character is beautiful, virtuous, hated, vicitmized and has no friends. Miraculously, these heroines remain positive with virtually no support system. I'm getting tired of this! How about some depth!? Please!<BR>Don't bother with this one. It's about as interesting as 'The Bridges of Madison County'....another generic bestseller for the masses.
B00005NZBN|4.0|With \\"Love and Theft,\\" Bob Dylan continues his exploration of the blues and American roots music. This disc includes some of Dylan's finest blues recordings (and that's saying something). \\"Lonesome Day Blues\\" and \\"High Water (for Charley Patton)\\" are low-down, gutbucket masterpieces. And \\"Mississippi\\" is achingly beautiful and wistful. There's some straight-ahead rock and roll, in \\"Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum\\" and \\"Honest With Me.\\" And Bob even croons a little romantic ditty, in \\"Moonlight.\\" Just a lovely variety of styles here, played wonderfully by Bob and his band. By all means, buy the two-disc limited edition, for the unreleased version of \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'.\\" Dylan's elegiac reading of the song makes it more poignant and visionary than ever, especially in the wake of the tragedy of Sept. 11.

B00003CXX8|2.0|This review is going to be short and sweet:<br />1.  Leelee Sobieski is the only reason to see this movie and one day someone is going to give her a chance to prove how great I think she can be.<br />2.  Diane Lane is wasted in a ridiculous role of a doctor/drug addict.  She should have known better having been in films since she was approx. 10 yrs old.<br />3.  Has the director, Daniel Sackheim ever seen an Alfred Hitchcock or for god's sake a Wes Craven movie?<br />4.  The &quot;glass house&quot; is extraordinarily beautiful.<br />Thanks.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is one of those rare films that manages to do something new.  On one level, this film is a simple crime thriller.  Guy Pearce plays the disabled Leonard who is searching for his wife's killer despite being hampered by the inablity to make any new memories.  Though the mystery element of the plot is compelling, the true force of the movie comes from its ablity to let you experience a series of events from Leonard's perspective.  The movie runs backwards in ten minute clips that mirror the increadibly short period of time in which Leonard can maintain linear awareness.  You watch as Leonard is thrust into a situation and, along with Leonard, you have no idea how he got there.  It is only after the scene has run its course and the movie skips to the next sequence that you are finally given the answer.  However, every answer you are granted unearths three times as many new questions, and you find your attention rapt and unrelenting as you wait for the appearance of Leonard's next random adventure.  <BR>This movie is as compelling as any that have been released in recent memory.  Like &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; the events of the film are not presented linearly, thus making the editing a major factor in the effect of the film.  The structure is increadibly unique and well crafted.  The movie starts at the chronological end and moves backwards in jumps which are separated by black and white segments that take place in the distant past.  The narrative lines run towards each other and eventually connect using the very clever device of watching a polaroid picture develop (thus providing the bridge from black and white to color).<BR>Guy Pearce gives a tremendous performance.  If he got your attention in L.A. Confidential, he's proved himself to be a formidable actor here, much like Brad Pitt's career defining performance in &quot;Seven.&quot;  But really there is not much more I can say, the whole supporting cast is superb, the script is well above average and the direction and film construction is magnificent.  This is a daring and thought provoking movie and if you have any interest at all in the genre of film it is not one that you can possibly justify having missed.
B0000046JP|5.0|I've only listened to the first movement of the Concierto de Aranjuez as played by Paco de Lucia, which is included in a Paco de Lucia anthology (thus I can only rate the first track of this CD, while not having heard the rest of the CD). Paco and the Orquesta de Cadaques really put the Spirito in the Allegro of the first movement. It's the best performance I've heard--full of rythmic energy and excitement. I think the flamenco guitar (I'm assuming that's the instrument Paco is playing) and technique are most suitable for the first movement. On the other hand, I suspect the classical guitar may be more suitable for the more famous second movement (John Williams' performance with the Seville Orchestra being my favorite).
B0000041LO|5.0|These are among the most beautiful and satisfying CDs that I own.  The performances are nothing short of sublime, and preserve the essence of the best years of the Beaux Arts Trio.  The recordings themselves are balanced and have both warmth and intimacy.  While the trios themselves do not have the same depth as Haydn't finest quartets, they are superb in their own right.  These discs would be high on the list of my desert-isle collection.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This is the Dylan disc that deserves the praise given to the uneven Time Out of Mind. Where the 12-bar blues tracks on Time sounded lethargic, the ones here have a fiery bite. In fact, who could have foreseen the 60-year-old Bob sounding like Captain Beefheart, as he does on Cry a While?<BR>No sane person would argue that Dylan's voice isn't shot. The beauty of this disc is that he is now writing songs accordingly. In fact, it's hard to imagine the beautiful Po' Boy sung in anything but Bob's current raspy wheeze.<BR>Even better is the pacing: blistering blues tracks alternate methodically with dreamy, dust-bowl melodies --- all played by a band that makes this one of Dylan's most musical ventures.<BR>And where Time was dark and direct, Love and Theft is vintage Dylan: funny, joyful and surreal.<BR>Bottom line: 12 5-star songs. I'd like to see anyone top that this year.<BR>The bonus disc (only two tracks) is a fun listen. I was Young When I Left Home is a blue variation on 500 Miles, sung by a 20-year-old Dylan. The alternate version of The Times They Are a-Changin'(1963)is somewhat more melodic than the released version, and remains more relevant than ever.<BR>In the end, the bonus disc would have dwarfed many previous new Dylan releases. Not this time. This is, quite simply, a classic.

6300214710|5.0|I don't understand some of the comments I am reading..oh well..This movie is so good, I guess I would say that Andie is a girl who does not live in the rich part of town, but not exactly the slums either, and its not that she is unpopular, she is just her own person, and some of the rich, popular girls tease her about her clothes, which she makes herself and are a little different, but cool, but I think the girls that pick on her are just mean, and those types of people do exist in highschool, and they always find someone to pick on...Andie has friends, they are just not the rich, popular ones...And they are seniors, so H.S. is almost over, and Andie is pretty, so I can see Blaine wanting to ask her out, why not???? Then he gets a little nervous about losing all his friends over it, well he probably realizes, he likes Andie, and she likes him, and there is life after H.S. right? Well Andies best friend \\"Duckie\\" who is so awesome, especially when he does that little lip sinc to \\"try a little tenderness\\" that was one of my favorite scenes in any movie ever...very cool!!!!He is in love with Andie and is mad when she decides to go with with Blaine, which he says is a major appliance not a name...haa haa...but it all comes together in the end...Great Movie...Two thumbs up!!!
068484267X|4.0|I have a great deal of mixed feelings about this book. It had been recommended to me several times so I decided to buy it and read it. I was bowled over by the tremendous poverty of the Irish people and many times near tears. Surprised by the discrimination within their own country against each other based upon wealth, religion or birthplace. There are great moments of humor within this book that at times are hard to laugh at but one has to see them through the eyes of the child. This is a book you love to hate or hate to love. Hard to put it down but hard to pick it up as well. If nothing else, read it for the insight into the Irish people and their history.
6301972139|2.0|The only Moulin Rouge film I've seen is from the TV and I would imagine the video is another U S only one. But 1952 is no excuse for such poor quality color and this is what it was like in the cinemas. Maybe the video has enhanced it. <BR>Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein would never have allowed anything of theirs to come out in such a state as they supervised the filming of things like Oklahoma and Carousel.<BR>You want criticism you got criticism.The real Moulin Rouge has yet to be made as the new film leaves a lot to be desired
0375703764|5.0|After reading some of the reviews, both good and bad, I just have this feeling I read a totally different book.  First of all, I thought House of Leaves was brilliant and innovative.  I've never read anything like it.  But my focus of this book was not the House, nor Navidson, nor Zampano, but Johnny, and his descent into insanity.  The rest of the book is just allegory for what is going on with Johnny, don't you think?  But the rest of the book was fascinating, freaky, occasionally scary, way too erudite and definitely too compelling to put down.<br />Is it &quot;classic literature&quot;?  Well, no, of course not.  That's not the point.  The point is to stretch the idea of the novel.  But it is well-written, successfully alternating between character voices and vocabularies.  It is not plot-driven, but that's not a problem if you delve into the characters created.  And yes, the minor characters are not deeply developed, but the major ones are developed more deeply than many I've ever read before.<br />My only complaint is the book doesn't tie things into a nice little package at the end, regarding Johnny.  I'm still a bit miffed trying to figure out that last bit written by Johnny.  I like the idea of the concept-novel, but I'm still stuck in the rigidity of having a nice ending that ties it all together.  But maybe I need to change my expectation when dealing with something like this, and not the other way around.<br />Given all this, I don't recommend this book unless you are open-minded and flexible.  And have either a great vocabulary or a good dictionary.
6301972139|2.0|The only Moulin Rouge film I've seen is from the TV and I would imagine the video is another U S only one. But 1952 is no excuse for such poor quality color and this is what it was like in the cinemas. Maybe the video has enhanced it. <BR>Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein would never have allowed anything of theirs to come out in such a state as they supervised the filming of things like Oklahoma and Carousel.<BR>You want criticism you got criticism.The real Moulin Rouge has yet to be made as the new film leaves a lot to be desired
B00005LMBK|2.0|I like the song Clint Eastwood, so even after reading so many mixed reviews I ordered the CD.  The CD is like a mixture of every style of music that exist.  It is bound to have at least one song you will like, however, not many people buy a CD for one song.  <br />Personally, I am going to tape that one song I like and sell the CD.  I listened to it several times, hoping it would grow on me.  I tried, but no interest.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I am a hip-hop fan. I won't get into it, but if you knew of all of the other cds I own, you'd probably be very surprised that I not only own, but like this album. I would actually rate this cd 4 1/2 stars if I could. I really like the smash hits &quot;Southside&quot; and &quot;Natural Blues&quot;. I also enjoy some of the slower songs on here as well. Also, even though I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan, I think that Moby has many great views about the world and is a class-act role model. The only reason I took off half a star was because since the album was so long, I just thought that there were some songs not good enough to be on the record.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Now that the Home Theatre environment is becoming more common it is time to sort the GOOD from the BAD DVD's. This is only from a videophile who enjoys the total viewing and listening Home Theatre experience. The movies themselves are the main ingredient but unfortunately Film Studios don't always give us what we think we are getting. (Quality vs quantity) Another words they are already re-releasing DVD movies with enhancements and extras for wide screen TV's etc. So we need to buy right the first time and not repeat buying on the same movie.<BR>My first (#1) Home Theatre DVD Review &quot;The Apartment&quot; is an AFI (American Film Institute) top 100 movie of the last 100 years. It won &quot;5&quot; Oscars including &quot;Best Picture of 1960&quot;, and Best Director, Billy Wilder (in 1959 he directed, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; - voted by AFI as the #1 Comedy in the last 100 years) So you can see this was and is a GREAT Comedy (filmed in Black and White). Jack Lemmon, Shirely MacClaine and Fred MacMurray lead the emsemble cast.<BR>Simply put its a boy meets girl, falls in love she is distracted by another man and &quot;The Apartment&quot; brings them together. A great story, great characters and the greatest comedic director.<BR>Now this DVD is Digitally ReMasterd (Picture and Sound). It is enhanced for widescreen 16:9 (Aspect Ratio) TV's &amp; HDTV's. The movie's 235:1 means you still get a LETTERBOX presentation but it is enhanced for maximum viewing enjoyment. The Picture clarity is perfect (480p - 480 horz lines with Progressive Scan (a line doubler feature.  NOTE: regular DVD players are 480i). The only extra is a Trailer. &quot;The Apartment&quot; is a must both for its entertainment value and viewing quality. It is the best!!!!
B00005NB0H|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said about this classic album.  It is definately one of the best live rock albums ever which finally gets the treatment that all Who fans have been waiting for.  It is the entire show from that magical night with all of Tommy being included.  Let me just tell you that having all of Tommy being performed live is worth the price of admission itself.  Personally I have waited for a live Tommy for years and finally that wish becomes a reality.  Although I wish they had made a single disc of live Tommy available since most of us who are purchasing this already have the single cd of Live at Leeds already.  But the packaging and remastering are first class and I hope most Who fans aren't going to pass on this since they already have the single cd.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I was skeptical of Journey with a new lead singer at first, but after listening to Steve Augeri,there is not one bit of skepticism left.  He is a great lead vocalist and Journey sounds greater than ever!  Arrival has all the great Journey traits - great vocals, great guitar and just feel good music.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|I'm just a casual reggae fan, I'll admit, and I much prefer hearing it played live to listening to records (my former home in North Carolina made that possible fairly often).  Maybe that's why I love this CD so much.  Legend culls Marley's biggest hits, but it's a grab bag and feels like it.  However, this CD is a coherent piece that captures the artist's true soul, with definitive versions of many classics that didn't make it onto Legend, like &quot;Lively Up Yourself&quot; and &quot;Rebel Music.&quot;<br />Those who love 20th-century music, not just reggae, should add this to their collections as one of its towering works.  Enough said.
B00005JKES|5.0|I have recently been re-watching TP on nearly worn out tapes from my local video store, delighting in all the details that had slipped from my mind over the years. Where is creativity like this in TV today? Where is there a show that takes artistic risks and leaps and isn't afraid to depart from reality in ways that may look foolish to those who aren't paying attention? Who will ever forget Josie's appearance in the doorknob or Leland Palmer's rendition of Surrey With the Fringe on Top?<br />It's said that truth is stranger than fiction--well, I'm undecided as to whether truth is stranger than Twin Peaks, but I do know I am thrilled that they have finally put part of it on DVD. It's on the top of my Christmas list (if I can wait that long!)...
B00005MAM2|5.0|I was fortunate enough to buy this in the metal tin while they were still available. Lately, I've seen a fold around cardboard package for this item on store shelves.<br />Akira is a magnum opus in anime. It brought anime to the attention of America in ways that Speed Racer and Robotech never could.<br />The DVD restores the film's animation quality to the glory that it deserves, and that we had not previously seen on video releases here in America.<br />This rerelease also sports a new English dub which follows the original script more closely than the first dub did. The new voice actors also play their parts with zeal and emotion, although I do miss the first voice of The Colonel.<br />The extras are top notch too. There are documentaries that are as long as the movie, and wonderful stills and a comprehensive encyclopedia that lists information not only from the film, but also from the manga.<br />This movie is what DVD is all about.
B000056K04|4.0|I have very strong feelings toward this album.  One thing that I love about Dave Matthews Band is every CD that they've put out has it's own sound. They reach a new level every time they put something out. Although I strongly reccomend buying this CD I have to say that I liked their last two albums better. Again, if you are a Dave Matthews fan, this is an excellent addition!
B00000BKDW|5.0|This is definetly one of the greatest metal albums ever. Bruce Dickinson is such a great vocalist. He resembles Geoff Tate a lot. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray are just superb on this album. Their classical and egyptian progression sounds so awesome. Great guitar riffs, harmonies, and solo's. The best tracks are Rime of the Ancient Mariner and The Duelists.
0345440757|4.0|I bought this book because I am the type of person who really needs some structure in my life. Now that doesn't mean that I am a bad mother or expect a baby to be on a<BR>strict schedule - just that I'm the type of person who needs some predictibility in my life. That said, I recommend this book to first-time moms (like me) who need some guidance<BR>figuring out how to understand the signals of a new baby by understanding the differences in their cries and body language. The EASY schedule the author proposes is just a GUIDE. I think she provides<BR>information on how to start ordering you and your baby's life<BR>but she does not advocate just ignoring your own good sense or<BR>being so strictly on a schedule that you and your baby don't thrive. Overall, I think that the book is well-written, insightful and helpful. The chapters are short and easily read between feedings, burpings, bathings, ect. I do not believe that the book provides enough examples of actual E.A.S.Y. schedules and concrete examples of how to adjust routines when things change (e.g. baby illness, returning to work). It seems as if the book was written to give the reader just enough information to get by - which may be exactly the point of her book. The parent gets some guidelines and really does the parenting in their own way. I think that other criticisms of this book really come from people who don't take the author's advice when she recommends that you take the info that works for you and throw the rest out. Also, I don't recommend this book for brand-new breastfeeding moms. I think it is truly difficult to create any type of schedule when you are first learning how to breastfeed. It's unrealistic and puts unnecessary pressure on the mom to try to successfully learn all of the skills required to breastfeed and institute a schedule at the same time.
B00003CXSP|3.0|While this movie has some good qualities about it, it can safely be said that it isn't as good as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  The thing that gets this is the story.  The story seems to have no real planning at all.  Things happen that aren't ever really explored or aren't paid too much attention to.  The story is basically a revenge plot, in which a rich former patient of Hannibal's wants to capture him and have him tortured to death because Hannibal horribly disfigured him.  The movie has three stories in one.  We have a guy who wants to capture Lecter to torture him, an Italian investigator who wants to capture Lecter for a reward, and Clarice Starling, who wants to capture Lecter and has to indure her disgrace in the FBI.  While highly talked about, the violence isn't really as bad as people said it was.  Most of the violence happens in 2 scenes.  The music is amazing and the locations are amazing as well.  I would recommend seeing it because it is interesting to watch, but don't take it seriously.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I am an enormous Beatles fan and I think Fiona Apple's album is great.  I love Led Zeppelin and I still consider When the Pawn to be an amazing album.  It's quite simple ladies and gents...this is the best album of the 1990s by ANY female artist.  Hands Down.  The lyrics are astonding and the mood of the music is unmatched.  Tidal was very good, but compared to this second effort it looks calm and restrained.  &quot;I Know,&quot; the last song on the record (and my favorite track every once in a while--depending on my mood) sums up what Fiona is all about...In the first lines of this wounded piano based ballad she claims she is just a &quot;crowbar&quot; to her love (How great of a choice of words is that?!?!?). Then, typical of Fiona, she uses a clever play on a word, in this case -being- &quot;For the time being, I'm being patient.&quot; And then she sums up the last verse with an extended metaphor describing her situation of love about to be lost using stage props and the theater which leaves me in awe.  But the best thing about the song is the last lines.  <br />And if it gets too late, for me to wait<BR>For you to find you love me, and tell me so<BR>It's Ok, you don't need to say it<br />She never finishes the line.  You are left waiting for a voice that is not heard.  It is obvious that the last line should be: &quot;It's Ok, you don't need to say it cause I know.&quot;--which would complete the rhyme, but there is nothing.  It just ends and you think you missed it.  With such a strange ending I was compelled to go back and see what the name of the song was the first time I heard it and, of course, the title was &quot;I Know&quot; which just happened to be the missing component of the line.  What a unique ploy and what an emotional song!<BR>For atmosphere and intriguing lyrical ideas alone you should buy this album today--but when you add the diverse music and offsetting voice, When the Pawn is a present day classic.
B00003CY5K|4.0|While the plot is more than a bit implausible, the movie is very cute. See this if you are depressed or otherwise just need a pick-me-up. I love Reese so much I could chew her up and swallow her!
B00003652Q|5.0|This is just a phenomenal album, by a phenomenal band.This is the best Marillion album. Fish is a really great vocalist, and his poetry is so deep, it's incredible! Mark Kelly is a great keyboardist. He can be very complex and very soothing, he's outstanding. The stand-out tracks are, well, all of them. Every single track is amazing!...
B000000HTM|5.0|I have always felt that their previous effort, H to He Who Am the Only One was the better album, but Pawn Hearts is not too far behind. Pawn Hearts is by far their most hard-edged, aggressive album they released in their early 1969-1971 phase. &quot;Lemmings&quot; is nothing short of the greatest piece VdGG had ever done with a great spacy Hammond organ at the end. I am never short of amazed hearing that, I often wonder why Rolling Stone and MTV are making kids be only aware of second-rate music (Britney Spears, for example). The lyrics to &quot;Lemmings&quot; seems to refer to people who don't think for themselves and blindly follow others, like lemmings, into disaster. I thought &quot;Man-Erg&quot; was a bit uneven, it seems to drag on later than it needed to, but the album closes with the excellent &quot;Plague of Lighthouse Keepers&quot;. It's a suite just full of plain weirdness, from more melodic passages to insane sounding passages. One of my favorite parts is the part that goes, &quot;I can see the lemmings coming and I know I'm just a man&quot; with the Mellotron (one of the rare times 'tron was used on a VdGG album). This is truly not progressive rock for the faint of heart. So if you more prefer the mellow end of prog (i.e., the Moody Blues, Barclay James Harvest, PFM, Locanda Delle Fate), this might not be for you. And if you're a vinyl enthusiast like me, try getting the American LP copy on Charisma, as it features a totally killer bonus cut, &quot;Theme One&quot;. It's totally in your face with some of the greatest sax work you'll ever hear from David Jackson. That cut was not featured on the British release, since &quot;Theme One&quot; was released as a single there in 1972, not too long after Pawn Hearts was released. To me, I felt He to He and Pawn Hearts not only represented the best music of VdGG's career, but some of the best prog albums anywhere.
B00003CX5P|2.0|This movies expectations were WAY too high for starters. It wasn't ever going to be able to live up to the originals. I will agree that parts of the film were bad. The characters weren't very simpathetic, I saw no kids crying when Qui-gon died. They also spoiled alot of potential for the characters. Darth Maul and Qui-Gon would have been very interesting characters if we had recieved a little back story. If you ask anyone who their favorite character was, they say Darth Maul because he looks cool. Because he looks cool? Wow, they were really into what was happening emotionally with the character. Oh, yeah, Lucas didn't let us know about that. As for the storyline, it sounds like he wrote it over a weekend while he had a hangover. The dialogue was surprisingly horrible. The only intelligent speech actually came from the ultra annoying Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't funny!! Don't bring him back in Episode two!! I have all ready begun loosing faith in Episode two due to the title. &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; ? Someone is puffing the peace pipe too much. What is wrong with &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;? I will probably buy the DVD because, well, it's Star Wars. Also maybe the extra scenes will add a bit more depth to the characters(all though I strongly doubt it)
B000002BQK|5.0|This is one of my favorite Mariah albums. It contains ballads, RnB and anything you can request from Mariah. My favorite song on the album is \\"Whenever You Call\\", an AMAZING song, and one of Mariah's best, in my opinion. #1's like \\"Honey\\" and \\"My All\\" are beautiful as well. I like those songs like \\"Honey\\" and \\"Fantasy\\", they kinda cool. If \\"Daydream\\" and \\"Music Box\\" are Mariah's best albums to date, \\"Butterfly\\" could make a close match to them, pretty easily. You can really feel there has been put a lot of effort on it.
6304211740|1.0|Ok, first of all, the movie is totally unlike the book.  Secondly the acting was so, so BAD!  Hurt was the worst Rochester ever to walk the earth!  Gainsburg was OK as Janebut she didn't &quot;look&quot; the part.  Jane is supposed to be plain Gainsburg is just plain UGLY!  IT misses so many points in the book includeing the wonderful scene in wich Edward dresses up as a gypsy woman!  Also, the two leads do not seem to well how can I say this?  Connect.  Another thing one scene that truely disturbed me was the scene when Jane is Leaving Edward and Thornfeild begins to burn down.<BR>&quot;Mr. Rochester you'r house is up in flames and Jane way less that a mile away doesn't notice!&quot;<BR>Now tell me, if a house was going up in smoke right behind you would you notice.  I know, I know that scene is was made for &quot;Dramatic Affect&quot; but please!  I did like Anna Paquin as young Jane and the woman who played Mrs. Fairfax was perfect.  Over all the movie was OK I wouldn't recomend unless you like movies that are stupid and deserve to be banished from the world.  <BR>Thank You.
B00000G3PA|1.0|The makers of this movie thought that they could make a good movie just by using an infinite budget, excessive advertising campaign, employing fat, lazy, aging over-paid actors (not mentioning any names - Bruce Willis), and by totally copying and ripping-off a movie - \\"Deep Impact\\".<BR>Well they have failed miserably; they forgot that it takes - originality and imagination too. Also, very shallow, superficial and tacky.<BR>The 1 star goes to the Aerosmith soundtrack &amp; Aerosmith's frontman's daughter - Liv Tyler.<br />A shamefull rip-off...
B000000LZV|5.0|Read the other reviews here. Do you notice a trend?  How many other albums on Amazon are called the BEST?<br />There are many records that people love, but how many are called the BEST?  That group is a narrow pantheon of the most beloved records. Records that stand beyond genre and categorization. Records that changed lives.  This is one of those records.<br />This record changed my life when it came out on vinyl and I recently bought it on CD so I could listen to it in my car.  The record rocks.  It's full of great riffs, funky grooves, and thought provoking lyrics. It feels effortless and sounds like it was recorded over the course of a year at a high-end studio (instead of in a few weeks at a small recording studio).<br />I just read &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; by Michael Azzerad and he has a great chapter on the Minutemen.  I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in the legacy of the late 80's indie rock scene.<br />Get this record -- it's great.  It might change your life.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Either record company is trying to rip me off everytime they come with a new re-issue of old classics, or they are sincerely providing old fart rock and roll fan like me with more pieces of history. The fact is I have the vinyl, reg CD, expanded re-mix/master CD, and now.. I had to buy this after I heard on the radio that the COMPLETE Tommy was in. I was flabergasted when I bought the extra tracks Live at Leeds few years ago. It sounded raw, in your face and it was true rock and roll at its best. and they killed me once again with this. As I left Virgin Records 3 hours ago, the CD is in it's 2nd rotation. Once in my car.. I sat in my parking garage to hear the last note of.. We're not gonna take it/see me feel me. and in my living room. It rivals the Woodstock performance. It helps me get off the dreadful Bush speech that made me so depressed for uncertain future of America and well being of my children and my family. As an ex-guitarist I adore the Pete's raw and transient Gibson SG / Hiwatt Amp combo really shines. equipt only with occational fuzz box and natural echo of the Leeds Hall. Less all the hi-tech digital processing that kids today are used to. He knows how to put that sound with his fingers and the use of volume and tome controls. even the &quot;complex&quot; overture and subsequent well written/arranged opera numbers .. its hard to imagine it is accompanied by guitar bass and drum only. The dynamix of the songs .. Lets not forget the great Moon. Could almost feel .. no I really feel his stick hitting on those drum skins. especially climatic &quot;sparks&quot; ..<br />enuff said.. if they put out a complete CD of their Woodstock performance. (as they did for Jimi) I would get it. Check out the &quot;other&quot; Woodstock Performace on Kids are Alright Video.<br />PS. enuff said, let me go back to enjoy the CD&gt;. and tommorrow is a working day..<br />Long Live Rock.. I need it everyday.<br />Gene Johung/LA/CA/44

0767817486|4.0|This movie will have you gripped in suspense from start to finish: A (fairly) true story of an American college kid, William 'Billy' Hayes, trying to smuggle hashish out of Turkey, but getting caught and sentenced to life in a Turkish prison, serving a few (very tough) years before making a miraculous escape all the way back to the (good ole) USA.<br />Without a doubt, the director achieves a great feat of film making with this movie; you feel like you are right 'there', in Billy's shoes, as he tries to pass customs &amp; security to get on the plane with his undeclared goods, and right there in Turkey - you can almost smell the place.<BR>With godfathers of acting, such as John Hurt &amp; Randy Quaid, staring in this movie, it delivers action of an explosive and emotional calibre.<br />The only downside to the movie is that screenplay writer Oliver Stone blatantly adds some hypocritical fiction to the movie e.g. Billy being a strict heterosexual. Amazingly, he gets an Oscar for this desecration. Only in America I guess. If anyone deserves an Oscar it should have been the director.<br />Well, the movie is brilliant, but Oliver Stone's hypocritical screenplay has robbed the masterful director of a deserved 5 stars. Way to go Oliver.
B000002AP1|5.0|I'll have the guts to say it. If you don't like The Stooges, and especially if you don't like \\"Raw Power\\", then your musical opinion doesn't really add up to much. There is nothing else like this CD. Others have tried to come close, but nothing tops it. Not Black Sabbath, not John Coltrane, and not the even Beatles. This is not a case of false advertisement. The music contained on this disc is unbridled, freely released Raw Power. I can't believe that I went so many years of my life without this CD. I can't believe that this CD came out in 1973. (...and I can't believe that Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden produced this re-issue!)<br />The Stooges (along with MC5) started it all. Without them there would have been no Ramones, no Birthday Party, no Black Flag, no Clash, no punk. MC5 was first with the aggression, but The Stooges invented punk. To put is simply, if you say you like music... If you say that you are a music fan, and have diverse tastes... If you say that music defines who you are... then you MUST get this CD.  That's my opinion, anyway.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead has never done more than one album in the same style, when ok computer came out it was viewed as different, and less accessable than pablo honey or the bends, but theve gone even farther with kid a and amnesiac. All truey great bands do not tread the same path more than once, they progress and grow, and Radiohead is a great band. the above reviewer spoke of comparisons to pink floyd. Well its unavoidable, pink floyds experiments with sounds were revolutionary in 1967 and all of those techniques make pink floyd albums great, Radioheads experiments and neat atmospherics, will certainly continue to yeild music that is like nothing ever done before.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|Poor Shrek... all he wants is to be left alone, sadly for shrek the evil king has other ideas. With an abhorrence for any fairy tale creature the evil king has banished them all to another region... this region just happens to be Shrek's backyard. On a mission to clear his swamp of the excess baggage Shrek encounters a talking donkey (masterfully played by Eddie Murphy) an over romantic princess (played well by Cameron Diaz, even if her accent does tend to dissapear and reappear at the strangest moments) and a huge manage of other delightful characters.<BR>This movie is fabulous. The computer graphics are so real that they jump off the screen. The characters emotions, expressions and mannerisms are so real that you can't help but get involved and find them endearing and loveable. The cast it perfect, from Mike Myers to John Lithgow and the script is genius. This is a movie that you and your children will LOVE, your children will love the fairy tale characters and the animations and any adult will find the &quot;grown up&quot; humor to be hilarious. My only warning is that this isn't a movie (even though animated) for small children, they just won't get it. The dialogue is very adult and sometimes raunchy and even the animation won't make the story clear for small children. This movie had my family and I in stitches I guarantee it'll do the same for you, it is a total keeper and a great film for your collection.
B00003CXN4|4.0|I love this movie, and this dvd is a great representation of what I saw in the theatire with clear picture and sound, as well as a few nice extras...  The only reason i gave it a 4/5 is that I still feel kind of weird about laying down ($) for a 2 hour long anti-drug commercial.  Its a really REALLY good anti-drug commercial, but basically an anti-drug commercial nonetheless.<br />I felt so weird about it infact that I wasn't able to buy it for myself (especially after laying down ($) to see it in the theatre).  But I was given it as a gift and am very grateful... Sorry for the sort of mixed message but this is a very thought provoking movie and it tends to bring that out in people.
B00005N9CV|5.0|From the opening strains of the LA session orchestra, this album is S'Wonderful. Diana continues to improve with each and every recording; and, with her music already 5-star, that is quite unbelievable. The recording itself is very crisp and clear (listen for the triangle on &quot;I Remember You&quot;). The addition of orchestral accompaniment only adds to her sultry, smoooooth voice and piano playing. She has added Latin flavor with &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; and I can't imagine who could say 'no' to such a simply elegant song. The album closes with &quot;Maybe You'll Be There&quot; and my answer is there is no 'maybe' about it. Yes, yes, yes. This album is not only S'Wonderful, S'Marvelous!!!
B000002LKF|1.0|I'll try not to mention Graceland too often in this review. My one star review is not based on how unlike Graceland this sorry collection of dreary background music is. I understand what Paul Simon was trying to achieve with this album. Using South American musicians to create an ethnically-diverse collection sounds promising. It worked with the African and Cajun-filled Graceland album. The problem I have with this is that Rhythm Of The Saints lacks any memorable tracks, melodies or memorable lyrics. The lyrics are often self-indulgent and cryptic. The musical backings inexplicably often drown out Simon's vocals, which only adds to the misery. Mood music? To be judged as a whole album, creating an &quot;atmosphere&quot; rather than showcasing radio-friendly singles? Okay - I can accept that. I own several Latin-styled albums that are much more entertaining and listenable than this. Rhythm Of The Saints is, in comparison, dull and boring, a wasted opportunity. I had to play Jerry Lee Lewis after this to wake myself up.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Getting to sleep has been a challenge since Sept 11, but once I put Krall's newest CD in my player, her gentle and soothing music helped me drift away. Her choice of songs take me back to better times. The swaying bossa novas, the romantic strings, Krall's voice all combine for the ideal relaxing music for a romantic dinner or quiet evening reading and relaxing. There is something reassuring in these old fashioned love songs and the lush arrangements that accompany Ms. Krall. Nothing jars or confronts. The only surprise is that Krall sings &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; entirely in Spanish. The album has become my choice &quot;comfort music&quot; for these troubled times.
078401213X|5.0|To be perfectly honest, this is rather a review for the Pi that was playing in theatres, as it is unavailable on DVD in our cozy little island dwelling. Straight to the point, however, I really don't understand how this movie, in anyone's right mind, would qualify for a one? Possibly 3, if you aren't into art-house movies, but Pi's strongest aspect is simply how original it is, motioning away from conventional hollywood, particularly reinforced by the use of black and white in compilation with some rather amazing cinematography, which as a result allows the audience a glimpse of Max's total paranoia, regardless of whether you've memorized Pi to 180 digits..or not. And, true to all really effective films, we're left to fill in the gaps, and form our own interpretation regarding the possibility of a link between the stockmarket, mathematics and religion*
0441003257|3.0|I must admit I never got to appreciate Pratchett: to me, he seems to try hard to be the Douglas Adams of the fantasy genre, thus failing to find his own voice.<BR>Then we have Gaiman, who is the writer I love the most in the world - but who can't seem to be any good at writing novels as wonderful as his short stories or comics. (Note: this means his novels are just great, with Stardust possibly Most Great).<BR>Put the two together, and you get a very clever but basically &quot;normal&quot; humorous fantasy book. A few parts of it are very very nice, that's true, but it's basically &quot;Two nice guy doing Douglas Adams goes esoteric&quot;.<BR>If you want to laugh with Pratchett try &quot;Mort&quot;; if you want to be amazed by Gaiman get &quot;Stardust&quot; and if you want to really understand what a lousy writer you are, go for &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; by Gaiman. Unsurpassable.
B00005JKGI|5.0|...and quite a qood film too.  This could be considered Michael Caine's defining film.  He plays an ex-con, Charlie Croker, dapper, witty, charming, in that 60's suave manner that no-one's ever pulled off since.  The plot is fairly lightweight, he sets up a robbery with a computer virus to disable the Turin traffic lights and escape, but the joy of this film is in the character interaction.  Irene Handl is hysterically deadpan, and Benny Hill and his penchant for the fuller-figured woman (Big!  I likes em big!), what more can I say?  Throw in the most incredible car chase ever, this is not some CGI rubbish, this is real vehicles, and there is a scene where you see just how flimsy the equipment really is.  Noel Coward displays a wonderfully deadpan style which works with the air of general good-natured friendliness of this film.  Probably the only crime film I'd let my children see.
B00005NWM3|5.0|When I first heard &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; on the radio i was moved to buy this CD, and do you know what, it was one of the best decisions i could have made.  How you Remind Me is a great song, but i find a few others to be great on this CD.  &quot;Never Again&quot; is one of the best songs that i have ever heard, and Hollywood is right up there with some of the best grunge music that i have ever heard.  But my personal favorite track is #8 &quot;Where do i hide.  It has a great opening great lyrics, and towards the end it has a guitar solo that makes me think, &quot;God we need more instrumental solos in music today.&quot;  The only problem with this CD is that it is a little short, but i have no regrets what so ever for buying this CD.  It is easily one of the years top 10 releases, and i'd reccomend it to any one.
6301008960|5.0|In &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; Patrick Dempsey plays Ron, a high school nerd who Machiavellianly seizes a chance to become &quot;popular.&quot; He happens to bump into Cindy Mancini, the captain of the girls' cheerleading squad, at a moment when she is desperate for a quick thousand dollars -- an amount of money which he has on him, because he was on his way to buy himself an awesome new telescope. He arranges with her to pretend that they are a couple, in public, in return for which he will bail her out of her predicament. They shake hands on the deal, and things start getting weird immediately.<br />This is really a pretty nice movie. Ron shows the magic of being a nerd -- he takes Cindy on a date to an old airplane graveyard, where he regales her with stories about the histories of the old planes. He knows the geography of the lunar surface as though it were the back of his hand, which is kind of a cool thing to be clued into. Basically, he really is a pretty interesting guy. HOWEVER... the more popular he becomes, (due to Cindy's charm rubbing off on him), the more of a scumbag he gets to be. He doesn't even seem to realize that Cindy actually falls in love with him for his real self, he's so caught up with trying to be someone he's not. If he had remained the Astro-nerd he really was, right from the beginning, he would have had a lot more self respect. In that case, of course, there would have been no movie, so maybe we're all lucky that he chose to temporarily alter his customary modus vivendi.<br />This movie has real heart. A lot of 80s movies were pretty fluffy, but this one actually makes you think. It sticks to your ribs, that's all I can tell you. This next part of my review might sound a little tangential, but if you see the movie you'll see that it's actually extremely relevant...  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; makes you really think about a lot of things that happen in high school.  That's why it's so powerful.  I found myself preoccupied at some points with how little energy people in the high school portrayed expend thinking about science, or ideas, or foreign lands, or history, which at least in theory should be the whole point of school.  Or, to put in another way -- Ron's smart, nerdy friends actually DO think about such things, but generally outside of the academic environment.  The social pressures of the experience of being in school are so overwhelming for Ron, at times, that sometimes he can barely even THINK, let alone LEARN.   Without his cerebral, escapist daydreams of the moon's geography (lunography?), it seems that his mind and spirit would have been crushed altogether.  Ahhhh, institutionalized education.  You've gotta love it -- NOT!   Makes you think, I guess.<br />But back to the movie. &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; has two overriding themes. First, &quot;to thine own self be true.&quot; I, for one, was WELL into my twenties before the first time I let myself BE myself enough to go ahead and buy a telescope, rather than spending the money trying to impress someone. The younger you are when you start being yourself, the better off you'll be. Second, don't be such a heinous, evil fiend to the other people you are trapped in school with for four years. Even nerds have a lot to say, a lot to offer, etc. This is a really good movie, almost a fable in some ways. I recommend the living daylights out of it. Also -- if you like this movie, you might also enjoy &quot;Lucas,&quot; or &quot;Dazed and Confused.&quot; Two thumbs up.
B000056K04|5.0|I never really got into these guys until this CD and after hearing this one, I had to go buy a previous album!  I like the mixture of music they use.  I listen to it all the time!
B00005MAM2|3.0|The beginning is quite a visual treat. The characters(at least) a majority of them actually look Japanese. The film doesn't make sense towards the end. It's kinda weird. I don't like films I can't interpret. I like conclusive endings with some a assurance of an ending or sequel. The withered children give me the creeps. I thought the boy was a zombie. At first I thought Akira was some movie about some brats altered by nuclear destruction. That boy did look like a monstrosity. But it is a nice change of pace. I just wish the plot was more clear.It reminded me of some films I saw involving world devastation. But it's alright.
B00000J7SO|2.0|This is probably the only album in Dylan's catalogue I can't stand (aside from, of course, SAVED - but that's a given for most).  I don't know what it is...the use of female backup singers, the tepid big band instrumentaion, or Dylan's tired-sounding vocals.  There are some decent songs here, but they're marred by poor delivery.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have very few Jazz albums in my collection, but when I started diving into this genre, this was the first one I got. It's so perfect, so intimate, so full of spirit... and there are two qualities to it that make it even more impressing:<br />-First, the musical framework to it was conceived by Davis (as explained by pianist Bill Evans in the inner-sleeve) barely hours before the recording took place. Based off this framework, the band that accompanied him played all except one of the five pieces in one 'take.'<br />-Second, this album was recorded in 1959, and it still sounds as fresh and penetrating today as it did back then. This is a quality that only true masterpieces can achieve: stand the test of time.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden's &quot;Affirmation&quot; is so touching, so stirring, so completely different from every other pop CD I've ever heard. The sweet simplicity of the vocals, the meaning in the lyrics, the seriousness of the piano-based melodies all blend together to create one of the finest boy band CDs of all time.<br /> From the light, quirky &quot;Affirmation&quot; to the gentle, delicate &quot;I Knew I Loved You,&quot; this CD offers something for everyone. The thoughtful &quot;Two Beds and A Coffee Machine&quot; (Possibly the most outstanding of the album) to the musing &quot;Animal Song&quot; up to the apologetic charm of &quot;I Don't Know You Anymore,&quot; the CD offers an exceptional quality of music as well as a pleasant listening experience.
B000002GFC|5.0|This compilation contains the most comprehensive sample of the work of this 60s superband made of Ginger Baker (Drums), Jack Bruce (Bass) and guitar God, Eric Clapton. Besides, the booklet tells the story &quot;behind the music&quot; of the CD. It's an ideal starting place for those who are new to the work of the band.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|When the first version came out and contained NO extras, lots of folks assumed there was a second act to follow...and here it is.  This thing is super-loaded with everything but the kitchen sink.  Although the new film content alone is worth the price of admission.  Support this film and support Cameron Crowe.  Not only is he one of the great guys in the business, but he doesn't make enough movies - and it doesn't help when the announcer at the Golden Globes introduces Cameron's leading man as the star of &quot;Vanilla Ice&quot; when it's really &quot;Vanilla Sky.&quot;  Whoops!
B000000WFZ|5.0|From the days of &quot;A Fistful Of Dollars&quot; and &quot;The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly&quot; up to &quot;Cinema Paradiso,&quot; &quot;Malena,&quot; and this album, to name a few, the maestro Ennio Morricone has had a place in sountrack composition that can only be paralleled by a few such as John Williams and perhaps James Horner.<br />&quot;The Mission&quot; is the music to the 1986 blockbuster hit of the same name, starred by Jeremy Irons and Robert De Niro. It provides an excellent and eclectic musical background to the dramatic story, but it's solid enough to stand out by itself alone. It's definitely one of my favorite soundtrack albums in my 900+ CD collection.
0517122707|5.0|Do you have one of those friends that always seems to be getting themselves into the strangest situations?  That is just a bit - off?  This book allows us to follow an oafish, irritable, hilarious, charming, clueless man as he makes his way from adventure to adventure, job to job.  Our hero, Iganacious, has an opinion about EVERYTHING - his jobs, the people he meets, his mother, his bloated body.  The normal parts of life - taking a cab, stopping for a bite to eat, shopping - are always fodder for a funny episode with Ignacious.<br />This book is charming.  It is funny.  It is easy to read.  Even though Ignacious is truly a horrible guy - everything he touches seems to lead to problems for other people - you can't help but laugh and enjoy his company.  Whether he is leading factory workers on a strike that ends in nothing more substantial than a broken flower pot, or whether he is crashing and ruining a ladies' auxiliary art show, Ignacious always seems to find the world not quite as he expects it to be.  As each new day starts, you find yourself wondering &quot;what next?&quot;  As you turn the pages, you're never sure what new funny adventure he'll lead you on.  The writing is crisp and fun, and you will immediately tumble into the twisted, convoluted, bizarre, obscene, cracked up world that Ignacious lives in.  You'll even start thinking like he does a bit if you aren't careful.<br />This book is fun - FUN! - and a quick read.  It well deserves the Pulitzer it received.  It's a hidden gem.  Catch it!
B000002NJS|5.0|After practically having grown up to the music of Madonna, I was very used to the fact that she was the queen of Pop, but I would have never expected her to come up with such a brilliant dance/ambient album, like &quot;Ray of Light.&quot;<br />This time around, the diva counted with the production of William Orbit, considered precursor/father along with other greats (such as Brian Eno) of the Ambient musical movement. As a result, the album stands out above all of Madonna's previous work, as more soulful, more intimate, yet still retaining the essential Madonna feel to it: totally danceable and contagious. Also to be considered as an element deeply affecting the quality of this album, is her motherhood, which becomes apparent in the more mature nature of the lyrics.<br />There's not a single track on it I don't like: it's one of those perfect albums.
0671027573|3.0|I was converted to Linda Howard with &quot;All the Queen's Men&quot; and &quot;Son of the Morning&quot;.  This is not nearly on the same caliber scale.  The story line is fast paced, yes, but it's a little contrived.  Also, the leaps and bounds that supercede logic are disappointing...definitely not one of her best.
B000002GLE|5.0|This live album by Sting (watch for the new one coming out on November 2001) is trully a musical statement and a masterpiece. By combining his composing and singing talents with the musical talents of a top notch band of musicians which at the time were already highly respected in the world of jazz, for the most part, Sting has achieved a solid double-album that lacks nothing, and has lots to offer to both the casual Sting listener and to the hardcore Sting fan.<br />To give you a feel of what you can expect to find, I invite you to listen to his version of The Police song, &quot;I Burn For You.&quot; It says it all...
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I have almost completely forsaken pop-music (as a cloying, bubble-gum toy of happy teens, its greatest value is the indication of &quot;our&quot; collective mindset), but Manu Chao revives the concept. Man /Woman, you have to love him if nothing else, then for his comment on the <BR>wall they're building to protect the Holy European Fortress from all those dark, moneyless refugees from down there (being one of them, i sing clandestino quite often).

B000002KKC|5.0|Without a doubt. . . the strangest, most obnoxious, ridiculous, and make no mistake, the most brilliant pop album of the late 1970's, Fleetwood Mac's TUSK is just a marvel. The album sounds like an overproduced collection of basement recordings, interspersed with the occasional Rumours-esque production flair. You have to wonder just where everybody's head was, what they were thinking, how they managed to record something as marvelous as this. Though FLEETWOOD MAC and RUMOURS both offered a very cohesive, lush, enjoyable sound and mood that is regarded as the &quot;classic&quot; FM sound, it was really TUSK that first showed what each member was really all about, and similarily formed the blueprint for the rest of their careers, with and without the band. You have Christine effortlessly penning ear candy like &quot;Honey Hi&quot; and &quot;Never Forget,&quot; showing her vulnerability with &quot;Never Make Me Cry&quot; and &quot;Think About Me,&quot; and even getting a teensy bit sensual, on the teriffic &quot;Brown Eyes.&quot; Then there's Stevie, juggling between welsh witch ruminations (&quot;Sisters Of The Moon&quot;) and just pouring her soul into her music (&quot;Beautiful Child,&quot; &quot;Storms&quot;). And. . . and then there's Lindsey Buckingham, finally proving that he is indeed the funked up genius his old hairstyle suggested, with his pieces that owe nods to both Brian Wilson and Frank Zappa, with a bit of Kingston Trio in for good measure. It's his eccentricity that dominates the album, and boy are we all the better for it. The production is crisp, a little dirty, but each instrument shines clear as a whistle. Fleetwood Mac sort of retreated in light of TUSK's relative failure, returning to a RUMORS-esque sound on their next release, but things had changed. What remains is TUSK, a brilliant album that will play to each and every one of your emotions, and have you singing right along the whole time. What are you waiting for? Go buy it!!
0425170349|5.0|It is scary how this man writes, and then his words come true.  In real life, events of September 11, 2001, have prompted governments to form a coalition to fight terrorism around the world.  Yet Tom Clancy talked about such an effort years before this happened.  As seen in real life, the dangers of terrorism in the air and on the ground are horrifying, but one man, having done extensive research, writes about how a war against evil can be fought.  Let's hope another part of Tom Clancy's literary premonitions comes true... after all, he does have the good guys winning the fight.  Read this, &quot;Debt of Honor,&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders,&quot; and you'll understand why he's &quot;the king of the technothriller&quot; and an amazing soothsayer.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I stumbled upon Diana Krall by accident watching TV one day. Then I saw &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; and bought it. I popped it into the CD player in the car while driving home and had to pull over it take it in it was so good. This woman is a great talent and I was glad to see that she won her Grammy last year for that masterpiece. Now &quot;The Look Of Love&quot; is out and I just bought it the other day. I can honestly say that without a doubt...she has just won herself another grammy. Its a lock. Her voice and masterful piano playing are wonderful and the jazz crew she has behind her are amazing as well. Diana, if your reading this...you are a treasure. Thank you.
0783225849|5.0|Done on a low budget, using the crew from his TV show, and in black and white--people probably thought that Hitch was mad.  Well, this is one of the all-time greats of the horror/suspense genre, and it still gives me the shivers, even after many, many viewings!<br />Joseph Stefano's script, based on Robert Bloch's novel, doesn't let up.  Bernard Herrmann's music is nervous, edgy and driving, adding another dimension and reinforcing all of the nuances of the film.  The print is excellent--crisp and sharp, and the sound is equally so.<br />The cast is excellent--especially Anthony Perkins as the nervous Norman Bates, who just happens to have a slight problem with his &quot;mother&quot; (who &quot;isn't quite herself&quot;).<br />All of the extras on the DVD are worth the price--the documentary THE MAKING OF 'PSYCHO,'trailers, newsreel footage of the opening, posters, lobby cards, and, in an interesting comparison, the famous &quot;shower scene&quot; with and without music.<br />Watch it alone--if you dare!
B00005N9CV|2.0|I really wanted to like this CD.  I think Ms. Krall has done some wonderful work in the past and has brought a lot to jazz vocal music.  Unfortunately, this one will probably just end up in my stack of &quot;mood music&quot;.  Here are some pros and cons:<br />Pros:  Good vocal intonation; Very tasteful drums from Peter Erskine<br />Cons:  A sea of same-ness in arrangements; I wish I could get a version without the orchestra (Everything sounds like a &quot;beautiful music&quot; radio station); Effects used on her voice a bit annoying; The photos (Is this a pro or con?  She looks great - maybe too great - the dress, the legs, the shoes -- everything.  But I'd rather see much more focus on the music than the looks when I spend my money on CDs); I wish she had opened up on her piano playing a lot more.<br />So, while I wish her all the best, this particular CD didn't do much for me.  I will purchase her next CD hoping that she varies the arrangements a little more, keeps Peter Erskine around, uses fewer vocal effects, and gets rid of the orchestra.
B000002MJ0|5.0|&quot;Isn't Anything&quot; is different. Different from what? - &quot;Loveless&quot; of course, but it's hard to pinpoint where in why it is different. These are the exact same people playing and singing, the same label. Budgets are considerably lower, i guess; especially in the case of MBV it could mean that the record is terrible, but it is not - it is just very very different. To a &quot;Loveless&quot;-trained ear (and there are a lot of &quot;Loveless&quot;-trained ears) it will sound very atonal. But the scariest thing is that it sounds very atonal even to a Sonic Youth-trained ear! Trust me, i own almost all of the SY back catalogue (plus even weirder extras...) and i considered shelving &quot;Isn't Anything&quot; after the first listen. I was afraid of listening to it again for two weeks, but when i finally did - gorgeousness! - i understood that it is a work of genius and not a miserable debut of a clueless young band, as i thought at first. Granted, it may sound very un-ripe at times, but compared to Loveless what won't?<br />The highlights are &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; that starts with out-of-tune guitars and ends with quite literally breathtaking &quot;ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooooh&quot;'s (&quot;Blown a Wish&quot; comes to mind) and &quot;Sueisfine&quot; which sounds like something that Sonic Youth recorded for &quot;EVOL&quot;, but deleted because Steve Shelley was drunk.<br />Important remark - unlike &quot;LL&quot; which is a very speakers-oriented record, &quot;Isn't Anything&quot; is much better in headphones.

0060977264|4.0|I've noticed very extreme ratings from 1 star to 5 stars given to this book.<br />This book forces the reader to think about some pertinent issues in life: do we quietly accept or burdens? Or do we fight to change our dull boring lives? Should we let ourselves be mired in habit or should be seek a wonder-filled life?<br />It does seem a touch too chauvinistic - Pilar's friend is too much the perfect guy, the romantic spiritual teacher who teaches her about the meaning of life - but right at the end of the book, the author has redeemed Pilar by letting show her friend some very important things about love.<br />People will rate this book according to whethere or not they agree with the author on these issues, but I rate this work 4 stars anyway for its unusual romantic storyline, and the writing, which is laudable. <br />Read the book. Even if you don't like the author's ideas, you should still ponder the themes relating to life, acceptance and love of the novel. Without this book to open our eyes, many people might just pass through life without ever noticing these issues.
B00000FCBC|1.0|Metallica, or Electra, stopped putting out the original Garage Days Re-Revisited, which was put out in '87.  For no other reason than they must need even more money, Metallica puts this thing out that shows their progression from putting out some incredible stuff, to slowing down and sounding like a washed up version of Motorhead.  In addition, they removed Am I Evil and Blitzkreig from Kill Em All, for what reason I don't know, and slapped them on here.  Do you smell something fishy?
B000005QH3|5.0|great movie! it takes me back to the early 70's like no other movie has. one of the best car chases on film ever. all star cast at their best accompanied by a supreme sound track. if you like great music, awesome cars, and a fast paced exciting movie, this video is for you!
0399146253|2.0|Okay. I read books while riding an exercise bike in the morning before I go to work. If it is a good read, I'll pick up where I left off reading when I return home. In the past, Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series has often been that type of book. But . . . not this time. The padding (and lack of a courageous editor) is obvious. Kay's repeated musings about &quot;poor me&quot; and inward entreaties became tiresome within the first 50 pages, yet the pattern continued to repeat throughout. The whining about personal relationships got so bad that I thought I was reading Elizabeth George! Also, every short trip, whether by car, SUV or helicopter in and about the Richmond vicinity could not pass without detailed, trivial, irrelevant descriptions of cars, scenery, etc., little of which added to the story. PLEASE, Ms Cornwell, quit cannibalizing your old books for plot lines and characters, and concentrate on your story (if you have one).
B000003TA4|5.0|Though there were bands that were as good (if not better) that preceded them on the Seattle alt-rock scene, let's face it, Nirvana brought alt-rock out of the underground and into the mainstream.  Before Nirvana, alt-rock was tucked in to the bowels of the Seattle underground and college campuses.  Nirvana begat a music revolution from which I'm still recovering.<br />I've often been accused of overstating the case, but this album gave a voice to a generation that at the time was struggling to find its identity.  It gave generation of people looking for something to hold onto and call its own just that.<br />Kurt Cobain's life mirrored his art.  He was gone a very short time later and (as is its wont) the music scene shifted away from alt-rock.  Though it tried its best to hang on, alt-rock just wasn't the same without its reluctant leader.<br />This album sums it all up.  It's first single, the driving &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, is full of angst, screaming about a world that is boring and useless to the teen spirit it speaks to.  &quot;Come As You Are,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; &quot;Breed,&quot; and &quot;On A Plain&quot; all serve to further drive home the point.  The point is that we are a generation, not bound to the ideals of our parents and their parents, but free to determine our own path and fate.  And we are here to deal with the consequences as they come.<br />This is a must for anyone between the ages of 22-31.  True 1990's genius.
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA's Liquid Swords is by far one of the most powerful albums of all time.  Everything works together perfectly -- RZA's eerie, disturbing beats, GZA's dark, ominous lyrics -- to create a musical experience unlike any other.  This album is a must for anyone (even those who don't enjoy hip-hop music) looking for a deep, insightful piece of art.  Be forewarned though: this album is extremely dark and disturbing, and may very well take you to places you never wanted to visit.  That said, if you can handle it, Liquid Swords may very well become the centerpiece of your music collection.
B00004XOWN|1.0|I used to have some respect for Fred, back in the Three Dollar Days - where the guitars actually had a prominent piece of the action. Those were the good ol' days.... back then....<br />All I can ask now is, what HAPPENED to him? Does Durst honestly think we want to hear him scream the F word 50 times in one track?? What's he trying to be, another Insane Clown Posse? Then he has the nerve to insult other bands that \\"don't match his style\\". His punch on Nine Inch Nails was really uncalled for. They're metal, he's ....<br />Heck, even the album's title [stinks]. It has no meaning, no reason, and it's too long.<br />The pathetic thing is that the rest of the band has huge potential! Wes Borland scored among the top ten best guitarists in the COUNTRY. And yet, he is stuck in a band run by someone who practically pirated his way into Interscope.<br />All in all, Durst is ... now. CSATHFW is a pure waste of talent on the band's part, and shows the lack of talent from Fred.

B00005KFUM|5.0|After Muse had to put up with the critism of being just another Radiohead wannabe after their first album 'Showbiz' they can finaly be reassured that this is not the case and they have delivered one of the best albums of the year so far.  Although the only way of describing this is a progressive rockpra which takes an equal mix of Raidioheads early stuff as an influence with freddie mercury's screeching voice.  The opening track is by far the best and these fellas really no how to play their guitars.  Even if you dont like Muse that much you can still listen and smile at the lead singers hillariously high pitched singing
B00003CXSP|4.0|Anthony Hopkins does it once again!  As always he's wonderful in this film.  Julianne Moore is exceptional and does a good job as Agent Starling.<br />The only thing I did't like about the DVD is  this ~  &quot;The Director's&quot; cut out things that should have been left in the film.  On the second DVD (that comes in this package) you will see the snip's that were left out of the film. They should for the most part have been left in the film and the DVD shoud be re-done and put back!  Those snips matter to this film.  <br />If I had to watch it for the first time again, I think I'd look at the second DVD first then watch the &quot;movie&quot;.  <br />All in all, it's a keeper.
B0000057C5|5.0|This is a great album, and I don't seem to tire of hearing it. Ironically, their radio hit &quot;Du Hast&quot;, is probably the lamest song on the album. (Not that it's lame, just that it under-performs the rest of the album.)  Rammstein has a unique, hard-driving, techno/metal sound that appeals to a number of people I know who have otherwise completely different tastes in music.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Exery Song on this CD is wonderful~  I was am so glad that I ordered this.  Diana did an increadable putting this CD together.  This is a MUST HAVE CD~  <br />I just wish the CD was &quot;longer&quot;.  Thumbs up here Diana~  Love her voice, and she just keeps getting &quot;better and better&quot;~  <BR> <BR>You won't be sorry for buying this CD, it's a Keeper~
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein's best effort to date (and apparently their first?). I love this album. It's a little harder than &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, but not drastically different. Those who liked the pace and intensity of &quot;Engel&quot; and &quot;Tier&quot; will love &quot;Herzeleid&quot;.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Where did this guy come from?  What an incredible voice.  What incredible songwriting.  What incredible guitar playing!  In my opinion, each and every song is a true 'keeper'.  They all are different.  Not like on some freshman efforts when you get tired of the CD half the way through becauseit seems as if you have heard the same song over and over...  and over again!  John Mayer's voive sounds a little like Michael Frank's.  It sounds a little like Willy Porter.  It sounds a lot like John Mayer.  People need to hear this.  I just can't say that enough.  I am lending it to everyone I know but the word needs to be spread.  GREAT work, John.  Can't wait for your next one!
B00005NP04|5.0|Outstanding music, an excellent collection of hits and new material.  This is a must own....
B0000028P8|5.0|When I bought MTV Unplugged:EP I never figured it would be a lot different from her album version of the same songs (excluding &quot;I'll be there&quot;) but it actually was.  Mariah's voice is very beautiful and she uses her whole vocal range on all of her songs.  Critics claimed she couldn't sing live but she proved them wrong.  She sounds very warm and accepting on this live album and her voice is just amazing.  Her track &quot;I'll be there&quot; is a remake of the Jackson 5's original hit.  It's one of my favorite songs of all time.  Mariah re sings all of her other songs and they sound perfect.  She has talent that has carried her far.
0375703861|5.0|This book tries to tackle so many things, but really it is about the English immigrant experience, the inexorable pull of place, and the burden of family history. Her writing reminded me a lot of John Irving's, and certainly was as funny as some of his best work. I laughed out loud many times.
B0000024W3|1.0|A. This album blows. Hard. B. Dylan wanted it that way.<BR>Come on people, this is not Bob Dylan delivering art. He was trying to alienate the &quot;Woodstock Nation&quot; that was encroaching on his existence. So he released a DOUBLE ALBUM of the most badly recorded (Quinn the Eskimo), uninspired (Like a Rolling Stone, he forgets the words to most of one of the verses and repeats &quot;As you stare into the vacuum...&quot; 5 TIMES), poorly written (Cooper Kettle), incoherent (All the Tired Horses, Days of 49, Blue Moon, Wigwam on the same album?), and botched covers (The Boxer out of tune and out of time, with double vocal tracks, and that country song with the sloppy intro and modulation), excessively lush strings (Dylan knew strings would ruin his songs, or the &quot;Pioneer lad/bad&quot; intro) and material that probably just didn't make the cut, for good reason, on JWH or Nashville Skyline. And painted the cover art in five minutes. If you find this album to have any redeeming qualities, beyond the breadth and execution of Dylan's joke, I'm sorry. IT WAS INTENTIONALLY BOTCHED IN AS DIVERSE A FASHION AS DYLAN COULD THINK OF. (oh yeah, and what's up with the Rooster photo on the gatefold?)
0137549202|4.0|This book has its share of shortcomings, but overall, it is probably the best and most complete reference on DSP.  Unfortunately, it does skip a few important topics.  For example, the second edition threw out the section on designing IIR bandpass and highpass filters from lowpass prototypes.  This section used to be in the first edition and is VERY important, so I don't see how Oppenheim &amp; Schafer could have justified throwing it out.  They also conspicuously left out filter design based on the frequency sampling method.  But in spite of these omissions, it's hard to recommend another book over this one.  The one that comes closest is Mitra's.<br />In the end, if you want to learn DSP and work in the field, you have to have this book, as well as the ones by Mitra, Proakis &amp; Manolakis, Jackson, and, of course, Rabiner &amp; Gold.  If you get all those, you'll have the complete reference of CORE DSP texts.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I was really, really, really dissapointed. Jar-Jar, 2 lines of dialogue from Darth Maul, Anakin accidently blowing up almost all the bad guys, and THE FORCE actually being little bugs that control things. Add that to the astounding coincidences. Anakin built C3P0, who will apparently forget about Anakin and Obi-Wan by Episode IV. Obi-Wan will also forget about R2-D2, who saved him and others by repairing the ship. I won't go on lest I annoy myself more.<BR>It was the most complete and total shattering of everything about the previous movies that I held dear. As for this being for the kids, bollocks to that. The first three movies, particularly Empire, were dark, witty, lively, and just plain fun. I can still watch them today without ever wincing in pain at a line of dialogue like &quot;Exsqueeze me!&quot; Thank you Jar Jar.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I'm 13. I thought this CD was awesome, same with what I think of Conspiracy of One(which i also own).  My friend has this and showed me it so I knew it was great.  I went to amazon.com and looked on the 30 second preveiws.  Listened to &quot;Why Don't You Get a Job?&quot; was excellent, when the 30 seconds ended I knew I had to get it.<br />I suggest this to ANY offspring fans and everyone who likes punk.  It's awesome.
1565113306|5.0|Aw geez, just read the damn book.  If you've heard anything about it, it's peaked your interest, buy it.  <BR>Or just buy it so Chuck can continue to write full time and provide us with more brutally clever commentary on the sad state of America's plague of consumerism. The accomplishment of his first-person narrative is damn impressive. The narrator is to Holden Caulfield  what &quot;Falling Down&quot; is to &quot;Bartleby the Scrivener.&quot;
B000002JPA|4.0|1992, you had &quot;Nevermind&quot; and a poor Red Hot Chilli Pepper's album a year before but that album had &quot;Under The Bridge&quot; on it so is considered there best album, well that song is an anthem, also you had Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; album, Rage Against The Machine's self titled album, and you had this album.<br />Now Images And Words did get recognition but not as much as the above mentioned simply because they try to hard.  Listen to &quot;Metropolis Part 1&quot; and you know that a great song has been ruined because too much musicianship was put into it and it is not satisfying to the ear.  Tempo changes here, crescendo's there, what makes a good album is structure and the album's highlight's include &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, &quot;Another Day&quot; &quot;Surrounded&quot;, &quot;Take The Time&quot; and &quot;Learning To Live&quot;.<br />With the album ender &quot;Learning To Live&quot; it is a 13 minute song that has the ability to sound better every time you listen to it, the first time I heard this song I thought that it was a poor way to end an emotionally intense album, but it takes time, and time worth spent.<br />&quot;Another Day&quot; is probably the most powerful song on the album as when the song hits the 2 minute mark, this bridge comes in and I wouldn't be surprised if a tear came to your eye.<br />The concept of the album is Death, love and loss and if you are into prog metal then this is as good as any Iced Earth, Queensryche album out there, however, my critic is that recognition is everything, otherwise you'll be a forgotten band, I'm not a fan of Dream Theater, but in a 100 years time I don't think anyone will be a fan either.  Some music last and some don't.<br />I put as a header, the music revolution starts here, well, if anyone can put this to a more structered and memorable form, then that band will be remembered and get recognition.<br />Otherwise Dream Theater will need to die in an aeroplane crash to be remembered (reference to Lynerd Skynerd).
B0000019PA|5.0|Just a fascinating record...you get the feeling that this was done in a living room on a 4-track recorder, and I don't think I'd have it any other way.  There are a lot of people complaining about the production or level of performance on this, and I don't understand how someone could be so clueless.  What do you want?  48-track digital sound?  Mariah Carey?  Would that make you feel better?<br />This record is so pure and genuine that it just makes me want to cry.  These are the songs I wish I'd written.  Best record ever?  Probably not, but I can't seem to get it out of my CD-player.
B00004U8P4|3.0|Jurassic Park was a behemoth blockbuster of epic proportions. This one was too. But, Still, there was a sense of magic that the first one had and this one didn't. Don't get me wrong, it's still a fun ride. Jeff Goldblum returns and finds out that Richard Attenborough has sent a crew to his dinosaur island. Goldblum realizes that his girlfriend Sara(Julianne Moore) is one of those people. He sets out on a rescue mission to the island to get his girlfriend out of there. His little daughter tags along for the ride. Why didn't he mention he had a daughter in the first movie?. Anyways, things go wrong when they arrive and he too is stuck on the island with a new group of dinosaur poachers. The movie, like the first, has amazing, eye popping effects. The dinosaurs are very, very real. The action scenes are fun and entertaining. The end climax in San Diego was hilarious and fun. But, I keep getting this feeling that there was something missing. Jeff Goldblum is solid as usual. The daughter storyline was odd and didn't seem to fit. What was the point of that?. Anyways, it's a decent film, but doesn't hold a candle to the brilliant original.
B000002GK1|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect when i got it the other day. I have from &quot;Superunknown&quot; on, so when i popped it in my ole cd player boy was i amazed. The first song Rusty Cage has this weird guitar sound at the first of it, so from then on i was hooked.I don't know how many times i've listened to it so far, but it just grabs you in and takes you for that great ole grunge ride. If you like Soundgarden or just want to know what grunge really was, buy this album.
B000003S5H|5.0|This album, which I heard after &quot;10,000 Hz Legend&quot; made my thoughts about Air secure.  They are very talented artists, and I highly recommend this CD.  I had heard &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; before I heard the whole album, and so my view is probably a little biased.  &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; is a great song with a catchy rhythm and well, is pretty damned sexy, heh, just kidding.  &quot;You Make it Easy&quot;, &quot;All I Need&quot;, and some of the other tracks have female vocals, but they still have the distinct Air style.  This has a bit heavier sound than their other album, Premiers Symptones.  I first heard Air through &quot;the virgin suicides&quot; movie soundtrack, where their &quot;playground love&quot; has stuck with me.  Still, I highly suggest you buy this CD if you like Zero 7 or cool, ambient, not strict electronica, music.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|True, this cd doesn't have all great songs on it.  But at least it has some of the biggest songs like &quot;Come What May&quot; and &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Nature Boy.&quot;  Hopefully they will release a &quot;More Music From Moulin Rouge&quot; including the &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; song and &quot;Like a Virgin.&quot;  Anyways, I was so excited to get it since I am a huge fan... I even downloaded the sheet music for &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Come What May&quot; from musicnotes.com the other day... great soundtrack.
B00005BJPO|2.0|Have you ever noticed how nobody in anime stories ever wins? Especially not the good guys. Massively depressing with a sound trak that is so ominous that it alone is enough to make you double your Prozac.
B000001FXR|5.0|I guess by now it's been well documented that this is the record that brought The Wailers to worldwide fame, and brought Reggae music to the rest of the world while enhancing the mainstream birth of a Legend, and that is for obvious reasons.<BR>The record starts with classic Reggae tracks like &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;Slave Driver&quot; and moves on to other great songs like &quot;Kinky Reggae&quot; and The Classic, &quot;Stir It Up&quot;, which has been recognized by many as a masterpiece of seduction.<BR>The harmony of the wailers is outstanding on this record, including Bob Marley's One of a kind Vocals and lyrics. But the music in the record Benefits greatly by The Rhythm section of the Barret brothers, and also Peter Tosh's guitar playing, which gives the album more of a Rock Edge, with his guitar Solos.<BR>This is a reggae classic like no other, and Powerfull album as well.
B000021YQV|5.0|I think this album produces what is great in the metal scene. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the opener prison song to the end aerials.]<br />1. Prison song- A great opener for an album. Very lively. 9/10<BR>2. Needles- The best song on the album. Very catchy tune. 10/10<BR>3. Deer Dance- Another great song. 9/10<BR>4. Jet Pilot- What a song. You never know what comes next in this song. It changes from a punk song into a kind of eastern tune. 10/0<BR>5.X- A good song. A bit too short. 8/10<br />6.Chop Suey- The single. Great song another one of my favourites. 10/10<BR>7. Bounce- A very quirky song. Its very good but a bit short. 9/10<BR>8. Forest- Brilliant song. 10/10<BR>9. Atwa- The srecond best song on the album 10/10<BR>10. Science- The worst song on the album. A bit boring. 7/10<BR>11. Shimmy- The song is very good. A great jazzy bit in the middle. Again to short. 9/10<BR>12. Toxicity- A great great great song. A classic. 10/10<BR>13. Psycho- Another good song. Lively. 8/10<BR>14. Aerials- A great way to end the operfect album. 10/10<br />Altogether the greatest album for a few years.
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers is a detailed and personal account of the experiences of the 101st Screaming Eagles' Easy Company as they fight across fortress Europe. This book is not an history lesson, nor is it guide to WWII tactics and strategy. It is a true story collected from the yarns of Easy Company survivors that tells the tale of citizen soldiers and their experiences as they battle the Nazi menace. Ambrose is in top form as he organizes and puts to pen the tragedies and victories of Easy Company. Watch the HBO series if you want, but READ THIS BOOK.
B000059PR5|5.0|Sept 20, 2001,<BR>I saw this film on TV years ago...Taped it, but can't find my tape.  At this time, shortly after 911, and as our president and military forces consider our options and tactics, I can't help but remember this film and how World War III in this film started with a conflict with the Middle East.<BR>BUY IT!
B00005NP04|5.0|You will love this CD!!  What more could you ask for than all of Martina McBride's hits on one CD?  This includes 14 smash hits, and 4 new songs which are definitely going to be hits, including &quot;When God-Fearin' Women Get the Blues.&quot;  I saw Martina live in concert twice with Reba, and she is one of the BEST country artists out there!!  The upbeat love songs are sung very sincerely.  The songs that deal with issues such as poverty and abuse are very heartfelt and sad, but wonderfully sung.  The only thing I would change is to add &quot;It's My Time&quot; to this CD.  Other than that, I have absolutely NO complaints!!
B00005LQ04|5.0|I just want to say that the transfer quality is amazing.  There is a sense of texture in the images that tape does not convey.<BR>The second DVD is very helpful in explaining a bit about the symbolism that might otherwise go unrecognized.  Having excerpts of the Goblin score re-mixed is a revelation.  Also, the discussion helps put &quot;Suspiria&quot; in the context of horror films of the past that have inspired Argento.<BR>Recommended for serious film lovers and collectors.
B00005N9CV|4.0|My first impression upon listening to the new CD was how &quot;rich and vibrant&quot; her sound is. I was lured right away! I've always been an admirer of Diana Krall's music and have heard her in different settings: solo piano, trios, quartets and string/orchestra accompaniments. &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; comprised of ballads and bossa novas, has a symphony orchestra backing her up and in no way does this hamper but compliments her amazing talent and voice. Diana's &quot;new sound,&quot; produced by her collaboration with arranger and conductor Claus Ogerman, is a very welcome change. Here, Diana re-invents her music and we see her grow musically as an artist. You'll definitely find your own favorites in this CD as I have.<br /> We got a taste of how Diana could sound with some of her orchestra-backed songs from her last album, &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; through her teaming with composer/arranger Johnny Mandel. It is in this new musical collaboration with Ogerman in &quot;The Look of Love&quot; that we see how Diana's musical talent will only get better. Her musical influences (Fats Waller, Jobim, Nat King Cole, etc.) and her work with today's talented musicians, composers and arrangers will only continue to mold and shape her musically. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for her.<br /> One might say that &quot;The Look of Love&quot; does not sound like a jazz album. But look at what Charlie Parker did in 1949 when he produced an album that incorporated a string ensemble: &quot;Charlie Parker With Strings: The Master Takes&quot; (listen to &quot;Just Friends&quot;). Look at Diana's new effort as an opportunity for her to express her musical talent - a fresh approach in her expression and delivery of songs. To quote Diana &quot;I don't want to be categorized whether or not (I'm) with jazz anymore or if I appear on a pop album - then I'm 'selling out'. I would just like to be an artist and being an artist means being able to choose whatyou want to do.&quot; Enough said!<br />The bottomline on why I like this CD: her voice, her talent, and (most important of all) the way her music makes me feel - S'WONDERFUL!
B00000634J|5.0|From the String arrangement Of &quot;Imagine&quot; to the hidden, but now  not hidden heartbeat bassline of &quot;Instant Karma&quot;, Ms. Ono (who has co-produced the remastering of these songs) once again brings to light a simple but eloquent touch to the soul of John Ono Lennon. From the tinkle of the tambourine flowing through #9 Dream, to the crumpled sounds the bed sheets make in &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;. A sense of John's fragile but heart rendering exploration of one's existence truly is timeless. This collection is brilliantly relised and re-visited<br />P.S. The tribal &quot;chant&quot; at the end of Cold Turkey is as bone chilling as ever.
B000021YQV|5.0|I was shocked by the negative reviews in this list. Most of them quoted such things as &quot;can't sing, not complex, not interesting&quot;. Others compared them to...dear god..Bon Jovi and Tool.<BR>Lets get our genres right people. This is metal with a political skew. If you don't like really loud fast riffs, but were enjoying the melody in Chop Suey, then you won't like this album. The trademark of this band is thier ability to have the loud mix with the soft, mix the screaming with the singing, and mix comedy with serious messages about such things as the prison system, police brutality, losing personality (chop suey, listen and think what he's saying).....<BR>Like the first album, this album has a different message in every song. Also, you have to accept that the band members are WEIRD. Thier sound is anything but normal. you should go to a record store and listen to thier first album and this album if you can.<BR>As for the complaints thus mentioned, don't compare this band to any other. You have to look at what thier saying. As for talent needed to play this? Try playing some of these on the guitar. Don't think he can sing? Try singing some of these lines the WAY he does. They have a middle eastern influence in both guitar and voice.<BR>If you liked spiders....ATWA is cool. If you liked the entire first album, you will like this album beyond all belief.  Oh yeah, and everyong I know who likes TOOL (I've been a fan since 1993) likes this band because people who get both these bands GET WHAT THEY&quot;RE SAYING.
B00005A46T|3.0|....<br />Now for the music... yes, it is heavy.  Yes, it does make you bang your head. But... it sounds so much like the first one after they stated that it would be even more brutal than their first CD. Well... it isn't. After I read that in a magazine, I was kind of looking forward to hearing it. I mean they stated that they loved \\"old school\\" metal, such as Exodus, Slayer, and others. One even claimed that he was into Death Metal. But upon listening to this CD, I couldn't help but hear anything but a rehash of their first CD in disguise. I was hoping for an all out attack on my ears, but unfortunately did not get it. It's not a bad CD, but it isn't what they claimed it would be. I listen to it on occasion, but it certainly is not the album of the year. Later.
0451196716|5.0|Hey everyone! I found this book awesome! You may be thinking...&quot;Yeah, yeah of course he likes it,&quot; but i Love this book and I'm only eleven years old! Sure I didn't understand much of it, but it was still very cool! Not a great book for people who are squeamish.
B000000W5P|4.0|if you are waiting some of these songs on the radio before u buy, Shattered won't be among those played. In light of the recent attacks in New York, it has been banned from all radio play because of it's lyrics &quot;What a mess this town's in tatters I've been shattered My brain's been battered, splattered all over Manhattan.&quot; It's a great song, and if you want to hear it, you'll have to buy the cd
0440214041|5.0|Another Great Grisham Novel! I personally loved this novel. Even if you're a person who doesn't like to read much, once you start reading this, you'll be at the edge of your seat, reading for hours. The novel had a great plot line and good characters too. Whenever you suspect someone in the novel, you suddenly find out you were wrong the whole time. Grisham used a lot of creativity and suspense to make the novel an enjoyable one.         The reason I liked the novel is because I enjoy reading suspense-building novels and even law-firm stories. Although it didn't have as much to do with lawyers as most of his other books, it's still enjoyable. I also liked it because of the characters. Another thing that made it great is the story.    (Textual evidence- pg. 291)       \\"...She left and Gray turned to Darby. He pointed to a set of doors that appeared to lead to the only hallway. She took a deep breath, and walked quickly through them. They opened into a large junction from which three sterile corridors branched out. A brass plate pointed to rooms 18 through 30. It was the center wing of the hospital, and the hall was dark and quiet...\\"        Great novel, descriptive details, creativity, and suspense-building characters are all things that Grisham included to make the novel great, which is why I loved it!
B00003CY5H|5.0|I thought the movie the score was a great film.  I personally haven't seen a great film like that in years.  If you haven't seen it go and see it now.  One reason why it was a good movie was because it had a great script.  And two it is because it had a couple really good actors such as Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and Edward Norton.
B00005PJ8I|5.0|This movie can be viewed from different levels. On the outside, the film is a great survival story of a man stranded on an uninhabitated island. Chuck Noland, the main character played by Tom Hanks, finds several inventive ways to live off the land, and the viewer is brought into the film by observing Noland's actions and tactics in confronting the sobering isolation.<br />On a deeper level, this movie deals with some moving themes, expressed through powerfully symbolic methods. In the first part of the movie, Chuck Noland (whose name is also metaphorical)is a top &quot;Federal Express&quot; employee obsessed with racing against time. Time is a major idea that permeates throughout the entire feature, and symbols of time appear and reappear. Noland's outlook on time changes as the movie progresses. In the end, he has to deal with what fate has dictated to him. Hanks compelling performance in the concluding scenes is moving and captivating. I have heard some complain about the ending of the film, but for me this was the most essential part of the entire piece. For me, it presented a metaphorical situation that represents a point that, in different ways, everyone faces at sometime in life. I feel that only top movies should be issued into the home library, and CAST AWAY is definitely one of them.
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot Rules!! The best songs are Everything Ends(#5), The Heretic Anthem(#6), Left Behind(#8), and Iowa(#14). This is the best CD I have ever bought!!
B00005NB0H|5.0|The original LIVE AT LEEDS is by far the greatest live album of all time. Why this was remastered in 1995 and not released in the complete concert format is unknown to me. I also think this 2 CD set should have been released in the correct running order, even if this splits up Tommy. Other than that, this is a great set of music that any WHO fan should have.
B00005LMBK|3.0|This CD reminds me of the first Talking Heads CD. One great song, with the remainder being truly uninspired songs that are almost painful to listen to. &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; is cool and original, with a fantastic Music Video. Buy the single and save some $$.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Jurassic Park 3 is much better than the awful 'The Lost World' but not as good as the first film.<BR>The Spinosaurus and the Pterodactyls are spectacular and make this a great ride.The director has wisely not made it overlong or overblown(as 'The Lost World' was)but the question is-just how long is the audience going to but the ridiculous idea that the dinosaurs can't be shot? <BR>Once again we don't see a so much as a bullet being fired at them.Absurd.
B000002U82|5.0|With cover art of a prism set against a pure black background one knows from the start that Pink Floyd wasn't about the human image, but rather about an artistic one. On the most classic of the classic Pink Floyd albums, they reached their peak between the early experimental Floyd and the Roger Waters social commentary Floyd (both of which have their merits). Here the whole band seemed to be on the same page, each playing their part to perfection. Waters chose to make an album about the madness that exists in all aspects in human life and how it all eventually catches up to us. The beginning introduces the madness (Speak to Me/Breathe) and how over time it eventually catches up to us (On the Run and Time). Then it drives us to our end (Great Gig in the Sky). We are shown the root of the madness (Money) and how it divides us (Us and Them, Any Colour You Like) and how it drives us to mental breakdown and overtakes us (Brain Damage/Eclipse). Lyrics among Roger Waters best and the music fits the mood perfectly. IMO the best musicianship by Floyd is on this ablum and it conveys the lyrics perfectly along with the sound effects.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|Using camera work similar to &quot;Sign O'The Times&quot; concert film, Prince offers us his millenium New Year's concert filmed at Paisley Park. Sound and visual quality excellent, and the close-ups of Prince are breathtaking on DVD!
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles proved that even in turmoil, greatness can triumph. &quot;Let It Be&quot; proved to be draining (the music isn't though) and all seemed doomed in Beatleland. Amazing enough is that this album feels so free and fun. The difference here is the incredible contributions of the overlooked Beatles. George (my personal favorite Beatle) has his 2 best Beatle tracks in &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and Ringo shines on the underappreciated &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;; along with the same superb musicianship by the two as always (George on lead guitar and Ringo on drums if you didn't know). Lennon and McCartney also step it up a level with classics like John's &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;She's So Heavy&quot; (I wish the end never stopped) and Paul's side 2 medley. As stated earlier, the musicianship shines here as Paul's always super bass playing and John's guitar work are at their top.
630522577X|5.0|My Fair Lady is a feast for the senses. The story of poor girl makes good is lavishly portrayed in one of the most successful transformations from stage to screen. The exquisite Audrey Hepburn proves more than a match for Rex Harrison and the rest of the consummate cast. Lovers of period costume will delight in the wardrobe, and those that enjoy the charm of the musical lyric will be captivated by Marni Nixon's renditions. This will also appeal to the Anglophile who can never get enough of the London of old. Both sad and funny My Fair Lady is a bittersweet confection that will be sure to delight.
B000002UB6|5.0|Underneath the giant production done by Phil Spector is the orginal concept for &quot;Let It Be&quot;: back to basics, straightforward rock and roll. This was supposed to have a live feel to it and it does, but Spector's production does take some of it away. Fortunately the songs are so good it doesn't matter. They may not be the Beatle's best, but the collection is filled with fun, breezy rock songs that don't try to amaze you, just entertain, which it does perfectly. Stand out tracks include &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; &quot;I Me Mine,&quot; &quot;Let It Be,&quot; &quot;Get Back&quot; and pretty much all the others.
B00003CX5P|2.0|If you liked the characters and relatively good story from the first three Star Wars movies, than DO NOT watch this one. The shallow story goes right along with characters of the same. A fun sci-fi style movies with decent action, but a not too good story. Then ther is the real killer Jar Jar Binks. Star Wars albatross. Rent this one.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall's sixth album release represents something of a departure from an established format that has seen the singer / pianist accompanied by bass and guitar with occasional drums and, on 1995's Only Trust your Heart, some wonderful saxophone courtesy of Stanley Turrentine.  The Look of Love creates a much fuller sound with DK and her trio accompanied by a symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman.  <br />Smooth and stylish though it is, the recording is ultimately far less satisfying than Miss Krall's previous releases. Only Trust Your Heart, All For You, Love Scenes and When I Look In Your Eyes are four fabulous records built on uncomplicated arrangements and fine interplay between the singer and her musicians. The results are remarkably effective but the players on this record are swamped in lush orchestrations that stifle and detract from their undoubted talents. DK's singing seems affected and laboured while her piano is heard only fleetingly. One can't help but feel that the results would have been so much better had DK recorded the same set of songs with just Christian McBride (bass) and Russell Malone (guitar). One last point that only adds to the disappointment is the record's sound quality that seems distorted in places. This reviewer's copy has already been returned.  Sorry Amazon!

B00002DE0S|5.0|Zimerman conducted from the keyboard a hand-selected group of young musicians. The end result was a well balanced performance of 2 romantic concertos. Both pianist and orchestra were careful and complimented each other well. Playing was relaxed and sound was well balanced. As tempo was a little slower than usual, some people may find these 2 pieces slightly draggy. Price-wise, this set is certainly more expensive since there are 2 discs with no fill-ins. If you are just looking for a set of both Chopin's concertos, this is highly recommended.
0790729628|3.0|Though the movie looks excellent and the story is still awesome, I find myself really missing the voice over from the earlier version.  The running internal monologue of Harrison Ford's character vastly improved the depth of the film, in my opinion.  So, the original version gets my 4 stars, while this version only gets 3.  Still quite enjoyable.
B00005NW02|4.0|but SOAD are really a different band. They're as hard and heavy as any other band, but they do something many other 'metal' bands don't-they add melody, intelligent lyrics, and melody-shifting, shape forming music. I don't want to get too bogged down, but this is, to me, relaxing music. I have all the lyrics and music shifts memorized, so it's just something to cycle through when I'm relaxing. The only downfall is that if you listen to it too much, it gets...boring. There are 14 songs, but the album still is only like 40 minutes long, so it doesn't take long for it to grate on your nerves. But it's still a lot better than Drowning Pool or Slipknot or POD, so I'd give it a buy.

B00005OWEG|5.0|Recently, I had the privilege of viewing the new directors cut of Apocalypse Now known as `Redux'. It is simply a spectacular restoration of a movie that already was a masterpiece. <br />Almost an hour worth of new footage has been added in. The original always had the sense of being hurried. This new version gives the film more breathing space and develops characters more. They cover a second encounter with the gunboat crew and the Playboy Bunnies seen previously at the U.S.O show and A much-talked about scene at a French Plantation. There is also additional footage of the Air Cavalry and some more footage from the Kurtz Compound. <br />The best of the new footage is the added footage of the Air Cavalry and of Willard's Gunboat crew. The original cut never really explains why Captain Willard and his men leave after the attack on Charlie's Point so quickly; we assume it's to continue with their mission. `Redux' explains why. I am not going to tell but this new footage shows more of the insanity of Colonel Kilgore and shows that Captain Willard is not the stone-faced, boring guy we assumed he was (He actually smiles!). <br />But this is no ordinary Director's Cut, which basically throws in new footage and does nothing else. Francis Ford Coppola and Walter Murch (One of the original editors) have remade `Redux' literally from scratch. The \\"new\\" footage has been restored to match with the original. In addition, Coppola and Murch might have changed some of the existing footage. What I mean is that they have not changed the scene itself, but the camera angle where it was filmed. For example, when Willard kills Kurtz, first off Kurtz is reading an Air Force statement that is banning crewman from putting the F-Word on their planes. In the original, when he was killed, it only showed a forward view of him as he was stabbed. In this version, Kurtz turns around before he is attacked and then shows a struggle between Kurtz and Willard, leading to Kurtz's eventual death. <br />But even `Redux' has its flaws. The encounter with the Playboy Bunnies, while harmless, doesn't really have anything to do with the film. It basically shows that people might get desperate enough in wartime to have sex in exchange for fuel. But the French Plantation is not as easy to sit through. Except for showing what the French think of American involvement in Vietnam (Negative of course) and more personality development for Captain Willard (He smokes opium and even has an attraction for a French woman), it has nothing to do with the film's plot. Some call this a trip through time and indeed it has an eerie feeling throughout (Largely because there is fog everywhere). But otherwise the film would not have been hurt if this scene was left out and instead was used as an extra on the DVD. <br />Overall, while deliberately paced and a bit tedious (Plus it has graphic violence and many uses of four letter words), Redux proves to be as good if not better that the original. I wonder if it can be eligible for Oscar contendership. I doubt any of other movies this year would be much competition. <br />I await the DVD and VHS releases of this film with keen anticipation. But no matter how good the picture and sound quality is and no matter how many extras are included, nothing will match the experience of watching this movie in theaters. Watching this movie on the twenty-first of August 2001 was an unforgettable experience that cannot be summed up in words. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself!
B00003CXX8|5.0|&quot;The Glass House&quot; is an excellent movie that is portrayed by Lee-lee Sobieski whose parents are killed in a car-accident and she goes and lives with her parents closest friends, at least she thinks so.  The movie progresses as she finds out that the &quot;Glasses&quot; who she lives with are not who they appear to be.  This is an excellent movie, one of the best I have seen in a while.  Not very scary but suspensful, you never know what will happen next.  The Glass house will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00005N9CV|1.0|For all of you (myself included) who really enjoyed Diana Krall's recordings to date, this is a major disappointment. After the marvelous &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes,&quot; I looked forward to this release with great anticipation. However, the terrific ensemble band has been replaced by an orchestra. The playful and improvising singer that Krall was has become a mellow Astrud Gilberto clone. The music accompaniment sounds alike with every song in the CD, with its swelling strings, metronome-like percussions and right on the beat guitar chords. Even Krall's piano riffs sound polite and tame, as if they are afraid to disturb the steady click-clack rhythm of the drums. The whole CD sounds like Krall was lulled to a nap by the sleepwalking orchestration. This is Krall becoming mainstream, except it is plain boring elevator music. Diana, haven't you learned from John Denver?!
0792846303|3.0|Director John Carpenter creates an old-fashioned campfire ghost story with THE FOG. Antonio Bay, a quaint, small seaside town is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its founding. That night a heavy, mysterious fog rolls through the town and people begin to die in savage ways. Rumors of a secret as old as the town begin to surface and the people of Antonio Bay realize they are victims of long dead sailors who have come to revenge their own murders at the hands of the town's founding fathers. The townspeople can only wait for the fog to roll in and pray that they are not the next to die. <br />Carpenter creates a chilling film with THE FOG and gets fine performances out of Adrienne Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, and the fog itself, which creeps and crawls around as if it were alive. The film elicits its scares out of what is not seen rather than what is, and Carpenter exploits that style perfectly. Vauge shapes move within the fog, while strange noises heard in the distance grow louder, and no one can say exactly what they are up against. THE FOG is one of Carpenter's earlier films and helped to establish his reputation as a master filmmaker. <br />I find this movie very original. The idea of the fog was original itself and John Carpenter put a good plot together. This has to be one of his best horror movies ever made, eventhough HALLOWEEN is better.<br />If you notice, John Carpenter's character's names are names of people John Carpenter has worked with. Names like Nick Castle and a few others like Dan O'Bannon. That is mainly the most noticable part of the film.<br />At first when you're watching the film, it seems like it's going to be boring, but then it gets really good when Jamie Lee Curtis is picked up by Tom Atkins. This film has a load of suspense and shouldn't be missed by anyone!<br />I originally would have given this movie three and a half stars. That's how good I think it is. But if you're a younger person, then you may not like it too much. I would suggest this film for a teenager at least.<br />I hope my review was helpful to you!
B00005NP04|5.0|Picking the best Martina McBride songs must be like picking which child you love most; there is simply no such thing as a bad Martina recording.<br />Blessed with the most unbelievable beautiful voice in music today, Martina has become known for her powerful yet delicate delivery and her songs with a message of strength and empowerment. The collection provides a wonderful overview of Martina's strengths for the casual fan, and a powerful punch for the dedicated follower of her music.<br />First, as indicated, every Martina hit from the past decade is included, with commentary from Martina in the liner notes. From the signature &quot;Independence Day&quot; to the haunting &quot;A Broken Wing,&quot; you'll find flawless vocal performances punctuated with lyrics that reflect a woman who has a strong sense of self and of right and wrong.<br />As a treat for those of us who have everything Martina, there are four new tracks that are all breathtaking in their own way. &quot;When God-Fearing Women Get The Blues&quot; is just a flat-out good time song with a driving beat and a sense of whimsy. &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; features the killer notes that make Martina such a singing legend; I've played this track over and over just in awe of the sheer power of her voice.<br />&quot;Concrete Angel&quot; touches on the topic of child abuse in the most understated gut-wrenching way; as a guy, I don't cry much, but when I first heard the song, I have to admit it got to me. The song is that good. Finally, &quot;Blessed&quot; is an autobiographical track perhaps, with a radio-friendly Nasvhiile sound that you might associate with Faith Hill.<br />This CD is perfect for anyone -- those who are just wanting to get a good solid Martina collection, or those of us who want every bit we can get.
0679759328|1.0|The anti-heroine of the book, Edith, describes her hotel room as drab.  She might as well have been describing the whole novel.  There are no redeeming qualities here.  There is not a single lovable character in the entire story.  These are our choices: Mrs. Pusey and her daughter, both of them so divine that probably do not need to ever  go to the bathroom, Monica and her obnoxious dog, the caricature of Mme. de Bonneuil, the hotelier and his airs of grandeur, and slimy Mr. Neville.  We also hear about Penelope, who happens to be Edith's neighbor and best friend, and we can only feel sorry for Edith.  Of course, that sorrow lasts for about 2 seconds, because Edith is a vocational doormat. The descriptions of place are stuffy, and the sky is gray all the time! The ending is depressing, because nothing happens to Edith.  She does not become a better, stronger person after her vacation.  She stays the same way, being a passive, boring pushover.  What I want to know is what the judges of the Booker prize were thinking!  Maybe the competition that year was even more terrible.
B00005N9CV|1.0|I was very pleased to see that Diana was releasing a new CD so I pre-ordered (very convenient).  While I know that this was another step forward in her musical career, I was disappointed with the syrupy arrangements and heavy strings.   She is an incredibly accomplished musician and songstress and I was looking forward to another well-crafted, intimate jazz album, with tight arrangements, showcasing her voice as well as her excellent piano skills and that of the other fine jazz musicians in her group.  I would not have purchased this if I had heard the musical clips on Amazon
B00005NP04|5.0|I am never satisfied with &quot;hits&quot; packages from my favorite artists!  There are always songs not included that I feel should have been.  This one is no exception, but barely!  I feel the collection would have been a more rounded overview of the last decade of McBride's music if she would have included at least one or two songs from her critically acclaimed debut album.  The songs might not have been top ten hits, but &quot;The Time Has Come&quot; and &quot;Cheap Whiskey&quot; (my absolute favorite!) were video staples on CMT and TNN before she was a star.  Also, it would have showed the overall growth of the artist better!  Other than that minor complaint, Martina McBride's &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is way above average, with the positives outweighing the negative.  All of the other four studio albums are represented here very well, including her last one (I hate buying a &quot;hits&quot; album and not one song from the previous record is on it!).  The four (!) new songs are destined to be hits!  These four songs are great samples of what's to come.  But, the best part of the album is the linear notes.  McBride and producer Paul Worley discuss every song on here, good and bad parts!  I love reading the artist insights into her music.  This collection is just a reminder of what a breath of fresh air McBride has been to country music.  She is the best female artist out there that continues to explore and grow as an artist.  This compliation of hits is proof of that.
B00005N9CV|4.0|More symphonic than her previous outing, Diana shows she belt out the classics like they were her own. She adds her own exquisite touch to each of these songs. A definite must for for all of her fans.
B00004Z459|5.0|As a few other people stated in the reviews, every single song on this cd is awesome.  Normally I'll buy a cd and only find a few songs I like.  This cd has 12 songs that are worthy of radio play.  A definete must buy cd.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Hands down, this is one of the best black comedies I have ever seen. I can't even list all of the great things about because it would make this review way too long. All the acting is perfect. This is one of the top 15 movies of the 70's and that's saying a lot considering how many great films were released in that decade.
B00005N9CV|5.0|If you have read anything at all about female Jazz singers recently, you are most likely to have heard of  the 23-year-old Jane Monheit and about how she might be the &quot;next Diana Krall&quot;, or something to that effect. If you do not know both singers, you may feel tempted to see if they are indeed comparable. And I am here to tell you they are not.<BR>Go ahead, give Monheit's last album (&quot;Come Dream With Me&quot;) a try, if you must. Then come listen to this jewel and realize how some of the greatest songs of our era should be sung - my feeling is that it is exactly the way Ms. Krall sings them. Quite simply, she understands what they mean. That, my friend, makes all the difference in the world.<BR>Need I tell you about the arrangements? They are fantastic, with the outside influences (Brazilian, Pop) in all the right places. Nothing ever goes too far here.<BR>Make no mistake, this is the real deal. You'll see.

The #12 bonus track is the Beatles &quot;I Got a Feeling&quot;.  The #13 hidden track is the same hidden track on the US release: an instrumental version of &quot;Once&quot;.<br />This does not have the 3 extra tracks (Wash, Dirty Frank, Alive(live)) that is on the other imports.

B00005IC2H|4.0|MTV2 was my source of info about this band. I had heard little tidbits here and there, but none of it interested me. I like their first single, I won't write it out. It's mellow and fits my ever-changing mood. Unlike the pretentious reviewers on this site that proclaim that this is the music Radiohead wished they had made, and all the people from Iceland proclaiming they are in on something I am obviously not, I am not going to spout off some pseudo-intellectual tirade about nothing more than trivial matters. I just like the music, pure and simple. It is the kind of music I can listen to over and over, and never grow tired of. For that, I am grateful for Sigur Ros.
B00003BDXG|4.0|Natural Born Killers is one of those rare movies that, for an individual who has had a bad day or under sever depression from perhaps a dark period of time in his life that cannot be forgotten and forever affected him, would be of a primary choice for their viewing pleasure, for it seems to be doing all of the screaming for you, or whatever else sort of physical act that would be considered as a \\"rehabilitation\\". And how could it not? Shifting from film to video, from color to black-and-white, from 35mm to Super 8, from sitcom parody to newsreel parody, and from one film stock to another, the psychedelic direction and frenetic pace totally gave me the sensation that I was in my parent's car in the highway driving like a maniac, not giving a damn how fast I was going, merely trying to do whatever I could to prevent myself from really expressing emotions regarding those sitting right next to me. And with the help of the soundtrack, the affect was amazing, for it was an ideal blend that infused a real rhythm into every scene that was at once breathtaking, exhilarating and wildly intense. The soundtrack drives you with both pounding controversial lyrics to the classic and contemporaneous.<br />Natural Born Killers is a visually-stunning, wickedly-funny and devilishly-entertaining slam of violence and media obsession that's, as the synopsis on the VHS package describes, \\"the most radical film any major studio has released since A Clockwork Orange\\"-a belief I would purely have to agree with; however, I, unlike many others, don't loathe it for that. <BR>It sickens me to actually hear about a court case going forward that will attempt to fine Oliver Stone and Warner Bros. for releasing this controversial film that apparently baffled many and mixed many emotions. What audiences do subsequent to its viewing shouldn't be blamed upon the filmmakers, these insightful and righteous people with a simple aptitude to express; they aren't the ones that committed the crimes for Christsake, yet somehow are accused for the influence. (Within each and every one of us lies a \\"demon\\" that awaits to come out and expose of its deeds; it's just a matter of how you do that, you see, whether on screen or beyond it.) I think many as of this day have missed the significance of it all, the whole point of the film. Oliver Stone wasn't attempting to incite violence with it. Stone was merely attempting to make a film that made us experience the true nature of violence, in order to see just how absurd it is when the media makes killers heroes. <BR>(Depicting images in his characters' inner worlds that are both experiences from their past as well as the accumulated past, those outside their direct experiences, Stone doesn't make his point any clearer, for they are displayed as being the subconscious driving forces behind their violence. What lies within Mickey now encircles him. Stone splatters his mind on the walls. It's brilliant!)<br />In spite of the fact that the Motion Picture Association of America threatened to give the film an NC-17 rating \\"for extreme violence and graphic carnage, for shocking images, and for strong language and sexuality,\\" you could have easily named a number of other films that were twice as violent, but Stone has touched a nerve here, because his film isn't about violence, but rather how we correspond with it, and that is sincerely shocking. <br />Although his aim was to have us experience the true nature of violence-an aim that I guess didn't make its way out of all that fog for many-I'm sure his film also meant as a warning with regards to where we're heading and what might become of us, for we are the Jerry Springer generation. We are altering into a society that's much more fascinated in crime and scandal than in anything else-more than in politics and the arts, and perhaps even more than sports, unless crime has become our new national sport... In a world like this, anything is possible.<br />Aside from the director, who I think created his greatest, most compelling picture yet, for it was a stylistically-crafted work-of-art with a real message strong enough to have the right to open eyes, and many unique techniques in filmmaking that are rarely ever seen, the entire cast was spectacular; they ignited on screen! I especially was impressed watching Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis comically portraying these morally inferior and mentally-disturbed individuals whom devoid of any sympathy of feeling toward others. Woody Harrelson, who subsequent to his career in the popular eighties sitcom, Cheers, was the only one out of the gang to have a successful movie career, not only enticed Stone because he's a great actor who obviously proved that he can take on dramatically different rolls but because, as Stone himself says in an interesting interview you'll discover on the Director's Cut, of the iniquity in which he was easily able to make out from his facial appearance, and in general for the fact that he knew he had a bad childhood with his father and all, which perfectly suits his character, you see, for he was cognizant of the impact this actor would have among others. He knew. Now is that brilliant or what?
B000001EUR|5.0|This album is just great, it's the best album by maybe the best band ever. &quot;The same thrill&quot; is a really crappy track, and I don't understand what is does there, but the rest of the album is just great.

Woody Harrelson (who subsequent to his career in the popular eighties sitcom Cheers, was the only one out of the gang to have a successful movie career) not only enticed Stone because hes a great actor who obviously proved that he can take on drasticallynew rolls but because, and as Stone himself says in an interview which youll discover on the Directors Cut, of the iniquity in which he was easily able to make out from his facial appearance, and in general for the fact that he knew he had a bad childhood, which perfectly suits his character, you see, for he was cognizant of the impact this actor would deliver onto the screen, like the vivid man that he is.
0060278234|5.0|Ok! Lireal is a fatastic book. I love the dog and it is really cool how Lireal figures out how to make the best of things. Although, I personally didn't like what happend to Sabriel and Touchstone. They seemed to loose their flare. This book, like Sabriel didn't end very well I know there is going to be another book but Nix could of put a better ending on it (I had to reade Shade's Children to make sure Nix new how to end a book). Anyway this is a a great book read it, BUT READ SABRIEL 1st or eles you will be lost! Mogget Rules hehe!
B00004Z459|4.0|In retrospect it's ironic that I bought this cd after hearing One Step Closer, just two days after the cds realease. For me, the song is probably the low point of the cd, when the band becomes just another rap/rock no name face. Lyricly...its shallow. Musically...its kinda boring. And that shut up part... But through all this I like the song, cuz it made me get this cd.<br />First and foremost, Linkin Park (no question, HYBRID THEORY was twice the name) is NOT your average rap/rock band, despite what Crawling and OSC might lead you to believe...Without question these guys have combined hip hop kinda rap with metal but not quite metal guitars, while managing to throw in a not nearly as annoying as you would think dj and a singer/screamer with talent in both areas of his profession. The finished product is a well oiled band with better than average songwriting ability.<br />The best songs on this cd are undoubtedly the ones that feature both the singer and the kinda rapper, where the band smoothly blends Shindoa's carefully crafted rhymes with Bennington's powerful vocals. &quot;In the End&quot; &quot;Papercut&quot; &quot;Forgotten&quot; and &quot;A Place for my Head&quot; are great is this respect...&quot;Points of Authority&quot; is pretty good too.<br />The second level of songs are the ones that focus mainly on the singing of Bennington, while leaving Shindoa pretty much out of work. &quot;Pushing me Away&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; rival the previous set of songs.<br />Then theres the rest. This is what keeps the cd from getting 5 stars. I already talked about One Step Closer, quite simply I think its trying to hard to be mainstream. &quot;With You&quot; is quite sad...I think this track has the single best lyrics on the cd in the verses, with perfect music to back it...and then Bennington screws it up with his vocals. &quot;Cure for the Itch,&quot; &quot;Crawling,&quot; and &quot;By Myself&quot; are just kinda boring, nothing special.<br />In the End (best song on the cd!)...get it...if only to see what the real Linkin Park is all about.
0800105141|5.0|A wonderful movie this is. Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 Acadaemy Award Winner for Best movie shows his direction and insight into the first leader of independent India Mohandras Gandhi. The movie is reafirming to those who choose peace and love instead of violence and hatred.<br />Ben Kingsley gives a convincing and mesmorising portrayal of Mohandas Gandhi, the peaceful warrior. Kingsley rightly deserved the 1982 Oscar for Best Actor. From the moment you first see Gandhi in the movie you forget it is Ben Kingsley playing him, and start to think it is Gandhi. The movie is shot in some beautiful places in India as well as the not so beautiful places such as the riots in the large cities. Either way, the movie gives the important events in the history of India during and after British occupation in an unflinchingly manner.<br />I consider Mohandras Gandhi a personal hero of mine and his hatred of violence but his refusal to kneel down to racism, opression of the poor and wrong doing in the name of greater empire glory is a message all of humanity should know about. His words and insight are so revelant to the world today even 50 years after his death. This is a movie that captures the insight of Gandhi, it shows the personal struggle of him and the people of India during the time of British occupation and its eventual freedom. Also shown is the tragic conflict at the time between the newly independent India and the new Islamic Nation of Pakistan and what Gandhi tried to do to bring the two cultures together peacefully. Unfortunately today there is still suspicion and hatred between the two nations. But we all should hope that peace will eventually spread throughout the two nations and the world.<br />What an excellent movie this is and is highly recommended to everyone.

B00005NB0H|5.0|This concert never ceases to amaze me. I first bought Live at Leeds when I was 15 years old and almost wore the vinyl out. The liner notes (in the 1995 re-issue) say it all about The Who that night: &quot;They played like they had a sixth sense&quot;. In 1970, it was the best live album ever put out and it still is. So, imagine how happy I was when it was reissued with additional songs in 1995. The additions sounded as great as the original album.<BR>Sometime thereafter I found bootlegs at cd shows which touted it as the &quot;Complete Live at Leeds&quot; but I wouldn't buy because I feared the usual poor sound quality of a bootleg. I had also read that Pete Townshend didn't approve of adding the &quot;Tommy&quot; portion to the 1995 release because he believed the sound quality was poor.<BR>Townshend couldn't be more wrong. If the quality was poor, they did a hell of a job remixing the Deluxe Edition. All instruments and vocals are as exceptional as the previous releases. The Who themselves couldn't have planned the way they played that night any better than they did. (In fact, Keith Moon didn't miss a beat the entire night. He was simply incredible and the Deluxe Edition does him justice.) The Isle of Wight cd, which contained the only available entire live performance of &quot;Tommy&quot; when it came out, now sounds like a cover band in comparison. Only a video of this concert could top this. This cd was always considered one of the best live rock recordings and NOW THE BEST JUST GOT BETTER.
B000001Y79|4.0|This was my intro to the band and I must say that it was a good one. Gwen has an amazing voice and she puts it to work well on these high-energy tunes. The best ones are &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; &quot;Excuse me Mister,&quot; &quot;Just a Girl&quot;(my personal favorite from the album), and &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; which is such a beautiful song despite the downbeat nature. The main reason why I didn't rate it perfectly is that &quot;The Climb&quot; drags on a bit. A few songs were a bit weak like &quot;You can do it.&quot; It's a must have for current fans and serves well as an introduction for new fans. Worth the buy.
B000059H99|5.0|Wow!!  <br />Society encourages you to relegate this movie to mere Hollywood cliche.  Yet upon every viewing it is as fresh and alive as the first:  I still get the goosebumps!!  <br />MAN, DO I GET THE GOOSEBUMPS!!<br />I love the audio commentary!!  It is the most tight of any DVD I have seen with so many cast and crew taking part.  Each jamming their own p.o.v. into the mix. It never lags for a second.<br />And Stallone - in only a simple face to camera video commentary - takes you thru all the twists and turns, lows and highs that made his debut forever THE DEBUT!!  <br />I feel as if I have seen the movie all over again for the very first time - as a one man show in a mere 1/2 hour!?!  <br />Along with Fred Astaire; Sylvestor Stallone is still my favouite actor!!  I'd watch him in anything - barring 'The Specialist'.<br />Subsequent to this movie Sly could have been so much more; if only he had allowed himself - to once again - to become so much less.  <BR>A very talented man who puffed  himself up so much he became peceived as less than he truly was.<br />Yet an actor  - who's films in the 1980's reeked of Ameican Plastic - can still inspire and send gooey shivers down another man's spine with just the warmth of his voice, the sensitivity of his arguement and the childlike wonder in his eyes.<br />If actions speak louder than words then this is a very  perceptive, warm, sensitive, mentally articulate human being!!<br />He is the only actor/person I enjoy despite the obvious false humility and controlled pretention.  He is truly likeable and still overwhelmingly inspiring.  A most under appreciated star, actor, writer, director, editor and all around personality!!!<br />America do not forget Sylvestor Stallone....
B00005JKES|3.0|Rights or no rights, this set will fall far far short of five stars without the superb pilot.  Someone needs to get some lawyers in action or the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; set will be decidedly &quot;in&quot;complete.  And, no, an eight-year-old VHS tape of the European theatrical release bought off ebay for fify dollars just won't cut it.

6304341849|5.0|After seeing this movie I immediately ran to buy the book. Both book and film are so incredibly wonderful I hesitate to try to do justice to either in a review. The movie is really spectacular, staying impecably true to the book in pretty much every way. 99.9 percent of the movie's dialogue comes straight out of the book, unchanged. Besides the great script (thank you E. M. Fortster!) the acting is really amazing. There is not a single character in this movie who isn't perfectly portrayed. James Wilby as the title character gives a brilliantly multi-faceted performance and Rupert Graves as Alec Scudder makes you believe he has three times as many lines as he really does just through his expression and presence. I'll also give kudos to Hugh Grant because this was before his big break and therefore he actually gives a very admirable, non-egotisic performance. The only thing I resent is that the movie box has HIM on the cover... WHAT?! Ah, marketing. Sigh. But this movie is really a rare and beautiful piece of art. Like Forster, it is life and love-affirming. All of E. M. Forster's books have a beautiful quality of hope about them--they acknowledge that pain and suffering are parts of life, but they do not glorify them. This movie does a spectacular job of conveying that quality of the novel.
6304082428|4.0|When I first saw this, I was very &quot;prejudiced&quot; against it, because I had seen the other BBC version so many times.  But it grew on me (not that Colin Firth didn't help).  There are definitely parts from the other one that I prefer to this one (the scene where Darcy and Elizabeth confess they love each other--gaah! could they be stiffer?) but the depth of some of the characters is better in this one.  Darcy in particular is given more substance and motivation.  We see the progression of his feelings (we learn he actually HAS feelings) and actually feel sorry for him when he gets shot down.  Also, I heard Andrew Davies (the screenwriter) speak at a local university, and learned about all the little sexual innuendos he put into it.  Now when I see it, it's almost dirty.
0671027344|5.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower is written in first person through letters in an amazingly believable way. the way the book is written makes it entertaining. the cahracters that are introdced throughout the book are so vividly described that it seems as if they are real people. the book is written so that it describes a year in the life of the main character. it is truly and inspirational and wonderful book to read. this is one of my all time favorite books. i have read it over 3 times so far and skim through it a lot.
B000002WYT|5.0|This whole cd is complete with great high toned songs and ones that'll keep you listening to it forever.  Honestly, I couldn't believe that I was capable of listening to one certain song straight on for a month but when you get into &quot;Let You Down&quot; and &quot;#41&quot; you feel like you can't let go of them.  Each song on this album brings out the best of the Dave Matthews Band.  No one is a true fan without this cd.
0767849493|5.0|Rarely does a movie, book, event or person make you say, YES, THAT'S IT! This did. There are over 400 reviews and some feel like I do and others don't. Watch this movie.  It is worth the time when possibly you will experience a truly amazing relevation that makes you think about your spirituality.  <br />It's an idea. You must see the movie (last scene) to know what I am refering to. :)
B00003CXRP|3.0|Chuck Nowland (Tom Hanks) is a federal express agent. Chuck never gets to speand time with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt). Chuck is called away on bussiness on christmas eve. Chuck and Kelly have to exchange gifts in the car and Chuck gives her a box with supposely a wedding ring in it and tells Kelly to hold on to it. Chuck gets on the plane and the plane has trouble and goes down somewhere in the atlantic. Chuck is the only survivor. He finds land and tries to get food but it is hard when there is none! Chuck is finding boxes from the wrekage and in one of those boxes is a volleyball. Chuck puts a blood stain on the ball and names it &quot;Wilson&quot;. Chuck and Wilson have some very deep conversations. It is four years later now and Chuck is an expert at catching fish. Chuck  also lookes like ZZtop only about 50 pounds. Chuck fiannaly decides to make a raft and attempt to get off the island. After getting out to sea Chuck loses Wilson it is the most dramatic sceen in the movie. A whale squirts water on him when a boat is going by and he gets picked up. It is four weeks later and Chuck is all cleaned up and Fed Ex has a cermony four him. Chuck finnaly gets to see Kelly again only to find out that she is married and has a kid. They both figure out in that rain scene that they can never be together again. Chuck is left at the crossroads literaly.<BR>The 2-disc dvd set has a ton of great extras. But the extras and Tom Hanks briallant perfomance can't make this movie what it shouls be. I had a lot of questions after wacthing this movie like &quot;Why was Kelly screeming Jack when running down her drivway his name was Chuck!&quot;, and &quot;How Chuck he her screeming he was down the street?&quot;, also &quot;How could a whale save Chuck wouldn't the whale eat him?&quot;, also &quot;Why did Chuck talk to a volleyball?&quot;, another is &quot;What happenes to Chuck in the end?&quot;. It is hard for a movie to be good when the supporting character is an inanimate object!
B00005BJPO|5.0|Akira is unquestionably one of the most memorable animes of all time. It was first released in the U.S. about 16 years ago, and has continusly gained sucess among anime fans. This DVD is the ultimate Akira package, featuring the 100% digitally remastered movie Akira. With tons of extras and options such as the bilingual feature in which u can watch Akira in original japanese voices with or without subs, or just watch the original american version of Akira. And in the second DVD (exta DVD) there are several extras like soundtrack, production materials, misc Akira merchendise and comic covers from all around the world. Making this DVD the perfect Otaku's movie, and if you really enjoy the movie, you'll like the comics even more because there is much more content overall. Also keep in mind that this movie is rated R so parental discretion is advised.
B0000039PW|5.0|First of all, B.I.G. is one of the best rappers ever! And this is the REAL Biggie! The other two albums were not good.<BR>Who remember these songs: &quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;One more chance&quot;, &quot;Juicy&quot; and &quot;Big Poppa&quot;? These songs speak for theyselves.<BR>This CD is unbelievable. It deserves 5 stars from every REAL hip hopper. So...<BR>5.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This movie is definitely the best I've ever watched in my life: it's true, moving, simply beautiful. The actors are amazing, in spite of their young age (I especially want to underline River Phoenix's performance), and the story and everything are just great. I don't know much about movies or stuff, and I'm Italian, so it's even more difficult for me to express what &quot;Stand by me&quot; means to me, but believe me when I say that you absolutely have to watch it. You'll fall in love with it, forever.
0792101448|5.0|I'm not going to make any superlative statements about this film, because other reviewers have adequately expressed my opinion that this is perhaps the best western ever, and a necessary film for any film lover.<br />My only comment is that Paramount, or whoever owns the video rights to this film, MUST release an anamorphic DVD version immediately. IMMEDIATELY! There are simply no excuses.
B000002UR7|4.0|Although I purchased Pablo Honey just after their masterpiece OK Computer, back in 1997, this debut was actually the first Radiohead album I really got into. It's a very nice, maybe a bit punkrock-esque, album. I features some great outstanding tracks, such as 'You', 'Creep', 'Stop Whispering', 'Thinking About You', 'Anyone Can Play Guitar', 'Prove Yourself', 'Lurgee' and 'Blow Out'. <br />Actually there's only track on the album which is a bit of a disappointment; 'How Do You?'. It's a fast, noisy, but minor rocksong. Surely the weakest moment of a perfectly nice album. <br />Pablo Honey is definetely quite a catchy album, as a matter of fact.. it's quite uplifting. Really! Although Radiohead wished they never made this album, it's quite a treat for someone who just got into Radiohead. And, quite honestly, it IS Radiohead weakest album to date. <br />But how weak can Radiohead get anyway? If Pablo Honey is part of their weakest material, apparently they can't do ANYTHING wrong.<BR>Try it youself, Pablo Honey's definitely worth the money...<br />Here's my view on the tracks on the album:<br />1: You -&gt; A very interesting opener to this album, definitely one of the album's highlights. Sounds great live too.<br />2: Creep -&gt; The best track on the album. A classic, as one might say. This song alone is worth listening to the album.<br />3: How do you? -&gt; As said, the only weak song on the album... but this is just my opinion. Others might say this is a great tune.<br />4: Stop whispering -&gt; One question: Why hasn't this song been released as an official single? It's a great, powerful, yet timide track. Come on... this is a great tune!<br />5: Thinking about you -&gt; A very emotional, acoustic song about a prostitute. Definitely another highlight. This one is a much better version than the Drill EP version, which is a much rockier one.<br />6: Anyone can play guitar -&gt; Rock at it's best! This one was a classic, back in '93 / '94. Now, sadly, it has been completely forgotten. Pity...<br />7: Ripcord -&gt; A very nice rocksong, but it's not amongt the best songs on Pablo Honey. Still, very nice indeed<br />8: Vegetable -&gt; Yes, more rock! 'I'm not a vegetable, I will not control myself. I spit on the hand that feeds me..' You might call this a rebel song. Or not.<br />9: Prove yourself -&gt; 'I'm better off dead...' This was actually Radiohead's very first single, back in '92. This version, however, is quite an improvement when comparing to the Drill E.P. version. It's got that sing-a-long vibe to it.<br />10: I can't -&gt; This is the favorite track of a friend of mine. It's a very sweet song, though it's probably an easily forgotten one. The lead guitars sounds very good, though.<br />11: Lurgee -&gt; This is the only song, next to Creep, Radiohead might play once in a while nowadays at a gig. It sounds mindblowing live. Very beautiful track.<br />12: Blow out -&gt; This is their most accomplished track on this debut. It's an anthem, though not as great as Creep. Still, this is probably the 2nd best song on the album. The remix (which appeared as a b-side) is even better!

B00000F5KH|5.0|This is a movie about looking for oneself's identity, this is a movie about humanity, if you don't feel touched then go see a psychatrist!  Fernanda Montenegro definetely should have won the Oscar for the best actress award instead of giving it to the lousy Gwyneth Paltrow!  Also, this film is far execellent than the pretentious 'Shakespear in love' and 'Life is beautiful', the juries of Oscar most of the times are either self-protected or BLIND!  'Central Station'is definetely one of the best in the 90s and should have won the best picture and the best foreign film award of that year itself!  A MUST SEE AND OWN MOVIE!!!

0767805712|5.0|The finest film George Orwell did not write, but could have. Orwell's clear message that too much control breaks the human spirit is restated with style and flair that combines the cool hues of a Kubrick space oddysey with the tension of a good film noir detective story. Essential viewing.
B00005M91K|5.0|I was one of the first to buy Baraka on Laser Disc and was dissapointed in the transfer. I was one of the first to buy Baraka on DVD from right here at Amazon.com and was sorely dissapointed by the obvious retransfer of the Laser Disc master.<BR>FINALLY one of the best films I can recommend has been redeemed. The new anamorphic transfer is very well done. The sound is outstanding. I can finally say buy it. Also it seems very timely with recent world events to sit back and see things from a decidedly different perspective...
0812550706|5.0|Pity poor Ender Wiggin, the boy who would be mankind's savior.  Isolated by destiny and his teachers, forced to study and learn the art of war instead of playing the games of childhood, bearing the hopes of mankind on the slight shoulders of his youth; this is Ender's fate.<BR>Despite odds that make David versus Goliath look like a pick 'em fight, Ender not only survives, but thrives.  The Battle Room becomes his sanctuary, enemies become friends, teachers become students.  Destroying the Buggers and ending the threat to Earth occupy everything Ender does, and he finds himself thinking like them, even identifying with them.<BR>Can Ender kill the Buggers?  Save mankind?  Save himself?  In this wonderful example of the writer's craft, Orson Scott Card draws you in, makes you feel Ender's emotional rollercoaster, and delivers a blockbuster look into the very core of the human psyche.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing the video for it, featuring George Clooney. The sound reminded me of the music my father listend to, what he called &quot;real&quot; country, what today is called &quot;hillbilly&quot; music.<br />When I listened to the CD, I was amazed at how much of my father's style of music was there. Big Rock Candy Mountain and You Are My Sunshine, for example. It had been years since I've heard music like this and it finally made me realize why my father loved it so much.<br />The words are pure, the sound is simple and the honesty is bone-deep. Some of the songs I sung loudly (in my Lucille Ball voice). Some made me cry. All of them I listened to over and over and over again.<br />My father died several months ago. I wish so much that I could have given him this CD. He would have sung and cried with me.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  I'm somewhat surprised there are no reviews so far.  Diane Krall has always been my favorite female Jazz vocalist.  She has a mature and soothing voice which one can listens to over and over again and don't get tired of it.  However, over the years, other Jazz female vocalists have emerged and I got drawn to some of them along the way.  Then Diana came out with this CD and wow... let me just say that if you love &quot;when I look into your eyes&quot;, you will love this one even more.  First, the recordings in this CD are exceptionally done: the background orchestration works came out crisp and clear.  Diana's voice is placed slightly in front with authority and appears dead in the centre.  The opening track S'Wonderful put you right in the moods of Diana's world and the tracks get better and better all the way through to the last one.  This CD displayed similar characteristics as her early ones, most noticeably the Bossa Nova tracks.  The differences are found in the background orchestration works which give the music a touch of class over her prior works.  My favorites are: S'Wonderful, I remember you, Besame mucho, Dancing in the dark, and The look of love.  All the tracks are excellent, but the one I mentioned seem to stand out.

0064407667|5.0|I loved the book &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; by Lemony Snicket because of all the horrible things that happened to them. Just when yout thought thinks couldn't get worse, they do! But they make the best of each 'ironic' situation, and makes me love Violet, Klaus, and Sunny all the more. The book is so outrageous, you have to love it. It just gets worse and worse, but better and better. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. It was so funny, i just had to get the next book.
0380788624|5.0|Really. Maybe the reason is because I never tried the super-duper Cap'n Crunch munching methodology described in excruciating detail. Frankly, it sounds like too much work.<br />Stephenson's writing is very much about the details. His memorable explanations of all the different situations facing several characters over two different timelines and three different settings allowed me to pick up and set down this book over nine months. At about 100 pages a month, it's difficult to become attached to the characters involved, but I never lost my way in the story. <br />Frankly, not coming to grips with the character is not that big of a problem with this book. Character definition is not Stephenson's best skill, especially [...] the female characters. Nevertheless, most of the story is told from nerd-centric points-of-view, so the portrayals of women as mysterious and objects of desire is maybe not that inappropriate. Still, Stephenson might have done better to develop a female lead. Also, fans of his work are probably familiar with and reconciled to his crashing endings, but new readers could easily be put off with a conclusion that ends as abruptly as an action movie.<br />Issues of sexism, academia, cryptography and military intelligence, and the contemporary global distribution of techno-wealth are covered glibly, but in far greater detail and with much more thought than in just about any other novel, and most of this stuff is handled in a very entertaining fashion. Stephenson only pulls a few cheap shots, so that the final tone for the book is enlightening, sophisticated with a philosophical underpinning that he spells out rather too-clearly at the conclusion.<br />It is hard to recommend Stephenson's book to just anyone. Anybody that has heard good things about him but doesn't like science fiction should check this out. I would also recommend this book to anyone with a passing interest in at least two of the four topics described above. CRYPTONOMICON was fun read,a refreshing well that I could dip into for almost an entire year, and I'm kind of sad that I won't be able to savor it the same way again.
B00003CWLF|5.0|This has to be one of the best versions of Margaret Landon's book that was published in 1944 from Anna Leonowen's accounts from her regarding her teaching in Siam (Thailand) as a royal school teacher. The other two that I had previous seen over the years were good but somewhere a long the line I didn't enjoy it as much as this one. I don't know probably they found the right place to film the movie, got the sets well presented, the costumes where thoroughly researched and the storyline seem to have been taken into context out of the book instead of it just wondering off dancing or singing whatever I saw in the King and I.<br />Jodie Foster was a great actor in this movie, she was perfect for the role and we could see the emotional side of her which made it more dramatic and not as light-hearted as I though it was supposed to be. There was a seriousness in the air but over all I really liked the role that she played. Chow Yun Fat also played a great king with great expression involved and the manner in speaking as well his Thai I found pretty sharp and good too. However in real life the king would have been around about 60s years old when Anna came to teach the royal court. King Mongkut wouldn't have been this young since he spent most of his life in the monastry and only became king at a late age when his brother died leaving the throne to him. The wives and concubines of the kings were dressed in the exact costumes that I have seen in old photographs in Thailand, therefore showing thorough search and studies went through to try and get everything as accurate as possible. I enjoyed the princes and princess dressed in their court clothes which was very pleasing and wonderful enjoyable.<br />The beginning of the movie was enough, I knew that his movie was going to be better than the others I have seen. The streets with all the busy people, the elephants and the scene where they move from the lower part of the city towards the roofs of houses where you can see the Royal Palace of Bangkok was execellent. Bai Ling playing the role of Tuptim was excellent and she was a very sad character at times but in the trial she was fierce and expressed her other side which was hidden from view showing what she believed in.<br />Overall this movie will make you want to get a box of tissues to wipe your eyes and other times it's serious with a few high-hearted scenes. This is excellent and I wonder if they are going to make another version of this in years to come??? I don't know but I know this will be centre of the stage for a long time before it's replaced. This has lightened and gave a different perception of the movie from the other two which seems to be more focused on Anna and not those all around her.Palace of Bangkok was execellent.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Let me just say first off that Willow is my favorite all time movie.  It's got just about everything you could ever want -- adventure, romance, good vs. evil, heroes big and small, magic and a great setting; as well as trolls, a goat who turns into a woman, and some brownies thrown in for comic relief. The mythic world of the movie is magnificent and the moral of the story -- that everyone holds the power of the universe in his/her own finger --  is really great.  While is movie is not material for the Oscars or Cannes, it is definitely a wonderful story and will appeal to the wide-eyed child in everyone of us.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This album is a great seqel to the State.  The lyrics and beat is great!  Now, Nickelback is one of my favorite bands.  Both of their albums rock.  This group is a extremely underated.  Most of the songs are excellent.  There big hit single &quot;how you remind me&quot; has been played quite a few times on MTV and the radio.  I reccomed buying both of Nickelback's albums.
B00003CY0V|5.0|SWORDFISH is a thrill-machine action movie all the way! The plot concerns a computer hacker who is hired by a antiterrorist to help him hack into a government security computer system and steal $9.5 million in drug money and transfer that into his own computer account. The film also has explosions, car chases, suspense, gun fights, sexy women, and much more! John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, and Halle Berry round out the supporting cast and they all do an outstanding job of playing there characters. I can not wait till this movie comes out on DVD.
B00005O5N1|5.0|This is definately one of the best romantic movies to come out in the past years. Having read both the book and it's sequel I can say with assurance that it feels like a breath of fire has been added to Bridget Jones Diary.<br />Bridget is a single woman who is searching for a guy who is well,..... not psychcotic. In the midst of her search are wonderful friends, a kooky family, and an awful job.<br />This movie is not only romantic and endearing but its funny, the jokes come quick and fast and are filled with wit.Renee Zellweger takes the role and makes it her own creating a funny and quirky modern woman.She is especially humorous when she does any sort of public speaking. <BR>Colin Firth shines as Mr. Darcy and the role fits him like a glove. (Those who have seen the A&amp;E adaptation of Pride and Predjudice will remember him as none other then Mr. Darcy:)<br />The best thing about the movie is just the movie itself, your in no hurry to get from one place to another because the journey itself is so satisfying. Beautiful, Wonderful, and funny, I highly reccomend it!
6305587744|5.0|Winning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor, Forrest Gump speaks for itself as one of the best movies. Played by Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is about a man who grows up in the south. He is not the smartest man, but the movie is a view of his life. Robert Zemeckis, the films director, starts the movie off in present day and then shifts the movie to the past. Growing up in the South, Gump faces issues of growing up and witnessing history in many aspects. He feels many things that goes on with growing up including overcoming a disability, going to college, the Vietnam War, meeting many famous people, loosing friends and family, and the issue of drugs and aids. This movie then shifts to present day where he is at a bus stop. From there it turns into a love story with a new meaning. The movie ends with a good feeling and a brief history lesson from the 1950's to then present day 1994, when the movie was released. If we were to compare it to any other movie, it would be placed next to a documentary. This is a documentary with a new spice and flavor to it that I highly recommend. After watching this movie, you have a good feeling and some new sayings from Forrest Gump, who is a family orientated film. This movie is for a person over the age of 16 who can understand the full concept of the movie and the history behind. I give it an A+.

0553573403|5.0|I've read what Jordan has so far put out in the Wheel of Time Series, Goodkind's series, and several others. But this is the first series that seems like it might get to an end. This book is WONDERFUL. After readin thelast 4 Joradn books I was hoping for something todemand my attention as the first 4 or 5 Joradan books did. I wanted to stay up until 3 in the morning just to see what would happen next. After checking out the top 100 sci-fi books listthat is available online, I figured I should check this out.<br />Turns out, The Song of Ice and Fire series is well worth it. Even your favorite characters could face debilitating injuries or even death. This environment leads to a constant sense of tension. What will happen next? This takes on a whole new meaning when you are used to fantasies where all major characters will always succeed in the end. Another wonderful thing about this series is that you start to wonder who you are really rooting for. You find characters to love on all sides of the conflict for whatever reason. Yes, the story starts with the Stark family, yet Martin helps you understand the motives of the Stark's enemies and as the series progresses you begin to wonder just where your allegiances lie. As the perspectives change between characters, you begin to want almost everyone to succeed.<br />This will be a fantasy mainstay for years and years. The strength of the story-telling and the perfect amount of subpolts will make this a fantasy classic. Read it, and you will fast become a lover of Martin's world.<br />In the end, this is one of the only series I have read (other than the Lord of the Rings and I am sill debating other series) that actually improves with each book. It's the stuff of fantasy.
B00003CX5P|1.0|A short time ago, a group of reviewers picked Phantom Menace as the worst sequel of all times.  Wrong.  It is the worst prequel of all times.  Thin plot (essentially no plot reversals).  The information theory people would say that the predictability of the action makes it an &quot;information-free&quot; medium.  Come on, Mr. Lucas, we've had enough of this insipid fare.  Give up and admit that the first three exhausted your studio's creativity.  Hang up the light sabre.

B00005NWM3|4.0|Great cd. I think it is very similar to their cd &quot;the state&quot;. If you like it you should like this. &quot;how you remind me&quot; is probably the best song on the cd. &quot;Never Again&quot; is an emotional song about domestic violence. Overall i'd have to say i'm disappointed that it only had 10 tracks on it but at least most of them are good.
0399230343|3.0|I normally love the Eric Carle books. My son usually loves them as well. This book is not my favorite, nor is it my son's favorite. I don't feel this is a good representation of his work.<br />The pictures are very cute and the idea is very imaginative.<br />However, the story itself is very clunky and is a bit much for a toddler to sit through. We just look at the pictures and don't try to really read the words.
B0000071J0|5.0|The first Le Orme album I got was Ad Gloriam (1969). That one is basically psychedelic pop (it's pretty fair to say that this was the From Genesis to Revelation of Le Orme, although Ad Gloriam was a better album than the aforementioned Genesis album). The next album I got was Felona e Sorona and I was totally amazed how different this album sounds (for the better). This album is nothing short of a prog rock masterpiece. Often gets compared to ELP, which I can't see why, as they don't remind me much of that band (except the occasional passage). If you're expecting this to sound like ELP, you're better off trying Triumvirat's Illusions on a Double Dimple, or L'Uovo di Colombo's self-entitled 1973 release (which really deserves to be called the Italian ELP). Felona e Sorona is apparently a concept album about two planets that are the complete opposite of each other, but since its all in Italian, I can't be exactly sure what it is all about. All the music flows real nicely into each other, often segued with string synths (people often state Mellotron is used on this album, but I don't notice any). There's two acoustic numbers, while the rest is wonderful keyboard-driven prog. The opener, &quot;Sospesi Nell'Incredibile&quot; is nothing short of amazing, I particularly love those synths near the end with the insane drumming at the end. &quot;Sorona&quot; is a gloomy, atmospheric number that oddly reminds me of how Pulsar (circa Halloween) might have sounded like if they were Italian. Whatever the case, if this album isn't in your collection and you like Italian prog, you need to buy this album without hesitation. It really does live up to the hype.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This was my favorite movie.  It was thrilling.  It shows how drugs can mess you up.  The sountrack was really good too. I think evreryone should see this.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Saw this movie in a video store and was intrigued so I rented it.  It is an incredibly awesome movie about a man; played by Guy Pearce; who is after a man who he believes killed his wife.  There is one minor problem, he cannot create any new memories.  He remembers what happened before &quot;the incident&quot;, but anything after that he forgets almost immediately.<br />The movie starts at the end of the story and goes backward, well sort of.  Each scene picks up earlier and ends where the last one began.<br />Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pagliano (sp?) do some incredibly interesting and awesome acting to help bring the story to life.  This is well worth buying and owning, or at least renting to watch.
0812589041|5.0|I've never been captured by a book before. However this book grabbed my imagination and took me into Ender's world. I felt his pain, his agony, his confusion and a part of his genuis. I was apart of Ender, and Ender was a part of me. When you find yourself in the world of imagination and everything seems so real, yet the only passage way to that world is the book that you are reading, then you know that it is a very good book. Orson Scott Card's book entitled Ender's Game, was a passage for me into my world of imagination. It is a very good book.
0790729350|5.0|What an experience watch \\"Woodstock: The Director's Cut!\\" For the entire 3 hours, 45 minutes of this movie, I was completely transfixed by this spectacular Academy Award winning (Best Documentary, 1970) film, with its (then) ground-breaking multiple image, amorphous widescreen formats. I found myself swept back to 1969, the summer of my 18th year, wistfully longing to be there with the rest of those 500,000-plus \\"hippies\\", listening to the music, partying, being part of that special three-day weekend... As this fully restored DVD version of Wadleigh's masterpiece shows, it was indeed a special event! This film documents the efforts of a group of musicians, entrepreneurs, and financial backers, who worked for over nine months to bring to fruition the history-making rock `n roll music festival that took upstate New York by storm on August 15-17, 1969.<br /><br />With a sure eye for the finest detail, Wadleigh captures hundreds, perhaps thousands, of everyday little incidents, both positive and negative, that made up this special musical event.<br /><br />Using the multi-image format I mentioned earlier, and widescreen formats of varying aspect ratios (the only way this film can be seen without sacrificing substantial portions of it to television's confining 1.33:1 aspect ratio), Wadleigh presents his viewers with powerfully eloquent vignettes:<br /><br />The twenty-mile long traffic jams and the interminably long lines of pedestrians hiking to the site of the concert... The reaction of Bethel's local residents, a few outwardly irate, some mildly irritated, but the vast majority very receptive to the half-million strong horde of \\"hippies\\" descending upon them... The \\"scenes from a disaster area:\\" just how do you provide the basic necessities of sanitation, medical care, and food for a large city camped in a hay field? And what happens when those services are suddenly and arbitrarily stopped?... The countless numbers of people openly passing around joints and pipes and bongs, all getting mightily \\"wasted,\\" while the bands played on... The sudden downpour and almost instantaneous submersion of the multitudes in thick, gooey mud, while the bands tried to play on... and many, many more...<br /><br />And through it all, the heart of the film: the music, always the music. Pure rock and roll as it was meant to be... hard edged, lyrical, harmonious, boisterous, folksy, raucous, raunchy, promoting peace and goodwill, almost religious in its fervor...<br /><br /> ...Richie Havens passionately strumming his battle-scarred acoustic guitar, all the while soulfully belting out his song \\"Freedom...\\" Joan Baez' gentle \\"organizing\\" ballad \\"Joe Hill...\\" The Who kicking up their heels: \\"See me, feel me, touch me, heal me,\\" the opening lyrics of \\"We're Not Gonna Take It Any More,\\" from the rock opera \\"Tommy...\\" A perspiration soaked, gravelly voiced, youthful Joe Cocker putting every ounce of his body and soul into his incredible \\"With a Little Help from My Friends...\\" Jimi Hendrix' incredible, spectacular, pyrotechnical rendition of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" and \\"Purple Haze...\\" and many, many more...<br /><br />I have two complaints about \\"Woodstock: The Director's Cut.\\" First: the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. Throughout the film, there seemed to be a lot of background hiss and crackling. This was probably caused by the equipment Wadleigh used while making the film; however, modern technology still should have been able to eliminate most background noise. My second complaint: The varying aspect ratios (anywhere from 2.35:1 to 1.78:1) make viewing the movie on a standard television a bit difficult. Some images seem very small even on a 32-inch TV! Still, widescreen is the best format to use when viewing this film.<br /><br />It matters not whether you're sixteen or sixty; whether you've never been to a rock concert in your life, or you're a grizzled old concertgoer like me; \\"Woodstock: The Director's Cut\\" is a film not to be missed!bongs, all getting mightily \\"wasted,\\" while the bands played on...

0790701251|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's (full metal jacket) is based from Gustav Hasford's gory &amp; obscure novel (short-timers). A two part film,the first dealing with a marine bootcamp,and the second centering on Vietnam during the 1968 Tet Offensive. Bleak,Ironic,and perversely funny. This film offers little hope &amp; even less humanity. The first part, is the most riveting pieces of film I've ever seen. You tend to feel numb as it fades into the second half. Making the viewer feeling a bit let down. I'ts not as strong as the first, it's a bit detached and unstructured. But I think that was the intent. The film shows a surreal view of combat. The film's climax is both suspenseful and very haunting. The last image of the marines walking through a burned out city is both bizzare and unforgettable. Superb direction,cinematography,acting, and great sound, ( the sounds of distant explosions &amp; gunfire) are just one example. The music is both conventional and eerie. This is Stanley Kubrick's best film.

B00005NW02|5.0|I was a little bit skeptical before buying this cd last week. I wasn't too much of a fan of 'Sugar' which was a big hit a couple years ago, so I at first dismissed System as another [...] MTV band. Hearing 'Chop Suey!' on the radio over the summer gave me second thoughts. I'm going to give the first cd a well-deserved second chance now.<br />I bought the cd, put it in, then 'Prison Song' hit right away. The opener is probably one of the best, if not the best song on the cd. It's a very hard, upbeat song dealing with the drug war and prison systems. This cd has its fast parts (Prison Song, Deer Dance, X), its slow parts (Chop Suey! ATWA, Aerials), and its weird and kooky parts (Bounce, Shimmy, Psycho) that made them what they were before, and made the fast faster, the slow slower, and the kooky kookier. They experiment a lot of different time signatures and tempo changes, as well as using different levels of guitar distortion. From heavy distortion to clean electric, to acoustic. Serj Tankian switches his vocal setting many times during the cd....often many times during one song. From crooning, to screaming, to singing very very quicky (first couple verses of 'Prison Song', chorus of 'Psycho'. He's also penned some very good lyrics which have some truth behind them and are fun to sing along with. About every instrument is noteworthy from Daron's guitar, and Shavo's bass, to John's hard and fast drumming. The use of keyboards is also evident on a couple songs ('Chop Suey!', 'Aerials').<br />The bonus disc includes footage from live shows and backstage. Also a \\"Making Of\\" feature with more behind the scenes stuff. This is a very diverse cd full of lots of different sounds and tempos. It's refreshing in this sad \\"verse, chorus, verse\\" to have some different stuff. I'd recommend this to just about anyone who is looking for a break from rap metal and manufactured \\"nu-metal\\".
B000002OX5|4.0|1967 yeilds another classic album with Sell Out, and it seems to have a common ground with other albums of that year, the opening track sounds like Syd Barretts Pink Floyd, and there are hints of Sgt Pepper type effects. But most of all, the album is a new direction for the who, they step away from the hard edged R&amp;B that they used on A Quick One, and emerge with a psychadelic pop/rock album, and in my mind that is a great combo. The concept of a radio station is loads of fun as well. Townshends Odorono, is a perfect parody of those songs that you hear and enjoy, that turn out to just be commercial gimics! And while churning out tons of pop songs on the album they still stand out as the Who, Moons drumming would never let them become an ordinary pop group, and the lyrics are not typical pop material, they all have either a funny story, a serious story (with a comical punchline), or a progressive sequence of events, like Glow Girl or Rael. This album would later merge perfectly with A Quick One to form Tommy, the sometimes aggressive and sometimes poppy rock story. This album is a must for any fan, and a landmark in the sixties rock scene. It falls in with the likes of Sgt Pepper, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Are you Experienced, Strange Days, Disraeli Gears and Days of Future Past; all great albums of 1967.

0446677450|1.0|If you are seriously considering buying this book, take a few minutes to consider carefully why you are about to do so. If you are looking for financial advice, I suggest you look elsewhere. Not only did I find Kiyosaki's book vague and repetitive, but I also seriously questioned some of the advice he gives. At one point in the book (that is if he is telling the truth), Kiyosaki admits to insider trading. If you know anything about the stock market, you know that this is TOTALLY ILLEGAL! After seeing this, I decided to llok up some information about Kiyosaki online. The results were not good. ... Good luck in your financial future. I hope you can find a better book to guide you.

B00005LMBK|4.0|I heard Clint Eastwood on the radio this morning on my way to work.  The bass HITS and it's got very catchy lyrics that really flow.  I got to work and checked out the rest of the songs from the album on .mp3.  Hooked, especially Dracula.  I just got back from the corner store after buying the CD.  If you are looking for a new sound and are in to urban alternative, this is the stuff.<br />4 instead of 5 stars goes to the recording quality - it is intentionally scratchy to make it sound a bit more old schoolish, but gets on my nerves.  The bass track comes through very clean though.
B000002KP3|5.0|Yeah, I'm not sure that the lyrics of BANG A GONG mean anything literally, but you know as well as I that they convey the essence of lust better than any others.  Set those lyrics to an incredible and original groove, and voila!-a CLASSIC!  The whole album is great, but BANG A GONG alone is worth the price of admission-one of the greatest R-N-R songs of all time.  Marc Bolan was a true original.  Plus, the album cover is one of the all time best at conveying the spirit of R-N-R: a guy, a guitar, and a stack o' amps!.
B00003CXA4|4.0|I despise biopics. I really do. They tend to do a few things: allow actors to get lazy by just emulating the famous persons they're playing, grab Oscar noms (and wins) from far more deserving and interesting performances, and they tend to be uninspired as movies, just a vehicle for an astounding performance. Gandhi is such a film. That being said, Ben Kingsley is astounding as the Mahatma, delivering more than just an impersonation, but rather a truly felt performance. However, this movie is one you see once and admire for the technical aspects and the sweeping story and never see again. My advice to you: rent the film, don't buy it.    Now, this film was one of the more erroneous Oscar picks. In the same year, a movie was released that was a breath of fresh air to cinema. That movie, Blade Runner, didn't even receive a nomination for Best Picture, probably because the Academy didn't honor those kinds of films until recently. Blade Runner was thrilling, visionary, a stunning spectacle, but also a very clever story about immortality, perception, reality, and the future. It dared a lot, and it created an utterly compelling future L.A., which was pretty much another character in the movie. Blade Runner was exciting, this movie was an exercise in playing it safe, and it won, of course, because the Academy loves biopics. It kills me. In terms of style, entertainment, and substance, Gandhi loses out to Blade Runner. What the heck are the voters looking for? Anyway, this stodgy, conventional film should please biopic lovers, you demeted preverts.

0374172897|3.0|At one point in his novel THE HOURS Michael Cunningham uses the image of the Venus Flytrap to illustrate the dilemma of one of his characters, a poet named Richard who is dying of AIDS. First the flower lures you in and then its sharp &quot;teeth&quot; close over you and suck out your life's juices. At the end of THE HOURS I felt as if I had been lured into the book and drained of emotion, if not life juices.<br />I often read books that win prestigious prizes because I believe literary experts who know a good deal more about literature than I do serve on the panels that award prizes and I might be better informed if I try to read some of their choices. Often the experience of reading a prize-winning book is a delight (THE SHIPPING NEWS). Sometimes it is powerful (A THOUSAND ACRES, COLD MOUNTAIN). And sometimes the prize winning book isn't as good as the runner-up.<br />THE HOURS is extremely well written, and for that reason alone you may want to read it. Cunningham certainly shares some of his insights about the frustrating business of creative writing. However, THE HOURS is not a 5-star book from my perspective.<br />Cunningham combines three short stories into the one novel. He cleverly links not only the lives of his protagonists, but as another reveiwer has indicated, he links various illusions and aspects such as color. As a gardener, I noted the placement of roses in each of the tales--roses surround the dead thrush; roses missalinged and destroyed on the birthday cake; roses in the apartment of the poet dying of AIDS. This linking is seamless and at times beautiful.<br />However I want character development when I read a novel and I found Cunningham's characters a bit one-dimensional. One would expect more emphasis on plot in a short story--and this book consists of three short stories with three cleverly interwovan plots.<br />Although I appreciate the innovation of her work very much and feel she was overlooked by critics who latched onto James Joyce and ignored her because she was a woman writer, I have never particularly liked Woolfe's books. I read MRS DALLOWAY during a course I took on women writers (and afterward I read the remainder of her books). I've also read several biographies about Woolfe, including Quentin Bell's VIRGINIA WOOLFE:A BIOGRAPHY. (Bell appears briefly in THE HOURS).<br />The evidence from Bell's biography and another biography by Louise de Salvo, is that Virginia Woolfe was a victim of familial incest. The residual stress from her childhood encounters with older abusive brothers, the stress of losing several loved ones in quick succession in her early adult years, the destruction of the young men of her generation during WWI, and the disasters of WWII appear to played a major role in driving her mad.<br />When Virginia Woolfe walked into the Ouse, she had been bombed out of her London home and faced a bleak uncertain future in war-torn England. Leonard Woolfe was Jewish, and they both feared an invasion since their &quot;country&quot; home lay not far from the South coast of England and they knew what the NAZIs were doing to Jews. Many things affected her already fragile mind the day she packed her coat pockets with stones and waded into the river.<br />None of this information is revealed in THE HOURS. I can imagine someone reading THE HOURS, not knowing Woolfe's background, and thinking her a vain, shallow, and unstable aristocrat who had little serious regard for anyone. In reality, she was a deeply passionate and caring individual who knew too much sorrow. Knowing this, one must wonder about the other women in Cunningham's novel.d ignored her because she was a woman writer, I have never particularly liked Woolfe's books.

B00003CXZ4|2.0|The director went out of his way to make what could have been a decent movie into a confusing disjointed mess.
B00000IUT7|3.0|I bought the toy for my 4-year old son, who already have played a lot with BRIO trains. But the Action Locomotive arrived defective: the noise and light worked, but the machine did not. Amazon.com replaced the toy. Although this time it worked fine, I realized that the locomotive was not capable of climbing bridges, which was very frustrating for my son. And frustrating for me was the fact that the batteries last only a couple of hours of (non-continuous) playing. I have to replace them every 3 or 4 days!
B000002AGN|5.0|Widely regarded as the Brubeck quartet's pinnacle, Time Out began as an experimental album, featuring odd time signatures, but yielded two instant classics -- Blue Rondo' and Take Five -- complemented with other selections that are just as satisfying. Brubeck's piano and Wright's bass set the tempo so effectively that the listener is left to wonder why 5/4, 9/8 and other non-standard meters had been ignored for so long. It never gets old, and there is not a bad track among them. In fact, while 'Take Five' is something of a legendary performance, it is remarkable that everything before and after more than holds its own.<br />As another reviewer has noted, Time Out is accessible music. Desmond's sax never overpowers, and Brubeck is at once creative and technically impressive. Time Out works well as a complete experience, so that you will want to listen through to the excellent last track and appreciate it as a whole. The recording quality and liner notes are typical Columbia -- which is to say first rate.<br />In this case, the 'essential recording' label is spot on. If you have even a passing interest in jazz, this belongs in your collection.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|There is no album I can think of that can match the perfection of several levels of &quot;Love and Theft&quot;. Lyrically,musically, and yes vocally, no recording succeeds on three levels to such a spectacular level. The blues groove of &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; may be the most exciting backing track I've ever heard.Simultaneously hilarious, mysterious, and deeply moving, this recording is one for the ages. Thank you and bless you Bob for such a gift. Now how about a live album from your Neverending Tour. Your band is the best!
B00005LMBK|5.0|Couldn't stop singing Clint Eastwood, so I just bought it without hearing any other of the songs. Very diverse cd- not another song like Clint Eastwood- there's a mix of rap, techno, fusion, &amp; alternative. Definitley a good one for anyone who wants to try something new. After all, I think we've all had enough of that &quot;JLO&quot; girl for a while.
B00005KHJT|5.0|Wow!What can I say ,this is one awesome DVD.Ever since my brother introduced me to HALLOWEEN on vhs when it was released many years ago I have not looked back...Whoever came up with the idea of these DVD releases ,keep them coming.I just returned my brothers original HALLOWEEN vhs after having it for years.The new HALLOWEEN extra added footage is so good 'it makes the movie already great, that much more better.Those scenes make the movie whole.DONALD PLEASENCE is a great actor as is Jamie lee curtis.JOHN CARPENTER/DEBRA HILL made in my opinion the greatest horror,thriller,suspense movie in our generation!Can't wait for HALLOWEEN 8.So for now lock your doors,turn out the lights and put in the new HALLOWEEN EXTENDED VERSION.
B00005O5JV|5.0|Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't going to win any Academy Awards in the near future, but it doesn't mean that it isn't good. Perhaps, a little unrealistic (i.e., a fashion major getting into Harvard Law School), but Withersppon shines and her costars feed off her. It hints of &quot;Clueless,&quot; yet is far smarter. After getting dumped by her boyfriend, Elle Woods decides that the only way to win him back is to follow him to Harvard Law School. However, she finds that this is not sunny California; there are no sororities or luaus. No one cares about Prada, Fendi, or Dolce and Gabbana. She also finds that her ex-boyfriend has found someone else, someone more &quot;serious.&quot; Elle, soon learns that serious doesn't come from changing your &quot;signature color&quot; from pink to black, but from studying and self-understanding. It's a classic coming-of-age story, presented in a fun and classy manner.<BR>So it's not Casablanca or Citizen Kane, but it's entertaining. I'd definitely recommend it.
0792151712|1.0|Titanic may have cool looking special effects but other than that it's just a waste of time. it starts off with the fictional love story between a guy named jack and a girl named rose. and when you watch it unfold you get a been there seen that type of feeling which you have throughout the movie. Also, the movie didn't focus on the real people that died or lived through the sinking of the titanic which people would like to see &amp; learn more about. I say just watch the second tape or watch terminator  1&amp;2 or the abyss that's james cameron at his best
0140437312|5.0|Among other writers of Victorian classics, Wilkie Collins is one rarely talked of. While most of us have read some Dickens, Hardy, Bronte etc, Collins's novels are often left out. However, along with Anne Bronte, Wilkie Collins is one of the finest little-known writers of all time.<BR>    The Woman in White is his masterpiece. Intricate plotting, a range of of both likeable and complex characters and the positioning of various narratives combine to make this a compelling read. Reminding me of Dracula, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and even Rebecca, this book is as gripping as any other you're likely to read. I wholeheartedly recommend it. <BR>    Many have said that this was the first detective mystery; doubtless it is one of the finest.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I'll admit it--I have NOT seen the movie yet. I wanted to see it in the theater (mostly to see Ewan!) but 14 year olds only have so much control over what they get to do. I plan on renting it, though. Anyway my friend let me borrow the soundtrack and I LOVE almost every song! I litteraly JUST got done listening to it. In fact I'm listening to # 11 (Come What May) right now! Man, I always liked Ewan's speaking voice, but I just LOVE listening to him sing! I've heard better singers, of course, but I still find his voice irrisistible and beautiful. I plan on buying it as soon as possible. I can't wait to see the movie! If you buy this CD you won't be sorry! It's great!
B000002LEM|4.0|I am not particularly a Van Halen or David Lee Roth fan - however, I liked what Sammy Hagar brought to the band - serious soaring vocals and balls.  OU812 represents Eddie Van Halen at his guitar peak - there isn't a note out of place here and Eddie gets to riff on slower and faster songs.  People who rate Eddie by his speed and explosive killer licks may miss out on that point.  OU812 is a listenable and enjoyable album in its entirety. The best tracks here are &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot; and &quot;Black and Blue&quot; - tremendous guitar dynamics as Eddie finds his slow burn groove and nails his sweet spots. I'm really impressed by the production quality on the guitar.  This is an album that will have to grow on you - it won't blow you away on a first listen.  It's more polished than 5150 but not as explosive.  This may not be for every Van Halen fan - but it seems that everyone's pretty divided when it comes to evaluating the band anyway.  Sadly, and I agree with the reviewer below - Van Hagar just wasn't the same after this.  For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge - although being a commercial hit for the band as their next album - was dreadful and uninspired.
B00003CXQX|4.0|The Emperor didn't get as much applause as he deserved.  David Spade is his usual selfish jerk character--except this time he's animated!  John Goodman has basically taken the place of Chris Farley.  I think that it's Disney's best since Toy Story.  And though they won't make as much of a profit without a soundtrack, I LOVE the fact that there is no music.  Finally an animated movie with a script that stands alone!
B00001OH80|3.0|As other reviews here put - this album represented Bowie's lost years in the 80s.  The days when he would go into studio and perform but show none of his edge except for a few good songs here and there.  That's the key word that people come to expect from Bowie - cutting edge.  This one is blunt for some, and for me was Bowie-lite.  I still listen to it now and then and know the album well.  It doesn't quite hit the mark, but I listen to it because I treat it as the man playing around - not being too serious about it.  The choice of songs is questionable but not unlistenable.  More covers than originals.  If you are a Bowie fan and want to add this into your collection, I would say go ahead.  But don't hold Bowie to his usual standards of musical integrity.
B00000099Y|5.0|After this long, I consider this album nothing short of a major landmark in metal.  The drumming is precise and intricate, the bass is powerful, and the vocals are not only beautiful but the lyrics are often ingenius.  Adam Jones has been criticized alot for not seeming to add up as Tool's guitarist, but I think the problem is that Tool aren't interested in being a &quot;jam&quot; band.  They don't need guitar solos and catchy riffs, just APPROPRIATE riffs and metered excursions.  Tom Morello put it best when he said that Adam Jones is a great guitarist because he doesn't try to be- he knows how to drain all the B.S. out of the songs.  <br />Tool's live show, as well, is incredible.  I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys a great live &quot;experience&quot; see them.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|I loved rthis movie it was so hilarious. tthe best people in the movie are the bunnies and the reaper. i would recomend there seconfd hit bill and teds excellent adventure when they go bac in time for there science report to get some historical figures dor there report at san demis high school. Bill and teds bogus adventure is a type of oldschool jokes and a love for there rock group the wild stalions. i reccomend this movie to any teenager.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool, a band that is progression personified, has left their previous albums in the dust with the release of Lateralus. A collection of tracks 78 minutes long and anticipated since 1996, Lateralus engages and hypnotizes for its entire duration. I can find nary a flaw in this latest venture by Maynard &amp; Co.<BR>The big thing in the album is the advancement of Tool's content. While most of their stuff has been consistantly original, it has also been a bit redundant. Tool manages to mix things up in this album while also making everything flow. Listening to this album can be most readily compared to looking at a Salvador Dali painting: It's strange and complicated, and requires you to think, but in the end, it is an enchanting and, if nothing else, memorable experience.<BR>Tool seems to not only have surpassed nima audibly, but lyrically as well. The words in the songs come together amazingly with the music to produce a vibrant mental image as you listen. Perhaps this is because the lyrics on this album are so visual. The songs truly must be heard to be appreciated; most of them just defy description.<BR>And of course, the ending tracks are no exception, regardless of what some may have said. &quot;Disposition&quot; serves up an eerily mellow treat to ease you into &quot;Reflection,&quot; what I believe to be the most powerful track on the album.<BR>Not to mention, the Art Bell radio program makes a nice appearance near the end.
B00005NB0H|5.0|This reissue sounds even a bit better than the 1994 reissue. The bass thumps up side your head, the drums trample, and the guitar smashes like the ocean on the rocks. Good Job. The addition of the Tommy Live disc, which is a great performance of the &quot;Rock Otter&quot;, is worth the upgrade to this edition. Having heard the entire show several years back in an unofficial release, this is definitely a treat to finally have it released to the masses in great quality. Diehards might complain that the show is not in the original concert sequence, but I like the splitting out of Tommy to it's own disc so that it can be listened to in it's entireity. Well worth the investment.
B000005RFQ|5.0|Born Again is simply the most underrated rock/metal albums, let alone the least thought of sabbath album. Well think again, 'cos here you will find some of the heaviest tracks ever committed to vinyl. Standout tracks include TRASHED, the awesome DISTURBING THE PRIEST, the amazing title track, and the monumental riff that is ZERO THE HERO. The whole album has such an unusual atmosphere, the like of which I've neither heard before or since, it's simply impossible to describe. Forget all the talk about the production values, it all adds to the experience. This album will never fail to get you going.
B00005N9CV|3.0|It seems Diana's career now takes the road to over-produced self-indulgence. The jacket liner is an elaborate fold-out shaped like a cross with no less than NINE glamour portraits of the Canadian &quot;torch singer.&quot; But you needn't be satisfied with just that -- the inside and back of the CD cover provide us with two more, for a grand total of TEN images of Diana. Wow; here I thought she was a musician/vocalist. <br />Somewhere inside all that are ten songs (oh, now I get it -- a picture for each!), most tending toward light Latin bossa nova. Sorta. The title track, which nearly prevented my purchasing the CD in the first place, I had always loathed since I heard Sergio Mendes try it in the mid '60s, was it? Ugh. I don't know of a more cheezy piece, and even Ms. Krall is unable to supply redemption. If you're not into bossa nova, you'll most likely find the titles &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; begging you to hit the fast-forward button on your CD player. <br />The good news is that there are some very worthy pieces. Ms. Krall's sensitive treatment of &quot;Love Letters&quot;, &quot;S'Wonderful&quot;, &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well&quot;, will not disappoint, and in my mind, justify purchasing the CD. Don't expect substance in every song, and you'll most likely find yourself satisfied with this CD.
0380973464|4.0|Stephenson has developed a book which tells the early beginnings of the computer, the ins/outs of cryptography, and a character story with adventure.<br />What more could you want?? But beware if technical details make your head spin, because this book is full of them!
B00001ZULV|4.0|It's too hard to compress a representative enough sample of the best music that a band pulled together in 30 years of work, and the attempt of a greatest hits album of Genesis is no exception to this.<br />But the main problem this album has is not that it's not enough to showcase the best work of the band. It's that it's focused on the later work of the band, with only &quot;I know what I like&quot; and a new version of &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot; taken from the Peter Gabriel period of the band (1969 - 1975). While it's true that back then the band was not a generator of hits as it was during the Collins era, the album totally overlooks some truly outstanding works of the band such as &quot;The Musical Box,&quot; &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; and &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; just to name three: I guess their absence can only be justified in terms of their lenghts, which would have made the resulting album consist of far less songs or be double.<br />Anyway, I give it four stars, because regardless of all of the above, all the songs that made it to the album are great songs.
B000002MP2|5.0|Dookie is, without a doubt, one of the best cd's of all time.  I like a lot of different kinds of music, but punk is one of my favorites, and this cd is incredible.  It is one of those albums that keep getting better and better the more you listen to it (rather than more boring like so many cds).  Contrary to a lot the preceding reviews, Blink 182's Enema of the State is also a great album, so I recommend that too.
B000002LFZ|4.0|This was the first Fleetwood Mac album I bought, some years ago. As such, it was a wonderful introduction to the realm of the band, at least its Buckingham-Nicks lineup (without a doubt their most successful period, and arguably their greatest creatively). Contains the whole gamut of hits, &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; &quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; &quot;Little Lies,&quot; yada yada yada. And if you're new to FM, or only know their Rumours stuff (as was my case), this really is a good start. You get to hear Fleetwood Mac at their most radio-friendly, without some of the other aspects of each songwriters' talent that might take some time to adjust to (Stevie's six-minute cosmic rants, Lindsey's insanity). You miss out on a lot (I had no concept of TUSK from hearing this album), there are a couple curious omissions (where's &quot;The Chain?&quot;), and a band such as Fleetwood Mac really deserves to have its entire catologue heard (otherwise you'd miss gems like &quot;That's Alright&quot; and &quot;World Turning&quot;), but it is a good CD, and as one guy pointed out, a great party album. The two new songs are pleasent, nothing exceptional-- &quot;As Long As You Follow&quot; has a great melody and catchy guitar solo, but the production is a little watered-down in light of the sonic collages from TANGO. However, this is really a great intro to Fleetwood Mac-- and actually, I found this compilation better represented the B-N era of the band than THE CHAIN box set. Go buy it!!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Once again, Bob Dylan has astonished all those small minded individuals that ignorantly had written him off in the past.  Love and Theft is a fantastic swirling love affair with the history of American music.  He touches base with the roots of music that he has so majestically utilized in his own unique and brilliant style.  Is it possible that Dylan is getting better as he advances in age?  Listening to L&amp;T leaves me to answer in the affirmative.  Let's all hope that Bob has many other albums to bless us with in the future.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Honest album. For those who didn't get it the first time, listen again. The first album was great, Is great, but this one grew on me and will not get off. Great songs, arrangements, production.The first one had Jim Keltner and Van Dyke pArks, Jon Brion, etc, producing so, Can hardly beat the production. Poses sounds Like a million, rather than 3 like the first. Really appreciate the real deal these days with all the garbage being forced onto the public. Cigarrettes and Chocolate Milk, poses, Who will keep me in this evening, watch my head about it. These songs rotate in my head until I force another album on to stop it. Morning comes, another Poses song.. Great album if it sticks like that. Don't overlook the brilliant piano parts. If you read this Rufas. Great job, Good luck with The Tori Amos shows, Heard San Diego was awesome. Keep up the good work and keep healthy, thanks for the inspiration
B00003652R|5.0|Misplaced Childhood is an emotional album that has provided immense comfort to my soul.  I find the raw life of Fish's haunting voice - coupled with the magical melodies - to be intoxicating.<br />Many people reach for their comfort food in times of stress.  Others drugs or alcohol.  For me, it's Misplaced Childhood.  I find that my stress dissipates quickly and a calm washes over me.<br />This album is pure genius.<br />Easily my number 1 or 2 album should I ever find myself on a deserted island! ;-)<br />Take my word for it - you'll be relieved of life's burdens and transported ...
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks is without a doubt a classic Rock n' Roll icon first and foremost. Secondly, the last 7 songs on the album completly balance and support the beginning of the album. Fall From Grace is the Rock equivalent to Edge of Seventeen, not the age-old &quot;Baby why don't you love me anymore?&quot; song.  That Made Me Stronger, again not a &quot;Baby why don't you love me anymore?&quot; song. Bombay Saphires, although a song about love is not an obvious one, besides it shows Stevie expanding into a different genre with a Caribbean feel to it. This album went Gold within a month of its release date, and is Stevie's best work in years. IT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED!
0517123207|2.0|The firs two chapters of The Origin are titled: Variation Under Domestication and Variation Under Nature. Therein lays the main argument behind Darwin's view. Darwin observed how organisms vary in nature and he observed how man had harnessed this ability for man's own benefit. Darwin referred to this trait as artificial selection, which was the basis for Darwin's dangerous idea or extrapolation: Natural Selection. With natural selection however, Darwin, proclaimed it an unguided, random process that had no real purpose. Artificial selection is nothing of this sort though. Artificial Selection is an intellectual guided, predetermined event. In fact, it is more appropriately called Intelligent Selection, since knowledge is used to carefully select those traits that can be beneficial to man. <br />In Intelligent Selection, nothing is left to chance; farmers did not and have not relied on randomness to maximize their crops output. They have always used knowledge and skill. Darwin used Intelligent Selection for establishing the basis of natural selection, proclaiming that he named it natural selection &quot;in order to mark its relation man's power of selection.&quot; Pg 53 However, since Intelligent Selection requires knowledge, order, and guidance it can hardly be used to support Darwin's dangerous extrapolation: Natural Selection, a random, unguided process. Darwin repeatedly says that if man could do so much in his short time-span, than imagine what Nature could do through it's long time-span: &quot;I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of coadaptions between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by NATURE'S POWER OF SELECTION.&quot; Pg 91 However since Intelligent Selection is so different, or even more accurately the opposite of Natural Selection, it cannot be used as evidence for Darwin's dangerous extrapolation. Thus, Darwin's chief example for his theory is null and void. <br />Chapters 3 thru 8 deal with specific examples of descent with modification found inside nature. To help clarify, the examples that Darwin gives are not in question. In fact, the ideas concerning populations that Darwin borrowed from Malthus, the struggle for existence that organisms go through, and many of the other examples that Darwin covers are not being questioned. What IS being questioned is the extrapolations that Darwin made that went past the evidence. Scientists observe that organisms vary in nature; Scientists observe that descent with modification occurs within nature. NO ONE doubts this. But rather the objections to Darwin's work are because his claims goes PAST the evidence. Scientists know that organisms can vary, but they ALSO know there is a limit to the amount of variation that can go into any organisms (called genetic homeostasis). There is a point of no return, where the variations start to have an overtly negative effect. To say that creatures have the ability to vary in nature is true, however to proclaim that nature can do what man has not been able to due goes beyond what the evidence tells us. In fact, it goes AGAISNT the evidence; it goes AGAINST science. <br />Chapters 9-12 are devoted to the subject geology and geographical distribution of organisms. Darwin owed much credit to Charles Lyell, who gave Darwin the vast amount of time needed for natural selection to supposedly work. Darwin proclaimed that &quot;the future historian&quot; would recognize Lyell's book the Principle of Geology &quot;as having produced a revolution in natural science&quot; pg 232 Yet, Lyell's view of a gradual, non catastrophic, uniform geological rate has been rejected. Even today's most ardent evolutionists have conceded that catastrophes have vastly shaped today's earth. Darwin however believed the opposite. He relied greatly on the theory of uniformatarianism being the absolute truth and even declared that &quot;species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes.&quot; Pg 398 Thus, Darwin's view on the geological record is mistaken. Catastrophes have had a great deal to do with the formation of the earth and on the production and extermination of organisms. <br />Darwin devotes Chapter 13 to talking about embryology and how the facts of embryology alone would be enough to convince him that evolution were true. (pg 374) But yet, studies in embryology since Darwin's time have not strengthened evolution. There are just too many examples where the embryo does not repeat the stages of his past ancestors. The human embryo for example develops its tongue at an early stage in their development, but it is only when the child is a few months old that they starts growing teeth. Yet, our supposed ancestors are said to have evolved their teeth first and then their tongue. Moreover, the idea that a human embryo goes from a single cell organism, to a fish, an amphibian, a mammal, a monkey, and then a human has been demonstrational shown to be false. (See the works of Embryologist Wayne Friar for further info) Anyone who still sticks to this old argument, is no longer dealing with science, but have entered the realm of the dogma, where evidence and reason takes a back seat. <br />Charles Darwin has become synonymous with evolution. But why? He didn't reveal any new ideas in the Origin. (The idea that organisms shared common ancestry and that the earth was extremely old had been around for a while. Ancient Greek philosophers had similar speculations.) So, what was so different about Darwin? Why do people associate Charles Darwin with evolution and not Alfred Wallace, Charles Lyell, Thomas Huxley, or even Charles's grandfather Erasmus. The answer, although in no way a short one, can be partly attributed to his attempt to rid special creation from the scientific throne. In its place instituting a naturalist paradigm, that ever since has hindered science. Before Darwin, along the time of Galileo, the dogma came from the religious sect. But, since Darwin's time the dogma has switched sides, or at least superficially. The dogma still comes from the religious sect mind you, but a religious sect masquerading around as science. In short, Darwin is synonymous with evolution not because of his scientific contribution but because of his adherence to a naturalistic philosophy, which in the words of Richard Dawkins &quot;made it possible to be an intellectual fulfilled atheist&quot;.

B000002J2D|4.0|OK, many of you will say &quot;What about 'Duke'?&quot;, and I'll answer that it has many great songs, but to me, it's teetering on the fence between Genesis' incredible progressive rock past, and Phil Collin's Jekyll-and-Hyde-like transformation from enjoyable vocals to near-screaming on some songs on later albums like &quot;Abacab&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot; (see 'Mama', for example).  In my opinion, the greatest Genesis albums are (in no particular order) &quot;Selling England By the Pound&quot;, &quot;...And Then There Were Three&quot;, &quot;Trick of the Tail&quot;, and - perhaps the best - &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot;.<br />&quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; is a nice song, but it's the only one on this album that foreshadow's Genesis's future.  The rest of the album hews close to the fantastic progressive rock sound of &quot;Trick...&quot; and &quot;Wind...&quot;, despite the loss of Hackett.  &quot;Burning Rope&quot;, &quot;Snowman&quot;, and many others are standouts.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is a truly remarkable album. I had no idea who SOAD was until I heard the song needles at a friends house. I was amazed! Serj has such a unique vocal palette, and the lyrics are great. This band strikes me as odd how they sing some of their songs, as if they were merely speaking, but i think this is unique, and easily an adding factor to the experience. it's things like that that make bands unique. This CD should not be missed. there is no filler, and every song is good and has a place. Needles, prison song, deer dance, and toxicity are my all around favorite songs. Go out and buy it!
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. It is the story of friendship,time,and most importantly, hope. <br />Andy Dufresne, played superbly by Tim Robbins, is a man sent to prison for the alleged muder of his wife and her lover. While in prison, he meets Red, who is played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. The unlikely friendship that forms between these two men who come from such diverse backgrouds is a part of what makes this movie so incredible. They become each others best friend and confidant; something that everyone in prison could use.<br />Another element that plays such a key role in this movie is that of time. Not only does this movie span over twenty years, but time itself plays a key role in the plot of the movie. Although the time Andy spends in prison takes away a large portion of his life,in the end you might want to call it his best friend.<br />The music of this movie is what ties all the emotional elements together. Thomas Newman does an amazing job with the soundtrack. His music transports you to the movie's place and time. It has the power to make you feel what the characters are experienceing. It also progresses chronologically to stay with the changing years.<br />But the one elment that makes this movie so truly remarkable is the theme of hope. It gives us something to be excited about and reminds us to continue to hope in our everyday lives. Never does Andy Dufresne lose hope that he will survive his struggle. Red, on the other hand, thinks hope is a dangerous thing. But Andy pursists and wins Red over by the end of the film. I think Andy says it best when he states, &quot;Hope is a good thing. Maybe even the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.&quot;
B000002AS1|1.0|Most of these reviews are NOT for the Silvestri cd shown above. Instead, most of these reviews are for the cd that contains a collection of thirty-two songs by various artists. The Silvestri cd contains mostly instrumental selections.
B000000Y87|5.0|This album represents half of the tracks recorded on that holy day in jazz in June of 1961.  Acquiring the other half requires purchase of &quot;Waltz for Debbie.&quot;  But the 1986 CD &quot;At the Village Vanguard&quot; (not &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot;) is a quite satisfying compilation of the best material from both albums (including &quot;I Loves You Porgy,&quot; which was not released on the original vinyl).  If nothing fewer than two Bill Evans will do you, spend the remainder on &quot;The Paris Concert.&quot;
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall's new &quot;The Look Of Love&quot; offering is a smooth sultry winner. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed. Latin inspired numbers are especially addictive, such as &quot;Besame Mucho&quot;. The London Symphony Orchestra adds lushness and fullness to Diana's smoky easy renderings. A great addition to your collection!
B00005N9CV|5.0|As a seasoned D.K. listener, I have to say that this is her most sophisticated album to date.  Gone are the uptempo tunes like &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot;, only to be replaced by the smooth &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;.  Diana's rendition of &quot;I Remember You&quot;, set to a Bossanova beat, is the best I've heard yet.  Also, Diana's cover of &quot;Maybe You'll Be There&quot; evokes in the listener the longing of parted lovers, and makes your heart ache it's so beautiful. Overall, I think this is Diana's best album, highlighting her ability to convey heartbreak, lust and joy in one beautifully packaged voice.
B00000AFGM|4.0|Marilyn Manson gets better and better with each album that they release, and the same can be said for this album.  My favourite tracks are The Dope Show, Rock Is Dead, Post Human, I Want To Dissapear and User Friendly. If are a fan of the previous albums then you must own this album
B00003CX6P|5.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley: rated R, 2 hours and 15 minutes<br /> One of the years most anticipated movies, not surprisingly also turns out to be one of the years best. A true ensemble cast that is virtually flawless in performance defines The Talented Mr. Ripley. <BR>When we first meet the films anti-hero (in the true meaning of the word), he is feigning his identity as a well-respected Princeton graduate in hope of impressing his audience at a piano recital. In actuality, Mr. Ripley is just your average Joe. As the movie progresses, the plot thickens. Ripley ultimately finds himself wandering around some of the most beautiful cities in Europe. These locations of paradise become the prime setting for murder.<BR>Disturbingly twisted, The Talented Mr. Ripley stuns its viewers, leading them on a windy road of pleasure and pain, beauty and sheer ugliness. The movie grabs you by the throat, turns you upside down, and then leaves you hanging, desperate for more. Over two hours of filming is not enough to satisfy, when dealing with a movie of this caliber. The first hour and ten minutes of the movie illustrates Ripleys admiration for the wealthy, stylish, all-American Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law). They grow extremely close, and the movie portrays their relationship in an especially genuine manner. The two of them, and Dickies sweetheart, Gwyneth Paltrow, seem to do everything together. Fabulous shots of good-natured fun continue through this entire portion of the movieuntil without warning, things go awry. New characters enter the equation; wonderfully contrasted scenery creates the image of deception, reminding us that appearances often conceal the dark truths; and Tom Ripleys journey from real nobody to fake somebody is enthralling, as is the entire film.<BR>Director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella does a brilliant job of perfecting each and every scene to shadow the films sinister plot. Everything about the movie is classy, especiallythe development of its characters and the actors behind them. The young, ostensibly, inexperienced actor, Matt Damon assumes the role of Tom Ripley, controversial star of the film. As soon as he steps into the shoes of the poor and pathetic Tom Ripley, it becomes obvious that Matt Damon is anything but naïve and inexperienced. He brings the eccentric character to life with such vivid realism and flare that one can only observe with profound astonishment. Easily one of the most underrated actors, Damon proves his worth in Ripley and greatly deserves all credit that he receives for the movie. He ranks among some of the best in the industry. Tackling a role that could be so hazardous to the unblemished teen-idol image he has acquired makes him all the more commendable. <BR>The entire cast of Ripley should be revered for their splendid efforts as well. Without Jude Laws awe-inspiring turn-in as Dickie, a major, irreplaceable piece of Tom would be missing. Nothing remotely negative can be said about Law or any of the other cast-members. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as always. However, lesser-known actor, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is fantastic in his role as Freddie Miles, the arrogant, snotty pal of Dickie whom Tom competes with for Dickies attention. Hoffman pinned down the precise mannerisms of his character, contributing to his overall staggering performance. To put on the finishing touches, Cate Blanchett is also entwined into the story line. Her character, Meredith Randall is the subtle cause for much of the drama that takes place. Although she appears to be insignificant, she provides for many of the movies more interesting twists. The terrific, high-quality acting of Blanchett rounds out the movie in exactly the way it is meant to, only better.<br />An exceptionally unique, masterful work of genius, The Talented Mr. Ripley, is worthy of an A+.
B00005NWM3|3.0|I found this album to be decent, however a glimmer compared to &quot;The State&quot; - 1st album. No doubt this will sell millions probably, as this band is headed in the right place, and deserve it. &quot;How you remind me&quot; reminds me of how much I wanted this album to rock, and it did a little.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty: rated R, 1 hour and 58 minutes<br /> American Beauty is Spacey at his best...again, but wait, there's more. This time, a team of actors and actresses that nearly show him up accompany Spacey. A true movie ensemble including Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley threaten to steal the spotlight. <BR> A seemingly typical suburban neighborhood gets an in-depth look beneath the shallow surface. An ordinary, financially well-to-do family is followed through the point of view of the father (extraordinary Kevin Spacey). He narrates his life and fills the audience in on all of his quirks, flaws, and limitations, as well as those of his wife (Annette Benning), and daughter (Thora Birch). These introductory moments in which Spacey reveals a side of his family that no one in the neighborhood dare discover are executed with a touch of comical ingenuity. To glance beyond this comical absurdity exposes a miserable, dysfunctional, household with no escape from their perpetual sorrows. When the movie is seen through this perspective, it loses its humor, but picks up a deeper, more real meaning. This double angle that persists throughout the movie is one of the elements that make this movie so brilliantly interesting. To reassess the movie allows the deeper, more serious meaning to become more prominent, but while watching in the moment, laughter is most likely to be the initial overwhelming response. The movie is incredibly unique in its entire concept. It is so clever, serious, and funny all in one. No other movie has risked implementing such an unlikely combination. The result is absolute, inarguable success.<BR> American Beauty deals with the true nature of life, attempting to enlighten its viewers, by doing so in a charming, eloquent manner, as opposed to shoving it down our throats. `What is beauty?' is the question that this movie raises. Is it found in a nice looking house, a good-natured person, a flower, a gorgeous woman, or is it moreabstract than that? What if beauty was found in exceptional circumstances that cannot be reasonably accounted for, or what if it were merely in understanding? All of these ideas are aroused; none are straightforwardly answered, though one theory that seems to come across clearly is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<BR> Every moment of every scene enacted in American Beauty is done with such precision and vitality, that they all become memorable without exception. The characters are all well developed. More interestingly, each character is severely flawed, some more than others, but each is forced to account for these flaws. The character of Kevin Spacey, Lester Burnham is one of great complexity, as are most in the movie. Lester has just decided that he would like to do more with his pathetic life than laze around and remain to be pathetic for eternity. He revives a suppressed, vivacious identity that he soon embraces. With this new livelihood, comes a price. His wife and daughter who have grown exceedingly distant through the years are not ready to take on a whole new Lester Burnham. <BR> To say that American Beauty exhibited superb acting throughout would be a major understatement. Kevin Spacey was utterly astonishing in his ability to convey the character of Lester Burnham. Annette Benning as Lester's wife, Carolyn Burnham was as she has never been seen before. In comparison to her flaky, overdone role in The Siege, she seemed to have undergone some sort of miraculous endowment of acting skill, as well as passion for her part. She worked beautifully with Spacey, as did the daughter, Thora Birch, and the rest of the crew. No one was really better than anyone else because each actor played his role with such grace and dignity that none can be considered second-rate. The rest of the credit is awarded to first-time feature film director Sam Mendes who envisioned the entire film. It was he who set the mood, worked on the unique camera angles, informed all ofthe actors of how there characters were to be projected, and it was he who incorporated all of the minute fine points into a giant masterpiece.<BR> No complaints can be made of the unblemished American Beauty. It deserves Oscar attention to the highest degree.
B00005LMBK|2.0|Just reviewed this CD, as most people I was mesmerized by the animated videos for these dudes. To me it seems that they spent way more time on the marketing for this band, and it shows. I was expecting the tracks to be kinda like Clint Eastwood, but in fact this album is all over the place. Reminds me a lot of Beck, however the production doesnt come close, vocals are very weak, and they leave a lot of free, ambient spots which annoys me. The rap sections were good, if you are into rap. If you are someone who likes to throw in a cd and listen from start to finish, this is for you. Overall I only liked 6 out of the 17 tracks. Track 11 &quot;19-2000&quot; is great. For me this CD was not worth the $$$. I realize I am the exception (most people liked it), and no doubt this album/band will take off, simply because of the unique angle they use.
6304795254|5.0|The Game: rated R, 1 hour and 28 minutes<br /> The incredible Douglas and Penn combo, along with the thrillingly unpredictable action sequences, are what make The Game such a great, `edge of your seat' experience.<BR> Nicholas Van Ortan (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire tycoon who resides in San Francisco. Soon it becomes obvious that Nick is not the perpetually contented man that the ideal millionaire is thought to be. He is in fact very dissatisfied and bored by life. <BR>On his birthday, he meets with one of his only remaining relatives, Conrad Van Ortan (Sean Penn), at a fancy restaurant. Conrad, Nick's brother, convinces him to spice up his life by calling the latest new corporation, known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Nick makes an appointment, in which an odd series of tests are conducted on him, taking up a total of 24 hours. <BR>CRS takes Douglas on a wild thrill ride of implausible, yet fantastic events, as the movie will for you. The Game's lack of realism does not lower its status in any way, as Nick finds himself in deserted hospitals, talking to inanimate objects, driving off piers, jumping off buildings, and much more, with the frequent, brief, and mysterious appearances of Conrad. The Game is sheer fun and excitement as well as a must-see movie for all action/adventure lovers.
B00004NRWH|5.0|This CD is the one to get, one of the best I've heard in a long time. These guys remind me a bit of Bush on this CD, however I think Nickelback has got them beat. &quot;Leader of Men&quot; is way powerful, as are the rest of the tunes, all of them rock hard. Great vocals, productions, etc.....buy it!
0553275569|5.0|I have not much to add to the other reviews, just wanting to support with five stars.<br />This book is about pilots, herostuff, the dawning of the space age and is very well researched: if you want to know about fighter pilots lives, their training, the first space modules etc, this is one to buy. And above all, it has an amazingly smart style, combining humor, facts, drama and tragedy to one big true! comedy about...the right stuff. You will laugh and learn at the same time!<br />One of the best books I have read so far.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Goonies is by far, one of the best 80's flix you will ever see.  The cast is extremely talented and fun.  The action will keep you on the edge of your seat as the Goonies try and escape the silly evil criminals, the Fatelli's.  This great dvd also includes the music video with Cyndi Lauper, which is an adventure in itself because all the Goonies appear in this great little video too.  Also if you are the fan of the robotice octopus, well you will be watching it over and over 'cause it is just one of the three missing edited scenes that you will get.  The only downside is that you can't watch the whole movie with the edited scenes, but other than that, this movie should be a part of your collection! :0)
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall has a magnificent voice. Why I thought she was going to have a problem following up, &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot;, I'll never know because she did it. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is an amazing follow up. This woman is great but she just seems to get better and better. Just listen and let her voice do the rest. She has incredible timing, wonderful musicians, and a voice that goes to that place in me that great music goes. This CD, &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, brings up emotions in me I didn't know I had. I would like to pick out one or two songs that I think are extra special but I can't because all the songs are extra special. Diana Krall is real. She isn't playing a game called jazz, she is jazz. The best kind of jazz.
B00003CXWV|2.0|Based on the book: Blow: How a Small-Town Boy Made 100 million with the Medllin Cocaine Cartel and Lost is All' by Bruce Porter, Blow is an overly familiar, overly slick, docu-drama of  real life legendary drug dealer George Jung's life. It's a second rate cable movie with Johnny Depp added to upgrade the package.  The film seems all set up to be an interesting character study, but the character is too bland to be very interesting and everything about the story is overly familiar.  The few opportunities the film sets up are squandered beneath the stylistic re-treads and multiple montages that we've seen used much more effective in films like: Scorcese's Good Fellas and Casino;  in De Palma's Scarface and in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights.<br />However, you might find enough redeeming value in the film's good performances which include worthwhile work from Ray Liotta, Johnny Depp, Cliff Curtis (who too briefly plays Escobar) and  Franka Potente (the Run Lola Run star making her American feature film debut here).  If you can somehow overlook all of the recycled ideas borrowed from the Scorcese/Tarantino/Anderson/De Palma stylistic tricks and homage to great directors of the past book... you might not find the film the pointless waste of time that I found it to be.<br />That said the DVD does have some much better than average extras, the documentary on the effects of cocaine on Colombia is very well done, the interview with currently imprisoned real life George Jung are among the highlights.<br />If the subject matter , the rise and fall of drug dealer holds any interest, the extras on the disc are definitely worth seeing.  In fact the extras are far more interesting and compelling than the film is itself.  You can watch the extras integrated into the film via the Infini-film gimmick (previously used in the 13  Weeks, and 15 minutes DVD's) or Separately accessible via the menu options.  HINT:  Make the film more interesting by making sure you turn on the Fact File feature which will give you subtitles full of interesting stuff throughout the film.<br />Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

0380002930|5.0|One of those books most people in England or the United States must have heard off in school. For me it was coincidence. As a child I once saw a cartoon called Watership Down. I remember there was music of Simon and Garfunkel in it. It probably ended with \\"Based on a story by Adams\\". Maybe that I made a mental note that day to read the book one day. I don't know. About 15 years later or so I finally bought the book and read it. Not bad, not bad at all. I thought it would be something like Duncton Wood, a book I read several years ago. And there are definitely similarities. Both books tell a story from the perspective of the animals. In Duncton Wood it were moles, here it was rabbits. I liked Watership Down better. It got me more involved and Duncton Wood was too long I think. At a certain point I got bored by it. Not Watership Down it entertained me till the end. I think the writer wrote one more book about the rabbits of Watership Down, but I'll pass on that one. Don't think a sequel was necessary. For me the story is finished.
0804115613|5.0|'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe' is one of my favorite books.  I just finished reading it again and I love it more than I did the last time!<br />There are many characters in this novel and you will love 98% of them!  This book takes place from the 30's to the 80's and is packed full of stories!<br />You will learn things about racism that you don't want to know.  I am ashamed of how some white people used to behave and how some still behave. This is a novel, but Fannie Flagg acurately depicts how cruel racism was back then and even can be NOW.<br />The most memorable characters are Idgie Threadgoode &amp; Ruth Jamison and Mrs. Ninny Threadgoode &amp; Evelyn Couch.  These women will teach you about true, real and honest friendship. Take note and you will have healthier and happier relationships.<br />Fannie Flagg is an amazing author. She has a great sense of humor and weaves a story like you wouldn't believe!  If you don't become completely engrossed in this novel I will be amazed.  I can never read it fast enough!<br />Fannie Flagg is also great at character development.  As I stated before there are many characters in this book and yet, Fannie Flagg writes in such a way that you will feel as if you know each and every one of them personally.  <br />I am always kinda sad when this book ends because I don't want to leave Whistle Stop.  I think that is why Evelyn is so sad in the end... she not only misses Mrs. Threadgoode, she misses Whistle Stop and all the people she met there through Ninny.<br />Read this book ASAP... I believe you will enjoy yourself!  Thanks Fannie!
B000000OQF|5.0|'Appetite for Destruction' is probably musically, dynamically, and emotionally, the most complete rock album of all time. Influences from ACDC, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, and even Elton John are found in the mix of hard rock anthems like 'Welcome to the Jungle' and 'Paradise City', to the unforgettable ballad of 'Sweet Child O' Mine'. 'Appetite' chronicles the fear, anger, and bittersweet emotion of the band living a precarious existance in the melting pot of Los Angeles. Slash, Duff and Izzy are at there finest on this album, with raw guitar and base lines jamming and sparring unlike on the later, over produced 'Use Your Illusion Albums'. Axl Rose sings like his life depends on it, angry, passionate and somtimes almost lost in the music. This is definitely one of the few albums you can play from start to finish, every time you play it. If you ever liked rock music, simply buy this album.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This is undoubtably one of the best albums of 2000.  From the opening track 'Arcarsenel' with the screaming of 'Beware' all the way to the excelent final track 'Catacombs' you are taken on an intense journey.  This album was prodused by Ross Robinson (Slipknot et al) and he has done a great job holding the album together.  The single 'One Armed Scissor; and the scary kidnapping song 'Enfilade' are the best on the album.  You generly cant understand what the vocalist is saying due to the Zach De La Rocha like shouting through the album but this just adds to the intnsity of the album and all the lyrics are printed in the liner notes for anyone intrested in the great writing by the band.   Buy it now anyone sick of the predictibility of nu-metal.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|I think fans are getting a LITTLE carried away here!! I like this cd...very much...but \\"5 stars\\" should mean every track is at LEAST listenable every time you play the cd! I find myself passing a few tracks when I play it...I think it's a disservice to Dylan to say that this is as good as \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", or \\"Time Out of Mind\\"...both 5 stars in my book. Let's say it's 4 stars...a very good cd...I'm glad I bought it...but it's not perfect!!
B00004TH6O|5.0|NME ranked this their number one album of 2000 and for good reasons.  The songs work both as smashthesystem and laid back.  And on a rainy day alone or at a hot summer party.  The album kicks off with Feel Good Hit Of The Summer a drug anthem with one of the best written chouruses ever ('C-C-C-C-Cocaine').  'The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret' has a puncey guiter which guides the song and makes it a brilliant pop song, how pop should be anyway.  'Better Living Through Chemistry' is the closest song remenestent of the equaly original Kyuss days.  The best song here through is 'In The Fade' featuring ex-Screaming Trees' man Mark Lanegen on lead vocals and a nice piano/keyboard chord sequence.  This is definitly one of my favorate albums of all time and would recommend, if you dont have for you to buy it right now!
6302952573|5.0|This movie brings us into the terror that William Hayes experienced in a Turkish prison in the early seventies after attempting to smuggle hash from that country.  I know after the book was published, it caused radical changes in the Turkish prison system and Turkey released many foreign nationals from incarceration.  We cannot compare the Turkey of the early 1970's to the Turkey of today, which is a modern cosmopolitan environment.<br />I think the movie wouldn't have the same affect with a lesser actor than the enormously talented, under-appreciated and late Brad Davis as William Hayes.  I found that he had a boy-like innocence, and I was compelled to feel very protective of him, despite his drug smuggling.  He has some Oscar caliber performances, in particular one where he goes into a pathological rage and bites the tongue off of another inmate.  I have never seen such monumental fury like that on film.  Another scene that gripped me was his bitter statement before the Turkish court as he is being sentenced to 30 years.    Through Brad Davis, you feel this young man&#8217;s hopes, fears, anguish, terror, and rage &#8211; the entire spectrum of emotion.  You know an actor is powerful, when it only takes the look in his eyes to affect your senses.  After this film came out, I was waiting for Davis to get bigger and better roles, why he didn't is baffling to me.  John Hurt was actually nominated for an Oscar for this film, although he was very good, his performance could not touch that of Davis.  <br />Alan Parker deserves much credit to for his direction.  The scenes in this film range from beautiful with the glorious mosques of the Ottoman Empire against the Turkish sky in the opening scene, to dark and grey as pathos sets in on our main character.  Oliver Stone has a screenplay which sets the tone.  Many of the scenes are in Turkish with no subtitles, but although we don&#8217;t know what they are saying, we really do;  that was done on purpose since the scene was meant to convey the moment.  Giorgio Moroder produced a beautiful score that reflected the wide array of emotions in this film.  <br />It is not an easy film to watch, some of the scenes are so violent and gruesome, many would turn away, but it is a harrowing story of a young man&#8217;s five year nightmare.
6302516919|4.0|This film is a story about the car, which has a spirit. It shows well Carpenter&iexcl;¯s talent. The plot is simple but interesting story telling, especially the actor who played Christine&iexcl;¯s master, his acting was superb. It makes me more interested in this film. The evil car, Christine, there is no origin about this car in this film. However, every owner of this car was dead in the car. Most interesting scene is that broken Christine restore to the original state. In addition, one man who owned this car, becoming been evil, it describes realistically. Anyway, it is worth seeing.
B000002UB3|5.0|My all-time favorite album. Everything here is perfect. Great songs, very good taste arrangements,clever chords, everybody playing damn good. &quot;Come Together&quot; is a great opener, the unforgetable bass riff, the lennonic lyrics, full of images. &quot;Something&quot; is incredibly beautiful, the guitar solo is one of my favorites ever. George Harrison did his best here, with this song and &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;, a joyful song, with beautiful vocals. Now, McCartney singing Oh!Darling is just incredible, you gotta check this out. So much power on his voice! The medley is one of the finest piece of music IMHO. Just love &quot;The End&quot;. And &quot;I Want You&quot;...it's So Heavy! Perfect album.
6305313687|3.0|If you're reading these reviews, you've already read adequately (and quite correctly) about how disturbing is the hatred and violence in American History X. I agree with the other reviewers in their emotional responses, but there are more disturbing things in this film than the Nazi fanaticism and Vinyard's eloquent defenses. It was also difficult not to notice the prominent anti-American symbolism (perhaps \\"heavy-handed\\" would be better adjective). Whenever a hateful scene is shot, the American flag is sure to appear before the camera lens. The more emotionally disturbing the hate, the more visible the flag is, larger and larger until the scene where the mother's Jewish boyfriend is thrown out and the Stars and Stripes covered two-thirds of my television screen. The Flag remains in the viewer's face until the scene where Vinyard and his brother tear down the Nazi regalia covering Danny's room. This is the last scene in which the flag appears; when the swastika is gone, so is Old Glory. Danny's room remains bare and the flag is as noticeably absent from the remainder of the film as it was pandemic in the first half. The message, while superficially against extremism, I found to be actually supportive of it. Extremists are marked by their inability to conceive of moderation. Anyone who disagrees with an extremist's ideology is sure to identified as belonging to the opposite extreme. This film seems to hold to this outlook - the alternatives for Americans today are to be either lovers of Hillary Clinton and Rodney King, or to be Nazis. Promulgated throughout the film, this outlook is especially reinforced in the final flashback. Here, disagreement with Affirmative Action and questioning what is taught at school are specifically labeled as racist and as root causes of American Nazism. The message seems to be that there is no room for fair ideological differences; there are no alternatives to our race problems but those being espoused; kill the attempt to freely discussthese problems and get behind Hillary and toe the line - or be labeled a Nazi. The plot-line is very predictable, and Edward Norton's excellent performance and some good direction are the two things standing between my opinion as is and a dismissal of American History X as crude propaganda.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I'd like to commend the team responsible for the creation of this one-disc DVD package. If it had a filming journal composed by the crew during filming (as Gladiator does) and DTS sound included (as Gladiator does), it would be the best DVD I've ever purchased. As it is, the sheer quality of this DVD is amazing.<br />   First things first: the negatives. You get Dolby 5.1 sound with this edition, but you don't get a Dolby DTS track. However, for those who must have DTS sound there is a separate edition which provides it. Also, there are no alternate language tracks that will be of use to anyone (more on that in a minute). <br />   But what this DVD does have is a great digital transfer, fantastic Dolby 5.1 sound-- and the best extras I've seen on any DVD in a long time.<br />   The Galaxy Quest DVD includes a making-of featurette, production notes, bios on the entire cast, theatrical trailers, TV spots, a novelty audio track (more on that in a minute), and an amusing Easter egg (hint: there is a reason why you must wait thirteen seconds to access the beginning menu). More importantly, you get a slew of deleted scenes that are as entertaining in themselves as some of the full feature's best moments-- a testament to the ability of this excellent ensemble cast.<br />   My personal favorite feature is the &quot;novelty audio track&quot; mentioned earlier. I'm still amazed that the producers had the guts to include it, but this movie is a comedy and including a Thermian audio track (Thermian is the odd squawking-noise language spoken by the aliens in the film), in place of something more conventional like Spanish or French, is very fitting.<br />   As for the movie-- chances are that if you know how to use your computer well enough to read this review, you've seen Galaxy Quest, but if you haven't, then you certainly should. On the one hand it's a jab at the Star Trek phenomenon; on the other hand it's a very clever movie carried to extreme effectiveness by a fantastic ensemble cast. Sigourney Weaver as a ditzy blonde, Alan Rickman with a big rubber thing on his head... and Tony Shalhoub's performance here-- it's all part of some sort of underlying genius that I can't quite put into words except to say that it's funny even when it isn't trying to be, and it's always good. This is one of the few films that I enjoy more each time I see it.<br />   Folks, this DVD is a must-own, and there aren't many of those. Get it now.
B000003N8G|5.0|This April 1969 session is the first of the Liberation Music Orchestra.Gato Barbieri,Dewey Redman,Don Cherry,Andrew Cyrille,Paul Motian are there,with Carla Bley,Sam Brown,Howard Johnson,Roswell Rudd,Mike Mantler,Perry Robinson and Bob Nothern.Three tunes were written by Carla: &quot;the introduction&quot;,&quot;the ending to the first side&quot;,&quot;the interlude&quot;;two by Charlie: &quot;circus '68 '69&quot; and &quot;song for Che&quot;,dedicated to Che Guevarra;&quot;song of the united front&quot; is a Hans Eisler's song with words by Bertold Brecht;&quot;we shall overcome&quot; has not to be presented,&quot;war orphans&quot; is by Ornette,and the three remaining tracks,&quot;el quinto regimiento&quot;,&quot;los cuatro generales&quot; and &quot;viva la quince brigada&quot; are songs from the spanish civil war.In fact,they are old spanish folk songs with lyrics added during the war.This record is as essential as the 1982 &quot;ballad of the fallen&quot; or the 1990 &quot;dream keeper&quot;.I had the opportunity of seeing the Liberation Music Orchestra during a concert in France,in the past years, and it will be one of my greatest memories in music.There is a lot of sincerity and humanity in this music, which fights,in his own way, against fascism,and racism,and all kinds of injustice.The Liberation Music Orchestra is one of free jazz's most precious children, and his music will never grow old,because its purpose is sadly always existing.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|we've heard dylan the poet, dylan the stylist, dylan the troubadour....now it's dylan the song-and-dance man. those looking for another &quot;blood on the tracks&quot; may be disappointed. this is a whole new &quot;stage&quot; for the bob-ster. it is a gorgeous album, but in a different way than &quot;time out of mind&quot; or &quot;blood on the tracks&quot;. this is the first album that seems like it's totally bob's--written and produced by him (produced under his alias &quot;jack frost&quot;). this is what true americana music sounds like. yet it probably won't get a lick of airplay anyplace. if you like his live shows with his currently incredible band, you will dig this album. warning....don't take it too seriously...it's silly in spots... just kick back and enjoy it. you won't be disappointed!!
0553573403|5.0|I never thought I'd find an author that I liked as well as Robert Jordan, I was wrong.  George R R Martin has created some characters to rival Rand, Mat &amp; Perrin.  Martin has also taken court intrigue, back-stabbing and plotting to new levels, so don't get too attached to any one character.  And to top it all off he's added dragons and the undead!  Could it get any better then that? I think not!
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall's new album is not unlike the one released before it: orchestrated arrangements of standard ballads for those who enjoy a jazzy sound without the substance of jazz itself.  For those who like Ms. Krall's rather accomplished piano playing, you will be most disappointed.  Apparently, she is rarely allowed near the keyboard these days as no doubt her producer and/or manager feel there is more money to be made with her legs and eyes rather than her musicality.  Her jazz piano exile might be diminished if she were allowed to use her voice the way she did on her earlier albums: unique timing, accentuations and phrasings utilizing her sultry voice in all its registers.  Here, however, Ms. Krall has been told to behave since we wouldn't want things to be too jazzy -- it might send the fair-weathered back to the store for a return.  Alas,like Nat King Cole before her, she has learned there is no money to be made as an artist dead set on remaining true to the principles of art. This is most unfortunate since together with other young women jazz pianists -- Junko Onishi, Myra Meldford, Geri Allen -- Ms. Krall seemed destined to bring an interesting ear and approach to the bop idiom.  Perhaps when her looks have faded she will return to jazz and begin playing her piano in deference to Monk, Powell, and Morton.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I will not extend myself about this album. I reccommend this CD to any music lover. I hope one day my small girl will enjoy it as much as I do. (well, she already dances when it's playing)
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is so awesome I love this group and every song on their CD.
B00005N5SF|3.0|Volume 34 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Trek contains two episodes which could best be described as fair-to-middling in quality.<br />Plato's Stepchildren made history of sorts by containing the first interracial kiss (inter-ETHNIC, really, since Kirk and Uhura are both of the same race--the HUMAN race) on network television.  But William Shatner, in his book Star Trek Memories, pointed out that TWO versions of the kiss were filmed--one as a full-on kiss, and one where the actors' lips didn't actually meet.  The second take was used, which means the highly touted kiss is actually a fake!  (Watch the episode and you'll see what I mean.)  Perhaps the publicity mavens connected with Trek actually are referring to the smooch between Spock and Nurse Chapel when they refer to an interracial kiss--which would fit the bill since Spock is half-Vulcan.  The rest of the episode is a mix is sillyness, some cringeworthy moments from the actors, and lightweight sermonizing.<br />Wink of an Eye is a bit better.  The idea of life-forms existing out of sync with each other has served Trek well and often.  Generally, this episode is well made, although there are inconsistencies.  It is never fully explained how the accelerated Scalosians can function on the Enterprise (the doors to the turbolift and corridors remain conveniently open for much of the episode).  Uncharacteristically, after the Scalosians have been defeated, Kirk does not extend the hand of friendship and offer them a cure for their ailment, but rather sends them on their way.  NBC's censors must have been asleep during the infamous scene where Kirk--after a coital romp with the Scalosian queen--pulls his boots back on.  There is an inventive touch late in this episode, where some stock music is played at the wrong speed to increase the disorienting effect.<br />Picture and sound are fine.
B00005NWLO|5.0|The original studio recordings are great but this is what made me a fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd. These live recordings have never sounded better(explained in the accompanying booklet) and what a package! These discs cover the three nights that Skynyrd played the Fox Theater Atlanta, Georgia. This package blows away the reissue from 1996. From the Intro to Freebird, the original release is resequenced with songs not found on the previous reissue and followed by a bonus &quot;concert&quot; made of eight additional recordings - three previously unreleased.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Episode 1 The Phantom Menace as an introduction to the Star Wars Saga successfully fulfilled its purpose.  As a movie overall the CG was amazing and the battles were mouth-dropping. But at the end of the movie you feel like something was missing.  The plot was true to Lucas' style but some of the lines were a little corny (Anakin's &quot;yipee!&quot;). This movie is a definite must have because it plays an important role in the saga.  If your looking for a masterpiece either save your money for Episodes 2 and 3 or get one of the originals.
B000005H40|5.0|If you are a jazz fan and do not have this album, there is something wrong with you.
B00000K19E|5.0|Saw this movie again last night and still get blown away with the FX. Recommend viewing the movie via commentary to get some insight into certain scenes such as the opening scene where Trinity jumps from one building to another, doing a spiral move in the process. There was a CGI enhancement to that move that you don't realize unless you listen to the commentary and then go back and review it frame-by-frame to see exactly what they are references. I'm ready for Matrix II.
B00005KHJT|5.0|I hope Anchor Bay has finally finished releasing this movie on VHS and DVD.  This is now the sixth time they have re-released HALLOWEEN and I'm tired of waisting my money by having to up-grade to the latest and greatest version.  Now having said that, Anchor Bay has done a good job in re-releasing the extended version of HALLOWEEN seperatly on its own for die hard fans of this version.  The last re-release, the 2-Disc set which featured both versions in a clam shell case, is still THE BEST available on the market.  But if you like the extended version more than the theatrical version, this DVD is for you.  The new scenes, which were shot for TV but look theatrical, blend in perfectly and make HALLOWEEN all the more better.  If you liked HALLOWEEN before, than you will like it 10x more after you see it with the new scenes.  More Loomis, more younger Michael, and more girl talk make HALLOWEEN an official masterpiece.
0316779237|5.0|Sedaris once again knocks out six stories that will knock your socks off. One story deals with a woman's notes to her freinds after her family is forced to take in a young, female Vietnamese adult (a vestige of the husband's war mistakes) who speaks a language learned from Sesame Street watchings (\\"shiny, big bird, five dollar\\"). There is nothing but hilarious bedlam for the family, accented, of course, by the Christmas Holidays. Another deals with a true story of Sedaris' sister taking a crack whore home for the Holidays. The family considers this very cool and with his family, you'l easily see why. However, the ultimate laugh is Sedaris' short-lived stint as a Santa Claus elf in New York's Macys. Born of adult men and one midget, all because they are short, Sedaris describes the outrageous tedium and shocking marching orders they have to endure. The Santa crowds with or without children are mercilessly dissected, as well they should be, as Sedaris wonderfully describes this terrible thing that is 'visiting Santa'. This book is far too short, but well worth the endorphic giggles it induces.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I have a mixture taste of music e.g my favourite band is radiohead I love Muse,Staind,Linkin Park,Coldplay,Neil Young,Levellers and loads more but I have 2 say this album rocks! my faves on the album r break stuff nookie rearranged just like this nobody like you it is such a cool abum
6301967992|1.0|I love the old hammer vampire films, so a satire on them sounded good to me, and the glowing reviews of this video suckered (no pun intended) me into buying it. Oh boy. It is a really really REALLY bad attempt by Polanski to be Mel Brooks. I love bad movies, but this one is so bad it's not even entertaining. It will bore you to tears. You can see where the jokes are meant to be, but they are so resolutely NOT FUNNY, you will begin to wonder if Polanski is trying to employ some sort of meta-humor never before seen on planet earth. The only explanations I have for Maltin's positive review is either that a)he is an alien, or b)he has not seen the movie, but seeing Polanski's name attached to it, decided it must be good. That seems most likely. Fearless Vampire Killers is not good. It is terrible. If you don't believe, me, rent it and see. You'll thank me for not encouraging you to buy it when you experience for yourselves how godawfully boring, humourless and inept it really is. There's more laughs in the camp factor of the original vamp films this one purports to parody.
B0000004V2|5.0|Having already been a big fan of Blur and Suede, I was interested to hear this album, especially considering the cult following that seems to follow this album everywhere.  So I went out and bought it.  At first I was not impressed.  But then I let the album grow on me and I realized that one song after another was simply classic.  It wound up as being, in my opinion, the greatest album ever, better than &quot;Revolver&quot; or &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;.  Even if it lacks the diversity of the first or the great musicianship of the second, they compensate simply by having a better batch of songs.  Also, Reni and Mani were a great rhythym section, implying dance but not going overtly into it.  John Squire's licks were great, and Ian Brown's nonchalance fit the mood perfectly.<br />The highlights are the first five songs (the fifth one, &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, is merely &quot;Waterfall backwards, but still great).  Also, &quot;Made of Stone&quot; featured unusually profound lyrics, and the two closers &quot;I am the Resurrection&quot; and &quot;Fool's Gold&quot; are psychedelic epics, each clocking in at over 8 minutes but never sounding too long.<br />While it's truly a shame that they couldn't capitalize on this album, they left behind 13 great songs for the world to enjoy.  And even though they didn't break the US like they deserved to, those who have the album know what everyone else is missing.<br />Buy this album.
0783226063|5.0|This movie version of Frank Herbert's story shines for its opulent settings, very evocative of a time 8100 years in our future (maybe?).  It is flawed by deviating slightly from the storyline.  As in other versions, the impossibility of convincingly representing certain aspects which are better imagined by the readers themselves makes a movie inferior to a book (e.g. ornithopters, eyes of the ibad).  But the water discipline of the planet is much better-represented here than in the TV movie, and the actors were well-cast and represent rich characters.  Virginia Madsen makes a very good rle of the Princess Irulan, appearing at the introduction although she plays only a minor character in the story.  I think Jrgen Prochnow is - at times - a little stiff as Duke Atreides.  But it was a very detailed story to present in movie format and this version did an excellent job.
B000002UA0|5.0|Syd Barrett still remains one of rock's true enigmas. He led the early Floyd through psychedelic rave ups and into the spotlight, but only to burn out and hide away. On this, the Floyd's first full length record, he takes you to another dimension. From the mindblowing instrumental passages of &quot;Intersteller Overdrive&quot; and &quot;Astronomy Dominee&quot; to the fairly tale fun of &quot;Lucifer Sam,&quot; &quot;The Gnome,&quot; and &quot;Matilda Mother&quot; he really creates a fun, mind expanding atmosphere that seems to be one of a kind. Barrett's range as an entertainer seemed endless: on one side an incredible, experimental instrumentalist on the guitar and he could also write fun, fairy tale stories that were pop gems (see &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot; on Relics). This album is one of a kind in the Floyd library because sadly it really is their only album with Syd. Any fan of the 60s experimental scene or Pink Floyd will cherish this one with the rest of their Floyd collection because, well, it is different.  Mind-blowing great different.
B00005NZBN|3.0|Mellower than his recent live shows, Bob delivers the goods again here with an ultra-rootsy feel. Real, real nice. However, I am ready for a live record taken from the last 3-5 years with this incredible band.
0553528521|5.0|'Ya just gotta love this book.<br />Bourdain truly has a way with words.  Many books in this genre fall into simply recounting event after event in a chef's experience.  This one does this a little, of course, [otherwise, there's no book], but Mr. Bourdain [Flaco, for the initiated] does so with flair and color.<br />Bourdain is all New York, and it shows in his prose.  But I like that [but warning to the faint of heart--get ready for some rough language!].  I listened to this audio tape in my car, and there were several times I had to bang on the dashboard I was laughing so hard.  And mostly, it's because of Mr. Bourdain's word choice.  He can really tell a colorful story.  And he has great insight into people [and he's sure met some interesting ones], and you can tell that.<br />Hey, I'm a student of management, and believe it or not, parts of this book wax into this area.  Flaco, maybe your next book ought to be &quot;A Chef's Guide to Management,&quot; or something like that.  Clearly, if you can survive in any management capacity in the New York restaurant scene, you can survive anywhere!<br />I learned a lot about the whole restaurant industry from this tape.  Oh, anyone contemplating entering the food service industry should read, or listen to, this book.  [By the way, I recommend the audio version, as you get the benefit of Bourdain reading to you, which further spices up an already spicy account of chefdom!]<br />Final piece of advice.  Hey, get this book to a Hollywood producer!  It'd be a great comedy.  There's all kinds of insight into people too.<br />Great read [listen].
B000001EXB|2.0|There are a couple of good songs here, but the rest of the record is tough to get through.  I am a big time elton fan (50+ shows), and most ej nuts like myself agree this one was not up to par, nor was the tour that accompanied it.  Best record of the '90's was Made in England, some of those songs rate with anything he's ever done, and the concerts that year were epic. Pick that one up.<br />Fingers are crossed on the new record that is due in Oct.  EJ does not have the energy anymore but hopefully he still has the touch.
0679721037|5.0|\\"Hiroshima\\" is about the people who experienced the destructive powers of the atomic bomb firsthand. It does not tell you whether the bomb was a necessary evil, or whether the US should have found alternative methods of victory. It only attempts to describe the lives of six people who were in Hiroshima that day, what they saw and what they did. In this book, the ethics of the bomb are not the issue, though it can be argued that it is anti-bomb or anti-war because it doesn't put the war in context. But given the scope of the book, the context isn't necessary. The bomb had consequences; to deny that is to put patriotism over humanity.<br />There are some quirky reviewers here who mention that this is a \\"novel.\\" \\"Hiroshima\\" is not a work of fiction. John Hersey interviewed several people who were in Hiroshima at the time of the atomic bomb and survived, and this is the story of six of them. He originally meant to publish the contents serially in the New Yorker, hence the four chapters (A Noiseless Flash, The Fire, Details are Being Investigated, and Panic Grass and Feverfew) that are separated chronologically, each discussing all six people in that particular time frame. This is probably why the form of the book was confusing for some people who didn't like going from one person's story to another, and back again (though I personally found it easy to follow). Eventually it was decided that the four chapters should be published as one article, taking up most of the August 31, 1946 New Yorker magazine. The aftermath was written forty hears later and comprises almost half the book. It is a follow up on the people and is just as relevant-the bomb would have its effects long after most people began to forget.<br />If you want to know about the bomb and how it relates to World War II, then there are many other sources out there. But &quot;Hiroshima's&quot; value lies in its portrayal of the sheer horror of the power of atomic weapons. The discussion of whether the existenceand use of weapons of mass destruction can be justified might be eternally debated. But that debate must include the consequences of what can happen to human beings and the conditions in which they live. I first read this book in sixth grade, and the words \\"He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glovelike pieces\\" has never left my mind.
B000000OAN|5.0|Whenever I pull this album out of my cd jolder, I always seem to go &quot;Ok, let's see if this album is still any good.&quot; And I always seem to be amazed by the album! This is one of the few albums I have where every song impresses me. Nothing has done that to me since Blizzard of Ozz. Brian May's guitarwork shines on this album, espiecially on 39 and Death On Two Legs. You've got everything on this album, heavy rockers like Death on Two Legs, Sweet Lady, and I'm in Love With my Car, Nice humorous songs like Gazing On A Sunday Afternoon, and Seaside Rendevous(How on earth do the do those harmonies?), and you've got big epics like Bohemian Rhapsody. Big song. However, the best song from Queen has to be The Prophet's Song. God, that is amazing. 8 minutes of melodic prog rock. It also has the great echoing harmonies. This album is perfect.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Duran Duran were always derided as being more about image than substance, but if you really dig &quot;pop&quot; music, it doesn't get much better than this. These guys played all their own instruments and wrote all their own songs. They didn't need a big group of European producers in a studio somewhere in Sweden to write and produce all their stuff for them. Anyway, if you don't own anything by them, this is the perfect place to start. It has all of their big hits on it, and the sound is AMAZING. Sure they were pop, but I knew them as a &quot;New Romantic&quot; band when they first started...and this is some creative stuff. Now if Capitol would release a companion DVD, then my collection would be complete...
B00004STUL|5.0|Will Smith and Martin Lawrance star as cops teamed up.<BR>Almost Would Look Like The Show &quot;Cops&quot; With The Theme<BR>Song. A Cool Movie on Video and DVD. The DVD is the best with all of the features you will need inculding a music video the original trailer and more.
B00000K19E|4.0|I saw The Matrix and let me tell you it was a very good movie. A very good movie but not amazing. I loved this movie but I dont understant the people who bill it as the greatest movie ever. The movie has a very good, yet very complex plot that at times is hard to follow. Great action scenes and extreordinary acting make it a four star movie. The movie is about a young hacker who is told that the world he is living in is fake, created by machines. He is thrust into the real world and fightes for the humans. I highly reccomend it but please dont make such a big deal.

630512762X|5.0|FACE/OFF was one of the best movies I have seen. John Woo wows me again in a movie with explosive action, great acting and an incredible plot. FBI Agent Sean Archer (Travolta) undergoes surgery to look exactly like Castor Troy (Cage). What he doesnt expect is that Troy waked up from surgery and forces doctors to make him look like Archer. After that all hell breaks loose. Great movie with tons of action and excellent acting, this one will not bore nor dissapoint. SEE IT!

B00005JKPF|5.0|I only hope there is character development in this film.It's not like there was anything wrong about the first one but,I think they left a lot of questions unanswered,for example,Wolverine's Flashback when he was in a lab or something and they were experimenting with him,making him a mutant of course.I also think Rogue's character could'd been a lot better,I mean,she's one of the hotties from the X-men World.The other characters were great.I just want to see more character development and a good story,forget about sound effects and all this stuff,a good story is all we need to consider a movie an unforgetable one.
B00005LIN0|1.0|The most dissappointing opera (film) I have ever seen. After waiting for so long for a proper version of this cornerstone of american music, to see the performers lip sync their way through a performance even though on tape, BARBARIC!! The sound quality was horrible as well. Do justice to the only true american opera and bring the cameras to New York City Opera, and see what Porgy and Bess should really sound. If I could get my money back on this shamefull production I would at the drop of a hat.
6305807043|3.0|I'm glad I saw the film before reading the reviews published here because part of the enjoyment of the film is not knowing what is going to happen next.  The plot is unique and the acting is good.<BR>One of the problems I had with the film was with the superfluous obscenities,  lewd comments and homophobic remarks.  It is not the obscene nature of the comments that was off-putting, but rather their inappropriateness given the context they were in.  I guess I just  don't find that sort of thing inherently amusing.<BR>The other bothersome aspect of the play was the inconsistent characterizations.  Dr. Lester's character, for instance, changes drastically from the beginning of the movie to the end.  We are not talking about character development as a result of life experiences or epiphany, either.<BR>Overall it was a film worth watching, however.  It certainly took a different perspective and a creative mind to think up this plot.

B00003CWL6|3.0|When first viewed in theatre, I was favorably impressed with this film, not the least of which because of the Oscar-deserving Kevin Spacey. Upon repeat viewings at home, I have to say that it does not hold up. The performances are fine, with the exception of an over-the-top Annette Benning, but the high-handed and the pretentious (the swirling paper in slow motion) treatment by director/writer Mendes of the theme - the illusion that is the American dream - eventually gets under one's skin. The subject matter is a worthy one, I just wish that it had been done with more originality and panache...
0425179877|1.0|I fully understand that Gene Kranz is not a writer, but at the same time, Mr. Kranz should also come to grips with that same fact. This book had the potential to be so much more than the equivalent of a seventh grade account of a summer holiday. If Mr. Kranz would have availed himself of the services of a professional writer or editor this book could of really been a completely different experience. There was only the slightest attempt to translate the technology of the time into terms that can be understood today. <br />After reading this book, the NASA space program of the 1960's and 1970's has all the cachet of a Thursday afternoon at the local Post Office.
0553106635|4.0|The _A Song of Fire and Ice_ Series is great.  It's a compelling story with everything an epic fantasy fan could want.  That said, this is the third book, and it's a very complex world with a lot of plot threads and characters.<br />If you've read _A Game of Thrones_ and _A Clash of Kings_, you don't need me to tell you to buy this book -- it's been out enough, you've either already bought it or are waiting for the paperback.<br />If you haven't read any of the series, you do NOT want to start in the middle.  You may or may not get lost -- GRR Martin is a good enough writer that you may not -- but there's a lot of backstory to pick up.<br />Equally importantly, a lot of the impact of the first two books will be lost.  GRR Martin is a master of the surprise twist.
B00005N9CV|1.0|I'm sure I am in the minority in my opinions of this CD, but-this new album represents a giant step for Ms. Krall away from her jazz roots and, sadly, toward \\"popular\\" even \\"elevator\\" music. Even though Dianna has had great commercial success with her newer CDs, I still feel Dianna's best recorded work was done on her CD \\"All for You\\" a tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio recorded a few years ago. I own all her CDs and have seen her perform live thus I do have some perspective on her body of work.  This new album is far too bland, quiet and boring. As some other reviewers have noted-after a while, probably due to the slow tempo and heavy orchestration, the songs start sounding the alike!  (...)
B00003CXTG|3.0|For those demanding great drama, forget about it. It's an OK, shlocky love story; it was enough to hold my interest, but frankly, too long leading up the the payoff.<br />That said, the battle scenes were excellent. Historically accurate? Dunno. But they're fast paced eye-candy, and if that appeals to you, I'd highly recommend them.
B000051ZST|4.0|I didn't expect much here and caught it on HBO. I found the humor funny and not just aimed at the teen audience. Matter of fact some of the humor seemed dry and rather creative along with a few side splitters. There is plenty for the younger crowd, but this did not seem to me as one of those formula teen skin flicks. There is some skin but it is not too gratuitus and adds to the story. I think I'd even watch it again. For thirtysomethings there is some to take you back and some really good laughs backed up by some suprisingly good acting.
B00003CXBK|4.0|The movie itself can be summed up in one word...breathtaking.<br />The story is incredible.  It deals with concepts that we are related to everything on this planet, that everything has a spirit, and the ramifications of our actions.  The story does not define one person as \\"the villain\\" of the movie.  Though some characters are darker than others, there is no ruthless, cold-hearted villain that we have come to associate with movies.  That single fact leads the movie to be a bit more impact than it would if it had one truly evil person defined as the bad guy.<br />The animation is done well.  The characters look rather realistic and that lends to the fact that these are supposed to be actual people instead of the cold cut hero and villain.<br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks sound excellent, you really get a sense of being there if you have the sound system.  The voices are never covered up by the action and the fight scenes are something that you just have to see and hear to comprehend what I'm saying.<br />The reason I give this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is nothing against the movie.  My only real complaint about this DVD is that it is begging for a full on, special edition DVD and what we get is an extremely short featurette and the trailer.  The featurette does not go into any depth about the movie itself, it really only deals with the way the actors that created the English dub responded to the film.  The trailer is just the standard trailer that you have probably seen before some other movie, if at all.<br />All in all, this is an extremely good movie, with a rather bleak DVD.  I don't regret buying this on DVD; I only hope that they will come out with a Collector's or a Special Edition that truly does this movie justice on the DVD format.
B00005AXEL|3.0|I am a really big Stevie Nicks fan but this CD just didnt do it for me.  The only two songs that I really love are &quot;I MISS YOU&quot; and &quot;LOVE IS&quot; they are great! The other songs just seemed to &quot;miss&quot; something of Stevie...didnt seem to be her style.
B00003CXN4|5.0|This is the director's movie all the way, with no single character<br />  being the chief protagonist, and three stories running in parallel.<br />  Steven Soderbergh does a great job of it, and in my opinion fully<br />  deserved the Oscar he got.<br />  This was definitely one of the best movies of 2000, and not<br />  surprisingly, bagged several nominations and 4 Oscars.<br />  The 'traffic' is that of drugs, more specifically the drugs mafia<br />  in Mexico &amp; America. The movie approaches the problem from several<br />  angles : the cartel in Mexico, their 'gang wars' and the efforts<br />  of the law to curb them; the 'respectable' among the high society<br />  in the US who act as channels for the cartel, the kids in the US<br />  who turn to drugs as a result of alienation, and American<br />  law-enforcers waging a frustrating battle against the drug cartel.<br />  Benicio Del Toro plays a brave Mexican cop, who's very well informed<br />  and wages his own little war against the cartel. He has the biggest<br />  role and does full justice to it in an excellent performance, which<br />  fetched him the Oscar for best supporting actor.<br />  Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are expectedly competent,<br />  but not really remarkable.<br /> Michael Douglas is a 'drug czar', ie he heads the American effort to<br />  clamp down on the 'traffic' at the highest level. Ironically, his<br />  own daughter is an addict,  which brings home the fact that it is an<br />  extremely difficult and frustrating battle he's fighting.<br />  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a rich housewife, whose world suddenly<br />  colapses one day, when the cops come and take her husband away.<br />  Her grief is compunded by the horror of discovering that he actually<br />  deals in drugs. However, she then takes a u-turn and takes over the<br />  business while her husband is under trial, arranging for the murder<br />  of the key witness against him.<br />  Dennis Quaid is wasted in a pretty small role.<br />  The support cast is good, especially Cheadle &amp; Guzman, who play the<br />  wiretap specialists investigating the drugs scam in San Diego, the<br />  guy who plays Del Toro's friend and the one who plays the Mexican<br />  general invloved in a diabolical game.<br />  The movie doesn't have an 'ending', in the sense it doesn't resolve<br />  all the issues, but i don't mind thinking for myself :-)<br />  So why does this movie get such mixed reviews ? Well, for one, the<br />  different 'shooting styles'(colors, angles etc) used for different<br />  places may not appeal to everyone - Mexico is yellowish, Ohio is<br />  blue, and San Diego is colourful &amp; glossy. Secondly, the editing<br />  is swift, and very good in my opinion, but may seem abrupt to<br />  some. Then there is the so-called 'documentary style' employed by<br />  Soderbergh, who does the camerawork as well.And of course, many<br />  people like their movies to have 'proper endings'....<br />  So if you want a 'feel-good'/glossy movie, this isn't for you.<br />  However, if you want a well-directed movie with solid performances,<br />  which tackles a story from various angles and leaves it to you to<br />  draw your own conclusions, 'Traffic' should be worth your while.t cast is good, especially Cheadle &amp; Guzman, who play the<BR>  wiretap specialists investigating the drugs scam in San Diego, the<BR>  guy who plays Del Toro's friend and the one who plays the Mexican<BR>  general invloved in a diabolical game.<br />  The movie doesn't have an 'ending', in the sense it doesn't resolve<BR>  all the issues, but i don't mind thinking for myself :-)       <br />              So why does this movie get such mixed reviews ?

6305971099|5.0|This is a very good DVD. It has a very good picture and Anchor Bay knows how to make old films look like new. Note: I am rating the DVD 5 stars. The film would get 4 1/2 stars. Anyway, the movie was good and I enjoyed it. I liked it because it was scary and sometimes funny. Michael Myers mask looks the worst in this one, but its still frightning. The documentary was very good and the interviews were interesting. If you liked Halloween, Halloween 2,and Halloween 4, give this entry a shot.
6305177473|4.0|This movie is fun and funny! I like the part where Hallie and her 2 buddies at Camp start a war with Amy and HER 2 buddies! It's funny where the Hallie group starts messing up Amy's cabin: Strings allll over the place, Sticky floor with glue and tar, a bucket full of sticky syrup which would fall on you if you open the door, and lots of yucky stuff! It's really funny!<br />I rated this 4 stars because you'll kind of get tired after watching it alot.That's my opinion. Other people wouldn't think so, maybe. Butyou should buy this one! It's a fantastic movie!
B00005A1PR|5.0|Bought the album and loved it - and then went and saw her open for Sade (also excellent) - she blew me away.  Very personable and real... entertaining, as well as having a terrific voice. Plus, found out she is from Denver and she had her mom come and sing with her onstage, which was a real treat!
B00005NIE1|4.0|This album rocks. It is brimming with cool songs that rock your a## all the way down to the basement. Whatever that means. Its very accesible without being pandering and silly. Everyone in your family will love it. Grandma Jill. Uncle Steve. Everyone. It would have gotten 5 stars but its not stanky enough. But I guess that is why everyone in your family will like it. Oh well. Just buy it. Its filled with classic tracks. Unfortunately 'New York City Cops' has been removed from the album. It was an awesome song. It's fine. Tracks 4-6 are one of those rare trifectas of bootyliciousness. The rest is good too. Go for it!
B0000019PA|5.0|Perhaps the greatest record of all time. The most hauntingly beautiful, and eerie thing you will ever listen to. <br />The only record where the lyrics, and recording are as much as a musical instrument as the guitar Jeff Magnum strums on. Listen to the overmodulation of his voice on &quot;Two Headed Boy&quot; and tell me that the distortion it's making doesn't sound like the tape just can't hold enough power to capture the beauty of the song.<br />Shame to all of you for thinking the Diary of Ann Frank is a clichéd source of inspiration. Perhaps we should turn our backs on all books that have sold more than 1 million copies because the writer has sold out huh?<br />As good as music can get.
0380729407|1.0|This book was a waste of my time. He uses to many pages describing... NOTHING. I guess he tried to make it creepy by the whole evil carnival but... it didnt work. I had to do this book for a book report so I had to read it. Halfway through the book it seems as if you are just beginning it waiting for the story to really begin. I reccomend for you to NOT read this book. The only thing that drew my attention was the cover.
B00003CXX8|5.0|I thought THE GLASS HOUSE was first-class suspense, as far as teen flicks go. A lot of people like to critize films like these. So what if the trailers gave away too much of the film? That shouldn't give you any reason to hate it or not to go see it...you can't judge a film by it's trailer! Besides, it's mainly for entertainment and enjoyment, period. That's what Hollywood is for, right? THE GLASS HOUSE is about a teenage girl named Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) who lives with her brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), and their parents in LA. When Ruby comes home one night to find out her parents died in a car accident, she and her brother are sent to live with the Glasses', their parents' best friends who live in Maliabu. They move into the Glasses' strange creepy mansion which is made out of glass. Soon, Ruby starts to notice that the guardians aren't what they seem to be...and things start getting even stranger when the Glasses' want Ruby and her brother dead!<br />I thought THE GLASS HOUSE was an excellent film. I definitely want to go see this a second time and I'm planning on buying it when it comes out on DVD. All the actors are truly amazing and talented, especially Diane Lane (who is excellent in all her films), Leelee Sobieski, and Trevor Morgan. The special effects were pretty fantastic, and the whole film was just creepy and full of suspense! It kept me glued to the edge of my seat the entire time - I never once took my eyes off the screen! There are also some surprising twists that pop up in the film that were not given away in the trailer or previews. I'm not going to be the one to give any of them away so all I can say is please go see this film! It's totally worth your money and it's definitely one of the best films of the fall. Go see THE GLASS HOUSE and you won't be disappointed! :-)
0452282152|4.0|It took a year for me to buy this book, and I wish someone had told me to spend the time and money earlier. Chevalier maintains a voice throughout Girl with a Pearl Earring that builds a character, a time, and a life that is both that of a young poor maid in 17th century Holland and of her broader culture. It takes you into a world full of tensions as timeless as men and women, rich and poor, upstairs and downstairs, but without the violence, language and graphic sex expected in today's world. And all are driven by the unerring voice of Griet.
6301697707|4.0|The race to higher ground is on when two handymen and a local seismology student discover that their little town of Perfection, Nevada is infested with stinky subterranean man-eating worms. <br />This is definetly one of my favourite horror films of all time. The character developement and location is very original. Usually every movie that has something to do with monsters has a good explanation of their existence. That is why TREMORS is such a great movie. It leaves their existence a mystery. People think all of a sudden they started terrorizing them, but they've been there for many years. <br />What worked for me in this film was the suspense. I'm always looking for suspense other than just senseless violence. Finally there's a movie like this one that does just that. <br />The film's plot also stays together throughout the movie. It doesn't change badly. It simply stays at one detail at a time and keeps you in suspense. That is why this is such a well-made movie. <br />I'd have to give it to the effects crew though. That was pure genious of them. The Graboids looked very real. As if they were actual creatures living on our planet. The most awesome scene they put together was the Graboids under the ground. Seeing them slide through that dirt was really creepy looking. It was like a twisted dream. <br />TREMORS proves how suspenseful, humorous and terrifying horror movies can go. Just watch and see! <br />I hope my review was helpful to you!
B00003CXX8|2.0|I expected The Glass House to deliver a suspenseful clever twisting and turning of events amidist creepy adoptive parents.  Well...the creepy parents was the only thing we got.  LeeLee Sobieski is as stiff as an ironing board, most of the time seeming too embarrassed about taking the role to function properly.  The plot seemed great, but the story's twists and turns could have been thought of by a 3rd grade classroom...and they frankly make our heroine look as dumb as a brick.  How did this girl not figure out that the lawyer was giving up information to the adoptive family?  Hello...earth to Leelee.  Some of it was meant to be exploitative...like her swimming in the pool in a ridiculous bikini...or the secretary at the office.  No matter, the ending was an anti-climax.  But it was all pretty bad.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I am on a badly needed news fast, so I rented some films having nothing whatsoever to do with our present unfolding horrors. If you have never been to rural France, the village and countryside will give you a very good idea of what some of it still looks like. The tale is delightful. For my fundamentalist friends and relatives, let me note that the first recorded miracle of Christ in the Gospels was turning water into really first-class wine to keep a good party going. The most Christ-like figure in the film is not the petty hypocrite of a mayor, but the mysterious chocolate shop owner who heals people of their fear, hatred, and bigotry. I will buy a copy soon. It gives you hope.
0452282152|4.0|One of my dearest friends gave me this book to read with the assurance that I'd enjoy it and that it was &quot;an easy read.&quot; I did and it was. I was quickly pulled into a historical period of which I know next to nothing -- 17th century Holland. Chevalier's descriptions are richly detailed, her characters seem real and engaging. The book pulled me in and kept me there. Story-wise the ending was somewhat unsatisfying but quite realistic.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Someone once said that Diana Krall's voice is like &quot;smooth honey.&quot; That phrase describes it perfectly. Diana Krall has grown artistically since her very first album. She has always been incredible, but now she is even better...she is flawless. Krall's music is elegant, sexy, heartbreaking, romantic, and tender. Her new &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is truly wonderful and timeless. It exudes love which makes this the perfect album for anyone &quot;in love with love.&quot; I am so proud to own this collection of fabulous songs. Krall is accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra which transforms her into a mega-jazz singer and not just a torch singer like in her past albums. I must admit that I do miss her piano playing genius, but the marvelous orchestra that surroundes her voice replace any feelings of sentiment. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; arrived at my house just as I needed some comfort due to the tragedy in our country. Diana Krall lifted my heavy heart and made me see love once again. And in this world, we need to be surrounded by love and all of the aesthetics that come with it. This is the album that you have been waiting for, and you will be listening to it for years to come.
B000002MZ9|3.0|The cd is pretty decent but not as musically inspiring as I thought it would be.I think the music is a little to overshadowed by too many distorted guitars and fuzzy playing. I was hoping for more technical interplay between Mccready, gossard and Neil.The single I got ID with neil young was a better example of what could be between the group.All in All, its a pretty good cd but I think it could have been much better if they broke out some accoustical stuff along with all the overdose of grunge.
B000002HMH|3.0|I support Metallica's decision to go in different directions and I don't think they're a sellout by any means, but here is the point in time, like GNR a couple years earlier with UYI, decided to make 2 albums. One right after another. The dissapointing thing is that they have enough classic songs on these two CD's to have made a classic like Lightning, Puppets, Justice, or Black Album. This album shows a decline that had begun with the Black Album. The first 10 songs were classic, but My Friend Of Misery and Struggle Within were good, but unnecessary. On Load And Reload they have 7 classic songs in a sea of mediocroty like Wasting My Hate, Cure, Devils Dance etc.... Get My Drift. They have become so mediocre that filler material Better Than You won a Grammy. A lot of bands have filler, but Metallica, like Pink Floyd when they were good, never was one of them. That's what makes this dissapointing. While Fuel and Memory Remains are good songs, they're not Metallica. Their more Stone Temple Pilots , who I like by the way. If we lived in a perfect world they would have made this CD.<br />1. King Nothing-Heavy, but with a damn catchy chorus, would be a classic opening song like \\" Blackened \\" or \\" Enter Sandman \\"<BR>2. The Outlaw Torn-classic title track as this album should have been named \\" The Outlaw Torn \\" instead of Load. A Total Masterpiece<BR>3. The House That Jack Built-a classic, but would be bridge to something one step better like \\" The Thing That Should Not Be \\" to \\" Sanitarium \\" on Master Of Puppets<BR>4. The Unforgiven II-the best sequel to a legendary song that <BR>Metallica could have made, unlike Megadeth's pathetic \\" Return To Hangar \\", would be the ballad-like track that Track 4 was on older albums<BR>5. Bleeding Me-one of the most emotional songs I have ever heard<BR>6. Ronnie-dark song that foreshadowed the school shootings, but with a catchy chorus<BR>7. Until It Sleeps-good pop song, but would be filler on this great album<BR>8. Hero Of The Day-sameas above<BR>9. Where The Wild Things Are-will get stuck in your head for days, I think this is the sequel to \\" Enter Sandman \\"<BR>10. Fixxxer-a total .... masterpiece. Best Song on both of the Load's. An epic in the vein of \\" Creeping Death \\" or \\" Disposable Heroes \\"<br />If they made this, they would have been more legendary than they already were.

B00003CXSM|5.0|My roommate and I are currently going through a sappy romance phase. We pulled this off the shelf at the video store, and wanted to watch 3 times in a row! This movie excels at exactly what it is... a light-hearted romantic comedy. The characters are likable and realitically portrayed. Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey have great chemistry (and he is going down in our book of absolutely adorable men!). I believe the pacing of this film was good, coming at a predictable plot from a unique perspective with several interesting new characters. Rent this movie if you are a romantic or if you just want a sweet film that will make you laugh. If you need something deeper, maybe this film isn't for you. But after you depressed yourself with that (and I say this with the utmost good humor), THEN rent this film.
6305171769|5.0|It's been twenty years since that terrible Halloween night but yet Laurie Strode can't forget it.  It's embedded deep her mind and she can't seem to let it go despite all the changes in her life since then.  Laurie faked her death and changed her name to Keri Tate.  She's now the headmistress of a school in Summers Glen, California.  She has a son as well.  Everything seems to be going fine even though she can't let go of her terrible past. <br />Soon, things go downhill fast.  Michael Myers isn't dead.  He's still very much alive, and he wants his revenge against Laurie.  He'll stop at nothing to get what he wants.  Halloween H2O is filled with terror and suspense.  The acting is very well done.  Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode/Keri Tate.  Now Laurie must face Michael one final time.  Who will survive?  Laurie or Michael?  This is, without a doubt, the best Halloween sequel in the series.

B00004VVNB|5.0|You know, I didn't really like this movie when it first appeared in theaters.  I thought Michael York had cheekbones as wide as a football field, and Jenny Agutter was as frigid as one of BOX's tv-dinner sanctuary seekers.  I guess I've mellowed with age.  This DVD is a wonderful version of what has turned out to be a classic of the genre.  Widescreen post-apocalyptic pie-in-the-sky glory.  Carousel, last day, cats, Box, muscle, the New You, the Love Shop, sandmen, sanctuary..all words of the day, and fresh and new in this DVD.  If you have never had the pleasure of seeing this movie, I highly recommend it.  I love the Dallas and Ft. Worth locations.  I have stood in that fountain that was used for the final scenes of the film.  It's across from the Ramada Inn in Ft. Worth Texas.  <br />Seriously, Peter Ustinov as Old Man is the crowning gem of the movie.. his &quot;Oh MY!&quot; at every suprise, his quotes from &quot;Book of Practical Cats&quot; is pure joy. <br />This is a great version of the movie.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|Hilarious!!!! I saw this film before I saw either of the evil dead movies and it does fine on it's own (it did get me to rent the other two though). Don't go looking to get scared here. This movie is not a horror film but, rather, a sarcastic spin on all those bloated, bigger than life, action hero movies (which I usually like as well) in a horror film wrapper. My favorite line.... &quot;Lady I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.&quot; How many films could make losing your hand funny?
B00005K3O4|5.0|Killer Klowns from Outer Space is a zany, fun ride through cinematic B-movie world. It is the prime example of a B-movie. There's bad acting or over-acting, crazy plot details, and wacky characters. The plot is simple. Aliens in the form of clowns begin to take over a town. It's up to a police officer and a group of teens to stop them. Grant Cramer and Suzanne Snyder are great as our hero and heroine. Personally, I like Suzanne Snyder. Even though I've only seen her in 2 horror movies, both B-movie material, there's just something about her. John Nelson is our co-hero. <br /> A lot of the movie was set and costume-based, as you can see in the movie. The klowns are something to look at. The normal horrible clown face (I have a clown fear) is twisted and gnarled into an even uglier clown face on these guys. Their actions and what they do just creeped me out. <br /> The DVD is any KKFOS fan's dream. There's plenty of supplemental material. The featurettes feature interviews with the film's creators, the Chiodo Brothers. They also contain some behind the scenes shots, and the last featurette contains films made by the three in their early days. The featurettes do drag some, but are fun to watch. Also included are two deleted scenes. One that features our three main people walking on a &quot;tight-rope&quot;, and the other is Suzanne's character explaining why she has a fear of clowns. I actually liked that scene, but I believe both can sometimes be seen in the TV versions. Also included are a number of photo and still galleries, and the original theatrical trailer. There's also a commentary with the Chiodo Bros. The picture is the clearest I've ever seen this movie. The audio is pretty good, but there is a moment in the film where the dubbing is off for about 5 minutes. The main menu is very animated with sounds and theme music, while others are static backgrounds. <br /> The Killer Klowns from Outer Space DVD is certainly a must buy for fans of the movie and those of B-movies.
B00005N9CV|2.0|As an early and enthusiastic supporter of Diana Krall, I had hoped that the look and the voice could remain second fiddle to her sharp and pointed piano style. If only she could remain strong instrumentally, she wouldn't be mainstreamed into oblivion. Krall's excellent singing voice and blond good looks have been her downfall though, and no matter how much more comfortable she protests to being on piano, Verve (the shame of it!) has other plans. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is a drone of orchestra and sultry songs, with Krall still trying to sing jazz, leaving legato sections unexpectedly clipped on occasion. This is typifyed on &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well&quot;, where holding the last note in the main phrase is critical. Krall sounds like she has just run in from a long jog to get this one done. Get Carly Simon's &quot;Torch&quot; if you want this sort of evening, and &quot;All for You&quot; to hear how Krall sounds at her best. Coupled with the shameless photo layout which exploits Krall's &quot;look&quot;, this one is well over the top. Gone are all the fun songs, all the jazz, and almost all of the piano. As with Armstrong, Cole and so many others, Krall is heading down the path to bankable medocrity. I'll miss her terribly.

B000002A3T|5.0|So it doesn't have Roger Waters. So what?! I respect him, but he's not the only reason for a good PF album. He was left alone to do &quot;The Final Cut&quot; and the end result was one of the weaker PF releases. That's not the case with &quot;TDB&quot;. This is surely one of the best albums to come out of PF, with or without Waters. No doubt, one of the best five Pink Floyd albums.<br />&quot;The Division Bell&quot; welcomes back the full - time return of Richard Wright (he was mostly left out on &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot;). &quot;TDB&quot; Is much better than &quot;AMLOR&quot;, because it's more intimate and the old magic between the Gilmour, Mason and Wright is back again and they sound better than ever. Gilmour's guitar creates dreamy landscapes, perfect for relaxing after a hard day. Or it's a perfect listen for an early dawn, when the sun is about to rise. Wright finds his old touch again and creates beautiful layered melodies with his keyboards, and Mason is right here to give this album a hard beat.<br />Gilmour's lyrics are much better this time, due to the help by his wife. They're more personal and heart - worming. &quot;Marooned&quot; features some of Gilmour's best guitar work, &quot;Poles Apart&quot; is an out of this world song, &quot;Take It Back&quot; sounds a lot like U2. &quot;Wearing The Inside Out&quot; welcomes back sax - player Dick Parry, last heard on &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, 19 years ago. This song proves that Wright can still sing, because this is his first lead vocal since &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;Keep Talking&quot; is a spaced - out track, featuring the vocals from Stephen Hawking, and &quot;High Hopes&quot; ends the album (a sad one, melancholic sounding) with a ray of hope.<br />Bad songs? - Not in here. From the earth noises on &quot;Cluster One&quot; all the way to the final bells fading out on &quot;High Hopes&quot; this is a non - stop enjoyment that will truly amaze you. An album that should appeal to more than Pink Floyd fans.
6305546789|5.0|Michael Myers murdered his sister on the night of October 31, 15 years ago. He is taken to a mental hospital, where under the care of a doctor (Donald Pleasance) he stays. One night, Michael decides to go for his other sister. Nothing will stop him, he's pure evil.<br /> Halloween is the King of Horror Movies. Noone can say it isn't. It started the whole mask / knife thing. It's not bad for that. It's great for that. Another thing that makes Halloween great, unlike it's sequels and other slashers (Which are good), is that it didn't rely on blood or guts to make a scare. It relied on the use of it's dark and eerie shadows, and great score composed by the film's director, John Carpenter. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her feature film debut here, and she proved she was a great actress. She fit the role of Laurie Strode perfectly; looking like the girl next door. Donald Pleasance, who plays Sam Loomis, the one who knows all about Michael, is excellent. Pleasance's determination with his character made it all the more better. Michael Myers, himself, is a horror icon now. Here, in the first Halloween, the Shape was played by Nick Castle. Castle's actions and eerie movements (When he cocks his head as he admires his work one time) are truly creepy.<br /> The 20th Anniversary Edition of Halloween (I think this is the one, there are so many editions of Halloween) gives a fair look at Halloween. The picture and audio quality are the best I've seen them. The featurette, Halloween: Unmasked, is a great detailed look on the production of the film. We get interviews with John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Moustapha Akkad, PJ &quot;Laury&quot; Soles, Brian &quot;Tommy&quot; Andrews, and Jamie Lee Curtis (on the set of H20). In addition to the theatrical trailer, there's a good supply of teasers and radio spots. There's a Photo / Still gallery of behind-the-scene pictures and movie stills, and also a promotional gallery that shows poster images and such. There's also the option of watching the movie in widescreen or full-frame format. The main menu is animated in a creepy way with the score in the background. Menu changes are animated with the sub-menus being static-y.<br /> Halloween will always stand out as a classic, and will remain one of my favorites.movie in widescreen or full-frame format.

B00003CXS4|5.0|Take for instance, classic/ecclectic music from such bands as the Stranglers, 10cc, John Murphy, The Specials, and Oasis -- and then add fantastic direction from Guy Ritchie with innovative sequences. The movie itself is phemonenal (to say nothing of the DVD package) -- of the order of Merit of British comedy the likes of which need to be duplicated in the era of crummy American Films. As for the Special Edition, well some of the deleted scenes are huge (that is to say, just outright funny as hell) -- however, I can never understand why they (the manufacturers) don't use double sided DVDs and save us a little green. This DVD has the WIDE and the STANDARD view on on side -- why not put the bonus footage on the other side of the disc instead of having a second disc.<BR>All my tiny gripes aside (pertaining to wastefullness) -- this movie will make you laugh -- and you'll have to watch it a few times unless you're British -- to figure out what they're saying! Enjoy, a must-own.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|Not much I can say.  There are some good songs.  There are some weird songs.  My favorite ones are &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;Fly Away&quot;, &quot;American Woman&quot;, &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot;, &quot;It Ain't Over 'Till It's Over&quot;, and &quot;Let Love Rule&quot;.  The rest of the songs on here were radio friendly, but I just didn't see anything special in them personally.  If you just want to own all of the cds that Lenny Kravitz puts out, or if you just want to have a cd with all of his hits just so you don't have to skip through the fillers, buy this.  The only other reason I would reccomend buying this album is that it has the song &quot;Again&quot;.  I think part of the reason that I'm not a huge fan of this album is because even though he's been in this business a while, I think that Lenny Kravitz is a little young to put out a greatest hits album.

They said this book was recommended to read from a higher spirit.<BR>We were symbiont with earth nature, but it has been disrupted as we have craved easy civilized life for our sake.<BR>Now, the higher spirit warns us that the end of human beings that happens in 11,000 year cycle is approaching.<BR>The attack on WTC and Pentagon is just a beginning.<BR>The higher spirit says the earth is dying due to too many destruction of nature by human.<BR>Screening of human beings begins when the earth needs to be protected.
B000002C1V|4.0|Things were getting nasty for Pink Floyd in the beginning of the eighties, as tensions began to arise between Waters and the rest of the band, right about the time Wright was kicked out by Waters (or he left the band, depending on what story you want to believe), and the time when Waters wanted to have everything under his control.<br />And that's why it sounds different from anything they previously released. Basically i would have to agree with the other reviewers as this being a Waters solo effort (although it's much better than his solo albums). But never the less &quot;The Final Cut&quot; has that mystical Floydian feel, thanks to Mason and Gilmour (but their part in making the album was minimal). The Michael Kamen orchestrations are incredibly beautiful, and such are the guitar solos by Gilmour on &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;, &quot; The Final Cut&quot; and &quot;Not Now John&quot; (one of his most powerful and unforgettable). These are the best songs (along with &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; and &quot;Two Suns In The Sunset&quot;) that will definitely stir you up emotionally.<br />Some say it's a continuation of &quot;The Wall&quot;. True, 'cause it has those familiar Waters like themes - death, war, losing a father, nuclear holocaust. Listening to &quot;TFC&quot; is like reading poetry. This is Waters at his lyrical height, with his dark and pessimistic verses. Add his voice that sounds like his about to cry and you get the most emotionally charged PF album.<br />&quot;TFC&quot; marked the end of the Waters legacy, and the beginning of a new Pink Floyd, led by David Gilmour.<BR>If you're just getting into PF this is not the best choice (start with TDSOTM). However, if you get &quot;The Wall&quot;, be sure to get &quot;TFC&quot; after that. It will make the story behind &quot;The Wall&quot; more clear and more complete.
B00003CXX8|4.0|The Glass House has been getting mixed reviews. And that's just how the audience is. They're mixed. You can either love this movie, or hate this movie. I 'like' this movie. I found it to be an entertaining thriller with believable acting and likable or not likable characters. <br /> When Ruby (LeeLee Sobeiski) and Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents are in an accident, they are sent to live with the Glasses, people who used to be their next door neighbors. There's way more plot than that in the movie, but I don't want to ruin anything. There's not much to ruin, but I went into the movie thinking that Mr. Glass (Stellan Skarsgard) was just some crazy lunatic that made his wife (Diane Lane) go crazy too, and they were just out for the kids. Nope, it has more depth than that. I didn't even expect that. There was some suspense at times. Most at the end, but as Ruby goes about figuring out the insanity behind the Glasses in the middle, there are some tense moments. I've got to mention the colors that were used in the film. Or most notably, the colors used at night time in the &quot;glass house.&quot; Shimmers of shades of blue and black flicker on the wall because of the water from the pool outside, but it set the mood for some scenes.<br /> The acting was pretty believable. LeeLee Sobeiski, who reminds me a LOT of Helen Hunt, is a young . . . Helen Hunt. She was awesome. Trevor Morgan, who was last and I guess first seen in Jurassic Park 3, played the little brother perfect. The kid can act. Stellan Skargard was at times, a little too into his character it seemed, and it made him a little bit creepy. He perfected the &quot;quick turn around, I see you&quot; thing. Diane Lane's character should have been fleshed out a little bit more, but she did well with what she did. <br /> I enjoyed The Glass House, but some may think of it as another &quot;Crazy step-parent thriller.&quot; That's just how it goes though.
6305603847|5.0|although the wall is probably my least favorite album made during the period in which pink floyd was roger waters, david gilmour, rick wright, and nick mason, the movie went great with the music.  roger waters is one crazy mofo...he destroyed the band...the final cut, pink floy'd final album with roger waters, proves this, as it was comprised entirely of songs written by roger waters, most of which had been discarded by the band during the recording of the wall.  go figure.
B00004T9UH|5.0|I am 13 years old.  This album has not damaged me at all.  Even though this is edited, pretty much the only thing that's bleeped out is the f-word and some comments about suicide and degrading women.  Now, I'm realistic enough to say that I can see why parents, women, and others are offended by this album.  But the way my parents have raised me is that, if you don't like something, you keep your trap shut, and give respect to the people that do like that something you don't like.  It's really just a matter of taste.  Anyways, the best song on the album is &quot;Stan&quot;.  Other songs that I would reccomend are &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;, and &quot;The Kids&quot; (If you buy the edited version of this album, you get &quot;The Kids&quot; and not &quot;Kim&quot;, and if you buy the explicit version it's the other way around).  I would also reccomend &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, but I think everyone's heard that so many times already that I don't think anyone really wants to listen to it anymore.  In conclusion, if you like rap, especially Dr. Dre, this is a must have album.
B00004TJKI|3.0|Pretty good little, no good, doggedy dogg, &quot;who's the man now dog&quot;, movie. Great performances all around. I thought Ben Gazarra was great. And so young. And Lee Remick, the girl, whoa. She was a looker. Of course George C. Scott and Stewart were great too. Although I thought Stewart did a little too much dramatics.<br />The only bad thing about this movie was that I don't think the ending lived up to the great beginning. I thought it was just a great intro, with great little moments that I so miss in modern movies. And I was a little confused about the courtroom specifics, which are kind of a big deal being that this is basically a courtroom drama. And it's not a bad courtroom drama, just sort of typical.<br />But great beginnng and good dialouge throughout. I think you'll like this more than me Rino. I think it's your kind of old movie.<br />But I give it a B-
B00003CXE7|5.0|If you are interested in movies about the ancient world, this is a sure bet to grab your interest from beginning to end. The story is engaging, while the acting throughout is as superb as the film is graphically violent. This film truly brings ancient Rome to life, and while there is much violence, the few peaceful scenes are quite powerful in their own right. This landmark 2 set-DVD truly represents the full potential of the DVD medium, leaving most of the competition in the dust. There are numerous extras which are a treasure chest of information and insight to anyone interested in the making of Gladiator. The sound and visuals are the best I have ever heard or seen on any DVD that I own. I only wish that all the films on DVD displayed half the quality of this one--too many of them are little more than a video tape on disc. Not so with Gladiator; if you don't own this one yet, buy it, if only to see what DVD technology is fully capable of doing.
B00005B36H|4.0|The fact that Tool is considered mainstream is mind-boggling to me. A talented progressive band on the radio? I never thought it would happen. Tool has made it known that they do not care if they are popular or not, by wearing loads of make up when going anywhere where cameras are present to be comepletely inconspicuous. On Lateralus, Tool seems to push the boundaries of prog-rock going mainstream. Any song on this album will need to be largely chopped up (length-wise) if it is going to be played on the radio. Lateralus is full of one minute seques and eight to nine minute &quot;trips&quot;. Most of the &quot;trips&quot; have two-to-three minute interludes of Adam Jones playing in a trance mode that can become hypnotic at times. My usual complaint on any Tool album is that most of the songs sound very much alike. Jones starting off each track with a group of faint riffs that make your head sway back and forth. Just when you think that the song will never reach any kind of climax Maynard James Keenan begins with his low volume vocals. Then, everything, except another group of faint riffs, will stop for two or three minutes until Maynard comes back to end each track with a vengence along with Carey's exquisitely pounding drums. Lateralus is an album very similar to that of any of Pink Floyd's albums. The art-rockish prog-fests are obviously rooted to Floyd, and even the transition from &quot;Parabol&quot; to &quot;Parabola&quot; is a lesson learned from Pink Floyd. Lateralus may be a little over the top in regards to its progressive edge, but in 20 years it may be considered an amazing album. Lateralus is one of those albums thats legacy will be set by how well it passes the test of time.
B00005NP04|5.0|They say a greatest hits album marks a turning point in an artist's career. Well, if that's true, then Martina sure has gone from country artist to history-making country diva! This album highlights Martina's most spectacular songs of her decade long career. A favorite of many fans, and one who people will remember her by as her trademark song, is &quot;Independence Day&quot;, a very moving and thought-provoking song about domestic violence. At the time it was released, she was on the edge of controversy. Her strong, emotional voice reveals the emotion involved with spousal abuse. Another wonderful song on the album is &quot;Wild Angels&quot;, a very catchy tune that will get you singing lyric after lyric of beautiful music. &quot;Valentine&quot; is a hopeless romantic's best song to listen to. &quot;Happy Girl&quot; is a fast tune that just makes you feel happy! Many of you may recognize &quot;I Love You&quot; from the movie Runaway Bride. Another movie tune is &quot;There You Are&quot; from the movie Where the Heart Is. Martina's voice is so beautiful and womanly, yet her voice has the power to knock you off your feet! This album is definitely worth the buy, just for the 14 previously recorded hits. You will absolutely love the independant woman singing songs like &quot;Life #9&quot;, &quot;Wrong Again&quot;, &quot;Whatever You Say&quot; and &quot;A Broken Wing&quot;. However, it is also worth it to buy it just for the four brand new songs on the album if you already own all her other albums. The new bluesy, rhythmic, fast hillbilly sound of &quot;When God Fearin' Women Get the Blues&quot; will get your feet tapping, fingers snapping and singing along whether you want to or not! &quot;Blessed&quot; is a wonderful conclusion to Martina's Greatest Hits by making us all remember that we are blessed with what we have. I think of the song as a sort of as a 'thank you' to all of her fans that have supported her for the last decade or for all her new fans that she welcomes to this album. I am one of her number one fans, and I recommend this album.  Buy this record, and you will be pleased!es to this album. I am one of her number one fans, and I recommend this album.

B000002TQV|5.0|please undrstand, this i he definitive Radiohead album. This is the Best Album ever made. Though being my favorite does tend to make me lean to the hailing of it, you must understand. This album blends Radioheads rock n roll style with a hint of ok computer. Since Pablo Honey, their first album, every album has ben different and that is what makes being a Radiohead fan so interesting. There are unbeliveable musicians and if you have never listened to or do not own this must of an album, then I feel very sorry for you. Top Tracks include: steet spirit, fake plastic tress, the bends, black star, high n dry, just, planet telex, you know what, the whole ... album is awesome.
0060977493|5.0|Arundhati Roy is not simply a good writer (there are arguably many of those), she is a spiritual genius. This book lay on my bookshelf for two years gathering dust before I ever picked it up- fool that I am! I am a high school English teacher and generally do a lot of reading, but The God Of Small Things made me stop dead in my tracks; stop in the way one stops when told a truth he has known in his heart all along but has never been articulate, brave, or present enough to say or really &quot;know&quot;; stop like a bus stops, or like we fall in love; suddenly and without grace. You finally have to say after reading this book, &quot;so this is the way things really are,&quot; not because Roy tries to convince you, but because you can so clearly &quot;see&quot; it. She paints these lives so rawly, without pretense or preachiness. This book is much, much more than its stunning metaphors, or its language(though beautiful), or its characters-Arundhati says something definitive about the world in which we live and with astoundingly perceptive insight and painful honesty, breaks your heart because her story is about the way you too have lived your life, loving some and not others and &quot;seeing&quot; some and not others. Haven't we all? Characters like Sophie Mol, dead in a box, &quot;bell bottoms and all&quot; who was &quot;Lovedfromthebeginning&quot; and Esta who &quot;just kept on walking,&quot; make us see the terrible power of love and of lovelessness over our lives. One of the most poignant scenes for me was one in which relations from the Indian village in which the novel is set wait all day at a humid airport in their best clothes for foreign relatives who will never love them. The subtlety of Roy's depiction of deeply held emotional apartheid within families will haunt you.<BR>This book is of first rate literary merit, but better than that, it is a yoga class, therapist, insight meditation, poem, lover, friend and philosopher in one. It will hit you all at onceafter about 100 pages and stay with you for years. It will remind you of who you are or even, who you should be. Roy's story for me has been freedom from illusion and the awful oppression of the &quot; crawling backward days.&quot; Who was I before I read this book? I owe this review to Roy and to the world-maybe I can thank her someday. Whatever you do, READ IT!
B00005BJ2O|2.0|Ok. Now I was 100 percent impressed with the movie and I just KNOW someone out here is going to READ my REVIEW but the soundtrack disappointed me. Now I didn't buy the soundtrack through Amazon.com and the titles showing ARE NOT what they appeared on the One I bought in the stores so I might be mistaken here. <br />The reason I rushed out immeadiately to buy the albumn is this. They sang the Show Must Go On JUST AS GOOD as the Original Artists. I was soooooo impressed. Most people who redo a Queen song screw it up BIG time. <br />I am a HUGE Queen fan and to here it in it's entirety impressed me completely. I loved it. And I am soooo disappointed that they didn't include that song on the albumn. <br />It gave the picture more impact. Especially since Freddie Mercury must have known that he had HIV or even AIDS at the tim ehe wrote and recorded it. <br />The music is good but a disapponntment because it would include something like Diamond Dogs on it but not include the Show Must Go On.
0767800958|5.0|This is a most original and beautiful film, particularly for people who love dance. The camera work is excellent and the plot flows smoothly to allow for the maximum amount of dance while still telling a complex and very human story of love. Amazing!
6304578458|5.0|After a totally unofficial survey of friends and family, I still don't have an answer as to why some people LOVE this movie (myself included) while others can barely stand the mention of the title.  Even some people I know who like Denis Leary and other types of dry and/or black humor can't stand this movie (while a cousin who prefers light, romantic &quot;chick flicks&quot; loves it - go figure).  Apparently there is some sort of genetic code that determines if you will like this movie...<br />With that info in mind, the best advice I can give you is to watch the movie (maybe rent it first if you aren't sure you are genetically predisposed to liking it).  You will know within 30 minutes if this is your type of movie, and if you can't appreciate Dan Ackroyd as a hit man trying to unionize his colleagues, then I don't really know what more I can say to make you like this film.  <br />A word of advice, though:  this is not an &quot;obvious&quot; movie. While there are a few action scenes with a 7-11 being blown up and a fight or two, as well as a romance that is reasonably predictable (given that the male is a hit man), most of the humor comes from appreciating each scene in the larger context.  Is a guy who's trying to win back a high school flame anything original?  No, but a guy who's trying to do that while trying not to mention that he dropped out of sight to become a hit man is hilarious.
078401213X|5.0|Pie is my favorite movie. It is the most overrated piece of claptrap monoganism that we are likely to see; thus, I love it sooo much. Its so cool, like that one part, where that guy, like goes into a hole, and he's like \\"Grr! I'm Mr Grumpy Pants! Grr!\\" and he like gets this headache and stuff. It's so awful. In short, u should all see Pie because its so kewl.
0452281881|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and I was initially very skeptical. It sounded too gimmicky and too British for my taste. A novel written entirely in emails sounded like a cute idea, but I figured there was no way it could sustain its narrative for 300-plus pages.<br />It sat on my shelf for months, until I got called for jury duty and needed a book I could read in small chunks and put down at a second's notice. Once I got into it, I became obsessed with the story and the characters and less and less interested in the court case. <br />This book is hilarious. Beaumont is clearly a gifted writer who finds an endless number of clever ways to transcend his book's gimmick, making it an asset rather than a liability. He's able to use people's emails to give us insight into their personality that would never come across as sharply in a traditional narrative.<br />Keep in mind before reading &quot;e&quot; that the format of the book takes some getting used to. It's hard to keep all the characters straight for a while or to remember which ones are involved in which storylines. But be patient. The author is very skilled at differentiating among the email &quot;voices&quot; of his characters, and soon they'll be as three-dimensional as the characters of any great comic novel.<br />Also, if you're an American like me, have no fears that you won't appreciate the British humor. The setting is incidental. This is a book about corporate politics and could probably apply to any country -- and any industry as well (the book is set in an advertising firm, but no matter what business you're in, you'll swear you know people just like these!)<br />If you're in the mood for a fun, easy read, you've found it! I can't wait to read whatever Matt Beaumont writes next!

6303695779|5.0|Slow pans, suffused lighting, sparse dialogue, and indelible imagery, elevate this vampire movie, a complete opposite to the bloody neck-biters of Hammer Films Inc. It's not a movie for everyone. Too slow for some, too actionless for others, Vampyr does carry the stamp of a master, Carl Dreyer. The overall effect is to unnerve rather than frighten. Images collect rather than jolt, passing through to the subconscious where the film lingers long after a last flickering frame. Not a ghost movie, the effect is nevertheless ghostly and dreamlike, with daylight apparitions gliding through some nightless nether nether world. A counterpart perhaps closest in effect is 1962's Carnival of Lost Souls, minus adagio pacing.    My videocassette purchase is obviously a copy of the unrestored original. Titles remain in Danish, with the surreal bits of dialogue untranslated into English, (only pages from text appearing on screen are translated). The sound track crackles and pops with age, all of which might scare off the Sensurround viewer. But for me, the effect was heigtened by these infirmirties of age, rather like finding an old arcane manuscript in original form. Despite the film's vintage, Dreyer's remains a sure hand at the helm, with a rare and delicate sensibility that coheres. All in all, Vampyr may well be a work of genius, and a discovery for modern viewers. But unless you have a taste for the unrestored, stay away from videocassette.

I watched it and I thought it was an ok movie but it was nothing worth much praise. After recently buying and reading the book I noticed that I liked it much better than the movie (which is usually the case) but this is MUCH better than the movie. The movie doesn't express Danny's true powers nor does it express the evilness of the Outlook. I liked the evil hedge animals much better than the hedge maze too!

0812550706|5.0|I have to say that I loved this book, it was very in depth and well written.  I have read several of Card's books and I have loved them all, though I do believe I liked Ender's Game the best.  Ender is a very complex character that once you read through the book, you can't help but feel sorry for him and a little freaked out.  The way Ender does things is to win in one fight, he doesn't draw it out, it just takes one.  The things he does at his young age, in the book, are unbelievable.  Card puts other sci-fi writers to shame with this book.
B00005KJ1G|4.0|This cd is really a mixed bag. Songs like Death Tone, Fast Taker, and Shell Shock aren't bad, but they aren't all that special. But then songs like Dark Avenger, Manowar, and Battle Hymns are absolutely incredible. Highly advised for all fans of Manowar, newcomers may want to start with something else, Hail To England perhaps? (Its my favorite). In response to the review below that says too many songs were written by R. Freidman ands not the band, R. Friedman is Ross Friedman, a.k.a. Ross The Boss, Manowar's longtime guitarist. Anyway, Battle Hymns is a good album with 3 phenomenal songs at the end, hence the 4 stars.
B00005B36H|1.0|Bloated bombastic flatulent nonsense for all the tough-guy mascarad drama-queens of the neo fad age. The musical equivalent of an airport newsagency pulp fiction novel. My life and awarenesses are none the better for this pointless exercise in stadium melodrama. For crissakes, it's just pop music, a trival inconsequential side annexe of the global corporate entertainment industry - hardly Revelations. Why blow it out of all proportion? Tool fans must lead sheltered shallow miserable lives. Wake up, team, and smell the roses. Get out of your sad dog boxes and go camping or fishing or something. Make a fresh fruit salad or an exotic coconut cocktail - do ANYTHING except wallow in this morose pap.
B0000520Q1|4.0|Anyone who's expecting &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; or &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; will be deeply disappointed with this film. But if you're looking for some mindless brain candy to take your mind off things, this film won't let you down. Tom Green's character got on my nerves (an acquired taste, to be sure), but I found myself enjoying the other characters and their escapade from Ithaca to Houston.  In fact, I almost wanted it to go on a little bit longer, because they seemed to get back to Ithaca a little too quickly. But brain candy aside, the central characters actually do each evolve in the course of this flick.  While this was never an Oscar contender, it's good for a few laughs. Anyone who's ever been in college, challenged his/her parents, been off on an adventure, raced the clock, will find something here with which they can relate.  Throw your pretenses to the wind and just enjoy it.  It IS funny.
0671027344|4.0|Stephen Chbosky's debut novel tells the story of Charlie, who, after the suicide of his best friend in eighth grade, is a fifteen year-old high school student living on \\"the fringes of life\\". Charlie is not popular with his peers yet he is not really ostracized: he is a wallflower, 'he sees things, understands, and keeps quiet about them.' Yet there are many things Charlie would rather not keep quiet about, such as the time he sees his sister's boyfriend hit her, witnesses a football quarterback rape his girlfriend, the terminated pregnancy of his older sister, and the truth about his aunt Helen.    As Charlie navigates his way through the corridors of formidable high school, we learn about the colorful characters who influence his life: there is Bill, the first-year English teacher who gives Charlie special books to read and write essays about; Mary Elizabeth, a dominating, opinionated senior with tattoos and a pierced belly button; Patrick, the light-hearted jokester, who educates Charlie about girls, while keeping a secret of his own, and of course, Sam, Patrick's step-sister, whose beauty for Charlie goes beyond her brown hair and entrancing green eyes. In the midst of this motley crew, Charlie begins his transforming journey from adolescence to adulthood, innocence to intensity, with the first experiences of smoking pot, drinking, parties, and \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\". Meanwhile, all of this is relayed to us in the form of letters to a not quite anonymous person whom Charlie loyally writes to several times a month.    \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is like modern-day synonym for \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", excluding the cynicism and abounding in the sensitivity of teen idol Holden Caulfield. Through Charlie, we glimpse a firsthand view of self-examination and sentiments of genuine caring, devoid of the trite negativity and disinterest so characteristic of portrayals of adolescents. There were times when the plot seemed a little stale or hard to follow. I also felt that the author was too willing to accept drinking, drugs, and sex in excessive quantities as normal \\"coming-of-age behavior\\". There did not seem to be a lot of consequences to the mistakes the characters made. Yet the various matters of subjects are handled adroitly, and the ending is a superb surprise which will shock you as it is unexpected and seemingly unfathomable.    In Charlie, we find a young boy swept up into the torrents of the culture around him while desperately looking for someone to guide him on a straight path to maturity. Almost everyone can identify with being a Wallflower at times. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is for those on a quest to feel alive when they aren't quite sure what they are living for yet.

6302859204|4.0|Fire in the Sky was originally a book that was made in to a 1993 movie. I haven't read the book, but I am fully aware of Travis Walton thanks to Art Bell's radio program, documentaries like Overlords of the UFO and countless books on UFOs. I am really amazed at how historically accurate the movie is. The actors, though from 1993, look like they really came out of 1975, the clothing, the hairstyles, the vehicles they drove, the music they listened to. The movie does seem a bit inconsistent to what Travis Walton had actually said. For example, when he returned back five days later, the movie portrayed him as returning naked, when in reality he still had his clothes on. Some of the other content of the movie seemed to exist just to give viewers the creeps so it might be overexaggerated in places. One scene is where the aliens do a gruesome experiment on him by placing some sort of membrane-like blanket over him and his head while the aliens place weird goo in his mouth while using weird machines on him. From what I remember was Walton himself don't remember the aliens doing experiments on him. I guess some of the content of this movie existed for &quot;artistic liscence&quot; rather than being 100% factual. But whatever the case, this is the ultimate scary movie, and if you love this sort of stuff, don't forget to check out the movie adaptation of Whitley Strieber's Communion, that one too really gave me the creeps as well and had trouble sleeping the night I seen both movies.
630204135X|1.0|I hate to spoil the lovefest... yes, I agree with previous reviews as to the greatness of the work, but people need beware the truly horrendous quality of the transfer. The image and sound quality are appalling; it's discouraging that such a cinematic masterpiece gets such slipshod treatment.<BR>My message to the company that released this: get your act together or give the rights to someone who can do the job properly! Don't buy this version!
B000002URV|4.0|Just to let everyone know, I'm no fan of dance music at all. I generally find this type of music to get on my nerves. I like progressive rock, Yes, ELP, old Genesis, Ozric Tentacles type of stuff, so Enigma should be totally out of my league, but then why on Earth do I love it? Because it has some of the most creepy atmosphere I have ever heard on any album, with the probabale exception of Tangerine Dream's Zeit. The idea of blending a genre I can't stand (dance) with a very gloomy electronic ambience, Gregorian chanting and odd electronic flutes actually turned out to be quite appealing. I bought this in 1991, so I was more or less there from the beginnig and I was not one bit disappointed. Those Gregorian chants are real (I heard those chants on some TV documentary without the Enigma beats). And for whatever progheads have heard this album, samples of Aphrodite's Child's 666 are used. &quot;The Voice &amp; the Snake&quot; samples &quot;Seven Bowls&quot; and &quot;Rivers of Belief&quot; samples &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; which leads me to believe that Michael Cretu is a closet prog junkie (or at least likes Vangelis, who was a member of Aphrodite's Child). The first time I became aware of Enigma was seeing a video to &quot;Sadeness&quot; in November 1990, about three months before the American release of MCMXC a.D. and from just hearing that, I knew I had to get the album once it became easily available. This album is sure not perfect. The dance beats do get very samey and it does sound quite homogenous, but the very creepy and gloomy atmosphere makes up for this album's shortcomings. I have heard the next two Enigma releases, but I was not as impressed. The Cross of Changes finds them being more diverse, but the gloomy atmosphere was gone, replaced by the occasional sickeningly sweet New Age that might make Yanni proud, while Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi! attempted to return to the gloomy atmosphere of MCMXC a.D. but was marrd by a couple of rather cheesy numberes, not to mention Michael Cretu singing way too much which become quite grating. That makes MCMXC a.D. the best one. If you want your Halloween experience as creepy as can be, play this.
B000002AVF|5.0|I own all of Mariah's albums and love every one of them equally. But Daydream is something else. I have never heard such a masterpiece, this is the best album ever made - Mariah or not Mariah. Every track on this album is strikingly beautiful in its own way, ranging from R&amp;B to uptempos and pop. I never skip any song. &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, &quot;Open Arms&quot;, &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;I Am Free&quot; are my personal favourites, though, as I've said, all of the songs are excellent. This album is one of the 100 best-selling albums of all times (along with Music Box) and has sold over 24 million copies worldwide. So, even though the chance of you not having this album is really really small, I'd say it anyway: if you don't own this album, buy it now, don't wait any longer!
B00004YM0D|5.0|Remember the Titans has great oldies!!! I am just a kid, but it is still one of the best C.D.s. Even my mom likes it!! This C.D. is worth what ever you pay for it!!
B000002TQV|5.0|This is Radiohead's most honest approach. Unlike the brilliant masterpieces to come, The Bends covers deeply personal ground instead of social criticism and technological dystopia. Fake Plastic Trees sounds like a dying man's last words about a world he cannot change, &quot;it wears me out.&quot; Other songs such as Nice Dream, Bulletproof...I Wish I Was, Sulk, and Street Spirit reflect troubled emotions. Planet Telex, The Bends, High and Dry, Bones, Just, and Black Star cover much more fastly paced territory, giving the album a perfect balance between surrender and the fighting spirit. Radiohead touched upon different lyrical territory with The Bends, and it would be nice to see them touch upon it again...maybe with the next album?
B00003CXTG|4.0|I went to see this movie on its opening week-end. I had heard of all the actors and directors in this movie. I thought it was written very well, by Randall Wallace. And I loved Braveheart, so I thought this would be pretty good also. Now here is my review of the movie, 1.I thought it was a little too long.My rear felt like I had been sitting there from '41-'45. 2.The SFX were great and the acting was good but it could have been alot better. There was just so much too tell it was hard to get it in just one movie.If they had just cut it into two movies and shown them as part 1 in the spring, and part 2 in the fall, it would have been better and you could have put more of the war in, personally my favorite would have been to include the most uplifting part of the war into the movie which was the flag-raising on IWO-JIMA. That would have been a very good closing of what would have been a better film!!!!!
B00005LC1H|5.0|This boxed set is to TV comedy what the First Folio of Shakespeare is to dramatic theater. What makes &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; so great is its simultaneous mastery of both high and low comedy. You get witty references to Brahms and Wittgenstein, soon followed by poked eyes and grabbed bosoms. Basil Fawlty is not only a triumph of comic writing and acting but also one of the most trenchant satires of the British character ever created. (Imagine if Carroll O'Connor had personally written &quot;All in the Family&quot; and you'll get an idea of the scope of Cleese's accomplishment here.) The supporting cast is as nearly as strong as that of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (very high praise): the terrifying Prunella Scales as Lady Macbeth-in-a-bouffant-wig, the lovely Connie Booth (who you'd never guess was American) as the hidden brains of the outfit, and the superb Andrew Sachs as the world's worst bellhop. &quot;The Germans&quot; is probably the funniest half-hour of television ever filmed but all twelve episodes are gems.<br />According to a fan website, there are at least half a dozen real-life hotels that have named themselves after Fawlty Towers. Like Hamlet or Sherlock Holmes, Basil Fawlty has transcended the status of a literary character and in some way become a living being. There can be no higher tribute.

B00003CXD0|5.0|I have never laughed so much at a movie, and yet Tootsie is far more than just your run-of-the-mill, isn't-it-funny-that-a-man-is-dressed-like-a-woman-and-nobody-can-tell Hollywood flick (see Mrs. Doubtfire).<BR>Tootsie has serious ambitions to go along with its classic Victor/Victoria comedy.<BR>Dustin Hoffman, in the best performance of his career, brings a poignancy to his character, playing an actor out-of-work despite his genious because he is too much of a jerk. As Dorothy Michaels, a brassy character in a daytime soap, he becomes a national phenomenon, to the horror of his roommate and his agent.<BR>Features wonderful, career-making performances from Dabney Coleman as the director of the soap, Jessica Lange as Hoffman's love interest and Teri Garr as his neglected girlfriend.<BR>This is an absolute must-see, and can be uproarious family viewing in all but the most puritan of households.

B0000062FL|5.0|For the many new, young Santana fans out there who were introduced to the guitar/Latin music genius through the excellent Supernatural, Abraxas is Santana at his classic best. This is the album that sent Santana to superstardom. Black Magic Woman and Oye Como Va have been staples of rock radio for more than a generation, but the rest of this album is really wonderful too. <br />I was very impressed by the sound quality, given that this album is more than 30 years old. This CD also includes three bonus tracks that weren't on the original album -- live versions of &quot;Se A Cabo,&quot; &quot;Toussaint L'Overture&quot; and &quot;Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen.&quot;
1559409010|5.0|Life of Brain is a little over the top, but for a Python movie it is along ways bellow the top. Terry Jones directs (with terry Gilliam as visual desinger) this movie about the alternate Jesus. Brain was born in the stable next to Jesus's (as explained in a hilarious oppening scence invlolving the three wise men) and goes on to become an accidental Messiah. Brain is played by Grahm, and the other Pythons make continual, skit like appearances. Life of Brian is more of a movie than any of the other Monty Python escapades, but it still doesn't flow as well as a normal movie.<BR>If I wanted to get a freind into Monty Python, this is what I'd show them, most of the humor is something everyone will appreciate, and everyone I know (besdes me) who likes Monty Python says that this is their favorite of the movies (I like Holy grail best).<BR>On the DVD: It has a theatrical trailer (only one, and it is basicilly just movie clips, nothing new added). It has a making of documentery (it gives nice, detailed opinions of the Pythons, by the Pythons as well as an informative look at the way Life of brian was made). It has 5 deleated scences. These are poor quality, but not overlly so. These scences all have a two of the Pythons talking (on an optional audio track). The final, special feature is four British Radio adds involving the Python's mothers telling you to go see the movie.<BR>   The chapters are well organized and placed. There are two derictor cuts, one with Eric Idle (my personal favorite), Terry Jones, and terry Gilliam. The other has John Cleese and Micheal Palin (Grahm died in 1989 from cancer). These cuts are quite nice, pleanty of info about the movie, and some of the personal feeling about the movie in general or specific scences.
6305364648|5.0|...just kidding...But after True Lies, there is a new standard in spy actioners.<BR>This is a James Cameron special-effects mega-blockbuster with a smart script (Ok, there are a *FEW* holes), lots of laughs and great performances....<BR>Scarily prescient, the plot involves these terrorists stealing some nuclear warheads and shipping them to the Florida Keys, from where they intend to fan out across the country and threaten to blow up American cities. Never mind that these terrorists are alternately extremely smart and extremely dumb, the movie moves along at an extremely fast and entertaining pace, with more explosions and chase scenes than ANY MOVIE EVER. Perfect for testing out your Dolby Digital surround sound setup, too.<BR>My wife also really enjoyed this movie, and she NEVER likes action movies, so that's another endorsement for ya.<br />Enjoy!
B000009MF7|4.0|Ravel's concertos are contrived affairs, with the G major work going on past its stay, and the left-hand showcase compressed to the point that any number of measures seem to be missing between the duple-time &quot;Bolero&quot; revisitation and the slam-bang finale.  Maybe if Ravel had been able to write a third concerto, he might have found the right balance between breadth and content, but there are more than a few beautifully inspired musical moments to atone for the mushy organization.  The influence of George Gershwin on both works is blatantly obvious--which is O.K., considering the fact that George and Maurice were, by all reports, friends, and because Gershwin made a career of aping Ravel, Milhaud, and other 20th-century Frenchmen.  Apparently, the liner-note writers have never heard of Gershwin, the most famous American composer during the period these works were composed.<br />Fittingly, pianist Krystian Zimerman plays in a very bureaucratic and technically-flawless style.  Whether Ravel's robotic passages are the cause of this, I can't say, but the approach works, and the 1994 and 1996 Duetsche Grammophon sound is fabulous, with the orchestra and piano in full concord, dynamically.  How often this isn't the case with recordings of, especially, the left hand concerto!<br />The liner notes report that Ravel's waltzes, originally written for the piano and later orchestrated (as they are heard here), were mistaken by 1911 audiences for Erik Satie.  Listen to them to see why.

B00005N9CV|2.0|I am a big fan of Diana Krall from her very first releases but I find the Look of Love release to be too syrupy.  She is moving further away from her jazz roots. I would like to see her re-emerge with the traditional trio or quartet setting which allows her jazz style to shine.  Back to basics would be my advice.
B000003S2K|5.0|I've been listening to this record since it was released, and it still amazes and surprises me.  I always travel with it, as I find it powerfully grounding.  It continues to have an artistic influence on my own work (listen to track #7 from my CD 'A Prayer For The Soul Of Layla'), and I've known it and loved it longer than most of the people in my life.<br />Easily one of the best recordings of the 20th century.
B00004SCX6|1.0|My sister, a former Britney fan, is beginning to tire of her music, thank God!  This album is pure torture.  She can't sing, she can't write, she simply wouldn't survive if she didn't do stripteases.  On satisfaction, she almost sounds as bad as Mick Jagger.  There is no point to this album.  Oops, I think Britney put out another bad album.
B00000I8BX|5.0|fear factory is a great combination of a heavy, angry and softer more 80s sounding, hopeful music.  The story line gives you more of a sence of emotion coming from the different songs.  Another thing i love about fear factory is even if you don't like a song it always has a certain part in it that makes you want to listen to it.  One of my favorite things to do with this CD is put it on a realy big stereo with big speakers and play the beginning of shock REALY REALY loud. My favorite songs are &quot;freedom or fire&quot;,<BR>&quot;descent,&quot; &quot;resurrection,&quot; and &quot;shock.&quot;  The one song i don't like is &quot;obsolete&quot;  it just doesn't sound very serious and the beat is anoying.  The guitar riffs in resurrection are awesome, first it sounds hopeful and uplifting and then just crunches  into some base. 0-0 (where evil dwells)  seems kind of cheesy at first but i realy like the chorus.  when i first listened to fear factory i didn't like the vocals but the music is  just so much better than other bands i like like slipknot and mudvayne.  But after a while i got used to Burton C. Bell's singing.  This was the first ff CD i got and then i boght demanufactured but i havn't listened to that one yet, and im about to get digimortal.  I think soul of a new machine would sound a little to 80s metal for me.
B00005MP58|1.0|One of the best adaptations of Jane Austin's work has been marred by a horrible transfer to DVD.  The color saturation extremely poor and I find it unwatchable.  I have the previous version of the DVDs as well and although grainy and of relatively poor quality, it is much more watchable than the Special Edition.  The best quality I've found is on the VHS versions of the miniseries.
B00003CXWU|5.0|I'll admit the only reason I originally wanted to see BLOW was because Johnny Depp is in it.  I have been a fan of his for a long time.  I think he is so underrated as an actor, and for those die hard fans of his -- this is worth a viewing.  He is totally mind Blowing in this movie.  Words can not describe how wonderful I truly think this performance is.  If I could pick the Oscar winner for best actor this year, I'd gladly give it to Depp.<br />As far as the movie goes, this is a very fast paced, comedy/drama that has a lot of great music. It's the story of George Jung, who was born and raised in Weymouth, Mass. His parents dreams are shattered when he grows up to be a drug dealer.  Jung didn't want to work a real job, so he got into drugs and selling them as a means to make money, good money.<br />He is hardly a sympathetic character nor is he the greatest person in the world.  He isn't a bad person either, I think.<br />He made very bad choices with his life, and his priorities were totally out of whack.  The film goes through his &quot;career&quot; of being a drug lord and pretty much starting the cocaine trade in the USA.  It's a very interesting and entertaining look into the seedy world of drugs.  &quot;Peewee Herman&quot; aka Paul Reubens is also extremely good in this movie as one of George's first drug dealing friends.  This was a good role for him, and I think he did a great job.<br />Rachel Griffiths (of most recently, Six feet under) and Ray Liotta play George's Parents.  I am from Massachusetts and to hear the Boston accent so poorly acted out by these two was excruiatingly painful.  I like Griffiths, she is a good character actress.  I've never liked Liotta, he is just not a good actor at all in my opinion.<br />BLOW is a good rental.  It's one of the best movie's I've seen this year, and has the best performance by a male lead.
0792839730|3.0|Since &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; came out I wanted to check out other movies involving WW II paratroopers.  The movie itself seemed like an unofficial sequel of sorts to &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, with similar source material and the many cameos and big stars of the time.  The movie had great elements, but too often it was bogged.  The best sequences involved Anthony Hopkins as Colonel Frost. Ryan Oneal was completely miscast as General Gavin. I wished they concentrated on a specific event or maybe followed one storyline in more detail than trying to show every aspect of Operation Market Garden.  The DVD itself is bereft of extras and the sound quality is terrible.
B00003CXZ3|3.0|I liked this movie alot, but I found that if I even turned my head away for a split second that I would miss something.  It's the kind of movie that you really need to pay attention to at all times.<br />It was a very interesting idea that was well crafted.  I think that Guy Pearce was amazing in this movie.  It has a few twists and turns that are well worth watcing.  The idea of telling everything in reverse was different, and there were only a few times that I truly felt confused.  (I think my husband asking me a thousand ??'s during the movie didn't help), I just may watch it again to see if I missed anything.<br />It's a original film, and one of the better films I've seen this year.  Worth a rental fee, just be in the mood it.
B00004SCX6|4.0|O.K., you might think I'm weird (my classmates freaked out when I told them)but I like Britney Spears. I just love that rip off cover of \\"Satisfaction\\", and \\"Stronger\\", ohhh, that IS awsome! Actually, the only songs I don't like are \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" because it's terriably produced and is so sappy I just can't stand it and \\"Dear Diary\\" The lyrics are just freaky, ohhhh the lameness, ohh the lameness. If you are an open minded music fan, not if you think you are, you'll love this.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A film noir, with quite a few laughs along the way, told backwards about a man who experiences short term memory loss from an attack that also involved his wife. Since the main character can not remember people, conversations &amp; locations beyond a few minutes he uses polaroid photographs, notes to self &amp; tattoos to ensure his memories are as he can believe &amp; trust. But are they really? <br />While Memento is primarily an enthralling suspense/thriller about a man in search for an attacker/killer, it also delivers intriguing, philosophical reflections by the main character about the accuracy of memories which we develop over a lifetime.<br />I've read that the DVD version would have the option to view the film in a linear, chronological order, however it doesn't. That would have been amusing to watch, however Memento would be a -completely- different film if we -first- heard Teddy's speech in the warehouse in the actual beginning of the film. Memento took a long time to reach people &amp; gain merit which is too bad. It's without a doubt the most original, least passive film I've seen in 2001. Every actor delivers a strong performance &amp; there is nothing weak about this film. <br />Watch it at least twice, Memento is mind-blowing.

B000000OUJ|5.0|We know that there is no such thing as perfection if you're Living In The World Today. So that's why us as human beings look up to our superiors. There is Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods who can define the word perfection better than anyone else. We learn what perfection is by observing them. Now, we can hear what perfection is by listening to the Gza. The Gza has created wonderful flawless hip hop that he pieced together perfectly just like a jigsaw puzzle. Therefore, Liquid Swords was created.<BR>I don't recall the Gza ever hit a bad note in his rhymes, his tongue always slashes as sharp as a kitana. What I adore more about this MC is that he remains calm no matter what his surroundings are. He is arcane and yet, exciting, galvanizing, and lyrically furious.<br />After a chilling intro, we are introduced to the Gza through Liquid Swords. He specializes in chopping up wack MCs, Dueling enemies out of his way with his Iron Mic. And using the most powerfull skill of the Shaolin, which is Tai Chi, also known as Shadowboxing. Also be prepared to be mesmerized by the production of the Rza. Using keyboards(Iron Mic), electric guitars(Shadowboxing), and strings to bring pleasure to our ossicles.<br />Gza is at his very best on Living In The World Today, Gold, Cold World, Lables, and Killa Hills 10304. He spits top notch similes without even breaking a sweat(&quot;Unbalance like elephants and ants on seesaws&quot;). The aforementioned Living In The World Today and Gold are classics. ALong with Killa Hills 10304, which is my favorite track on the album. Gza summarizes a story about a drug dealer and a terrorist over raw Rza beats.<br />Songs like 4th Chamber, and Swordsman are way ahead of its time. The production on both tracks were just &quot;crazy&quot;. It sounded as if the beats went on its own foray, it was just everywhere. <br />There is only one flaw in this whole album. &quot;Investigative Reports&quot;, Well, I thought the beat was a little dull compared to the othertracks. And Gza spitted the same verse he did in a freestyle a year ago. This track still gets props, but it's not as brilliant.<br />This album is probably the best Wu has ever put out. Just about everything was on point. It's the closest to perfection.

B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre's much anticipated album is definately one opf the best rap albums I've ever heard. He's not my best rapper ever, but he definately is amazing when it comes to the beats. this album may even surpass the original 'chronic'. There is a truckload of guests, including Xzibit, Eminem, Snoop, MC Ren, Hittman, etc. You name it, he's on here. My best track on the Cd is 'Ackrite', and the other gems are 'What's The Difference', 'Still D.R.E', 'F*** You', 'The Next Episode' and, of course, 'Forgot About Dre' with Eminem. Very impressive album, the best of 99.
B000001OAA|5.0|This album is so SOLID from Song 1 to song End!

GARBAGE RULES!<BR>Get this CD, and you will NEVER EVER regret it!
0618002251|5.0|As a kid I was fascinated by science fiction and loved, as well, the mythic worlds of earlier times. Among my favorites were the northern mythologies of the Norse and related Scandinavian peoples. I also had a soft spot in my heart for old fashioned Celtic mythology. And so, when I stumbled onto Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS in my teens (a long time ago indeed!), I was practically floored, since it melded all these elements together into a new kind of tale: high fantasy with an epic cast to it. In truth Tolkien's great work grew out of a very deep cultural vein and had many serious antecedents that came before and set the stage for it, both in modern and pre-modern times (the Greek epic cycles, the medieval chansons de geste, the Amadis of Gaul texts, to name a few). And yet, for me then, his tale was entirely new.    I think I read the RING trilogy first, before THE HOBBIT, but am no longer entirely certain. However, in whatever sequence I first found these books, they were utterly delightful and spoiled most science fiction and fantasy for me afterwards because they were so hard to match in terms of breadth of vision, depth of feeling and vividness of the world painted by their author's vigorous and yet very precious prose. Not entirely innovative but largely derivative of the older mythologies, they yet innovated in the way they combined these (Celtic and Norse and Christian and Manichean) into a single and coherent whole.    These books tell an epic tale of a quest to destroy a mighty talisman of power, a quest which combines the world-ending themes of the Norse Ragnarok and end-of-days religious fundamentalism with the uplifting feel of revitalization that grows from a cleansing battle between the forces of good and evil. The world we live in, of course, isn't anything like this but it's a tribute to the vision and power of Tolkien as a writer that our own world seems pale by comparison with the world he invented for us, invented out of the whole cloth of ancientmyths and traditions.    And yet, though I find myself eagerly anticipating the upcoming film, dramatizing the first book of the trilogy (previous animated attempts failed to do it justice), I must say that, looking back on the tale now, I am struck by certain problems with it. Very much in keeping with its northern vantage point (the main source of the Tolkien mythos), it is marred by its apparent linking of goodness with racial types, i.e, the evil orcs and southern men are variously portrayed as dark-skinned, with sloping heads and slanting eyes and as, therefore, somehow removed from humanity because of this. Or at least these external features are used to suggest that removal and to mark them as closer to the corrupting evil of the enemy, Sauron. And, of course, the characters who are the good guys are largely fairy tale types who, while multi-faceted and subject to great temptation, in the end are not fully humanized.    Now Tolkien was writing a high fantasy in a hoary and respected tradition and within those terms he delivered a magnificent and literally flawless masterpiece (complete with invented languages and histories which lend an added aura of authenticity to his work). But his vision was very Eurocentric in the end and I've always wondered how people of non-European background or those who are just sensitive to this sort of thing deal with the awkward stereotyping his vision displayed. It will certainly be interesting to see how the filmmakers handle the more politically incorrect aspects of his great tale. And yet great tale it was and is, despite these minor quibbles, telling a grand story with mighty themes and touching many of the chords which myth and legend generally pluck in our very human hearts. In the end, his is a tale which transcends its cultural biases and speaks, I think, to all of us.    SWM  author of [[ASIN:0738801526 The King of Vinland's Saga]]
B00003CXDZ|5.0|At first when the movie started I thought it was going to be an annoying Inspector Gadget type of movie but it wasn't, it was a masterpiece.  I loved this movie so much!  It has beauty, the drama of the forbidden love affair, tragic death, as well as comedy/parody.   <br />This musical part of this movie gives the treatment many of the popular songs of today deserve or deserved.  I really loved what they did with the music and intend on buying the sound track.<br />Besides being visually spectacular with a rich assortment of odd and interesting characters Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor acted the parts so well! The intimacy they shared was incredibly captured in this film without any sex scenes (amazing, how some people can do that isn't it?  ...  Nicole Kidman as an actress, is not flamboyant, and the director captured her complicated personality very well.  Ewan was perfect for this part also, he was kind and loving and so realistic, they type of guy anyone could fall for.<br />I urge everyone to see this movie, it promotes Truth, Beauty and Love!
B00003CXIY|3.0|I have watched both movies, and although I found &quot;Road Trip&quot; funny it never made me laugh until it hurt as &quot;American Pie&quot; did more than once. Also, Tom Greene's performance is totally secondary. In fact, I didn't like it too much. Check out this flick, though, if you feel like kicking back and watching something that will cheer you up and you will not be forced to think through at all.
0061091480|5.0|This book is a book to live by...I purchased this book in 1976 and have read it over and over...the binding is coming apart and I would be lost without it.  I have underlined passages, earmarked pages and have written notes in the margins ...it has sustained me when I felt I had trouble coping with life's hardships and problems...it is a book everyone should have in their home...my children have read it and anyone I have recommended it to has said almost the identical same thing...buy it...it is worth every word written...definitely a book to live by...
B000002J5K|1.0|The most accurate review, actually, was in the film itself: sotted good ol' boys heaving beer crashing beer bottles against the chicken wire while the Blues Brothers shanghaied someone else's bar gig. That just about said it all. And still does.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I don't want to sound like Roger Ebert or a critic from &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, but that's what &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is. <BR>I LOVE Baz Lurhmann's work and his style. And I loved how they used classic songs from Madonna, Queen, and the Beatles and mixed them in. <BR>I'm so pleased that this was a musical. I love musicals and I've been hoping Hollywood would have the guts to make another. And I have to say, the actors do a GREAT job w/ their singing.<BR>The movie itself is a heavy and the end is depressing, but it is one of my most favorites. BAZ, IF YOU'RE READING THIS, THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS MOVIE!!!
B00005A46T|5.0|Ok just to start out slipknot must be at least a top 5 in most hard rockers eyes. i got this album the first day it came out. i never bought a slipknot album before and i had just herd &quot;wait and bleed&quot; from their debut album so i thought i would check it out. none the less it just blew me away. with corey's vocals, mick's and james's guitar riffs, and joey pounding away at his drums just makes an awsome line up. but add in chris, shawn, paul, craig, and sid you have an incredible and indescribeable masterpiece. i used to be a blink 182 fan and don't get me wrong they're cool but slipknot just blows me out of orbit. My fav songs on IOWA would have to be Peopl=S--t, My Plague, Everything Ends, The Heredict Anthem, and New Abortion. After buying and listening to Iowa i imedietly went out and bought their self-titled album wich i must say is also very good. So if you buy one album this year make it the brutal slipknot IOWA album.

6303269842|5.0|'Maverick' is by far the best western movie ever!  Fast paced, action packed, suspenseful, and funny (very funny), Maverick keeps you on your toes and leaves you screaming for more!<br />Mel Gibson kicks butt (literally) as Bret Maverick, a handsome, slick and roguish card player trying to win enough money to enter the biggest card game of the year.  While trying to win some dough, he meets the scheming thief, Annabelle Bransworth (played by Jodie Foster).  I love Jodie Foster in this movie, I never knew she was such a comedian!<br />'Maverick' is a witty, charming, and hilarous western comedy.  A must-see.
B00003Q43A|1.0|This is easily one of the worst transfers to DVD I have ever seen.  Good sound, generally good picture, but the film 'artifacts' (that is, the picture becomes jumbled, broken up, and stops completely) during high-action sequences, like the massive dogfight against the evil invading aliens.<br />While this is not a problem with newer players, owners of older machines will find this film almost unwatchable.<br />Do yourself a favor, and buy the widescreen VHS instead.
078062999X|5.0|after more than a hundred reviews, there's not much to say anymore: This is one great movie, Shakespeare at his finest. Not being a native english speaker, I would greatly appreciate a DVD edition with subtitles.
044651652X|2.0|This brief book (took me about three hours to finish) has its high points but at other times wallows in unrealistic dialogue and unlikely characterizations.<br />Robert Kincaid is a well-rounded character, but Francesca -- an Italian immigrant turned English literature teacher (!) -- misses the mark after a decent start. Particularly disappointing were the dialogue between Robert and herself, discussing their future, which reads like the author talking with himself; as well as the letter to her children at the end of the book, which sounds as if it were written to two strangers.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana Krall has an amazing voice, that's true.<br />She also has amazing piano chops. Unfortunately, with each album she releases, she chooses to accentuate her voice more than her piano skills.<br />She can do straight-ahead jazz with the best, and I think she sells herself short with this album -- yet another cocktail-hour set.<br />Don't get me wrong -- I love Diana -- but I think she really could use a bit more variety. I'd like to see her come out with another CD with her trio, similar to the &quot;Nat King Cole&quot; collection of 98. That was hot stuff.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone tells one of the greatest stories that have ever been told. It tells the story of Wyatt Earp, his brother Morgan and Virgil, Doc Holiday and thir experiences in the city of tombstone. This movie has a great line up of big name actors and one of the most historically accurate scripts about the west. It shows the way life was in the small cities of the west. In the movie you get an accurate view of how life was back then, from the bars and gambling to the lack of respect people had for the law. The story is filled with personal conflict, romanve, btotherly ties and, as with any good western, a series of gun fights.<BR>Movies are a very popular source of entertainment, and there are a lot of cases where these movies are based on historical events. Though many movies are based on events of history Tombstone is one of the few that is accurate. Tombstone is a great movie and it will be difficult for any producer to creat a movie that will compare to this one. It is definitely an unmatchable classic that will be around forever.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This was a much better movie than most moviegoers expected, following a series of superhero movies about as enjoyable as a root canal. Bryan Singer does a superb job of directing. The script is well-done and very polished - barring a few lines that fall flat, such as Storm's quip about toads and lightning. While I question some of the casting decisions (bad-boy James Marsden as Scott/Cyclops, the quintessential Boy Scout?), the acting was also uniformly excellent, especially Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, Ian McKellen as Magneto, and Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine. The special effects are seamlessly integrated, making each character's mutant powers seem both supernatural and utterly believable, and look especially good on DVD.<br />Now for the DVD itself. The deleted scenes are nice, although most of them were taken out for good reason, as they're just expanded versions of scenes that stayed in the movie. I do like the special option that lets you watch the movie with the deleted scenes spliced in, though...this is a feature that more DVDs should have. The video and audio quality is good, and the extras are interesting and worth a look (I liked the enjoyably hokey &quot;Mutant Watch&quot; documentary).<br />Definitely a DVD worth buying!
0440213525|5.0|This is one of Grishams best.   Easy reading, good story, and should appeal to all readers.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Criterion's Laser Disc Edition of 8 1/2 featured a stunning transfer of this...one of the most beautiful black-and-white cinematography ever shot. Of course, for their DVD edition, we can expect nothing less. And now, you have the great master Vittorio Storaro explaining how another great master, Gianni di Venanzo did all this and how it's important to the art of cinema.... already a hell of a good reason to own the DVD.<br />More than a simple autobiography of a filmmaker, 8 1/2 is a journey into the creative human mind, its agony, self doubts, moral and sexual confusion, and its redemption. The sturuggle of art versus life, and the endless search for a proper ballance. That's why, not only fimmakers but all sort of creative people call this &quot;the best film I have ever seen,&quot; &quot;the film that has influenced my life the most.&quot;<br />Because the film is more a free description of the flow of the human mind, its consciousness as well as its sub-consciousness, than just an autobiography. If you sit back to see just a simple movie in which everything is used to explain a linear story, the film may be confusing. But once you free your mind and let the sweeping camera movements and the stunning, brilliant imagery guide you into the mind of the protagonist-director, I can assure you it will be one of the richest cinematic experience of your life, because then the film allows you to see the reflection of your own psychological life in it.<br />The special feature of the DVD includes a very rarely-seen self portrait-documentary by the genious himself, &quot;Fellini: a director's notebook&quot;. I think it's the first time this forgotten film goes to home video, that's already another good reason to add this DVD to your collection. And it's a very appropriate choice to put this unknown, almost unseen masterpiece to Fellini's own official masterpiece 8 1/2.<br />But a bit distressing, since after all the proper ballance between life and creativity that Felliniseems to have achieved at the end of 8 1/2... well, when you see &quot;a director's notebook&quot; you see that the conflict is not resolved at all! But then to see &quot;Notebook&quot; and then go back to &quot;8 1/2&quot;, you may be able to see it in a different perspective, so that's great!!<br />Life is a constant inner search and inner struggle; whether you will suffer from it and try constantly to escape, or you'll make your mind up to enjoy it since it will never go away anyway, that's up to you. And 8 1/2 is a film that will give you that energy, because it's also so funny. So get this DVD, and it sure will be a great companion to your entire life.
B000002AT6|5.0|The legend would not be the same without the music, because the music embodies the legend. To say it simply, this soundtrack is nothing short of beautiful. 5/5 stars, bar none.
0345350499|5.0|I have just finished &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; by Marion Zimmer Bradley, and have found it to be a great achievement not just in the fantasy genre (where it surely stands as a giant) but also in the literary genre as a whole.  What Ms. Bradley has done in the course of these nearly 900 pages is nothing short of astonishing.  She has managed to synthesize one of the largest and most varied myth/legend cycles in history into a complete, coherent volume, managing to rationalize and explain the numerous variations of names, characters, places, etc. both within the myths themselves as well as history.  The characters are thoroughly real, imbued with a life that makes you feel for each of them in turn.  You find yourself holding the same deep reverence for Taliesin that the characters do, and the same contempt for Gwenhwyfer's stupidity and zealous dogmatism that Morgaine or Morgause does, while also pitying her desperation, and admiring her devotion.  <br />Some have criticized the very obvious favoritism shown to paganism in this book.  I would counter than with the argument that the Christianity that is displayed here, the oppressive strain which emphatically denies and destroys all other gods, is not one to be favored.  The paganism displayed here isn't what the ancients practiced, it is influenced heavily by modern NeoPaganism.  However, the brand of Christianity practiced by the likes of Gwenhwyfer and Patricius is frankly historically accurate, more or less.  We know how Christians of the time operated, we don't know how the pagans operated.  She has had to create something new, and in light of the rest of the story and it's feminist slant, the favoring of the gyno-friendly paganism was only natural.<br />Bradley's novel is a monumental reimagining of one of the most famous myth cycles in history, and she does the job admirably, fairly, and thoroughly.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Hilarious. I've laughed louder and harder at very few movies like I laughed at this.  Well written and acted, and the dialogue is second to none. The big movie studios dont understand that intelligence in the audience exists, and the success of Clerks proves it. Plus, Kevin Smith is from the 80's generation, and gre up on John Hughes films like most of us, and makes his characters just as witty, and even vulgar, but funny vulgar.  He proves that talking about sex is always dirtier than seeing sex.
0515123447|3.0|My first book by Lee Child. It was good enough that I will get another one but it was not great. Jack Reacher is picked up by the police department for murder. He has only been in town a short while and has committed no crime. The story goes from there to finding cops on the take as well as others in the town. I kept thinking Reacher would change into a Superman costume. He can take out as many men as they send and no harm to him. Parts of the book was very unbelieveable. However, part of it could really hold your attention. There was to much detail about the printing of the money, in my openion. All in all a fair read. If you like a lot of action with a super human and all turns out well, this is the book for you.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Pearl Harbor was supposed to be a combination of action, history, and romance, along the lines of the far superior Titanic.  Unlike Titanic, this movie has a terrible script, moronic dialogue, mediocre acting, confused and distorted history, and nothing worthwhile to say about life, love, war, or anything else.  I found myself squirming in my seat and looking at my watch for the first 1 1/2 hour of this movie.  In short, one of the very worst big-budget movies in many years.  Anyone looking for somewhat realistic WWII action flics should consider Tora, Tora, Tora; Midway, or A Bridge Too Far.  One of the finest films about WWI was the Australian production Gallipoli.  Any one of these on video or DVD is a better pick than Pearl Harbor.
B000003S09|3.0|Sorry, i can't share my opinion with most of the reviewers here. &quot;In the court...&quot; could be a classic, as &quot;Srg. Peppers lonely hearts club band&quot; and &quot;The dark side of the moon&quot;, or a perfect one as &quot;Soft Machine 2&quot;, but it isn't. &quot;In the court..&quot; has its classic moments with &quot;21st century...&quot; that is a classic rock, &quot;Epitaph&quot;, &quot;In the court&quot; and the 2 best - &quot;Moonchild&quot; and &quot;I talked to the wind&quot;. The young band sounds so beautiful and so perfect, and above all - Greg Lake, that introduces us to the black psychodelic world of Fripp. But as we learned by the time, perfect harmony is not possible in Fripp's music. Strange noises &quot;must&quot; enter the songs and make them long, boring and not very plesent to listen. I accept some of these, by having 5 or 6 albums of the band (from all generations), but the distance between KC to classic is long. I'm writing this review about 30 years after the album was released, and thinking that history of rock music, and especially prog. rock, supports me. It was sensational in the early 70's, but far from being relevant to us today. Youngsters who listen to that album won't understand what the hell went wrong in the studio. To me, &quot;In the court...&quot; missed the ball.
B000001F5A|5.0|I had enjoyed this cd many years ago and had misplaced it.  Recently I heard a friend's cd player and it sounded so similar that it once again reminded me of the joy this cd brought me.  I came and found it here and when I heard the first refrains....my mind instantly relaxed and memories poured in.  Some portions of the cd instantly bring tears and some bring excitment.  The entire cd is a masterpiece of music.
B0000029GA|5.0|Everything there is to say about this album has already been said.  It is the best hip hop record ever made in my opinion.    I just wanted to say that although Jay-Z is right that Nas has completely fallen off, he seems jealous that Illmatic can still by itself blow away anything Jay-Z has ever spit.  period.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|When one thinks about how many albums Dylan has made, and how much great music there is spread through them, one inevitably assumes that at some point his well will run dry. Well, it hasn't, and in fact Dylan has now produced two wonderful albums in a row. The songs are rich and varied,the lyrical twists and turns alternately funny and wise, the band tight and the singing superb, memorable and drenched with feeling. Dylan has made a lot of wonderful albums in his career, and a number of duds. This is unquestionably one of the wonderful ones.
0440219078|5.0|Lowry's Novel, The Giver describes a world of sameness and the inability to make choices. Nobody except for one person is capable of feeling pain. Everything in their world is in black and white. Jonas, the protagonist of the novel, starts realizing that sameness is boring and that people should have feelings and be able to make choices. Read the novel and find out what happens. I enjoyed the book, yet finding it very emotional in some aspects. I am glad that we don't live in a world of sameness.
B000006TZ8|5.0|All Mod Cons is undeniably the best album released by The Jam. Some may argue that Setting Sons is, but in my mind All Mod Cons, sums up the essence of The Jam. Paul Weller's writing on this album was huge departure from the 2 albums released prior to it and this album clearly demonstrated the classic Jam sound. This is a 'must have' album for any fan of The Jam, or any Mod fan for that matter.
0688170528|5.0|This is the third book by Jodi Picoult that I've read. And I'm currently reading a fourth! I think what is amazing about this writer is that she manages to pull the reader into the story. I certainly felt all the emotions of the characters: Gus' despair at losing her friend, her shock at what her son reveals to her;  Emily's anguish; the gamut of feelings that Chris undergoes....and so on. I also discovered that up to the last chapter of Ms. Picoult's books (those that I've read)there is going to be the unexpected and that makes it really difficult to put down her books. Super reading!
B00000AFFF|5.0|Disparite aesthetics? Elvis Costello, who TWENTY YEARS AGO was an angry, clever, and vicious punk-pop genius, and Burt Bachrach who FORTY YEARS AGO was a clever, ochestral-pop genius decide that they can meet, and work together. Bachrach's gorgeous melodies and Costello's ascerbic words meld into this finely-honed collection of songs that left me reeling with admiration.<br />I've read a lot nonsense from people who dislike this music because they think that Elvis has lost his edge, but these people I believe are living in a past long dead. Besides, Elvis Costello has been on an upward artist trajectory for his entire career. Listen to King of America and this, and you'll see there isn't all much difference in terms of song quality. Bachrach is incomparble, and his work influnced so many others. It is still listenable. On its own terms, even if I were not a fan of both composers (it's possible, yes, without hallucingens), I would say that this is finely-crafted pop that is rich with irony, insight, and melodic invention. You can't ask for better in this vein of popular music. If snotty guitar riffs over snarls is all you want, there are plenty of lesser lights out there for you to drool over. As for me, I'll take this masterpiece.
B0000013GT|5.0|Along with Aquemini, this is one of my favorite albums of all time. At first this album may seem a little bit out there. When you look at the the cover, they look like some \\"aliens or genies. But once you start listening you realize how good songs like \\"Wheelz of Steel\\" and \\"Mainstream\\" are. Then the rest of the album just falls into place. People who don't own the album may have heard the radio songs \\"ATLiens\\" and \\"Elevators\\". If you think those are good but haven't heard the rest of the album, then you're in for a treat. The rest of the album is just as good and better in many cases. This album is also really good for people who like to blaze it up and listen to some music that will really f#%k with you. Overall it is an excellent album for anybody and if you haven't heard it, I would recommend getting it.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Bush meets Nirvana meets the 21 Century. <BR>This album is full of great rock tunes that exceeds current bands such as Linkin Park, Papa Roach etc.<BR>Tack 2 'How You Remind me' is the best, maybe cos it was the first tune I heard that made me buy the album. Usually if the first track released from an album makes it big then the rest of the album must be great too.<BR>Now this band is not very big in the UK where I'm from. Get these on tour quick fast.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I've had this CD for 4 months now, and I can say that it is the best $15 I've ever spent. I've listened to every single song on this album multiple times, and I can honestly say I love every one of them. HOWEVER, I happen to love Brit-pop, which, as a rule, tends to be A LOT more experimental than your average N'SYNC album. This album, while it obviously has hip-hop influences, is probably best seen as British Pop/Rock, but it actually transcends any genre. In short if you are the type of person who only listens to one or two genres of music, you will probably not like Gorillaz.
B000002H33|5.0|this is a classic possibly the best album of all time
B000005J56|5.0|This CD is addictive, hypnotic loaded with dark beauty.  The first four chords (of &quot;Chan Chan&quot;) are full of lush menace, like a gunslinger's spurs entering a bar, scary enough that you can't raise your eyes from those feet.  The rhythm of &quot;El Carretero&quot; similarly grabs you and won't let go - taking you where?  But it's &quot;Candela&quot; that I always anticipate. What can one say? Only thanks for the English translation of Ibrahim Ferrer's improvisation. If he's this switched on at 85, I only wonder...

0060922583|5.0|All the pieces fall together and make sense now. It's a pity we won't be seeing more books from Michael Talbot, to guide our steps on our paths in this holodeck called Earth. But at least Michael is seeing it all from the &quot;other side;&quot; his untimely death occurred in May 1992 (I only found this out while trying to search out more about him on the Internet). Be well, Michael Talbot ... and thank you.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Released on the same day as the World Trade Center terrorist attacks, Dylan must be feeling shell-shocked himself. How trivial and unimportant &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is compared to the world-changing events that forever affected every US citizens lives that day. But you know, this is an excellent CD, totally and completely representative of the best of Dylan's works since the 60's (and through the 90's). Now, think about how many times Bob Dylan has affected YOUR life through his music; he doesn't offer redemption, he doesn't offer answers, he doesn't explain why life is LIFE; but he describes it better than any other artist on this planet. And that in itself can help you through another day. His guitarist on this CD, Charlie Sexton, wrote one of the most memorable and dynamic songs you'll ever hear in your life back in 1995 on his own album &quot;Under The Wishing Tree&quot;. The song was &quot;Plain Bad Luck and Innocent Mistakes&quot;. That title alone sums up how Bob Dylan's career has forged ahead; but mostly with amazing results. &quot;Love and Theft&quot; is one of the best musical experiences you will ever find - luck and mistakes notwithstanding.
B00005NIE1|5.0|I was lucky enough to get this album in July, as it came out earlier in Australia than the USA, and let me tell you, it is one of the greatest albums I have ever bought. This album has a raw, rock feel to it. There is no electronica on this album, it is good, bouncy rock in its purest form. It is also an album that has no particular stand-out tracks, as they are all so brilliant. Every track is worth listening to again and again and again. My favourite track is probably the single,&quot;The Modern Age&quot;, but I think that each track has been my favourite track for a period. Great Album, highly recommended
0307155102|5.0|This is really &quot;the best word book ever&quot;.I have got it when I was ten and I started to learn English reading it. I started to enjoy the book again when my son has been trying to say his first words in our language (Croatian). Now, when he is four, he is learning to say the same words in English. He adores the book,the animals in it, doing the same things he is ...<BR>The book is the best!
0345428064|5.0|Plenty of action/thriller writers can talk the talk, but only Andy McNab can walk the walk. That's why the Colombian drug cartels and the Provisional IRA still have contracts out on him. McNab doesn't have to imagine how these things work - he KNOWS, and he tells his tales in the sure knowledge that his plots and descriptions carry the authenticity that other writers lack.<br />Remote Control follows agent Nick Stone through a storming story of IRA duplicity, murder and drug dealing. Curiously, at the time that I write this review, terrorist funding is hitting the world headlines following the despicable atrocities at the WTC and Pentagon. Andy McNab (with no foreknowledge of these events) points out that many citizens of USA have been funding the IRA for years. It's strangely ironic to be reminded of that now that USA needs the support of the rest of the democratic world. I guess one man's terrorist is another man's hero (?)<br />I notice that other reviewers point to a seeming weakness in the story regarding Nick Stone's relationship with seven year old Kelly, whom he has saved from his parents' murderers. I think that this awkwardness between the two characters is quite intentional, highlighting the emotional difficulties of any special agent who is trained to kill without sentiment.<br />Remote Control is a real page-turner of a book, delivering action that is just this side of out-of-control, and a plot that oozes authenticity. There's no doubt, almost from the outset, who the real villains are, but that doesn't lessen the suspense. How will Nick Stone get himself out of the mess and how will he save the little girl? Particularly since he's on a deniable mission and his British spymasters have disowned him. If you want to read a thriller that tells is as it really is, Remote Control is the book for you.... Five well-earned stars.

The picture is quite good, and the new voices are much better than the previous VHS version.  The 3 children have very young kid sounding voices and it adds to the creepiness of their characters.
0679879269|5.0|This book has the best opening I have ever read. A beautiful description of the valley where Mrs Coulter is hiding with Lyra, it doesn't get boring like other lengthy descriptive openings, but engages and awes instead. Pullman's mastery is immediatly apparant, as he slowly shifts the viewpoint - &quot;zooms in&quot; - to Mrs Coulter's daemon, all the while using immaculatly beautiful description. The rest of the book, thankfully, lives up to this opening. With astonishing revalations, dramatic events and a superbly touching ending, this is probably the best book I have ever read - the only question mark is whether another comes joint. The beauty of this novel is it is one of the rare ones (like the rest of the trilogy) that has both incredibly good description and a truly engrossing clever story - and great philosphical ideas too! It is only a shame Pullman's work outside of this trilogy isn't as well written - if he writes a few more books at this standard he could be the best living fantasy writer, but this trilogy is more than worth checking out for any fantasy fan anyway.
6304211740|2.0|The first time I watched this movie, I loved it.  I thought it was a great romance and had wonderful scenery and acting.  Then I read the book.  I now cannot sit through this movie without feeling like I am being tortured.  The movie had so many inaccuracies that it might as well have a different title.  This is beyond dramatic license.  People who, in the book, never even met each other were having conversations, family structures entirely changed, scenes that never happened added.  For what purpose, I do not know.  The book is so full of wonderful dialogue and emotion, the movie cannot live up to this.  I am very disappointed and will never be able to watch this version again.
B00001NFCY|5.0|First thing, if you didn't like With Arms Wide Open, it doesn't mean you won't like the album - though it is an incredible song, the rest of the album is more metal, with power chords running throughout all the songs. The songs can seem a little samey at fist, but they all rock anyway, and when you get to know them they are actually really different. Creeds habit of switching from beautiful guitar notes to powerful crashing chords is used very well, and Stapp's vocals, though a little pretentious at times, are generally incredible and really work with the music. An album that has gone diamond - sold over 100 million copies in the US, which fewer than 100 albums have done - due to its sheer quality rather than mass-marketing pop tunes, it really is an essential buy, and it's great to see a christian band (yes they are, look at the &quot;thank you&quot; section on the sleeve and listen to the words sometime) doing so well.
B00004RJ74|5.0|George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino star in this gangster/vampire crossbread that is, without a doubt, the best movie ever made. What sets this horror movie aside from others is that rather than killing off central characters from the start Scream style, it dedicates the entire first half to character development. This allows the audience to begin to actually care if a character dies or not. The story centers around a violent pair of outlaw brothers named Seth and Richard Gecko and an unwitting family they kidinap to help get them and their loot across the Mexican border. Once they get their they go to hide out in a sleazy bar where they stumble across an ancient den of vampires. Clooney and Tarantino, who spent the summer before shooting began together so they could interact in a believable way are one of the best on-screen duos in history. They are very diffrent and Clooney's(Seth) charm and charisma are the exact opposite of Tarantino's(Richard) menacing and creepy performance as a sex-offending dork from hell but even though the opening sequence characterizes the two as unrepentant killers the viewer still can't help but root for them. This is one of the rare movies that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. I would highly recommend you check this movie out as long as you can stand a little violence and bad language.
0375703764|4.0|An interesting note on this novel: the book was co-released with the album &quot;Haunted&quot; by singer-songwriter Poe (best known for her 1995 hit &quot;Angry Johnny,&quot; and who is, in actuality, Annie Danielewski, sister of Mark.) &quot;Haunted&quot; has songs that correspond with various themes and concepts in the book &quot;House of Leaves.&quot; It's advisable that someone who reads this book also listen to the album before, after, or better yet, during.<br />The two rely so heavily on each other for total comprehension that Mark and Annie toured the nation together at the time of their releases, alternating between song performances and narrating chapters of the book.
0393038912|3.0|While I will not suppose myself as a top literary critic, especially for a Pulitzer prize winner like this, I do have some thoughts to share. On the positive side, it had an interesting content and approached a difficult topic in a different light that I personally had not seen before. The examples were clear for the points made.<BR>Now for the other side of the coin. The 480 pages make for a very long read. Add to this length a tendency by the author make the same point over and over and over and (you get my point) in the delivery of views. It made the book feel like 1480 pages. In my mind, this really took away from the arguments presented as it seemed to be very deliberate and not just some kind of writing style.<BR>Read it anyway - I see there is now an abridged version - so get that one instead of the original.<BR>Note that 2.5 stars rounds up to 3
B000001EHS|5.0|Perfect if your first getting into Def Leppard!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is simply amazing - a movie that sucks you in while you watch, deeper and deeper, then ultimately leaves you puzzling for weeks about what it was all about. The plot has been covered extensively in previous reviews, so I won't go into that.  The performances are outstanding all round - Guy Pearce as lead character Lenny is perfectly cast as the confused, vengeful husband.  Joe Pantoliano, as the shady police contact and Carrie-Anne Moss as the sexy bartender are also brilliant: Moss in particular seems to relish her role.  This is a movie for the ages, one to be talked about with friends over drinks.  It raises more questions than it answers - about the human condition, reliability of memory, the power of relationships and context and the confusion of the mental conditions. It is tough work to follow at times, but the satisfaction gained from thinking about the movie makes it one of the best movies of the last 5 years.
B00005A1PR|3.0|The artist has a beautiful voice and the CD is a good listen.  Lyrically it is above-average but I found the tribute to all artists that came before her wedged in between the tracks distracting...especially if you shuffle/mix your CD in a multi-disk player.  Overall, a solid debut.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is exellent! Really its the best mix and overall tone in a heavy metal album that I have ever heard. First off Bruce Dickinson's voice cuts you to the bone like a butcher's knife, second off Steve Harris proves for the 16th time that he is the ultimate god of bass guitar and song writting, third off the drums are so clear and yet so punchy that if you turn it up loud enough you'll swear that the neighbor's are shooting cannons in their front yard. ( Also on a side note Nicko McBrain's single bass drum foot is faster than many of todays double bass drum players.) And fourth off each of the three guitarists (Dave Murray, Janick Gers, and Adrian Smith) Have simply the most killer tones and playing ability along with the best writting creativity I've heard on a Maiden album. Over all you can tell that these guys have been around long enough to know how to make the best metal album ever. Everything is perfect and everything is headbangable. This is a true triumph for all of heavy metal and a blow to face of pop music, rapcore, nu-metal, death-metal, and whatver else that sucks. UP THE IRONS!!
0380973650|4.0|I have read all of Gaiman's novels, as well as the Sandman graphic novels. I'm a fan of urban fantasy, and, needless to say, I'm a fan of Gaiman's work. I was especially anxious to read American Gods because a good portion of the story takes place in my home state, Wisconsin (home of snow, ice and Culver's custard.) I was not, generally speaking, disapppointed. American Gods has everything I like about Gaiman's stories.<br />The story opens with Shadow, the protagonist, being released from prison a week early to attend his wife's funeral. Shadow is a big man, strong in both stature and integrity. On his way home, he meets Mr. Wednesday, who offers Shadow a job as bodyguard. The pair travels the American heartland, drumming up support for a coming spiritual war. Along the way they meet a host of unlikely characters, includ and thugs with names like Mr. Town, Mr. Street, Mr. Woods and Mr. World. And not least among this cast of extremely interesting characters is Laura, Shadow's deceased wife who spends most of the book bailing Shadow out of tight situations. And rotting.<br />I docked the book 1 star because, in my opinion, the ending fizzled. Also, interspersed through the book were short stories that were removed from the main storyline. These were a nice break between chapters, and offered insight to 'the coming war' in other parts of the nation. For some reason, these stories stopped about 1/3 of the way through the book, and I sort of missed them.<br />In summary, I think that American Gods was a far stronger effort than the last book of his I read, Stardust, but not as good as Neverwhere, or Sandman.

This book has the interesting characters and dialog that I love about Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's snappy wit (after all that he's written, how can he keep coming up with stuff that's so funny?!)<br />I laughed out loud several times while reading Good Omens, something I've not done since reading Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

0783229526|5.0|Plot Line (from back cover of film's package)<BR>When a writing assignment lands journalist Raoul Duke (Depp) and sidekick Dr. Gonzo (Toro) in Las Vegas, they decide to make it the ultimate business trip. But before long, business is long forgotten and trip has become the key word. Fueled by a suitcase full of mind-bending pharmaceuticals, Duke and Gonzo set off on a fast and furious ride through nonstop neon, surreal surroundings and a crew of the craziest characters ever! But no matter where misadventure leads them, Duke and Gonzo discover that sometimes going too far is the only way to go.<BR>My remarks toward this picture<BR>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is simply one of those movies that you'll either love or loathe. It's a pseudo-psychedelic, very colorful and stylized comedy that's-in my opinion-so funny, so excruciatingly funny that the mere thought of it will draw a smirk on your face, and perhaps even have you laugh, then! <br />While it, to many, seemed as being a painfully long and senseless film, it really defined the counterculture of its day. Needless to say, with characters who'll suppose of such mind-bending pharmaceuticals as daily substances to indulge upon, unnecessary close-ups of vomit and urine, and swooping camera movements at any and every opportunity, this very atypical and repellent film is certainly not for everyone. (\\"We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls... But the only thing that worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge,\\" Duke narrates to us.) <BR>But for the self-seeking and fans of either Hunter S. Thompson or Terry Gilliam...<br />Although it was clear that the film hadno real plot line to support it, no shape, trajectory, or purpose, that did not matter-to me, anyway-because it regards these two characters, Duke and Gonzo, and if you'll find them appealing to me, if you'll like them, then so will you like this film. Why do people enjoy such innovative television sitcoms as Seinfeld? It has absolutely no plot line to it, no objectives by any means; it's about nothing. So why is it that it has become one of the primary choices in popular culture? -Because we enjoy seeing these four comical characters' every day lives...about nothing; they entertain us, as both Duke and Gonzo had entertained me. It's all about them, you see. It's all about their world, which is frequently seen entirely through their eyes, thereby generating greater sidesplitting and outrageous moments as the images and events they think they're seeing further affects their mental stability. We see these guys rambling fatuously past the eccentric backdrops of Las Vegas while zonked out of their minds. We see them take more drugs, get themselves into new situations, fall about, flounder, wreak havoc, and retreat to their hotel suit, and oftentimes these events will be introduced by Duke himself as the narrator who comments on them. Now, humor relies on behavior. Beyond a particular point, you don't have a behavior, you reside a state, but that was okay, because I, as I have previously said, liked these characters, and although there reached a point when they no longer made me laugh as hard, their lives, somehow, in an awkward way, still managed to entertain me. Also, I enjoyed all of the visuals and computer-generated scenes.<br />Director Terry Gilliam, a master of complex, bizarre visual imagery, does such an outstanding job in capturing the exact agitated tone, intensity and utter madness of Hunter S. Thompson's classic book, which really came as to no surprise whatsoever, for the book itself was used as their screenplay. For the first time ever, a book was used asa screenplay, and the result is astonishing! Usually after having finished with a book that's based upon a film you've previously seen, you wind up saying to yourself: the film was nowhere near as good, unlike for this title, where both the film and book equally major and have the same fine quality in a twisted kind of way. And, like the book, Gilliam really has you feel for these very dysfunctional individuals who, as you sit there and observe of the many risks they so carelessly make, you form a special care for and don't want anything fatal to happen to.<br />The performances were just incredulously stunning! In fact, these vivid actors were so persuasive, you'll forget of the fact that they were even acting at all, let alone whom they were portrayed by. The very underrated Johnny Depp clearly proves that he's a worthy actor who'll be willing to do anything for whatever roll that strikes his taste (rather than those that would strike moviegoers'), as this one had following his approbation upon Thompson's inspirational book, which also had an affect upon Benicio Del Toro, who, when gaining that much weight for a roll, you know he's committed. (And did you see Depp's bold scalp? It was amazing!)
6305546789|5.0|It's impossible, in a sense, to see this film for the first time. Because even if you haven't seen it before you've seen most of its best tricks copied in thousands of vastly inferior slasher films. Some of the freshness is inevitably lost, when you see the imitations before the innovator. (The first time I saw _Halloween_ it was being projected onto the wall of a deconsecrated and very drafty old church, with myself almost the only male in an audience of squealing social work students... The best possible atmosphere for encountering a film of this kind, and that memory may mean that I tend to forgive this film some of its faults. But I'll try to keep this objective.)<br />Basically _Halloween_ rethought and refitted what was then a stale genre, horror, (the genre is stale again now, mainly because it's lived off _Halloween_'s innovations for over 20 years).<br />Some of _Halloween_'s innovatiuons are easily recognised. One is the now-compulsory scene in which the heroine (or occasionally the hero) has dispatched the killer and leans back panting, exhausted but finally safe... Now we know, whenever we see a scene like that, that the killer is bound to sit up suddenly from the floor, the bath, the grave, etc, and have one last attempt to kill the Last Girl Alive before being defeated again, even more desperately.<br />These days just the sight of the heroine starting to relax is enough to put us on our guard. But when John Carpenter brought back the apparently mortally wounded Michael Myers at the end of _Halloween_ it was new, something genuinely unexpected and shocking.<br />Other Carpenter improvements to the genre include the newly relentless pacing. He made things happen faster, streamlining the shock delivery mechanism so that the audience has less time to relax between shocks. Watch an older horror movie and you'll see the difference; even schlock directors like William Castle take their time, excruciatingly slow compared to the faster tempo set by Carpenter. Carpenter also subverted the rhythm by which horror films deliver their shocks. Before Carpenter the experienced horror audience knew that after each scare you could be guaranteed 10 to 15 minutes of exposition and tease, with no futher surprises. Horror punches were well apart and well telegraphed. Carpenter changed that; not only was the action faster, but the scare peaks came at random and largely unpredictable moments. The audience quickly learned that there was no time in which it could relax.<br />Other features of this film, such as the use of movement at the edges of the frame are brilliantly well done, but there Carpenter is borrowing and adapting rather than innovating. The power of Carpenter's soundtrack is another notable feature of this film, but that is also less groundbreaking; the immediate models are Mike Oldfield's music for _The Exorcist_, and in a different sense Bernard Herrman's superb _Psycho_ score.<br />Some of Carpenter's other innovations are less positive. The film didn't exactly do much to increase sympathetic understanding of former psychiatric patients, but maybe we can live with that. But the vengeful and puritanical subtext in which those characters who have sex get killed, while virgins survive, is one of the slasher genre's less attractive features, and it is something that is largely taken from this film's template.<br />On the other hand Carpenter also pioneers the phenomenon of the Last Girl, in which evil is defeated not by the boyfriend, as in most teen horror movies made prior to _Halloween_, but by a heroic and resourceful young woman. The &quot;last girl&quot; (in this case a powerful performance by an astonishingly young Jamie Lee Curtis) has become a feminist icon, and a partial counter to the horror genre's general mysogyny. Carptenter also creates several genuinely likeable, ordinary-girl characters; he quite efficiently makes you care what happens to his mostly female cast.<br />So this is a hugely inventive and original movie, which ironically suffers because it was so influential. People who come to it after seeing its imitations (which means more or less any horror film made after 1979) may miss how radical and fresh this film was. Scenes that are cliches in films like _Scream_, _Last Summer_ and so on, are not cliches in _Halloween_: here they were _new ideas_.<br />In its own modest way _Halloween_ is a classic, the _Ivan the Terrible_ of horror films. It's certainly the most genuinely scary horror film I know. One reason for its scariness, compared to the usual run of horror films, is that its monster is both credibly part of everyday life and genuinely frightening. I can't raise a real shiver over a supernatural creature like a vampire, ghost or devil. Suspension of disbelief is seldom really complete; I can't take them seriously enough to be scared by them.<br />But an unreasonable and unreasoning nutter with a big knife is a different story; dangerous nutters are part of the real world and something genuinely frightening.<br />The &quot;boogie man&quot;, Mike Myers, is a little too good at hiding, at getting from place to place, and finally at surviving being stabbed and then shot to be truly human, but in this first film it is almost always possible to give a naturalist explanation for his activities. The increasing emphasis on Myers' supernatural powers in later films may be one reason why none of the sequels are remotely as scary as this film.<br />Logic collapses in the later films. And the hack (no pun intended) sequel directors make up for their lack of invention and tension by pouring out gallons of the raspberry cordial instead. Frankly, not one of the sequels is worth your time, let alone your money.)<br />But the original is a fine, extremely well-crafted film. Other horror films, such as James Whale's _Bride of Frankenstein_, may be better films _as films_, but no other horror film is so effective _as horror_. This film is ruthlessly and effectively terrifying.<br />Cheers!<br />Laond original movie, which ironically suffers because it was so influential.

630575067X|4.0|This is an excerpt from what Kevin Smith had to say after seeing it. I agree most that if you went in with low expectations you liked it better and that the lightsaber battles were absolutely incredible.<br />&quot;Of the film, I can say many things. But the long and short of it is that I liked it - quite a bit. It starts great, ends great, and has great stuff sprinkled in between. Is there too much Jar Jar? For a small stretch, yes; but then the Binks quotient calms down considerably. Is the kid bad? I thought he was okay. He certainly wasn't wooden, as some people have suggested. He was a kid actor - no more, no less. I will say that - while it's probably unintentional, his exhuberance juxtaposes nicely against what he eventually becomes in the stories. Is it a puppet-heavy, CGI affair? There's a great deal of it, but not to the point where it's irritating (though the two-headed pod-race comentator was a bit much). <br />I think the key is to go in with low expectations. I did, and I really dug it. Dug it more with distance. I'd see it again. <br />The stuff I liked: Liam, Ewan, Darth Maul (who's in the 2:10 flick for maybe a half hour, tops), R2's introduction, the reappearance of the Tusken Raiders, the treatment of the Jedi as supreme badasses that are to be feared, the political subplot, the fact that Lucas slows the second act way down to introduce Anakin, and of course, the lightsaber battles. The use of the lightsaber in this flick is astounding; worth the price of admission alone. I'm sure in about a week, it's going to become quite fashionable to bash this flick - hard. But I'd like to go on record as saying I dug it. It's a good movie with great moments. <br />Anyway, see the flick when it comes out. It's better than half the crap out there, and it's got history on its side. <br />In a world of grades: B+ or A- <BR>In a world of stars: 3 or 3 and a 1/2&quot;

The production is better on this album than on the other two and the rapping is outstanding.

0553573403|5.0|It seems every new fantasy epic is heralded as the next Tolkein. I have always hated that reference because I find Tolken, although quite good, to be a bit comic bookish. You will get none of that in the Game of Thrones. This book has a more broad appeal than any fantasy novel I have read since Zelazney's Amber Chronicles.<br />The reason is simple. It is not your typical mages in robes, knights battling dragons, and elves, dwarves and goblins series. The book takes a more realistic look at the souls of men, and it isn't always a good view. Good guys don't wear white robes. Every character is rich and complex. Some you hate to love and some you love to hate.<br />I must admit the book had auspicious beginnings. Five family members find five wolf pups in a forest and adopt them. At the time I was thinking, &quot;Great, I am reading Lord of the Flies all over.&quot; Boy was I wrong. The story is rich and detailed, but not as confusing as Jordan's &quot;Wheel of Time.&quot; (I find it hard to remember who is who after the long layoffs).<br />The plot line is ever changing and you find yourself rooting for your favorite characters (who sometimes may just die on you). All in all, I would say if you are going to invest your time in a fantasy epic, this is definitely one to sink your teeth into. Even those with only a cursory interest in fantasy will enhoy this novel. However, if you are a sword and sorcery only fan, this may not be the book for you.
B00005NIE1|5.0|So after all the hype (and believe me over on this side of the Atlantic anyway there's been lots!!),The Strokes have finally released their debut album.I've had the c.d. for 3 weeks now and I have to say the hype is well deserved.<BR>11 tracks,36 minutes of the freshest sounds to be heard this year.Fresh only in comparison to the prog/rock or acoustic influences I've heard from many new acts this year.It isn't fresh when you consider that this music has been lifted so directly from the new wave sound that was heard in New York during the beginnings of groups such as Blondie and Telelvision.The production sounds quite crude and deliberately raw.No fancy effects what so ever-just straight guitars,bass,drums and vocals-I suppose this is what makes it sound so fresh.This c.d. is packed with an attitude last heard on the first Oasis c.d.<BR>Each song is so simple-no complicated guitar chords,no long solo's of any kind.They breeze in and out of your stereo before you know it.Yet they all have enough quality that after a couple of listens each one is very memorable.Each one has the simple structure of verse-chorus,verse-chorus.Each song is fast,to the point-they never meander around with long build ups at all.Drums establish up-tempo pattern,rhythm guitars similar to early Smiths,followed by lead guitar.The vocals of Julian Casablancas hark back to a music long considered deceased.My only fault would be that each song at first sounds so similar to each other.This is the sort of album that you'll probably like instantly or just never get into at all.Yet I'm sure perseverance would pay off for most listeners.My own favourites are the amazing 'Hard To Explain'-rumour has it that they were signed after some exec. heard half of this song.Not since New Order's 'Blue Monday'have we heard a song with such an incredible break.'New York City Cops' is a highlight also and has a very memorable chorus,but which under the current circumstances may appear to be very insensitive.'Last Night' mixes Motown rhtyhms with cutting edge rock sound.'Trying Your Luck' is as soft as it gets and almost sounds like they've become all shy and suddenly lyrically less brash lacking in the self-confidence heard in all the earlier tracks.<br /> Where they go from here it's hard to tell?But there can be no doubt that this is the sort of album that will be still talked about in 20 years time when this certain cycle of music no doubts gets repeated.
B00005NIE1|4.0|The hype for this NYC quintet is thunderous.  On their succinct debut Is This It they come close to justifying the feverish press.  The operative word here is \\"close\\".  Though called the second coming of the Velvet Underground, Television, Talking Heads, Gang of 4, etc., they haven't yet subsumed these influences into an individual style.  Yet.  They will, no doubt.  For now, here are 11 songs that rock you from every angle, reminiscent of Hoboken's great lamented The Feelies (another second-coming-of-Velvet Underground band) with more propulsion and less to say.

B00005NMVP|3.0|It's increasingly fashionable to 'remaster' CDs; with some justification, as the technology has advanced in the years since albums like YOTC were first released digitally.<BR>Personally, my ears aren't finely tuned enough to feel major benefit from this re-release, and my ancient sound system made no comment, so I have had to concentrate on the 'bonus tracks'<br />On the Border (live) is taken from the Chicago Radio sessions; it's a fine version, but technically hardly an advertisement for digital remastering. More seriously, those sessions included a ten-minute Year of the Cat, with a four minute keyboard intro, and marvellous sax solo - why isn't that one here?<br />Belsize Blues owes its presence here to its absence from other 'official' releases, though this version was first released on the unofficial Coldest Winter in Memory collection. The date suggests it could have been a rejected track from the original YOTC - though the flavour is five years earlier. The sleeve notes leave us none the wiser.<br />Story of the Songs is a commentary on the YOTC album by Al stewart; interesting, but hardly the sort of thing you'd listen to daily on your in-car stereo. Many of the concert albums include highly original and amusing intros, especially to YOTC itself; wouldn't the fictional explanations have been a better addition than a recorded sleeve note?<br />This remastered album will have nothing to say to new listeners, so it is clearly intended to persuade existing fans to part with their money. The die-hards will - as I did - and I don't regret it. But, by gum, I'd have been much, much happier spending a few dollars more on a proper job.<br />Picture it - a twin-cd set with the remastered YOTC on one disc, and the other featuring these bonus tracks, plus a selection of other live versions, complete with intro, guest artists - one YOTC even featured a guest singer - and a sleeve note that truly informed us about the collection, not just looked back to 1976.

1573228214|4.0|I would give this book five stars except for three things: first, the book is slow in the beginning, second, I don't think that Hornby says anything particularly original or goes as deep as he could have in terms of the analysis of men in the nineties and the whole male-female relationships, and third, the music as metaphor for life thing didn't work as well for me as it might have for others because like Laura I hadn't heard of half the musicians mentioned.<br />That said, overall I liked the novel. I loved that the chapters were short, so if I didn't have time to sit and read for a long period, I could still read some (I'm one of those people who doesn't like to leave a book part way through a chapter). Even though I'm a woman I could relate to Rob; my obsession is books and movies. Rob is a commitmentphobic man who keeps messing up his relationship because he's afraid to grow up. He thinks he's going to miss something if he doesn't keep his options open, so he ends at 36 with nothing much to show for his life. I found myself wanting to strangle Rob, yet liking him in spite of myself, probably because I know so many guys - and women, actually - like him. The book doesn't have alot of amazing new insights, but the characters are fun, the pace is great, and there is so much I could relate to, even as a woman. I laughed and cried and wanted to scream at Rob at times. Must also say I hated the movie - in the movie I didn't buy the Rob/Laura reconciliation, but in the book it makes more sense. I reccommend this book to anyone in their 20s or 30s who are trying to figure out what it's all about, to music fans, and anyone who loves a good laugh.

6305278016|4.0|Ok, some may think this is a fine example of late 80's cheesy action fare. However, the acting is incredible, the characters are complex, and the motivations are unique. This is not a black and white good vs. evil movie. Which gray area do you agree with? If you've never seen this movie, stick with it until the last half hour...
6304711875|3.0|Scream is an original horror film intelligently spoofing the horror film genre. All its characters (for as long as they remain alive) are likeable, believable, and there is enough deception and suspense to make you wonder almost until the end who the real killer is. Neve Campbell is good in her role as Sydney Prescott, the grief-stricken daughter of a woman who had been murdered. The murderer is supposedly behind bars. Then various people in Sydney's school fall victim to murder, all of the victims hitting closer and closer to home all the time. Sydney also receives threatening phone calls. All of the events escalate as Courteney Cox, who plays tabloid tv reporter Gail Weathers (Sydney abhors her for her coverage of her mother's murder and the exploitative book she published when the case ended), enters the scene and begins covering the string of murders and Sydney's apparent connection to them. While the film can almost be genuinely scary at times, it is also filled with semi-sly humour poking fun of the horror film genre. Great movie for entertainment value, definitely worthwhile.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Wow...that's all I can say after listening to &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; by Nickelback. One of the better newer albums to come out in 2001, these guys really put their heart and soul into all 10 tracks on this release. Songs like &quot;Never Again&quot; will put you in the shoes of a child who has an alcholic &amp; abusive father figure. The whole album is great, but my personal favorite tracks are &quot;Never Again&quot;, &quot;How you remind me&quot;, &quot;Woke up this morning&quot;, &quot;Hangnail&quot; &amp; &quot;Good times gone&quot;.
1558908498|2.0|Some films, sequels particularly, can be overdone. The sequel to Scream is not really bad, but it is not really great either. It does not equal the originality of its predecessor nor does it really provide the same sense of urgency of the first film. In addition, the characters are not quite as interesting this time. When an original premise is overworked, we are left with what could be considered cinematic leftovers, so to speak. Meatloaf, anyone? The only really interesting parts here are the over the top performance of Laurie Metcalf and also the performance of Liev Schreiber.
6305126062|2.0|Considered solely on its merits as a film, this thing borders on the pathetic. The one redeeming feature is the horse's performance and the cameraman who captured it for us. That horse really worked for his hay. Watching Pilgrim reminds us of Lee Marvin's comment on receiving an Academy Award for Cat Ballou: \\"this really belongs to a horse somewhere in Nevada\\". While this is supposed to be a story about people, Redford as director couldn't avoid the clich&eacute; of scenes of sweeping vistas, pleasing to watch but contributing nothing to an already thin plot. This isn't a film about frontier development, it's supposed to be about a horse shrink confronted by an Eastern \\"modern woman.\\" Why couldn't Redford provide some urban shots for contrast?<br /><br />We must be fair to Robert Redford. Converting the worst novel of the past generation to film took courage and talent. Redford has these aplenty, but the source material inevitably undercut even his abilities. Evans' unique version of a Harlequin Romance was designed for the screen - simplistic, implausible and meritless. The only thing positive here is that Redford translated Evans' characters into film without a hitch. Easily done since the only one with any depth is [again] the horse. Redford simply plays himself in the role Tom Booker. His opening scenes are nearly all mute, but Redford can pull that off with his piercing gaze. He personifies the laconic solitary rancher with ease. Regrettably, Evans' story forces Booker to fall for Anne MacLean, a woman with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever. Neither book nor film provided a shred of motive for this bizarre romance, we are simply presented the situation in text and scene as if perfectly natural. Thomas, as MacLean, conveys the self-centred, amoral and predatory publishing executive almost flawlessly. She blithely enters the affair with no shred of conscience for her betrayed husband, Sam Neill. What is the motivation for this marital treason? Sam couldn't do his job from Montana? We never find out just what made MacLean attractive to Booker. As it turns out, that isn't important.<br /><br />We come at last to the one who's supposed to be the important character, Grace, the teen-age amputee. Evans was careful not to burden the horse with manic-depressive tendencies resulting from Grace MacLean's crippling. We're left to think that being smacked by a semi was cause enough. In the event, even her handicap loses its importance. Grace has a more crippling situation to deal with, a mother whose behaviour would make a spider blush. Evans, of course, fit the story into 20th Century social norms by having Grace ultimately accept her father's cuckolding. The film reprises this seditious scenario, leaving Sam Neill the modern hapless male. [One wonders when he's going to break the weak reed parts he's been saddled with.] Annie MacLean wants the western hunk, she snares him and that's justification enough. It also turns out to be the single point of both book and film. Not much substance, but Redford didn't have much to work with.m Montana? We never find out just what made MacLean attractive to Booker.

6300214710|3.0|Some interesting characters appear in this film based around the traditional American movie standby, the High School Prom. Who is taking whom, what will they wear, who loves whom, and who is whose true friend. This is about a group of teenagers, specifically one girl and her attempts to cop off with a rich boy. The insight into the American 'class system' will enlighten British viewers as there are closer comparisons with our own class system than might at first be obvious, although the American system seems to be based on money rather than anything else. Having said that, the 'can love exist between people from such different backgrounds' plot was hackneyed after Shakespeare did it with Romeo And Juliet, so by the time we get to 1984 we don't really care whether she gets him or the other guy. This is entertaining, yet examines the relationships of young-adulthood with a subtle intelligence. The sets, costumes, and music are very clever in that they evoke the 1950s whereas they firmly pinpoint the movie in the 1980s. Ringwald shows here that you don't need to be conventionally attractive to be a star
6303022901|5.0|This movie was incredible. Even though there are many stories and characters to follow, I didn't feel overwhelmed by them. <br />Whether you are a man or a woman, you will identifiy with a least  one of the chareacters. It helps us to realize that our parents, whether intentional or not, can harm their children's emotionl development by their actions.<br />Grown children and their parents need to watch this movie together and discuss the events and how it parallels their lives.<br />Bring the tissue. This movie is very moving and emotionally charged. I will definitely read the book, which will no dought be better.
630018403X|4.0|This is John Hughes's masterpiece. It starts by making you think you are watching a typical high school screwball comedy with a crusty old dean and a janitor, then draws you into an intelligent five-handed set piece that would not look out of place on the West End stage. Emilio Estevez distinguishes himself as a fine actor, no just a pretty face, and Molly Ringwald performs well as Hughes's alter ego, the everyman character that pervades his 1980s films. There's some funny bits, some serious bits, a couple of sad bits, and a wonderful central set taking the shape of a huge library designed, not for keeping or reading books in, but to be a stage for this play to be performed in. The supporting players all turn in good performances, and the music is pleasantly diverting when it's needed.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have a few albums that I'm able to just put in my car and keep there for several weeks of driving without ever getting old.  Even without my favorite John Mayer song (Comfortable) this album is still awesome.  Every song jumps out as an honest testament to life and love.  &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; especially cannot be missed.  I can't say enough how much everyone needs to experience this album!  I'm so glad to have caught John Mayer on his rise to being a household name!
B00003CXRP|4.0|Certain guarantees of quality are implied by Tom Hanks' presence in a movie. You also know that it will be a little bit different, and that the lead character will be likeable. This film starts with Hanks' character being very dislikeable, but he gradually mellows throughout the film, and you find yourself warming to him. It is what I would call a 'What-if' film. You are thinking throughout the film 'would I propose marriage to this lady? Would I open the packages that weren't addressed to me? Would I try to kill myself? Would I marry someone else if my spouse was missing, presumed dead? Ultimately the film satisfies. Tom Hanks may not make the same choices that we would make, but you are with him all the way as he makes those choices.<br />The scenery is beautiful too.

6303460151|2.0|Whilst Prêt A Porter might be taken as a sly dig at the Paris fashion industry, its appeal is probably limited to those it satirises, that is the designers, models, buyers, journalists, and other hangers-on.<br />Someone close to the world of these famous designers with their peculiar costumes and logos might get every one of the jokes, references, and even know that some of the real-life people the characters are based on.<br />The problem is that this world is an exclusive one. Whilst This Is Spinal Tap and The Blues Brothers satirised an industry and an art form known to many, the Paris fashion scene is available only a select few. For an object lesson in how to spoof the fashion business without alienating the general public, see Absolutely Fabulous.<br />The impressive roster of actors in the film (Sophia Loren, Lauren Bacall, Richard Grant, and Julia Roberts to name but four) and the directorial talents of Robert Altman are really wasted on a movie that is of such limited appeal.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is the perfect example of how the Academy can sometimes overlook great films.  Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances as the young go-get-'em cop, while Morgan Freeman adds to his list of amazing performances as a disturbed, retiring, New York cop.  This movie focuses most of its attention on character development (rare in today's Hollywood), and the whole movie keeps building and building to the ending scene.  It seems as though the screenplay will not be able to deliver an ending worthy of all the build-up but it does just that.<br />This movie is a must-see and will be a classic in a few years (if it isn't already).
078322804X|5.0|There are seven golden rules of cinema, and this film breaks all of them.<br />1. Don't give a fat guy the lead<br />2. Don't devote 90% of the budget to the car chase<br />3. Musicals made after 1960 don't work<br />4. Adaptations from television make bad movies<br />5. Don't have more than two or three guest stars<br />6. Mysoginy isn't funny<br />7. Nazis aren't funny<br />So we should be grateful that Dan Ayckroyd and John Landis took up the challenge and made a film that crossed all of those boundaries. Belushi exudes charm and cool at the same time, while John Candy is an excellent good/bad guy (the distinctions become blurred!). The music is what makes the film truly great. I am sure you don't need me to list the guest turns, but it is remarkable that Cab Calloway, who had been appearing in The Cotton Club in the 1920s turns in the definitive performance of Minnie The Moocher at the age of 72. The other big star of the film is the dead-pan delivery of lines, with Ayckroyd and Belushi in particular excelling.

B00005QCVT|4.0|Requiem for a Dream is the story of the drug induced transformations of junkie turned dealer, Harry Goldfarb, his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly), best friend (Marlon Wayans), and mother (Ellen Burstyn).  This is a bleak and quite unpleasant film; still there is much to recommend it: good directing, camera work, special effects, editing and acting--particularly Burstyn in the role of Sara Goldfarb, whose addiction to television leads to something stronger.  Burstyn's slow metamorphosis of the meek Sarah into a blithering psychotic is just a masterpiece of acting.  Jennifer Connelly shows she's not on the silver screen just for her looks and handles a complicated role as the degenerating junkie girlfriend with real style and color.  Leto and Wayans turn in memorable performances too as best friends turned failed drug dealers looking for one more good score to put them back in business.  The fault with this movie is that it is virtually a manifesto of nihilism; compounded by a lackluster script and a tendency for certain scenes to run on too long. This said, I still think writer/director Darren Aronofsky should be applauded for an imaginative and unflinching treatment of an ugly subject.
B00000JCRH|5.0|To make such a statement as I did in the headline shows how much I love this album.  This is the high point of heavy metal.  8 incredibly hard and incredible songs.  Metallica took the best that each of it's members had to offer and put it together to create a masterpiece.<br />Not only is the music incredible, the lyrics are deep and meaningful.  Master Of Puppets tells of drug addiction while Welcome Home discusses life of an inmate at the sanitarium, and Disposible Heroes tells the story of a soldier at war.  This album is one of the most lyrically genius works of all of metal.<br />From the opening riffs of Battery to the last pounding note of Damage Inc., this album is nearly an hour of heart-pounding heavy metal.  If you don't have this album, you don't understand what heavy metal really can be.
0790731479|5.0|Just to warn you. when in trying to trick you in the widescreen format, the company made a mistake by also including the full screen version with it.  i compared the widescreen and the full screen. and the full screen seems to comtain more picture at the top and bottom.  which must mean, that all they did was take the full screen version, cut off the top a bottom slightly and call it widescreen.  which is strange because i would expect it to be easier just to make the theatrical version than to carefully edit the full screen and rip many people off.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is one of the most insane and brutal albums ever created.  Slipknot did not disappoint by destroying their previous cd in terms of quality and absolute chaos.  The Heretic Anthem might end up becoming to this decade what Pantera's &quot;Walk&quot; was to the 90s.  The Shape shows that Slipknot is a very talented band.  Just awesome.  If you ever get a chance to see this band, don't pass it up.  They are one of the best live acts ever.
0812550706|3.0|In case this is the first review you encounter, here is a brief summary: Ender is one of many children specially bred and selected for a special school that trains superb tacticians.  Of the school's hundreds of students he is the brightest.  The story reflects his struggles with the school's harsh learning conditions, the interactions with admiring and envious peers, and his anguish at knowing his strategic skills will one day be used to attempt to genocide an alien race of invaders.  The characters are very believable and the storyline is engrossing.<BR>     Unfortunately, my criticisms require SPOILING the story.  If you intend to read the book, don't go any further.  <br />I have two criticisms of the story elements.  First, I found it difficult to accept that all of Ender's brilliant tactics had never been tried before.  Surely an eighty-year school with hundreds of specially raised geniuses would have produced a great number of students able to innovate.  I'm certain I could never have devised all of Ender's battle tactics on my own, but I may have been able to invent one or two.  I refuse to believe that none of the other students had similar ideas.<BR>Second, the use of a queen creature as the ultimate leader and secret weakness of the enemy is a weak plot element.  There is a multitude of shows, books, and games that use this idea: the enemy force as a whole is super powerful, except for one central command creature/computer/ship.  Destroy that, and you win.  This done-to-death plot technique really disappointed me.  <br />If I could, I would give it 3.5 stars

B00005J6UP|5.0|Watching THE GOONIES again today, sixteen years after its initial release, I realize it's not the greatest movie ever made.  The dialogue is sometimes goofy, the jokes are corny, the set pieces are occasionally a little simplistic (come on -- the piano scene?  The waterslide?!?!).  But still, I love THE GOONIES.  I love it!  And as easy as it is to see its flaws, it's even easier to see why it's so much fun...<br />- The actors.  The cast is enormously appealing, from the incomparable Martha Plimpton to the sweet Kerri Green to the adorably self-deprecating Jeff B. Cohen.  Even Corey Haim -- oops, I mean Feldman -- does a great job.  Plus, Anne Ramsey, Jon Matuszak and on and on and on.  Not a weak link in the whole cast.  <br />- The premise.  GOONIES is perfect escapist fun for kids.  While it's clearly not in the same league as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it tries to be the same kind of stunt-filled adventure movie for a younger audience.  It's great fun for kids, because in this movie, a group of adolescents get to save the day.<br />And mostly...<br />- This package.  Clearly a lot of care and love went into making this DVD.  When the entire cast (plus the director) of any film can be reassembled after sixteen years, you know everyone involved has a great fondness in their hearts for the project.  And that fondness is evident on screen.  This DVD has TONS of extras, including one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard (and, in this case, seen!) and some fun outtakes.<br />If you're at all a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  And, if the internet rumors are to be believed, there's the possibility of a sequel sometime in the future.  What better way to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight GOONIES 2 than to scoop up a copy of this DVD ASAP?  The better this sells, the better our chance of getting more GOONIES.  And I for one, can't wait!

0312287550|5.0|My discovery of The River God was a gift of delightful serendipity. I had just met my nephew's future father-in-law. He was quite interested in a recent trip my wife and I had made to Israel and Egypt. My view of Egypt had been shaped largely by the Biblical narrative (the Egyptians are the bad guys in the Hebrew story) and by popular culture (mummies will come to life and kill you). Visiting the country began to open my eyes to the enormity of the accomplishments of ancient Egypt. The civilization lasted for three millennia, three times as long as Rome. The Egyptian preoccupation with funerary arrangements reflected less a preoccupation with death than a deeply-held religious sentiment that this world is nothing in comparison with eternity. Wilbur Smith is in love with Africa. His appreciation for Egyptian civilization, warts and all, is apparent. Under his skilled hand, that civilization comes to life in a way that will keep the reader turning pages. Never mind that much of it is fiction: Smith's pharaohs and queen never existed. Neither did Taita, his narrator. But Smith makes us BELIEVE that they did, so much so that when we read the postscript, describing his deciphering of an ancient manuscript by Taita, we aren't surprised. Now ancient Egyptians are no longer paintings on tomb walls; they are real people, capable of love and cruelty, hope and hate. Their full humanity shines through on every page. The emasculated Taita rises above his affliction to become a brilliant artist, engineer, and physician; still, he rejoices in the humiliation and death of Rasfer, who did the deed years before. The beautiful Lostris becomes queen against her will, as pharaoh believes her to be the only woman who can bear him a son. Though she rises to the occasion in ways that make the people love her, she conceals from the aging king the fact that the children he believes to be his heirs are really the result of an ongoing affair with her first love, Tanus. Smith's narrative makesit clear that, had he the anatomical equipment, Taita would have been Tanus' rival. <br />The humanity of the characters is reflected in the humanity of the nation. Egypt is rent by internal dissension, with a shadow king in the north rivaling pharaoh for control of the land. Corruption reigns among the viziers of the nomes, or provinces, of Egypt, the worst being at the hands of Taita's master. Egypt is complacent and unprepared for an assault by Hyksos charioteers; the wheel had been unknown in the land of Egypt. Ultimately, the country pays a terrible price. Through it all, Taita and his companions on a geographical and spiritual journey retain faith and hope.  We care about what happens to them, in this book and in its sequel.
0679879269|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Philip Pullman's 'Golden Compass' and 'Subtle Knife'.  I was just as equally disappointed with 'Amber Spyglass', where Pullman's strong distaste for religion, especially Christianity, gets in the way of his narrative.<br />First and foremost, the final battle with the Authority, which Pullman has been steadily building toward during his last two novels, never materializes, a victim of Pullman's bigoted views of all who believe in a Supreme Being.  The Authority's #2 man is more reminiscent of Barney Fife than Beelzebub, and is easily sidetracked by the inexplicably repentant Ms. Coulter.  One begins to wonder just how the Authority and his sidekick put together this revolution that everybody else seems to be so in awe of.  And, of course, the terribly, terribly hateful beings that guard the gates of Hell suddenly become nice because Lyra is nice to them... ugh.  <br />The story is saved (and only to a point) through Pullman's imagination which, despite his theology, manages to envision other universes (allegories of the Many Worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics) in which evolution takes different turns, and the 'Dust' that binds them all to a similar fate.  <br />For those parents who do believe in Christianity, be warned: daemons are merely a manifestation of what New Age teachers might call &quot;Spirit Guides&quot;, and Pullman offers a nice little exercise your kids can engage in to find theirs.   <br />It is clear that Pullman fancies his tale on the level of Milton's 'Paradise Lost', and, through the second book, I think he might have given old John M. a run for his money.  But his last book draws back the curtain -- way too far -- on his core beliefs, and they are not complimentary at all.  You're all victims of a sad mistake, says Pullman.  My only sad mistake was that I finished what started out to be a very well written trilogy.
0553573403|5.0|This series is dark, beautiful, tragic, and thrilling.  It is the best fantasy series I've read since Lord of the Rings.  I literally couldn't put it down and now that I've finished \\"A Sword of Storms\\" I'm having withdrawal pains.  I hope Mr. Martin can finish the next installment ASAP!  I want it now!  Be warned though, this series is not about happy-endings and justice done; the characters and plots are brutally realistic and often a character you've come to love meets a tragic end or loses a limb or is utterly disgraced.  It's also not about flashy magic and stereotypical fantasy schtick.  It's a realistic medieval world with a hint of magic and an amazingly rich backstory.  A must read.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Watching THE GOONIES again today, sixteen years after its initial release, I realize it's not the greatest movie ever made.  The dialogue is sometimes goofy, the jokes are corny, the set pieces are occasionally a little simplistic (come on -- the piano scene?  The waterslide?!?!).  But still, I love THE GOONIES.  I love it!  And as easy as it is to see its flaws, it's even easier to see why it's so much fun...<br />- The actors.  The cast is enormously appealing, from the incomparable Martha Plimpton to the sweet Kerri Green to the adorably self-deprecating Jeff B. Cohen.  Even Corey Haim -- oops, I mean Feldman -- does a great job.  Plus, Anne Ramsey, Jon Matuszak and on and on and on.  Not a weak link in the whole cast.  <br />- The premise.  GOONIES is perfect escapist fun for kids.  While it's clearly not in the same league as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it tries to be the same kind of stunt-filled adventure movie for a younger audience.  It's great fun for kids, because in this movie, a group of adolescents get to save the day.<br />And mostly...<br />- This package.  Clearly a lot of care and love went into making this DVD.  When the entire cast (plus the director) of any film can be reassembled after sixteen years, you know everyone involved has a great fondness in their hearts for the project.  And that fondness is evident on screen.  This DVD has TONS of extras, including one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard (and, in this case, seen!) and some fun outtakes.<br />If you're at all a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  And, if the internet rumors are to be believed, there's the possibility of a sequel sometime in the future.  What better way to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight GOONIES 2 than to scoop up a copy of this DVD ASAP?  The better this sells, the better our chance of getting more GOONIES.  And I for one, can't wait!
0688002307|5.0|As Prisig himself says, &quot;the real cycle you're working on is a cycle called 'yourself'.&quot;, &quot;Astronomers would be telling mankind that if it looked long enough through a telescope powerful enough, what it would see was the back of it's own head.&quot;  I feel like I'm back in school and have just finished a very intensive philosophy class, but theres no grade, no pass or fail, and the University is in your mind.  If I've learned anything from this book it is that &quot;Quility&quot; is &quot;Reality&quot;.  &quot;'Quality' is the parent, the source of all subjects and objects.  &quot;Any intellectually conceived object is always in the past and therefore unreal.  Reality is always the moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place.  There is no other reality.&quot;  &quot;Religion isn't invented by man.  Men are invented by religion.  Men invent responses to Quality, and amoung these responses is an understanding of what they themselves are.&quot;  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  It forced me to think and look at the world in a new perspective.
B00005BCK6|5.0|A Piece of the Action was always one of my favorite episodes.  Until you see these on DVD, you don't realize how much got cut out in order to cram in more commercials.  These are actually well-thought out masterpieces of television history that didn't deserve to be hacked to pieces like that.  <br />William Shatner did a superlative acting job here, as did guest star Vic Taybeck.  <br />By Any Other Name was almost as good.  My favorite scene is where Scotty gets the one Kelvan drunk, takes his &quot;turn people into styrofoam blocks&quot; doohickey, and passes out cold in the doorway of his quarters.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Nickelback's 4th cd (Hesher, Curb, The State, Silver Side Up--4, not 2. Just because their earlier cds weren't released in the US doesn't mean they don't exist) comes off as a rather mediocre rehash of their older material. No new ground is broken, and instead they move backwards. The song Just For is the best example. The original version (Just Four) which appeared on Curb is so much better that it is hard to describe. The emotion of the song is gone and it now comes off extremely flat. The single How You Remind Me [sounds like] Finger Eleven's Drag You Down. All in all, quite the disappointing cd. Not awful, but nowhere near as good as their old stuff. If you want Nickelback, pick up the State and try to get a copy of Curb. Silver Side Up isn't worth the money.
B00005K9LM|2.0|Ill stick to my old CD from this album than to the remastered version. What a dissapointment.. After so much publicity before releasing them, weve got almost the same thing, with bad extra tracks and no great insight in the booklet.
1558216847|5.0|Slavomir Rawicz's story of his World War II-era journey, first by cattle car and by foot to Siberia, then by foot from Siberia to India, puts to shame any notion that almost any experience in the Western world is difficult. To us, hard reality is forgetting to bring bottled water on a camping trip, or burning a souffle, or being stuck in traffic when picking up our kids. To Rawicz and his fellow escapees from a labor camp, hard reality included walking through driving snow wearing little more than sacks, walking through a desert for days on end without water or food, chasing snakes for food, climbing the Himilayas without any equipment or guides, drinking polluted water, and living in your own filth in a chimney-sized cell for a year. Rawicz's story is magical for the armchair adventurer, though it must have been unbearably brutal for those who lived it.<br />Ghostwritten by a British journalist, THE LONG WALK at times reads as if an Englishman experienced the journey, though this only adds to its charm.<br />I commend the Lyons Press for reviving this book, which I would not otherwise have found. Check out the other titles they've rereleased, especially David Howarth's THE SLEDGE PATROL, WE DIE ALONE, and THE SHETLAND BUS.
B000002I99|5.0|This is one of the most creepy albums that I have ever heard but I love it.  The song Steven sends chills down my spine every time that I hear it.  It is truly a masterpiece and in my opinion way better then lots of alice coopers new stuff.  I do like his new stuff just not as much as the old.  This album truly reminds me of a bad dream.  Another great cooper album you might want to check out is Alice goes to Hell.  It is another of coopers creepy albums that has songs on it that will stick in your mind for days.  Go out and buy Welcome to My Nightmare.
B000001EQT|4.0|I can't believe that in all of these positive reviews of this great album, no one mentioned the stellar background vocals of former Turtles Flo and Eddie.  To me, that's what sets &quot;the Slider&quot; apart from the rest of T-Rex's slightly above average glam-rock. I have to believe they also had some influence on the overall sound, not to belittle the songwriting talents of Marc Bolan or the super seventies overproduction of Tony Visconti.  Overall, a great album, I would have given four and a half stars if I could.

1573225517|4.0|For those of us in our 30s, it is an often trying period if you find yourself not married and/or not without a family of your own.  Contemporary literature and the movies have certainly given audiences plenty of tales of women during this time of alleged life &quot;crisis.&quot;  Thankfully, we have Nick Hornby's &quot;High Fidelity&quot; to give us some rare insight into a man's mind.  While reading this novel, one can not help think that *any* guy reading this book could not help but have a smile of recognition come across his face.  Through the eyes of record store owner Rob Fleming, readers get a comic look at how one man deals with life, love, and relationships when his long-time live-in girlfriend, Laura, leaves him for another man. <br />Some readers will be frustrated that Rob seems to be not nearly as passionate towards his girlfriend as he is with music and his record shop.  But again, this is arguably an undeniable male trait (and I am sure infuriating, in the eyes of many women) when it comes to relationships.  Rob's music and record shop could easily be substituted for sports or cars for another guy.   I am not sure if Rob makes the &quot;right&quot; relationship issue in the end, but as with all good literature, it is a good sign when an author engages us in such an internal debate.  A warning to those who may have seen or are familiar with the movie version starring John Cusack, Hollywood moved the novel's locale from London to Chicago.  The book definitely has British wit and slang.  Nevertheless, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is an enjoyable read that both sexes should enjoy.
B000002JPA|4.0|I am a big fan of heavy metal so when I heard about a metal band that used lots of keyboard I thought that they would suck.  But after I got this album I saw that keyboards work.  The album is great and since I have gotten this album I have become a big fan of DT.  <BR>Anyone that is thinking of getting this album should just run out and get it.  You wont be sorry.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Lots of people seem to really hate this movie. Understandable. I dont. Admittadely this is not one of John Woo's better efforts in the action genre. Face/off and Hardboiled are much better. That said this is still a good film with more good points then bad. Tom Cruise is a good actor and perfect for the role. Thandie Newtown is stunning and provides great eye candy for the movie. And of course there is the great Mr. Woo. His camera work on this film is amazing and the movie as a whole looks great. All the cool trademarks are here like doves, motorcycles, trenchcoats, sunglasses, two guns etc. The fire-walk was quite cool. The actions scenes are very Woo-esque though toned down to meet the Pg-13 rating. The score is excellent and will get your adrenaline going. Now for the films bad points. Sometimes Woo indulges himself a bit too much. The whole carchase thing was a bit rediculous but otherwise his trademarks in the film i.e. Trenchcoats and sunglasses, slow-mo, explosions, doves etc. are quite enjoyable even though the fight scenes could use some speeding up they are good enough. Dougray Scott is not a good bad guy for the film. Woo's 3 other American films (Face/off, Broken Arrow, Hard Target) all had awesome bad guys but Dougray just does not cut it. However he provides some unintentional laughter with his funny Scottish accent. That being said he is not all that bad just not good when compared to other Woo baddies. The pg-13 rating is the films main bad point. It forces Woo,to tone himself down and reduce his vision. There should have been more action in this movie. Despite all these bad points the movie is still cool and gets better upon repeat viewings. Rent it to see what u think.
B00005LB9O|5.0|This is an album you will love the 1st time around. And as you listen to it more, you like it even more. Travis has quickly become one of my favorite bands and they scored on this album. Travis' traditional acoustics are heard in every song and like &quot;The Man Who&quot;, the songs are meaningful and captivating. You find yourself singing along rather quickly.
B00005NW02|5.0|This is the best cd i have ever heard. All the songs on this cd are amazing. They range from the lyrics making absolutely no sense (Jet Pilot) to being on of the most emotional songs i have ever heard (Chop Suey!). Serj Tankian has the weirdest voice but it fits perfectly with their music. If I compared these guys to my other favorite bands; Slipknot, Soulfly, Slayer, Mudvayne, and Korn, these guys are the most tolerable. Stand out tracks (in my opinion) are; Prison Song, Needles, Deer Dance, Jet Pilot, X, Chop Suey!, Bounce, ATWA, Shimmy, Toxicity, and Psycho.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the landmark album of the 20th century for its originality and influence over everything that followed it. No other musical work has so managed to transform its genre like this one--think of American cinema after Citizen Kane, or painting after Picasso. Almost larger than life, this album transformed rock into high art, and it even impacted the culture of the time in music, fashion and thought. This was the first rock album to include its lyrics, signifying that the Beatles considered them important enough to print. If you don't own this CD, you owe it to yourself to purchase it. Even if you're not a Beatles fan, no music fan should be without this CD--it would be the equivalent of an aficionado of  plays to ignore Shakespeare's Hamlet or King Lear. Interestingly, the Beatles treat this album as a type of play, as they impersonate a group called &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and use all sorts of special effects in the first two songs to give the listener the impression that they are listening in on one of their &quot;concerts&quot;. One tune melts into another, which is another first. Sounds never before heard are utilized, there is rich instrumentation and variety of music, and there is absolutely no &quot;filler&quot;. Each tune is important to this concept album, which builds in intensity to the final tune. Themes include loneliness, anxiety of growing old, escapism, inability to communicate with words, and all of it culminating in the absolutely haunting and brilliant Day in the Life. While much of the music has a certain cheerfulness about it, make no mistake that just beneath the surface this is a very dark world that the Beatles portray. Perhaps this album won't sound as revolutionary as it did back in 1967, but it is by no means dated. It is a true classic that only gets better with age and repeated listenings.
0792156684|5.0|The attack on America stunned everyone. People died in carnage and we pray for them all. <BR>     The same events--not necessarily in the same way, happened with Titanic. The iceberg hit, people didnt know what to think. They were stunned to find out that they're going to die. They panicked--much like those in the news coverage on the WTC collapsing, people were running for safety.<BR>     James Cameron captured these events with just the right measure to stun his audience when they took place. The iceberg collision for example; we knew it was coming, the characters in the movie didn't. Yet, Cameron amazingly causes us to be surprised to see it and enthralls us to want the collision not to happen. Just for that emotional effect, we should applaud this film.<BR>     Cameron took measures to make every inch of the ship itself perfect in detail. He put up his share of the profits, namely: his pay check to get the movie made. It came out on December 19th after a grueling period of re-editing the film. Audiences were glued to the screen. My first screening had an united response of shock and amazement.<BR>     No one had seen a film quite like it. There was that beauty we admire today in Technicolor movies, yet it was filmed in another forum. It had a grand scope, using digital imagry (flawless) with real life scale models and setpieces. They've made attempts to duplicate that since, but no film has yet to capture Titanic's huge and awe-inspiring canvass. <BR>     The events and every other part of this modern-day classic epic resemble the tragedies in our recent history. Look at this film, mourn the people in the film and real life as if you knew them. Cameron introduced us to his characters, and we began to like them. They're people who are either made-up characters or real featured in a film--sure, I'm not dillusional. But some of us didn't know anything about the people who died in the WTC that horrible morning, but we grieve and pray for them. So when seeing Titanicfor the 1rst time or the twentieth, think of the horrors, the mourning and tragedy people must have felt with that awful situation.<br />     Titanic may just be another blockbuster picture that made too much money to some people. To me and a lot of others, it may well be the greatest disaster film. If not, the most impactful. Buy it or rent Titanic--no matter what, you must experience this monumental achievement at least once.
B000022TSV|5.0|Julia Mengas-Johnson is a sensation.  The opera shown as a motion picture.  Her portrail of Carmen is flawless!  She brings Carmen to life on the screen.  With the voice of an angel.  I recommend the movie.
B000000WG4|4.0|Although Oldfields' lp did break some new ground back then, it was only a taste of what was out there. His works have been inspiring during those 'late-night' sessions when gathered with a few friends, discussing many, many subjects...(along with Tangerine Dream).<br />I've seen the 'Tubular Bells' and 'Ommadawn' CDs available, however, i'm wondering if anyone remembers Oldfields' other release 'Hergest Ridge'? It was released between the aforementioned works - 1974 i believe (my vinyl is somewhere in storage). <br />Does it exist on CD? For me, it's a close tie between 'Hergest Ridge' and 'Ommadawn'.
0792106989|1.0|Overall, &quot;The man who shot Liberty Valance&quot; is a disappointing film - especially when you consider the vast array of stars that are in it. Compared with other westerns that John Wayne and James Stewart starred in, this is way below par. The story is ragged, the action is minimal and the excitement is low. This is not as good as it is supposed to be.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I just watched this movie 10 minutes ago, and it still keeps on revolving in mind, which it will do for a long, long time. Probably one of the best movies since Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction...a must see for anyone looking for a break from all the crap that's out there...
B000002HPT|5.0|While less progressive than Dream Theater's other albums, &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; is a powerful album with solid songs that will get stuck in your head for hours. The whole album goes through cycles of touching ballads and aggressive tracks. Throughout the whole thing, the music is wonderfully written except for a simplistic guitar part on track 2 &quot;You Not Me.&quot; Its still an awesome song, I just wonder if John Petrucci gets bored playing it.<BR>The whole album is a journey through varying colors and images, steeping your mind in a broad spectrum of emotions. While the band is often uplifting, you will feel like crying when the lyrics finally HIT you (especially on the touching &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot;). Other times, the songs will cause you to drive 95mph on the freeway if you are not paying attention.<BR>In Conclusion:<BR>Many fans find that this album is not progressive enough for their tastes, and it is true that this album is far less progressive than their other trappings. But this album, while less progressive, is still a magnum opus of an album. If you only love Progressive music and you can't stand anything that isn't written in 11/8, then you might want to listen to clips of this album before you buy it. But if you like Dream Theater, and you generally just love good music, then buy this incredible album.
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles decided to stop touring and concentrate on making better albums, which to me was a brilliant career move. It did end up creating frictions between the foursome, but that's another story. The end result was that they created albums that set the stage for rock and pop music for decades to come.<br />Revolver, the Beatles' seventh album in three years, was the first offering from the studio-bound Beatles, and it's a hit, a palpable hit!<br />The centerpiece of this album is \\"Yellow Submarine\\", probably the best song Ringo has sung. It's a song that one will either love so much or hate note for note. That song of course spawned a movie, with \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and a snatch from \\"Love You To\\" ending up there.<br />\\"Love You To\\" is a wonderous exercise in sitar music. This instead of making a mere guest appearance in Rubber Soul's \\"Norwegian Wood\\". Here, the sitar is the star here, (wordplay intended) along with George's ethereal vocals lending a weird spirituality in the song. It's one of the tunes I look forward to whenever it ends up in my CD player.<br />This album is also noteworthy for Paul's three lovely ballads, all of which he ended up playing in Give My Regards To Broadstreet. They are \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\", and \\"For No One.\\" The first is the well-heard story of a lonely spinster intercut with that of Father MacKenzie. \\"All the lonely people, where do they all come from?\\" From all walks of life, I imagine. \\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\" is a sweet gentle song, with each of the two verses beginning with \\"Here\\", \\"There\\", intercut with \\"I want her everywhere\\", before he sings the entire title at the end of the song. And \\"For No One\\" has a nice French horn solo in the middle.<br />\\"She Said She Said\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", both Lennon tunes, are well known as the first drug songs done by the Beatles. They played the latter song on the Compleat Beatles documentary and while doing so, showed repeated twisting zooms on a shot of the Revolver cover. Or is that revolving zooms? That explains the distorted sounds and effects here! I liked Danielle Dax's cover of this song, but I wonder how Phil Collins did it on Face Value.<br />Revolver is the prelude to the wonder that would be followed by Sgt Peppers, but that's a story and/or review for another time.e Revolver cover.

0789723107|5.0|If you're interested in learning how to design a website, start with Jennifer Niederst's books (_Learning Web Design_ and then _Web Design in a Nutshell_). But if you know basic web design and you're interested in making an existing (or planned) website more usable, this is the first book you want.<br />For one thing, Steve Krug is funny. No kidding; you'll squirt coffee out of your nose on every page, at least if you're foolish enough not to put the cup down after page one.<br />For another, his usability principles are very straightforward, easily understood and remembered, and well illustrated by copious examples. Although this book will be most useful to people who actually design websites, it _could_ be read by pretty much anybody (including -- hint, hint -- the _bosses_ of people who actually design websites).<br />He's somewhat at odds with Jakob Nielsen on the question of usability testing, but that's okay. In the first place, such disagreement is healthy in a field where, really, nobody _knows_ anything with full certitude (even when people _say_ they do); and in the second place, Krug is telling us how to do usability testing on a shoestring, within real-world economic constraints. So I say: get Nielsen's _Designing Web Usability_ too, but get this one first.<br />Krug's book is well done all around. And if your boss happened to see it sitting on your desk, maybe even borrow it, the world of the Web might become just a wee bit more civilized.

Vin Diesel brings an X-factor to this movie, along with excellent performances by the rest of the cast.<BR>A movie that says you don't need a Tom Cruise or Harrsion Ford to make a great movie, get an excellent plot back it up with people you can actually act, shoot the movie in Australia, and you have what I would rate as one of the Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ok, I admit it. I was 5 when this album was released. I had no clue about grunge or any other bands of that era. But one day, while in the car with my dad, Alive came on the radio, and I decided I liked it. I was about six at the time. So my dad, being the somewhat unwise person he is, got me this album on tape. I listened to it and Vs. 24/7. For about three years. And then got Vitalogy. And was still in love with those tapes. Later, I lost intrest in PJ. And lost my tapes when we moved. But several months ago, I found them, said, oh, what the hell in a fit of nostalgia, and shoved them in my stereo. Then I realized I had good taste when I was six. Though I also love Vs and Vitalogy, Ten has to be my favorite album ever. Black is my favorite song ever. This is probably Pj's most straight-up &quot;grunge&quot; album, there aren't really any slow songs like daughter or nothingman on this album (unless you count black, which I don't). If you don't own this album already, you need to buy it right now. Your life is incomplete without it. Well, maybe not, but it's still good.
B00004Z311|5.0|Well, to set the record straight regading the actual length of the European version, it is actually only 2 (two) minutes longer than the domestic release; however, there is almost 30 minutes of alternate scenes and alternate dialog which makes all the difference in the world and makes the European version infinitely better then the American cut. I have a bootleg recording of this version, which is the basis of my information. I happen to love both scores, but then again, I am a big Tangerine Dream fan. I can't wait to finally get a clean DVD copy of this awesome movie and throw my &quot;boot&quot; away.
B00000J7SS|5.0|how can anyone dislike this album? i have never been so moved to write a review. i do so because i have read a couple bad reviews on this site. in fact, it was those bad reviews that made me want the album more than the ones that praised it. in the bad reviews people called it dark. i did not detect that at all. i will admit to having little knowledge on jazz, but i know music that i like. just wanted to share my thoughts. only other time i tried this was for amnesiac by radiohead. again, it was bad reviews that moved me to share mine on that album, too. this is good, no, amazing music. recommended to anyone who has an attention span.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|When Angie is on-screen you can't take your eyes off her. The sexy heroine does what she can with what she has to work with, but it is a helpless effort. Tomb Raider serves to be unrealistic, even for a movie based on a video game. For example: why doesn't Lara Croft just destroy the clock once she has found it so that the other pieces of the triangle are useless? Angelina is magnificant and the accent is spectacular, but you cannot ignore the obvious, Tomb Raider was the bomb of the summer.
B00005NZBN|5.0|I'm going to have to rank this one up there with Desire and Blood on the Tracks as my favorite post-60's Dylan albums.  I have to admit that since Knocked Out Loaded, I haven't been all that impressed with Dylan's overall output (with the exception of the brilliant song: Foot of Pride). But here, like he has so many times in the past, he throws the gauntlet down.  There's only one song on this album that's merely good, the rest are great and three of them are brilliant: &quot;Mississippi&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; and &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;. There's only one thing that's depressing about it: when you compare this album to most everything else around us, it shows you how really bad the state of music is in this country today.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Krall's entire catalog is remarkable. But &quot;The Look Of Love&quot; covers some new ground for her - working with orchestras. Some Krall purists may whine about the departure from her stripped-down 4-piece group, but the song selection on this disc coheres very well with the large, lush orchestral accompianament. I own 4 Krall CDs. All are good in their own way, but this new one is so beautifully lush and soothing to listen to that it is fast becoming my favorite. I should mention that I am a dyed-in-the-wool rock and roll fan first and foremost, but Krall (especially this new CD) enthralls!
B00005A0V0|5.0|This was the very first Caravan album I have ever heard and many people regard this as their best one, and I have no arguments about this. Caravan, unlike Soft Machine, Hatfield &amp; the North, or National Health, leans more on the symphonic progressive side than the jazz rock/fusion side. Side one (&quot;Golf Girl&quot;, &quot;Winter Wine&quot;, &quot;Love to Love You (And Tonight Pigs Will Fly)&quot; and the title track, to those who own the CD) consists of great, catchy songs with wonderful melodies. &quot;Golf Girl&quot; features some really silly lyrics about &quot;Standing on a golf course, dressed in PVC&quot;, simply because &quot;It started raining golfballs&quot;. Pretty silly, and great use of instrumentation including trombone and Mark II Mellotron. &quot;Winter Wine&quot; is by far one of the greatest cuts Caravan has ever done, in fact one of my favorite songs ever, with lyrics that are as mystical as &quot;Golf Girl&quot; was silly&quot;. &quot;Love to Love You (And Tonight Pigs Will Fly)&quot; is a very short and catchy pop number, but very well done. Could've been played on radio. I am not much for the title track, sounds a little to much like filler, although I do like the lyrics which seem to be drug-oriented. Side two is filled up with the great &quot;Nine Feet Underground&quot; which is mainly a great jam showing off the keyboard talents of David Sinclair. In the Land of Grey &amp; Pink is by far the Caravan album most dominated by Richard Sinclair, as Pye Hastings only sung on &quot;Love to Love You&quot; and parts of &quot;Nine Feet Underground&quot;. The album cover features very cool fairytale artwork that seems to fit so well on this album. It's too bad that Caravan wouldn't be able to make another album as great as this one, several of their followup releases are definately worth listening to (Waterloo Lily, For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night, even Blind Dog at St. Dunstans) but the magic is more or less gone simply because the band was having trouble keeping a steady lineup. In the Land of Grey &amp; Pink marks their last release with the original lineup of Richard Sinclair, David Sinclair, Pye Hastings, and Richard Coughlin. After the release of this album, David Sinclair left only to be replaced by Steve Miller (not The Joker and Fly Like an Eagle guy, but brother of Hatfield &amp; the North and Matching Mole's Phil Miller), and of course more lineup changes afterwards.

B000056K04|3.0|Dave Matthews Band fans were told of an upcoming album filled with previously unreleased tracks that had helped sell out the summer tour.  Songs like \\"Bartender,\\" \\"Grace is Gone,\\" \\"JTR\\" and \\"Grey Street\\" grew into twenty minute jams that bled from one song to another on stage this summer. Fans downloaded live tracks in anticipation of the new album and wondered what the studio versions would end up as.<br />Everyday is not what the fans were waiting for. Twelve brand new songs, Dave plugging in and not a jam in sight. Everday is the product of DMB and a new producer, Glen Ballard. It is rumored that an entire album was recorded but so filled with depression, Dave wouldn't allow its release.  It is affectionatley referred to as the \\"Lillywhite Sessions\\" after the producer of  Under the Table and Dreaming, Crash, and Before These Crowded Streets, Steve Lillywhite.<br />This entire idea for an album was scratched and replaced with a hurried two month project that is Everyday. The soulful songs of the summer tour, the strain of Dave and his acoustic guitar were audience tested -a major difference with the unshaped sound of Everyday's tracks.<br />The first radio release \\"I did it\\" is an anthem of this album. Dave sings \\"I did it, It was me right or wrong.\\" and later \\"We got a long way to go, but you, ya gotta start somewhere.\\" DMB is changing. They are not the same guys that played frat parties ten years ago and although much of this album is not great, there are a few pieces that could be the transition of the Dave Matthews Band.<br />\\"Space Between\\" is a beautiful song. You find your lips moving along and the chorus can roam around in your head all day after listening to it a few times. The \\"synthesized\\" sounds work well in this song, still, it is not something we want to hear regularly from Dave.<br />\\"Dreams of our Fathers\\" and \\"Sleep to Dream Her\\" are two more old school Dave Matthews songs on the album. Each has the lyrical intensity but lacks the passionate Dave we hear screaming on Before These Crowded Streets.<br />Tracks like \\"So Right\\" and \\"What You Are\\" are bad enough that you can hear the first few notes and never want to listen to the song again.<br />The lyrics to \\"Angel\\" would sound so much better slowed down over an acoustic guitar. This seems to be the theme with most of the songs.  The lyrics flowing from Dave haven't changed, just the sound. This album needed more fine tuning and more audience test. It feels too studio-ized.<br />Hopefully the upcoming tour will bring Dave back around.  Give him a chance to play new songs live and perhaps give fans a chance to change their minds about the new Dave Matthews Band.screaming on Before These Crowded Streets. <BR>Tracks like \\"So Right\\" and \\"What You Are\\" are bad enough that you can hear the first few notes and never want to listen to the song again. <BR>The lyrics to \\"Angel\\" would sound so much better slowed down over an acoustic guitar.

B000001DTM|5.0|U2, the most meaningful and productive band of the past 20 years, reached its musical height with this astounding album. For me, the signature song remains &quot;One&quot; -- which recently was featured as a tribute to unity on the Tribute To Heroes telethon to benefit the firefighters, police officers and others who died in the terror attacks of 9-11-01.<BR>The attacks have been hard on everyone, but bands like U2 have helped us deal with the mindlessness of that day. In fact, we need U2 now more than ever.<br />Lyrically, the songs on War and The Joshua Tree have more power for me, but from a musical standpoint, U2 has never been better.
6305810109|4.0|Alvin Straight is a man of many years.  He has made mistakes, but he has learned when it is time to set aside pride and do what has to be done -at any cost.<br />Based on an actual event, David Lynch's latest film The Straight Story, stars Oscar nominee Richard Farnsworth playing the role of Alvin Straight, a 72 year old man who knows the importance of family, a good swisher sweets cigar, and the awe of a summer sky. Straight comes to a realization that he is not getting any younger when he takes a bad fall and then receives news that his brother he hasn't spoken to in ten years has suffered a stroke.<br />Alvin decides he must leave his home of Laurens, Iowa to visit his brother Lisle in Mt. Zion, Wisconsin. Wanting to complete this journey completely on his own, but without a license or a car, Alvin sets out on his ride-on lawn mower.<br />Alvin meets many people on his adventure north, giving him time to tell stories and give advice backed by his life of experiences.  The drama builds slowly, but the overall effect is resonant.<br />Wanting to capture the outdoors just as Alvin would have experienced it, Lynch insisted the movie be filmed on location as well as in the exact seasonal timeframe. The film moves gracefully through the Midwest American landscape with help from director of photography Freddie Francis, who worked with Lynch on The Elephant Man and Dune.<br />Designed by Angelo Bandalmenti, the soundtrack behind The Straight Story creeps along in a sleepy tone similar to sound design he did with Lynch for the television series Twin Peaks. It provides the perfect emotional backdrop, taking on a darker theme as Alvin crosses the Mississippi River.<br />Another aspect of the film that cannot be overlooked is Sissy Spacek's performance as Rose, Alvin's &quot;slower&quot; daughter. Although the majority of the movie revolves around Alvin, her story and character are vital. Spacek's speech, delivery, and mannerisms as simple as washing the dishes are extraordinarily executed.<br />The Straight Story ends right on time, no more, no less. It is a simple film about a simple subject, leaving the viewer with a gentle sense of calm. As a follow up to Lost Highway Lynch has redeemed himself.ecuted. <BR>The Straight Story ends right on time, no more, no less.

B00000HYXB|5.0|Blind Guardians masterfully crafted symphonic music is nothing short of a turning point in musical history. No longer is it acceptable for an albulm to be a random selection of unrelated songs that sound the same. Blind Guardian sees music as an epic storytelling medium akin to drama, as evidenced by their usage of bardic imagery with the token &quot;The Minstrel&quot; track, and thier &quot;The Bards Song&quot; from a previous work. Musically speaking this work is in a leauge of its own, a spellbinding hybrid of styles as seemingly at odds as classical, heavy metal, and medieval folk. Combined together the well structured riffs will transport you to another world. With the option of purchasing this albulm, I respond: Give it to me, I must have it, precious albulm I DESERVE IT! Where can I run, where can I hide the liner notes, precious gems of lyrical deciphering, thier artistry belongs to me...oh its sweet how, the tolkien fanboys are floating around...WE are following the will of The Tolkien, through the dark age of musical expression into the chaos storm of Fantasy Metal revival!<BR> Now truly Tolkien is king of the world...master of fate...DAMNED SHALT THY HOUSE BE...thou shalt not question his power...NOR SHALT THOU DEFY HIM FURTHER...dowdowdow DUNNANOWWWW dowdowdowodwo, SMASH DOWN THE LIGHT....I WILL NOT REST TILL IM KING, valinors empty now allied the elves and men...THEY SHALL BE DAMNED! I Smash down the light...such memorable lyrics as this stand as irrefutable proof of BG's mastery...Thus ends the 5th chapter of reviewage...by the treachery of modern music, the field of BG fandom is lost...the night falls, great is the triumph of pop music...the league is broken, save the hidden king...only he troubles the Commercial Music Consortium...only he could bring RUIN to the BLACK FOE
6305127638|4.0|Hey, I proudly call myself a Trekkie, but some of the reviewers here take this stuff WAY too seriously. It's only a movie, folks, and I suggest if you are so upset that Zefrem Cochrane is a drunken lout, that you should really find something better to do with your time. <br />This is a fun Trek back in time to, oh, about 50 years from now, after World War III but before Warp Drive. The Borg are trying to wipe out The Federation before they even exist (like most Trek time-travel shows, it's best to not think too hard about the science or even the plausibility of the plot, just accept it and you'll enjoy it far more).<br />The key interactions here are between Picard, who is bent on revenge and redemption owing from the time of his captivity with the Borg, and the Borg Queen. Data also features prominently, and well. There is plenty of Trek humor too.<br />Add in a decent ending and you've got a great Trek flick. Still only 4 stars because no Trek flick is worth 5 stars. (Although I did give 5 stars to &quot;All Good Things...&quot; TNG's 2-episode finale.)<br />Enjoy!
B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It is morbid, but there is so much beauty in it.  The vampire girl is a great actress.  Tom's acting is fine. Antonio Banderas looks great.  I would not want to see so much blood, but it is a vampire movie and vampire movies are bloody.
6305609721|4.0|This is the Trek movie that even people who don't like Trek movies enjoy. A heartwarming if preposterous tale that has our intrepid crew going back in time to 1986 to find some whales, who it turns out, are the key to saving the world circa 2282, this fun frolic in San Fran has tons of laughs, great interplay among the cast and lots of campy but good moments.
0800177177|5.0|This movie is beautiful in the sense of romanticism. Dracula is so human, not a monster, but an immortal being with strong emotions. Ryder's acting is great, and, oh boy, that Lucy is hot ...!! The movie is strong, there is too much blood but (anyway) the movie is supposed to have blood. Great movie! I love it. The final scene is very moving.
6305910103|4.0|The Wrath of Khan is the best and most dramatic Trek movie, featuring vigorous acting from Ricardo Montalban, a great script and explosive (for Trek) special effects. The scene when those brain bugs go into the ears of two of the characters still gives me the creeps! After this, the Trek movies seem to get more and more ponderous, as if the Trek cast, crew and production company are all-too-aware of their cult status. Trek 4, Trek 6 and Star Trek: First Contact are the best theatrical Trek films, IMHO.<br />Enjoy!
B00005NIE1|5.0|Great to see the strokes live, I wonder if their sound will last. I'd be a bit leary of buying this now, give it a sample if you haven't heard it yet...
B000002NBY|5.0|Paul Simon's best solo album takes you on a journey through Africa, with images (&quot;Diamonds on the soles of her shoes&quot;) that will stick with you forever, along with beats and rhythms that create sort of a weird New Yorker folk-African fusion that transcends both genres. Simply brilliant and a deserving Grammy winner (for once).
B000002MNL|4.0|I'm not that familiar with Morrisey. I bought this on a whim in  1995 after hearing &quot;Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself&quot; in a record store. This song's pleasant tone belies the haunting lyrics (&quot;The sanest Days are mad...&quot;). &quot;The More You Ignore Me The Closer I get&quot; also has a hummable quality, until you realize the sadness of the character in the song's obsession with his unrequited love. &quot;The Lazy Sunbathers&quot; is the kind of thing that reminds you of Bob Dylan with a better voice. A rather profound tune about people more concerned about their own minor pleasures instead of the problems of the world (in this case, a clever allegory of people lazily sunbathing while the hole in the ozone layer grows). This is good stuff. Highly underrated.
6305350205|3.0|Watch this after having a couple of homebrews with your nerdy friends...Jeer, throw stuff at the TV during the really bad parts and have a great time on your way to the &quot;Great Barrier.&quot;
B00003CXTG|5.0|For those of you who say that the blood is not depicted accurately enough, do you know anything about what will be in the DVD?  It will have all the rated-R stuff Disney made Bay cut out.  They'll also have behind-the-scenes stuff and a historical documentary.  It's true that this film has been ridiculasly compared to Titanic and that it's a bit long.  The characters weren't nearly as well-developed as Titanic's.  OK, we all know that the story's cheesy.  But the acting was decent enough to make you care about the characters.  Ben Affleck's Tennessee accent was overdone but he was able to make Rafe's emotions believable.  Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin were exceptional though I don't know why Doolittle thought they were gonna win the war through Rafe and Danny.  These guys embodied their characters' tough, no-nonsense attitudes.  The historical aspects were smoothly woven into the main plot.  Plus, the humor is well-done.  The opening foreshadowed how funny the rest of the movie as gonna be.  So kick back and relax afteryou turn Pearl Harbor on and let your TV handle the rest.
B0000542DJ|5.0|Most of the controversy over this movie has to do with whether it is historically accurate. But Oliver Stone's JFK does not make a grand statement as to what the facts are; it merely pokes about a hundred holes in the Warren Commission's account of what happened. At the end of this riveting film, you are left with the sense that Jim Garrison may not have been barking up the right tree, but the lone nut theory (along with the single bullet and all the rest) seems equally implausible.<br />Regardless of the historical facts, this is not a documentary, it's a fascinating film inspired by real events, a scary imagining of what might have been. The acting is first-rate, the editing is the best Stone has ever done and the soundtrack is haunting.<br />Slamming this film over accuracy alone would be like slamming Shakespeare for taking liberties with the lives of certain British rulers and ignoring the work itself.<br />BTW, I felt that the director's cut did not do much to advance the film. I would have preferred these as deleted scenes, because they slow down the otherwise very taut direction...
0553277472|4.0|Robert M. Pirsig's semi-autobiographical, philosophical-fiction novel is in several places brilliant. It will give you reason to pause and view life a little differently.  Contrary to it's namesake, it is not a book about the ins and outs of Motorcycle mechanics.  It is about an approach to life that embraces quality as a virtue and grasping things we don't understand and living with those around us even in a state of turmoil.  It's more about life than motorcycles.<br />Sure, Pirsig's tale centers around a motorcycle journey and he definitely has a love for locomoters of the two-wheel street variety, but at it's heart &quot;Zen and Motorcycles&quot; is a high approach to philosophy and ultimately how that philosophy is turned around to care and love for those close to us...our family and friends and how that relationship is to develop even in times of trouble or when family member's face things and problems larger than themselves.<br />Pirsig's alter ego is a character Phaedrus that is waiting darkly in the wings to enter in and wreak havoc. Pirsig as well as his emotionally-challenged son Chris, must deal with this on a motorcycle trip across the states. The afterword provides us with Chris' tragic outcome and the author finds solace in the journey they had together and loved ones that remain. The book may by a little too deep of a trip for a casual read and may not be complete enough for the philosophical gestalt-expectant, but it's worthwhile putting humanity into deep thoughts. Read it. You won't be sorry.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|All 27 No. 1 hits from the best-selling, most-popular, most-productive band of all time. If you don't own this CD, what are you waiting for? The Beatles are a world treasure. If aliens landed on earth, and asked us for a representation of our culture, this would be the first CD to give them.
B00005AQE8|5.0|2pac comes back for more of the drama. After being released from jail, he starts writing and recording a double cd which would be the first for hip-hop. But it was unknown that it would have this big of an effect on the hip-hop culture, or his career at that. Starting his &quot;reincarnation celebration&quot; Book 1 opens up giving you the &quot;Ambitionz az a Ridah&quot;. From then everything is eventually a plus. Some of his greatest hits were on this disc that did'nt make the greatest hits disc. And it is still selling.<BR>All eyes on me has probably sold 10,000,000 to date. If you haven't heard this immaculate piece of history yet, BUY IT!

B000006045|5.0|I don't know whay but one day I just felt compelled to buy something by Massive Attack. Other than hearing a few samples on the radio once and obtaining their song &quot;Teardrop&quot; from the Pure Moods 2 compilation I didn't know much, if anything about this band. So warily I took my chances and decided on their latest release, Mezzanine. I usually don't buy things on a whim but for some reason this seemed an exception to the rule. So despite the ugly cover art I purchased, took it home, and then popped it into my CD player and let it sit there on repeat until I came to a baffled conclusion... I wasn't sure WHAT to make of this. It's not like I threw it across the room in disgust or anything but at first I felt uncertain... Then suddenly, like lightning it just struck me and on contact I loved it. From the smooth, heavy bassline of &quot;Angel&quot; to the sassy eroticism of &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot; and &quot;Group Four,&quot; featuring Liz Fraser from Cocteau Twins, I could no longer resist their funky undertones of hip-hop and electronic soundwaves with the additional trip-hop flava thanks in part to the guest vocalists of Sara Jay and Tricky-esqued Horace Andy.<br />Other than that, though, I really don't know what else to say about this incredible album. I'm not saying that everything on Mezzanine hasn't been done before and that it's flawless but it's still a treat to the ears. So if you don't already own this than I advice you do so - and soon - For the sake of yourself.
B000000WHX|5.0|Massive Attack's debut introduced the rhythms of trip-hop to the music world, and even if we ignore its historical importance, it is still a masterpiece of its genre. While &quot;Mezzanine&quot; boasts several stronger tracks (&quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Risingson&quot;, &quot;Teardrop&quot;), they have never matched the consistent brilliance of their debut.<br />The album begins with &quot;Safe From Harm&quot;, immediately setting the trip-hop blueprint: soulful vocals, stoned rapping and hazy beats. From that point on, the pace never slows down. The group takes us on an amazingly varied trip, ranging from the dub-influenced &quot;Five Man Army&quot; (featuring none other than reggae legend Horace Andy's exquisite falsetto) to the dance classic &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot;. The title track is equally worthy of praise, making the connection to hip-hop even more explicit courtesy of Tricky, himself a member of Massive Attack at the time.<br />While the production may sound slightly dated to modern ears, the songwriting and vocals are simply timeless. There is no doubt this album will receive even more recognition in the future and once you hear it yourself, you will easily realize why. Simply essential.
B00005JG6R|5.0|This science fiction thriller masterpiece only continues to re-affirm itself as the best Japaneese anime ever created. The story takes place in 2019, the world has re-emerged after the Third World War. Neo-Tokyo, a city that has been beautifully created and drawn into a nightmarish gang ridden metropolis is where the main action is. Focusing first on a group of juveniles in a local biker gang, one named Kanada and the other, Tetsuo, the film sets you up for a wild thrill ride unlike any other. The film divulges into many story lines, exploring a strange government psychic project, in which experiments were performed upon small children. One of them, named Akira, was said to be so powerful that his awakening was the cause of the war which destroyed the world. All in all, an amazing visual and mental treat. Word of advice.. Pay Attention.. if you are not a Japaneese Manga fan you will be lost forever in its incredibly complex plot.
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this cd after a friend told me about the band. I can tell you the first time that I listened to the cd, it was AWESOME. I just couldn't get enough of it. It has an awesome sound. If you don't have this cd you gotta buy it. The best songs on the cd are, papercut, crawling, with you, in the end, and a place for my head. BUY THIS DAMN CD!
B000002KOJ|5.0|With a sole guitar and her voice, Joni Mitchell has achieved perfection. Showing lyrical power reminiscent of Bob Dylan, she has described some incredibly lovely and tragic scenes. Of course her original version of Both Sides Now is THE version, no disrespect meant to Judy Collins. The Gallery still gives me the chills. Listening to this depresses me extremely, though, to think of how Joni's voice is a bare shadow of this incredible work.
B00003CXMG|5.0|again.  That wierd era where rock bands were eventually swallowed up by the disco craze.  What were we thinking?  Cameron Crowe is obviously an authentic student of the era.  If you don't know that the story is a rough autobiography of Crowe's own experience as the enfant terrible of rock journalism, you may find the plot to be unbelievable.<br />Crowe admits to combining many of the elements of several rock bands that he chronicled for Creem and Rolling Stone to create Stillwater, the fictional rock band of this tale.  Sights, sounds, clothing and thought processes of the era are all faithfully reported in this gem of a movie.<br />Watching the Crowe interview in the special features section, and checking out his Rolling Stone articles, you know that the casting director for the film was a genius.  Unknown Patrick Fugit has many of the mannerisms and wistfulness that made &quot;then-Cameron&quot; and &quot;now-Cameron&quot; delightful and admirable.<br />The real star of the movie is the music, and the mix of authentic and pretend rock of the era, along with some of its unusual anthems (all of Elton John's early music touched cords in rock lovers - we weren't sure why we loved it, but we did).  The group scenes in the movie, most set to music, have an authentic camaraderie and sense of &quot;chilling&quot; that made ecletic groups of band members such memorable icons of the era.<br />Crowe was obviously enamored of both his mom and Lester Bangs, an early mentor.  He cast them richly with the incredible Frances McDormand and a beautiful cameo piece by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br />Many of the band members and wannabes were well cast, but the centerpiece is Kate Hudson, who illuminates the screen with her charisma and vulnerability.  A well deserved Oscar for a talented young actress.<br />This film earns a resounding 5 stars - there is not a target audience, because there will be something for everyone to enjoy.<br />Buy, don't rent the DVD!
B000002H33|5.0|Some albums have the power to influence and inspire a listener.  &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; is one of those albums.  This album is without a doubt Metallica's greatest truimph.  It may not have gotten the worldwide recognition of the Black Album or &quot;And Justice For All&quot;, but &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is perfect.  It is an album that defined a genre.  All the tracks on the album fit together taking the listener on a journey of metal mayhem.  I most strongly urge anyone who appreciates music to purchase this CD.  It is not just the greatest metal album of all time, but one of the greatest rock albums and contribution to music ever.
B000002W9P|5.0|After hearing much praise of this band through fellow Savatage fans, I finally got around to buying what I'm told is their masterpiece.  I will say for sure that's it's a great album.  Creative and full of power and speed, by men who truly are in complete control over their instruments.  The vocalist is ok all the way through has a great range with a lot of emotion, though the strength is obviously the dual guitars.  The highlight by far is the epic \\"Halloween\\", which rounds this concept album off very nicely as the battle between good, and evil face off. If you like what can best be described as speed and technical metal (more rock though) then buy \\"Keeper\\" and you won't regret it.  Though not amazing enough to make me buy all their albums it's enough to make me get \\"Keeper Part 2\\" which I'm sure is just as brilliant.
B000050XEI|5.0|Wow!  After 'Paint the Sky With Stars' I didn't think that Enya could get any better.  Well, she can!  'A Day Without Rain' is a beautiful mix of new deeply moving songs from Enya.  This a fantastic CD, the orchestration is unlike anything I've ever heard before.  The lyrics are so perfect, it makes you want to cry.  Enya's voice is light, sweet, beautiful, and haunting.  She is such a gifted singer.  Everything just goes together in this CD, I love it!<br />Some of my personal favorites on 'A Day Without Rain' are;<br />~A Day Without Rain~  A beautiful mix of sounds and emotions.<br />~Wild Child~          Catchy with a great beat.  Love this song (one of my favorite songs!!!)<br />~Only Time~           The beautiful and emotional theme song   from the film 'Sweet November'.  This song is for everyone, even pop and rock fans will enjoy it.  Let me just say, I wanted to see 'Sweet November' after hearing this song!<br />~One By One~           Just adore this song!  Sweet and   meaningful.  <br />~Lazy Days~            Catchy and upbeat, this is the perfect song!  Lazy Days is also one of my favorite songs!  Perfect.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I was so pleased to see another musical on the big screen, just as I was pleased with Evita as well.  I sincerely wish that there were more musicals produced nowadays...I was brought up watching &quot;Funny Girl&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;. I may only be 20 years old, but there's just something about a musical and this one was fabulously constructed.  I loved the cinematography, as the music was superb as well.  I must admit I prefer the songs in the movie that the characters sang, not so much as the songs that were done by artists themself...if i hear Lady Marmalade one more time I will scream.  But in the way that this movie touched me...no other recent movie has done that as much as this one...It made me laugh and it made me cry, and it's really difficult to find a movie like that nowadays...It was beautiful.
B00005J73X|5.0|Bon Jovi is one of my main influence, his Charisma and talent are truly beyond belief, you can feel it in this amazing CDs, for those of you who are just starting with Bon Jovi I would recommend to buy Slippery When Wet to get in the Mood, but for the Hardcore fans this one is a MUST HAVE! Excellent performance in ALL the songs, only the best of the best, nothing was added to fill the CD, nothing is unnecessary, Songs like Wanted Dead Or Alive really get you in the mood for a party, and if you're feeling bad hey check out: Keep The Faith :) Well, I could go on and on, but you really have to listen in order to believe, so don't think twice, just click on Add to Cart - you won't be sorry, I know I'm not.
B000002UZ1|4.0|The first disc is incredible. The second is very good, but not as solid as the the first. I am very glad that I bought it.
0790732203|5.0|This is one of the funniest, sexiest movies out there, and the acting and comic timing are excellent. Filled with great one liners and hilarious characters, plus eye-candy for the guys and the ladies- Tom Cruise and Rebecca DeMornay are at their finest.
0684833395|4.0|Theyre trying to kill me, Yossarian told him calmly.<BR>No ones trying to kill you, Clevinger cried.<BR>Then why are they shooting at me? Yossarian asked.<BR>Theyre shooting at everyone, Clevinger answered. Theyre trying to kill everyone.<BR>And what difference does that make? (25)<BR>Catch-22s antihero questions the ultimate logic of war. And what difference does that make? This is a resounding question throughout the book (and throughout the war), both in which Joseph Hellers creation, Yossarian, plays a vital role. In Catch-22, Heller creates an array of characters whose absurdity is at once satirical, silly, somber, and scathing. Particularly, the passionate, angry, strikingly sane voice of Yossarian lends a certain ironic tragedy both to the mindless pursuit we call war and to the mindless machine we call bureaucracy.<BR>It is important to read Catch-22 not only as a great piece of twentieth-century literature, but also as a primary source, written by a man whose own involvement in WWII allowed him to create this novel and this character. The characterizations that Heller creates in this novel are a clear and scathing indictment of twentieth-century isms, all of which combine to perpetuate aggression and eventually escalate into the total wars of our modern era. These -isms include patriotism, opportunism, capitalism, heroism, individualism, and sadism. In striking contrast, Yossarian seems to transcend these evil -isms and capture something missing in modern warfaresanity. Yossarians desperate desire for self-preservation is the clearest evidence of his sanity and runs counter to all of the caricatured ideals surrounding him. Certainly, like all other novels, Catch-22 has its failingsat times, it seems that the book is an emotional hodgepodge; no mood is sustained long enough to register for more than a chapter; at other times, the action andcharacters almost seem too absurd and farcical to make a valid point; at still other times, the satire seems too formulaic, unable to grasp at the ironies of life. However, for all of its failings, the mood and voice that is uniquely Yossarians allows the novel to maintain a joie de vivre and strength for all time. Yossarians logic is created against the stark backdrop of a tragic and deadly war; however, this logic lives on especially now. At the conclusion of the book, the reader is compelled to ask, of war, of bureaucracy, and of all else, And what difference does that make?<BR>This book must be read by anyone who decides to weigh in on the most recent political conversation regarding war, conflict, and terrorism. Best of luck...and enjoy!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|This movie is worth seeing just for Ewan McGregors amazing voice. He is great!
B00004WCPY|4.0|A graffiti written on the main entrance road to my school (the European School of Luxembourg) back in 1984 read »Welcome To The Pleasuredome«. Back then, I did not quite understand it. Later I learned to, though. For this debut album of Frankie Goes To Hollywood certainly is a Pleasuredome, in an everything but sarcastically meant way. It's a classic, one of the greatest albums (not just of the 1980s but) ever!<br />What a courage it must have demanded to issue a concept album, a long story split into songs, as a debut. Why don't these bands ever last longer? »Welcome To The Pleasuredome« has it all: One of the most beautiful ballads ever performed, »The Power Of Love«; great covers: »Born To Run«, »San José«, »Fury«, »War«; the sexy experimental »The Ballad Of 32«... plus, of course, the outstanding hit classics »Two Tribes« and »Relax«.<br />Furthermore, this import CD contains two interviews which were included on maxi(vinyl)singles.<br />So... »Welcome To The Pleasuredome«!! Frankie say... no more.<br />[A little remark for amazon.com: Your computer predicted I'd give this great album one star... based on the fact that I've given Madonna's »Music« one star!! Well, what's the comparison!??!?!]
6305014140|4.0|There are a couple things I'd add to what I've seen here.  I knocked off one star because of a couple flaws I noticed with the DVD version.  First there was one part where Jubei comes in contact with a bad guy about half hour into the movie where the sound strangely goes muffled for about 5 seconds before going back to normal.  For a DVD I cannot fathom for the life of me how that got through.<br />As to the [explicit] scenes... it seems as though there were cut from the version of the movie that I was watching.  I saw a VHS version which was much more explicit.  I'd wonder if anyone else noticed it.<br />Otherwise, good fights good animation, and good whuppings to be had in this movie.
B00005NIDK|3.0|Yes has flirted with orchestras on several occasions but 'Magnification' is the first real release of this kind of cooperation. And it's promising... and yet it leaves a lot of room for improvement.<br />The title track opening the album is kind of obligatory mediocre until its rocking orchestral noise turns to Jon Anderson's life-giving voice on 'Spirit Of Survival', a song which develops into a potential James Bond score (sorry).<br />'Give Love Each Day' too, is a good mixture of Jon Anderson's voice, virtous guitar play, filling drums, and classical instruments, especially violins. It's a good piece, followed by 'Can You Imagine' which is a decent attempt that however sadly becomes a lot like the mediocre tracks on 'Open Your Eyes' and 'The Ladder'.<br />One of the best songs on 'Magnification' is the balladic kliché 'We Agree', with the acoustic guitar and Jon Anderson in the foreground. It is followed by the superfluous 'Soft As A Dove' - practically a remake of 'From The Balcony'...!<br />And then, finally, comes the true climax of the album: track #8, the 10.45 mins long 'Dreamtime'. It's a rhapsody, an epic, and yet it is the easiest song to catch. 'Dreamtime' is like a fairytale. A journey into what yes, and especially this classical cooperation should be all about!<br />The other long song is placed directly after this feast, and maybe that is the reason why it is somewhat disappointing. 'In The Presence Of' remains very OK though.<br />After this promising but not quite satisfying kick-off, I do look forward to a more worked-through follow-up to 'Magnification'... Gimme more like 'Dreamtime', gimme epic journeys, gimme Yes!

B00003CXA3|4.0|There are few films that everyone should own, and The French Connection is one of them. After 30 years, it remains one of the most compelling crime stories ever committed to film, and it's centerpiece car chase is just as thrilling today as it was 30 years ago.<br />It's a bit of a shame that the transfer isn't quite up to snuff. Like other &quot;gritty&quot; films, the transfer suffers from extensive film grain in daytime shots, with the early scenes in France particularly bothersome. Given the advances in DVD authoring, it's surprising to see something with Matrix-level graininess on the market, but this is a quibble that only videophiles will notice.<br />As for supplements, this disc offers some of the year's best. Two extensive documentaries featuring interviews with many of the surviving members of the cast and crew delve into the true story behind the film and the nature of the production. The BBC-produced &quot;Poughkeepsie Shuffle&quot; even revisits the locations as they appear today, offering a nice contrast between New York City then and now.<br />As an added bonus,  there are seven deleted scenes--remarkable for a film of this age--which can be viewed with or without an introduction from director Friedkin.<br />The French Connection isn't a kid's film by any standard, but it should be noted that the deleted scenes and the BBC doc both contain language and images that parents probably don't want their young children to see or hear. This isn't one of those &quot;soft&quot; R-rated pictures that would pass for PG today.<br />If you love this film, you need this DVD. If you've never seen this film, you still need this DVD, so that you can experience a masterwork of American cinema with lasting power. Who knew Gene Hackman could be a tough guy?
B00005NIDK|4.0|Finally Yes latest album on hand! After one round on CD, I decided to made a copy on tape so I could listen more often while driving. I random the tracklist so I might get a different impression from those who listened the original sequence.<br />The opening track, Magnification, is very interesting. It opens with Howe's playing, then Squire follows, then the orchestra follows (first some flute (?) then violin ensemble). After some few seconds, Anderson enters. White's drumming keep the tempo. The song itself is typical 90's Yes (similar to KTA tracks), but the string arrangement makes this song beautiful. The most important part here is Howe's guitar playing that fills here and there. Although it's a good song, I wish the Magnification is not the opening track. It lacks the strength and power as an opening track.<br />Track 2, Spirit of Survival, is one of the best track. Squire bass' rules this song. Tempo speeds up compared to the title track and again the orchestral arrangement is very beautiful.<br />Track 3, Don't Go, IMHO is a very good song. It's more like a song that should be included in Squire-Sherwood's Conspiracy. At least the vocal arrangement made me think of it. It's a short song, but the orchestral arrangement is quite good. I couldn't imagine why people didn't like this song when Yes played it on recent tour. It's potential to be released as a single.<br />Track 4, Give Love Each Day, opens with strings (violins, cello, etc) and it really gives you a good, enlighten mood. Very beautiful! Thanks to Groupe for making this lovely intro. White's drumming is quite boring in this song. Very monoton. Perhaps the song gave him no other choice than playing like that.<br />Track 5, Can You Imagine, is another gem in this album. Finally Squire on lead vocal and Anderson as backing vox! Squire's voice is just like what I remember on Fish Out of Water album. Again Groupe's arrangement to fill spaces here and there gives you a beautiful environment. Vocal arrangement is not common in Yes' history (at least that's what I remember). So I guess this song was originally Squire's track.<br />Track 6, We Agree, is another good slow-track although I can't comment more about this.<br />Track 7, Soft as a Dove is another slow song. Anderson only accompanied by Howe in the beginning, then a flute (I think it's a flute) follows. Very beautiful, especially Howe's acoustic guitar playing here is one of his best job I ever heard. The song itself reminds me of other Yes song but couldn't remember what. Is it From the Balcony?<br />Track 8, Dreamtime is the BEST track in this album. It represents everything  I expected in a prog rock with orchestra album. In first seconds, acoustic guitar, bass, strings, solo violin, opens with majesty. Then Anderson came with cello on background. Then bass, drum, strings again, etc. WOW! Dreamtime is the best song since Mind Drive!!!! They should have played this song on tour!<br />Track 9, In the Presence of, IMHO is one of the most boring Yes song I ever heard. It's a slow song and its 12 minute duration really proves that this song is one of the weakest in this album. It's four part/ movement just made things worst. There are no changes in tempo (compared to Close to the Edge or And You And I) and I couldn't believe they chose this song to be played in recent tour.<br />Track 10, Time is Time, is the closing track and it's a poppy song.<br />Overall it's still a good album. At least Yes has the courage to made an orhestral album with all-brand-new songs. Not like Deep Purple, Kansas or Scorpions who played old hits from the past. Can't wait for the DVD!!!!!ement is not common in Yes' history (at least that's what I remember).

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan's new release, in its totality, ranks as one of the best albums of his illustrious career.  I thought that Time out of Mind was good but not great, and I believe that the impetus for the Grammy he won (as with Steely Dan's Two Against Nature),was the critics' acknowledgement that he had been slighted in the past, and that his latest offering, while not among his best, was good enough to give him long overdue recognition.<br />That said, Love and Theft is amazing; and it might actually be the best album released this year.  Dylan has assembled a talented and tight band, and this album has a bluesy feel he has seldom produced before.  Some moments on the album almost have a &quot;big band&quot; feel.  His lyrics are as brilliant as ever; and his voice, while sounding a bit worn and veteran, sounds movingly authentic (and much better than the unfortunate Dylan MTV unplugged album, which sadly captured this folk legend at or near his worst).<br />This is a great album; I like it much better than Time out of Mind.  Highlight tracks include &quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot;.  If you are a Dylan fan, I recommend that you buy this album- you won't be disappointed.
0767802470|5.0|I am a lover of comedy and entertainment. This movie is NOT comedy. And I do not classify this movie as entertainment. This movie is one that shows (as close as one can on a movie set) what happens in REALITY. Each and every role could be an academy award nomination. A script which required a vast amount of knowledge of the subject. And the best hollywood effects (It was filmed in Munich, Germany at Bavarian Studios)which surprizes me. I have been through the original set which also amazed me because of the thoroughness and detail the sets displayed. Back to the issue. This sub commander could have been one of our own. His responsibilities an how he reacts to them makes us realize what goes on both sides of the fence. I was never in a sub, however I am now more aware and an feel for these men and women of today because of it. Good acting and actors, good plot, good effects.
0345350499|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  I have read it several times and each time I become engrossed with the story.  I have shared it with many friends.  Bradley's telling of the story of Arthur through the eyes of the women of the time is creative and wonderful.  The powers of God and the Goddess are believable when you read the story.  This book led me to others written by Bradley.  Although I admit I never got into her science fiction/fantasy books, I admire her stories of legends told through the eyes &amp; hearts of the women.  Her tales of Britain are the best though.  Before the Mists of Avalon my favorite telling of the tale was Stewart's.  This is now my favorite.  I throughly recommend this version of Britain's greatest legend.
0780622553|2.0|I love Dark City. It's one of my favorite movies. Definitely in my \\"Top 50.\\" Were I reviewing the movie alone, you would see five stars above. But what you're being asked to shell out your presumably hard-earned cash for is not just the movie, but the movie as presented on a particular medium: DVD.<BR> <BR>DVD is wonderful, if done right. Therein lies the problem: this DVD is *not* done \\"right.\\" This DVD is full of digital artifacts, which distract from the movie, especially with larger screens. The bigger your set, the more irritated you're going to be by the DVD's flaws. My set is only 27\\", but they're noticeable. I saw the DVD (different copy and player) on a friend's 35\\" set, and they were downright annoying.<BR> <BR>Dark City has many shadows, and in these shadows you'll see what I can only describe as blocky weirdness. Patches of mobile color \\"zones\\" that shift amongst each other like the squares in those 1-15 tile games. You'll see this pretty much anywhere it's dark on the screen. Small complaint, it seems, doesn't it? Well, consider: the title of this movie is DARK CITY. And, it is. In a typical movie, this flaw would appear rarely. In this movie, the flaw appears frequently.<BR>  <BR>This movie's visuals are fantastic; too good to mess up with sloppy DVD work. Granted, the DVD's sound is better, but I like this movie so much I suggest getting the VHS version. (The VHS version is available widescreen, essential for this movie's visuals.) Until they fix the shadow portions on the DVD, it's not worth the distraction.<BR>  <BR>=====<BR> <BR>12/2002 edit: I just watched it again this weekend with a friend who has never seen it.  The result is that I solidly stand by the review, despite some inexplicable later comments by some others to the contrary.  The two copies of the DVD I have seen have distracting digital artifacts in dark areas.  It's irritating and noticeable, and my friend asked about it in the middle of the movie without my having said a word in advance.  No kidding.<BR>  <BR>I love the movie.  Doesn't change the fact that it's wrong to sell an ill-produced product -- the DVD itself.
B00005NWM3|4.0|...but then again, maybe not.  At least there are a few bands on the radio who make good music.  Nickelback's debut, &quot;The State&quot;, was a great album.  It didn't blow me away or anything, but I liked it.  One day I was driving along, and I heard &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; on the radio.  I couldn't remember if it was on &quot;The State&quot; or not, but I was quite taken by how great of a song it was.  I was quite sure I would have remembered it, had it been on the debut, but I checked anyway.  Not there.  So, I hear that there is a new album coming up.  Since my birthday was also coming up, I figured I'd ask my grandma to get it for me (oddly enough, she got me the first one for my birthday last year).  Well, I must say it's good stuff.  It's a bit heavier, more melodic, and slightly better than the first album.  There are some impressively heavy riffs in just about every song, and a few solos, although nothing you'll mistake for Steve Vai.  &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is an excellent song.  So far, I have not met anyone, regardless of their music tastes, that doesn't like it. &quot;Never Again&quot; is also a great song, with some very jarring lyrics.  &quot;Too Bad&quot; is an excellent semi-ballad (it'll probably be their next single), and &quot;Just For&quot; sounds a lot like Staind.  Chad Kroeger is an excellent vocalist.  He's no Neal Morse or Matt Barlow (read my reviews if you want to know who they are), but he can convey emotion very well.  The rest of the songs kind of run together, but are not at all bad.  All in all, a decent alt-metal album.  I'd really like to hear more stuff like this on the radio.  I'm sick of bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, and Korn, and wish that bands like Nickelback, Dust for Life, and Full Devil Jacket would get more attention.  They are much more talented, and certainly more deserving of a wide audience.  But, oh well.  It doesn't mean good music doesn't exist, you just have to know where to find it.  Bottom line: If you're sick of the rap, and want some real rock, this is the album to buy.line: If you're sick of the rap, and want some real rock, this is the album to buy.
B00005NWM3|5.0|After hearing the incredible single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, I had to see if this was just a fluke hit on a mediocre album.  I purchased their first album on a whim and decidedly disappointed by the lack of originality, the only song I like on the album was &quot;Leader of Men.&quot;  So I was not expecting to much from this album and what I heard coming from my speakers literally blow me away.  I was so surprised at the awesome musicianship, and improved vocals that encompassed the entire CD, I mean I could not find one song I did not like.  The lyrics were more angst and personal that reminded me of another band that recently hit it big with a huge single, Staind.  The comparison has to be made this album is definetly similar to Staind's in lyrical perspective.  Staind's and Nickelback's hits &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and &quot;It's Been Awhile&quot; are both receiving massive airplay are helping rock make it back into the mainstream.  It could be said that Nickelback is just a mellower Staind, but the power of this album says otherwise and allows them to stand alone.  <br />The album starts with &quot;Never Again&quot; which clearly shows that Nickelback has went in a totally new direction from their debut CD.  It with &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot;, &quot;Good Times Gone&quot;, and &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; are the immediate highlights.  Though songs like &quot;Just For&quot; and &quot;Money Bought&quot; make you not want to skip a song on this superbly made album.  &quot;Hangnail&quot; is another good song that you don't want to miss.  All I can say is that this is a great album, every song is beautiful and thought-provoking.  <br />Call these guys Staind-wanna-be's or whatever but the fact is they have created an album that stands on it's own and makes people listen.  Whatever you do don't miss this album.  Along with Staind and Creed, Nickelback is one of the new purveyors of rock in town.
B000002TQV|4.0|I suppose I was spoiled -- I bought this album after having listened to both OK Computer and Kid A. The Bends is only an appetizer to the latter. The melodies aren't quite right yet, the voice is not quite at home. Out of the whole bunch there are maybe 6 songs that deserve third or fourth listens, and the rest sound just like any other typical mid 90's 'alternative' band. And most of the lyrics still possess that twinge of adolescence that bogged down Pablo Honey. The greatness that is Radiohead stems entirely from OK Computer, Kid A and the angelic Amnesiac. But this album is a good appetizer, an opening act for the big show.
0790729725|5.0|This is the ultimate Mafia motion picture on so many levels. First, Martin Scorcese combines elements of the finest in filmaking technique, incorporating cinematography, lighting, and pace in a way rarely seen in modern cinema. Next, the performance and acting of Ray Liotta, Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, etc, sets the standard of believability and execution in an incredible fashion. Lastly, the soundtrack has so much in the way of effect that hearing the first few bars of any of the songs today instantly takes me back to the exact scene in the movie.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Just when I thought that Diana Krall had scaled the mountaintop with her last CD, along comes &quot;The Look of Love&quot;. This CD proves beyond a shadow of doubt that Diana Krall is now THE benchmark by which any up and coming female jazz singers should aspire. The sultry yet moody feel of this CD will take take you to a higher level of jazz appreciation. One of the cuts,&quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, made me feel like I was in a small, smoke-filled jazz club, the kind that you don't find anymore. This CD is in a word: AWESOME!!

B00005LC4B|5.0|As far as I am concerned Martin Scorsese's version of CAPE FEAR is almost definitely better than the B-movie original. Well, the new movie does glorify its genre roots. Scorsese did confess his fondness for thriller material and had always wanted to make a studio flick. So here it is, a big budget thriller with one-liners and big action finale with a touch of moral shading. Some of the gleeful &quot;fun&quot; in the macabre may put off those who admired past Scorsese work but there is no doubt this is one impressively mounted Hollywood genre movie.<BR>The DVD sports a new transfer and it looks downright amazing in its clarity, contrast, sharpness, and color balance. The DTS track may not be TWISTER or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN-like demo materials but the Hermann Bernstein-inspired score out of my Marantz/Mission setup sounds incredible: power, clarity, and detail in spades. The new 1-hour plus documentary goes deep into the making of the movie and all the key creative people are there to share their thoughts (looks like some of these are used in past EPKs). The many anecdotes &amp; reminiscences especially on the Juliette Lewis seduction scene are well worth the wait.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I don't know how this guy does it -- who can write this much good music on the heels of so much other good music?<br />Adams is a brilliant songwriter and growing vocalist.

B00000253N|5.0|Recently I was compiling a list of texts that truly inspire me, that have impacted my life more than I can put into words. I began with an excerpt from Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller, beginning with the line &quot;It may be that we are doomed, that there is no hope for us, any of us, but if that is so then let us set up a last agonizing bloodcurling howl, a screech of defiance, a war whoop! Away with every lamentation! Away with elegies and dirges! Away with biographies and histories, and libraries and museums! Let the dead eat the dead. Let us living ones dance about the rim of the crater, a last expiring dance. But a dance!&quot; After this I chose &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; by T.S. Eliot, an epic poem about futility and lonliness. Finally I thought If You See Her, Say Hello off this very album, for the simple reason that my eyes started leaking when I first heard it. However, when I put the latter text next to the former it didn't seem to hold up. It seemed like a kind of sweet little song, but nothing special. The reason for this I realized is that unlike some of Dylan's songs(e.g. Visions of Johanna and Desolation Row)that can stand as powerful poetry minus the music, this song, and album, are dependent on the power in Dylan's voice. His voice adds depth to the songs, and this song in particular, allowing them transcend the simple medium being used. This song becomes a touching little ditty about a woman who has moved on in life and a man who cannot. It is not the only great song on the album, though; far from it. The aching storytelling of the well-known Tangled Up In Blue, the poignant, wistful You're a Big Girl Now and Simple Twist of Fate, the powerful Shelter from the Storm all are incredibly enhanced by the beauty that is Dylan's voice. The highlight of the album unquestionably is the comparison between the aforementioned If You See Her, Say Hello and the fierce, cathartic Idiot Wind. Idiot Wind is possibly the most vicious song ever written. It's well-known that this album is about Dylan's break up with his wife Sara and this song comes just short of mentioning her by name. It begins telling of how their are false stories of his infidelity being passed around in the media(&quot;they say I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy, she inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me. I can't help it if I'm lucky&quot;) and how he cannot believe that &quot;even you...had to ask me where i was at...&quot; He goes on to during the remainder of the song tear her down completely, until the final verse when he admits that he too is responsible for the break-up and comes to terms with the fact that he still loves her. It is one of the most incredible journeys in song I have ever taken. The album closes with the melodic Buckets of Rain, which has our narrator on his front porch, looking out into the rain, remembering a love gone bad. This is an album to listen to when lovelorn, feeling no one can possibly understand the pain you feel. There is truly blood on these tracks and we are all the better for it.
0446677450|3.0|Some of the ideas in this book are potentially transformative -- particularly the notion that increasing income through employment is not the best way to get wealthy, or even to get ahead.<br />Ironically, this book shares a troublesome premise with its polar opposite, &quot;Your Money or Your Life.&quot; &quot;Rich Dad&quot; promotes freedom through wealth. &quot;Your Money&quot; promotes freedom through frugality. Both disparage WORK as a vehicle for involvement with the human community.<br />I'd venture a guess that most of us aren't desperate to be freed from working entirely. I know that what I would prefer is meaningful, socially useful work (with reasonable hours and work load) and fair reward for the value I create for others/society/humanity.<br />It seems very cynical and sad to conclude that working per se is so inherently degrading that people should seek to avoid it, either by &quot;getting rich and letting other stupid schmoes work&quot; or by shrinking from engagement with the human economy (as opposed to The Economy.)
B000002BE9|5.0|Now that the hype is over and the weird videos have been forgotten, it's time to pull this one out for another listen. This disc really stands the test of time. It's great fun to listen to Tidal and Pawn back to back. Lots of artists pay lipservice to changing styles when really what they're doing is just chasing trends. Fiona's work shows growth and beauty, but the first disc is every bit as good as the second.
B00005NB0H|2.0|What a let down! There is a good reason the Who never released the Tommy set performed at Leeds - It's simply substandard compared to the rest of the material!  Its unfortunate because the two Tommy cuts available on the 95 remastered Leeds certainly fueled the hunger for the whole set to be released.  If you want a great live performance of Tommy, pick up the Isle of Wight CD.  That performance of Tommy, done six months later is FAR superior.  The subtelty and wit essential to pulling off a live performance of the Who's rock opera seems to be lost in the Leeds bombast. The packaging for the deluxe edition is horrendous as well. It is impossible to not rip the corners of the cover when placing in the plastic slip case.  MCA should have included some new goodies inside as well, but instead rehashed the same pictures and narrative of the 95 CD. Don't waste big bucks on this set!  Stick with the five star 95 Leeds remaster and pick up Isle of Wight (four and three quarters stars!) while you're at it.
B00000JJHZ|5.0|Only a misguided jazz philistine would consider this work anything other than essential, but a few words specifically about Blue Note's DVD-audio version: Unlike a growing number of other titles in this new format, this is a stereo recording, not remastered to other multichannel formats like Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS. That said, this is truly a reference recording, described by the liner notes as Master Tape Sound (MTS). The greater presence, clarity, and dynamic range offered by the 24-bit/96kHz digital data stream is easily discernable even on low-end systems. There will probably never be a more definitive version of this recording. Highly recommended.
1564559149|5.0|This is one of the best read pieces of work I have ever heard.<br />Good job Barron!
6301942647|5.0|It begins with a sketch about a wedding that seems more like a funeral, and ends with a sketch about a funeral that seems more like a wedding. <br />I must have seen this movie over a dozen times over the last several years. It's the only movie I've ever repeatedly rented as often as I have. I keep looking and hoping that it will be less expensive or come out on DVD but I'm still disappointed that that is not the case. I guess I'll have to break down and cough up the bucks to buy it, because it is becoming harder to find at the video stores. I'd really rather buy DVD though.
0380804557|5.0|&quot;Adventures are all very well in their place but there's a lot to be said for regular meals and freedom from pain,&quot; says Tristran Thron, halfway through Neil Gaiman's neo-post-modern fairy tale adventure, &quot;Stardust&quot;.  Tristran is a self-aware, Candide-esque protagonist, innocent and wide-eyed enough to not fear the world beyond the wall of Wall, but cynical and courageous enough to make the most of his adventures there.  Sent on an almost impossible quest by the most beautiful maiden in the village, Tristran's adventures at first appear to be standard fare for heroes of his ilk.  But Gaiman has layered his story with just enough self-reflexivity and meta-fiction to appeal to the post-modern reader.<br />Thorn is aware that he is to become just like the heroes in the books he reads.  He uses this knowledge to his best advantage, and never panics in the face of grave danger (or odd predicament).  But he also falls into the same traps as those heroes he adores.  It makes for an interesting contrast.  Witness his reaction when a young lady he has captured promises to stay put if he just releases her from her chains.  Tristran knows better than to trust her, but does so anyway, for his innocence and sense of the romantic is so powerful.  It is a wonderful contradiction that Gaiman has constructed, allowing him to keep the knowing reader off-balance, asking, &quot;What is the character going to do?&quot;<br />&quot;Stardust&quot; is set in and around Victorian era England.  It is a locale that is portrayed as condemning imagination as a vice, adventure as a crime, and passion as something to frown upon.  Gaiman contrasts this with the wonderful land of Faerie, where Tristran's adventures take place, which rewards spirit, individuality, and love.  Setting the story in a non-fictional locale, and contrasting it with a hyper-fictional one serves the satire here well.  Gaiman points a magical finger at the remnants of Victorianism, and then proceeds to skewer them mercilessly.<br />As many have said here, I think that this would make fine bedtime reading for a young child.  Just make sure that said child is one of keen intelligence, is eager to learn, and unwilling to shield themselves from the horrors of the world.  This is not a fairy tale that's willing to settle for simple handholding and basic morality.  Gaiman is uncompromising in his vision of a utopian fairy world.  His ideal land has passion and romance, but also sex and tremendous violence.  It asks questions about love and death and fate that a naive youngster might find too challenging, and presents scenes of love and horror that a timid youngster will find disconcerting.<br />Gaiman is ambitious in his storytelling.  He knows the cliches of the genre he's working in, and does his best to subvert them, while keeping things simple and familiar.  Unfortunately, at times he lets the story get away from him, only to rope it in at the last moment.  His ambition sometimes outreaches his talent, but I give him credit for trying.  And even though I figured out the ending early on (c'mon, it's pretty obvious), it didn't disappoint me when it arrived.  I was satisfied almost completely by this slight but astounding little book.kewer them mercilessly.<br />As many have said here, I think that this would make fine bedtime reading for a young child.

B00000J6AG|5.0|<br />This is an amazing CD. It's indescribable. The songs are all recognizable as being by the same artist, yet they're all different. I'd recommend this to anybody, regardless of what they say their musical tastes are. Good background music, but also good to listen to intently. Not to be missed.
B00000IPAX|2.0|I wouldnt go as far to say that they completely sold out because they didnt. Its just not their best effort. If you've never listened to punk before buy this. If your into punk dont. Its funny, the beats are awesome, but the lyrics just suck. Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch were better. Buy those or just buy what you want its your money. It's a good CD to buy to make the transition from alternative to POP punk.

6304698798|5.0|With every entry into the &quot;Man With No Name&quot; trilogy, Sergio Leone became more and more comfortable with his overwhelming sense of style. And &quot;The Good, The Bad And The Ugly&quot; is the pinnacle of his talent. Nothing less than a stylistic masterpiece. It would be nice to see movies today take the risks that this one does.<BR>The cinematography is nothing less than amazing. Leone could have almost been a director of silent movies. So much is carried in the images. Much more so than in the lines these characters deliver. So much has been mentioned of his striking use of close-ups and staging of action set pieces, but that merely scratches the surface of a deep tapestry.<BR>Aiding this mastery is Ennio Morricone's legendary score. Though his over-dramatic tone during the civil war elements is curious, it doesn't fault the film. There is more here to appreciate than can be heard in one viewing.<BR>The acting here is also top notch. Eastwood is again dominating. Lee Van Cleef, (who played a different character in &quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot;) makes an intimidating villian. And Eli Wallach pretty much steals the movie as the &quot;Ugly&quot; part of the equation. Their grizzled faces seem absolutely mythical in Leone's vision.<BR>Overall this is the best in the series and one of the finest westerns ever made. It manages to be considerably more thoughtful than it's predecessors. Yet taken together they seem to tower over most other westerns. And as someone who admires a man's willingness to fully engage his creative vision, this film stands out as a milestone of visual technique. In the final showdown all the tension is created through the carefully crafted score and every intricate image. Amazing considering that we are simply watching men staring at each other. Yet it is mind bogglingly riveting. With this film Leone finally let go of all restraint. And &quot;The Good The Bad And The Ugly&quot; is so much the better for it.
B00005N9CV|1.0|This album defines the word &quot;clueless&quot; but it isn't Diana Krall's problem, unless she's also producing without influence from those powers-that-be who want to see her reach a broader audience. True Krall fans want her to return to her roots: intimate, bass led, just you and that voice and that piano. Carmen McRae didn't shine in this milieu, and she knew it. This is not a Streisand or even Ann Hampton Callaway. Krall's voice isn't that good -- it's her style, her interpretation, that makes the connection with listeners.  Strings break that connection. Love Scenes was the best of the best. More of the same, please.
0446525537|5.0|A BEAUTIFUL , heartwarming story.  Without a doubt the best novel I have ever read by anyone, Story has moments of  sadness- times of suspense and a final moment of great triumph.  I hope to read it again several times.
6305696071|5.0|This movie is a classic. It has Gere, who plays a billionaire corporate buyer and seller, who meets Roberts, who plays a prostitute, and the falling in love is mutual. Good supporting cast, humorous moments, tears, fears, and cheers. It has a feel good ending, don't worry. Who hasn't seen this movie?!
B00000F169|4.0|This film, which is a debut film of John Carpenter, is quite preposterous. First, before this film, there is a masterpiece of SF film which is a Stanley Kubricks work 2001: A Space Odyssey. Compared with Kubricks, it is a directly opposite style. Contrast to Kubricks carried weight and is very difficult, this film is funny and absurd. It is a feature of Carpenters films; there are many funny scenes, which transcend an imagination. The plot of this film is nothing special. The spaceship crew who have a mission, but their life is a continuity of boredom, so as to their acting is very funny. Childish pranks of the crew and a pet alien which looks like a beach ball with claws, Ii makes people cannot help laughing. In addition, this film was made when Carpenter was a student of university. It was a low-budget film, so some special effects were little bit clumsy. Nevertheless, it deserves to watch because it is a comedy film, so it makes people feel funnier. As watching these scenes, I cannot help recognizing Carpenters imagination is great. Dan OBannon who co writes screenplay with Carpenter and played one of the crew, after that he created Alien. This is also interesting thing. Anyway, this film is quite funny, and more, soundtrack that also matched with film, made well. John Carpenter usually took charge of music in own films as well as this film; he used amusing music for the soundtrack to make a funny scene.

B000053VAF|5.0|I must confess that I'm an extremely late newcomer to the delightful ViewAskew universe. Unfortunately, I live in Australia, which means I don't have much exposure to Kevin Smith's films - more's the pity. The first time I heard about him was in relation to Dogma and the so-called \\"controversy\\" surrounding the film. After watching Dogma, I must say that I've never seen a more ridiculous case of \\"wowserism\\" in my entire life.<br />In my opinion, Dogma is the most underrated film made in the past decade. This is probably due in part to Kevin's  prediliction towards, uhm...scatalogical humor. On first viewing, his style seems very similar to that of South Park. But a closer viewing shows that Kevin Smith is a writer who very much wears his heart on his sleeve. <br />Granted, Dogma has plenty of poop jokes, but underlying all that is a gentle sincerity and compassion that permeates the entire film. Dogma isn't just a South Park-clone. It's really a sophisticated and well-thought out diatribe against the dangers of organised religion, and the wonderful power and influence that a single idea can have. I found a lot of the religious discussions in the film to be deeply refreshing - it's wonderful finally being able to see people discuss religious beliefs without feeling awkward about it. For that reason alone, Kevin Smith has my undying admiration. <br />I was one of the lucky ones who bought the Special Edition DVD, and not the original \\"feature-free\\" version that was originally released. Regardless on whether you've bought the Dogma DVD already, I strongly recommend buying the Special Edition. There are plenty of good features, including -<BR>- some moderately amusing outtakes, <BR>- every single deleted scene that was left on the cutting room floor, <BR>- and best of all - a very funny commentary from Kevin Smith (aka Silent Bob, also the Director and Writer), Jason Mewes (the one-and-only Jay), Scott Mosier (long-time friend and producer), Vincent Perriera (View Askewhistorian), Jason Lee (aka Azrael), and Ben Affleck (who gets a major ribbing from Kevin). You also get to see video footage of the cast members in the studio doing the DVD commentary. The commentary is the best part of the DVD, as it's obvious that these people are very good, close friends and they get along really, really well. Although that doesn't stop Ben Affleck getting a major ribbing from Kevin Smith every chance he gets! <br />In conclusion, I think Dogma is one of the most approachable and enjoyable films about religion made in the last 10 years. It has a really good mix of laugh-out loud humor and sincere religious discussion. You certainly don't have to be religions (and I'm not) to understand the issues raised in this film. I'm definitely going to watch Chasing Amy, and I can't wait for the `Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back' DVD to come out. Bring it on!
B000059WOD|5.0|I was recently given a copy of Hybrid Theory: the Japanese Import. I became shocked when I found out that track 13, 'My December,' wasn't on the original cd. Why?? The song was beautiful! Of course it didn't sound like a &quot;typical&quot; Linkin Park song, which was why they should've had it on their American debut. Same with 'High Voltage,' track 14. If you ever get the chance, listen to those songs. They're amazing!
0316286443|5.0|Kevyn Aucoin is a brilliant artist, sheer brilliance! His before and after pictures of his models show all the difference of night and day, and although he doesn't give you step by step instructions- it certainly is not a difficult task to figure out from the large pictures included. The book is excuisitly presented, in beautiful hardback and the photographs of the models are well done aswell. I particularly admired Kevyn for using not only celebrities (certainly no shortage either!) but also friends and family of his own, celebrities and other friends. The book probably showcases 70+ DIFFERENT people! Definitly worth the cost- everyone should own this fabulous book. Hats off to Kevyn Aucoin!
6305171769|3.0|In my opinion this flick was a total letdown considering that the movie stars one the greatest killers of all time and also one of the hottest babes of all time but neither of them deliver the merchandise.It's still a pretty good flick with some good scenes but it could have been so much better.
B000000H5J|5.0|From front to back and then back again this cd is incrediable.In most cases when you see metal bands start mixing in the electronica sound you often see them make the mistake of letting the electronica dominate the sound more then the original art work wich the band had already established. But in this albums case Fear Factory will still let you know the new breed of sound is there but not to the point of compensating the lose of the metal roots. Addition to this metal/industrial sound you can see that Burton C Bell is expanding his voice development and mixing more of his melodys with his dry lunges technique wich in many of the songs cases makes the song more understandable of what type of feelings and raw emotions is being set forth to the developing story that Burton has created for you. This cd is a great value if you are looking to get these B sides songs with out paying Jap Import prices but i will warn you these songs do not meld well with the man against machine story or follows the same transition (Ex. Watching the act of In the hall of the mountain king open for a Slayer god of metal concert) But either way save your money and get this one just know when you want to head band and when you want to sit and just listen and when ever you get tired of listening try to locate all the snipets from Terminator 2. Great Cd dont pass up.
B00005KHL0|4.0|This film is seen as one of the greatest horror flicks of all time, many films that came after were similar...Jason the unstopable killing machine was inspired by Micheal Myers for sure.If you don't have this one in your collection you can't be considered a hardcore horror fan.This is the flick that put superstar Jamie Lee Curtis on the map and this is also one of the the films that put slasher flicks on the map it's a must have.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this cd is okay, but if you are a fan of Diana's piano expertise you won't find it on this album. It is heavily buried under the lush orchestration. Also if you like the occasional upbeat tune, you won't find that either. This is the type of music that would be great to play softly in the background and have a conversation over. It has its place, but it is not a cd that merits playing again and again. Every song has the same &quot;torchy&quot; quality, which is fine, but the whole cd? The Look of Love is a great cut and Diana does a good job on S'Wonderful, I Remember You, and Cry me a River, but it needs the more up tempo song thrown in and less orchestration and more of Diana on piano.
B00003CX8J|3.0|I've been a X-Men comic book reader for a long time and all i have to say is who are these imposters playing in the X-Men movie they look and act nothing like the comic book heroes i know.What's up with those stupide costumes the're wearing?The only one that looks true to the original character is Prof X.The special effects are pretty good i'll give them that and i guess Magneto is kinda cool too it's an ok movie if you just wanna watch a movie but i find that hardcore comic book fans will agree that it could have been way better.
B0000027D5|5.0|The early 70s was a period of spiritual involvement for many musicians. For Carlos Santana (as well as his soulmate John McLaughlin of the Mahavishnu Orchestra) this brought a new and intense fire to the playing that would soon exhaust itself, but which is happily preserved on a handful of great records. On Lotus (1973) all of Carlos' trademarks are in place (the minute-long sustain, the furious glissandos), but not yet reduced to cliché. Never again would his guitar spit liquid fire like this!<br />The rest of the band is great too, with veterans Shrieve and Chepito Areas in top form and the twin keyboards of Coster and Kermode weaving colourful webs behind it all. The music is mostly instrumental - a few more vocal tracks would have been welcome (although with the vocalists in question you have second thoughts...). There is much inspiration from the fusion jazz of the period (which Santana undoubtedly influenced back) and some of it sounds rather dated today. Still, 5 stars for the guitar solos alone..!
B00005N9CV|4.0|This cd is probabaly her best.  My only gripe is that there's significantly less piano in it than previous CD's.  Regardless, a must for any DK fan.  Based on how &quot;when I look in your eyes&quot; turned out, you can see she's on a real bossa nova kick right now and that's fine by me.  I suppose I'll settle for seeing her live to hear her play more piano.  The title track is just phenomenal and &quot;Cry me a river&quot;...what a joy to listen to....please, buy this one and enjoy.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is not an album for anyone who booed when Dylan went electric, nor will it be understood by those who mock his unusual voice, or who think that his best works are his protest songs of thirty-plus years ago. Unlike many staples of classic-rock radio, Dylan explores new territory with each album and never tries to satisfy the masses by emulating his youth. The times, they have a-changed.<br />Here, Dylan crafts songs out of the mists of old jazz in addition to such familiar genres as country, folk, blues, and rock. But a Bob Dylan song is a genre of its own. Some songs on this album count among his best ever, although none would be as magical without his unmistakeable voice, which with each record sounds more and more like Tom Waits, Louis Armstrong, or other smoky, raspy crooners.<br />Once you experience what Bob Dylan has been doing in recent years, it is difficult to return to his old classics in their original form. In concert, for example, even when he plays his &quot;greatest hits,&quot; he adapts them to his current sound (and never plays a song the same way twice). Going back to Dylan's old originals, even a great album like /Highway 61 Revisited/ seems almost sterile in comparison. I listen to /Love and Theft/ and am simultaneously amazed and moved. It is such an achievement that the music that made him famous now seems interesting only as an artifact portending the greatness to come.<br />One complaint: The cover is just a slip of paper and does not include lyrics (or photos, or much of anything else).
B00005NWRS|4.0|keeping up with ryan adams is hard enough these days (see whiskeytown's delayed release, try to find the esquires, the pink hearts or various outher side projects...) however this cd was well worth the wait.  gone are most of the production mistakes from his first solo cd but what remains with this cd are the outstanding lyrics and the beautiful music.  let's hope he keeps up this pace and all of his stuff remains this good.
B00003CX9E|4.0|I'm at the point of my life where I'm trying to re-watch movies that I might not have fully appreciated the first time around.  Some movies I have re-watched and still have the same conclusion (such as Sergio Leone's \\"Once Upon a Time In America;\\" while I am much more of a Leone fan today than years ago, I still consider that my least favorite of his).  And then there is \\"Citizen Kane,\\" which I HATED with an absolute passion the first time I saw it many years ago.  Maybe it was because of all of the praise the film gets that jaded my feelings on it.  It could've been all the hate mail I got for giving a bad review of the movie.  Or, it could've been I was a dumb kid who didn't fully understand good filmmaking.<br /><br />It was a little of all three, if you ask me.  Two years ago or so, I felt it was time to give Charles Foster Kane another shot, and now I can finally appreciate it for what it is.  Now, I can see why it gets all of the accolades it has received.  I wasn't a big fan of the story when I first saw it, and because of that it clouded my vision, not allowing me to see how brilliantly filmed it was.  Also, I didn't know the full history behind the movie, which I will get into later.<br /><br />In short, \\"Citizen Kane\\" follows the life of newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane.  When he passes away, he utters one final phrase that has everybody wondering what he meant.  A reporter sets out to find out what it could possibly mean, and what he's presented is a portrait of a very complicated and sad life, no matter how successful Kane had become.<br /><br />The star of the movie, understand, is not the writing--although now I have to say I like it more than I did back then.  The star of the film is the camera itself, presenting us very complex shots that had not been used before.  You can tell that this was Orson Welles' grand labor of love, and was willing to even give up everything in his life for it.  He would use a lot of weird camera angles that would tell the story rather than simply letting the camera face the actors.  Also, Orson gives one heck of a performance as \\"Charles Foster Kane,\\" completely absorbing himself into the role.<br /><br />Also, another thing that really makes me appreciate the movie now more than ever is the FANTASTIC documentary on the second disk entitled, \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane.\\"  I had no idea that this movie was inspired by a real person and because of that, Welles pretty much destroyed his film career with this very movie.  It's a must-watch if you really want to understand what it meant to Orson to have this film made.  That is what makes this Special Edition \\"special,\\" indeed.<br /><br />So, I got rid of my old review of \\"Citizen Kane.\\"  Why?  Because I grew up some and my feelings have changed.  It's not my top favorite film, but finally I can appreciate the love and labor that went into it.  Sometimes that happens to us.  There are films that takes years for us to finally appreciate.  I'm glad I took the trip again with mature eyes and appreciation for good filmmaking. - Michael Crane<br /><br />**NOTE** This new review was written on July 14, 2007**imply letting the camera face the actors.

B00001NFCY|4.0|Personally I think it is a good cd, but it isn't as great as the first album. I think the first album ,had that &quot;bit&quot; of extra energy.
B000002OZY|5.0|Impressive. That's the only word that really sums up my experience with this Who classic. I had heard the usual &quot;great achievement in music&quot; hype, but was a bit apprehensive. I was wrong. This is a true masterpiece, groundbreaking in its time. The musicianship is the real gem here, and the lyrics compliment it. The story can be a bit puzzling at times, but the music makes you forget about that small flaw. Townshend really hit the mark here, rallying his troops to new heights. In fact the two instrumentals, the Overture and Underture are two of the many highlights. I would tell anyone to not even hesitate to grab this and truly be inspired as I have been by this classic among classics.
B00000BKDY|4.0|This is a great album, it's kind of different from the albums before Somewhere in Time, cos on this one they just some nice keyboard and synthesizer effects. This is a must have if you like Iron Maiden. Takes you right back to the good old days!
B00005JKES|5.0|Ever since David Lynch and Mark Frost (the oft-forgotten co-creator) introduced &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in the spring of 1990, television programmers have striven to duplicate its idiosyncratic qualities, but with little success. Confining the series to one particular genre is impossible: it is part murder mystery, part comedy, part supernatural horror...a flurry of hyphens are needed to accurately classify this television masterpiece. Lynch expands upon his idea of a small American town seething with dark secrets--a central theme found in his 1986 film, Blue Velvet; Frost uses his previous TV experience on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; to create a concrete blueprint from which Lynch can unleash his cache of eccentric townspeople. Laura Palmer's death has an unsettling effect on the good people of Twin Peaks and the outrageous plot twists used during the murder investigation keep viewers guessing and compelled to keep watching further episodes. This boxed set collects the first seven episodes--minus the two-hour pilot--which comprise the first season. Laura's murder isn't solved at the conclusion of the first season (much to the chagrine of the casual viewer in 1990), so viewers interested in the labyrinthine mystery will have to wait for the second season boxed set (The second season slowly, intricately solves Laura's murder, falters and sputters for several episodes and finally gets back on track with the Agent Cooper/Windom Earle &quot;chess match.&quot;). I sincerely plead to whomever owns the rights to the pilot that they release it on DVD soon (and keep the &quot;European ending&quot; on a deleted scenes menu). Inspiring a succession of eccentric, if somewhat more mundane, dramas (&quot;Picket Fences,&quot; &quot;The X-Files,&quot; &quot;American Gothic&quot; etc.), &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; is long overdue to be preserved on the DVD medium.
B00005NWRS|5.0|The cd is so amazing and filled with uplifting but creative ballads and songs.  Fast rock to slow songs.  This album has it all.  It is so American and is perfect for what we are going through right now.  La Cienega is my favorite track.  But I have not heard one song that is not a huge hit.
B0000024R8|3.0|In a mid 1960s review, Bob Dylan said that what disgusted him was all these people suddenly deciding they'd just start writing songs without any real knowledge of the traditional body of songs that have been before them.  When asked about his own songwriting, Dylan said he didn't start writing his own songs until he had immersed himself in the tradition of his chosen field: folk songs from the American tradition.  Some forty years later Dylan's newest lp is a testament to this fact.  On his debut he was practicing and doing his own research in the folk-blues tradition to give his work much more depth than those people who just began writing songs without any sense of history behind it.  That is what makes LOVE AND THEFT so rewarding: you feel Dylan giving us a history of modern musical traditions other than rock and presenting it in a rock context.  This year, in an interview, Dylan said that the radio made \\"hideous noises,\\" and there was none of the great musical tradition which made radio in his day so rewarding.  So with LOVE AND THEFT, Dylan gives us a study in the musical structures of the past, and instead of it being a pale imitation LOVE AND THEFT raises to the level of a grand artistic statement that ranks among his best work.<br />So why am I going on and on about an album released forty years after this release?  It's because LOVE AND THEFT would not have been possible without this.  This is Dylan trying to pass for a rough, gravelly voiced old singer who's been thru hell and back and lived to tell all about his adventures.  Now he really is an old gravelling singer whose has a tremendous amount of experience and has actually become what he was trying to be forty years ago.  His voice has always been one of controversy, and this is just as rough hewn as any of his releases.  If you're this far into Dylan's body of work, you've come to the same conclusion that most of us have: Dylan's actually a very good singer, just not in the traditional sense.  His voice adds much to these songs, giving them that edgy feel which they need to accomplish what Dylan wants them to accomplish.<br />Dylan goes through 11 standard folk songs with a faster tempo than you'd expect (the tempo gives the album that edgy, paranoia feel) and each carry the weight of tradition behind it.  Dylan, in a truly skillful way, captured the sense of history that accompanies each of these songs.  Each song sounds personal and very relevant to the singer himself, which is amazing because of all the death obsession prevalent on the album.  Dylan was only twenty at the time this record was cut, and yet he truly made you feel he was \\"fixin' to die,\\" (which, btw, is more famous as the eleven minute monster on Led Zeppelin's PHYSICAL GRAFFITI) and that when he did you would need to his grave was \\"kept clean.\\"  In \\"Freight Train Blues,\\" Dylan holds a note for probably the longest in his career, and after he finishes you expect him to be sucking air and yet he keeps right on singing.  For you Animal fans here, we have the five-minute \\"House of the Rising Sun,\\" which Dylan appropriately sings in high anguish.  <br />And what of the two original songs?  Dylan, the poet laureate of rock and roll and one if its most important songwriters, only has two original songs on his debut.  For reasons already discussed, it is obvious why.  \\"Talkin' New York Town\\" deals with Dylan's arrival in New York and his struggles there, and \\"Song to Woody\\" is his own tribute to Woody Guthrie, the most influential person in Dylan's young life.  Each is startling. <br />Although this record does not point to THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN (judging from this, you could not deduce that Dylan's next lp would be one of the top albums of the 1960s), this album stands as an important introduction to Dylan and his muse.  For those who want folk Dylan, I personally recommend his next three albums before turning to this.  Although this is a fine LP, Dylan's body of work is large enough to make thismore for the student of Dylan and music in general (which is impossible to study without a strong focus or emphasis on Dylan and his counterpart The Beatles) as opposed to the fan of Bob Dylan.  BOB DYLAN becomes much more important in retrospect than it ever did upon its original release, and without Dylan soaking himself in all these traditional songs we would never have gotten a lot of the top rate material on THE BASEMENT TAPES (official and otherwise) or LOVE AND THEFT or TIME OUT OF MIND or much of his other material.  Of his nine studio releases in the 1960s, this one should be the last on your list to buy, but for anyone who really wants to know Dylan (which is a very hard thing to do: people have built entire careers on the foundation of trying to figure him out) this is essential.  Listen to this and then listen to LOVE AND THEFT and you can see the process which Dylan has been going through.  He still covers a good number of traditional songs in his concerts.<br />For all you songwriters (and writers in general, for that matter) out there, take a lesson from Dylan.  Study and immerse yourself in what's gone before and it will greatly broaden your own work.
B000003TA4|5.0|Who among us will forget those immortal words, or where we were when we first heard them?  Nirvana is a band that has forever changed how I look at the world.  They are almost solely responsible for the Seattle grunge scene, and for that I am grateful.  I was very proud to say this band resided in my hometown, and being in the middle of the whole grunge thing was a feeling I'll never forget.  When I first heard that Kurt had taken his life, I hoped beyond all hope it was not true.  This was (to the people of Seattle anyway) an event almost as earth-shattering as Pearl Harbor.  A lot was lost when this man died.  Anyway, this album has much to offer, from hard rock (&quot;In Bloom&quot;) to softer stuff (&quot;Something in the Way&quot;) to punk (&quot;Breed&quot;), and never misses a step.  It may not be that technical, but that doesn't stop millions of people (including myself) from considering it a masterpiece.  &quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot; will always be one of my favorite songs.  Just hearing it almost brings me to tears, in memory of the good old days.  I cannot describe what this album means to me.  There is nothing else like it.  Rest in peace, my friend, you are greatly missed.
B000002HIK|5.0|A definitive example of RDJ's best work, and _THE_ essential Aphex Twin record, so far. Might be a little too &quot;chirpy&quot; (not like happy, but like too many `chirp' sounds) for some people more familiar with RDJ's thumpier work, such as the RDJ Album, but inarguably a good record.
B000000H64|5.0|Oh man!  If you love heavy music and haven't heard this, you really don't know what you are missing!  With &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, FF created a deadly bionic monster of an album that crushes, and then crushes some more.  I can safely say that I've heard few albums (including death metal) that can match this beast's mighty brutality.  The riffs will kick you hard, and Ray's drumming will blow you away.  The vocals are great too, and I really dig the &quot;Terminator&quot; themes.  The only bad thing is that there are no solos, but oh well.  If you love industrial, hardcore, or death metal, you need to get this album.  I also recommend Meshuggah's &quot;Chaosphere&quot;, and the new Slipknot album, &quot;Iowa&quot;.  Man, this is some heavy stuff!
0792846710|3.0|From the title you'd be expecting something pretty daft &amp; not too taxing on the brain. This is what you get with KILLER KLOWNS. That said, this is a compliment. If you are a horror buff or just enjoy the odd helping of pulp this is well worth a look, though it might be a while before you decide to eat cotton candy again. PS: This review is not up to my usual standard as I have had a few beers prior to writing this. ARRRRGGGHHH!!!!
0783117388|1.0|HBO is trying to push the envelope with this trash.  It is very sad that these women seek to find love through casual sex as opposed to true meaningful relationships.
6305127638|5.0|In my opinion, I believe that First Contact has by far been one of the BEST Trek flicks to date, from the beginning as the camera zoomed out of Picard's eye to show the vast Borg cube he was in when he was assimilated, to the end where the Vulcan got spooked by &quot;Ooby Dooby.&quot; It has a serious tone, but we also get a glimpse at the past, to see what made the Star Trek universe what it is now (in the 24th century that is).<br />Even though the mood was dark, enhanced by great music conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, and also some from his son Joel, it had its elements of humor as well.<br />By far, the best scene in the entire movie would have to be where Riker finds Troi totally wasted at the bar: &quot;Timeline? This is no time to argue about time, we don't have the time! *long pause* What was I saying?&quot; and after Riker confronted her, she was adamant. &quot;I'm not drunk! It's a primitive culture...I am just trying to *blend in.*&quot; Riker's reply and Troi passing out at the table...I fall out of my chair laughing every time I watch it...sometimes I pop in the DVD just to watch that one scene, its that good!<br />I do have to admit, I did not really like to see Cochrane portrayed as a drunk...but then if he did not do all that drinking, we would have missed Geordi's response to his &quot;I have got to take a leak.&quot; Another great scene!<br />All in all, a great flick, and I also love the fact I get to see the trailers for the movie again...they give me goose bumps. Though I found it real funny in the theatrical trailer, they had quick clips from the last TNG episode &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, Star Trek: Generations, and there is even a snippet of VOYAGER firing phasers at a Borg cube!!! What was up with that one? *shrug* Oh well.  Its worth the money for any die-hard fan.
B00004U8P3|5.0|I have never been more frightend in a theatre than during the first T-REX scene in this movie.  The plot-line is good and the dinosaur scenes are spectacular!
B00005NZBN|5.0|When I first heard it, I thought that this album sure is going to be one of the best, most important ones. His talent will never die... as long as he lives.
0446608955|5.0|This was my first Sparks book, and I enjoyed it so much I am looking to read them all.  His writing style makes you &quot;see&quot; and &quot;feel&quot; the details of his story, and his tale takes you through the full gamut of emotions.  The prologue of this book is important, and true to its word.  A wonderful read for anyone who enjoys a good love story, and the meaning of real friendship!
B000004286|5.0|This is my favorite soundtrack of all time.<br />One thing that annoys me: [...it]wrongly states that Braveheart won an Oscar for best score.  ItDID NOT!!  It lost to Il Postino in 1996.  Now... who listens to that soundtrack?  Anyone?  They made a big mistake that year  :(  Braveheart shouldve won.
B0000029DD|2.0|I really wanted to like this.  I've heard so many people gush over Jeff Buckley and how wonderful he is and how I absolutely *must* get this album.  I even pretended to like it, because I felt like I ought to.  But, well, I don't.  There's some good stuff here, but, having listened to so much of Tim Buckley's music, I can't help feeling what Jeff did was only a good start.  Tim really knew his voice and did some amazing things with it.  Jeff was a good interpreter of others' songs, but he hadn't quite arrived as a songwriter.  Tim, of course, wrote his share of duds, but he wrote some wonderful songs, too.  And his best ones sound effortless, which is more than you can say for Grace.  Sketches... shows Jeff moving in a really interesting direction, and it's unfortunate we'll never see him fulfill his potential.
B000002LGQ|5.0|1989 spawned several notable and unforgettable albums, including Like a Prayer, possibly the most notable and unforgettable of them all! It's must for any music fan, let alone a Madonna fan.<br />After a bitter end to a marriage with Sean Pean, this album seems to talk about the relationship on tracks such as Love Song and Till Death Do Us Part. Her music matures extremely after having to deal with such life issues.<br />Madonna's voice reaches new heights on Like a Prayer. Like a Prayer combines gospel, dance, pop, and some kick butt guitar playing! With a haunting beginning it is hands down MY favorite Madonna tune! Express Yourself is a fun funky dance track, but I find it a tad overrated. Love Song is described as the 'throwaway' track, but does grow on you overtime. Not up to Like a Prayer's standards, but its still pretty good. The next track, Till Death Do Us Part, is one of the most underrated Madonna songs ever. With an awesome beat and an unforgettable vocals that seems to talk about her divorce. Promise to Try is an aching ballad, which is either saying goodbye to the little girl inside of her, or bidding farewell to her mother, which this album is dedicated to. But she hasn't lost her sense of fun and innocence, which she proves with Cherish and Dear Jessie. Oh Father is another song to make you cry, about her family life. Keep It Together is anoher dance gem, about keeping it together in the family. Then the haunting Pray For Spanish Eyes combines latin music with pop, La Isla Bonita with a more serious edge.<br />But of course Madonna has a sense of humor, and to end this album she tacked on the Act of Contrition, with has a backwards version of Like a Prayer with some kick butt guitar playing where Madonna recites a Catholic prayer, the song ends abruptly, with a comical ending.<br />The album also spawned the unforgettable videos Like a Prayer and Express Yourself. Madonna's Thriller, if you don't own it you should be spanked!
B00005NWRS|5.0|No, really. This is a brilliant album, the real thing, a classic. Don't think twice, just buy it.
B00000BKDY|5.0|Somewhere in time, other than being a metal classic this album means whole a lot to me.Firstly it was the first heavy metal album I ever bought , in 1986. I never get bored with this album even though I have listened to it million times. It s always fresh, energetic and original as the first time.<br />Starting from the fist song &quot;Caught Somewhere in Time&quot; till the last track of album &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; , Iron Maiden blows up your mind once more time just as they already did with their previous albums from &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; to &quot;Powerslave&quot;. The main difference of this album from others is sythesizers, and which doesn t destroy their well-estabished metal sound. Instead of doing critics of each song , actually all of em are candidate to be metal classic , I ll just say , just add this album to your archive.
B00005JKHP|5.0|It's hard to put into words what this film means to me. I am a fan of science fiction and not just star trek. I think to be able to appreciate this film you have to enjoy the great marvels of science fiction itself, like ships that can travel vast distances, alien encounters, the relationship men and machines. The reason I think why it moves slow is that the film tries to present to the veiwer a more breathtaking scenic transition from TV series to film. New ships, better special FX, new uniforms. When I see this movie I am instantly transported to the 80s where I didn't get to see many space films like this, especially on TV since my family didn't have cable back in those days. Like Tim Burton reading Sleepy Hollow with his shoes off, I feel the same way with this movie. I feel like kid again.<br />There are some parts which could have been more developed, seeming out-of-place, the meeting with admiral nogura which would fit nicely in foreshadowing kirks reason for commanding the mission in the first place, and also the part where Bones is telling his own friend and captain that he has an obsession with the enterprise. It shows a different side to kirks character.<BR>Because of his own pride, his own rules and his own decision making gone stale and the loss of two crew members because of it, would justify the way star trek II opens. <br />To me as a fan of sci-fi, this film enters a whole new reality where the truth is more stranger than fiction. I have seen this movie constantly when I was a boy and it was one of the many movies that I slept through everytime it aired on TV I was too little to understand it's signicant message. When I finally discovered what it was all about, what spock was trying to express in all open emotion I finally realized just how gigantic and incredible the plot really was. How beautiful! One of my favorite parts is where kirk and bones (after leonard nimoy's recovery sequence) reflect on the human part of Vger's pupose and McCoy having frowned upon situations reguarding men and machines before, actually amused by this one. Think of a machine trying fullfill it's physical knowledge of it's creator as well as mental. <br />In conclusion, this movie is still first of all star trek films and despite it's sleepy moments I still watch it in awe of it's beauty it's mystery and its subtle drama and it's thought provoking moments. Notice that one of the advisors for the movie was Isaac Asimov. To those who love Asimov's works you will like this different trek rendition of a asimov like plot. Asimov probably wished he had written this story himself. More than science fiction. It opens up a new world of science fiction not just star trek.
B00003CXQX|5.0|How many times can you hear a 20-year-old say &quot;Um, I've been turned into a cow.  Can I go home?&quot; and still think it's funny?  Apparently, a LOT, as this is my roommate's current response to any and all trying situations.  Not to leave you with any sort of negative impression, the two of us basically consistently crack each other up repeating one-liners and watching our copy of the hilarious Emperor's New Groove every time we have the opportunity.<br />Although I have a bias in favor of Disney movies, enjoying nearly every movie since the Little Mermaid, and most before, even my friends with more &quot;discriminating&quot; tastes enjoy this movie, as well as the various children I am acquainted with.  Disney employs a great graphic style, the perfect voice characterizations, and a script that flows smoothly from joke to joke and humorous scene to humorous scene, leaving the viewer all &quot;warm and tingly&quot; from the strong postive message and vibes.<br />Until Disney's next great movie comes out (which should be soon, right???), we're going to keep watching Groove and laughing out loud.  In other words, &quot;Squeaken squeak squeak.&quot;
B00005NWM3|5.0|Wow. When I walked into the CD store, I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to buy. But there it sat right in front of me. I bought Silver Side Up and popped it in to the nearest CD player. I had expected good from Nickelback, but this blew me away. Except for a few songs, this CD brought a completely new sound for Nickelback (except for those who have the earlier works), but fans will not be disappointed. This CD, unlike the State, really deserves the parental advisory sticker it didn't get.... On other CD's, you have to listen a few times before you can decide if you really enjoy it or not. Not Nickelback. After the first time through the lyrics were stuck in my head, and it's all I've been listening to for the last two weeks. It brings a much harder sound to Nickelback, one that I believe you will enjoy.
B00004Z459|5.0|I had only heard 2 songs from Linkin Park, and that was &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot;. One of my friends said that I should listen to the whole CD because it's good. He wasn't lying !! This whole album is just awesome. A couple of songs I like are &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot;.  Definitely an album worth buying !!
B00000IQW0|4.0|This movie or pilot episode had a neat concept (that we may be decendents of ancient times)however you lookat it, shown on ABC in 1978 this film like Star Wars before it was ahead of its time in special effects, not to mention character developement. It should be noted that Universal Pictures had the opportunity to do Star Wars, but turned it down flat, i'm sure they were kicking themselves after its grand success, but i don't consider this to be a rip-off, Battlestar Galactica had similar themes, but was quite different in many ways, i'm sure Universal was trying to make up for their poor decision about Star Wars, but Battlestar plays out a different scenario. Universal should release this in its entirety as seen on the SCI-FI channel, the uncut version is much better than this cropped version, it shows more depth and it is a shame that Universal didn't take this oppurtunity to do this for DVD, until they do I will not buy it, like one reviewer said &quot;There is money to be made here&quot; I only hope Universal will do this eventually as well as releasing the episodes that followed, like any show there were good &amp; bad episodes, but the good ones would be money well spent, I, like many fans feel like this show was not given a fair chance, if Universal wants to make any money they may have lost on this series, they now have the chance to make it back in more ways than one, i know i am not alone when i say this, but it an oppurtunity that should not be ignored, hopefully Universal will get its act together and do it for the fans as well as make themselves money, anyone listening??
B000002H97|5.0|This album is a masterpiece, it contains lead solos and memorable riffs and also shows Metallica's softer side with the likes of 'Nothing else matters' and 'Unforgiven' but the heavy side of the band doesn't suffer.  This is the album i would reccomend to the uninitiated, aswell as the die hard metal fans.
067942850X|5.0|This is a page-turner &quot;mystery&quot; even though you know how it ends from the cover of the book.  Except for the occasional wanderings of the author about his own escapades (which are tolerable) I found the story well layed out and very readable. The history lessons are also very welcome.
B00004Z459|3.0|4 words...  cure for the itch.  This spoils the WHOLE album!  SOME angry songs, but they lack any memorable riffs that bands such as Papa Roach and Korn have.  Buy it to bolster your record collection but i wouldn't hurry to but it.
