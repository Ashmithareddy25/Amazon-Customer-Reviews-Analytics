034544678X|5.0|This book was great.  Really helpful in understanding how and why your dog behaves the way s/he does.  Also helpful in learning to deal with other animals you don't know well.  I volunteer at my local animal shelter and found the information in this book extremely helpful in working with these animals- many of which are frightened by their new surroundings.
0930289455|5.0|I was expecting a bit more from this story as far as bulk given the hype surrounding it, but for a prestige format one-shot, it is truly remarkable.  <br /> <br />A brief story on how I can across it: I had heard of \\"The Killing Joke\\" for years now and had always wanted to read it. When I went to a local used book shop (where I NEVER know what I'm going to find, and where I buy most of my comics save for Amazon), I found this thin little book between two larger TPBs. Imagine my surprise when it turns out not only to be the famous \\"Killing Joke\\", but that it was only 50% off cover-price ($2.50 as opposed to the $50 I've seen it go for since). Sorry, had to brag. <br /> <br />Now on to the story itself...WARNING SPOILERS: The Joker, probably one of the most evil men in comics finally has his origin told, against the back-drop of a horrifying attack on Commissioner Gordon and Barbara (leaving her wheel-chair bound). The story starts with the most thought-provoking scenes to grace a Batman story, Batman travels to Arkham to speak with the Joker about their relationship and history (\\"one of us is going to kill the other...\\"). In the end, Batman and Joker share a strange and kind of humorous moment, when Joker actually tells a joke that Batman actually laughs at. Alan Moore writes this not-so-epic but truly amazing story. You can't go into this book thinking it's an all out battle royal between Batman and the Joker; it's not even close to that. This book is about a relationship between two old foes, and how they got to where they are now. As I said before, this is a one-shot issue, not a long graphic novel, so it's a very short read, but it didn't need to be any longer then what it was. Perfect story pacing, tight dialogue and very little extra; this is nothing short of great storytelling.  <br /> <br />PLEASE NOTE: This story is also reprinted (for much less of a price tag) in the TPB \\"DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore\\", with several other great Alan Moore shorts (including \\"For the man who has everything\\", which a JLU episode was based on).  <br />
B000E9910W|5.0|I have been a fan of the Doobie Brothers since 1971. I like everyone else bought all of their greatest hits <br />CDS, and box sets. The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers is the DEFINITIVE COLLECTION of their career. It  <br />contains all of their hits plus a few bonus tracks that make it THE CD to own. With the inclusion of such <br />non singles such as South City, Midnight Lady, Eyes of Silver and Need A Little Taste of Love, help establish <br />this collecrtion as the only one you will ever need by the Doobies. The addition of Ordinary Man, which <br />is perhaps the best song that the Doobies have recorded in over 20 years, is just icing on the cake. GREAT <br />COLLECTION. GREAT SOUND. GREAT VALUE.
0374105235|5.0|A Long Way Gone was a remarkable book.  The narration is divided into three parts--before the war, being a soldier, and  learning to become human again.  The LL Cool J and Run DMC references surprised me because it showed just how far-reaching music (and media) can be.  Sadly, the opposite is not true: little media attention was (is) given to the plight of child soldiers around the world.  I hope this book will start the conversation.   <br /> <br />I was struck, and almost disturbed, by the matter-of-fact tone Beah used to describe the atrocities he committed, but his overall linguistic elegance made the descriptions of his travels and the reflections on his life uplifting by the end.  How he was able to \\"rehabilitate\\" himself after living that surreal life demonstrates his strong sense of self.  The book ends somewhat suddenly, but then, Beah's life story is still unfolding at age 26.  This is a stark, but beautiful, narrative.

B00008QSA5|5.0|The amazing thing about this album is that it have held up over the last 38 years.   This originally was planned as Bloomfield/Kooper album.  However when Bloomfield was unable to show up and finish it due to drug issues, they went out and had Steven Stills fill in.  It is for all intent and purpose a great blue album by three white guys that was largely unknown at the time.  This was recorded three years before Stills made a name for himself at Woodstock. No I have not forgotten the Buffalo Springfield. It was also shortly after Kooper left the Blood Sweet and Tears.  Bloomfield was fresh out of the shadows of Paul Butterfield and Elvin Bishops. <br /> <br />The album started off fast and hard with Albet Shuffle and keep up the pace for 8 more tracks, including a remix of Donavon \\"Season of the Witch\\". <br /> <br />There are four \\"Bonus\\"tracks that neither added or subtracted anything to the overall experience. <br /> <br />This album is a gem.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Before I saw this movie I wondered: Is any evidence presented other than rising average temperatures over the last 100 years?  Well they say infrared rays are reflected back to earth by greenhouse gases i.e. pollution, but they don't explain how the existance of these infrared rays has been observed and documented, or show any documentation of them being reflected by pollutant gases, you're just to take those things as a given.   They also talk about an experiment that measured carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and saw it to be increasing, but don't show how the weather balloons captured their atmospheric samples, don't show specific yearly readings, don't even specify the exact increases by percentage.   I'm not disputing the accuracy of the claims, I'm just pointing out the lack of information. You will walk away from this film with more of an understanding of potential consequences of continued global warming but no legitimate understanding of the cause, unless you are already familiar with the existence and nature of infrared rays and weather balloon experiments.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I love this CD -- every song.  The DVD left a bit to be desired because <br />there was no singing on it.
B000M341QE|1.0|.  My reaction to watching this movie is similar to reviewer \\"WebViking's\\", except I give it only 1 star.     Like \\"Parsifal\\", the opera that starts at 8:30 and three hours later, you look at your watch and it's only 8:45, there is a point at which you think this story will never end, and indeed it doesn't. I would periodically look at the clock, and when it was over (could tell by the credits rolling), would swear I had wasted at least three hours of my time.    I thought I was too dense to get the plot(?), but after reading what other reviewers wrote, I am relieved to learn it isn't just me. It is overly-complex for its fast pace. Also, in order to follow the climax (resembles the one in \\"French Connection\\"), you have to be REALLY good at how  cell phones work.    As for the ending? I can't spoil the ending because it never really ends  -  you are left hanging. Like \\"Once Upon A Time in the West\\" is number 11 on the list of 10 worst movies, this has got to be number 12 because there is no room for it in the ten. I don't care about the credentials of anyone else who says it is a good film. Even though this over-bloated-with-\\"f'ing\\"-dialog story appears to have a lot going for it, especially cast-wise, it turns out to be a 135-minute Parsifallian test of your endurance.    As others have noted, the plot involves two undercover operators, one in the police working for the mob, and the other in the mob working for the police. To conceal the existence of the one working in the mob for the police, they cook up an elaborate scheme to have him agree to go to prison for a while and do everything else to convince everyone he is a real mobster. One would think he would have no contact with the authorities for fear of blowing this cover, but one would be wrong. Now, remember, no one knows how many moles are in the police or who they are, but this guy infiltrating the mob pays periodic visits to the police psychologist (at the police building!) for stress counseling. The psychologist is a young woman who provides the requisite female love-interest for the women watching this story. They even take a stroll in the courtyard outside the police headquarters! Now, to say the least, it stretches credibility to ask us to think his being seen with her (and often, too) in public  won't blow his cover. Not only that, but what if she were one of the moles for the mob? And indeed, one is led to think this at one point when she calls the mob king-pin on a cell phone. There is even a hint that the king-pin himself is a mole for the police, and another that leads you to think the chief of the state troopers (Sheen's character) is undercover for the mob.    If you like Mafia-like crime movies with lots of graphic violence, you might like this movie just for the gore; but don't pay to see it. I'm glad I didn't - it was only loaned to me.    P.S. I still don't know where the title came from.
1401307787|5.0|For those of us who suffer from stress and anxiety thanks either to simple, everyday living or a one-time, traumatic event, Jon Kabat-Zinn offers a meditative approach called mindfulness. Based on his  work in a stress clinic he founded at UMass medical center 30 years ago, mindfulness offers an entry into full wakefulness and focus that seems achievable through practice and dedication.  The book itself is terrifically gentle and his prose evenhanded and engaging.  There are tapes which offer meditative exercises based on the text, too.

B000I2JKD8|4.0|While my kids love this movie, I personally think this Scooby-doo is a pretty fair movie.  I was surprised to see a sequel, but in reality Scooby-Doo 2 is a better movie.  Given that the movie is just ok, the HD DVD presentation is fantastic!!  The image on the HD DVD is nothing short of outstanding.  The movie has a great transfer and the colors just pop off the screen.  While this is great and all but in some points this can be a bad thing and a little scary as Pamela Anderson can be seen in all her flaws!!!  As can Freddy Prince Jr.'s bad acting, but you can overlook all that when you see the image. <br /> <br />The audio on this disc is also delightful.  It makes full use of the surround channels and actually makes watching the movie bearable.  The mix is wonderful and very well balanced. <br /> <br />Supplements include a couple commentaries which I turned off after a few minutes and a 22 minute promo video. <br /> <br />This disc is one of those examples of a movie that is just ok and you probably wouldn't buy under normal circumstances, but it just looks and sounds so good you just have to buy it to show off what HD DVD can do.  Also if you have kids under 10 years of age they will thank you for it.
006112429X|3.0|It's hard to review this book when I am so appalled at what it represents. I appreciate the author's attempt to get into the whys and wherefores of teenage mass murderers, but I'm not sure the book deserves the attention it's gotten. While it definitely presents the story behind one such (fictional) criminal, I don't believe that Kevin's story is every school shooter's story.  <br /> <br />I think the relationship between mother and son (a son trying desperately to get a reaction from a mother who not only was ambivalent about his birth, but doesn't like him as a child either) is overshadowed by the horrific detals of the larger story. The nuances of the relationship -- and the truths about how far a child will go to gain his parents' attention -- are lost in the carnage. <br /> <br />A sidenote on the writing -- I dislike having to work so hard to read a book. I have trouble believing that an ordinary reader made it through this novel without a dictionary in hand. What's with the convoluted sentence structure and made-up words, and why did the author insist on using phrases such as \\"lambent joy,\\" \\"\\"immediate rapacities,\\" and \\"alien argot?\\" And this, from a woman who supposedly wrote travel guides aimed at the average college student? I think not.  <br /> <br />All in all, a gripping story, but the sensationalism of the crime obscures the deeper, more accessible meaning.
0393327655|5.0|This book is an intellectual tour de force. Its chapters may be read individually as stimulating lectures or as part of Harris's whole thesis on the role of scriptural faith in the problems of today's world. You do not have to accept his conclusions to benefit from this book. All of the logic is impeccable, compelling and effective, and each important reference is well documented. Some of his conclusions strike home with all the impact of a brick through a plate-glass window, while others are exquisitely complex existential exercises. If you accept any of his major conclusions this book will change your world view. If you are an observant Christian, Jew or Muslim, you will find this book challenges some of your core concepts. If you have a shred of intellectual honesty, however, you will think carefully about his arguments and weigh the evidence thoughtfully.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This film pokes fun at good old fashioned American College campus antics. Gone are the good old days. Not really, you can relive them in this outrageous film. Tim Matheson is a standout and his career has never got the recognition it deserved. Matheson's cool aplomb really makes this film work along with Elmer Bernstein's score doing a somewhat self parody especially on his own swashbuckling THE BUCCANEER score with John Belush's antics during the parade.
0440237688|4.0|This is a solid good book. Not great and not terrible, just good. It's a Utopian story like 1984, but for a younger audience. Both books warn us about utopias and teach that an 'imperfect' society is better than a 'perfect one. Without freedom and choice, life's not worth living.<br /><br />This book also manages to be very original in its ideas. I find the idea of one person carrying memories of the old world amazing. Middle schoolers will like this too, which I guess is prbably why they assign this in middle schools.<br /><br />Basically, it's a good book with neet ideas and exellent morals.

B000FZET5W|4.0|Because of the two principals, this session is likely to receive ongoing reincarnations, never going out of print.  But the title is somewhat deceptive.  Rollins and Monk play together on 3 of the 5 tracks on the album, which comprises three separate recording sessions held between Nov. 1953 and Sept. 1954.  Moreover, on \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" Monk plays a mere half chorus, and in a fairly conventional bebop style at that.  This leaves two tunes, \\"I Want to Be Happy\\" and \\"Friday the 13th,\\" on which the two inimitable soloists contrast and complement one another's strong musical personalities.<br /><br />The proceedings are enjoyable, frequently original and illuminating, but not as telepathic, or even miraculous, as some reviewers have described them.  It's instructive to hear the \\"real\\" Monk emerge on \\"Happy,\\" allowing the beat to establish itself before playing off of and around it, making the piano another polyrhythmic, percussive voice as opposed to a solo voice accompanied by rhythm section or a member of the accompanying team itself (these latter two roles characterizing his work on \\"Way You Look\\").<br /><br />Still, I'm afraid that after hearing the Monk and Coltrane Carnegie Hall concert, this one is anticlimactic, sonically as well as musically.  Moreover, Rollins, though bearing some of the same melodic-rhythmic qualities of his successor Charlie Rouse, lacks the light articulations and responsive quickness of the underrated Rouse.  Compared to Rouse's sportive playfulness, Rollins sounds somewhat heavy and ponderous to me in Monk country.  Coltrane's intensity meshes better with Monk whimsy because the piano serves as both ground and foil to the altissimo, rapturous flights of the tenor saxophone, as though Monk's solid harmonies are the falconer around which the falcon's spiraling harmonies are free to expend themselves without spinning out of control.<br /><br />Blakey and Monk, both of whom are heard here, always made for an engaging rhythmic pairing, but this session leaves you wanting to hear more.  An unfortunately overlooked recording (perhaps because it was on the \\"wrong\\" label) is \\"Thelonious Monk with Art Blakey\\" (Atlantic, 1957), which also features excellent trumpet work by the sadly underrecorded Bill Hardman.  It's a fascinatiing duel between two equally strong-minded music-shapers, and though Blakey delivers his brand of overwhelming firepower, Monk doesn't yield an inch--in fact, both players emerge as winners but not before a Titanic struggle.aves you wanting to hear more.

B000GFLAI0|4.0|The effort seems a bit like a continuation of Love and Theft.  Similar old timey feel, similar borrowing of genres.  Love and Theft, however, is a much better record.  Better tunes and better wordplay overall.  I believe Love and Theft is one of the Masterpieces of modern popular music.  Modern Times is merely one of the best records made in the last 5 years.   <br /> <br /> <br />

B000M5AJQI|5.0|I buy about 3-7 products from amazon a week (mostly movies, books, and videogames)and I very rarely write reviews. So when I do take the time to write a review that purchase had to have been blockbuster. And that is what this movie is, A BLOCKBUSTER!!! This movie is instantly one of my top 10 and the best movie of the year. I heard people talk about it when it was in the theater but im not a theater person, I usually wait for movies to be released for home viewing (I prefer my 6.1 surround sound and 1080p monitor). I dont want to say anything to spoil any part of this movie because it was FLAWLESS from beginning to end. In closing get this movie, AMAZING PLOT, ACTING, SCRIPT, EVEN THE SCORE WAS GREAT!!!

1582701709|3.0|The Science of Mind was written in 1926 and revised in 1938 by Earnest Holmes and it details the function of mind in this universe and how to use that function for the betterment of yourself and others. The Secret is the same basic thing updated and in a different format.<br /><br />I just bought the book and gave it to my wife, so I haven't fuly digested it, but my first look gave me the impression that it is essentially Science of Mind 'lite'.<br /><br />Note: The message in any of these books (Shakti Gawain's: Creative Visualization ex.)is profound. You create your own reality. I believe that and many people do, certainly successful people do. T Harv Ecker uses much of this philosophy in his book The secrets of the millionaire mind.<br /><br />Let me just say that while I find this message empowering and uplifting I absolutely hate the format of The Secret (the book). It is all chopped up and spread out with bits, bullet points, quotes, slogans and take away pieces of information. It reads like a medley. It never forms a cohesion of thoughts to allow for a communion with the author.<br /><br />I much prefer a deeper experience and a richer text. For those that like reading and get excited about digging deeper, then The Science of Mind delivers on a much higher plane.<br /><br />If you like your reading 'lite' and would prefer to just get the reading part out of the way as quickly as possible then The Secret will be much more up your alley.

B000CNE092|5.0|I bought this in stores some time last year (I believe in April) and was ecstatic to have actually found the movie. I originally received th VHS version back in April of 1998 and had almost worn my tape out from watching the movie so much. I happened to think \\"I wonder if I can find Anastasia on DVD\\" and at that moment was passing by the only copy in the store. <br /> <br />The movie is great, but not historically accurate. It's a kid's movie, not a history lesson, so keep that in mind if you plan to purchase this. I won't summarize the story but I will say that this movie is easily my Favorite 2D animated movie. Fox did a beautiful job on this and even almost 10 years later I am greatly in love with this movie. <br /> <br />The DVD set contains 2 Discs and has a lovely menu. The only thing that isn't beautiful is the cover which is a hideous malnourished rendering of Anastasia. The original cover was so much better, but as I still have the VHS it's not that much of a bother to me. This DVD also features the straight to video/DVD release of Bartok the Magnificent. It's a very cute movie which revolves around the adorable bat character from the original and has a cute lesson to be learned. Also the bear is voiced by the same guy who voiced Vlad in the movie (I can't remember his name). He's a great singer which just adds to the movie. <br /> <br />A definite recommendation to buy for your children or yourself. It's actually kind of sad to see the 3D dominated world of animation, so it's great that movies like these are still so popular.

B000M06K5C|5.0|\\"Side Note: I'd have given this 4.5 stars if Amazon had let me.\\" <br /> <br />Bloc Party became one of my favorite bands after Silent Alarm came out.  I don't like a lot of the other \\"Dance Rock\\" or guitar driven new UK bands like the Killers, Franz Ferdinand, etc.  I thought Bloc Party sounded edgier, with more attention to musical details, guitar lines, harmony, and arrangements than these other bands and had more of the goods to back up the cocky pseudo-punk rock attitude.   <br /> <br />Well, they still do.  This album is a bit more varied than Silent Alarm.  I think the lyrics are overall better, and the first half of the album is absolutely gang-busters.  \\"Song For Clay\\", \\"Waiting for the 7:18\\", and \\"Where Is Home?\\" are among their very best.  \\"The Prayer\\" is definitely a cool experiment, but not quite as moving.  There is a more electronic feel to this one, and the drumming of Matt Tong has obviously been supplemented with loops.  The second half of the album kind of fails to consistently inspire, but this is still a really strong album and worth your duckets.  I think overall, they may have overthought this album, but I think it's still one of the 10 best you're going to hear this year.

His four agreements reminded me of the Seth Speaks books, and applied similar messages imparted in the universal laws of attraction, belief, and pure desire. Much like \\"The Law of Attraction,\\" by Michael Rann, this book uses a mechanism of channeling, in this case dreams and visions, to share a wisdom presumably from a supernatural source. Bottom line: keep your chin up, be an honorable person, and persist in your efforts to improve yourself. <br /> <br />If you are interested in books related to financial success, you may want to read anything in the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series by Mike Kiyosaki, or you may want to try \\"The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,\\" by Phillip Collinsworth.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|There were and are a few grumblings from critics here and there but ultimately this film garnered near unanimous applause and a huge sigh of relief. Batman Begins is not perfect by any measure but is easily the best Batman movie ever, not that it had serious competition from it's predecessors. The first thing director Christopher Nolan does is say the hell with the neon colors, the over the top comic book sensibility, the freakshow circuses, let's take Batman back to his roots. Strip him of all the tarnish and the villians and the crazy gadgets. Let's go to the core of who he is. Who is Batman? Who is Bruce Wayne? How did Bruce Wayne become Batman? Everyone knows the answers to these questions but we never saw these questions answered vividly before our very eyes on the cinematic screen before Batman Begins. One of the genius strokes of this movie is the fact that Batman is not even shown onscreen for the first hour of the film! Unbelievable! That had to have Warner Brothers executives biting their fingernails incessantly. Will those pesky teenagers in the audience sit still as the story of Batman is allowed to unfold at an unhurried pace? Apparently those pesky teenagers weren't so dumb after all since the film was quite a hit. Hey, even adults liked this movie, two birds with one stone.  <br /> <br />Christian Bale is the best actor to inhabit this character, ever. Some may have their nostalgia for Michael Keaton but Keaton was very low-key and let the freakshow villians dominate his movies with their antics. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman is a marked difference from previous actors, he is involving and fascinating as a character. From the tragedy of his past to the glory of his future, the whole path of this character makes perfect dramatic sense. Michael Caine does his job as Alfred, Liam Neeson is an intelligent villian, Cillian Murphy gets a bit on my nerves, but anyhow, the only person who lets the cast down is Katie Holmes. She's just there to be a pretty face and she's not that pretty! Gary Oldman as Gordan is right on the money. Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson and even Rutger Hauer are terrific supporting characters. Ken Watanabe's short appearance is significant too. That's a lot of name actors!  <br /> <br />The script and pacing are terrific, however Batman Begins does have it's faults. Let me list them. There seems to be too many characters and plot points as if Nolan wants to ram a far more epic story into the running time. Then there is the question of the action scenes, Nolan's directing of action is still in it's infancy and there is no action set-piece to take your breath away and go, \\"Wow, that's amazing!\\". So the action scenes leave something to be desired and the Batmobile looks like [...] to be honest, but it's design makes sense in light of Nolan's more realistic take on the whole Batman mythology. ( The Batmobile still looks very derivative, admit it! ).  <br /> <br />Overall, this film was a joy to watch. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen and was very happy to finally be witness to the Batman film we all rightfully deserved. In light of the box-office victory and the critical triumph, this film should not have been called Batman Begins, but instead Batman Redeemed! <br /> <br />
B000001G1E|5.0|This is as close to a complete retrospective of James Brown's legendary recording career from 1956-1984 that will ever be available. The 71 tracks are from original session tapes or the original single and album masters. The sound quality - in particular on the oldest material - is outstanding.<br /><br />The collection starts with Please, Please, Please (1956) and ends with Unity (Part I), which features Afrika Bambaata on co-vocals.<br /><br />Some of my favorites are Try Me, Night Train, Papa's Got A Brand New Bag (Parts I, II & III), Bring It Up (Hipster's Avenue), Say It Loud - I'm Black And I'm Proud (Part I), Funky Drummer, Make It Funky (Part I), King Heroin and My Thang.<br /><br />Along with bassist Bootsy Collins, Brown has worked with many dynamite musicians, led by long-time organist, Bobby Byrd. The saxophonists include Maceo Parker, Pee Wee Ellis, Michael Brecker & Joe Farrell, with such trombonists as Randy Brecker, Fred Wesley & Jon Faddis bolstering Brown's signature Funk and R&B sounds.<br /><br />You can count on one hand the true pathfinders in American popular music. There are three individuals who must be on every list; Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis and The Godfather of Soul.
B00004XPPK|5.0|This movie has it all- great acting, great plot and the most sensual strip tease in a movie ever, even though Gilda just takes her glove off. <br />Rita Heyworth's best perfomance ever and she was never able o top it.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|I kid you not, this one delivers the goods and then some! The Departed is a remake of Infernal Affairs (2002), an excellent Hong Kong crime film. This is one of the rare times where a remake surpasses the original, actually improving on it. I love the way screenwriter Monahan adapted the script for Boston; it flows perfectly and makes all the sense in the world. Nicholson's character, Frank Costello, was modeled after James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, the biggest gangster there ever was in Boston (still #2 on the FBI's most wanted list). A lot of what's going on is very plausible; after all, Scorsese is an expert on the subject, having grown in the mean streets of New York as a kid.<br /><br />I won't go over the details of the plot as I'm sure by now you know what the film's about (crook (Damon) graduates from police academy to infiltrate cops and cop (DiCaprio) passes for a crook to infiltrate crooks). Damon and DiCaprio give some of the best performances of their career. Nicholson is awesome as usual, but even better in the sense that he pushes the envelope and plays a character that is more than just Jack being Jack. Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin all turn in stellar performances. If you're a fan of Scorsese, by now you're familiar with his seventies selections for backgroung music; tradition he keeps here (plus a song from the Dropkick Murphys, \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\"). The cinematography is beautiful, as in all other Scorsese films. The editing is tight and the direction, well, it's Scorsese, so it's flawless, what did you expect?<br /><br />As for the special features disc, it kicks butt and takes names. Three very interesting documentaries (including Scorsese on Scorsese, an 85 minute sit-down with the man himself; worth the price of admission alone) and some deleted scenes. So if you're wondering whether you should spend the extra bucks for the 2-disc edition, go for it, it's well worth it.<br /><br />Not since Goodfellas has a Scorsese film been so powerful and so riveting. With its mix of ghoulish humor and excessive violence, The Departed is destined to become a crime classic, joining the ranks of the afore-mentioned Goodfellas, Godfather saga, Scarface, and Heat. If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for, laddie? Get yourself a copy of this powerhouse of a movie. Come Oscar time, Marty deserves to get a little statuette at long last!een so powerful and so riveting.

0307237699|5.0|It's a lose-lose situation for even the legislators with honorable intentions - which, according to U.S. Senator Barak Obama, most of them actually are!<br /><br />The possibility of conceiving, developing, writing and passing `clean' legislation is, because of the nature of the process itself, fundamentally not permitted. As bills move along, things get added in and subtracted out by other players and interests so that the final product is NEVER the straight-forward, clean, single-targeted notion that drove it at inception. This leaves legislators in the position of  either voting NO on bills on the basis on which they can later be legitimately faulted for having voted against something that was `good,' or voting YES on bills on which they can be equally faulted, after the fact, for having not voted against something `bad.'  All legislation is, in this way, imperfect and corrupted - just like the people and process from whence it is created. It's a no-win situation.  A sausage factory at it's worse.<br /><br />And yet, through the pages of this book, rather than conveying a dark cloud of desperate fatality, Obama writes about a spirit of honest, self-reflective (and, at times, even self deprecating) hopefulness that begins with the recognition that there are things that are wrong.  I found this book to be a truly uncommon piece of political exposition.<br /><br />The timing, published as it was prior to the Democrats gaining control of both Houses of Congress in the past year, causes it to have been written from the minority point of view.<br /><br />There is a lot of attention paid in the press to Barak Obama is; his racial, ethnic, religious and socio-economic background.  While he does address and discuss each of these things in this book, also in what comes across as being an honest and straightforward way,  I will not dwell on them here because I believe they are less important than what he has to tell us about the nature of  the political/legislative processes in this country and about the  required attitude that would allow for the possibility - as unlikely as it might seem to the more cynically inclined among us - of positive and constructive change of our own arguably corrupted system.<br /><br />While he is admittedly and proudly a liberal Democrat, this book is really not the partisan treatise that some might write it off as being, especially since he has subsequently declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency in 2008.  It's not about Democrats and it's not about Republicans, Greens, Independents or any particular political set of beliefs and values. It's about the nature of what has become of a structural political idea, designed as a profound alternative to 18th Century monarchist rule, and it's evolution over the past couple of centuries.  Some has evolved well - and some has become a part of what we might all agree is the `problem.'  In this book, Obama gives the reader a thoughtful, honest review of what seems to work about it and what needs attention.  All Americans, whatever their political affiliations or preferences, should be interested in what Obama has to say, because ultimately the book is less about promoting a specific ideology than it is about promoting an attitude - an audacious attitude, if you will,  - in the face of all that has gone before us, of HOPE.<br /><br />After all, we know that in a situation where a person or a people believe that change is not possible, it is simply impossible for change to occur. Change starts with the beliefs that 1) things need to change and that 2) they can.  This is Mr. Obama's point and hope; This is my hope and needs to be everyone's if we are to leave our children and grandchildren an improved version of what we Americans have worked so hard for the past 230 years to develop and sustain. A Republic predicated on the idea of democracy.<br /><br />This is not a Frank Capra film, with fragments of political truisms woven into a primary fiber of melodrama or star vehicle: this is a slice of real political life from the perspective of a relatively untarnished eyes of one of our newer United States Senators - one with ambition for certain, but one with humanity, dignity and self-reflective honesty not commonly seen amongst his seniors. For both students of government and devotes of hope, this is a necessary readry fiber of melodrama or star vehicle: this is a slice of real political life from the perspective of a relatively untarnished eyes of one of our newer United States Senators - one with ambition for certain, but one with humanity, dignity and self-reflective honesty not commonly seen amongst his seniors.

B00000JHAU|4.0|In my review of Belle & Sebastian's CD The Boy With the Arab Strap, I described the 1996 release If You're Feeling Sinister as the \\"better\\" album.  I think that I was pretty much going along with the conventional wisdom that holds this to be true.  At this point, however, I am not sure that I agree with this assessment. I am not now claiming that The Boy With the Arab Strap is better one, just that it is not by any means necessarily the lesser one.  So to split the difference, let us say that they are equally good.  Interestingly, about as many would disagree with this as would agree with it.  I read a review of their 2006 CD The Life Pursuit which claimed that the band never fully capitalized on the momentum they developed with If You're Feeling Sinister.  Granted, their 2000 and 2002 albums showed a sharp decline in the quaility of the band's output. However, to discount The Boy With the Arab Strap and 2003's Dear Catastrophe Waitress as subpar efforts is simply ludicrous.<br /><br />Anyway, If You're Feeling Sinister was the band's first record to be given wide release, and was therefore the one which introduced the lucky few to the elements that have made Belle & Sebastian the beloved cult band that they have been ever since.  Those with only a passing knowledge of Belle & Sebastian might be inclined to associate them with slow and pensive songs. These are indeed an essential part of their reportoire, as demonstrated on this album by \\"The Stars of Track and Field\\", \\"The Fox In the Snow\\", \\"The Boy Done Wrong Again\\", and \\"Judy and the Dream of Horses\\". (These titles themselves are indicitive of the whimsy that is also invitably - and rightly - associated with the band.)  However, the band ventures just as naturally into uptempo territory on \\"Seeing Other People\\", \\"Me and the Major\\", the title track, and \\"Mayfly\\".  This contrast keeps the record from sounding too much like a collection of bedtime stories, even though IYFS is less dynamic than some of their other records.<br /><br />When I first heard \\"Me and the Major\\", I mistook those words as \\"me and the midget\\". Thus, I misheard one of the lyrics as \\"Me and the midget don't see eye to eye\\".  While this was a humorous mistake, it made sense to me that such a lyric would come from Belle & Sebastian, as they are quite keen with their word play and verbal imagery, eg, \\"She was into S&M and Bible studies\\". Musically, Belle & Sebastian's sound is based primarily on strings and delicate acoustic guitars, to the almost complete exclusion of electric guitars.  This combination is decorated by non-traditional pop instruments such as harmonica, trumpet, and saxaphone.  The band uses these to full effect without making the songs sound like exercises in the genres more commonly associated with these instruments. This sound - along with the lyrics - deliberately invoke melancholy.  In fact, the last two songs on the album refer to someone writing or wanting to write \\"the saddest song\\".  And as lead singer/songwriter Stuart Murdoch sings on \\"Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying\\", \\"I could kill you sure/But I can only make you cry with these words\\".<br /><br />But still, as I said in my review of The Boy With the Arab Strap, Belle & Sebatian's music is much more life-affirming than it is depressing. Moreover, Stuart Murdoch is not as brooding or woe-is-me as say, Morrissey.  Having gotten in B&S in a somewhat backward fashion (I heard Dear Catastrophe Waitress before anything else), I missed the female vocals present on later albums but absent from IYFS.  This does not make it a lesser album, but rather, it helps keep other releases from sounding too much like it.  Thus, IYFS was a fine springboard for future ideas from Belle & Sebastian, and it is every bit as good as - but not better than - anything the group has ever recorded.When I first heard \\"Me and the Major\\", I mistook those words as \\"me and the midget\\".

B00003CXC7|5.0|Of all the movies that Hitchcock directed this is the best one.  The plot is captivating, the casting superb but the directing is unique. You actually think that you are part of the set and feel the mercury rising. A masterpiece
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Many of the songs on 'Funeral' have an elegant, almost archaic feel that's truly beatiful to absorb. 'Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels),' 'une annee sans lumiere,' 'Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)' and 'Wake Up' are each filled with warm sounds and truly sensitive feelings behind the words. 'Funeral' is a stately concept album in the sense that the band named it in honor of several relatives and friends who passed away during its creation - thus, the respectful feel of the album, right down to the funeral-designed brochure tucked inside the ultra-slim CD package.<br /><br />Arcade Fire is a diverse-sounding band that can change its stripes at the drop of a hat, from elegies to rock to dance to songs with an ethnic flair. The list of instruments used on 'Funeral' - besides the typical guitar, drums and bass - is striking, and adds to the creative vibe that the CD radiates: piano, xylophone, violin, recorders, accordian, rickenbacker are just several unique instruments on the list. At times I hear remnants of the Talking Heads (see [[ASIN:B0002IQMKM The Best of Talking Heads]]) in such songs as 'Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)', but overall, Arcade Fire is definitely its own unique musical monster.<br /><br />The best song on 'Funeral' is also the most unexpected, sonically speaking. 'Rebellion (Lies)' is nothing like its more reverent bretheren on the CD. At its core, this song is pure feel-good pop, with slightly disconcerting lyrics to boot. (The 'Lies!' shriek at the tail end of the chorus is priceless.) I discovered Arcade Fire through this song, though it took me months to find out the band's actual name. Perhaps the coolest portion of 'Funeral' occurs when the salsa-tinged 'Haiti' slowly melds into 'Rebellion,' with nothing more than an ardent kick drum, a squealing guitar and a lingering synth. The mysterious intro to the song is par for the course on an album that itself holds some persistent mysteriousness throughout.

B000M4RG42|5.0|With Flags Of Our Fathers receiving so many negative reviews, I hesitated in buying the DVD.  Still, I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director, plus I love movies about World War II.  I purchased the film and found myself really liking it.  I was surprised.  Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting big things to happen.  Anyway, I had no trouble with the flash-backs, or the character development, or the fact that the battle for Iwo Jima wasn't covered as heavily as was the effort to raise money with the rallies for War Bonds.  I had no problem following the movie and was caught up in it within the first few minutes.  I thought the performances were excellent by all three of the main actors (Jesse Bradford, Ryan Phillippe and Adam Beach), and that Clint Eastwood did a marvelous job of conveying the fact that war is hell and that no soldier goes untouched by what he or she experiences.  In fact, the movie made me feel sad for what the real-life soldiers--John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes--had to go through once the war was over.  One day you're a celebrity, then the next day no one wants to return your phone calls.  I have nothing bad to say about Flags Of Our Fathers.  I really enjoyed this movie and look forward to seeing Letters From Iwo Jima when it comes out on DVD in a few months.  As far as extras go, there are none on this DVD.  If you want to buy it, my suggestion would be to wait for the Director's Cut, or the Special Two-disc Collector's Edition, to come out some time in the next couple of months.  Mr. Eastwood always does a Special Edition of his Oscar nominated films.  Though I'll always see Clint Eastwood as his most famous character, \\"Dirty\\" Harry Callahan, I have to admit to being extremely pleased with how he's done as a director.  This is one man who'll always make your day, if you give him the opportunity.  A great film maker with a great story to tell!

B000669GAI|4.0|I bought this 2CD set upon its release in December 2004 because I had wanted to collect Pearl Jam songs I'd liked back in the 1990's, and up to that point, I owned none of their music. Many of the hits on here weren't played on the radio stations I was listening to at the time, so a lot of this music was new to me. I'm rating this 4 stars because it is a well-compiled collection of 33 songs that should appeal to non-core fans like myself who don't own all of Pearl Jam's studio albums, but who like  many of their songs. Pearl Jam is a great rock band, they write intelligent lyrical songs, and the guitar, bass and drum players create thunderous power on many of their strong songs. <br /> <br />Best songs in my opinion: Immortality, I Got ID, Given To Fly, Not For You, I Am Mine, Even Flow, Once, and especially the awesome song Jeremy - one of the most powerful songs of the decade and despite its chilling subject matter, my favourite song of theirs .
B000GTJT16|2.0|The photography of Sleepy Hollow is absolutely stunning. Emmanual Lubezki received a well-deserved Academy Award for it. Naturally, my expectations for this HD-DVD were quite high... <br /> <br />The source material seemed to be in good shape in every aspect, BUT: <br /> <br />The biggest issue I have with the picture quality is the heavy use of a digital noise reduction filter. This filter not only introduces terrible blocking artifacts but also kills image details - something you don't want to do with a hi-def format!  <br /> <br />Apparently someone thought the film looks too grainy... Let me get this straight: IT IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK GRAINY due to the fast film stocks used in low light situations and the \\"bleach bypass\\" process used in the lab to achieve the gritty, desaturated high-contrast look. <br /> <br />Other HD-DVDs have shown that the VC-1 compression technology is perfectly  capable of preserving even high amounts of film grain (e.g. \\"Dune\\", \\"Casino\\") and therefore a very natural, film-like image. For a film with a running time of 105 minutes the use of any digital \\"grain reduction\\" is simply unnecessary and stupid. <br /> <br />As a result \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" looks very processed and artificial (in a digital kind of way) from start to finish. <br /> <br />After watching 10 HD-DVDs this is the first one I'm really disappointed with.  <br /> <br />Picture Quality Rating: 2/5 (below average)
B000INAXGU|5.0|British band Jamiroquai here are represented by 19 songs , 2 of which are new recordings and the other 17 were single releases from 1992-2006 . Jamiroquai is one of my favourite bands, and have so many good songs on their 6 albums to date. I really like singles collections like this with punchier single-edit versions of hits instead of the usually-longer album versions. The songs are groovy, well-produced, fun and with terrific lyrics. There is a sense of social and environmental conscience here courtesy of Jamiroquai leader Jay Kay's strongly-stated views on the ecology, but at the same time a glittery pop/dance vibe with 70's funk influences that I really like on many songs.  <br /> <br />This then gets 5 stars from me for reproducing all those High Times I've had with Jamiroquai's music since first hearing them when I was at university back in 1993.  <br /> <br />Best tracks in my opinion: <br />Love Foolosophy - one of my favourite dance records of the 2000's so far <br />Cosmic Girl - Groovy sci-fi dance record ! <br />Don't Give Hate A Chance - awesome number with positive message  <br />When You Gonna Learn - Yes everybody, when ?! You have been warned ! <br />Alright - another dance groove , this one from 1997  <br />Seven Days In Sunny June - Great song from the Dynamite CD  <br /> <br />Really though , everything on here is good. <br /> <br />Try this CD out . Highly Recommended and lots of fun. <br />
B00007LTIA|5.0|Yes' music seems so often to get caught up in the meta \\"prog is too pompous and long\\" debate, and for some reason Tales from Topographic Oceans always seems to take the brunt of the heat, and any review of it spends most of its time putting down and debating the theoretical nature of prog--snooze!  I'm not sure why--maybe because it's their longest album, and maybe because it has consistently the longest songs of any Yes record.  Well, I'm not here to get into an argument about pretentiousness or insert myself into the directionless argument about Yes' relationship with classical music.  I'd rather spend my review space relating why I like this record, why I think it's good, and why I think it's worth your money and listening time.<br /><br />Tales starts out just like the title and classic album art would lead you to expect--it sounds like you're slowly becoming submerged beneath the water, to emerge in an entirely new landscape created by the band's sound.  I love it already.  As Howe's volume-modulated guitar lines foreshadow one of the song's main themes, Anderson's vocals begin in a sort of recitation/chant style never before heard on a Yes album.  It's stuff like this that really endears me to Tales--it's full of a lot of really great ideas that give it a character apart from other Yes releases.  The chant builds to a crescendo, Alan White hammers out one of the wonkiest, most transcendently off-kilter fills of his life, and Wakeman's moog explodes.  Welcome to the ocean.  The first track is typified by some ridiculously inventive guitar from the typically impressive Steve Howe (I can't believe that one reviewer hates his guitar tone), some great movements that evoke at times an almost hoedown-like atmosphere, and later a church music atmosphere, and some of Jon Anderson's most memorable lyrics.  Although history says that Wakeman wasn't really excited about this project, I think he still manages to inject some of his trademark flair with some excellent moog solos.<br /><br />\\"The Remembering\\" is more stately than the opener--more dominated by acoustic textures and a more old-timey English folk feel.  It opens with a cheery keyboard doodle and a later part includes some great acoustic work from Steve Howe, as well as the memorable \\"Relayer\\" section.  Out of all the tracks on Tales, I'd probably say it's the least striking, but it also offers quite a bit on repeated listens, and contains more stylistic diversity than other tracks.<br /><br />\\"The Ancient\\" contains what I think is some of the coolest experimentation on the album, with a grooving, alien-sounding intro and some of Steve Howe's most out-there guitar, followed by some music that bears some similarity to the original music from the [[ASIN:B00000DGXX A Clockwork Orange]] soundtrack.  Eventually the jerky meter changes give way to one of Steve Howe's most pastoral and pleasant fingerstyle acoustic compositions (love the soundboard tapping), which blends effortlessly with Jon Anderson's message of peace.<br /><br />\\"Ritual,\\" the sprawling closer starts out with a bang, blending a wordless vocal line with a great romping instrumental theme.  Out of the four tracks, I think \\"Ritual\\" assembles the most musical thematic recurrence from other songs (is the music really that different from classical?), which does detract from its unique character a bit, but strengthens the album's cohesion on a higher level.  Some reviewers have found the percussion interlude unlistenable, but I'm of the school that experimentation can be good, and I really dig its abrasive texture.  The mood drops down as Anderson sums up his oblique religious message (I never put too much stock in his \\"message,\\" though I do love his voice and think his indirect lyrics can often conjure up some great images), then the band kicks back in for a roaring minor-key reconstitution of the album's first theme to close the album.<br /><br />Yeah, it's sprawling, and it's also difficult to get into in one listen.  To me, that's a boon--there's plenty to get to know, appreciate, and love upon multiple repeated listens.  Every time I listen to this album I find new reasons to appreciate its soaring beauty, technical wizardry, and inventiveness.  Please, leave the prog debate aside and check out Tales from Topographic Oceans--it's a gorgeous project full of classic moments, often wildly successful experimentation, and overall, it's a really great journey across some dramatic topography.nty to get to know, appreciate, and love upon multiple repeated listens.

B0001Z2RUK|4.0|I would like to plug this 2004 CD by British band Keane: Hopes And Fears. It is a tuneful album of well-made songs enlivened by the distictive melodic voice of singer Tom Chaplin, augmented by a very well-produced instrumental sound. The overall effect of these 11 songs is entrancing and enjoyable. I particularly like the song This Is The Last Time, and was moved to buy this CD by lead single Somewhere Only I Know, which I only heard once and immediately liked. Unlike other bands in the 80s and 90s that I discovered by radio, I learned about Keane via DVD footage of them on UK TV and MTV exposure, so I am unsure how successful they are or if they have been out touring. I haven't heard any other records by them as yet. <br /> <br />I'm giving this one 4 stars. <br />Recommended

When my ex and I went and picked up my mother and grandmother and I forgot to take the CD out of my car but my ex and I was in a hurry because we were like 2 hours late and when my car was started and then the song called \\"Believe\\" started playing and I had to turn the music off quickly and my mother told me that she wanted to hear it so I left it on and grandmother said and asked: This song is very good who was it? and I said it was Cher and we all 3 talked about Cher's daughter being gay and my family loves Cher as much as I love Cher!! Very very sad story of my life with me and my family. I love you Cher and my family and friends and thank you all for being there for me and I cant thank you all enough for who I truly am!! LOVE YOU ALL!!!
B000025H0Q|5.0|first off let me praise the string arrangements by a fella named robert kirby that are amongst the most enjoyable i've heard on any pop/folk album. this album is almost sunny compared to the beautiful melancholy that prevades nick drake's other 2 masterpieces (five leaves left and pink moon, of course). bryter layter, the title track, is an instrumental that could just about fit on an antonio carlos jobim recording; buoyant spirited and fun. alto sax, viola, harpsichord, celeste, piano, flute and backing vocals all add to make this quite a different affair than the other drake recordings. l love all nick drake's work and each of the 3 albums that he made in his short lifetime are so spectacular it's hard to say which is my favorite. whatever one i'm listening to at the moment is almost always dearest to my heart. if you have yet to experience this great artist's music, just dive into it: on five leaves left, bryter layter, or pink moon, you can't go wrong.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|WOW!  I watched this movie in spite of the fact that I think Al Gore is a liberal socialist, egotistical, pompus, non-internet-inventing liar.  I didn't think I would discover the real cause of global warming from watching his pathetic movie. <br /> <br />BUT I WAS WRONG!  I discovered the real cause for global warming!!!  Every time Gore opens his FAT MOUTH, TONS of hot gas escape from that hole in his face. <br /> <br />The movie is very well named.  The truth is very inconvenient...for Mr. Gore.  That's why he leaves it out.  He left out the part about buying 'carbon credits' from a company that he owns stock in, so that he can say he isn't actually leaving a king king sized 'carbon footprint' by flying around in private jets and spending over $30,000 a year on mammoth electric and gas bills for his two huge mansions. <br /> <br />What a hypocrite!  Unfortunately there are so many of you Kool-Ade drinkers out there that even those facts won't get you to question what Gore says enough to look at any real facts.  Facts like...the SUN is getting hotter.  Which is making the earth warm...and...The earth has been through ice-ages and warming periods many times before we terrible polluting humans came along. <br /> <br />Climate change is just the latest left-wing liberal craze.  In the 70's global cooling was going to get us.  In the 80's I remember seeing Ted Danson and other wackos telling us that in 10 years the world's oceans would be dead and that would lead to our demise.  Now it's trans-fats and global warming that are gonna get us.  No threat from terrorists though. <br /> <br />For supposedly inventing the internet, you'd think that Al could do some better research. <br /> <br />I rate this movie a 4 Stars because I've not laughed so hard in a long time.  And really, who doesn't enjoy a good laugh now and then? <br /> <br />

6304366078|4.0|Grand Prix is really a great treat if you are a fan of Formula 1 and its history.  F1 in the 1960s was a mixture of changing technology (rear engines, alloy wheels versus wire, disc brakes versus drum) and cars that were little more than \\"coffins on wheels\\" as one of the characters in the film describes them. <br /> <br />The movie takes place after the change to 3-liter engines and includes some of the great tracks and even greater drivers of the era. James Garner is the main character, an American racing driver who has his own personality problems, not the least of which is his drive to win at any cost, even the life and limb of his team mate.  Yves Montand plays a French driver for Ferrari who is still skilled but tired of the grind of the Formula 1 circus.   <br /> <br />In the 1950s and 1960s it seemed that hardly a month went by without some highly talented driver getting killed.  Grand Prix weaves this thread of truth throughout the movie and lets us see why the races and cars were so dangerous.  Just watch the sequence at Spa Francorchamps and you will be amazed and/or horrified by how life threatening the tracks were compared to today.  The drivers bullet along at 180 mph on roads that have no guard rails, fans standing on the edge of the track and brick buildings 2 feet from the side of the car.  The Monza sequence is also thrilling to watch, sets you up for the tragedy that ensues. <br /> <br />This was an era of fearless men (and in Grand Prix, the women who loved them).  One of the treats of watching this film is the group of real Formula 1 drivers that are part of the cast.  Phil Hill (the American world champion for Ferrari in 1961), Graham Hill, Black Jack Brabham, Richie Ginther, Jochen Rhindt, and Dan Gurney are all here.  How cool it is to see them all acting out what must have been to them, their lives (at least as far as the racing part of their lives went).   <br /> <br />The story is fairly straightforward with much of the story telegraphed through dialogue and character.  One character pushes himself to be as good as his dead brother, which is impossible.  He is not loved as much as his dead sibling (a former world champion), is not as good at his craft and is unwilling to quit until he tames the sport or it kills him.   <br /> <br />There is a character that represents Enzo Ferrari, views inside the Ferrari factory, and comments that allude to the way Enzo pitted his drivers against each other and themselves to please him and to win.  They even call him Il Commendatore.     <br /> <br />The cinematography is beautiful and the DVD is a magnificent copy, with only a few film artifacts to detract from the show.  Frankenheimer is really good when he is showing the gritty side of things - the pits, the racing, the shift linkages and suspension movement, in other words the racing side of F1 racing at that time - away from all the glitz and glamour.  The romance that weaves its way through the movie slows things down a bit, but it is handled well.  In fact, now that I am of the advanced age of 44, the story holds together better than I remember it at age 10.   <br />

B0000714B5|3.0|No movie that is even marginally true to the story that Nobel Prize-winning German author Hermann Hesse told in his novel Siddhartha (1951) is without merit; and this modest film is no exception.  The problem is, that while Conrad Brooks, who wrote, directed and produced the film, is true to the storyline of the novel and even in some respects true to the spirit of the novel, he fails to bring the power and the resplendence of Hesse's philosophic and spiritual masterpiece to the screen.<br /><br />What made the novel one of the best ever written is the character of Siddhartha himself.  Patterned after the Buddha both in temperament and in experience, Hesse's Siddhartha, \\"the Accomplished One,\\" grew up amid extravagant wealth and privilege only to dump it all in an effort to find himself.  Brooks fails almost immediately when he leaves out the scene from the book in which the young Siddhartha, not wanting to directly disobey his father (and to demonstrate his resolve) stands up all night waiting patiently for his father's permission to leave their splendid estates.  This is one of the great \\"coming of age\\" scenes ever written and an early insight into Siddhartha's strength of character, but Brooks gives it barely a notice!<br /><br />Also skirted over too quickly are Siddhartha's years with the samanas in the forest where he practiced meditation and austerities.  This part of Siddhartha's life was essential in making him the man he was and in showing us his character.  He spent six years with the shamans and gurus of the forest (along with his companion Govinda) and in the end learned everything they knew and more, and yet had not found the answer he sought. (This parallels the experience of the \\"emaciated\\" Buddha.)<br /><br />Brooks does do the meeting with the Buddha well, having us hear his voice but not see him, and then follows that up with Siddhartha's reasons for not following the Buddha, even though he finds no fault with the Enlightened One's teachings.  Note that without his actually meeting the Buddha, the life of Siddhartha (which is one of the traditional names of the Buddha) would so closely parallel that of the Buddha that some people might think that Hesse had written a profane life of the Buddha, which might not set well with some Buddhists!  (Of course we all have the Buddha nature.)<br /><br />Siddhartha's life with the courtesan Kamala and the merchant Kamaswami and his spiral into debauchery and sloth is well depicted, although again the ultimate disillusionment that Siddhartha experienced is not as well presented as in the novel.  Which brings me to Shashi Kapoor who plays Siddhartha.  Although he would go on to be the veteran of well over a hundred films, and although he is appropriately enough Indian as well as tall, dark and handsome and a good actor, he fails to evoke the passion that Siddhartha must have.  Siddhartha felt everything in a profound manner, even boredom was profoundly experienced by the Brahmin's prodigal son.  Kapoor, especially near the end of the film when he plays an old man, occasionally made me feel that he could be \\"the Accomplished One,\\" but more often he made me feel that he was holding something back.<br /><br />Finally, the poetic scene near the end of the novel when, after living with and being guided by Vasudeva, the ferryman, Siddhartha becomes one with the river and falls spiritually into its wisdom, is only a bland shadow of what appears in the novel!<br /><br />Part of the reason for the failure probably has to do with a limited budget.  The film is 83 minutes long, but could easily be twice that long.  Part has to do with the selection of scenes and the emphasis on those scenes, and finally part of the reason has to do with the relative inexperience of Brooks who was only directing his second major film (and apparently his last).  Certainly the on-location in India cinematography by Sven Nykvist who worked on so many films with Ingmar Berman is not to be faulted.  Although not spectacular, Nykvist's camera conveys both the exotic beauty and the poverty of a landscape that could have been India 26 centuries ago.ulted.

B000F7CMRM|3.0|This is a stylish-looking intrigue thriller evocative of sound bites and headlines from the Middle East near the beginning of the 21st century.  Based loosely on CIA operative Robert Baer's memoir, See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Solder in the CIA's War on Terrorism (2003), the main point of the movie seems to be that our need for oil compromised our efforts to stop terrorism. Or another way to look at this is to say that the CIA and the US government in general failed to make an effective transition from Cold War intelligence operations to the so-called War on Terror.<br /><br />Oil companies conspiring to increase supply and profits, Arabian princes vying to become the next emir, CIA agents sleuthing in dangerous lands, board meetings and cocktail parties with wealthy and influential international players, bombs going off, fear and torture, and a very nice precision rocket launch in the desert to hit exactly the fourth car in a queue are featured.  Unfortunately it's the sort of movie that looks a lot better than it plays.<br /><br />Director Stephen Gaghan who wrote the script for Traffic (2000), a drug war thriller in which several story lines are meshed, uses a similar technique here with the unifying factor being oil instead of street drugs.  Despite an engaging performance from George Clooney and fine support, especially in the smaller roles (e.g., William Hurt, Christopher Plummer), the formula doesn't work as well mainly because the story goes nowhere.  Plotless movies tend to bore the audience since there is no rising action leading to a climax and resolution.  Although people die and fortunes wax and wane, the linear story fails to engage our sympathies.  I think this might have worked had the focus been on Clooney's character and his struggle to warn the US of the danger of terrorism from the Middle East, a danger that we didn't fully awaken to until 9/11.<br /><br />See this, if you must, for George Clooney who won a Supporting Oscar for his performance.his performance.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This review comes to you in the hope that it will find the place in your mind where rationality resides and where decency and sanity, coupled with a healthy sense of anger, will trigger appropriate action. For practical reasons, I have to confine my discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which I have something new to say. Forgive me if I ramble; I'm really upset, as I think you can tell. Believe you me, if you think about it you'll see that Al Gore's overbearing perceptions are merely a distraction. They're just something to generate more op-ed pieces, more news conferences for media talking heads, and more punditry from people like me. Meanwhile, Al's thralls are continuing their quiet work of advancing Al's real goal, which is to outrage the very sensibilities of those who value freedom and fairness.<br /><br />Did it ever occur to Al that maybe I am fed up to the back teeth with his hypersensitive asseverations? Dream on. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Of course, if Al had learned anything from history, he'd know that he has become so hate-filled, so moved beyond the realm of reason, that I feel compelled to address the continued social injustice shown by ornery, impetuous harijans. But let's not lose sight of the larger, more important issue here: his inaniloquent, stingy treatises. Having said that, let me add that it would not be out of character for him to impose a narrow theological agenda on secular society. I'll probably devote a separate letter to that topic alone, but for now, I'll simply summarize by stating that the best thing about Al is the way that he encourages us to discuss the programmatic foundations of his self-indulgent disquisitions in detail. No, wait; Al doesn't encourage that. On the contrary, he discourages us from admitting that all of the bad things that are currently going on are a symptom of his insipid, self-aggrandizing subliminal psywar campaigns. They are not a cause; they are an effect. Thus, in summing up, we can establish the following: 1) I find Al Gore's apologues rather minatory, and 2) conventional wisdom states that he is surely failing in his legal and moral responsibility not to offer hatred with a pseudo-intellectual gloss.cause; they are an effect.

B00003CX9W|5.0|Sorry Disney studios, but my heading was an actual promo quip for the FANTASIA theatrical release.<br /><br />I was first introduced to the awareness of the Fantasia movie while in elementary school viewing a \\"prehistoric animation clip\\" narrated as a seperate dinosaur documentary. Later I learned it was taken from Walt Disney FANTASIA feature. When I finally saw the movie as a whole in the theater, I was mesmerized. \\"The Dance Of The Hours\\" sequence was especially memorable, since no one in the audience could stop laughing at the animal ballet antics.<br /><br />Being a soundtrack collector, even as a young kid, I got the 3 vinyl album issue of Fantasia soundtrack on Buena Vista label, which included a program insert that was as wonderful as the movie. It even included a fold out long colorful poster which had been used to promote the re-release of Fantasia in the 70's.<br /><br />Therefore I totally agree with people's opinions that this animated feature is relevant to interests of all ages, young children and adults.<br /><br />I would listen to the classic movie soundtrack over and over, picturing the fantasies in my mind. This is a wonderful addition to any childs collection, whether soundtrack, movie, or both! Do not wait!
B00005B1W5|5.0|I went wild over 'Live at the Acropolis' (LATA) after the 1993 performance and again over 'Tribute' when the tour hit New York State in 1998. Yanni wrote the music for both, but I think his biggest contribution was the talent he assembled, headed by Karen Briggs and her violin in both concerts. The CDs with audio only were spectacular, but you have to see them! And you can!  <br />Then there was Vann Johnson. I'm not really into vocals, but to me, \\"Love is All\\" was the most powerful vocal performance since Frankie Laine's \\"Lucky Old Sun\\" circa 1950, which I'm old enough to remember. (Laine died recently at age 93.) The lyrics of \\"Love is All\\" were cryptic, but the delivery, which I witnessed live twice, was mesmerizing, another big time 'spectacular.' I will always love both performances and the thrill of seeing as well as hearing them, and both are easily 5 stars, but overall I give LATA a very slight technical edge.

1582701709|1.0|The review of The Secret CD in today's (3/15/07) USA Today (pg 5D) expresses my feeling about The Secret book, CD and DVD better than I can. Quote by Deirdre Donahue, USA TODAY, <br />\\"I'm not like most journalists. I don't like self-help. I adore it. I pride myself on my eager embrace of self-improvement regimens (remaining, alas, a never-ending project). And I admire a lot of self-help writers, considering them to be can-do descendants of Ben Franklin. So I was pumped to listen to The Secret on CD by Rhonda Byrne. After all, Oprah Winfrey featured the book on her show -- twice -- and it's No. 1 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list. Yet The Secret audio ranks as one of the silliest, most derivative bits of fluff ever pressed into plastic. Boiled down, it is a rehash of previously known New Age theories about attitude and attraction. Valuable self-help offers concrete guidance, a new theory or fresh insights. That's no secret.\\"  <br /> <br />

0743298020|3.0|Like \\"The Kite Runner\\", this book receives rave reviews.  I have read both books and think that they are entertaining but would stop short of calling them great literature.  Just like a lot of bestsellers these days, these two books follow a certain formulas/rules obviously taught at writing courses.  Incidentally, the author of this book used to teach a writing course, and the author of the \\"The Kite Runner\\" started writing after attending a writing course. <br /> <br />Add a little bit of suspense here.  Add a little bit of tear jerking sentiment there.  Throw in a bit of romance and a few lines of supposedly sadness or malancholy.  Voila!  You have a bestseller which is ready to be filmed.  There is even no need to hire a script writer.  I call these books written for movie and easy consumption of the readers and viewers. <br /> <br />This book is supposed to be about twiness and loss.  But the author fails to convey the depth of feelings supposedly felt by twins.  All we get is the heroine, Margaret, wondering around moaning about the loss of her twin, and how Adeline and Emeline went into shock when they were separated.  To me those are very shallow attempts at tackling the subject matter indeed.  Keep repeating the words \\"sad\\", \\"loss\\" just do not cut it.  A more skilled writer will be better at conveying these sentiments without even using these words. <br /> <br />Perhaps the fact that this book is well received says much about our MTV-fast food culture.  Readers expect the usual cliched but easily digestible suspense, violence, sex, dysfunctionality, romance, with a happy and definite ending.  Nothing too challenging for the brain.  Nothing too uncertain.  Nothing requiring reflection. <br /> <br />What happens to books which make one think and reflect, instead of books which spoonfeed their readers with ready made sentiments? <br /> <br />If you like a Gothic story, there are better ones out there like \\"Jonathan Strange and Dr Norrell\\". <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This album is great. My favorite Dream Theater to date and my favorite prog of all. After you buy this you should also buy the \\"Score\\" DVD. <br /> <br />You all know this album is great and so it's a bit redundant for me to bother with yet another fanboy review. All I can say is that I listen to at least one song from this album every single day since it first came out. Dollar-per-play it represents more value than most other albums I've ever bought. <br /> <br />But, the real motivation for writing this review is to simply correct the editor: <br /> <br />\\"Keyboardist Jordan Rudess lends subtle and deft touches throughout helping further solidify\\" --Jedd Beaudoin <br /> <br />What are you thinking, man?? Have you seen them in concert? Have you watched \\"Score\\"? Don't get me wrong, I'm a guitar guy and John Petrucci is a favorite. But, don't discount Jordan's contribution on this album, please! Many times throughout when you first think \\"this guitar work here is awesome\\", it turns out it's not John on the guitar at all, but Jordan on the keys. Specific example- the entire first 4 minutes of title track \\"Octavarium\\" is Jordan on a combination of keyboard and the Continuum Fingerboard (Haken Audio). I can see someone thinking it's guitar, but it's not. In fact, I'd argue that John's guitar contribution actually takes an unlikely backstage to Jordan's keyboard work in general on this album. Both are awesome, but I just wanted to stress that there is *nothing* \\"subtle\\" about Jordan's contribution here at all.
B000002UWE|5.0|This compilation is a wonderful introduction to Talk Talk. In fact, it's a wonderful compilation, period. It allows the listener to clearly feel the way in which the band evolved from purveyors of standard-issue synth-pop to more art-oriented musicians.  By not screwing up the chronology, the set has a wonderful sense of flow that makes the experience all the more wonderful. <br /> <br />And the music is great, too. The early material is poppy fare that's quite in tune with the times. \\"Today\\" and \\"Talk Talk\\" are sing-along ditties that anyone with a sense of fun can instantly appreciate. The next few tracks possess a slight moodiness that serve as a precursor for the ambient sensibilities that are to come. Then, we get the hit \\"It's My Life.\\" It's the apex of their pop sensibilities, as far as I'm concerned. You can't top that track. It's impossible.  <br /> <br />As such, the music changes direction following that song.  \\"Life's What You Make It,\\" despite its popularity, is still a bit of a plodder. \\"Happiness is Easy,\\" despite its kids chorus, is artier than most of the material that preceded it. And then things get even more abstract. \\"I Believe In You\\" is beautiful, as is \\"Desire.\\" However, these tracks inhabit a totally different plane than the first tracks on CD. These are mood pieces, intended to establish an atmosphere rather than make the day-glo kiddies dance. Hollis is still there to provide insight, but he's merely adding colours to a  picture as opposed to telling a story. <br /> <br />And then there are the two live tracks. That's the way to make a compilation: Chronologically-arranged studio tracks with some live stuff tacked at the end. I don't care for \\"Life's What You Make It,\\" so I could've done without it. But thankfully, the compilers decided to give us a miraculous version of \\"Tomorrow's Started.\\" That track can move my soul like no other. It's a highlight, and a great closer. <br /> <br />Overall, this collection will appeal to a wide audience. The new wave kids will like the early stuff. Pretentious arty kids will like the latter material. Your average Joe will probably enjoy the whole thing, although he might get a bit bored at the end. That's okay, though; this is a great primer that present a great band. Sure, there are a few less-than-perfect tracks scattered about, but in the end, this CD has mass appeal and is totally worth purchasing.

If you are even partially into punk (if there is such a thing), you need to own this.<br />A few words about the remaster. On a whim, I decided to upgrade to this. I don't have audiophile ears so I haven't noticed a significant change. We're not talking about the remaster of Raw Power here. The main differences really are the cover (blue instead of red), the CD color (gray instead of red), and the CD insert photo (a live shot from a gig). All the songs seem to have the same punch they had before. A cheaper alternative to buying here: this is out of print on Amazon, but is still available on the Dischord website.<br />So, if you're a die hard Minor Threat fan, go for it. But if you still have your old copy, an upgrade isn't really necessary.
078401213X|5.0|_Pi:  Faith in Chaos_ is a bizarre cult movie featuring a mathematician searching for meaning in the number pi and attempting to understand chaotic systems in nature that originally appeared in 1998.  The movie is entirely in black and white and attempts to portray an intense atmosphere of heady thought.  The central character Max Cohen is a mathematician obsessed with the quest for meaning in numbers.  He describes mathematics as the language of nature and notes the role of mathematics in explaining various natural phenomena.  In particular, he seems to be enamored of chaos theory (the idea that small changes in initial conditions may lead to large changes in outcome) and expresses the idea that the spiral is a universal form found in nature.  He lives alone in an apartment where he has set up a supercomputer (nicknamed \\"Euclid\\") that attempts to predict the stock market.  While obsessively working on these problems he encounters a Hassidic Jew who attempts to introduce him to the Kabbalah (a form of Jewish mysticism).  However, it is at this point that his mentor tells him that dabbling in such things amounts to numerology and that by leaving behind the trappings of scientific rigor he is moving into the realm of mysticism.  He is also followed by a group of people representing a large corporation who hope to use his discoveries to control the stock market.  It is while conducting his researches that he mysteriously finds a 216 digit number which may hold the key to the mysteries of the universe.  His mentor theorizes that his computer has attained consciousness and this number is highly important in that respect.  Followed by corporate Wall Street hopefuls and Jewish fanatics who hope to use this number believed to encode the name of God to bring the Messiah, and plagued by increasingly growing headaches, the mathematician faces an imminent crisis.  To see how this crisis is resolved (and ultimately unresolved) you must watch the movie.  Ultimately the movie asksus to question the very nature of reality and asks us why mathematics should pose such a profound tool in our understanding of that reality.  I recommend it as a strange, mind-expanding film that will shake one's assumptions and which shows the dangers inherent in all obsessions.
B0002X1JKU|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers that this book is an outstanding essay for those who want to learn how to select stocks for a value portfolio. Where we differ is that for the typical investor he does not have the resources to build a properly diversified portfolio- either financial or mental resources. Value stocks do provide returns in excess of broad market returns but in order to have adequate diversification you must assemble several hundred issues well beyond the resources of the average investor. Further one must have the time and skill to evaluate several thousand issues.<br /><br />Consider the following in light of current market competition to gain an advantage over ptofessional investors: Piscaqua  Research in a study covering the period 1987-96 found that only 10 out of 145 major pension funds, or just seven percent, out performed a portfolio consisting of a simple 60%/40% mix of the S&P 500 index and the Lehman Bond index respectively.<br /><br />Or is it logical I ask for you to believe that you can predict which actively managed funds will out perform, or are you overconfident of your skills? If you are trying to find the great fund managers who will out perform in the future ask yourself: what am I going to do differently in terms of identifying the future winning fund managers, than did the pension plans and their advisors? And if you are not going to something different what logic is there in playing a game at which others with superior resources have consistently failed?<br /><br />If you a really serious in finding an investment technique that will provide you with reasonable return with less risk I suggest the following little book.

The power of positive thinking!! That is it! They attribute successes to \\"fung shei\\" garbage like putting your couch in a spot for positive energy.  <br />This is a waste of time.

B000E1YVZU|2.0|Having heard great things about the Broadway musical but having never seen it, my wife and I decided to watch the movie.  Normally I like musicals, including Chicago, which again I saw as a movie instead of the Broadway musical.  Rent, however, was a disappointment. <br /> <br />It was very obvious that I was supposed to love the characters.  It was a complete mystery WHY I was supposed to love the characters.  Mark won't talk to his parents and, along with his roommate, lives in a HUGE studio apartment in NY that he hasn't paid rent on in a year(!).  He quits the one job he obtains because he has to work on \\"his\\" film.  After one year has elapsed, \\"his\\" film is a ~5 minute clip of his friends.  I could do that in two weeks while holding a full-time job.  Yet, he is one of the \\"good guys\\", whereas the friend who actually GOT a job and is trying to collect the rent (due for a year, remember) is evil.  Huh? <br /> <br />Most of the characters have something about them that could, under the right circumstances, elicit sympathy (AIDS, drug addictions, etc.).  However, the stories behind them are never told; futhermore, the charcters generally celebrate the very lifestyle choices that got them into the unfortunate circumstances, becoming EXTREMELY self-righteous and preachy in the process.  About halfway through the movie, I gave up on enjoying it, though I did continue watching.  I just never felt anything like I was supposed to feel.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This is the best calculator for financial users.  I am an accounting major and had originally bought a TI, but doing cash flows, etc. with it was so cumbersome.  Most of my friends had the 12C and liked it so I gave in and bought it.  I am impressed at the ease of use.  The Reverse Polish Notation takes a bit to get used to (you can turn it off), but once I figured that out it was a breeze to use. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend to any accounting or finance major.

B0002DB50E|4.0|\\"Videodrome\\" is 24 years old, but the points it makes are just as relevant as ever.  Max Renn (masterfully underplayed by a top-of-his-game James Woods) runs a television station that specializes in airing cutting-edge shows (most of which involve pornography and violence).  While pirating the airwaves for new, unharvested material, he stumbles across a previously unheard of viewing experience: Videodrome.  At first, the show seems like nothing more than a serialized snuff film, but Max soon learns there is more there than meets the eye.  Literally.<br /><br />Like most of Cronenberg's films, \\"Videodrome\\" is a viscerally dizzying experience, and one that is bound to leave you scratching your head.  For its time, the special effects are well done: televisions pulse like living blocks of veined flesh, guns graft themselves to hands with bone-wires, reality warps and bends until it is completely and utterly unrecognizable.  Cronenberg is famous for adopting a sort of gutteral, sinewy take on life, and most of his movies are social commentaries that wield their symbols like gore-covered swords.<br /><br />\\"Videodrome\\" is, most obviously, an unabashed critique of the culture of mass media (and, yes, the movie is aware of the hyper-irony of using a film to decry television).  In some ways, this is what makes the flick a wonderful thing to watch -- the underlying message itself isn't spelled out for the viewer.  Cronenberg takes pains to blend his motives within his films.<br /><br />However, the cues he gives the viewer -- the sickening viscera, the fever-dreamish worlds, the overtly metaphorical names (Max, Brian O'Blivion, Nicki Brand, Barry Convex, Moses and Raphael to name a few) -- can sometimes be rather heavy-handed.  Cronenberg might be playing around with the audience, but that's not all he's doing, and for viewers with less patience (for those who don't enjoy philosophical sucker-punches, that is) the film may prove more nauseating than entertaining, let alone something to spark thoughtful debate.<br /><br />Cronenberg snaps a lot of bones and rends a lot of skin in this film, telling the tale of a man trying to come to terms with the duplicity and manipulativeness of his own art (and I use the word \\"art\\" loosely).  Max once used the tool of television to mold societies, and now that tool has developed a life of its own, has turned on its maker, has become its own legitimacy.  Viewing life through the lens of the T.V. screen, \\"Videodrome\\" seems to say, means that it is ever harder to understand just what is real and what is not and whether there's a legitimate difference between the two.<br /><br />Like Max himself, the viewer is enticed further down the corridors of madness with the old-fashioned carrot-on-a-stick trick.  The carrot, in this case, is the promise of meaning and cognizance.  Although the movie offers some kind of release at the end, it's not necessarily filling.  It poses as many questions as answers.  But, again, that's Cronenberg for you.  For him, it is the ride that counts, the scenery that spins by on the way, and not the sputtering cough of the engine as it is shut off just before the credits roll.<br /><br />Didacticism, especially when it is dressed with this kind of throbbing, unsettling flesh, can be distasteful for some, and it goes without saying that, for most, Cronenberg is an acquired taste.  But beyond the validity of any point he is trying to make with \\"Videodrome,\\" it must be said that the way he makes that point is certainly compelling.  Films like this don't achieve cult status for nothing.  Some people may find \\"Videodrome\\" a repellent, disorienting experience.<br /><br />Others will very likely be sucked right in.alone something to spark thoughtful debate. <br /> <br />Cronenberg snaps a lot of bones and rends a lot of skin in this film, telling the tale of a man trying to come to terms with the duplicity and manipulativeness of his own art (and I use the word \\"art\\" loosely).

B000L212HC|5.0|The Prestige is an awe-inspiring film which allowed its two key antagonists (Hugh Hackman and Christian Bale) to put aside their comic book alter egos and endulge in a bit of turn of the century magical whimsey. <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed the twists and turns thoughout the course of the movie.  If you haven't seen it before, you have to be sure to pay attention from the very beginning.  The movie truly takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  You are not quite sure which of the magicians you root for, but you are constantly filled with anticipation to see how the deception, misdirection and folly is played out. <br /> <br />MUST SEE movie of 2006.
B000J103PC|5.0|I watched this movie so much on ppv I broke down and bought the thing.  Meryl Streep is delightfully nasty and makes an excellent foil for Anne Hathaway's character.

0393035158|3.0|Although Harris is no doubt primarily concerned with criticizing religiosity per se, his book on \\"Faith and Terrorism\\" clothes that criticism with a supposed concern for prosecuting the \\"war on terrorism.\\"  Harris says that Islam's doctrines are the main basis of terrorism, making it necessary to criticize Islam, which is impossible if respect for religiosity in general puts criticism of any particular religion like Islam out-of-bounds.  (Harris also feels that the abuses of the war on drugs and the war on human sexuality should be combated by delegitimizing religiosity.)<br /><br />Harris's particular argument about terrorism depends on defining religiosity is an essentially intellectual phenomenon.  He argues this underlying point explicitly, saying that people are organized on the basis of religious doctrine rather than on \\"any other criterion of tribalism\\" (see page 13 in the chapter on \\"Reason in Exile\\").  On page 137 in the section on \\"The Danger of Wishful Thinking,\\" he rejects the idea that religious doctrine stems from any secular interest.<br /><br />This underlying assumption is arguable.  Harris doesn't confront the fact that the vast majority of people inherit religion from their parents and their parents' social circle.  For example, the fact that a person like the man who was running for the Senate in Virginia could be considered technically Jewish based on having Jewish ancestors indicates how society identifies religion with a person's birth.  And, as Harris himself points out, an individual technically can only exit Middle Eastern religions in the same way one exits society in general: by dying -- since leaving any of these religions is a crime of apostasy for which the punishment is death.<br /><br />Clearly, religion is more than just doctrine.  Among religion's aspects in addition to ethnicity (the society one is born into) and doctrine, there is also the political aspect.  Religion has been an organizational pillar of many states and especially, as is relevant for Harris's argument about terrorism, a concept around which states have mobilized populations for war.  Even in this respect, however, religion is fuel for waging the conflict, not conflict's source.  Harris cites many warlike religious texts, but without noting that they were written by or for warlords and political entrepreneurs who were also religious leaders.<br /><br />In sum, Harris is engaged in a larger argument that religious doctrine is aggressive and makes no sense.  However he may fare in that argument, his particular tack of arguing that Middle Eastern terrorism arises from a doctrinal dispute is not convincing.  There is too much evidence that this terrorism is a metastasis of what is basically a national-political conflict.ris's argument about terrorism, a concept around which states have mobilized populations for war.

B000002GZ1|5.0|I got the digital remaster from the UK along with East-West, and I have no regrets. The sound is far superior, and the price was actually less than if you bought both albums separately. For any big blues fans, these albums are as essential as Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, Mayall's A Hard Road with Peter Green, Allman Brothers Filmore East, or Bloomfield / Kooper / Stills Super Sessions. For Blues sessions, this is one of the cream of the crop ones, and definately a must have. Just be sure to get the UK remastered ones. (I have no idea why the US hasn't done it yet, but I do know that the blues is really a big deal in the UK).
0743298020|5.0|I find myself seraching for an excuse, any excuse, to leave reality for a while and enter this novel. The story is as captivating as anything I've recently read. I do not usually read ghost stories, but I am glad I made an exception for this novel. The characters and setting seem so real becuase the author uses the most unusual, creative descriptions to lure you into their lives. It is not a difficult read; set aside 2 days for this book and you will be glad of it.

0201485672|5.0|Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code is one of those amazing books that every professional developer should have on their book shelf. The bulk of this book is a catalog of refactorings, but there is more to it as I will explain below. <br /> <br />In case you aren't aware of what refactoring is, I'll give you Fowlers definition.  <br /> <br />\\"Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.\\" For the most part this means cleaning up your existing - yet working - code. It involves anything from renaming a method to be more concise with the purpose of that method, to breaking up switch statements into a polymorphic structure. There are many different techniques used to refactor your code, which is what you learn in this book. <br /> <br />Right off the bat Fowler throws you into a small sample application that is poorly designed. He then takes you through a few different refactoring techniques that improve the design of this simple application. Right from the start you see how effective refactoring can be. From there he goes into topics such as how to detect \\"bad smells\\" in code. This chapter is particularly informative and entertaining. You also learn a little bit about testing. After the introductory chapters you begin to dig into a deep catalog of refactorings. Each one is named. Like design patterns - naming the refactoring and building a vocabulary really helps in communicating thoughts and ideas. <br /> <br />The catalog of refactorings is extremely useful. They are structured so that each refactoring has a name, a motivation, the mechanics and a simple example. This is very effective. As I said earlier, the name is useful because it helps build your programming vocabulary and it helps in communicating thoughts and ideas. The motivation explains why the refactoring should be done and when it should/shouldn't be used. The mechanics provide a step-by-step description of how to carry out the refactoring and the example shows a small example of the refactoring in use. All examples are written in Java 1.1. <br /> <br />Although the examples are written in Java the book is still very good for any developer. Developers that have never written a line of code in Java, C++, C#, or anything similar may have a little bit of a tougher time working through this book. Luckily most examples are very small and simple so even if you fall into this category you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve. Some of the code is a bit outdated and can be done a bit better now-a-days but what do you expect? This book was written 8+ years ago! Times have changed. The ideas are still very relevant though, which is what makes this book so timeless. <br /> <br />Martin Fowler books are always a joy to read. His writing style is humorous, yet often very blunt and to the point. Just like UML Distilled, he is able to communicate a lot of ideas into a very short amount of space - the book is a bit dense in other words, which is very good in my opinion. Martin Fowler does not beat around the bush and he has very strong opinions on certain topics. Unlike a lot of books you read, he actually writes with personality. I have a hard time putting his books down. Here is an example of the type of verbiage he uses... <br /> <br />On how comments can be a \\"bad smell\\": <br />\\"Don't worry; we aren't saying that people shouldn't write comments. In our olfactory analogy, comments aren't a bad smell; indeed they are a sweet smell. The reason we mention comments here is that comments often are used as a deodorant.\\" - Martin Fowler. Here he is talking about how people use comments to hide bad code, or \\"bad smells\\". <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. If you are a professional developer or plan on becoming one then click the \\"Buy Now\\" button without second thought. This is one of those rare books worth its weight in gold - I would spend$100.00 on a book like this if I had to. <br />

Long after their debut, Iron Maiden remains relevant and has a progressive air about them.<br /><br />Seriously, if you like metal (or want to get into it, or value rock in general) PICK THIS UP! This is one of those rare albums that can be listened to all the way through without skipping a single song...everything just flows perfectly and despite having songs that would usually be considered too long, you HAVE to finish them.<br /><br />Oh yeah, might I add that that is some pretty sweet cover art?

B0001AVZA8|2.0|This is a pretty lame comedy, not much more than formula junk, though there is some good writing and the actors are truly fine.  Alas, nothing  new emerges, and the thought that the Nicolson character cd learn and grow - not only at his age but given his character - is ridiculous and ultimately ruins the impact of the film.  It is too bad, because Keaton and Nicolson are such graet actors that they cd have done something original, even pathbreaking.  Instead, it is just less rather than more.
0440238609|5.0|I loved, loved, LOVED these books. WOW! I had no idea they existed until I saw a list of the favorite books of the British - and this was in the top 3. Certainly, the British can't be wrong - they produced J.K. Rowling! I am a diehard fan of the Harry Potter series, and after reading other reviews mentioning their \\"similarities\\" I decided to purchase this set. While I agree that this series is fantasy, as is the Harry Potter series, the similarities are overstated. These are different writers with different strengths. Philip Pullman is adept at creating mood, of sucking the reader in, of involving the reader in the story, of creating a real, palpable world of ghasts, daemons, alternate worlds, and so on. I was totally riveted. I recommend this series to anyone who can engage in the imaginary, who can totally let go of their current reality. You will certainly not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />*NOTE* - These books are listed as appropriate for children or young adults, but they are dark and scary and, in some instances, gory. They are darker and scarier than the Harry Potter series. BEWARE! <br /> <br />Also, give the books a chance. When I started the first book, I didn't like it until I was in about 60 pages - I had a hard time figuring out what was real and what was a product of Philip Pullman's imagination, which was frustrating. Let go of your sense of reality, go with the flow, give the first book a bit of time to capture you and you'll not be sorry!!! <br />
0156421178|5.0|As with most everything Orwell, this book will not have you leafing ahead impatiently to find out if and when things get good. If there is one book you read on the Spanish Civil War (and I bet it will be only one), this should be it.
0199267170|2.0|I have the earlier edition and unless they have greatly improved the printing and binding, I cannot recommend the second edition.<br /><br />In the first edition, the text is tiny.  My guess would be that it's 7 or 8 pt type and my weak, middle-aged eyes have a hard time reading it.  Also, many times the printing is not complete and some of the words are impossible to read.  The text is formatted in two columns and they push it so close to the gutter between pages that you have to grip the book tightly and pull it apart to see the text closest to the gutter.  It can be quite tiring.<br /><br />The book is also just too darn thick to read comfortably.<br /><br />So far I've read only the three parts of Henry VI, which I enjoyed.  I think I'll not read any more from this book.  I've decided to buy each play individually instead.
B000006YYW|3.0|Although I consider myself a 'Gees fan, I have to admit that Robin is my least favourite vocalist of the group. That said, after liking a couple of the singles I decided to give the album a go.<br /><br />On the plus side, the songs are as strongly melodic as ever. At least half the tracks here would have made good singles back in the day. The production is a typically early '80's 'synthy' drone that does tend to detract from the songs 24 years on. Gibb's vocals, however, are an utter nightmare! I don't know if the original LP had a lyric sheet, but, boy, you certainly need one as RG's unearthly shrieks render most of the songs unintelligable. It's too much of a -not necessarily-good thing as Robin is given full reign to wreck almost every song with a grotesquely OTT display of appalling singing.<br /><br />Finally, I should also add that this CD really needs remastering as it's very 'soft' sounding with precious little bass and far too much treble.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I would have to argue he is the best bond since Connery. His manerisms and his acting are exactly what the Dr.No ordered.

Excellent.
B00005JNX0|4.0|Pixar always gets the lion share (forgive the pun) of excellent reviews.  But I found Madagascar to be every bit the equal of Pixar's best stuff.  The key test, that this DVD passes, is the repeated viewing test.  I've seen it probably 20 times now, since my three year old loves it, and I haven't yet tired of it.  The performances are excellent with Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) stealing the show away from Chris Rock and Ben Stiller.  David Schwimmer is funnier here than he's ever been on Friends.  It has a great ensemble feel, which seems almost impossible for an animated film.  And it has, ya know, a great message and all that.  But mostly, I enjoyed it simply because it was well crafted, and consistently funny.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|The Confessions Tour is by far Madonna's greatest live work. The reason I say this is because every show up to now has kept building on her former experiences live.

This tour is the culmination of all the things she has tried thusfar, wrapped up in one package, then thrown into the blender and presented here as a firece, energetic, flawless show. I saw this show 6 times in different cities and all from different vantage points. One of the things that is great about this DVD is the variation of shots, so you get the idea of what it was like to be anywhere in the arena! Unfortunately the editing of this DVD is a little to quick for my taste, I am a fanatic so I really want to SEE Madonna performing, while there is plenty of it available on this DVD I I feel it switches shots so fast in several parts, particularly in the beginning segment. The setlist is amazing, personally Confessions On A Dancefloor is the exact type of album I have been waiting for from M for several years, so since the setlist includes virtually every song from that album, I might be a little biased. However the production of the show is really what takes the cake, the programming, thed dancing, the visuals, the costumes, and the setlist all come together to throw a major dance party in the arena. The only other thing I noticed however is that they REALLY mastered Madonna's voice so it is nearly album-like even though it is live, but this may make it MUCH more enjoyable for the casual fan who might be expecting to hear somewhat flawless representation of album tracks. <br /> <br /> <br />BEST OF ALL?  YOU GET A BONUS CD!!!  <br />This is so worth having since it has the new version of Like A Virgin and Music, and also has the previously unreleased song Erotica/You Thrill me which is where the song Erotica as we know it today came from. <br /> <br />My Personal Highlights: <br />Future Lovers <br />ComeTogether <br />Like A Virgin <br />Live To Tell <br />Music <br />Like It Or Not <br />Music <br />Erotica <br />Hung Up <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 5 Stars <br />Setlist: 5 Stars <br />Sound Quality: 4 Stars <br />Editing: 4 Stars <br />Extras: 3 Stars, not very much extra, the segments are short. Even the photo slide show is short. not too impressive
B0001GL3K4|1.0|Contrary to the stars and acclaim I've read, my opinion is that this is one of the worst movies I have recently seen. It was recommended to me by a family member (ugh!) and I will warn those with a more \\"sensitive\\" palate in movies to avoid this one. There are several instances of graphic nudity and sexual simulation as a couple making a \\"porno\\" fall in love....how nice. Other issues include: affair contemplation, anti-American sentiment, every American portrayed is an orgy-throwing single-minded individual, coaching a pre-pubescent into the arts of sex with abandon to ANY morality, and actually little \\"love\\" other than the anticipation of bedding someone. I had much higher hopes based on other movies these actors/actresses had previously been in.<br /><br />One sub-plot that had some blossoming of love was the Colin Firth romance that came about, but that a man's maid is going to strip to her undies to retrieve some papers out of a pond is a bit far-fetched.<br /><br />Another romance is between Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister and his caterer. However, her personality waffles between meek and shy and a cursing flirt making the romance beyond physical attraction difficult to follow, to say the least.<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson has a decent part and probably the only comic relief was during the elaborate wrapping of a necklace, but that humor is dampened by knowing it is for the girl Alan Rickman is contemplating an affair with while his wife buys Christmas presents.<br /><br />All in all, I consider this very poor British soft-porn with very little \\"love\\"... actually.
0380789035|3.0|My friends had been hounding me to read this book for more than a year and finally I found the time. However, because of the hype it got I ended up feeling very disappointed.<br /><br />Gaiman has an incredible talent for storytelling. He weaves his characters quite intricately and they seem to work seamlessly with the setting. However, there is a problem with throwing so many characters into the proverbial melting pot of this book- you not only go back and forth between familiar names, but over several cultures and different aspects of..well.. gods.<br /><br />I, too, felt the that book had an ambitious beginning and that the plot kept trying to steer my off the course of 'figuring out' just what would happen in this story. Unfortunately my mind wouldn't allow me to go with the flow of the book and figure it out later-- it was a bit pretentious and predictable, which is unfortunate. If you know anything about Mythology you'll be getting the suspicious tickle in the back of your mind right from the very beginning about what is going on.<br /><br />His setting was romantic- traveling America from small do-gooder towns to state prisons, empty vacant lots of reservations, the author really did his homework with the setting. It was believable, but the characters and premise of the book was not believable enough to pull me in and make me feel emotionally attached to them.<br /><br />The biggest let down of this book was the ending. I felt Gaiman had done some foreshadowing that he never followed up on and that a lot was left unsaid. Perhaps the intention of the author? Perhaps not. Regardless it left a bad taste in my mouth that left me less than impressed with the story at large. I would have liked this story to end with something more significant, something more telling of the incredible journey we follow the main character, Shadow, through. It did, indeed, leave something to be desired.<br /><br />I had heard this was Gaiman at his finest. Unfortunately I don't know if that is good enough for me to follow along in his other installments. 3 Stars for excellent story-weaving, but a not so fantastic conclusion.on't know if that is good enough for me to follow along in his other installments. 3 Stars for excellent story-weaving, but a not so fantastic conclusion.

B000KQGP2G|2.0|Com' on guys! You're so excited about the fact that new PoS album arrived that your reviews are not objective. <br />For those who hasn't purchased this album, think twice. <br />It's not similar to Be, it's more similar to prog-metal than to \\"nobody knows what is it\\" Be.  <br />However, if you expect that this is Perfect Element part II, you will be disappointed. The Perfect Element I, one of the best prog-metal albums ever, is light years from that. <br />I listened this album six or seven time already, and I really wanted to like it. But it didn't really click on me so far. <br />There is no song on the album that comes even close to Used, Ashes, Ending Theme or Undertow. <br />Ok, let's get down to the subject. <br />First of all, the artwork is just terrible. Hey, guys, how much did you pay the \\"designer\\" for the artwork? ;) Can I be your designer next time? <br />The first (title) track is pretty good: well-played PoS prog metal.  <br />The second track is pure rap in the best gansta-rap traditions, dumb and boring. I belive this is the only thing in America Mr. Gindeglow loves now! ;) <br />The third track is ok, but nothing special. Daniel demonstrates he learned to say the word \\"f*ck\\" :) <br />The next is America. The song sucks. There is no melody in this song, arrangement is terrible, and \\"lyrics\\" is so primitive that could be written by anybody.  <br />If you want to criticize something, Daniel, at least do that good, like say Lennon or Dylan did!  <br />The next one is Disco Queen. This track sucks also, musically and lyrically. I still try to figure out why did they put it on the album. <br />The rest of the tracks are from pretty good to not bad, but nothing spacial. It is obvious that PoS is drifting towards being an ordinary mainstream rock band, good but not distinctive. Most of those songs could be composed and performed by any good rock band. <br />To summarize my impression, I must say it is sad to see PoS is getting down. Perfect Element Part Iwas their peak, and Remedy Lane was close to it. <br />After that Mr. Gindeglow started taking care more about politics than music, and Be and Scarstick clearly show that.  <br />If you are a fan of PoS, you probably will want to buy it. But don't buy it new: it doesn't worth it. <br />If you are not PoS fan, take The Perfect Element Part I or Remedy Lane instead: they are great! DO NOT start with this \\"masterpiece\\"!  <br /> <br />P.S. As one reviewer said PoS are not against American people, but against American Goverment. <br />Oh, really? PoS rejected touring US because they are agains Iraq war. <br />Fine, but who started Iraq war? PoS fans in America, so PoS don't want to play before them? Or the Goverment that doesn't care at all whether PoS likes it or not. Sorry, but Mr. Gindeglow disappointed me.  <br /> <br />

B000AWYOGE|2.0|This movie had great potential.  All it turned out to be was sort of long and boring at time.  Here's the problem, without spoiling the movie.  The pace of the movie didn't move up at all.  Instead it crawled at a very linear angle and just didn't seem to rise to a climax that was satisfying.  Jennifer Connelly is a gorgeous actress and an extremely convincing one at that.  But, her talents were waisted in this very surreal movie.  I like the claustrophobic atmosphere the movie conveys, but, I never felt that the character was really in any danger or in a really terrifying situation.  Like I said, it had potential, but really didn't take you to where it should have.  The ending was great and unexpected, but, as a whole, the movie was way too drawn out.<br /><br />See it for yourself and see what you think.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Yes, I know this album was created by George Martin and his son for a Las Vegas show - but I listened to this album on it's own merits.   = = = = This is the Beatles Concert That Never Was. = = = =   This is what the Beatles could have sounded like,   IF......   If they had all lived until today AND if they had continued to use all the new technology to develop their music into a fantastic concert production AND if ego and girl friends had not torn them apart.   This album shows what an incredible concert tour that might have been.  There are solos by each of the Beatles. There are complex, interlaced songs which create a whole new sound, and there are hints and snips of tunes which they would have used to bridge to another great hit.   The \\"concert\\" ends with \\"a Day in the Life\\" and as the final thrum fades away, you know that the audience is going wild.   And then, as the Beatles come back and do their encore with Hey Jude, Sgt. Pepper, and Love Is All You Need, you can feel the excitement, as the entire audience is on their feet, cheering the world's greatest rock band and hoping that the night will never end.   Whew!   And that's what I thought of this outstanding Album.
B0000549B0|5.0|Harvey is one of my favorite black and white classic movies.<br />Jimmy Stewart is Elwood P. Dowd, an ever so tipsy gentleman, that introduces his friend, Harvey, to almost everyone he meets.<br />Harvey happens to be a six foot invisible rabbit, a pooka! A pooka, according to Irish folklore, is a mischievous spirit, especially one that takes on the form of an animal. In this instance the pooka is a rabbit, one that only Elwood P. Dowd can see. A pooka can enter through locked doors and windows and is said to be here and there, there and here, everywhere and anywhere.<br /><br />Elwood P. lives with his easily flustered sister, Veta Louise, superbly played by Josphine Hull, and her daughter, Myrtle Mae (Victoria Horne). Myrtle Mae desperately wants to get married and, Uncle Elwood, because of Harvey, stands in the way. Elwood will do anything to keep Veta Louise happy even if it means being sent to a sanitarium. This is where everything literally goes crazy!<br /><br />Poor Veta Louise is mistaken as the one being commited! Enter in the man of Myrtle Mae's dreams in the form of Wilson, a male nurse played by Jesse White, the first Maytag repairman. Myrtle Mae's romance with Wilson gets off to a rocky start when he is the one who must forcefully keep Veta Louise locked in the sanitarium. Every time she sees him she screams and says, \\"Stay away from that man, Myrtle Mae, and keep him away from me\\"!<br /><br />Complicating matters further at the sanitarium, is the relationship, or lack of one, between Dr. Sanderson, (Charles Drake) and Nurse Kelly, (Peggy Dow). They are in charge when the mixup happens and find themselves having to find Elwood P. and bring him back.<br /><br />Dr. Chumley, played by the talented Cecil Kellaway, is the head of the sanitarium. He encounters Elwood P. Dowd and Harvey and soon develops a bond with Harvey. Dr. Chumley wants Harvey to stay with him and Elwood, who wants what's best for Harvey, reluctantly leaves without his best friend.<br /><br />The bewildered, impatient taxi driver, played by talented Wallace Ford, (I know you will recognize him) drives the family back and forth to the sanitarium. He and Veta Louise's friend and, not so secret admirer, Judge Gaffney, played by the scraggly voiced William Lynn, add wonderful color to the story. If you have never seen this movie, now in DVD, you will be in for a treat! ~ Mrs. B.r, played by talented Wallace Ford, (I know you will recognize him) drives the family back and forth to the sanitarium. He and Veta Louise's friend and, not so secret admirer, Judge Gaffney, played by the scraggly voiced William Lynn, add wonderful color to the story. If you have never seen this movie, now in DVD, you will be in for a treat! ~ Mrs. B.
B000J103X4|5.0|that the only problems anyone has with this album is that he mentions dr. dre in almost every song. <br /> <br />the music is straight up good. if you listen to it so much that you have to obsess over the littlest things to find problems with it you know it's a straight classic. <br /> <br />my favorite song is 'bang!' with kurupt and daz. kurupt is straight vicious on that song and rocks it hard. if only dpg's album last year sounded so good. other favorites include 'wouldnt get far' (k west beat and verse), 'remedy' (just blaze beat), and 'compton' (will.i.am beat, which is surprisingly hot). <br /> <br />best album of the year. yes, he beat nas, jay-z, eminem and birdman & lil wayne with just his second album. and I can only see him getting better.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|All right, first things first... why 5 stars as opposed to the rest of the reviewers who've got it pegged as a 4-star affair?<br /><br />Because they're comparing \\"The Departed\\" to previous Scorcese efforts, and because they feel it doesn't match up to \\"Taxi Driver\\" or \\"Goodfellas\\", they're demoting it.  Hogwash.<br /><br />If there's any justice in this world, Scorcese will win best picture at the Oscars.  There isn't a false note played by the entire orchestra, and praise in particular should be singled out to Leonardo DiCaprio, who (as an actor I haven't cared for in the past) finally rose up and claimed one of his films as his own.  Over the past few years, the boyish good-looks have given way slightly to a more jaded, more polished actor, and he just might be Johnny Depp's rightful heir.<br /><br />Beyond that, however, the rest of the cast is flawless--kudos to the casting director--Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin (never funnier), Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone... this film doesn't simply re-create \\"Infernal Affairs\\", it actually improves on the source material.<br /><br />When Roy Buchanan's \\"Sweet Dreams\\" fades you out to the credits, you'll feel a sense of euphoria, that you haven't felt in a long time.  That this may be a master director's last shot at the golden prize, but even if it fails, you know in your heart that the film didn't fail one bit.  All the way down to the soundtrack, \\"The Departed\\" is an absolute must-see.<br /><br />The Best film of 2006, hands down.  I haven't gushed like this about a film in quite a long time.
B00005JJX8|4.0|I've been watching Hitchcock's films in chronological order, and had just seen the wonderfully and carefully restored Rear Window from the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection. As they showed the difference between what they started with and the final product, it was truly significant.  <br />This version of To Catch a Thief is similar to the unrestored version of Rear Window, and this film with so many stunning on-location views and vistas of the Riviera and its elegant hotels and chateaus -- which contributed to its color staff winning an Oscar -- deserves the full restoration treatment.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Yeah, someone leaked it. Sorry. I've already pored over this thing a dozen times. First impression was that it was good. Now I'm in awe. What they did before with Rebellion and Laika and Vampire Forest Fire has been surpassed. Completely. <br /> <br />The album is subtly political, with lyrics that can be internalized, but which are wrought with criticism of consumerism, religious hypocracy, apathy and war. <br /> <br />The first track, \\"Black Mirror\\" feels like a redux of Echo and the Bunnyman's 80s pop-wave and throws in Win and Regine's vocalizations right off the bat. Setting expectations for more of the play between male and female vocals that made Funeral so eerily gorgeous.  <br /> <br />Personally I think the middle of the album is amazing. From \\"Black Waves\\" through \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\" it rolls through your head with the kind of pungent melodic brain melting ambrosia that made you feel at home with all of the neighborhoods. <br /> <br />This album is brilliant, if you didn't catch that yet. <br /> <br />I wrote another paragraph on each song but realized what a long, useless review that would be. Each song carries itself. There is enough diversity to keep you interested, but it's not so terribly different from their previous work. It definitely feels and sounds like the AF you've come to know and love. <br /> <br />I want to own this record. I can think of a dozen people I want to give this to. It doesn't matter that I have all the songs already. It carries the AF authority that us kids just seem to know and crave. If you're as excited as I was about hearing this album, you won't be disappointed. Get it, put it on repeat for a couple of days, then set your alarm to wake you up to it. You'll realize you've known these songs already from inside your soul.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I've purchased a number of: headphones, behind-the-neck headphones, and earbuds. The earbuds become painful after a short period of wearing them, some of them fall out easily. Many of the headphones feel like vises. Other behind-the-neck headphones move around too much or become dislodged from my ears when I move my head.<br /><br />These headphones are so lightweight they are barely noticeable. They stay on my head. The left ear piece does, however, become dislodged enough that I must reposition it. One thing I did not care much for was the fact that I had to turn the volume up quite a bit over other types of headphones.<br /><br />So, when the ear pieces stay lodged in the ear canal -- and -- with the volume turned up, these are very comfortable and enjoyable.
B000002LND|5.0|Sensational cd. <br />The only down side is that several of her hits are missing, including 2 of my favorites, True Blue and Who's that girl. <br />A great trip back in time, and really well done. <br />A fantastic buy for anyone. <br />
1596912367|3.0|I HAD to read it. It is William Boyd, after all, one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Many years ago, a friend told me I HAD to read News Confessions. And I did it : I took me away. Loved it. And advised other people to read it.<br /><br />Since then, I am still looking for the next Boyd masterpiece. The Nat Tate story was brilliant. Some others were sustaining. Is Confessions his masterpiece? Yes. What is Restless? A far cry from Confessions... It made me wait for those Boyd comments & twists. Interesting, enjoyable, but really not the best Boyd ever. There is no real punch in this one, just interest in going on to find out more about the Eva character.<br /><br />I'll stop here, Mr Boyd. I will still read you and wait for a new strong book like you are capable of.
B000002P5R|5.0|Back in the 70's I wore out my vinyl copy of Hendrix's Cry Of Love Album. Songs like, Drifting and My Friend have been floating around in my head for all these years and I had tried to find a copy of CRY Of Love on cd several times with no luck. Well, here it is under a different name and with some additional songs ! These are some of the best cuts Jimi Hendrix ever recorded and the music sounds as good today as it did when I was a kid. Absolutely great stuff.
0060566108|4.0|Built to Last explains the differences between the great and the REALLY GREAT companies. The book asks the question why settle for being great when you can be monumentally stupendous? It is an impecably researched book (the appendix in the back of this book is excellent) that breaks many of the stereotypical beliefs of success experienced by large corporations.  <br /> <br />We can learn new things and new ways of looking into things. Also we can discover why visionary companies stay forever. Money seems to be everything in our lives and it is the reason for these companies' existence. However, it is not what drives these visionary companies.  <br /> <br />The characteristics defined to select the most successful companies are excellent measures of quantity and quality. The key idea, that success does not depend on having an early vision and charismatic leaders but on identity, culture and commitment to the company steer us into different paths for future success.  <br /> <br />The focus is not only on the executive team to set the tone, but also on the hiring process and the freedom people are given to create. It will give you new insights and most importantly ways to implement <br /> <br />And by the way, nice guys (and nice corporations) DO finish first.
B00005Q66T|4.0|This cd is really very good. <br />The only down sides are that some of her songs from this period are missing, some edited, and no new songs were added. <br />Otherwise, it is fantastic,a great buy, and a must have for any Madonna fan. <br /> <br />Impressive.
B0001MDQ6W|5.0|This is a great lesson in how one generation sees another. Bob on Mtv is one more proof that he wasn't just a voice of us Baby Boomers, see how easily The Times They Are A'Changin fits NOW. Dig the way new phrasing of old material just plain rocks, like Desolation Row. Timelessness and the power of the music smacks you upside the head even when you're looking for it.
0307276902|5.0|It makes/made NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER to me that parts of Frey's story were exaggerated, made up, whatever.  I read this as a story, and what a powerful story it was!  I read lots and lots of books and was completely blown away by Pieces.  It was like a punch in the gut.  I loved his writing style, his determination, grit, and his ability to conquer his demons by sheer force of will.  If only, like Frey, more people would quit blaming others and figure out how to be the person they want to be, and, as Nike says \\"Just Do It!\\" Completely inspiring and spectacular book for me.  I can't imagine people getting wrapped around the axel about the Oprah thing so much. Sheesh!  Just give it a rest. Isn't supporting each other (especially people trying to inspire others with their story of how they broke out of a cycle of addiction) a better option than ripping each other to shreds?  Get over yourselves, please!
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins analyzes several companies that have gone from being mediocre to excellent. He finds that they have been able to create a set of characteristics, including the following, which enabled them to go from good to great.  <br /> <br />Level 5 Leadership - Level 5 Leaders are driven, humble, modest and more concerned about the prosperity of the company than their individual success. They resolve to do whatever it takes to make the company great, no matter how hard the decisions are.  <br /> <br />First Who ANd Then What - Using a bus analogy, Collins claims that great companies first get great people on the bus, then decide where to drive it. According to Collins, the right people are your most important asset.  <br /> <br />The Hedgehog Concept - Good-to-Great companies do what they can do best (not what they want to do best), what they are deeply passionate about, and they focus on what drives their economic engine.  <br /> <br />A Culture of Discipline - Discipline means that there is little or no need for hierarchy, bureaucracy, or excessive control.  <br /> <br />Confront the Brutal Facts - These companies believe that they will prevail in the end, but also have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of their current situation.  <br /> <br />Good Technology - Technology can help accelerate moving from good to great but is not the cause of it.  <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent book that helps you see what you are doing right or wrong in your organization.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|The 1st time I ever saw Madonna LIVE on tour was on her \\"Re-Invention Tour 2004\\", and now my 2nd time seeing her was on her \\"Confessions Tour\\". This has got to be her best tour ever! Just my opinion! I just love her as an artist and a performer. This lady can put on a show!!! I just love it and I can't wait to see what Madonna has in store for us next. We know she's now working on a new album, hopefully another tour would follow. I LOVE YOU MADONNA!!!
B00008977N|4.0|I saw it in Netfilx rotation and came here and bought it. Consistent, entertaining and I found myself humming the tunes the next day.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|This is exactly what you probably think it is--George Martin and son messing around with classics. George Martin has always been highly respectful of the Beatles and of course had a huge part in their success so it's his right (I guess) to mess about with these sacred songs. As for listening to it--well it's fun, sort of. I just can't imagine anyone ever opting for anything here rather than the originals. Probably a great souvenir if you seen the show in Vegas.  <br /> <br />Overall I would say if you've heard the entire beatles cataloge a gazllion times (like I have) you will enjoy this 7 or 8 times before it goes into the collection to collec dust. Somthing fun to throw in every two years or so......

B000M06K5C|4.0|How can you be a big fan of Bloc Party if you think \\"A Weekend In The City\\" isn't good? It's not great, but neither was their debut. Both albums show promise, and U2 didn't hit their stride in their first two albums. \\"A Weekend In The City\\" isn't radically different as some reviewers are touting. It's a natural progression, but it's very much Bloc Party. There might be less staccato drumming than on their first album, and there also might be more actual singing here than on their first, but overall it's still recognizably Bloc Party.<br /><br />What prevents \\"A Weekend In The City\\" from being truly great is some songs do not enhance one's listening experience. For example, I felt that tracks like \\"Where Is Home?\\", \\"Kreuzberg\\", and \\"SRXT\\" were just okay. I got my copy at Target, so there were two bonus tracks, \\"The Once And Future King\\" and \\"Secrets\\" that were excellent, and should have been put on the album proper rather than left as bonuses. I think \\"The Prayer\\" was a good choice for first single, and I think \\"On\\", \\"I Still Remember\\" and \\"Song For Clay\\" could all be follow up singles. \\"Hunting For Witches\\", \\"Waiting For The 7.18\\", \\"Uniform\\", \\"Sunday\\"--they all compliment the best tracks, making \\"Weekend In The City\\" one of the best new albums of 2007. This band shows great promise in a similar vein to the classic Rush. Bloc Party seem to be blazing a trail of progressive alternative punk/rock music, and the appear to have no peers at this time.
B000KZ3BWE|1.0|Al Gore and his politically correct film An Inconvenient Truth is full of hot air and Scare Science~!  This film is full of one-sided \\"scientific\\" facts about global warming that are simply meant to be used as a political tool to bankrupt large, prosperous countries like the USA.  REAL science has not proven global warming is caused by humans----what it does prove is that climate change in itself is a normal process and is dependant on the sun and the normal cycles of sunspots that occur on it.  Al Gore is such a huge, hot-air-filled windbag and incredibly egotistical to assume that human activity is to blame for GLOBAL climate change---and even to assume that humans have ANY effect on weather!  Think about it----have we EVER been able to stop a hurricane---stop winter---stop any natural weather phenomenon???  Ask yourself how Leif Ericksson navigated the Northwest passage, landed on a green Greenland and even grew grapes there???  How did ancient Britain grow wine grapes on their island????  I believe it was WARMER----as in global warming that was warmer than our hottest summers now!  They didn't even have cars or factories----so I guess according to Al Gore and his Greenie cohorts---it must have been farting cows.....................Knowing history and both sides of the story is the only way to avoid being swayed by propaganda---which is all An Inconvenient Truth is.........
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|There isn't much to add to what the other posters have said about this truly historic DVD remastering, but allow me a few comments.  This is it, the granddaddy of Met telecasts on PBS, the first in the long-running, but recently sadly dormant, \\"Live from the Met\\" series.  (Apparently Peter Gelb's commitment to live movie-theatre telecasts from the Met will help get the PBS series back on the rails--we've already had the English-language \\"Magic Flute\\" on broadcast TV this season, with \\"I Puritani\\" coming soon.) Scotto and Pavarotti make a nearly unbeatable team in this score; both have Puccini's music coursing through their veins.  Scotto was in her \\"plump\\" period here (seeing a video playback supposedly prompted her weight loss!), but she's plump in a cute way.  As always, dramatically she goes straight to the heart of the role of Mimi, and vocally is in near-prime condition.  As someone else commented, it's such a pity her definitive Butterfly, well-documented on studio (audio-only) recordings, was never videotaped for TV.  Pavarotti does nearly lose the high C in \\"Che gelida manina\\"--but give him proper credit for not transposing the aria down a half-step as Domingo always had to, and as Carreras does on the 1982 \\"Boheme\\" telecast!  At this early-mid stage of his career, he is definitely a LOT more mobile than he later became, and that's all to the good.  But the revelation is in the light and shade of his facial expressions.  His ability to act for the cameras--when he was of a mind to--always surprised (and pleased) me.  The rest of the cast is an eminently likeable bunch.  Wixell was never exactly an Italianate baritone with his grainy, wide-open timbre, but he was a consummate musician and sings magnificently here.  Paul Plishka never seems to get his due from critics--count me as a longtime fan of his rich, sonorous voice and bluff, hearty acting.  Similarly Allan Monk, the Schaunard, always seemed much underrated and underprized, at least to me.  Gorgeous, rich, lyric-baritone sound and fine characterization--was the voice perhaps undersized in the house? (I never heard him live.) Marilyn Niska's Musetta never struck me as being quite on this level, but she contributes an enjoyable, lively performance.  Levine was at his very best in this score, and the Met Orchestra and chorus responded with crispness and precision.  <br /> <br />I must dissent from some of the positive comments about the production itself, borrowed by the Met from Chicago Lyric Opera.  On the original March 1977 PBS live telecast it looked dark, dank and dreary, even the Cafe Momus act. It still does... DG's remastering can't do much about that, but the clarity they achieved is still pretty remarkable.  The sound is cleaner and richer than I remembered too, though PBS still had a lot to learn about miking the Metropolitan Opera House effectively. The later Zeffirelli production with Stratas and Carreras is thrilling in an eye-candy sort of way, and nearly as well sung as this one.  But this is my sentimental favorite.  <br /> <br />As with the Met \\"Rigoletto\\" and \\"Luisa Miller,\\" DG has seen fit to remove all of announcer Peter Allen's commentary during the curtain calls, but owing to the historical nature of being the first PBS Met telecast, they do include NBC newscaster Garrick Utley's introductory remarks.  I remember being rather annoyed and/or impatient with the live backstage interviews--\\"for God's sake, let these people go to their dressing rooms and REST until the next act, will ya?!\\"  But actually I'm glad to be able to see them again.  (But note that for the second PBS telecast, \\"Rigoletto\\" in November of '77, the interviews were PRE-taped.)  Many thanks to the Met and DG for bringing this classic performance back in such a fine remastering!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Having seen all the Bond films I have to say Casino Royale is quite possibly the best Bond movie to date.  I'd have to watch it a few more times to really decide where it falls but it is undoubtedly in the top 3. <br /> <br />Also, Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is quite possibly better than Connery's.  Craig's Bond is certainly 2nd best if not the best.  I'll hold on decision until Bond 22 comes out November 7th, 2008 (hopefully).

B000GFLE86|5.0|This is a terrific set. Peyroux's style combines the best of Billie Holiday with just a touch of Norah Jones (too much of Norah can be way too much for me), and the result is a wonderful listen.
B000B8TOH6|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is a re-release of the original \\"Crossroads\\" compilation.  Disc #1 is the same, with 2 favorite added tracks: \\"In these arms\\" & \\"Never Say Goodbye\\". Disc #2 has bonus tracks, some tracks from the Box set & various other hits from Slippery When Wet & These Days.  My favorite on disc #2 is \\"Blood on Blood\\" LIVE (from the New Jersey record). <br />The DVD is part of the Live from London concert already released earlier. <br />Its part of my collection, I've been a fan for over 20 years.

The variation of songs on the Black Parade are something that isn't found much these days.  You have the teenage angst song appropriately named \\"Teenagers\\", the anthem songs \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" and \\"Famous Last Words\\", more morose songs \\"Cancer\\" and \\"Terrors\\", and the rest are all good too.   <br /> <br />My favorite song is Famous Last Words and the radio played Welcome to the Black Parade to death.  This CD will definitely be one that I keep coming back to.  Great job, MCR.

B000001G7O|5.0|This CD comes from a live concert on Assumption Day, 1988, a special date every year at the Salzburg Festival. Karajan was quite aged by then, and he had broken off relations with his Berlin Phil., exclusively recording with the Vienna Phil. at the end. He made some autumnal Tchaikovsky recordings that I find very moving, and this version of the Violin concerto is one. Tempos tend to be measured, phrasing is tender, rhythms often rounded out. If that appeals to you, then you'll know what to expect.<br /><br />As for Mutter, a violinist I rarely listen to, she plays glamorously but without vulgarity. Her luscious, full tone is ravishing(even though the miking makes the G string sound too scratchy), her phrasing full of musicality. She was then, and remained for years, the most glamorous of violinists. Critics of her playing will find things to complain about in a reading where the spotlight is constantly on her, but this isn't the B-minor Mass.<br /><br />In the end the combination of Karajan and his most successful protegee sweeps aside all objections (including those related to the CD's very stingy timing--the concert ended with a Schumann Fourth Sym. that DG could have included).

B000001GXE|4.0|I've put the key words in the headline: this is tough-guy Schubert played relentlessly. The great Carlos Kleiber apes Toscanini here, giving us a reading of undeniable quality while making the journey so rough that it's hard to say whether it was enjoyable. Certain movements, like the seond in Sym. #3, are rushed to the point of eccentricity, yet the playing from the Vienna Phil. is never less than perfect. As with Toscanini, a listener may be won over by the performance's intensity while knowing that this isn't how Schubert should go. It's fashionable to view this most lovable of composers as moody, dark, and death-haunted, so Kleiber may be trying to make that point here. The same relentless quality applies to the \\"Unfinished\\" as well; the brass outbursts in the first movement are especially brutal.<br /><br />Normally I would give this CD 3 stars for being so hard to listen to, but Kleiber always deserves respect, even when he's wrong-headed.

B000NGTJTY|4.0|This film is so good I saw it several times. Marty Scorsese directed, and it is supreme..thecfactvthstvthis film takes place in Boston is a real plus. This is a soft take off of 'Whitey' the head gangster in Bston's Southie for long. He had the FBI in his pocket, and, he in turn, had lots of surprises.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, a boy grown to man from South Boston recruited by mob boss Frank Costello. Frank is played by Jack Nicholson, the Whiteyish, character. Colin enlists in the state police as Costello decides. Someone to spy for him.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a police cadet, sent undercover by Capt. Queenan, played by Martin Sheen, to infiltrate Costello's gang. Both men succeed to the top of their game. Now, we don't know who is real and who is playing the game.<br /><br />This is a violent game with lots of blood and gore.  Women come and ho, and one psychiatrist in particular is known to both men.mFrank Costello s not a nice man, and as we see he thinks he can outwit anyone. Maybe he can. Captain Queenan is a force if his own, after Costello for a long time, and he wants him tied up in bows and delivered.<br /><br />The performances by all are spectacular, the soundtrack is superb. This is one of those films you will not soon forget.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 10-25-14

B000IFQLSW|5.0|I've always had a problem with Kenny Wayne.  He was a talented, good looking young guitar player helped along by his manager/promoter Dad and he doesn't sing.  The myth is true, \\"you have to pay your dues to play the blues\\".  That's why the older guys are the best.  They've lived through a lot of [...] in their lives.  Now I don't mean technically proficient as much as that certian phrasing, tone and vibrato.  It seems Kenny Wayne is trying to capture some of that magic for himself with this production.  I'm glad he did because this is a very well done package.  The Gatemouth segment alone is worth the price.  The sound is very good considering the various environments.  My utmost respect for Kenny Wayne Sheperd for taking a risk in doing this.  I would buy a follow up, so I hope he does one.  It'll take something really special to beat this out of a grammy award.

B000001ESN|5.0|1980 Not my favorite but it has it's moments.  Terry Brown is back giving the album a great sound but not the best production of RUSH's 80s catalogue.  There's more acoustic guitar in this one (compared to other RUSH albums)& lifeson is using a lot of distortion on his electric solos.  Peart is still using ludwig drums (he goes to TAMA on moving pictures onward) & they sound great with alot of fullness & power.  Geddy Lee's vocal range is only continuing to evolve here but his bassing is muted & much less complex & his keyboarding is fairly simple or absent.  Lifeson was never a huge fan of heavy keyboards & it showed on this album as geddy's pattern's were simple & short.  There is alot more space in this album as the guys are not as busy in their instrumentation (especially geddy). Overall, fewer tempo changes, less extra percussion, fewer complex bass parts, & fewer dominating keyboard patterns.  This album is heavily dominated by lifeson's guitar playing. One notable moment is in the song different strings where geddy lee is playing a rhythm piano which is very rare in a RUSH album & the only time that I can think of (to hear piano in a RUSH album).  notable songs are spirit of the radio (of course), jacob's ladder, & natural science. Don't get me wrong...  I love this album but I think that lifeson had a heavy hand at the arranging end of this one.  It's still an epic & has endured to become a classic album.
032147404X|4.0|If you're looking for a book that will teach you every last detail about theory, mode, and practice for digital photography, don't get this book.  The book serves much more as a quick reference guide for beginning to intermediate photographers, on issues ranging from focusing to equipment, and from composition to the digital printing process.   <br /> <br />As a many other people have noticed, Scott's 'humor' is a bit much at times and probably distracts away more from the book than he may have thought when he wrote the book - but it can be ignored enough that you can still enjoy the material and learn from it.   <br /> <br />Although the real focus of the book is digital photography, there are also a lot of helpful tips on shooting situations (flowers, landscapes, weddings, portraits, etc) that will apply to any kind of camera: from digital point-and-shoots to large format film photography.   <br /> <br />Overall, the book is a helpful guide to those wishing to make their photography more refined and professional by making simple changes to what they already do.
B000002I8D|3.0|1981 - Where do you start?  I massively respect Collins as a drummer, producer, soloist, arranger, etc...  When he released this album in '81 many thought genesis was through.  In fact shortly after it's release genesis was in the studio working on abacab.  So that issue was put to rest in a hurry.  Collins brought alot of experience to the studio with him including phoenix horns (EWF), eric clapton, shankar, jon martyn, john giblin, daryl stuermer (genesis), & others.  Hugh Pagham engineered the album with collins.  Hugh Pagham continued to work with collins, genesis, & the police in the 80s.  By this time Collins had established himself as a musician who wanted to create & expand & had earned the respect of his peers.  The main reason he made this album is because he finally realized (around DUKE 1979-80) that he could write & arrange songs alongside banks & rutherford.  Up until then he didn't write much. Around DUKE he brought misunderstanding, in the air tonight, please don't ask, I missed again, & if leaving me is easy to banks/rutherford & they chose misunderstanding & please don't ask for DUKE.  They didn't hear a hit in in the air tonight.  After the DUKE tour collins used the remiaining tunes for his own album & of course, in the air tonight was huge & still is.  The others made it on the album as well.  The album as a whole is largely uneven & it encompasses alot of R&B & jazzy sounds which collins enjoyed.  Although good, some of the songs sound as if they should be on different albums.  The album is largely organic & simplistic.  Apart from in the air tonight & hand in hand there is little drum machine. The rest of the album is acoustic drums & persussion.  Don't get me wrong, the musicianship is good, just a little inconsistant. There are some good jazzy moments showing Phil's vocal range, solo drumming style, & love for horns (which are awesome) including I missed again, thunder & lightning, & tomorrow never knows (beatles tune).  Daryl's guitar workis good but limited & less complex.  The roof is leaking is a good acoustic piano tune showing phil's ability to play piano which obviously develops in the 80s (You can hear a Tony Bank's pattern here).  In tomorrow never knows there are tracks of hand in hand being played backwards.  All in all a classic album showing phil's well-rounded chops & his love for R&B music.  It is also a departure from the genesis sound.  Many say that when abacab (genesis album following face value) was recorded in late 1981 they could hear a heavier hand of phil collins in the arranging.  This is probably true as collins gained alot of confidence in writing & singing.  the drumming was obviously not a problem.  I think too that genesis lasted longer because they had solo projects.  They worked with others & came back with unfinished bits & put them together to make an album.  Collins has said it made the group stronger...
B00006NSGX|5.0|I am not an Eric Clapton fan. In fact I find him boring; but this is different. A friend of mine had this thing - and I asked who the hell it was. Eric Clapton - What, I said. This has got to be one of the hottest albums of recent times. Brings together old-style rock 'n' roll and the refinement of TV appearances with those super-polished studio drummers and bassists.<br /><br />A burst of energy!<br /><br />The video's exceptional too. Some versions have the 2 CDs and the DVD. Not this one, tho.
0072373350|5.0|5 Stars. <br /> <br />Fundamentals of Aerodynamics, by John D. Anderson, provides an excellent foundation in aerodynamics for engineers.  Presented at the graduate or senior undergraduate level, this book covers all of the fundamentals in a student-friendly manner that also works well as a professional reference. <br /> <br />Dr. Anderson has quite a gift for placing information in appropriate contexts - both technically and historically.  The book is well organized and promotes learning by laying a solid foundation and then building on that foundation.  The sample problems presented through the chapters are clear and effective at illustrating important points. <br /> <br />Major topics include: Incompressible non-viscous flow, Compressible flow, and Viscous flow (including an introduction to boundary layers).  Significant time is spent on potential flow theory and it's application to the prediction of lift and induced drag. <br /> <br />Also recommended for students of aeronautics are Dr. Anderson's other titles, including: <br /> <br /> - Introduction to Flight <br /> <br /> - Modern Compressible Flow with a Historical Perspective <br /> <br /> - Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics
0446678430|3.0|This is Rich Dad Poor Dad reprinted with a few additions. The message of the book is correct: create assets that create passive income, avoid debt, get out of the rat race, don't count on job security etc.  <br /> <br />One element is missing, though. The risk of building a business is also high, as well as failure rate. Kyosaki is a very successful businesman, but like many other successful people he fails to mention the role of chance in building a successful business. Yes, if you persevere, you may build a good business and become financially independent. But you also have a chance of being broke, bancrupt and have a heart attack. Dentists on the average financially do better than college dropouts, even though some of the dropouts may become very rich, like Bill Gates. <br /> <br />By all means, read this book and follow its principles. But read also Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\", a sobering balancer.

It claims that you attract the bad things that happen to you. I say this is cruelty, especially to ill people who believe with all their hearts that they'll get better, but when they get worse, this video says it's their fault. Why can't we believe that brilliant people like Cicero, Einstein, Mozart, and others were brilliant because they were brilliant, not because they were trying to hid the Secret from us?  <br /> <br />You can get all the worth from the film in this word: try.

0142004413|5.0|Gerald Durrell's comic account of living on Corfu with his family as a child is as much fun as you will ever read.  At 10 (and 60, if you read his other books) Durrell had a mind for little but the animals in the environment around him.  In one episode he relates how his tutor was only able to get him interested in history by adding in \\"anecdotes\\" such as Nelson's collection of birds, including detailed lists of what species and who got the birds after Trafalgar.   <br />If you have a 10 year old who is only interested in collecting snakes and butterflies, this will be immensely enjoyed (the story of the geckos living in his room alone will surely be worth hours of wide-eyed fun)...but you may not want to encourage full Durrell emulation (such as when he saved a bunch of baby scorpians in the house, until discovered by his long-suffering brother Larry).
B0009P42S2|4.0|As his follow-up to \\"Akira,\\" Katsuhiro Ôtomo spent a staggering eight years producing \\"Steamboy,\\" a stellar example of anime steampunk. It's full of detailed animation, solid direction and some really inspired action scenes, although the final fourth is extremely bloated. Dark, detailed, gritty and full of smoke, steam and grime.<br /><br />In the mid 1800s, Dr. Lloyd Steam (Patrick Stewart) and his son Eddie Steam (Alfred Molina) are involved in top secret experimentation for the O'Hara Corporation. There's a disaster which leaves only one machine intact -- the Steam Ball.<br /><br />Then Eddie's son Ray (Anna Paquin), a budding inventer, gets the Steam Ball in the mail -- and some thuggish Foundation men destroying the house to get the valuable machine. Ray escapes with the Ball, barely eluding the men, and ends up captured by a rogue zeppelin that tears a train apart. Great scene.<br /><br />But the man in charge of this is none other than Ray's father Eddie, who was terribly burned and is now part machin. Eddie, who is still working for the Foundation, is in charge of the powerful Steam Tower and all the war inventions inside. Now Ray's loyalties are divided, as his father and grandfather battle in a war that has no clear \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" -- but which may wreck London, then the world.<br /><br />If you're going to spend almost a decade working on a movie, then people expect a masterpiece. And while \\"Steamboy\\" won't change anime the way \\"Akira\\" did, it's still a prime example of the steampunk genre -- Victorian English surroundings, but with steam-powered tanks, subs and other technology.<br /><br />The main plot is basically about a family's conflict over different ideas about how technology should be used. But Katsuhiro Ôtomo includes a deeper meaning to the conflict -- there's no clear-cut villain and hero here, since both Eddie and Lloyd have good intentions, though one believes in peace through power, and the other knows that power corrupts.<br /><br />And the animation is amazingly detailed, so you can see every puff of steam and smear of grease. No big watery eyes here. It makes the action scenes -- including a zeppelin and train almost smashing into Victoria Station -- all the more compelling. In between, we have some solid character development, such as Ray getting to know the bratty O'Hara heiress, and experimenting with primitive subs and machinery.<br /><br />But every movie has a flaw, and \\"Steamboy's\\" is that the last fourth is bloated. It's a brilliant battle -- especially the flying soldiers -- and the end itself is satisfying. But it's too slow and meandering, and has too many lingering shots of the bulbous tower over London. Fortunately it regains its footing in the last few minutes, especially when Ray takes control of the plot.<br /><br />Ray himself is one of the most compelling child-heroes ever -- he's genuinely smart, resourceful and mature, but he's still young. He's only learning that not everything in life (even your family) is what it seems. And the supporting cast is also good, with a subdued Molina as Eddie and Stewart as the feisty Lloyd, who seems like an older version of Ray. And then there's Scarlett, a spoiled brat who is pretty annoying up until the final battle.<br /><br />\\"Steamboy\\" suffers from a rather slow finale, but the movie itself is a brilliantly-animated, solidly-plotted adventure. Definitely worth checking out.can see every puff of steam and smear of grease. No big watery eyes here.

B00008R9M0|3.0|Mr. Jones and Mr. Smith are back and, IMHO, and their chemistry is as good if not better than in the original (this time IMHO Jones deserved top billing).  Rip Torn is given some lines that I'm sure made him wonder if the $$$ he received from being in the second movie was worth the public embarrassment.  Tony Shalhoub, on the other hand, is hilarious during the deneuralizer scenes (even though the writers saddled him with stolen lines). <br /> <br />On the other hand, with the exception of Johnny Knoxville as Scrad/Charlie, the villians are downright awful, and, as much as I like Patrick Warburton's other work, his short appearance here was pretty bad. <br /> <br />The Superbit technology doesn't get as many opportunities to shine as in MIB, although it is quite noticeable during the first subway scene and at the end.  I'm still impressed enough with Superbit to choose it over other formats, even if I sacrifice the DVD \\"bonus features\\" to have it.
1582403589|5.0|Sick and Twisted. Two words to describe Robert Kirkman. Oh, did I mention genious as well? Well, he is. Kirkman's story telling is just awesome and he adds a lot of plot twists and turns, in the future books. The artwork is perfect, I don't read the TBB (I have the comics) , but I'm guessing the artwork still stands true. If you like this, check out Kirkman's other \\"beauty\\", \\"Battle Pope\\". It's about The Pope, but not the one you're thinking of. He's a cigar smoking and Satan bashing, type of Pope. Goo quality reads, both of them.
B00008R9LZ|5.0|Mr. Jones' and Mr. Smith's chemistry in this movie is remarkable (and Rip Torn and Tony Shalhoub are great, too).  I normally avoid buying DVDs of comedies because for me even the best don't always hold up well after repeated viewings (they get stale).  This one definitely maintains its freshness.    I was skeptical about the \\"Superbit\\" version, given the over-hype of most video and sound technologies, but, since I was able to get it \\"pre-owned\\" at a good price, I figured \\"Why not?\\".  Visually, it's stunning, and the audio is awesome.  In the future, if there's a Superbit version of a movie I want to buy, that's the one I'll get.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I have all of Norah Jones CDs and I love them all.  Some people say that all of her songs sound the same.  I agree that they are similar, she did too in a recent interview, but I just love the soothing sound of her voice.  I like to paint as a hobby and her music is wonderful for that.  It's also good to do yoga to.  On this new CD, Not Too Late, I think she did extend herself and try some new sounds.  There is one song that really reminds me of a New Orleans sound.  The only thing I wasn't quite happy with was that I bought the CD from Amazon by an advanced purchase, before the CD came out.  I thought I would save money that way, but I saw the same price in the stores and I got my CD a week after it had been out in stores.  I don't know why it took so long to be delivered.  I probably won't do any advance purchases in the future.  Even so, I am very happy with this CD, I highly recommend it, and I also feel that Amazon is still a good place to buy from.
0312965788|5.0|Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying \\"Truth is stranger than fiction\\" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments.
044022425X|4.0|I first read Outlander 5 or 6 years ago and loving it, dove head-first into Voyager.  I tried to do the same with Drums of Autumn, but for reasons I couldn't remember until I re-read those books recently, I never finished Drums of Autumn.  Of course, Claire and Jamie are wonderful, multi-dimensional characters that I care about.  That's the task of an author, I think...to get the reader to care what happens to his or her characters.  Claire's struggles and mishaps in adapting to 18th century life are charming and funny, but Brianna's just make her seem silly and do not endear her to the reader, not this reader anyway.   <br /> <br />As far as the progression of the book goes, it's somewhat halting and discontinuous.  The author takes time to develop a couple of interesting story lines and then drops them entirely with no more than a bit of commentary well beyond the undefined turning point.  More than once, I found myself lost enough that I flipped back through the pages assuming that I'd glossed over some important chapter that would tie together loose ends.   <br /> <br />I stopped reading Drums of Autumn the first time because the new characters weren't especially lovable and there were times when I had no idea what was happening.  I gave up.   <br /> <br />Having said all of that, I really did like the book.  Gabaldon's way with words is really special and even if I'm not clear on what is going on, I like reading about it.  Claire is as funny as ever (though I could do without the bit where the Indians see her almost as some kind of deity...she doesn't need to be supernaturally amazing in EVERY way) and Jamie is drawn perfectly.  If I weren't so interested in Claire and Jamie though, I might have quit reading a second time.  But I guess that that is one of Gabaldon's successes.  She did such a brilliant job with Outlander that I'll gladly buy any story with Jamie and Claire and forgive her entirely if there are certain aspects that work less well than others.  Upon finishing Drums of Autumn, I immediately went out and bought the next two books of the series.

B000J103PC|3.0|Despite massive hype and great word-of-mouth reviews of \\"Devil Wears Prada,\\" I was somewhat disappointed in the overall quality of this movie. The parts are all there, but I found the substance pretty shallow. I did think Anne Hathaway was perfectly cast and her naivete and gradual education about the NYC Fashion World were sweetly portrayed and quite interesting. As good as she is, Stanley Tucci is even better: his Nigel rises above the stereotypical \\"Fashion Queen\\" and he gives a sensitive, perceptive portrayal of a man who has sacrificed love and even his identity to advance in this world. As for Meryl Streep, I hate to say it but I just was'nt impressed with her. Most of the critical Hosannas  are due, in my opinion, to the fact that she is a successful woman over 50 in a meaty role. But she plays Miranda Priestly in such a one-dimensional way that you feel nothing for her character. Her ridiculous behavior (tossing a fur onto a computer, demanding a steak in 10 minutes) is unbelievable - especially today. When she finally shows a human side, it is so forced and manipulating that it borders on offensive. Emily Blunt, Miranda's Assistant, fares only slightly better. I did'nt hate this movie - it does have its moments - mainly thanks to Mr. Tucci - but I don't see what all the fuss was about.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A certainty this will not be the last fine series to be poorly handled and sabotaged from the onset by network executives better suited for more modest endeavors. Rare is the program with a chemistry near perfection. A cast of quality and depth, we looked forward to learning a little more about them with each episode. I tip my hat to Joss, for his far vision and obvious dedication. <br /> <br />This old combat sergeant says \\"Buy the Firefly Series or your next sentry duty will be coyote post.\\" Seriously, my fondness for Firefly will probably remain until I get the dirtnap.

1582701709|5.0|If you've seen The Secret DVD this book holds few surprises. It's mostly the text version of the movie.  <br /> <br />However, its strength lies in the fact that The Secret is such a powerful message. For those of you who haven't seen it this book has a life transforming potential. Even if you have seen the DVD the book's small size is perfect for carrying in a purse or jacket pocket. It also contains some additional material from Byrne. <br /> <br />It's a \\"must-have\\" for anyone wanting to start creating the life they wish for or simply wanting to Feel Good. <br />
4789009637|4.0|I was studying JP diligently though //pell mell// for 2 months before this arrived. Took notes from &#34;Japanese Step By Step&#34; and &#34;Teach Yourself&#34; and learned 150 JLPT kanji on my own. So it's been somewhat weird for me to adjust to a textbook format and Im inclined to think that my previous way of learning Nihongo = more fruitful and fun.<br /><br />Ive looked through &#34;Japanese For Busy People&#34; at the library and prefer their feel though JFBP is awful for learning kanji. The Genki illustrations look rather &#34;cheap.&#34; That being said ... the vocabulary lists are helpful and grammar explanations are very clear. The good thing about Genki I is that it forces you to learn the kana and kanji. Romaji is used sparingly. I'll try to update this after I finish the whole book.<br /><br />UPDATE: We're using this in my JP 1A class and it's a much better experience than using it for self study. For self study I recommend Kodansha's &#34;Japanese Sentence Patterns For Effective Communication.&#34;
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Hilarious? YOU BET. Great acting? HECK YEAH. Phenomenal direction? YES SIR. Basically, Little Miss Sunshine is an adorable must-see that transcends every typical movie in mainstream theaters. One of the best movies of 2006, without a doubt. I completely recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor and  willing to be submersed in this wackily realistic adventure of the Hoover family.
B000002X0Z|5.0|Mobb Deep doesnt make albums like this any more. Havoc and Prodigy busting grimy raps over production that ranges from nightmarish(think Extortion), to suspensful(think More Trife Life and G.O.D. Part III) to laid back(think Animal Instinct and Hell On Earth). Many people talk about The Infamous like that was the only classic that Mobb Deep had. While The Infamous was a classic in its own right dont get it twisted. Prodigy and Havoc bust the most grittiest and most complex rhymes of their rap career on this album!  Standout Tracks: ANIMAL INSTINCT, DROP A GEM ON EM(best subliminal diss ever), BLOODSPORT, EXTORTION(classic collabo with M E T H O D Man), MAN DOWN, NIGHTTIME VULTURES, G.O.D. PART III, HELL ON EARTH(killer title track), GIVE IT UP FAST and STILL SHININ. Filler: None. Bottom Line: Hell On Earth is Mobb Deep's best album next to The Infamous. Amazing rhymeshemes, slammin production(by Havoc who perfected his craft with this album) and the guest appearances shine right along with Mobb Deep. Check it out if you want to see Mobb Deep at their best.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I  Love this movie.  I have watched it at least ten times.  I first read the book when I was thirteen, and although the movie with Greer Garson and Olivier was good, this one is superb.  The settings, the cast (love Kiera Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen), everything about it is perfect.  Best money I ever spent.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|This film was very cool. The plot was a little far fetched, but I really loved it. The acting wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. Tom Cruise wasn't as annoying as he can be and Jamie Fox was decent.  <br /> <br />As far as the filming of the moive. They choose to film the movie in HD rather then Film. A reasoning (rumor) was Mr. Mann thought that HD could pick up better images in the dark then film could. It's either the compression on the disc or it's the HD camera they used but I thought the film looked very grainy and dull. This might have also been a stylistic choice. <br /> <br />There were also many errors in the making of the film such as seeing the camera man in the reflections and stuff like that, but that doesn't really take away from the fact that it is a entertaining movie.  <br /> <br />Overall I enjoyed the plot and action,but I did not enjoy the look. It's fun and not to be taken very seriously.

B000056N8X|4.0|The Highlander movies were sort of strange, to say the least.  The first one was fantastic and very original to me - it had an interesting plot and a fantastic concept.  Then Christopher Lambert was the perfect character for Connor, and Sean Connery perfect as his mentor.  But then the second Highlander movie came out, and it was nothing short of deplorable.  In fact, I'm still wondering why Lambert and Connery even egreed to do it.  The studio pretty much wants to pretend that one didn't exist.  The third one was better than the second, but that's hardly saying much.  It at least had an interesting concept of possibilities with the 'realm of immortals', being frozen in ice over time.<br /><br />But this was a Highlander movie IMO well worthy of the franchise.  It utilizes Adrian Paul from the series and does a great job of passing the torch from Lambert to Paul.  The story's about another Highlander named Jacob Kell (anyone notice how seemingly all the worst of the bad character's first names start with K?  What's up with that?  Kell, Kurgan, Kronos, Kalas, Kane, etc.) who seeks revenge on Connor.  Moreover, Kell is an immortal that doesn't play by the 'rules', and has far more scalps than any other immortal.  After forcing Conner out of hiding, Conner and MacLeod are forced to try to stop Kell.<br /><br />I liked this one.  The choreography was sensational, just like the television series.  Adrian Paul really is a martial arts expert, so it's no surprise he and ins sensei had a heavy hand in the sword fights and action scenes.  The plot was solid - the love interest was a little dry, IMO.  But the theme of the movie more follows the way the story evolved through the television series.  Also, the soundtrack was great... although nothing will capture the series quite as well as Queen's \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" or \\"Prince's of the Universe\\".  But I also wondered... is there even a 'prize' anymore with 'new' immortals??? That's the one thing the sequels & series could never get over.  Meh... it's still entertaining and I recommend checking it out.  Rumor had it another movie was being made, but I last heard of that one 2 years ago.eries could never get over.

B000E5N684|4.0|This film keeps you on your tows from the start. It does start with an interesting, very explicit bedroom scene, with an unexpected twist at the end. What follows is one of the best detective stories in recent years, with a loot of humour and plenty of sex, for which the film is really famous for. Sharon Stone makes quite an appearance, dressed or undressed, but either she, or the director of the film, or both, seem to have a fixation on smoking to an irritating degree. Now as to the director's cut, I am not so sure that it adds much over the previous ten-year anniversary two disc edition. It is certainly worth watching and at its present price, a real bargain. If you are thinking of buying the sequel, don't bother. It does not even come close to the original.
015603008X|5.0|A very interesting novel, starting with the way it is written: it's the main character's \\"progress report\\" on the experiment he was living. From an innocent good-hearthed adult with a low IQ, he is to become a culture-rich self-centered genius - but the development of his emotional core doesn't match his intelligence ascending - wich is a problem, specially because he starts remembering how difficult his early life was. <br /> <br />Charlie also sees himslef going from one extremo to the other - from a retard to a genius, and still can't get what he wants: real friends. Tha drama he lives, the tensions he must handle, the dilemmas, all shown to us from his sincere reports, is thought-provoking. A valuable book for those who enjoy psychology.
B000K4WLXA|4.0|If you are a diehard FF7 fan such as myself, it's just too hard to say no.  The differences aren't very big, but the inclusions of Last Order and the \\"Novels\\" for Denzel and Tifa which up until now were released in Japanese only, plus an all-new novel based on Barrett just for North America are just too much for the FF fan to resist.
B00005JNEI|2.0|This \\"documentary\\" was so-so, and way too favorable toward the brutal, anti-Semitic, porn-obsessed Saddam Hussein. The movie portrays Iraq as this desert oasis that the United States destroyed--filmmaker and poseur Catholic Mickey Moore didn't bother to interview any of the women that Uday Hussein had raped, or relatives of people who were tortured to death in Saddam's meat shredders. This movie was more of a hatchet job than an objective presentation of facts, except this time, propagandist Moore isn't trying to befuddle a gracious Charles Heston (\\"Bowling for Columbine\\"), and then later re-editing his footage to make Heston appear in the worst possible light. He pulls the same trick on anybody outside the Democratic Party tent, who by the way, voted to invade Iraq, although they'll now tell you that President George W. Bush was so beguiling that he fooled everyone. If the Democrats were fooled by Bush, whom they ridiculed as a poor public speaker, they should not be governing. Hoewver, Moore doesn't care about facts, he cares about who's a Democrat or Republican. If you really want to see an expose of how Washington, D.C., is controlled by moneyed biotech interests, see \\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" with Denzel Washington. That film scared me with its telling revelations that not even Michael Moore was capable of digging up, and its important message for today's youth.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION. THE MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD WITH A SURPRISE ENDING
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sure, the comic book imagery is great, if you're into that kind of thing, with stark black and white colors occasionally splattered with vivid red blood during this movie's many violent fight scenes and shootings. Blood gushes everywhere as a sadistic murderer is hacked to death and violently dismembered. The screen is equally splattered as other characters take multiple bullet wounds without dying, in true comic book form. The nude scenes are not as graphic, but are cartoonish. Mickey Rourke offers his best performance since \\"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man,\\" while Bruce Willis shines in his best movie since \\"Hudson Hawk.\\" The plot, which consists of several interweaving stories, is outlandish, and ultimately the movie doesn't hang together so well. It's as if the director spent too much time filling the screen with gore, and not enough time developing an original plot and characters.

B000BBOUU4|1.0|What this movie has in computerized special effects, it loses in character development, wit, humor, musical performance, and joy. In other words, it is another Tim Burton remake of a 70s flick (\\"Planet of the Apes\\" should be considered a crime against humanity). Let's hope that in another 30 years, a better director comes along who is able to capture the frivolity of the original film, especially with its heavyhanded moralizing. Johnny Depp is forgettable in this movie as Willy Wonka, and all his lines fall flat. This movie has no laughs. Don't bother with it.

The American Film Institute has had a ceremony presenting it's lifetime achievement award every year since '73.The show used to be broadcast on the major networks,now it's on cable.The director John Ford was the first winner.James Cagney,Bette Davis,Orson Welles,Alfred Hitchcock,Steven Spielberg,Clint Eastwood,Jack Nicholson,Barbra Streisand,Tom Hanks,Morgan Freeman,Mel Brooks,Jane Fonda and Steve Martin have also been some the honorees.&#34;Bullitt&#34;,&#34;The French Connection&#34; and &#34;Dirty Harry&#34; were also picked by The Library of Congress and The National Film Registry to be preserved for the ages.There are only 678 films on the list.Quite an honor.<br /><br />  The extras,are the theater movie trailer and a 15 minute documentary about the making of the flick.The movie was released in the fall of 1968 at around the time The Motion Picture Association of America began the rating system.&#34;Bullitt&#34; received a &#34;M&#34; rating,for mature audiences, which was later changed to &#34;GP&#34; then to &#34;PG&#34;.&#34;Bullitt&#34; has the distinction of being the first flick to use the word &#34;bull****!&#34;.Bullitt used it near the climax of of the movie.The tagline for one of the movie posters read,&#34;There are bad cops,there are good cops,then there's 'Bullitt'.Steve McQueen reportedly said that &#34;Bullitt&#34; was his personal favorite film role.At the time,he was one of the top box-office draws in the world and one of highest paid actors.Mr.McQueen passed away of cancer in 1980 at the far too young age of 50.Along with &#34;The Magnificent Seven&#34;,&#34;Love With The Proper Stranger&#34; with Natalie Wood and &#34;The Great Escape&#34; with James Garner from 1963, &#34;The Sand Pebbles&#34; with Candice Bergen and &#34;Nevada Smith&#34; with Karl Malden from 1966 and &#34;The Thomas Crown Affair&#34; with Faye Dunaway from 1968 and &#34;The Rievers&#34; from 1969,&#34;On Any Sunday&#34; from 1971,&#34;Junior Bonner&#34; with Joe Don Baker,directed by Sam Peckinpaugh  from 1972,&#34;Papillon&#34; with Dustin Hoffman from 1973 and &#34;Tom Horn&#34; with Linda Evans from 1980.I believe these are the best from &#34;The King of Cool&#34; Steve McQueen.e movie posters read,&#34;There are bad cops,there are good cops,then there's 'Bullitt'.Steve McQueen reportedly said that &#34;Bullitt&#34; was his personal favorite film role.At the time,he was one of the top box-office draws in the world and one of highest paid actors.Mr.McQueen passed away of cancer in 1980 at the far too young age of 50.Along with &#34;The Magnificent Seven&#34;,&#34;Love With The Proper Stranger&#34; with Natalie Wood and &#34;The Great Escape&#34; with James Garner from 1963, &#34;The Sand Pebbles&#34; with Candice Bergen and &#34;Nevada Smith&#34; with Karl Malden from 1966 and &#34;The Thomas Crown Affair&#34; with Faye Dunaway from 1968 and &#34;The Rievers&#34; from 1969,&#34;On Any Sunday&#34; from 1971,&#34;Junior Bonner&#34; with Joe Don Baker,directed by Sam Peckinpaugh  from 1972,&#34;Papillon&#34; with Dustin Hoffman from 1973 and &#34;Tom Horn&#34; with Linda Evans from 1980.I believe these are the best from &#34;The King of Cool&#34; Steve McQueen.
B000085RTX|4.0|4.5 stars.  I would really like to point out that the songcraft here is excellent, but there are a couple of negatives that eventually downgrade the album.  The first and most noticeable flaw is the thin sounding production.  These guys go for the big moments time and again only to be let down by low-tech sound.  Compare this album to their other release \\"The Black Halo\\" for a great comparison and contrast, as \\"The Black Halo\\" has tremendous production value.  Another way to see what I mean is if you listen to the three songs from \\"Karma\\" that are played live on \\"One Cold Winter's Night\\" just to see how huge the sound could have been.  The only other complaint I have is for the song \\"Don't You Cry\\" which just doesn't work.  Most of the time I love Kamelot's ballads as it gives lead singer Khan yet another chance to show his vocal talents, but this particular track I simply skip anymore.  This release was also a bit harder for me to get into initially, but over the course of a few more spins I came to appreciate what is here:  Progressive Power Metal songwriting of the highest degree.  Recommended.
0743455967|5.0|I agree with so many other reviewers of this book -especially the reviewer who considered how much it would cost to have Stephen King offer this wisdom to any aspiring writer in a seminar or one on one training session. If you want to write fiction, you must add this book to your list of tools. I've read it two or three times and keep it by my desk. Sometimes I'll pick it up and open it to a random page in his  \\"Toolbox\\" to revisit his opinion about some aspect of writing that he developed during decades of writing best sellers. It helped me back off from my muse (we get along much better now) and rekindled my closed-door writing discipline. This is a great book with fantastic insight provided by a source that couldn't be more credible.
B000M341QE|3.0|This film has intelligence, good acting, a more than competent director (legendary, in fact)...so why the average rating?  Because...in essence this is just another cop drama that drags on for about thirty minutes too long and with far too many characters for me to care about any one in particular.  I remember leaving the theater thinking that it was all pulled together nicely but it was also nothing remarkable.  Martin Scorsese's best films remain \\"Raging Bull\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\", and \\"Goodfellas\\".  \\"The Departed\\" comes nowhere near the level of those three masterworks.  For that matter, as hit-and-miss as Scorsese's \\"Gangs of New York\\" was, it was ten times more ambitious than \\"The Departed.\\"  All in all, I sincerely don't care if I ever see this film again.
B00009ATIX|3.0|Ever sometimes watch a movie where afterwards you feel like you didn't regret but you're there confused as to what you just saw? I had always heard of Solaris but never even bothered to watch it since honestly, I always got the feeling there was something better in the video store. After realizing nothing caught my fancy, I decided to check it out. It's certainly a very stylized and at times striking movie, it's also a case of a movie that's not for everyone. I knew I wasn't expecting some sci-fi shooter like Alien but I didn't expect it to be so serious. <br /> <br />Chris Kelvin is a scientist who gets called to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Some of the members are dead and the 2 left seem very spaced out and weird. Haunted by the recent death of his wife, he's shocked to find his wife Rheya is up and about. Why is she here and more importantly: is Chris going to reject or embrace this strange re-apperance of his wife. <br /> <br />Solaris, the original, can be seen as a response to Stanley Kubrick's 2001. But whereas that film was more ambigious and has more sci-fi meanings, this is more of a character study than anything. For some, it's a great chance to see George Clooney pull out some acting chops while for others it's just a really slow movie with a whole lot of nothing happening. Some will definately hate it while others will find it underrated and misunderstood. For me, I have no clue what this one is. <br /> <br />It's a weird state of affairs when the commentary is even more enjoyable than the film itself. Done by director Steven Sodenbergh and fellow director James Cameron, the 2 discuss the film and how the film might've been different if Cameron did it. It's always a weird geek moment when 2 directors chat but you wish it was on a more better movie. And of course we get the ever standard EPK making-of stuff. Even if you rent the movie, at least watch the commentary too. <br /> <br />Is it a recommendable movie? I have no clue. Most critics use the love it-or-hate it thing to suggest that those who do take a chance will be surprised and treated to a good movie. I'm just going to leave it with a \\"rent at your own risk\\".
B000JLTRIG|4.0|After the stagnant and lackluster season 6 I was reluctant to pick up what I believed to be the final season.  As a result of season 6 many long-time fans jumped ship and really didn't care if the show floundered and sank.  This is really a shame as season 7 picks up a gust of magical wind and sails the show off into the sunset on a strong current of good shows.  The first half of the season deals with the Avatars and is basically a through story with many different character dimensions that were absent in season 6.  This slow burn lasts until the story is resolved.  After this the show seems a bit directionless, but with the help of a riotous Billy Zane for a few shows \\"Charmed\\" regains the humor of those hilarious early years.  There is even one great scene where he dances with Phoebe while dressed up as Gene Kelly from \\"Singin' in the Rain.\\"  Great stuff!  There is even a surprise cameo appearance by one of the former cast members during one episode (no, I won't spoil who re-appears) that had me smiling a bit.  The final episodes attempt to bring closure to the story while leaving a hopeful \\"out\\" for a possible future return of the Charmed Ones.  Recommended.  (Final Note: I heard a rumor that there is a season 8?  Season 7 wraps everything up into a tidy bundle, so it would be hard to imagine where the show could go from here, anyway.)

0800141660|4.0|In her commentary track, Emma Thompson accurately notes the difference in style between Jane Austen's early  novel Sense and Sensibility (two version A and B so it it is a bit hard to date) and later novels such as Emma. She calls the style of  Sense and Sensibility -- I think- \\"prolix\\" and in fact it is a much more difficult novel to read than Pride and Predjudice Emma or Persuasion (though not perhaps Mansfield Park). I would rather call the style \\"dense\\" that is it makes you work to discover its pleasures. I don't know that this density can be reproduced in a film--though it might have a chance in a well conceived mini series (Lonesome  Dove comes to mind). Sense and Sensibility is a disturbing novel--one that resists easy and perhaps any definitive interpretation. What causes its pleasurable vexations is the language (not its \\"message\\") and as  Thompson notes, only a few lines from the novel were used in the film. Consequently we are presented with a romance--beautifully conceived and superbly acted--a romance well directed and well written (hats off to Emma Thompson) but it is really not Jane Austen and doesn't give us a sense of what it is like to read  Sense and Sensibility. I think Emma Thompson might agree.  <br />I have dwelt on the movie's compromises--but given the  time limits of a theatrical release I think this is the best you can do. This is a lovely film with its own integrity.   While it does not prepare a viewer for the novel, it is a graceful achievement in its own right. It has its own intelligence and craft and is well worth seeing. Just keep in mind that the driving intelligences behind this film belong to Ang Lee and Emma Thompson (and the splendid cast) Jane Austen's vision (and I still don't know quite how to describe that after many readings) is only remotely present. This probably sounds like an indirect slap at the movie; it is not. This is a film to watch with care and delight.

B00005NTNM|5.0|The third picture featuring Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. Clint Eastwood resumes his role as Police Inspector Harry Callahan; Tyne Daly plays the role of Inspector Kate Moore and Harry Guadino as Lt Al Bressler. Harry gets into one of his usual predicaments when his is relegated to Personnel to help interview patrol officers on the list to make inspector. While filling his duties in personnel he learns that there are eight openings for inspector and three of those eight will be filled by woman. A group of people who call themselves the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), led by Bobby Maxwell, are making plans to go on a crime spree all over the city of San Francisco. When Dirty Harry's longtime partner is killed by the PRSF during a major weapons theft, Dirty Harry vows revenge and, surprisingly, is given some support by his superiors. Harry has one problem, he's given a new partner and it's non other then a lady inspector. After the Mayor of San Francisco is taken its up to Harry and his new partner are expecting to find him. All and all I give this movie 8 weasel stars.  <br /> <br />

The critics of such movies will disclaim all the flaws they see- but the picture as a whole is a fast paced action/ drama showing epic proportions. The older movies of this type were NOT using computer graghics but many other resourceful means to make the shots look as good as they could. Enjoy and follow the action.
1582701709|2.0|This book begins with the very bold claim that its central thesis is a message common to all of the major religions, ancient civilizations and secret societies throughout history.  Okay, then, how about some source material to back that up?  How about a few footnotes, references, an extensive bibliography perhaps?  Nope, not here. What you get instead are a lot of colorful graphic icons and quotes from new age fad authors, corporate motivational speakers and the like; pretty much all of them westerners, and nary a single religious leader, scholar or even archaeologist among them. <br /> <br />Now I'm not saying that the religions of the world don't make any reference to this idea, nor am I saying that there's nothing to the Law of Attraction or Self Hypnosis, Positive Thinking, Creative Visualization, or whatever else you want to call the 'Secret' which has been on bookshelves in one form or another since before my grandmother picked up Norman Vincent Peale.  But does this book bring new depth or clarity to the concept?  None that I can see.  What it seems to bring is a clever marketing angle. <br /> <br />It reminds me of the old cliche about the charlatan who places an ad in the newspaper: 'Send me a dollar and I'll send you the secret to obtaining untold riches!'  His marks all receive a postcard that states, 'Do as I do.' <br /> <br />Books of this type always seem to sprinkle in a few quotes by Jesus and Buddha taken out of the context of their respective philosophical systems.  This is particularly troublesome when even a rudimentary familiarity with the doctrine of karma raises all kinds of questions about the primacy of the law of attraction.  An exploration of such issues would have been interesting, but you won't find it here.

B0009SOFFY|5.0|With the follow up to their eponymous debut, THE STOOGES make that \\"quantum leap\\" one often reads about, and in this case, FUN HOUSE is, in a word, stunning!  Never pleasantly or hilariously \\"dumb\\" like the debut, FUN HOUSE is an amazing and perplexing advancement from that debut record which of and by itself would have sealed THE STOOGES' reputation.  This band was even better than anyone could have ever guessed (though their record sales quickly relegated their two Elektra releases, the debut and FUN HOUSE, to the bargain bin).  FUN HOUSE is jaw-droppingly unforgiving, a punch in the gut, a splash of acid in the face, hard power and hot metal, a lurching monster, referred to as \\"proto-punk\\" because of its influence on every Punk and Grunge band since, but really, such bands are belittled and reduced to mere \\"poodles\\" by this far-end risk that in fact is the most unique record of its era and a hybrid of 50s rock, 60s psychedelia, and that which was as yet unnamed (Punk) and no band has yet matched the achievement.  Few records have predicted the coming decades as FUN HOUSE did in 1970, though typically unrecognized in its time.  As Iggy Pop (a.k.a. Iggy Stooge) himself said, and to paraphrase, THE STOOGES could \\"eat all those poodles for breakfast.\\"  With a scorched earth policy that leaves no listener unscathed, this record is probably one of the most challenging records in the Rock n' Roll catalog, and not for the faint of heart, such as those moments all over the record when one hears Iggy blatantly snorting.  If you ever listened to CAPTAIN BEEFHEART's TROUT MASK REPLICA you might get an idea of the accessibility of \\"L.A. Blues\\" which is a non-song cacophony of horror with the carnivorous animal Iggy loosed, roaring, and stalking the complacent world.  But for the student and lover of Rock n' Roll, this record is a must.  I think the primary reason Rock critics and diehard fans continue to cite THE STOOGES, especially  FUN HOUSE, is because of the foresight of this material.  The experimental aspect of the record is indicative of its era (it is completely un-commercial, but many bands included such material on their records in those days, though, frankly, lame by comparison) yet, like all three of THE STOOGES albums, FUN HOUSE never sounds dated.  Tracks like the sustained tension of \\"Down On The Street\\", the superbly nasty and compelling \\"Loose,\\" the luscious blues of \\"Dirt,\\" the burping, mesmerizing \\"T.V. Eye,\\" and the sucker-punch \\"1970,\\" in which Iggy shrieks \\"...I feel alright\\" ending with a major snort (the sequel to \\"1969\\" when Iggy had \\"nuthin' ta do\\") are supremely realized and uncompromising, and if it weren't for their shocking effect, I'd be wearing a s**t eatin' grin.  One of Rock's great romps, FUN HOUSE  is not for the uninitiated, the timid, or uninspired.  That being said, FUN HOUSE is one of the greatest records of Rock, a whole hell of a lot of fun, possibly my all time favorite, and one of the very few records of Rock that upon listening to for the first time I said to myself, \\"WOW!\\"  In another word, a masterpiece.this material.

B000002AP1|5.0|The title says it all.  This is the way Rock n' Roll was meant to be: fast, sexy, hot, a little scary, fun, catchy, challenging, and a** scorching.  RAW POWER is one of the best records for Rock lovers, but it's not for the weak kneed, lily-livered, or Punk pretenders.  RAW POWER was Kurt Cobain's favorite record and is certainly THE STOOGES most musical effort.  Despite RAW POWER's thin and not-so-greatly recorded sound, this is one of the most powerful and influential records in Rock.  Re-mastered by Iggy Pop himself, this release has suffered a lot of criticism.  I don't really care; it's what we've got to listen to, and the band was great and these performances monumental.  I just want to listen to the music and I love it, imperfect as it may be.  To the casual listener, the record's equal parts accessible and off-putting.  RAW POWER might be my own personal favorite STOOGES album (check out FUN HOUSE, though, if at all interested in this band).  But of their three albums, there is not a less than superb one.  Iggy Pop brings a finesse to this record and production value that is not apparent on the first two STOOGES albums, even if THE STOOGES had to dissolve, reform under Columbia (and be promptly dropped by that label) to make it happen.  I love the orgasmic celeste on \\"Penetration,\\" the sure fire delivery of \\"Search and Destroy,\\" the uncompromising sexiness of \\"Shake Appeal,\\" and Iggy himself has specified that the epic \\"Death Trip\\" was about his expectation that this record would fail, yet once again the record has that ironic insight into the future influence of THE STOOGES few, but extremely important, recordings, as he sings \\"...we're going down in history...\\"

0060752610|5.0|This was a pretty good book on value investing. The problem is that the book is 30 years old, and the examples are a bit dated. The thing is that if people find out that a type of investment strategy is profitable, more people invest in it, which makes it less profitable. This is why his examples perhaps do not still hold today - if people know about these pitfalls, presumably they are avoiding them. But I'm not sure if this is really true or not - sometimes people do not change, even in the face of overwhelming evidence.  <br /> <br />The one thing to take away from this book is that when there is an optimistic spirit in the market, people get carried away, and vice versa. Over time, emotions will always remain as long as people are responsible for trading stocks.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a good intro to investing, but further research into modern statistics needs to follow.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|I have been listening to this outstanding album since my teen years in the 70's, and completely wore out the vinyl on my record long ago! However, buyers should be aware that the remastered CD really lacks the dynamics found on the original LP.  For instance, on Foreplay/Long Time, the organ in the beginning is mixed down too low, and the once-funky clavinet part has completely lost its high end (noise reduction?).  Even worse Tom Sholz's classic sliding echo-y guitar part going into \\"Long Time\\" is mixed so low that I have to strain my ears to hear it!  Even though I can't bear to rate this amazing album anything less than a \\"5,\\" the remastered version is far less than \\"smokin,\\" and I would instead recommend buying the out-of-print CD copy from the 1980's or, even better, the original LP, with the overall sound as it was meant to be heard.
0743289412|2.0|First let me say that I'm a major King fan and have LOVED many of his books, and I loved BAG OF BONES, GERALD'S GAME, DREAMCATCHER, etc., and absolutely live for his short stories and LOVED KINGDOM HOSPITAL and went into mourning when it was axed after one season.  However...<br /><br />I recently read an article in WRITER'S DIGEST about how best to place backstory in one's fiction and that too many writers bring a story to a halt to insert backstory.  Well, LISEY'S STORY, is a great example of how NOT to weave backstory into a novel because it does just that, and there's too much backstory, and it's too detailed and sometimes not interesting.<br /><br />While as a whole, I actually liked the book, but I'll be honest--took me ALMOST four months to read it because I, like many others, got frustrated wading through all Lisey's musings and flashbacks to her life with Scott and constant references to one particular incident in Tennessee while Scott was on a book tour and had to put it down for awhile to read something less convuluted like the handbook to my cell phone.<br /><br />However, when I got to the chapter just after a major altercation, shall we say, with the villain, Mr. Dooley, and King stops the story to go into God knows how many pages of more backstory while we're waiting to see the outcome of this \\"altercation\\" while Lisey is in DANGER of (well, won't say what..don't wanna ruin it for those who haven't read it)...I wanted to lob this 400+ page book through King's window.<br /><br />Sorry, Mr. King, though I still consider you to be my favorite horror writer, however...do yourself a favor and take some of your own advice from ON WRITING--\\"cut out the bad stuff\\", the excess, per se, next time and/or put it somewhere else instead of right in the middle of the GOOD STUFF/ACTION.  Or, perhaps, just sprinkle it liberally in small doses instead of huge muckish lumps that totally impede the freeway of the HERE AND NOW.<br /><br />This book could easily have been around 300 pages, and the plotline itself I really liked, and in the end it almost became more of a fantasy, which was interesting.

B0000025D0|5.0|Hard hitting, thought provoking, intense, emothional... just a few adjectives to describe this true gem.    Every song on this album is classic.  Even the plainest arrangement on the album (Factory) lyrics have a serious bite to them.  The title track is Rock and Roll poetry at it's absolute finest.  Badlands ranks among Springsteen's five best songs, and that's no small accomplishment, yet Promised Land, Racing In the Street, and Prove It All Night are just as good.  The rest of the album is on that same level.  Adam Raised A Cain, Candy's Room, Streets of Fire, and the aforementioned Prove It All Night all have searing (as opposed to soaring) guitar work.  Springsteen's guitar tracks burn a hole deep into your soul.  It's not the flashy guitar god fret flying Van Halenesque style.  It's a style that is filled with raw emotion.  Lyrically, there are only three people in popular music who could be rated as high as Springsteen as a aongwriter.  They are Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Tom Waits. Dylan's peaks have matched Springsteens, but only Waits has been as consistent.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I knew global warming was an issue, I watch the news every once in awhile.  I never bought into those people that say it's a made up phenomenon.  I know that I'm part of the problem, being wasteful and not eco conscience. Honestly though, I never gave it too much thought...until I watched this documentary.  Al Gore delivers his message straight forward, in plain simple language and that message is clear.  Change needs to happen in the way we, mankind, are treating the planet.  Think whatever you want about Al Gore, he'll enlighten you if you don't already know.  Hopefully he'll make you care about this issue and want to see changes made within our government and just maybe, he'll get you to make some changes in your home.  Throughout the film, he shows you time and time again evidence of how global warming is affecting the planet and how our future could be if we don't do something about it now.  Everyone should be made to watch this documentary.
B0000028SR|3.0|Springsteen is my favorite artist, but this album is easily his worst.  If you are, for some reason, dying to by an album released by Bruce in 1992, I'd recommend you get Lucky Town, which is quite superior, though still not on the same level as the rest of his catalog.  There are still some keepers here though.  The title track is vintage U.S.A/Tunnel of Love era Springsteen, which is one reason it was so out of place within the mainstream in 1992.  However, it's a great song.  The real mystery of this album is the studio version of Real World.  When he first performed it in 1990 (two years before) at the Christic Benefit, he played it by himself, accompanied only by his piano.  It was a showstopper, and instantly considered by most of his fans as good or better than anything on Born in the USA.  It was put on the same level as the best tracks off of Tunnel of Love, and possibly even on the same level as his outputs between 1973 and 1982, when his run from The E Street Shuffle through Nebraska were considered timeless rock and roll classics, both by critics and his fans.  The album version, however, is so overproduced that it almost ruins the song, where if you heard that version only you'd probably just skip it, without realising how good of a song it could be.  The rest of the album has a couple of decent tracks, but all suffer drastically from the production.  The biggest problem of this album, along with the production, however, is the amount of filler.  None of Springsteens' previous album contained this much uninspired filler.
B0007M22TI|5.0|For anyone wanting to purchase this DVD or CD please do so. It is not lip-synched at all. All of the women actually sing. Any \\"live\\" concert DVD ever produced has the same problems as the people making the DVD have to take clips from diferent concerts. Long and short, the women do sing/play their own music. The sound you hear may not be from the video you actually see, but it was in fact them performing.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I just received my Sony MDR7506's via UPS about an hour ago. And within two minutes of listening to them I was blown away with the quality of sound they produce. It is the first set of high end phones I have ever owned to date. And now all I am thinking is why oh why did I not purchase a set of these ten years ago? For years now I have only purchased lower end headphones costing no more than thirty dollars. And whats even more sad is I probably spent enough money on them to purchase at least two sets of these Most Excellent headphones.<br /><br />About the only other headphone I had sampled until now was a set of Bose triports. And in all fairness the Bose headphones do produce a nice sound that is fairly well balanced for most listening. However in my own opinion they come nowhere near the level of performance the 7506's are able to belt out. So far I have been sampling them using a higher end portable DVD player. And I am for the first time hearing things in the movie that I never noticed before. I cant beleive the level of clarity and separation I am hearing. I actually feel enveloped in the movie as I watch it. Where as before with my other headphones I was struggling with trying to hear voices one minute and then going deaf from loud bouts of distortion the next. In other words I had to have my finger on the volume control throughout the whole movie. Now I am listening to the movie at full volume and every part of the movie sounds the way it should, the way it was meant to be heard. I almost feel like Im sitting in front of a high end set of home theater speakers being driven by a high end amp.<br /><br />The bass the 7506's produce is simply amazing! It is very precise and tight with no accertainable distorting that I could detect? And this is comming from a portable DVD player as a source!! If this is how good they sound on a portable device I cant wait to plug them into my high end amp!! Not to mention the fact that they only have about two hours of listening time on them. I fully expect the sound quality to only improve as they start to burn in.<br /><br />Oh yes and how can I forget the build quality. Once you get a pair of 7506's in your hands it doesn't take to much of an inspection to quickly realize these babies are built to last! No wonder they havn't changed the design of these headphones in almost two decades! And in the unlikely event that something does break on them? They do have a complete parts support to replace the worn or broken part. They even supply a neat little parts diagram inside the box underneath the headphones.<br /><br />As I stated before my only regret is that I didn't purchase a set of these phones ten years ago. In closing I would like to say that the 100 dollars I spent on these headphones was the best 100 dollars I have ever spent on any piece of electronic equipment hands down! In truth I probably would have gladly spent 200 on them after sampling them. Shoot, at 100 dollars its almost like your ripping sony off? But dont take my word for it, go buy a set of these amazing headphones and see for yourself.<br />  ============BRAVO ZULU SONY================

B00005R2IS|5.0|I remember sneaking into the Forum Theatre in Melbourne as a kid to see this gem (R rated). It is still as good today on the big plasma as back then. The boys come over and watch it every AFL Grand Final day. Glad to see they released this in the States with the original soundtrack. You will be amused to know we in Australia specially purchased your old version to see how it was dubbed. Pretty funny stuff seeing as Mel has a bit of an American accent in the film anyway. Love how it is all shot around where we live in Melbourne. If you liked this, check out Odd Angry Shot, another film not to be missed

B0002DB0FO|5.0|Yes, so I loved the show. Then it was picked up by ABC Family and I did not know it.  I have still not gotten to see the final shows because I was out of the country and we did not have TIVO back then.  How can you release the first season and not release the rest of them.  If any of you want to write an addition plea please do so on ABC Family to get the show back on --- it was replaced at its end by 7th Heaven.  It is not that I don't like 7th Heaven but it is not near the series that EVERWOOD was. <br />Please release the other 3 seasons on DVD.
0312330871|1.0|Don't buy this $12.95 edition with black cover and red images. It has been weirdly edited to remove all references to Indians! There's no explanation  anywhere in the book. Agatha Christie's classic has gone through many editions through more than half a century using the classic \\"Ten Little Indians\\" nursery rhyme and the setting of Indian Island. Then, for some unknown reason, all the Indians were removed in this \\"bogus\\" edition and replaced by soldiers. Readers at least should be given an explanation for such a change. If the references were deemed by some unknown censor to be insulting to Indians, would they be any less insulting to soldiers?? I don't get it. Anyone interested in reading a better version should order the little black paperback with blue images for about half the price. As I have urged my local book store, I will urge Amazon, don't stock this book. I am an English teacher who has taught this book for years, and I am mystified by such an unwarranted and unexplained change.

B0007M22TI|5.0|My son (15) and I had originally watched this program on PBS. I had changed the channel from something completely mindless and thought my son would get disgusted and go to bed. However, he continued to watch and made several comments to me about how he \\"liked\\" Celtic Women. I thought he was being sarcastic, but soon realized he liked the songs, the presentation, and the nice looking Celtic Women. I surprised him for his birthday and got him the DVD. He wants the CD also. The music touched his musical side and he now wants to join choir. It is certainly a very good DVD, no inappropriate content, can be viewed by all family members. I would recommend this for anyone who is tired of seeing too much sex in music and really wants to get back to a beautiful concert and appreciation of good musicians.  Jill

B000M5AJQS|5.0|The Departed is definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and deserves all the accolades that it has received since last fall.  It's certainly Martin Scorsese's best film since Casino.  This movie also does for the Irish mob what Goodfellas and Casino did for the Italian Mafia.  It gives the viewer a close look at the horrible violence, gut-wrenching fear, and unexpected betrayal that comes to anyone involved in this type of business for any length of time.<br /><br />The Departed deals with Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson and based somewhat loosely on the real James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger) who is the head kingpin of the South Boston criminal underworld.  He's smart, charming, and utterly ruthless in how he conducts business.  You never screw around with Costello because he'll kill you in a heartbeat.  Planning ahead for the future, Costello begins grooming a young Colin Sullivan (the older Colin is played by Matt Damon) for a life of crime and to eventually enter the Boston Police Academy so that he'll have a mole inside the police department.  Once Colin makes the grade, Costello helps him to achieve career-making arrests and to advance up the ladder inside the department.  While this is happening, Billy Costigan (played by the underrated Leonardo DiCaprio) strives to rise above his Boston heritage and to make it into the Massachusetts State Police.  Two higher-ups in the state police (played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) see Billy's potential and offer him the opportunity to go undercover and to hopefully infiltrate Costello's criminal network.  To achieve this, Billy is expelled from the State Police Academy under false charges of assault and sent to jail for several months.  When he finally gets out, Billy starts selling drugs on the street with his cousin and quickly comes to the attention of Costello.  Costello remembers Billy as a boy and admired his straightforward father.  This leads to a job offer from Costello, enabling Billy to get his foot inside the door.  From this point on the movie is basically about Billy and Colin doing their jobs as a mole and trying not to get caught.  It won't be long, however, before the two young men realize that both the Mob and the police have come to the conclusion that there's a rat inside their organization.  Both Colin and Billy then play a cat-and-mouth game as they each seek to discover the identity of the other.  The hunt for the mole's identity is intense.  This is the heart of the story and what keeps you glued to the edge of your seat.  You never know what's going to happen next.  And, no matter how you think the movie is going to end, you'll be wrong.  In fact, I was totally blown away by what happened as each twist caught me by surprise, leaving me completely unprepared for the next one.  I was finally left sitting on the couch with my mouth hanging open at the final scene.  Few movies have the audacity to end in such a violent mode.  Only someone like Scorsese could actually pull it off and not lose the audience in the process.<br /><br />The Departed is a tight, fast-paced, character-driven film about the life of crime, betrayal, and the emotional drain it has on everyone involved.  No one is left unscathed.  The performances by all the main actors are superb and deserving of an Academy Award, especially Leonardo DiCaprio.  He captures the emotional turmoil and fear that can literally overwhelm an undercover agent, who teeters on the edge life and death each and everyday.  Martin Scorsese once again proves that when it comes to crime drama, he's one of the top directors working in the business today.  This man finally deserves to win his Oscar for Best Director.  If he doesn't get it for this film, then there's someone very wrong with the Academy of voters for The Departed is one powerful, violent movie that stays with you long after the end credits have rolled.  One last comment that deals with the Irish music that was played at different times during the film.Whenever I heard it, I kept expecting to see Michael Flattery from Lord of the Dance appear, doing his version of the Irish folk dance.  I know that it made me want to get up and dance, which I don't think was its intended purpose.  Finally, the two-disc Special Edition is the one to buy.  The second disc is loaded with extras: a 25-minute featurette on the Real Boston Mob, a 90-minute documentary with Martin Scorsese discussing his life and his most famous films, another 25-minute featurette on how New York City's Little Italy affected Scorsese and his work in the film industry, and a look at several scenes that were deleted from the movie.  The Departed is so good that I'm going to watch it again in just a few minutes.  Usually I like to wait a couple of weeks before seeing a movie for the second time.  Not this one!  Highly recommended!!!<br /><br />Congratulations to Marty Scorsese for winning Best Director for The Departed!!!!heard it, I kept expecting to see Michael Flattery from Lord of the Dance appear, doing his version of the Irish folk dance.

1582701709|3.0|So African Americans suffered hundreds of years of slavery when they could have just thought themselves out of it?  An abused child can envision a loving home and it will manifest?  What about all of the people who suffer from mental illness?  I get what proponents of 'The Secret' are trying to do.  However, one must consider the societal factors that affect all of us and realize that there are many circumstances that are uncontrollable.  Additionally one must consider physical or other related limitations.  For example, I can visualize myself winning American Idol, but it will never happen because I can't sing!  I can envision myself as a prima ballerina, but it will never happen because I can't dance!  My son will never be a jockey because he is too big.  It is common sense that you should strive for what you want, but also realize that things don't just magically happen and there is a concrete reality that is not subject to your fancies.
B00005JPFO|1.0|This movie was a pretty bad adaption of the comics.  With a capable writing and have scenes that make it a R rating, I think Ghost Rider could have been much darker and made for a mature audience. Not to mention that the script FELT that it needed to get many one liners in as possible.  While I think N. Cage is a good actor, this movie didn't give him much to work with.  The story jumps around, the villians seem made for a \\"B\\" flick and I don't see much chemistry between ANY of the actors/acteresses.  Don't waste your time on this movie, the only thing good about is was watching the preview for 300.  Either wait for the DVD or skip it all together.
B00007G1ZC|4.0|In \\"Dreams,\\" some of Kurosawa's most fundamental beliefs are presented to us in eight artistic and visually stunning vignettes. <br /> <br />The first dream, \\"Sunshine Through the Rain\\" is about a young boy who is warned by his mother not to go into the woods and look upon the wedding of the foxes.  The boy disobeys his mother and when the foxes discover that he has seen them they send a message to his mother that he must commit suicide for his transgression.  <br /> <br />Kurosawa's pro-environmental stance is beautifully illustrated in the dream segment \\"The Peach Orchard.\\"  After being laid waste by human hands nature allows an innocent boy to enjoy the beautiful sight of a peach orchard returning to full bloom once more, after which the orchard returns to its devastated state.   <br /> <br />\\"The Blizzard\\" is a story of human endurance stretched to its limits as one by one climbers caught in a blizzard on a mountain succumb to the storm and die.  Although it is a bleak story, the \\"snow fairy,\\" (probably death), appears to the last survivor and helps to guide him into the land of the dead without his feeling overwhelmed by the futility and desperation of his final moments. <br />   <br />An officer, the sole survivor of his unit, journeys home grief stricken after the war in \\"The Tunnel.\\"  As he approaches a tunnel a \\"snarling centennial,\\" (dog), comes out of the tunnel towards him.  Afraid, but driven to continue on his journey, the solider enters the darkness of the tunnel.  As he exits he hears the sound of marching approaching him from inside the tunnel he has just left and is confronted by his dead comrades.  They are not aware that they are dead and the conversations between the living and the dead are heart wrenching.   <br /> <br />In \\"Crows,\\" a visitor to an art museum enters the Vincent Van Gogh, (played by Martin Scorsese), painting \\"Wheat Field with Crows.\\"  In an almost humorous scene, Van Gogh tells the visitor that, \\"Yesterday I was trying to do aself-portrait, but the ear kept getting in the way.\\"   Soon Van Gogh is off traipsing through the landscape with the visitor trying to keep up with the elusive artist.  The colors and landscape we encounter in this dream are breathtaking!  <br /> <br />\\"Mount Fuji in Red\\" tells of the horror and devastation surrounding the people of Tokyo as nuclear plants explode releasing their deadly mother lode and there is no place to go to escape the situation, except into the sea.  Horrified citizens are in a state of shock and disbelief that their government had lied to them, having reassured them that \\"Nuclear plants were safe.\\"   <br /> <br />In \\"The Weeping Demon\\" man succumbs to the insanity of nuclear war.  The earth, as we know it, has been destroyed.  As a result of the high levels of radiation, the earth and its remaining inhabitants have mutated into what can only be described as a \\"hellish\\" nightmare.  <br /> <br />And finally, in \\"The Village of the Watermills\\" a young man stumbles across a picturesque village and an old man sitting by watermills.  Technology has skirted around the village and the young man is in awe of the clean air and clean water.  The villagers' balanced lifestyle and their living harmoniously within the bounds of nature affords them long and healthy lives.  There is a funeral going on at the time of the young man's visit and the villagers are celebrating and joyful.     <br /> <br />I loved this movie.  It is beautiful to look at and eloquently espouses some of the beliefs of one of the truly gifted directors of all time.  He was a man who deeply believed in tradition and honor, who took humankind's role as steward of the earth seriously; who believed that technology for technology's sake is not necessarily a good thing, and who believed war to be an abomination.   <br />
0307341542|4.0|Creepy. Made even more so by its plausibility and the dispassionate scar flensing that reveals the story of mean girls in a cliquish Missouri town where no one is living the life they long to live.<br /><br />Camille Preaker is a ethargic reporter from a third rate Chicago paper sent to cover a pair of murders in her small hometown. No one seems to like her much, perhaps least of all her mother. There is little love evident anywhere in this place, the main business of which is slaughtering hogs. Cruelty to others, whether in the form of delicious, malicious gossip or overt violence, is the selected substitute for affection. You may not have love, but at least you and your friends all disparage the same people.<br /><br />The tone of the book and, in this case the delivery of the reader, is resigned acceptance. Camille is slogging through life because she can't quite summon the energy to end it. If she were to pick up a razor some less lethal stretch of skin than that across her wrists and forearms would likely distract her. She would add a word to her bloody lexicon and stave off suicide one more time.<br /><br />Yes, and this is the heroine. We like Camille, a pretty girl who would do anything for our approval. Anything. She is a raging drunk with the self-esteem of a sewer rat who will use the appeal of her body to win the slightest favor. We know why she is this way from the beginning of the book, but we do not know the depths her pathology until the<br /><br />end.<br /><br />You may lose some sleep over this one, if only from reading just one, just one more chapter.
B0000013GT|5.0|This CD is tight on all levels. Beats, Lyrics, Production. It's all good. If you don't got it, pick it up. Outkast is called Outkast because they are different than other rappers, different than any artist of any genre for that matter. I don't see any of their CD's as being their best, because all their CD's are their best. It is their second CD, but it sounds like it could have been made this year. Andre paints pictures with his words, he's got an unseen imagination, and he's a true artist. Big Boi has real tight flows. Pick this up for sure, You definately wont be disappointed if you like that real rap music and have respect for creativity. ~If you like the style they got on this, Aquemini has a similar style. So get that too.~
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Wow, what a movie, what a cast.  Should win a lot of Oscars.  Best movie I've seen in years.  A bit overplayed by jack Nicholson and his really poor opinion of women, but if you can get past the language, great movie.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If the Climate Change-deniers had presented their spiel with as much slickness and professionalism as David Guggenheim had,then Al Gore would still be known as the failed Presidential Candidate who was beaten by George Bush. Unfortunately for them, Al Gore got there first. <br /> <br />On the face of it, the subjects this documentary presents really aren't all that appealing. It's on Climate Change Science. Presented by Al Gore. A combination which has the potential to be incredibly yawn inducing and unappealing. The kind of combination so staid that it would dissaude people from believing Global Warming even existed. It's one of the reasons why I've delayed seeing this documentary until this very moment. <br /> <br />And I wish to God I hadn't. <br /> <br />Because the actual result, considering its content, is an astonishing success. There's very effective use of slick montages, both of the effects of Climate Change, Climate Change critics, and the life of Al Gore himself. None of that would've worked so effectively, however, if the presentation itself hadn't worked. Much to my amazement, Al Gore does a terrific job presenting his case. He is so different from the lifeless automaton of the 2000 Presidentail Election. Here, he is passionate, articulate, and with a gentle sense of humor as well.  <br /> <br />In summary, if you're a Climate Change denier, this film is recommended because it's important to know what you're arguing against. If you're interested in seeing a terrifically presented documentary on an unappealing subject, get this DVD now. You won't regret it.
B0006L16N8|2.0|2 stars is for the # of songs I can actually stand on this CD.  I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great.  This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount.  Too bad.  I don't recommend it.

0743289412|4.0|I was so glad this turned out to be a good book. Since I was disappointed by the Cell, I was really looking forward to a good old fashioned King spookfest, and I got it with this book. It is also a love story which is part of what makes it so spooky. But the story is mostly about the relationships that people develop after spending many years with each other. Not just married people, but family too. It makes you think about how people take each other for granted. This is an awesome book, one I'm sure I will read again because I enjoyed the story so much.
0618680004|4.0|The God Delusion is a hugely enjoyable read (in a difficult-to-put-down sort of way), and also one of the better (introductory) books on the philosophy of religion I have read (even though I bet Dawkins never intended to write one). Quite simply, it offers a clear, perceptive and witty perspective on all the topics it covers...<br /><br />Although Dawkins is an atheist, he writes respectfully about the religious issues he covers. He also writes in an informative and clearly informed way. If atheists want to recommend a book to their religious friends for thought and discussion, this is a good starting point. 'Atheist rants' such as Sam Harris' Letter to a Christian Nation pale into comparison (and should be avoided).<br /><br />Although this book has been written by a committed atheist, I believe it should inspire theists around the world to find better ways to 'prove' what they believe is true - namely that God exists! For me,  The God Delusion adequately exposes the now tired and familiar 'tricks' (arguments) theologians and philosophers of religion regularly use, to 'prove' that God exists (e.g. design, cosmology, morality etc.). For me, Dawkins competently shows that there are other ways of explaining why things are as they are in the world, which do not require us to believe in God.<br /><br />'Why is God considered an explanation for anything? It's not - it's a failure to explain, a shrug of the shoulders, an 'I dunno' dressed up on spirituality and ritual. If someone credits something to God, generally what it means is that they haven't got a clue.' (p.134)<br /><br />My only criticism of the book (which is why I gave it 4 stars), is that having argued throughout that it is not good for people to be religious, that he ends by encouraging religious parents to raise their children in an informed manner, such that they choose to be religious, rather than forced to be. My only guess is that he means that in being so informed that children would choose not to be religious (as he testifies to in his own upbringing). Yet this is unexplained, and maybe something Dawkins could address in a future volume - if he writes one, which I dearly hope he does!to be religious (as he testifies to in his own upbringing).

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine si one of the best comedies of 2006. It follows the journey of thsi very dysfunctional family as it travels to California in an old yellow Volkswagon van. This film has a variety of different characters with each of them having a personality of their own. There's the anal father who just wants his kids to be winners. (He wont' stand for them being losers, probably becasue he is somewhat of a loser himself). THe foul-mouthed grandfather, played by Alan Arkin, and the teenage son who refuses to speak until he gets into flying school. Oh yes, he also hates everyone. It has a smartly written script that is clever and original with some very funny moments in it. I found Little Miss Sunshine to be one of the best comedies of 2006. It is a real pleasure.

B000002I6X|5.0|This was better to my ears than Stills 1st album when it came out and it still is. Does it make my heart dance and leap for joy? Yes, it does...and that is about all the critiquing elements I enlist for doing a review. An album either sounds simply horrible and dead (1 star), about half of the album is good (3 stars), almost there (4 stars), or it is there (5 stars). This one is there. The first was only 3 stars to me.
B000002I53|5.0|This is genuine music that soothes the soul. The album consists of 4 songs (all of which are beautiful). My favorite tracks are \\"Summertime\\" and \\"My Favorite Things,\\" but the entire album sends a feeling of achieving a sort of soul- filled nirvana. Great album.

1400044162|5.0|I could not put this book down! The story grabbed hold of me immediately and soon I was living in the lives of the main characters. There are many ways to look at this book: it is a love story; a history; about African culture; about starvation; a war story; a book about families and loyalty; it is about facing fatal horror and trying to find meaning; it is literature; and it is a keeper.<br /><br />The plot cannot be condensed into one theme or story. It is about loving someone with whom you have real and painful differences, the heartache, companionship, and ultimately, acceptance of each other and of the love that you have. It is about how disparate members of a family cope with plenty and with poverty. It takes you into the war for Biafra and the details are harsh, stark, and they make you pause.<br /><br />Adichie presents us with an honest story; there are no happy endings; many compromises. This is the beauty of the story - it is honest, real, lyrically relentless in depicting a point in time that was a shame of a nation; of a world.<br /><br />Adichie's novel will haunt you and it will stand the test of time.
B000089CJI|5.0|Give Up is the perfect combination of laid-back, relaxing, feel good music. It's also one of those rare CDs that you can put in and actually let play from start to finish because there isn't a bad track on the entire album. Personally I love Nothing Better and Sleeping In, but if you want some unobtrusive music to listen to while studying or as background music no matter what you're doing, look no further than this album.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Moody, monochromatic and paranoid this movie is a great riff on 1984, Farenheit 451 and The Matrix. Christian Bale gives one of his signature performances as a Bell's Palsy sufferer. Sean Bean glowers. Still, the movie is well-enough crafted to prevent outright laughter at the concept of \\"gun kata\\" - a futuristic \\"martial art\\" wherein a highly trained lone ninja/priest standing in the center of a circle of gunmen spewing bullets can simultaneously avoid the intense crossfire while dispatching all of the surrounding adversaries - obviously a concept created by someone whose lost touch with reality.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I was transfixed by this set of DVD's. <br />The subject matter was fascinating and the use of a different person's perspective in many of the episodes was great. <br />I would highly recomend this set to anyone interested in history particularily WWII. <br />One warning, there are some \\"R\\" moments.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|\\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" is a fascinating movie. Its title is very adequate - in literal translation, it means \\"Spanish Inn\\", but in colloquial French, L'Auberge Espagnole describes a crash of different cultures. Both of these meanings link to the movie very well.<br /><br />The movie follows a post-graduate exchange student, Xavier (Romain Duris) , on his trip to Barcelona, and the extraordinary moments he there witnesses. The title refers to the apartment he is staying, packed with students from all over Europe, and the chaos in which these weird, but lovable people live. All these people are very different and well played by the multinational cast. Throw in the equation Xavier's jealous ex-girlfriend Martine (foolishly first-billed, but lovely Audrey Tautou), his new crush, the beautiful lesbian Soledad (Cristina Brondo) and his third love interest, the painfully shy Anne-Sophie (Judith Godr&egrave;che), and you've got an amazingly entertaining, at times depressing, but always very meditative movie, \\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\". It is a wonderful celebration of youth every young person should see.
B00005JOLI|2.0|Oh for all that is holy, when this comes out on DVD, please let it be an extended version.  For what was shown, despite all the visuals and elements, was pathetic in terms of plot and character development.  They NEEDED to spend another hour of the movie telling us more about the characters and world.  It just felt like it lacked a whole of bunch.
B000M341QE|5.0|I watch alot of foreign movies. \\"Infernal Affairs\\" is in my Top 5 List.  So when a stellar cast of movie actors/diector/procuction/engineers took this on in the form of THE DEPARTED I couln't wait. The film follows the original very closely. The love interests and ending are different.  <br />Having just finished the non-fiction book The Brotherhoods about the mafia cops in The New York Police Department, this plot of placing undercover crime members into police organizations is the real deal.  Jacks performance is great but of course one always wants more, after all he sets a high bar. Because of the high profile this movie has taken on I've found out there is a prequel and sequel to \\"Infernal Affairs\\" and that's where I'am going next.   <br />For those who have not seen the foreign version- Your going to have a GREAT TIME!!!
0743289412|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I started reading because it sort of sounded like Bag of Bones in reverse, but the story was obviously quite different and I really enjoyed Lisey's Story. I can see how King's intense and redundant vocabulary would frustrate some, but I am luckily not part of that crowd. I found it sweet and I think it gave the novel character. The descriptions of Boo'Ya Moon were amazing, the flashbacks to Scott and Lisey's time together were heartbreaking, the stories of Scott's childhood were disturbing and the present action with Lisey's sister was touching.  <br /> <br />If you read King solely for the horror, this is not for you. Although there are some intense scenes, that's simply not what this book is about. If you enjoy a good story, romance or no, check it out.
B000M341QE|3.0|Martin Scorsese  should get his long overdue Oscar,but this Fim isn't on par with His best overall works,but he is overdue. the Acting&overall pacing was Good in this film. the story was pretty easy to pick up on. it ran a bit too long&the Music didn't really run with the film as have past Scorsese films.very watchable film&has some interesting moments.
B000AP04FG|1.0|If this is an example of the projects America's highest paid actors are choosing, I have some serious concerns.  There is no substance; no redeeming value of any kind here.  My guess is the film is attractive to teens who either want to be Pitt and marry Jolie or vice versa.  The actors mumble through the few lines and the rest is \\"shoot em up.\\"  Waste of time.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|this film from straight to finish had my full attention. all the many twists&turns in the family van alone  will keep you focused on what is going on.a very Dysfunctional Family that has so much character that you won't forget what happens next.  very well written&Developed film.
B000KQGP2G|2.0|Uhh, another disappointment from POS.  I loved the first four albums but I didn't have much love for \\"BE\\", it was way too self-indulgent and meandering.  Alas \\"Scarsick\\" is even worse, I think Daniel has forgotten the point of music is to entertain, not to preach.  Even if you agree with his viewpoint, do you really want to hear his opinion of Stairmasters with a spoken word interlude?  A little subtlety would go a long way guys.    Scarsick - the albums opening track is also one of few I enjoy, its a bit nu-metalish with Daniel rapping all the verses, still the chorus is pretty good with nice harmonies.    Spitfall - Wow, horrible, Daniel's ode to rappers.  Rap video's used to really annoy me too..  when I was 13!  The concept of this song is just plain juvenile and I can't believe we've got rapping on the first two tracks of a POS album.  The chorus is actually pretty good, but I can't bring myself to listen to this song ever again.   yo bro!!??.    Cribcaged - is that Daniels baby gurgling at the start, please bury it deeper in the mix if you must indulge yourself.  This song is like listening to the guy at work that likes to complain about everything, truly a depressing and worthless expletive filled track.    America - a slightly better track, its actually musical!  America bashing is quite popular now, I don't think its fair to single them out though, there is no such thing as a benevolent superpower, people are all the same everywhere, power corrupts, Swedes too!    Disco Queen - how did this cringe inducing track find it way off the cutting room floor?  it sounds like it was written for a interactive kids TV show.    Kingdom Of Loss - the problem with spoken word tracks is they have no shelf life, once is enough.  I don't find the overstated opinions engaging at all, more would be less.  Take for example Devin Townsend's 15 line nugget \\"Hide Nowhere\\".     Mrs. Modern Mother Mary - Lyrically I like this song, but no hooks, no melody and just a repetitive andannoying riff.    Idiocracy - Pretty good song, sounds more like a demo, with a re-worked chorus this could have been a great track.    Flame To The Moth - Sorry can't get past the screaming, it sounds horrible and wrecks the song.    Enter Rain - This records saving grace, this track has it all most notably a great vocal performance from Daniel.
B000E9910W|4.0|finally Rhino Records got it right by bringing in a Double Set of the Doobie Brothers. the Liner Notes, the Sound&everything  is very well done here.  this Collection combines Album Favorite tracks with all the Doobie brothers Biggest Hits.  this is a Must have for any Doobie Fan.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|I became a DOORS fan way back when they released their first album. Forty years later most of their music still bends my ear.  This elaborate box set is worth seeking out, especially given the limited numbers available.  I read some reviews about the CD remixes that were disappointing.  Well, folks, they were wrong.  And if that's all you're looking for they are being released as single CDs in the very near future.  I wanted this for the DTS DVD AUDIO discs that bring this set to twelve discs. Nevermind the historic but boring videos tagged on.  The DTS surround sound  is nothing less than stunning.  From Strange Days through LA Woman, the recordings were obviously meant to be heard this way. The remixes only enhance my favorites.  And this begs my next plea: I have this set, I have Talking Heads Dual Disc BRICK, and Pet Sounds, and the Beatles LOVE, and Lyle Lovett's JOSHUA JUDGES RUTH, Richard Thompson, etc., all in 5.1 surround and/or DTS.   I would really enjoy the Beatles catalogue in DTS, as well as most of Joni Mitchell's catalogue. And Michael Jackson, Dwight Yoakam, Steely Dan, Tom Waits, and any other artist whose music is marked by originality AND impeccable recordings.  The success of PERCEPTION should be a positive indicator that there are tons of music whackos like me willing to shell out hard cash for items like this.  All you record companies that are so worried about pirating and downloading?  Not us! Give us what we want, (and these aren't downloadable)!  Win win! Sony dropped the ball bigtime with SACD, don't let us down like they did!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|It proved itself in season 1!  Buy it and you won't regret it!  Each character plays off of each other so well.  The show is seamless in that there's great continuity!
B000MG1YBG|5.0|American culture will eat this up. If marketed right. I feel so much Freddie Mercury in Mika's voice, and the music is very Queen like. Im a new fan.
B0002XV2WK|4.0|This CD is a 1999 live America performance which was broadcast on German TV. It originally appeared as a bootleg CD entitled \\"Live In Germany '99\\". In November of 2001 it was released on a German DVD titled \\"In Concert - Ohne Filter\\" by In Akustik and as a domestic release in March of 2002 by Music Video Distributors.  A nice performance and it includes several songs from their 1998 CD \\"Human Nature\\" that they rarely perform any more including \\"Wednesday Morning\\", \\"Pages\\", \\"Wheels Are Turning\\", and \\"From A Moving Train\\" which was a number 1 hit in Europe.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Just..this is one of the best movie in the world...
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Once in a while a movie comes along that totally tears apart the society that spawned it thru the use of wit, irony, sarcasm and pointed remarks.  This comedy is one of these movies.  The movie revolves around the life and career of Nick Naylor, PR person for Big Tobacco, and begins with him taking on and taking out his political opponents live on a national talk show.  We then come to see him comment and explain his work to his son, his son's classmates, his counterparts in the alcohol and firearms industries, his boss, and unfortunately for him, an investigative reporter with a knack for twisting words every bit as much as him.  Put together, we see the tobacco industry and the PR industry stood on its head and examined from the top down.   <br /> <br />Though smooth, ironies abound in the life of Nick.  First, his ex-wife is now married to a doctor who hates smoking.  Second, his opponents in the health care industry and Congress actually make him invaluable to Big Tobacco by their efforts to limit smoking.  Third, he uses the most roundabout reverse psychology possible to bribe an ex-smoker into keeping mum about the hazards of tobacco use.  Watching the movie from beginning to end, and seeing how the foes and friends of tobacco act, we get an interesting, and funny, examination of American society.  All in all, a great movie.  It is rated R for sex scenes between the protagonist and Katie Holmes' character, but nothing is shown so the movie is appropriate for anyone in their teens and older.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Good Music- great sound and a fresh look at Irish music and technical capabilities.  Behind the scenes look was very good.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I got this for Christmas and spent entire break in front of the TV!  The Extras include trivia games which are made for FRIENDS fanatics like me.  the gag reels made me laugh until i cired.  I love FRIENDS and this was the best Christmas gift I have EVER recieved!
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Even if \\"the Confession Tour\\" is far from the magical \\"Girlie Show\\", and even if I'm still saying Thank you Madonna for the unforgettabile night in Rome, I think this show, is the perfect one for scenes, lights, videos, coreographies, energy and fun she gave us. <br />It's a chance to see her, to know her, to listen to her in a different way we used to do. Don't loose this opportunity. <br />It's a magic way to introduce us in her magic world ...Let's forget your life, Forget your problems, Administration, bills, and loads. <br />....Would you like to try?  <br />
1596680199|5.0|I love this book.  I love all my polymer clay books, but usually most have many techniques that cover many different projects from vessels to figures.  I always find useful information, but this book is EXACTLY what I've been wanting.  I love beads and aside from a few cat figurines I've made with my 8 y.o. daughter, that's what I make.  THANKS!!  Ms. Blackburn.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!
0679745203|2.0|While I loved the movie, the book left me dry and perplexed. Normally I prefer the book to the movie, but in this case, it was the other way around. The story jumps around a great deal and you live in the heads of Hana, Caravagio and Kip, but only graze upon those of Catherine and Almasy. If you expect to read about that great romance, better just rent the video because it's not in the book.
B000M341QE|4.0|The acting is amazing and the story will never be forgotten. Gritty but alluring. It makes us want to watch how two men that came from the streets of the city are drawn to the state police. We see they have very different ideas about crime even though they come from very similar backgrounds. The action is non-stop and will have some biting their nails as the tension mounts. One cop is dirty while the other pretends to be. Will the pretend criminal or dirty cop be found out? What will happen to them if they are? Superb cast, great sets and camera work, and decent music make it a must see for adults. Fans of cop movies like \\"13th Precinct\\", \\"French Connection\\", and \\"Serpico\\" won't want to miss it.<br /><br />This is one of the best dramas I have seen in years. Scorsese once again shows us what a master he is as a director. Nicholson, Damon, and DiCaprio deserved Oscars let alone nominations at he very least. Although Walberg is great as always, he is not on the screen all that much as the other three in this movie. I'm glad he got a nomination, but the other three were robbed. They make you feel their roles and pull you into this riveting story of how two kids from the streets grow up fighting to make it. Their lives are messy and they try to keep them together the best they can. The complexities of characters here makes for excellent acting. Don't miss this one. I recommend this for buying if you enjoy crime dramas.
B000HIVOI2|2.0|I am a fan of this movie but the Blu Rau version does not \\"cut the mustard\\", so to speak. First the picture is very grainy but sharp. I would say this is due to the original print, not the format of disc. The sound is good. The subtitles on this disc are messed up. You have to turn the subtitle on to get them (for ancient egyptian), but then you get the subtitles for english as well. The DVD \\"Ultimate\\" version is the best copy of this movie out right now. The level of detail from the Blu Ray disc is not great enough to warrent an upgrade if you own this version on DVD. I believe my favorite version of ths movie was the laser disc version, it toned down the grain, held a sharp picture, and the sound rocked, better than the DVD versions.
B000M4RG42|4.0|It is hard for most to visualize what they truly went through at Iwo Jima. This gives us a snapshot of what it was like. The movie shows not only the grim reality of the battle but the psychological impact of war. Sort of a cross between great combat scenes of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and the media blitz of the air crew in \\"Memphis Belle\\". I think most of us feel it doesn't matter which flag they raised. It matters that they were there and no matter what their duties they risked their lives for freedom from those that would enslave and kill without remorse. No glossy coating of what happened, but the truth.<br /><br />Like the men of the Memphis Belle, three men of the six that raised the second flag at Iwo Jima are honored as heroes and brought home to do a War Bond tour. They feel uncomfortable being praised when the others from the first flag raising and second are all dead. Not to mention the fact that so many that had nothing to do with the flag raising risked their lives or gave the ultimate sacrifice to take the island. We see the tremendous toll it took on their lives and part of the horrors they saw on Iwo Jima. Not an easy movie to view and certainly not for the whole family. A movie that should not be missed if for no other reason than to remember and honor those that gave up so much to protect their brothers in arms and our country.
0393327655|4.0|In this book Mr. Harris paints a bleak future for a world in which religion plays a significant role. The first few chapters were cohesive, thoroughly engaging and chock full of meaningful quotes I simply had to write down in order to remember them later. While the later chapters took a more philosophical turn that I didn't find nearly as interesting and that felt only tangentially related to the subject, I still recommend this to others who consider themselves reasonable, intelligent thinkers. Also recommended is Harris' companion work, 'Letter to a Christian Nation.'<br /><br />It is a relief to see more books on this topic being published, asking -- pleading with, perhaps -- the human populace to bring *reason* back into intelligent thinking when it comes to faith and religion, before we destroy ourselves.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|A story which grabs and pulls you in from the first frame.  With a surprising climax in the tradition of Sleuth and Deathtrap.  Anything with Paul Giamati is got to be good, and the score by Philip Glass is excellent.  Recommended, two thumbs held high up!
0307236722|5.0|There wasn't a ton of cooking in my house growing up. As far as baking goes, I have always had to fly with a blindfold on and the results have been both good and bad. Finally, this book comes along. The recipes are swell but what REALLY sells me on this book is the technical stuff. I've never had any training and I have no relatives to get this stuff from. It's nice to finally have a book in the kitchen that explains why one should only beat batter for a few minutes instead of ten. Now I \\"get it\\".  Today's creative project - decorating the yellow cake with chocolate icing!
0060832819|1.0|This book is simply unfortunate. Firstly, if this book is the first book you have read by this author, and if you are so disappointed by it that you do not want to read any of his other work you will be doing yourself a grave disservice. When Coelho writes from his heart and not his vanity he is an amazing storyteller. Thus, this book is not representative of some of his previous work, which is quite excellent. With this book it seemed that he felt that people love his books so much that they would also love reading about his process in writing his books, and not just that he uses the book as an autobiographical tale. Major problems for me with this book were that clearly the author and the main male character are one in the same. Coelho never admits this, but he has flagrantly made the character so similar to himself that it is insanely ridiculous that he is not recognizing this as an autobiography of some sort. Secondly, the characters are dreadfully and tediously boring, and mentioning the Eiffel tower, his success, fame, money, loyal readership, and open marriage a gazillion times doesn't change this fact. Thirdly, he somehow has convinced himself that breaking up with someone that you have spent a decade of your life with, and then thinking about them and missing them is obsessive instead of a natural part of grieving a broken heart, this makes the whole zahir story line quite ridiculous. Fourth, what has come across as bits of insightful wisdom in his other books seem forced and contrived in this story, because everything else in the book is so ludricrous. Lastly, the story of his missing/runaway wife made no sense to me, and no matter how much I tried to sympathize with something in the storyline I was not able to. If you are interested in knowing many details, however boring they may be, about the author's life this book will fulfill what you are looking for. Otherwise, I agree that it really is something to be borrowed, because paying for this book would bea sad waste of money, and you would already be wasting your time by reading it. Why waste both.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|A friend provided a care package of movies before a rather lengthy business trip. He included this movie knowing that I love the genre and told me that this would most likely be a new favorite. The movie they showed on the plane was [..], so I popped the disc into my laptop and lo and behold!! I watched it 2 more times while I was on my business trip and thought it was more brilliant each and everytime. It's funny and heartbreaking and heartwarming and funny and thrilling and funny. But the best part is..It's FUNNY!! I mean hilariously so. The action scenes are well choreographed, but don't look choreographed. The acting is superb. I love this movie! My husband and I never get tired of watching, now the kids watch and love it too.
0618680004|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It we got rid of religions, all of this fighting, and these wars would stop.
B000LC4CVA|1.0|Zero or less stars. I have never entered a review about any DVD that I have ordered via amazon.com but thus DVD (0 946 3 75106 98) is the worst. I intended to order at least two more copies for friends but not now. These women are beautiful and talented but because of the packaging the sound out of their mouths doesnt't match their lips. Very disturbing. A simple effect to make happen, I would assume, but these bozos obviously can't. Don't buy it.
1582701709|5.0|Long before I ever read this book, \\"The Secret\\" was working for me, I just didn't know it. First time was when I was on a first date with my husband and I said to myself \\"I am going to marry this man\\" sure as day. Despite all odds - long distance relationship, his not wanting to get married, not wanting to marry ME... he was already mine in my mind. Now we've been happily married twenty years. Second time is when I began visualizing myself in a big beautiful house in a beautiful neighborhood. This is when we were living in a broken down, tiny shack. I then saw my dream house and claimed it immediately saying \\"this is MY house\\". Never mind that it was almost 4 million dollars, it was mine (in my mind anyway). The only problem was we had no money saved. I said the entire time we were trying to buy this house that there are forces working to help us buy this house. I could feel it - when one door closed, another opened ... and sure enough I am now living in my dream house. I then read the book and it had all been so obvious, I just didn't think about it. I started imagining checks coming to me (to help pay off that big mortgage!) and acting generous like I had money like the book says and this morning my husband called to tell me he got quite a hefty raise today. Believe it's yours and you will get it!
B000H5TVJY|2.0|I'm a little ticked at LionsGate, I thought the shaky picture quality of the first wave of Blu-ray's was a thing of the past, now this. There is \\"ringing\\" and dirt in this transfer and I think given the limited number of Bluray titles out there, they ought to make a more concerted effort at keeping the quality higher than this. I guess I was expecting more, and reading the faint praise of the other two reviews, I see it's not just me.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Three sons grow up under the authority and love of a libertarian father.  They fall in love with the same woman and sibling rivalry takes on a devastating turn.  Each brother attempts to find his place in the world whether it be with the accepted norms of society, the revolutionaries, or the extreme individualist anarcho-libertarian life.  Each pays a heavy price for his choice.  A moving tale of relationships, government, and belonging.  The Montana scenery is as much a star as any of the main characters.  A wonderful piece of work that will leave you pondering the intricate plot themes.
B000M341QO|5.0|Read this review only if you can't wait until you get your copy to find out what the plot is all about.<br /><br />The police are looking for a rat within their ranks.  Their rat is Matt Damon's character.  Matt is working for the mob, led by Jack Nicholson's character.  The mob is also looking for a rat within the mob.  Their rat is Leonardo DiCaprio's character. Leonardo is a deep, under-cover police detective who is supposed to find out about a stolen supply of computer micro-processors.  Leonardo finds out that Jack Nicholson's character is, besides being a mob boss, an informant for the FBI.  This is important because later in the movie, Matt Damon shoots Jack because he knows that Jack is planning on giving up some of his mob people to the FBI.  Leonardo finds out that Matt Damon is the rat and tries to arrest him but instead Leonardo gets shot by a guy who is \\"on the take\\" for the mob.  Matt Damon thinks he's off the hook and can go back to his secret life as a police sergeant but then in the last scene Matt Damon is walking into his apartment.  Mark Wahlberg is waiting inside.  Mark walks toward Matt Damon with this matter-of-fact, taking-care-of-business look on his face, doesn't say a word, and shoots Matt Damon in the head.  Then Mark puts a ski mask over his head and casually walks out of the apartment.  He is wearing booties over his feet and gloves so he will not leave behind any forensic evidence. This last scene is worth the price of the movie all by itself.  At the very end, you look out the window of Matt Damon's fancy apartment and you see a rat casually walking by the window.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|This movie was an overall dissapointment considering the hype it got from Marvel. Iron Man's origins were no where close to his Marvel comic origin. The dialogue was downright cheesy as well as annoying...and not to mention the stereotypical characters! The worst part was that the plot line was so obvious it bore me to death. I am so glad I rented this movie, otherwise I would have bought it. Do yourself a favor and save $15 to get yourself something else.
B00005NDEX|2.0|Paul McCartney's DRIVING RAIN CD is biographical. The opening track deals with painful obsessing since his wife's passing, while \\"From A Lover To A Friend\\" expresses the writer's reluctance to give his heart to another. The album's title cut finds Paul caught up in an exuberant new love. More quite personal songs follow, perhaps to the listener's disadvantage, especially in light of the disintegration of McCartney's second marriage. This is a highly self-possessed album, too much so.<br /><br />The oddly grainy B&W images interspersed among the accompanying booklet's lyrics should have been an object lesson that keeping things vague just may be beneficial to all concerned.<br /><br />TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 67:10
0374105235|5.0|There are, according to UNICEF, over 300,000 children employed as soldiers in various wars around the world.  Ishmael Beah, author of this simple but eloquent memoir, was one of them.  His powerful and disturbing book shows the full range of humankind's capacity for good and evil.      His direct and unadorned language, and the contrast he draws between his happy childhood and the hellish nightmare of a savage civil war in which he was compelled to commit atrocities, make his narrative truly spellbinding. His account is also a testament to the revivifying power of love, which he found after UNICEF workers saved and helped rehabilitate him.     My only criticism is that this book ends too abruptly, with him leaving Sierra Leone for Guinea.  From the book jacket, it is clear that Ishmael Beah accomplished much with his life since leaving Africa.  I would like to have read more about his life in the United States.  I hope he writes again.     This account of a child at war is sad enough to break your heart, but it is inspiring to know that Ishmael has survived. I hope someday no children will have to fight in wars. Better yet, I hope someday no adults will either.
B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison's BRAINWASHED is a remarkable accomplishment, especially in light of his personal circumstances during these sessions. This is an album that will not be forgotten any time soon. Mature introspection, melodic playfulness and anguish, humor and pain-- the stuff of life. It's all here, in what amounts to a brilliant musical summation, lovingly given to all. A profound final work. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />TOTAL PLAYING TIME -- 47:41

B000H5V8DG|4.0|I have read some of the reviews for this item from others. I understand their frustrations when things were not what was expected. The nice thing is that Amazon really took care of me and my issues. When in actuality, the problems were generated by Buena Vista. I don't mean to knock the manufacture, but I think that someone in Quality Control was asleep on the job the day that some of these boxes were assembled.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, you really know how to treat your customers.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"Chariot\\", which I heard every day at work. I love that song, but I had to ask a co-worker who sang it! When the CD arrived, I couldn't wait to play it. I was delighted to discover that the whole CD is excellent, and Gavin DeGraw is no \\"one hit wonder\\". The entire work is great listening. The bonus CD is very good too, although I prefer the original recording, personally.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|This musical program has some of the best talent available today. They present real music, not just electronic noise. Beautiful production with excellent talent not only by the singers but the other performers as well. The violinist has to be the most accomplished ever and the drummers are superb. I have watched this video several times and like it better with each viewing. The entire program seems designed to make us all want to go to Ireland and sing.
0767819543|3.0|What is so unique about CENTRAL STATION is that rarely,if ever,is a woman actress called upon in a leading role as a Dickensesque Fagin-like character,hustling the public,shoplifting,child-selling and running from the law.To see Fernanda Montenegro pull this off IS WORTH THE ENTIRE FILM!!!Some performances just simply are 100% spot-on.Such is the case here.As no one else could ever be Meryl Streep's Sophie in SOPHIE'S CHOICE,so no one else could ever be Montenegro's Dora.It just simply does not get better than this.Her performance is simply arresting.You'll love Dora and you will hate Dora,but one thing's for sure-you will see Dora totally and memorably brought to life by a true actress among actresses.
B000LC55F2|5.0|In magic tricks, whats the point of making something disappear...if you can't bring it back? \\"The Prestige\\" is a truly thrilling tale about two magicians whose ruthless rivalry stems from a tragic accident (for which one blames the other). They cause each other much pain, physically and emotionally, throughout the years of relentless effort to out-do each other in their respective magic shows. However, when one of them stumbles onto a bit of *real*, but dangerous, magic...just how far will he go to utilize it in his show, and take his final prestige with the satisfaction of knowing he has won...<br /><br />From start to finish, this movie will hold you in it's spell. Hugh Jackman and Christina Bale turn in electrifying performances as the battling magicians, and they each compliment each other very well. It wouldn't be difficult for a great performance to get lost among the equally great performances in this all-star cast. Scarlett Johannsen has a supporting role, as does Michael Caine. However, Jackman and Bale each shine more brightly than the others -- and thats the way it should be.<br /><br />In the world of magicians, the end of a magic trick is known as the 'prestige'. For example, if one was performing a trick to make something disappear, the prestige of that trick would be the reappearance of the disappeared item, after which the magician would smile at the crowd and take a bow. In the film, the two magicians battle each other to claim the greatest prestige to the most dazzling trick imaginable...<br /><br />Throughout the film you will see the obsession within each magician grow -- and you will see the price each pays for it. When it comes to obsession, at what point is the price too high? This is a question this film explores. Is the price of your family's suffering too much? How about the use of your hands, arms, or legs? Do you have the courage to hurt yourself? Is any of this too high a price...or will you press on with your obsession until it completely destroys you and those you love?<br /><br />A small sticking point is that the film *does* give the viewer enough clues to deduce the big twist revealed at the end...but that doesn't stop it from being a great twist! Even if you think you've figured it out before the ending, just sit back and enjoy the ride anyway!<br /><br />Bottom line, this film is fantastic, and very well written, directed, and acted. I highly recommend it because you won't be disappointed in this thrill-ride -- it's a real trip...e you love?

B000FIMG68|2.0|I liked the first season but the second takes the most annoying parts of the first and magnifies them ten-fold. <br /> <br />What is this that I hate? The fact that individual characters come upon some secret knowledge, or come into the posession of something vital, and then decide to tell no one about it. For instance, Charlie finds a stash of medicine complete with injector gun. Does he tell Jack the doctor? No. He gives the whole lot to Claire who then decides to regularly administer these to her baby. And she doesn't tell the doctor either. <br /> <br />Like the 'hatch' in the first episode where Locke and Boon decided to keep knowledge of this to themselves the viewer can only be frustrated by knowing more of the picture but seeing the characters stumble from one disaster to another simply because all of them are acting on partial knoweldge. <br /> <br />I was so annoyed by this. I feel several hours of my life were wasted as I waited at least for the last four episodes of season 2 to redeem the series. <br />*spoilers* <br />What would you think if Jack and Sayid had a plan to combat the others involving a sail boat. Only after Jack goes off into the jungle does Sayid run around looking for someone to sail the boat - because he doesn't know how to. Well thought out plan that was!
B000002AS3|5.0|Straight outta Manchester, England comes a breath of fresh air in Oasis.  These guys pour their heart & sould into all their records, and Definitely Maybe stands out against the rest.<br /><br />Most people crown Morning Glory as the best Oasis album, but I gotta tell you, that they are wrong.  Up in the Sky is the only track that I skip over, and this song would be a chart topper for other wanna be bands!<br /><br />The highlights on this album are Columbia & Supersonic and they happen to follow one another (track #5 & #6 respectively) on a solid debute album. It's fitting that they lead off with Rock N' Roll Star.  It's like the Gallagher brother's knew they would hit stardom!  Shakermaker is a great 2nd track as it highlights their musical range!<br /><br />If you like Definitely Maybe, & I know you will, Be Here Now, Morning Glory, & the Masterplan are all excellent Oasis discs to add to your collection!
B000060O58|2.0|These CDs are left-overs from the 1960s when Bach was played by groups of chamber orchestra size on modern instruments. They were thought to be good interpretations at the time, but the sound is muddy, and the music dirge like, even though it is not much slower than a recent recording. Do not buy them, but listen to them if you can and give thanks to the period instrument movement of the early 80s.  There must be 50 recent recordings of these masterpieces that are far superior and far cheaper.    p.s. It would seem from the number of readers who did not like this review, and from comments received, that I have come across as a rabid modern instrument hater. This is not the case, I am more than happy to admit that I enjoy some of the more recent of the modern instrument performances of Bach that have been influenced by the period instrument movement. For example the Naxos series of Bach's complete orchestral works played by The Cologne Chamber Orchestra on modern instruments is very good, their Brandenburgs, particularly nos 3 to 6 are excellent interpretations. They are very modestly priced, too. And I admit to much prefering piano interpretations of Bach's solo keyboard works.

B0000033OZ|5.0|Released in 1970, this excellent debut by ELP brought together keyboardist extraordinaire Keith Emerson (Hammond organ; pipe organ; moog synthesizer; and acoustic piano) (previously with The Nice); Greg Lake (bass guitar; vocals; and acoustic guitar) (from King Crimson); and excellent drummer Carl Palmer (from Atomic Rooster).  All three of these guys were incredible musicians and with this album, ELP established themselves as one of the dominant English progressive rock bands alongside Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, Gentle Giant, Jethro Tull, and Van der Graaf Generator amongst others.  ELP would continue to release innovative and exciting albums up to and including their masterpiece Brain Salad Surgery (1973), although they did release one late period masterwork from 1977 (e.g. Pirates).<br /><br />Although this debut sounds at times like a showcase for Keith Emerson's unbelievable skills as a keyboardist, I feel that Greg turns in some excellent playing/writing and Carl even contributes some music in the form of the excellent instrumental track Tank (6'47\\").  The six pieces on the album include a savage and electrifying adaptation of Bela Bartok's Allegro Barbaro, which has been appropriately re-titled The Barbarian (4'28\\"), along with an excellent adaptation of Janacek's Sinfonietta, which was named Knife's Edge (5'05\\").  Knife's Edge is a fantastic piece and one of my favorites on the album.  Take a Pebble (12'27\\") is perhaps one of the most delicate, large scale compositions that ELP ever wrote and Keith contributes some very nice work on the acoustic piano.  The Three Fates (7'43\\") is a Keith showcase and features his astonishing skills on the acoustic piano and the pipe organ.  Last but not least, we have Greg's melancholy and acoustic tinged smash hit Lucky Man (4'37\\"), which features some nice playing by all members and a great moog solo by Keith.<br /><br />I guess it is worth noting that ELP did not include any of the lighter, humorous pieces that were present on subsequent albums (e.g. Benny the Bouncer, Are you Ready Eddy?) so that this debut has a very even feel to it.  Although speculative, my guess is that the lighter pieces may have been included to placate obnoxious music critics like Lester Bangs, although I don't know this for certain.<br /><br />This remastered CD by Rhino is a little disappointing given their high quality releases for other bands (e.g. Yes, Chicago etc).  Although the sound quality is good, liner notes are absent and there are not any extras like bonus tracks and photos etc.  I have found that at times, the CD extras SOMETIMES enhance the overall experience relative to my original experience with the vinyl record.  I think that this would have been one of those instances.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent debut by an equally excellent English progressive rock band and is highly recommended along with Tarkus (1971); the live Pictures at an Exhibition (1972); Trilogy (1972); and Brain Salad Surgery.re present on subsequent albums (e.g. Benny the Bouncer, Are you Ready Eddy?) so that this debut has a very even feel to it.

B000M5AJQI|5.0|Whassup Amazon.... i bought this movie from Wal-Mart for about $26.00 and I always get $10 off to purchase any blu-ray disc I bought, so which means I actually be getting new blu-ray movies for $15 instead.  I owned four blu-ray movies so far.  Hey, I want to say this movie, The Departed is very entertaining and fun to watch. but not about comedy because it just an New American Crime Classic style...  whatever we call it Gangsta/Crime type of movie, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg makes me laugh alot.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon keep me guessing a lot. I'm pretty glad that Alec Baldwin is in this movie, and he is doing his best and I remembered him from Beetlejuice when he was skinny and look younger... but this movie everyone looks different and does the best job in this movie. I thought Anthony Anderson might kill this movie alittle bit but I dont see any flaw, so I'm glad he is doing great so the movie is flawless victory!! Excellent acting, and picture quality... of course the 5.1 Audio sound from Dobly Digital but I am confused with (PCM 5.1) but anyway buy this movie because it is an recommended for blu-ray.  Holla!!
0689878451|5.0|My husband and I gave the book to our kids for Valentine's Day and have since ordered more copies for nieces and nephews. Tango presents single-sex couples in a matter-of-fact, loving way that we appreciated.  For all children, like ours, who already have a single-sex couple among the people they love, and for the rest of America's children, who will soon, whether in school or among friends' families, meet a single-sex couple, this book goes a long way to assuring them that single-sex couples are also natural and loving.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I saw this for sale after Christmas and HAD to get it because I love James Taylor so much!  It is great.  I just figured that it would be folk-y sounding, like a lot of his stuff is, but it has more of a jazz base to it.  JT can't mess anything up - it is awesome.  My little girl and I listened to it a few times after Christmas and she loved it.  I can't wait for next holiday season to roll around so that we can put it into rotation with our Christmas CD collection.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I have always loved Celtic music and the Irish folk tunes for their magically charming sounds, but these women raise the Celtic genre to a new level. The four vocalists' voices are all beautiful and incomparable - distinct. &Oacute;rla has a wonderfully soft and soothing voice as can be heard in scores like Siuil A Run, one of my favorites; M&eacute;av has what I would call a crystal clear voice (She Moved Thru' the Fair); Lisa is equally talented and sings most of my favorites; Chloë has a remarkable voice which is made even more so when considering her young age. And of course, we can't ignore M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad, the fiddle champion, who always steals the show. Their music has an alleviating effect and I often listen to them when I want to relax.

1932100660|5.0|This is probably the best-documented book on health care I have ever read.  This is not a \\"diet program\\" book.  The author has nothing to sell (no pills, no supplements, no videos, no special diet books -- nothing!!!).  He just wants you and I to know what he has observed over nearly 40 years (much in research labs, more in the \\"field\\" to include the nation of China).  For those with cancer (like me, for example), you will gets the clearest explanation of this disease I have found in 2 1/2 years of searching for answers in my bout with melanoma and other skin cancers.

B000002KHH|5.0|Its a god-dam classic.  Everything has been said already about this band.  War Pigs, one hell of a song and then kicks off to Paranoid, the short but catchy tune.  Planet Caravan is a peaceful but still great song.  Iron Man(you all know that one) Electric Funeral, dark and great for this, Hand of Doom - politcal like War Pigs and I'm loving the bass line of course.  Rat Salad, instrumental with awesome drumming and guitaring of course.  Fairies Wear Boots, the finisher and a perfect finisher indeed. Percussion at its peak on this song.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I can't compare this to the other DT live releases, as this was the first one I recieved (I got this on Christmas BTW), but I *can* tell you that this DVD is awesome and no DT fan should be without it. I couldn't ask for a better Dream Theater DVD: A great setlist (although I would have liked to hear more songs from the Scenes From A Memory album), crystal clear sound and production, and a second DVD that talks about the history of Dream Theater up until '05.<br /><br />In the concert DVD, Dream Theater start off with The Root of All Evil from their latest album. This one of the best songs off Octavarium in my opinion. Then we go into the good-if-too-poppy I Walk Beside You. Then they play Another Won - a song that they never released on an album and is over 20 years old. A very good song too, and it was awesome of DT to keep the song on the DVD, because I'm sure we're all hungry for some new Dream Theater material. Then they play Afterlife off their debut, back when Charlie Domninici was vocalist. Honestly, I haven't heard the studio version (I can't find the CD anywhere!), but this is a great song, and it just makes me want to find the album more. Then James finally talks with the audience, thanking them for coming out. Then he says \\"Here's a song from Images and What?!?!\\" and the audience replies \\"Words!\\" Then they play Under A Glass Moon (best John Petrucci guitar solo ever), and perfectly as well. Then they play Innocence Faded from the Awake album, and Raise the Knife from the Falling Into Infinity sessions, though it never made it to the album. Another nice thought of recording a song that DT fans haven't heard before. If you ask me, they should have left this on the FII album, because it's a great song, and FII is personally my least favorite DT album. Then they play The Spirit Carries On, which, while not as good as the studio version (I personally expected a bunch of gospel singers to come out and sing like on the SFAM album), is great live.<br /><br />Then an orchestra - known as the Octavarium Orchestra - plays the intro to 6 Degrees of inner Turbulence. After that, Dream Theater comes back on and plays the ENTIRE 42-minute 8-song epic Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence complete with the orchestra! This is without a doubt in my mind the highlight of the DVD. Then they play Vacant from the Train of Thought album, which is also very good (very underrated album BTW). Then we're brought back to Octavarium with The Answer Lies Within, Sacrificed Sons, and the incredible title track - one of their best songs yet no doubt. For the concert closer, they play Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper, currently my favorite song from the Images And Words album. Combined with the orchestra, you really couldn't ask for a better album closer.<br /><br />At the beginning of each song, the 3 jumbo-trons behind the band show what year and album the song is from. They also serve to show the people in the nosebleed seats the bands' bright and shining faces!<br /><br />The 2nd DVD is a flawless decummentary, going all the way back to when they first became a band, even the singer they had long before James Labire or even Charlie Dominici (can't think of the original singer's name at the moment, but he sounded a LOT like Queensryche's Geoff Tate and Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson). The 5 of them talk about the struggles they faced as a band (namely the lineup changes they went through and the new owners of their record company who didn't care about them), their rise to fame, and their thoughts on each album. During this documentary, they show small clips of their music videos and live performances anywhere from 1 to 20 years ago. There are also some quick interviews with fans. While some of them are mindless drones and posers who just want to be in front of the camera, others actually take the time to speak their thoughts on the band. To make it even better, we have 3 more live performances: Another Day (August 26, 1993), The Great Debate (July 4, 2002), and Honor Thy Father (August 12, 2005).<br /><br />Overall, my expectations were met in just about every direction. However, I think it would have been better if they played 1 or 2 more songs from the Scenes From A Memory album, but maybe I'm a little biased since that *is* my favorite DT recording. Still, there are other DT live DVDs/albums out there, but for now, this one will certainly do.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Dream Theater, you MUST buy this right now.

B000GY729M|5.0|an epic, adventurous and entirely successful work that dramatically proves the rationale for all the buzz. These guys are electrifying in their delivery of these songs. They boldy explore the great thematic album that takes you on a journey. It's not enough to simply write and perform great songs. The Killers do that and much, much more. They effectively craft a lush, stimulating and vast realm of sound and vision that leaves you satisfied on one hand, and also craving more and more. Brilliant!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|A typical comment about this album: \\"it's just not the same as their old stuff.\\"  Well, this is a correct statement--not much of anything is the same as it was in the late 80's early 90's.  I am definitely a fan of the newer Chili Peppers' sound, but I must say that this album blends their old and new styles together.  Their sound has matured.  Obviously (as stated by the Grammy wins and insane success on billboard charts and radio stations nation/world-wide), there are people out there that dig this album and appreciate their contribution of actual music to society.  The Chili Peppers are one of the only bands remaining today that actually contributes traditional elements of rock and roll (moving bass lines, various drum styles, and incorporation of jazz and blues)to their unique style.  Don't think so? Take a listen to \\"Readymade\\" or \\"Hey\\" (or actually listen to the WHOLE album).  There are so many songs to listen to on this album, I haven't gotten tired of it since I purchased it this past Spring.  If you want to complain about an album, complain about a band who releases a CD with 10 tracks on it, 5 of which are the only ones you listen to.  I'll support a previous argument: if you don't like this album, you probably haven't listened to the whole thing.  And if you have listened to it and STILL don't like it....that's just too bad for you  because you're missing out on a classic.

B00005JPFQ|2.0|After nearly losing his father Barton Blaze (Brian Cullen) to a bout of cancer, young Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) sold his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to help erradicate it. However, Johnny's happy times came to an end when Barton was fatally injured during a motorcycle stunt show. To make matters worse, Johnny had to split from his girlfriend Roxanne (Raquel Alessi). Flash forward a few years later to an older Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage), who is an international stuntman sensation. His girlfriend (Eva Mendes) returns to his life, now a news reporter, as well as Mephistopheles, who offers to release Johnny's soul if Johnny becomes the fabled, fiery Ghost Rider, a supernatural agent of vengeance and justice. Mephistopheles charges Johnny with defeating the despicable Blackheart (Wes Bentley), Mephistopheles's nemesis and son, who plans to displace his father and create a new hell even more terrible than the old one. <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" marks the return to comic book movies for director Mark Steven Johsnon, who helmed 2003's \\"Daredevil\\". Johnson had a hit with that film, which made Colin Farrell a must-watch star of that year, while sadly disrespecting Ben Affleck's thespian skills. Still, the director used the comic books as inspiration to the film and packed it with tight martial arts action that I dare anyone to dismiss. <br /> <br />\\"Rider\\" is a step back, however. It wants to be this cheesy fun action ride a la \\"Blade\\" II that has Nicolas Cage having the time of his life (it doesn't even hurt that, in real life, Cage is a comic book buff). Okay, pathos would be good, considering that this IS a movie based on a comic book. But Johnson seems to compromise things with a minimally developed love story, superhero movie cliches, a villain that would make \\"Super Mario Bros.\\" villain Bowser look like the Green Goblin, and overwhelming religious tones (I'm a firm believer in God, don't get me wrong, but more on this later). It's a good movie, nevertheless, but not enjoyable enough to be a guilty pleasure or another worthy superhero movie to join the ranks of Spider-Man or Superman Returns. <br /> <br />The movie starts out comfortably enough. Johnson gets the story going by detailing the past of how Johnny Blaze became the Ghost Rider, even if it doesn't stress the father-son relationship. As the movie kicks in to the present time, it really kicks in as Cage jumps a long line of cars to the tune of Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Crazy Train\\". Call me crazy, but it had me in goosebumps. It didn't hurt that supporting player Donal Logue offers some comic relief as Johnny's teammate and friend Mack. In scenes like this, Johnson feels comfortable enough to let these scenes play out, and it's pretty good. <br /> <br />What sets this tone off balance is how dead serious the movie becomes later. Save for a couple humorous lines, Johnson once again relies on a heavy amount of religious undertones. While I'm not atheist, and did not read any \\"Ghost Rider\\" comic books, I felt that the scenes at the cemetary with Sam Elliott's caretaker character threw the movie's flamboyant fun factor off balance and eventually becoming a morose guilt trip than an adrenaline-fueled guilty pleasure. Of course, comic book movies can have pathos, but at least they should be, I don't know, fun. <br /> <br />Then there is the cliches of this genre: hero with a chip on his shoulder, a love interest that needs to be rescued (this isn't something Johnson did in \\"Daredevil\\" when he had Jennifer Garner stand firm alongside - and often outact - Ben Affleck), a soundtrack that sledgehammers the fact to audiences that this is a movie about Hell (along with heavy metal guitar riffs), and an over-the-top villain (haven't we learned anything after Alfred Molina's jokey, but poignant line readings as Dr. Octopus in \\"Spider-Man 2\\"?). Johnson does have fun with a few of these cliches, but the other parts are stale and don't have much effect on audiences. <br /> <br />At least we've got Nic Cage, right? A fan of Ghost Rider in real life, the actor relishes the universe he is in. While at times he delivers his lines in a monotone voice, and has some awfully cheesy facial expressions (watch as he holds a gun before battling Blackheart), Cage walks the fine line between a good time and seriousness. It's when he turns into the Ghost Rider that he delivers the worst puns since \\"Batman & Robin\\". Nevertheless, it's not as bad as people say. <br /> <br />I just wished the rest of the cast was on the same page. Curiously, Johnson has Eva Mendes dressed very sexy with her chest almost exposed, meaning that despite an awful performance, she'll at least turn a few heads with her sexy body. The truth of the matter is Mendes is NOT Jessica Simpson. Co-starring in some riotously funny comedies (\\"All About the Benjamins\\", \\"Hitch\\", and \\"Stuck on You\\"), Mendes should put away cynical doubts that she'll be wasted in a cast lead by powerhouse Cage, and deliver the same charming performance that she always does. Sadly, her performance here is the opposite. It's not anywhere near Katie Holmes cringe-worthy cuteness in \\"Batman Begins\\", but the potential is not taken advantage of. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast is underused, especially Wes Bentley, who is about as threatening as a Nintendo baddie instead of the spawn of Satan. And other respectable talent like Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott look like they don't know where they are. <br /> <br />Rider is not what I call a bad film. But it seems like Johnson is on auto-pilot here, relying on large amounts of CGI to mask up the wafer-thin plot and performances. At least in \\"The Punisher\\" they didn't use special effects at all, even if the movie was a bit of a drag. When Nicolas Cage delivers the single good performance, and Eva Mendes and \\"flat performance\\" are in one sentence, you know something is wrong. What could've been a grand-ol' time at the movies becomes a a guilt trip. Let's hope all involve come out of this with their respectable dignities.

0142001104|4.0|An excellent read that suggests to look inside of one's self to find way to make ordinary life more functional. The book was written by a husband and wife team. Both Zanders give suggestions about taking every day circumstances and making them meaningful. His teaching of music provides a method to move his students to find their potential. I loved her conversation with gas station workers on a Sunday morning that turned a dead conversation into a lively conversation.I found the book helpful and stimulating.
B000M341QO|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat. Powerful movie, real life, so takes a little getting used to \\"being with the boys\\". I can't image that DiCaprio, Nicholson and Damon are not up for awards. The film and the director are..certainly earned it, as well as Mark Wahlberg.<br /><br />All I can say is WOW..hope the \\"baby\\" has a good life.
B000BB1MIC|2.0|Season 5 of Gilmore Girls was disappointing. Mostly, because I really loathed the direction the writers took with Rory, the boring Luke/Lorelai pairing and Ritchie Rich, um, er.. Logan character. The only bright points in this season was the development of Lane, the ending of the relationship between Paris and that creepy professor, and the dragonfly inn.<br /><br />First my peeves: I found Rory incredibly obnoxious this season. She started off as such a wholesome, nice girl, but has slowly become an obnoxious rich brat. Her treatment of her Grandmother, her insensitivity to Dean, and the the way she behaves  is just rude and callous. I really expected more from her. Plus, what I like about this series is the small town atmosphere. The richer than God friends Rory has been hanging out with make me feel like I'm watching Dynasty.<br /><br />Lorelai has regressed to about 13. Since when does Lorealai need protection by her daughter? The Luke/Lorelai pairing bored me. I just don't see any chemistry there. Luke's treatment of Dean was obnoxious. I found it difficult to believe that Lorelai and Rory wouldn't have some issue with that. Okay, so they give their own mother the cold shoulder for playing matchmaker and don't get annoyed with Luke for trying to engineer Rory's relationship....Okay.<br /><br />The girls were hypocritical and irritating this season. I'm hoping season 6 is better. Thank god this was just a rental.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|First off, great album. Now to business, I'm tired of many half-hearted music fans saying that Korn has fallen off it's game and doesn't make \\"good\\" music anymore. \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is one of their best cd's to date and has a handful of great hits.     I've been a Korn fan since the mid 90's and although their style and sound has changed, they haven't changed for the worst. People need to realize that artist have to grow and expand out past what they did on their freshman and sophmore cd's. Korn has done this flawlessly. Sorry if the so-called \\"banger Korn fans\\" don't like the hip-hop direction the band is going in but for those that just love great music then this is a must have album. \\"Coming Undone\\" is by far the best rock song to be released in the entire industry for at least a couple years.     This cd is a much needed fresh breath of air in an industry enveloped by bitchy emo bands and whiny [..]rockers. It's nice to hear songs that consists of more than just three cords, trust me, I can't be the only one who hates what people call \\"Rock or Metal\\" nowadays.     Anyway buy this album and you won't be disappointed and while you're at it pick up the others. Keep up the great work guys and I hope to see a new cd drop soon.
B00003CXDD|4.0|Excellent fantasy story. Very good characters and acting skills. Film location perfect for the story and time frame.
B000CCBCAS|5.0|No doubt others on Amazon have ably told you what this Best Picture-nominated movie is about, so let me only pause to add that my favorite part of this style-heavy mid-90's Brit-com (the one that made Hugh Grant and his boyishly handsome \\"Oh, shucks\\" grin a star) is when Carrie,  Andie MacDowell's American-born character, \\"confronts\\" Hugh Grants' self-effacing Charles, with how extensive and well-remembered the rank and file of her sexual body count happens to be. The infatuated if commitment-phobic Charles stands in wide-eyed shock, even as he tries to handle what he is hearing with good-natured cheer, but just watching Charles as he forces his mouth not to fall open makes for an endearingly hilarious moment. (Hey, guys, if you didn't wanna know, why'd you ask? Right, girls?) There's also a show-stealing bit wherein Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean, himself, plays a nervously virginal vicar fumblingly presiding at one of the promised \\"four weddings\\" of the film. Really there are too many excellent performances here among British veterans of stage and screen---Simon Callow, Kristin Scott Thomas, Mike Newell, everyone it sometimes seems except a conspicuously absent Helena Bonham Carter---for this to be anything but a delight to own and watch again and again. Sure, many out there might dismiss Four Weddings and a Funeral as a \\"mere\\" chick flick, but I like it, and it's one of the more endearing movies to come out of Britain in many moons.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|So on the heels of the Ultimate Avengers movies, come Invincible Iron Man, the third in a string of animated Marvel straight-to-dvd movies being released by Lions Gate.  Like I said before in my Avenger reviews, Iron Man was my favorite character, so how could I not check this one out and see how I liked Tony Stark flying solo. <br /> <br />Well, my reaction was a little mixed.  Tony has a great personality and sense of humor about him, so I would never say he's a boring character.  However, it seemed like they couldn't quite fill in the rest of the movie around him.  Jim Rhodes appears, but not as War Machine.  The love interest is forgettable.   <br /> <br />The thing I found surprising is this is an origin story.  I figured this would take place after the events of UA 1 & 2, but instead takes place before.  Why not make this movie for fans who need no introduction, when the live action Iron Man movie is getting released next year which is sure to have yet another origin story.  It's seems like a little overkill.  I don't know if the Mandarin, Iron Man's archnemesis, will appear in the live action version or not, but he does in this installment. <br /> <br />Overall, not bad.  A decent attempt, but hopefully Doctor Strange will blow it away come August when that's released to DVD.  It is yet another origin story, but the intro for it looks really promising.
B00005JPKC|5.0|I liked this movie a lot, it is extremely historically accurate.  I don't have a clue why there is so much buzz about the movie showing the \\"humanity\\" of the Japanese.  In my opinion this truthful account of the battle shows plenty about the deranged brutality of Japanese culture during this period, and it's wonderful that they lost the war and a shame that so many Americans had to die in order to accomplish that objective.  Of course the Japanese were humans and had families and certain common emotions, and I suppose viewers can reach whatever conclusions they wish from that obvious fact, even if it means ignoring all the other facts surrounding the battle and the war.  But I'm giving a good rating for historical accuracy, not for opinions generated by the movie.
0446528056|5.0|Made me laugh, cry, throw pillows, and read when I should be doing other things - like sleeping, working, and writing my own novel! Yet, moments spent wrapped in the comfy embrace of Nicholas' books are worth the distraction. In \\"Dear John\\", Nicholas introduces us to realistic characters who share the same struggles we deal with every day - distance from loved ones, lack of understanding of basic truths, desire for things we can't have... and experiencing first love. Yet characters John and Savannah present these concepts in such a heartwrenching, honest and emotional way that we can't help but feel anything other than sympathy, remorse, desire, affection, and pain for them as we reminisce our own First Love story... <br /> <br />Two trembling thumbs-up (still a little teary-eyed!)
B000KCHZK6|5.0|For a third album, the first of all her own originally written tunes, it's a surprisingly thoughtful, funny mix of genres, politics, and life with all its ups and downs. After three listens, the album seems to grow in poignancy  in some parts, humor in others for me. A personal like are \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" and \\"My Dear Country\\" (a little bit of a surprise). Overall, I love this album. This and \\"Come Away with Me\\" still remain my favorites, from her, but that's not a put down of her second, which remains a close second. Looking forward to more work from Norah in the future.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD brings back memories and helps to make new ones.  The sound quality is quite better than the original album.
B00005JPE7|5.0|Let's face it, the first \\"Rocky\\" movie was the best one. I think the others are good too, but fans of the series have waited for this movie. I thought the story and acting were great, and the part where he tells Pauly in the meat locker that \\"sometimes there's this beast in me\\" is just bone-chilling, but at the same time sad. The movie really touches your heart. Great job Sly !

B00005JPFQ|4.0|Be warned: SPOILERS.<br /><br />I liked GHOST RIDER, I liked it a lot. And it's not because the acting was that great or the storyline that gripping. No, it was because Ghost Rider just looked so very damned cool on cinema (yes, I'm very shallow). Every time that flaming skull was on screen was yet another moment that made up for certain inadequacies which had held down the film. Admittedly, these comments are colored by my life-long addiction to comic books and superheroes. Although I'm not a big fan of Ghost Rider, I'm certainly familiar with his mythos and have read several of his issues. To me, the only change worth noting in the transition from comics to screen is that, now, Johnny Blaze guzzles jellybeans in a Martini glass and relaxes to Karen Carpenter tunes (I sense the Nic Cage influence at work here). Else, Johnny is the same tortured creature who, by day, is human and, by night, is a Spirit of Vengeance.<br /><br />The plot: When 17-year-old Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) discovers his father has developed cancer, he signs a pact in blood with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda, EASY RIDER) to save his dad. In return, the devil gets Johnny's soul. Many years later, Johnny (now played by Nicolas Cage, sporting an ungainly hairpiece) has followed in his father's footsteps and has become a motorcycle stunt rider in the Evel Kneivel mold. Nicknamed \\"Mr. Invincible\\" and hailed as a death defying superstar, Johnny prefaces every show with a soft utterance of his mantra \\"You can't live in fear\\" and has sought ever more dangerous stunts to dispel his suspicions that his success isn't due to his own skills but rather to the protective ministrations of Mephistopheles. He's about to find out.<br /><br />When Mephistopheles's son, the pigment-challenged, life force-sucking Blackheart (Wes Bentley), seeks to take over the family business - and just as Johnny becomes reacquainted with lost love Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes, ay caliente!) - Mephistopheles finally calls in his debt. Thus, Johnny unwillingly becomes the Ghost Rider, the Devil's emissary and bounty hunter. At night and in the presence of evil, Johnny goes thru a painful transformation as his body is supernaturally set on fire. In this guise, he is impervious to bullets and can take a serious amount of abuse. He can summon hellfire and can avail himself of the Penance Stare, an ability which allows him to mete out punishment to evildoers. And he has that smokin' hog...<br /><br />Mephistopheles contracts the Rider to take out Blackheart. But, naturally, it won't be easy. Blackheart has gathered into his own circle the Hidden (aka the Nephilim), three fallen angels with the elemental powers of air, water, and earth. And Blackheart also has a plan. He aims to dig up the lost contract stolen by another Ghost Rider one hundred fifty years ago, a contract boasting the names of souls so evil that that particular Rider rebelled against the Devil and skedaddled. Possessing this contract would presumably give Blackheart the edge over his father.<br /><br />Now, special effects-wise, I have absolutely no complaints. It's very hard to improve on the look of the Ghost Rider. Really, what's cooler than a burning skull? In terms of the Rider's physical manifestation, the movie, wisely, stuck with what's worked in the Marvel Universe. All the Rider's toys look awesome: the Hellcycle, his hellfire, and his flame-wracked chain. The Hidden, while turning out to be nothing but supernatural sissies after all, however, look very cool. And, when the Rider and the caretaker go for that one final ride together near the end, riding to \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky,\\" well, the theater audience erupted in appreciative applause.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage has declared himself a longtime fan of Ghost Rider (he even has a tattoo of the Rider), and he brings to the film a sincerity and a sense of fun, as well as his patented idiosyncratic touches. In his hands, Johnny Blaze is definitely a more intriguing character, if more off the wall. Eva Mendes, beautiful girl, but her performance is somewhat lackluster here. What's missing, I think, is that fire and sexy spunk she displayed in movies such as HITCH and OUT OF TIME. Her best scene in this film may have been when she is stood up by Johnny in a restaurant date and she then half-jokingly asks the waiter if he thinks she's pretty (that waiter's a knucklehead, but I did chuckle at his response). Peter Fonda mines nostalgia for all its worth from his iconic Captain America role in EASY RIDER as he gets back in a motorcycle flick, though he doesn't ride a bike. I never was quite sure if I ended up liking his performance as Mephistopheles or not. Meanwhile, Sam Elliott continues to be his ol' reliable self. He even gets a bit of a chance to relive his  more virile cowboy days.<br /><br />Now an assortment of beefs. My personal opinion is that neither Matt Long (young Johnny) nor Raquel Alessi (young Roxanne) adequately bear a resemblance to their older counterparts. Not a big deal, but it did throw me off the viewing mood for a nano-second. The fact that the three elemental antagonists succumbed too easily to Ghost Rider bugged me somewhat. The earth elemental, in particular, had me irked with the discarding of his own element in his attack on the Rider. And when a comic book is translated into cinema, surely we can dispense with the stilted, hokey dialogue. As it is, I had to endure unabashed corn such as \\"My name is Legion - for we are many\\" and \\"I'm the only one that walk in both worlds - I'm Ghost Rider.\\" Pleeease.<br /><br />But, even with my gripes, I still find myself overwhelmingly in favor of GHOST RIDER. He's such a viscerally compelling figure, and I can never have enough of his head just, poof, combusting. The CG is so well done. Of course, there are a few dead spots here and there in this flick (some in the opening sequences, some in the scenes with Cage and Elliott), but, mostly, the viewer's attention is engaged. And, certainly, whenever the Rider is on camera, the movie takes on a whole new dimension of appeal. I like the fact that the Ghost Rider seems to be more of a raging force of nature, more his own entity, rather than a controlled extension of Johnny Blaze, although, undoubtedly, he exercises somewhat of an influence. Another factor in this movie's favor is its sense of humor, some of which originates from Nicolas Cage himself and his quirkiness. I've read that Nicolas Cage has already provincially agreed to a sequel. I absolutely believe this inaugural GHOST RIDER will demand sequels.racter, if more off the wall.

B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run is a superb movie. It's pretty much one of those movies you MUST see in your lifetime. If you are a fan of the Simpsons, you will have noticed that there was even a reference to Run Lola Run in an episode with Lisa and her robot, Linguo. It's simply an amazing movie that everyone knows about. there are many cool aspects to the movie: first, franka potente has awesome hair and is a really good actress, very convincing. second, the movie is made up of 3 different scenarios (all of which are really intense and enthralling, an \\"edge of your seat\\" movie) and it's rare to see a movie like that, especially an american movie. third, the characters are all pretty well developed and although most of it is her running (awesome that a movie title actually reflects what's going to happen in the movie for once), whenever faced with a character, you are really drawn deeper into their personality. dont be wary of the subtitles. movies with subtitles are easy to get into. you dont even notice you're reading them after the first 10 minutes. subtitles are actually pretty great because they allow you to hear the movie how it should be heard, but still be able to understand it. they are MUCH better than voice-overs. in a nutshell, SEE THIS MOVIE!

0553804367|4.0|Hawking does a great job of breaking down complex concepts for someone with no science background.

B000002U9E|5.0|To me, Kate Bush's Hounds of Love album exemplifies what 80s music was truly meant to be.  Big sound, sweeping synthesizers, bold yet ethereal voice, powerful lyrics.  On vacation last summer in Cape Cod, I borrowed the album from the local library there (my family and friends had brought along a selection of music CDs that was too mellow for my mood one day).  Because our location was a little isolated, and everyone else had gone out fishing or shopping, I put this album on and blasted it.  I was totally transported by Bush's singing and the wave of sound.  I hit repeat 2 or 3 times and basked in the glory of this ultimate aural experience.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|I have no problems with the release of this expanded edition, since the original dualdisc wouldn't play in my car cd player, and I have worked in recording studios and think that mp3s decrease the sound of the original mix.  <br /> <br />The album itself is excellent.  Innovative is the word that comes to mind.  The acoustic thing has been done, but the use of the horns and organ, mixed with the rousing reworkings of the material, make this album a joy to listen too.  It is different from what most artists are doing today.  Instead of doing the whole bluegrass thing, which has been done a lot recently, Springsteen mixes the style of each track, incorperating them into \\"gutter music.\\"  The rawness of the takes create a ferocity that professional producers cannot achieve with countless takes and overdubs.
B000002GB9|4.0|1977 - tommy shaw is like turning a light on in a dark room...  before him styx was missing some depth in their vocal range & harmonies not to mention their guitar line-up helping james young out.  this epic album is pure genius but is heavily flawed in one area as are many albums from the 60s-70s --- THE DRUMMING SUCKS...  I just can't stand john panozzo's drumming from his muted acoustics to his dull patterns & poor timing...  otherwise, this album is ahead of it's time.  If the drums were better the album would be 5 stars...  I think deyoung's keyboard's are phenominal but the drums aren't there to back them up.  Especially in fooling yourself... The grand illusion opens the album showing the new band's vocal range & guitar stylings.  You can hear the improved harmonies & shaw's flawless guitar riffs.  I also think that shaw & young do a good job of rotating guitar duties.  Chuck's bass part's are muted & unaggressive per usual but that's okay because the vocals & keys make up for it.  The album is almost conceptual as it's reviewed at the end.  I love it.  It's in my cd player all the time...
1579125549|5.0|I am a little over 300 problems in and just starting the Mate in 2's, but I have learned more from this book, because of the difficult positions that it shows.

There were times where I wanted to discard the book, and proclaim it too difficult, but after some really hard work, you will begin to see the problems for what they are:  A challenge.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|This cd is pure Gwen. There are alot of different styles blended with pop, the lyrics are interesting and unique, and the delivery is well done. The production on this album was good, all the producers worked really well with Gwen's style, especially the hip hop ones. Suprisingly, they provided the best songs on here. Vocally, Gwen delivers withoput fail, she even yodels which is a very unusual element for an album. However, what I didn't like was her album seemed to be divided into 2 parts. The hip hop side and the pop/rock one. The songs were extremely set in one genre or the other, instead of the middle area, that we saw last album. So it kind of made the cd hard to vibe with b/c it was so far one way or the other. Also, I feel like the cd is incomplete. I think the album should have had a few more songs to it, to enrich it. Overall, I think if you like Stefani, you will like the cd. Listen For: Sweet Escape, Orange County, Now That You've Got It
0743289412|4.0|Following King's overblown return to his gory roots in Cell, the bestselling author goes Harlequin novel on us with this this minimally sanguinary tearjerker set in rural Maine. Much like `Bag of Bones' before it, this novel deals with the aftermath of death and  the end of a career. Lisey is the widow of a (no kidding) popular and distinguished novelist, Scott Landon, and she can't cope with his untimely death, so she revisits in memory the times they had adventure like the time she saved him from an deranged killer . The best thing about this ok novel is the protagonist--  Lisey is not the brightest kitten on the planet, and she's kind of annoying, which makes her all the more real. What he also gives us here is a powerful feminist tome of gals supporting each other in grief and danger.
B000H305U0|4.0|This album was good but I like the first one better. This one has lots of different sounds, like JT was not sure where he was going with it. Some styles work better for him then others. The techno pop thing he did with \\"Sexyback\\", to me just is not for him. He should stick to the more tradtional JT sound like in \\"My Love\\", thats a classic return to who he was when he first came out. The other songs on the album follow that same pattern. Overall, his lyrics are nice and his delivery is great, he just needs to center his style more. Hot Tracks: My Love, Losing My Way, Chop Me Up

B00005JPC7|5.0|Fine film-maker Marc Forster (Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland) has swept me off my feet again in 'Stranger Than Fiction'. Emma Thompson plays a novelist who is attempting to finish a novel, but she continues to have problems with the ending. Enter Will Ferrell. He starts to hear a voice when he is brushing his teeth. It is the writers' voice he hears. He doesn't know where the voice is coming from, but he is determined to find out. <br /> <br />Marc Forster, who directed Johnny Depp to an Oscar nomination in 'Finding Neverland', clearly works well with actors. Thompson, Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal (excellent as Ferrell's girlfriend), Dustin Hoffman (Ferrell' mentor), and Queen Lativah all give great performances (even Tom Hulce and Linda Hunt have effective cameos). <br /> <br />I was reading some of the negative reactions to this film. Forget that Forster directed the Oscar nominated 'Finding Neverland'. Forget that Forster directed the Oscar-winning 'Monster's Ball'. 'Stranger than Fiction is truly one of the best films of 2006. Maybe those viewers need to watch this marvelous film a second time. The script, and Ferrell should have been nominated for Oscars. <br /> <br />Those of you who are familiar with Ferrell's work knows he tends to chew the scenery most of the time. But this is not Ferrell who you're used to. But after watching 'Stranger Than Fiction', I really believed in his 'ficticious' character. It's a sad but comical performance. <br /> <br />Remember how Jim Carrey was ignored by the Academy for his performance in 'The Truman Show' (even though he was nominated for a Golden Globe), Ferrell was also nominated for a Golden Globe, and ignored. <br /> <br />For those who didn't like STF, you may want to give it a second chance and allow it to grow on you. It sports one of the best scripts in some time (certainly not since 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' have we seen it's like - hey, didn't 'Eternal' win for best screenplay). <br /> <br />Thismovie, unlike most of today's garbage - I hate to sound harsh, but it's true - will challenge you. It will give you something to think about at the office the next day. <br /> <br />Please don't make 'Saw VIII' your next movie of choice. Please give this one a chance instead. You might like it.

6305907145|4.0|This is not a bad film. My only issue with it is that it \\"masquerades\\", so to speak, as Jane Austen's Mansfield Park. The only similarities between this movie and the novel of the same name are the names of the characters, their basic relationships with each other, and the skeleton of the plot. Other than that, it could have been a different story. Fanny-in-the-movie is not the same person as Fanny-in-the-book - in this movie she's outgoing, rather obstinate, and strong willed. This isn't to say that this movie isn't enjoyable - I actually really enjoyed it once I made up my mind not to watch it as Mansfield Park, but as an unconnected story. I just wish they had called it something else, which I know is a silly sentiment but even so. :P   One thing I will say in favor of this film as an adaptation of Mansfield Park: it contains the most perfect Edmund Bertram that I have ever encountered. Other than that, don't try to reconcile this film with the book - it will just frustrate and annoy you.
B00080ZG10|3.0|The Howard Hughes story is huge - he inherrited wealth as a teen, while the world thought he was blowing it, he drove innovation in film and aviation.  Along the way his personal eccentricities and dalliances with Hollywood stars were the stuff of legend - and gossip pages. <br /> <br />Despite almost 3 hours of footage, the Aviator fails to capture the bigness of Howard Hughes.  One is left with only a partial story of one of the century's giants - a glimpse of a playboy with vision.  Unfortunately Howard Hughes was so much more.  Perhaps 3 hours was too long for shortened version, and too long for a mini-series that wouldn't sell.  Either way, the reader is simultaneously left bored and wanting more. <br /> <br />Perhaps the acting is what saved the movie?  Even those who don't like Dicaprio can agree he lost himself in the role.  Balwin plays a role easy to him - a villian you can quickly hate.  Even Alan Alda manages to shed Hawkeye for the role. <br /> <br />In summary, it just isn't worth the 3 hours when there's so many other good movies out there.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Here we go again. In the history of film making, there are few directors that have been praised as much as Martin Scoresese. By that same token, it's kind of strange to see a man make so many classic movies like \\"Taxi Driver,\\" \\"Goodfellas,\\" and \\"Raging Bull\\" never win an Academy Award of any kind. I thought for sure \\"The Aviator\\" would be the movie where Scoresese would finally get awarded the Oscar he deserved, yet the A.M.P.S.A. felt differently, and awarded the Oscar to Clint Eastwood and his boxing movie \\"Million Dollar Baby.\\" Now Scoresese has brought us \\"The Departed,\\" to prove to us once again why he's one of the few directors to get his name above the title of the movies he directs. \\"The Departed\\" revolves around a crime lord by the name of Frank Costello. Costello is a smooth talking, chain smoking, terrifying villain. One of the worst I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />He kills without hesitation, tortures without batting an eye, and actually finds humor in his methods of madness (after killina woman in cold blood he jokes \\"Huh?  She fell funny\\"). In seducing a young boy to join his gang, Costello says \\"When I was your age, they would say you could either become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?\\" The boy he gives this scary bit of advice is named Colin Sullivan, who grows up to become one of the more important cops in the police department, but is really a mole for Costello, who he shares confidential information with. On the other end of the spectrum is Billy Costigan, who was training to be a cop, but flunked out of the academy. However, the police department feels he can still be of use to them, so they convince him to fake a crime, get thrown in prison, and be released a year later to become a spy on Costello for them.<br /><br />The plan works, and a year and a half later, Costigan is in Costello's gang, making deals and beating up store owners who are late on their payment. Soon though, Costello suspects that there is a \\"rat\\" in his gang, and calls Sullivan with an order to find the rat. Likewise, the police suspect that is an informant leaking Costello information about the police department as well, and Costigan is ordered to discover the identity of this person too. Both men share information with everyone in many different ways, but the most intriguing device they use is the cell phone. With calling, text messaging, and voice recordings, the cell phone becomes a story device quite unlike anything else in this movie. Cell phones are normally used as gimmicks in movies, normally being degraded to simple things like ringing while someone is trying to hide from the bad guy. In this movie, the cell phone becomes an essential part of the story telling.<br /><br />It's used in so many unique and interesting ways, that if you took it out I don't think you would have a movie anymore. At the very least, you wouldn't have one that is half as interesting as this one. But the cell phone is not the only thing that makes this movie good. What also makes the movie work are the excellent performances from all the principle actors. Jack Nicholson proves once again why he's a living legend on the screen, Matt Damon shows that he is a very underrated actor, and Leonardo DiCaprio steps up to the plate to reenforce the notion that he is the next Robert DeNiro. In fact, looking at the past three to five films DeCaprio has made including this one, I think it's safe to say that DeCaprio has come a long way from being the icon of many a teenage girls dream several years ago. It's Jack Nicholson who takes up most of the screen time though, and is fascinating to watch from beginning to end.<br /><br />Playing a character that is a perfect vision of what true evil is, I think Jack Nicholson will be up for another Oscar nomination come January (Editor's Note: I was wrong on this one). In fact, I think it's pretty safe to say that while this film won't win any major prize, I would confidentially expect this film to get a Best Picture nomination for sure. Sadly, it will not win for two reasons. The first reason is that this is a Martin Scoresese picture, and none of his movies have won Best Picture despite their quality. The second reason is that despite the quality of this film, \\"United 93\\" is still a better movie, and five months later people are still talking about it, and I do believe that \\"United 93\\" will win the top prize (Editor's Note: Wrong again). For it's subject matter if nothing else.<br /><br />Still, at the end of the day \\"The Departed\\" is still a great movie with great writing, acting, and tension. It's smart, it keeps you at the edge of your feet, and there are several moments where you don't know where the movie is going, and you will be shocked at where it does go sometimes. I must admit that the amount of foul language in this movie is a bit bothersome, but seeing as how the movie is about a crime syndicate, it's (sadly) unsurprising. If movies with the use of a ton of F words bothers you, then you should just not watch this movie at all. Also the movie is extremely violent, so keep that into consideration also. But if you can stomach this, then by all means enjoy \\"The Departed,\\" one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Rating: **** and a half starsajor prize, I would confidentially expect this film to get a Best Picture nomination for sure.

B000A6CLL0|1.0|*Posslble Spoilers here* <br />At the end of the previous season, some race decides to wipe out 7 million Earthlings for no apparent reason, and the Enterprise crew spent this entire season trying to find them.  It was partially but not fully resolved by the end of season 3, and they left us on another cliffhanger at the end.  For anyone who thought the Xindi storyline was stupid, this one is even worse.  This season was bad enough that even a strong season 4 couldn't save the show.  In season 3, Star Trek became a 3rd rate soap opera. <br /> <br />A Star Trek about the first human starship to go out and explore space should have been along the lines of the first TV show, and the opening video reflects this by showing early explorers, but then the show is actually about them fighting multiple interdimensional time traveling aliens while being guided by humans from the distant future.  Oddly enough the first starship is able to stand toe to toe against aliens who have had space travel for hundreds if not thousands of years.  It is as if the writer wanted to write a different type of show, and forced it on this show.
0670034711|3.0|I give this book three stars ONLY because of the last chapter.  I love love loved the first two - Italy and India - and if they had been the only two chapters, I would have given this book five stars.  I liked the first part of the last chapter - Indonesia - very much.  Her morning and afternoon schedules with Wayan and Ketut were so insightful and amazing.  Loved that.  I'm not a prude but the book seemed to take a nosedive when she went out with Armenia and met Felipe.  I liked Felipe and thought he sounded like a very romantic, kind, respectful man.  I have no problem with him.  However, she suddenly halted what she had come to Indonesia for in lieu of falling prey to persuasive wooing from a hot Brazilian.  I know she is human but she admits in the book that she didn't see Ketut nearly as much as she had been.  How sad.  I was disappointed by that. <br /> <br />But, allow me not to dwell on the negative.  I simply felt that the second half of the last chapter didn't honor the path and the progress of the first two and a half chapters.  Disappointing. <br /> <br />Her writing is wildly entertaining, though.  That she can take life in an ashram and make it fun and interesting to read is a feat.  My favorite chapter was her time in the ashram, following so intimately with her as she delved into herself.  That was a treat.  I loved the imagery, the discoveries, the journey that she took. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book.  It is worth a read.  I was completely in love until the last half of the last chapter.  But, even despite that, it was still an amazing journey.

Documentaries like this are shown FREE on channels like Discovery, sci-fi, Tlc, history, etc... (for the DVD part, I'd give 5 stars for music and Marketing).    I am all for POSITIVE messages, but the \\"incredible\\", \\"life changing\\" and \\"light bulb in the head\\" comments give people who did not purchase this material FALSE HOPE of what they can expect, after all it's not free.

B000006NPY|3.0|Smashing Pumpkins are doubtlessly a quality band, but with 'Adore' they let down their well established reputation. <br /> <br />The album kicks off on a decent note with the delicate but well rendered 'To Sheila' as well as the impressive 'Ava Adore' and 'Daphne Descends'. However the album seems to go into a tailspin at a relatively early stage. It then becomes strewn with bland space filling numbers like 'Pug' and 'Once Upon A Time' as well as the hideous, drum machine laden, mid-tempo 'Appels + Oranjes' <br /> <br />'Adore' shows flashes of staging a third act recuperation during 'Behold! The Night Mare' and the more intimate 'For Martha'. However it never really manages to regain any momentum and never delivers on the promise that the early tracks offered. 'Adore' was a disappointing effort all in all. The few decent tracks scattered around merit the 3 stars but here's hoping that the new material that the band plan to release will be of a higher order.

1881273156|5.0|The Five Love Languages is a book that I would recommend for everyone! Not only does it help you to understand why you do the things you do, it also helps you understand why your spouse, kids, parents, friends, etc. do the things they do. We each have a way of expressing our emotions, and each of us is very different. If you are a hugger and try to express love or friendship by hugging someone who HATES to be hugged, you have done damage instead of the intended good.<br /><br />Being able to recognize our \\"love language\\" and recognize it in others can have a great benefit to the way we treat others as well as how we react to the way others treat us!<br /><br />Don't just read it and use it as an excuse to say \\"well, that's just the way I am and you need to love me the way I want you to!\\". Use it to transform your relationships and allow you to treat others the way THEY wish to be treated and to recognize love when it is shown in a way that you may not understand.

That was only last year, and so I found Rammstein a bit late in the day.  I made up for it by buying all their available CDs within a week.  This is my favorite band, next to The Cure. The wonderful thing about listening to music with lyrics in a foreign language is it always seems fresh to your ear, no matter how many times you play it. Rammstein isn't for everyone, but just try sampling to one or two songs on any of their CDs on here.  You'll know if you are going to love them or not, and if you do love them... it'll be forever.
0307275639|2.0|I don't know exactly whether this is a true story or not, but I do not find it particularly well constructed. <br /> <br />I bought it at the airport because it was on the stand and promised some interesting interaction between a wise/funny old man and a younger one. <br /> <br />The book, as you may know, describes the slow decay of Morrie who is depicted as a courageous, full of wisdom dying-old-man young at heart. <br /> <br />I found that this book to be really powerful lacked some 150 pages to let us care and feel connected to Morrie when he is still healthy, and let us know why we really should care about him now. My belief is that we could have sympathized much more with the character.  <br /> <br />It pretty much ends up in a depressing story of disease and rot about a small insignificant little old man full of himself delivering with \\"infinite wisdom\\" to the rest of the living world aphorisms and banalities one can pick in discounted 2 dollars self-help books bins. <br /> <br />A few good moments seem to appear when the narrator touches upon his relationship with his sick brother. But as suggested along by the narrator himself, the book itself actually avoids the real issues... big bla bla bla that doesn't really get to the point. I hardly believe it was the intended effect. <br /> <br /> <br />Will appeal to those still looking for canned-easy-to-adopt answers in their life and feel that this 200 pages book was \\"great\\" lesson for them, the others will look for something a bit better.  <br /> <br />If Morrie was a real person, I am sure he was a great guy and that it doesn't really matter if this book is , in my opinion, not of the highest quality. <br />
B000LC3ICY|4.0|In my opinion it's the weakest Saw yet. I didn't like a few things: first, events slowed down noticeably towards the middle of film. There was a bit too much drama, not the good kind- soap opera kind. I expected this movie to be even sharper than the other two: more clever traps, more suspense. Secondly, the signature \\"shocking\\" ending of Saw series was not too shocking in Saw 3. Watching the other Saw movies I did not have a clue on what's gonna happen until the very end, but unfortunately I \\"saw through\\" (get it? get it? \\"saw through?\\" I'm priceless...) most of this movie. All in all though, this movie is still worth the \\"Saw\\" name. What I liked about it is the message it carries. Also some very yaky moments out there. You won't be disappointed.
0300108834|3.0|I was recommended this book on the basis that it offered a broader view of world history than was typically taught (Egypt to Greece to Rome to Dark Ages to French Revolution). Unfortunately, this is exactly the trajectory that this book takes. For a book that claims to be a little history of the world, India and China barely rate a mention. A more appropriate title is perhaps \\"A history of a little of the world\\". <br /> <br />In fairness, the book was written in the 1930s. The prose is still beautifully written and enjoyable to read. I just wish there was more \\"world\\" in it. <br /> <br />
B0001KL5DA|5.0|I have often heard people say that All in the Family could never be produced today. I think this is true, at least, for network television (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX). All in the Family captures a specific moment in both television and American history. Carroll O'Connor excellently renders the American bigot, Archie Bunker, and puts him up for scrutiny before a live audience. All in the Family was not entirely about political correctness and bigotry, but when you look back at the show, those social forces remain the reasons why it couldn't be produced today.    Six Feet Under, uncensored, would certainly have no chance of being broadcast either. The politically correct imperative of contemporary American culture would sue and complain it to be another \\"wardrobe malfunction.\\" The malfunction, however, is in the emotional and intellectual dishonesty of most TV shows today, of most mainstream culture today. I think almost all of television is a cartoon. I like Six Feet Under because it is not a does not turn its homosexual characters into the prancing man-boys of Will & Grace. The violence in Six Feet Under is well earned and integral to the drama and comedy of the series. The sex and human relationships in Six Feet Under are complicated and weird, which is completely normal. Mostly, it's refreshing to watch a show that cares about story and character instead of explosions, statutory sex objects, and impossibly melodramatic events.    If All in the Family reflects a political awakening, taught through comedy, then Six Feet Under reflects a response to political correctness. The bigotry that All in the Family responds to is as monolithic and misanthropic as the political correctness Six Feet Under is responding to. Bigotry and political correctness are merely two sides of the same dishonesty; they are rules and codes for human behavior and expression that do not work out in real life. Archie Bunker was certainly not a subtle guy, but his assumptions about people different fromhim were wrong (and funny). Now, when everything is subtle and on politically correct eggshells, people are no longer honest. That's what Six Feet Under is about to me: We need to relearn how to trust others enough to be honest, and I think Six Feet Under accurately argues that not all honesty is mean, and avoiding confrontation isn't always nice.    In the end, HBO does with Six Feet Under what the networks used to do: Respect the intelligence, maturity, and humanity of the audience.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|Confessions Tour is simply amazing, and it was one of the DVDs that i was waiting to be released immediately. Madonna's energy is incredible.She makes you wanna dance from the start with the classics Like a Virgin and I Feel Love. The performance continues with ethnic sounded \\"Isaac\\", amazing ballad from COAD album \\"Forbidden Love\\" and another Madonna classic \\"Live To Tell\\". \\"Sorry\\" ,\\"Let It Will Be\\"  and \\"I Love New York\\"from her latest album keeps the energy of the show at the highest point. Madonna's performance is really amazing because she dances and sings at the same time perfectly. You never feel tired or bored until the show ends because the rest is full of Madonna classics such as \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and a new version of \\"Music\\" named as \\"Music Inferno\\". She does the final of the tour with the superb hit \\"Hung Up\\" and the audience goes crazy during the performance of this song! The only song i find unnecessary is the \\"You Thrill Me\\" version of \\"Erotica\\". But i don't mean it's not a good performance. You've got to buy this dvd + cd to hear and see the highest point an artist can reach. This album simply rocks!
B00016POFE|4.0|I first heard Porcupine Tree during a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics show.  The DTS version fully exploits a 5.1 channel music system; it's better than stereo like stereo is better than mono.   <br />PT's music suggests strong influences from Yes and Rush, without being deriviatives of either.

What does need to say is that the quality of the DVD during the first twenty minutes is inexcusable.  The scene early on in the movie in which Leonardo DiCaprio talks with Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg looks as if it's a VHS copy of a VHS copy.  I don't know if this was intended or not but it does look horrible.  You've been warned.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|If Jung were alive this would be his favorite movie. I think God would like it, too. This movie pulls at our hearts because it delivers on a very profound truth: the best way to love someone is to let their reality in. This tale of father and son is about how difficult that can be, for both. This is not the son's story, it is the father's story told in the son. This movie is a real gift. There is an unseen spirit in our reality, a reality hard to capture or communicate. This film presents that spirit beautifully and presents it as a most precious gift.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|Not surprisingly, the performance of Juan Diego Florez makes this \\"Il Barbiere di Siviglia\\" special. I think of the role of Count Almaviva as third in importance behind that of Figaro and Rosina. But Florez has such a compelling stage presence and is such a spectacular Rossini tenor, that, like me, you may find yourself just waiting for him to come back onstage. (We are rewarded for our patience when he performs the difficult and usually omitted aria, \\"Cessa di piu resistere,\\" shortly before the curtain falls.) Throughout the opera, Florez's voice rings out with precision and crystal clarity. His vibrato gives the vocal lines an electric sound as if they're pulsating with energy. And he knows just how and when to embellish Rossini's score. It's simply bel canto and coloratura at its best.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't disappointed with any of the other performers, particularly because their voices blend so well in the ensemble pieces. Pietro Spagnoli as Figaro may not command the stage as we're used to (after all, the opera is named after him), but he has a rich, flexible baritone voice (flexible enough to match Rosina's fast running couplets in their famous duet, \\"Dunque io son,\\" a feat few Figaro baritones can pull off). Yes, Maria Bayo as Rosina omits a high note here and there, but her soprano voice has a lovely lyrical flow to it and she gives a spirited performance. She is having a great time onstage and it's infectious. It mattered not a bit to me that she's somewhat older than Florez, her love interest. Why shouldn't she be?<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed Bruno Practico's interpretation of Dr. Bartolo as a rather dim-witted buffa character rather than portraying him in the usual way as stuffy and pompous. Practico's approach integrates Dr. Bartolo into the stage action better and makes his \\"patter\\" music (the Act I aria, \\"A un dottor\\" and the Act II duet with Almavira, \\"Pace e gioia\\") more in line with the comic feel of the opera. He does a great job performing this difficult music. It's a treat to see the veteran Ruggero Raimondi as the amoral Don Basilio, booming out \\"La calunnia\\" in Act I and adding to the comic lunacy of Act II. Even Susana Cordon makes the most of her small role, giving us a wonderfully disheveled and quirky Berta but one who is shrewdly aware of exactly what's going on at every moment in Bartolo's household. Cordon gives an animated and funny rendition of her short Act II aria, a piece that often feels as if it's interrupting the action; but here it brings \\"bravas\\" from the audience.<br /><br />The sets, lighting, and costumes are inventive and show up well on the TV screen (opera DVD's are often so dark). I love the black and white motif, made comic with stripes, polka dots, and other assorted odd designs. The lighting designer was able to make black and white look as vivid as if he'd worked with a full palette. Then, at just the right moment, the black and white sets, costumes, and lighting give way to vivid colors and carry us to the end of this sparkling production.<br /><br />The bonus DVD contains informative interviews with the director, conductor, and performers.

B00003CXAE|5.0|This is one of my favorite, favorite, FAVORITE movies ever! I just love Sandy and Danny! And Rizzo is my fave character! This movie is infused with so many catchy tunes, you'll find yourself humming them randomly throughout the day!
1582701709|3.0|This book gives great insight into our lives.  We screwed up our lives ourselves.  There is no such thing as rape or murder.  There is only self-abuse and suicide.  There are no accidents!  Everything from the weather to traffic is our fault.  The only way we can save ourselves from this downward spiral is to change our thinking to positive.  If you do that then you will never have another problem.  This is the teaching and guarantee of this wonderful book.
B000A88F22|1.0|I caught this show on Vh1, and this show was absolutely atrocious. I never really thought much of Britney Spears, in fact I happen to enjoy some of Britney's past hits, but this show made me see what a trashy, narcissistic, air-headed person she truly is. All she did was ask everyone about their favorite sexual positions, and telling everyone else how many times she's done it with K-fed (Oh Lawd). Yes, then there is K-fed, I'm not sure if he actually spoke throughout the show, he did occasionally smile like a dumb ass, and now that I recall he did say a couple of things that sounded pretty idiotic like \\"love is love\\" (O RLY?) while Britney zoomed up close to him with her video camera, which for some reason she couldn't happen to hold straight. I did laugh when I saw Britney trying to interpret one of her hotel room paintings, and she pretty much says that the painting is about her and her situation with K-fed (No, Brit, not everything is about you, bb.). Last, but not least, the grand finale, the wedding, which was just tacky. So to summarize everything, this show was a certified hot mess.
1582701709|5.0|I found the book and movie and changed my life fast.  No more negatives and you ask and look for the abundance in your life.  It flows and works fast.  Love the book.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena delivers in this new cd another one of her remarkable journeys into the deeper layers of what it means to be alive on this beautiful planet in times of great duress and change.  McKennitt's tableau has all along been the poetic quest into the realm of spirit as we mortals know it, and by the rich textures of her musical themes, deeply nuanced lyrical structures and her beautiful and compellingly passionate vocals she invites us here on a new voyage into human aspiration, delight, anguish, curiosity and hope.   <br /> <br />Lovers of the profound will find rich reward in every hearing of this lovely album of divine, inspired music.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|For someone who can remember the Beatles as a youth growing up in England, this is a breath of fresh air which has brought back so many memories.  Brilliant mixes by George Martin and son bring a new and modern edge to many of the tracks but prove that the wonderful music written by the Beatles stands up to my generation like Sinatra etc did to my folks.  Great to get the air guitar out again too!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This is a must have! Very well done. This is a very talented chic. Great soul jazzy voice. Writes her own lyrics and plays the guitar. A total package. Buy it today.

MIRANDA
B00005JPAM|4.0|This is certainly a magnificent performance from Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. In fact the entire cast, particularly Michael Sheen as Prime Minister, Tony Blair and James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, all did fine performances. Great credit must go to the director, Stephan Frears, as has been mentioned, each well performed scene follow seamlessly and the story itself, screen writer, Peter Morgan managed to capture the feelings of the world at the death of Princess Diana and the apparent lack of compassion from the house of Windsor, specifically Queen Elizabeth.<br /><br />The film also approaches the debated issue whether the Monarchy is an out-dated institution, a thousand year line of monarchs that have ruled Britain and made this little island in the Atlantic, an empire not seen since the height of the Roman Empire. However times change, and since the French Revolution, the concept of Monarchy has been shown to be, at the least, superfluous, not paying tax and living off the people. The Nobility not paying tax was in fact one of the contributing factors in the creation of the French Revolution. If you talk to a social conscious Brit, they are either opposed to the institution and would like to see England become a republic or are true monarchists, conservative and wanting to see the customs and age old traditions continue because they contain values that are relevant even in our so-called modern times. This issue is tastefully explored and leans towards the institution remaining and adapting in our new millennium.<br /><br />We currently live in a world where our deepest fears and private concerns are broadcasted for all to hear and see. It is now fashionable to `wear our hearts on our sleeves' go on a popular talk shows and spill our guts out. This has not always been the case. In an older generation, a truly English attribute, was to not show emotion, keep a stiff upper lip, and carry through any crises with dignity. Queen Elizabeth the II worked as a mechanic during WW II, and was crowned Queen at a young age, and the first prime minister she had to deal with was Winston Churchill. To show `unnecessary' emotion during a time of loss was simply not done, and doing so, showed weakness. This new fashion to display emotion to the masses was beyond the queen's understanding and anathema to everything she represented. The notions of modernism and tradition and our changing sensibilities are the crux of the film.<br /><br />The film's ending gives the audience a clue as to the direction England is heading in terms of tradition and our modern world.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is absolutely Queen Elizabeth the II...almost scary in her portrayal of the monarch...suspending all disbelief, she had me believing she actually was the monarch...Oscar material in the realist sense.<br /><br />Good film.mechanic during WW II, and was crowned Queen at a young age, and the first prime minister she had to deal with was Winston Churchill.

B000F1IQNM|4.0|Nanny McPhee brings to the screen the story of a widowed father of seven who has great difficulty not so much in finding, but in keeping a nanny.  Things change when a strange woman arrives at his doorstep claiming that she can see the job through... <br />Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well. <br />In short, the music, the acting, the plot, the setting, and the dialogues are all good. <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars <br />
B0007TKNI8|5.0|I've seen this movie twenty times or more and I still love it.  The music it great, the story is great.  Somehow you want the phantom to win but know he can't.  It's just terrific.   I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't love this movie.

0064410935|5.0|What can one say?  This absolutely wonderful children's story deserves to be told and retold, and editions of it should always be coming along.  This edition is a great one.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|It's really tough to write a review that's equal to the effort and mastery on display here, and since many fine observations appear here already, I'll stick to notes. <br /> <br />Here,  you have twelve arresting duets. There are no bad songs here.  Some songs (\\"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\\") are more emotionally powerful and absorbing than others, which are merely clever and amusing (\\"Red Staggerwing\\"),  but none are bad. <br /> <br />There are no tear-it-up Sultans-of-Swing-like jams here; just a guitar that's confident enough to allow itself to be impressed into the service of the song.  Knopfler was always brilliant, but now, he's a confident grown-up to boot. <br /> <br />Knopfler's voice is indispensable to the success of the effort.  Harris' vocal ability is a given, but on some of the more heavily sentimental songs (\\"Love and Happiness\\"), it's Knopfler's hang-dog, tough-guy authenticity that saves the song from mawkishness and gives it the sweetness of genuine regard. <br /> <br />I believe that I will love this CD in five years.  What a delightful surprise.  I had no expectation that it'd be this good.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|uplifting, happy, makes you want to dance and sing, great for teens too.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Just as usual, Steve McQueen plays his role with magestry and unique style. Faye Dunaway does also a great job and her beauty is breath taking. One of the best McQueens feature film.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|You know how when you get a CD, you go through it and decide which treasures you'll download to the iPod?  Yeah, not with this CD.  All of them are worthy of the transport.  I am so glad I stumbled onto McKennitt's music.  I can't say enough about her beautiful vocals and the mystical flavor of the music created behind her.  Just sampling a couple tunes should be enough to convince you.  It was for me, and now I'm listening to this CD wherever I go.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|I have seen now almost all the Jane Eyres put out on film except for a rare silent version and a 1950's tv version. My favorite is the Timothy Dalton version and Orson Welles comes in a close second.<br />I must say latest remake is excellent<br />Though this version is not quite accurate to the book. I liked this movie and it's actors very much. The chemistry between Jane and Edward is dynamic, full of passion for each other with out over doing it.<br />Toby Stevens brings a totally refreshing and different performance to Mr Rochester, not dark or wonderfully sardonic as Orson or Timothy or crazed as Ciaran Hinds or underplayed and boring as William Hurt. He is strong and masculine with out being mean and manic and creates a very sexy and passionate Rochester with the aire of tortured mystery to him. Ruth Wilson plays a wonderfully waifish, winsome and bewitchingly fairie like Jane, quiet and calm but full of inner strength, compassion and understanding... she brings a wonderful intelligence to this role that is warm and pleasing. She makes a perfect Jane. The whole feel to this movie was intriguing.<br />The only part of the movie that really bothered me was the Gypsy scene... where in the book, Mr Rochester disguises himself and plays the gypsy to reading fortunes of all the single ladies, including Jane, when his intention was to make her ( Jane) jealous of Blanche Ingram and to draw her out more, to learn more of her.\\"<br />In most of the films made of Jane Eyre this scene is skipped totally. The only version that ever totally captured the spirit and essence of the gypsy sequence was the Dalton BBC film of Jane Eyre in the early 80's.  in this newest production it totally misses the mark. Rochester hires a gypsy woman instead of playing it himself He hides behind a screen to hear all the guests reactions whilst the fortunes are being told.<br />All in all I really do like  the modernized passion between the two main characters of this movie, and freshness theybring to it. purests may not care for it, but I think it very high quality and recomend it highly. I know I will be adding it to my collection<br /> Comment   Permalink
B000LE1FAY|5.0|As a fan of Enzo Enzo, Paris Combo, Patricia Kaas and others, I approached this release with great skepticism.  But within moments my critical ear slowly relaxed and in no time the illusion was complete; I became completely one with the music and entered the France of Berlinda's imagination.  These songs are nothing new.  We've heard them performed by countless chanteur et chanteuse.  Why should this recording make any difference?  Its in the fantastic arrangements, fresh and envigorating interpretations.  Oui?  Merci, Belinda for taking big chances and bringing us a wonderful album outside of the pop genre as we know it. You may not have a star on the walk in Hollywood, but now in our hearts you will be an etoile de Paris!
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Grobin has such a soulful, angelic, and addictive voice. He could sing the phone book and I'd listen.  I have never even (being an old time rock and roller) been close to liking opera--three tenors... phooey--though I've tried to expand my musical horizons by listening to it. But, when Josh sings it, it stirs my heart and I want more. I remember the first time I heard Josh Grobin on the Ally McBeal show.  He not only blew my socks off, he curled my tootsies.  This album is true to his voice and his style(s).  It'll be played often.  It will probably never be put back on the shelf with my hundreds of other CDs.  I can't go for long without a dose of Josh.  Does that sound like a groupie?  At my age, I'm well past that.  At my age, I know *beauty* when I hear it, pure and simple--not just ear candy, it's ear \\"honey\\".
B000JK8OYU|5.0|When I was watching the news and i saw their was a show in the making for the Beatles i made sure it was there when i went to Las Vegas. And lucky for me it was. I got this cd a week before i actually went and only thought it was ok, but then i saw the show and i have been listening to this cd so much. im such an avid beatles fan, my mother has nearly all their albums so i have heard all of their songs so many times. The show makes the songs sound fantastic because it actually matched to what the song was saying. if you dont like this cd and are a Beatles fan then you should go see the show
B000I5X80G|5.0|I totally agree with the reviews that say this is a unique cd both in terms of the sound quality but more importantly the virtuosity Crazy Horse displayed that night at the Fillmore. For those who get the DVD, I say the pictures add to the music wonderfully. There is no video from that night and maybe it is for the best because the music always is in the foreground while the pictures provide a nice background. The music is incredible in spite of the fact that the songs are so familiar; the performance still comes through as a thoroughly unique experience special to the occasion. Even if you have heard these songs a million times, you can not miss just how on this band was this special night. It is a joy to listen to. I can't wait for Massey Hall. Bring it on! One after another.
B000I5X81K|1.0|I felt almost sad the first time I heard this CD ,I had such high expectations . For me it's the choice of songs , he should stick with Romance or Love songs .
B000BW7QWW|4.0|The combination of good story and solid acting makes this movie very enjoyable.  This one belongs in my collection.  Well done.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is a great household tool. I have had this sweeper for over a year and am back to order another one for downstairs. It does a fantastic job picking up kitty litter. I would recommend it for anyone with a kitty litter box. I ordered it with an extra battery and haven't had any problems with either battery or durability of the sweeper but I only use it for little jobs and use a vacuum for overall cleaning. Great tool for the price.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Love the series love the DVD. If you are a fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy you have to get this. The retelling of the overall world is great and the acting is supurb. You'll get hooked.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|Great music from a great new metal band.  These guys will go very far with their careers.  Keep up the good work guys!
B000J10EQU|3.0|To watch this movie, you have to have some background on Superman's story because the movie from start to finish is kind of a continuation. Superman returns to Metropolis after 5 years from Klingon. Clark Kent resumes a job at the Daily Planet. He finds out Louis Lane (Kate Bogsworth) is involved with someone else but he is still in love with her and Louis Lane is still in love with Superman. Then there are some scenes were Superman has to defend the planet and you get to see how much power he has - he can move airplanes, get shot numerous times and have no effect, fly, etc. Then there is a simple plot with Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey).  Interestingly, the movie was 2 and a 1/2 hours long but I felt like I was watching one episode of Superman, not a movie. <br /> <br />Kate Bogsworth does not seem like a Louis Lane at all. First, she looks like a girl, not a woman. Second, she has this bad attitude from beginnging to end.  The actors who plays superman/Clark Kent (I read that they were actually two people)do a good job.  Kevin Spacey does fair. There was not much he could do with the script and plot. The whole movie seems kind of dreary and dark. This movie is good to watch if you are a fan of Superman, and there are some great effects also. The only thing missing was a good storyline.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Not one of their albums to get a lot of notice, but one of my all time favorites. Warning, Macy's Day Parade, and one of my top 5 GD Songs Minority make this a must own.
B000002AT6|5.0|Have you ever seen a movie before and loved it for no other reason than the soundtrack?  I love Legends of the Fall.  Not because the storyline is fantastic or because Brad Pitt is dreamy.  No, I love the movie because of the music.  I actually bought this cassette tape ten years ago in a second hand store.  I had never seen the movie but for $.25 I thought, what the hay.  It quickly became my favorite cassette and now CD ever.  While many movie scores have moved me, nothing has ever been quite like Horner's Legends.  The emotion, the gradure of Montana, the fall of the family is beautifully expressed in the music.  If I had to be stranded on a desert island for the rest of my life and could only take one CD, this would be it.
B000002N2P|5.0|I acutally like this album more than Dookie, and I love Dookie. Jaded, Brain Stew, Geek Stink Breath, and my favorite on the album Walking Contradiction. Great album for a road trip. Send your speeding tickets to the band ;)
B000H0MKGK|5.0|For anyone who has loved or lost love.  <br />Wonderful melodies and catchy lyrics. <br />\\"Waiting on the world to change\\", \\"Gravity\\", \\"Bold as Love\\", and \\"Slow Dancing in a burning Room\\" are all sure to be lifelong favorites.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|As Steve Vai once said, You can't say \\"my noise is better than your noise.\\" If people like this album and Saddam Hussein doesn't, that's okay. Music is a vibration; you either respond or you don't and either way is not \\"wrong.\\" Amen. <br /> <br />When Stevie Ray Vaughan first hit the airwaves, I felt as though someone was finally playing the music I'd always waited for from Clapton. Truth is, Eric moved in a singer/songwriter direction, and SRV stayed committed to the blues. EC's early days were exceptional on that count, from Crossroads to Hideaway, Have You Heard, etc. But I realized somewhere along the way that though he started with the blues, EC had demonstrated that he was versatile and pleasantly complex and probably wouldn't end there. He moved into the singer/songwriter spectrum, especially as other electric blues players came up and laid fire in new ways to the old tunes (Joe Bonamassa). This album is okay and I'm glad he resurrected the tunes. Lots of discipline and restraint, hard-earned maturity. But it isn't a show stopper and he seems increasingly less inclined to savage his axe. His voice is the highlight here, not his playing. That moved offstage a long time ago. And so did I.
B0001I562I|4.0|I was shocked at the language. I guess we have always watched an edited version on TV. My kids had loved the show when they were younger so I bought it for the grandkids to watch and was surprised to find there were several cuss words that weren't in the TV version. Nothing you don't hear on TV today but still might  not be  something some people would want their 5 year olds to hear. Cute story though and good special effects.
B000002G8H|5.0|This is, in my personal opinion, by far the best Eric clapton album. We all have our own choice of music & albums of favourite Rock stars are no different.  <br /> <br />The album starts with Cocaine. I never get tired of listening to cocaine -the best song on this album - great tunes, amazing vocals. wonderful tonight is my next favourite - the classic Hit that you will occasionally hear in soap operas. If you are on the romantically inclined side, you will love this love song. \\"Lay down sally\\" is another big hit song and I dont have to say more. \\"Next time you see her\\" is one of those repetitive catch-line songs that you cannot get enough out of and you find yourself singing the line over and over again when you are at work.  <br /> <br />You have to have an acquired taste to enjoy \\"We're all the way\\". \\"The core\\" - Eric comes out with his strong guitar skills on this one. Its simply awesome. It also has very nice vocals of Marcy Levy. \\"May you never\\" and \\"Mean old frisco\\" are good songs if you are in the right mood - listening to good songs mood! \\"Peaches and diesel\\" is a Rich guitar/ drums instumental piece which at first sounds like \\"wonderful tonight\\" but its really not and it just sounds wonderful. <br /> <br />I have been listening to the vinyl format of this album but I recently switched to CD. I do have to confess that I like listening to vinyl because I think certain albums sound much better on vinyl but thats just me. vinyl or CD, there is a reason why Eric clapton is nicknamed \\"slowhand\\". Dont take my word for it. listen to the album and you will find out that I was right afterall!  <br />
B00005JPFQ|2.0|Overall, Ghost Rider was a waste of two hours. Nothing memorable other than Eva Mendes and her cleavage. Nic Cage was decent, but didn't seem to be trying that hard. The CGI was better than the trailers would lead you to believe, but it was nothing I haven't seen done better before. The worst part of the film was the villians and how easy they were defeated. This isn't the worst comic book adaptation, but it deserves a spot somewhere on that list. Wait for the DVD!
0143038419|5.0|I did not want this book to end.  There was one surprise after another.  It helps that Elizabeth is bright and an excellent writer.  I marvelled at the well turned pharases and appreciated her humor.   The book has several layers.  The reader gets a sense of what it is like to live in Italy, expecially Rome, in an ashram in India, and in Bali.  More importantly this is a book about Elizabeth's spiritual transformation.  That includes a moment of surrender, listening to the \\"still small voice\\" for guidance; rigorous spiritual disciplines, espccially meditation,  meeting and learning from some very wise people, all infused with the surprising and powerful Grace of God.  Elizabeth is a very outgoing person who attacts interesting people to her.  Getting to know those people is part of the experince too.  Some people who call themselves spiritual have a \\"Lite\\" spirituality--a feel good experience.  Not Elizabeth.  Hers is an authentic spiritual experience that includes letting go, healing, forgiving, listening, trusting, and growing in compassion.  If bearing fruit is the mark of an authentic spirtiual experience, her compassion for Wayan is but one clear evidence that her experience is authentic. If a miracle is good things happening that you did not expect, then this book is full of miracles.  As I read the book I could not help but wonder what it would be like to write a book about a year in your life for which the publishers have given you an advance to do so.  Does that make living that year more intentional for her? If any of us were given an advance to do the same, would we live a more intentional and interesting life?  Thanks to the publishers for the faith they put in her.  It turned out to be an inspiration to me and many other readers I'm sure.  Elizabeth ends the year a much stronger, more centered, self-aware, compassionate human being.  While we each have to discover our own path, she gives hope that transformation is possible.
B000000OXH|4.0|Not as focused as the first ASIA. Yet it contains their 2 best songs of their career, Midnight Sun and Open Your Eyes and for those 2 gems it should not be overlooked. The band was breaking up and you can here it in the stale arrangments, but It's still very good 80's pop rock.
0060763280|4.0|While I found Harv's book very interesting and full of the \\"right stuff\\" as many reviewers note, I am struggling with how one focuses on building wealth in today's environment of the inevitable coming demographics driven collapse. Is there enough time left? Arnold's The Great Bust Ahead, which I read two years ago, has a 100% track record so far on its predictions, and has its primary prediction of a massive depression starting perhaps as early as 2009-10 and lasting 14 years now closing in on us. (The book's thegreatbustahead site is a good read). How does one build wealth with this looming? It seems that everything I do now should be progressively more and more defensive.
B000000OMB|5.0|After the disasterous 1978-79 tours of Yes ELP and UK, these 4 ex-prog kings got together to make a pop rock quartet to make some cash to pay off their debts. Little did they know they would make a great classic album and even go to Number 1 in the charts! Not bad for 4 prog dinosaurs in the new wave/punk era.
B00002616T|5.0|Funky, ethereal, free, melodic, romantic, edgy...and classic.  Jarrett, sharing the spotlight with Garbarek, offers a program of such variety and sheer finger-snapping lyricism that any jazz lover would be silly not to give it a listen.<br /><br />The recording clarity and richness is one of ECM's finest - head and ears above most of what has come out in the last 35 years.<br /><br />Garbarek, for those of you who know his more ethereal and folky work, is at his Coleman/Coltrane/Rahsaan peak here - sailing, moaning, tossing tart, lopsided and twisty rhythmic nuggets into the mix one moment, going deeply gospel or romantic the next. A tone like deep-fried ice cream.<br /><br />Christenson, too - groove, experiment, agility, shading and tone, poly-rhythms - will appeal to fans  of touches of DeJohnette, Erskine, Motian, Haynes and even Murray and Cyrille, but really a singular drummer.  George Russell, who featured Jan and Jon in the late sixties, commented that for some reason, Norwegians seemed to swing like they came from 125th Street, but with their own kind of blues.  Danielsson is a lyrical, fat-toned bassist who digs deep, anchoring driving and inspiring the soloists. An under-appreciated bassist who has a real showcase here.<br /><br />Jarrett is contained, in the best sense - sensitive as ever to the songs, grooving deeply and flying - especially on The Windup, a real showcase piece alternating between the funky labyrinth of the head and the free-blow of the solos.<br /><br />There is no reason not to have this album. It is a jazz watershed.
0316172324|4.0|We have all been warned against the practice of \\"judging a book by its cover.\\"  But is it OK to judge a book by its title?  After hearing a friend talk about this book I looked it up on Amazon and was intrigued by the title.  Not \\"Blink\\", but the part about \\"thinking without thinking.\\"  As a person who tends to do his best when allowed to fly by the seat of his pants, I was immediately attracted to the potential subject matter of this curious little book.<br /><br />There are two concepts that make up the bulk of this book's foundation -- thin slicing and rapid cognition.  It could be considered an expansion on the idea that our first impressions are frequently correct and that our sub-conscience is usually aware of things taking place in our surroundings much sooner that we are.  The book also tells us that thin slicing and rapid cognition can be fooled or succumb to personal prejudice, and hence turn out to be completely wrong.  And still Blink tells us that this can be overcome, or at least controlled, by learning to block out certain senses that cause us to proceed from false assumptions.  Example: A college study where individuals were studied by two groups of graduate students.  One that conduced a brief face-to-face interview, and a second that was allowed to very briefly study the contents of the individuals room without knowing anything about the person.  The ones that performed the face-to-face interviews were less accurate because they made mistakes at the start of the interview -- mistakes such as this person is an athlete so he/she does not enjoy scholarly pursuits -- and so forth.<br /><br />The book starts off with a fascinating account of an ancient Greek statue on display in a New York museum.  After over a year of scientific and historical analysis the statue is certified to be authentic.  Meanwhile several amateurs begin having some interesting first impressions about the new exhibit -- guess which group ends up being correct?  While there are other interesting stories and accounts along the way, once the ideas of thin slicing and rapid cognition get explained, parts of the book seem redundant and at times the book seems to get longer as one gets closer to the ending.  Still, there are ideas and techniques discussed in this book that are valuable.  I did enjoy the comparison between the Blind Taste test (as used by Pepsi/Coke in the late 1970's) and the Triangle test -- the concept of comparing two subjects by offering three samples and having the tester determine, not which one is better, but determine which one is not like the other two.<br /><br />I was torn between rating this book as a 3 star or a 4 star.  Ultimately I decided to go with 4 (because I had a BLINK moment) because the ideas in the book are good ones, even if one does have to wade though some repetition.  Also, one thing kept occurring to me as I was reading this book.  I kept having this repeating thought telling me that this book was wrong.  However, those little thoughts are largely what this book is about.  If my impressions about the book are correct, then the book must be on to something.  On the other hand, if my impressions are incorrect, then the book was not in fact wrong, but correct -- nice little paradox that works in Mr Gladwell's favor.  See what reading this book does to a person.<br /><br />One last bit of closing information.  This book seems to be a guaranteed conversation piece.  I have had more comments book then anything I have ever left laying around the house.  And it is not done on purpose.  Again, something working very well for Mr. Gladwell.stories and accounts along the way, once the ideas of thin slicing and rapid cognition get explained, parts of the book seem redundant and at times the book seems to get longer as one gets closer to the ending.  Still, there are ideas and techniques discussed in this book that are valuable.  I did enjoy the comparison between the Blind Taste test (as used by Pepsi/Coke in the late 1970's) and the Triangle test -- the concept of comparing two subjects by offering three samples and having the tester determine, not which one is better, but determine which one is not like the other two.    I was torn between rating this book as a 3 star or a 4 star.  Ultimately I decided to go with 4 (because I had a BLINK moment) because the ideas in the book are good ones, even if one does have to wade though some repetition.  Also, one thing kept occurring to me as I was reading this book.  I kept having this repeating thought telling me that this book was wrong.  However, those little thoughts are largely what this book is about.  If my impressions about the book are correct, then the book must be on to something.  On the other hand, if my impressions are incorrect, then the book was not in fact wrong, but correct -- nice little paradox that works in Mr Gladwell's favor.  See what reading this book does to a person.    One last bit of closing information.  This book seems to be a guaranteed conversation piece.  I have had more comments book then anything I have ever left laying around the house.  And it is not done on purpose.       Again, something working very well for Mr. Gladwell.
006112429X|1.0|Like many of the negative reviewers, I found Kevin and his parents about the most unbelievable characters I've ever encountered in a lifetime of reading. Kevin's \\"bad seed-ness\\" is so over the top that I wondered if Shriver wasn't indulging in black humor and that we were meant to find the whole thing a ridculous joke, a riff on America's refusal to recognize its evil nature much like the utterly unbelievable Dad character never notices that Kevin is the devil incarnate and the mother character, the one who does notice it, never does a thing about it but argue with her husband. Let's see, Dad is a red state, mom a blue, Kevin the monsterousness of the ugly America of the end of the twentieth century, rather than doing anything whatsoever they choose to fight it out, which lets the ugliness run free to stomp on the innocent dummies (the rest of America, embodied in the book by the passive-beyond-all-believe Celia and the multicultural murdered classmates). It actually almost works as a book this way, but the sadism and bitterness with which the author throws herself into the task make one wonder just what her intent might have been.  <br /> <br />The author and I have a similar biography - the best written parts of the book were about the mother character's need to get away from America, the paradox of loving and hating travel and the frustrations of female ambition. Been there, done that, well done, but its ancillary to the rest of the book, which is horrid nonsense. Well written nonsense, but nonsense none the less.   <br /> <br />The Russian writers may be one of Shriver's declared influences, but it's the Steven King-like accumulation of gross outs that is providing the heft here, which many readers seem to have mistaken for seriousness of purpose.  Steven King's plots are actually more realistic, really, have a look at one, you'll see.  In King's novels characters actually react to horrible acts of violence, even if its space aliens or monsters from hell that are the perpetrators. In Shriver's book, the lack of reaction to the monster Kevin and his constant stream of too-creative cruelties, makes the entire premise preposterous.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is the definitive documentary series on the Second World War. It's a good introduction and overview before any serious research through written materials. It helped form my facination with history while in high school. Over thirty years later, I am now on op-ed political columnist. Still love the series.
B000ETQPYM|5.0|This was a very good story detailing the year after Holly's young husband passed away from a brain tumor.  He keeps his promise and leaves her notes to open each month to help her reach one goal at a time until she makes it through an entire year.  Written with great sensitivity and often raucus humor, and wit,  Cecelia Ahern does a marvelous job of letting us in the world Holly finds at first to be meaningless. Introduces us to her family and friends who mourn with her to their individual ability and then moves the story along to healing and forward thinking with hope and love.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|This is fine, but it should have been the remastered THX edition of the Classic Original that was released on VHS tape years ago before the Special Editions come out.  I am not saying a VHS to DVD transfer but the restored masters that they created the VHS tapes with should have been used.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I haven't seen the musical yet (though I've been dying to and tried with all my might to get tickets when they were in town). I've learned the whole score and can sing most of it by memory. I love almost all of the songs and have plans to use one of them for an audition soon.<br /><br />However, the musical storyline is much different from the book storyline that I adored. That sometimes makes it difficult to imagine where in the story the songs are about (like Glenda being engaged to Fiyero).<br /><br />Other than that, I loved this score. It's become one of my new favorites and is always being played on my iPod.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|A movie that cost $25,000,000 to make and grossed only $18,000,000 in the box office. Yet it garnered 7 Oscar Nominations. This movie was the #1 rented flick in 1995! Took a while to catch on.<br /><br />One of my favorites. Dark, enigmatic, yet beautiful. The score for this movie is moving and disturbing. Make sure to watch the extras! Well worth the time.<br /><br />A TRUE (*****) movie.
B000FQVY2C|5.0|There is a very good reason this classic has recently been re-released. I put it along side Odessey and Oracle and Village Green Preservation Society as high-minded pop gems that were sort of forgotten and now are getting a renewed appreciation. <br />Other than a little bit of a muddled production this is a first class album. The mood is melancholy, but perfectly such. Although the songs are instantly catchy, they have such depth that they won't bore.  <br />If you like gentle, blue pop music that has a decidely British feel. Get this. Actually if you like good music at all, pick this up.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Though Carlos Santana has achieved many accomplished works over the course of almost 40 years in modern music, this CD is among my top 20 favorites of all time. I just acquired the re-mastered version, having had the cassette tape for many years. Carlos Santana has proven with this album that he is the King of the Latin percussion-infused jams. His unique blend of rhythm, distorted soulful organ riffs and fiery guitar solos have achieved him musical distinction, beginning nearly 40 years ago.<br /><br />When I heard \\"Waiting\\" for the first time in a long time, it made me want to get up and do the rhumba. Even better than that, the integral \\"Shades of Time/Savor\\" had me looking for the nearest furniture that I could play the congas on. This music is definitely addicting and the re-mastered version includes three tracks recorded at Woodstock.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.
B000I0QM04|5.0|If you missed this movie - now is the time to try it in HD! Shame that the movie failed at the box office, but it's good to own it now in Blu Ray. Nice transfer, though the movie itself is very soft visioned, so you won't get this very special sharpness feeling (like i.e. with Mi:3)
B000HIVO64|4.0|Beck is the one of the best musicians today and never disappoints.  The cd is a great listen.  \\"I think I'm in love\\" is my favorite track on the new disc.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I'd seen this at the movies and wanted to see the additional information added since, it was well worth it.  Especially the Director's and Producer's commentary - it wasn't made known during the movie that Al doesn't get paid for these slide shows he's been showing for years, and I think that's important from impartiality perspective.  Being from outside the US, politics there is viewed with such huge cynism, because it requires so much money to be a candidate, so you never feel you can trust a politician.  It's a shame that some of the commentary about Al personally wasn't in the original movie as it wasn't necessarily a good thing that it was him fronting it (for all the aforementioned reasons) from a foreign perspctive anyway.  I respect him so much more now though!  A great message Al, and come on US government, at least ratify Kyoto!!!
1400032717|5.0|This is one of those life-changing books. It was recommended to me by the mom of an autistic kid. It's a fast read, and there's no reason you shouldn't read it, particularly if you work with autistic kids. <br /> <br />Even if you don't, it's wonderfully enlightening.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Can't say enough about this film.  Rented it so many times that it was cheaper to purchase!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|lets see, Martin Scorsese has really been on a role these past seven years. first, he scored with Gangs of New York. not his greatest but still a complete joy. then he scored again with The Aviator, a bit softer then his other movies yet again, another great film. but this movie really takes the cake. definitnly his best film since Casino, Scorsese once again teams up with new right hand actor Leonardo DiCaprio to make this crackling good film based on the popular Hong Konh flick Internal Affairs but instead of Hong Kong, the action has been shifted to the strees of Boston. we find young rookie cop Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) given a very important assignment. the task? to become a mole and put into the viciouse mob ring run by Frank Costello (Nicholson), its is then he must win over Costello's trust and help his handlers (Wahlberg and Sheen) bring him down. meanwhile fellow cop Colin Sullivan (Damon) has his owen agenda to fill. no one suspects that he happens to be Costello's own mole. all these cover ups, double crosses, and broad assemble may seem a bit confussing but you'll easily get the picture once the film gets going. its violent, bloody, and so pumped with adreniline you will be exhausted by the films end. and let me be the first to say, lets just pray that this film finally gets Scorsese the Oscar he truly deserves, god knows he's been screwed over one two many times already. the performences are also a key drive to this film, DiCaprio, Damon, Nicbolson, and Wahlberg all give outstanding performences. i was a bit shocked that Nicholson didn't get nominated but Wahlberg is also a good choice. so, if you want to see a epic Scorsese flick and one of this years best films then say hello to the Departed.
B00008NRL8|5.0|A very nice French lady called Anne-Marie gave me this disc a few weeks ago and I've been listening to it ever since. I watch the American remake of the Japanese film, \\"Shall We Dance\\", last week and I noticed that the music of Gotan Project was used very effectively when Richard Geer dances with J-Lo.<br /><br />I listened to \\"La Revancha del Tango\\" this Sunday afternoon. It was around 40 degrees outside - damned hot! - and I just sat and listened to this disc with my air conditioner on full blast. I rather think that I will play this CD the next time I have some friends over for a few drinks.<br /><br />The music of Gotan Project is rather hypnotic and relentless on this CD. I like that. I guess that one could call this \\"Tango-Trance\\", or something like that?! The percussion/drums, bass line, piano and piano accordion dominates the sound here.<br /><br />I've been playing \\"Lunatico\\" at work all week and I like it, too. Gotan Project is performing in Adelaide, South Australia soon and I am seriously considering making the effort to see them.<br /><br />Very spunky, suave and sexy dance music.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|in the bible, it is said that a united group of humans took up the task to build a great tower to reach the heavens. God, observing these many people united in the contruction, sought to destroy the tower and scatter the humans to the farthest reaches of the globe and confussing the languages, never again to be able to build the tower. in Babel which derives it name from the tower, the lives of many intersect with just a single action that affect all the people in more then one ways. a follow up to his 2003 flick, 21 Grams, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu delivers a searing drama that can definintly be called this years Crash (though a heck of a lot better) using the premise of the biblical story, we see four interwoven stories that all are somehow connected to a single event. two kids playing with a gun suddenly gets find themselves in a very nasty situation. a husband and wife (Pitt and Blanchett) vacationing in Morroco suddenly find themselves in a perilous dilhema when they find themselves in a perilous flight of life and death. a nanny (Barraza) left in care of her employers children decides to take them to her sons wedding which leads to tragic events. a deaf Japanese girl (Kikuchi), angry at the world for her disability, seeks a way to rebel against her father and all those who have what she does not. it is then with a single gun fire that all these people connect with one another and how it all acumilates in an ending that will be happy for some, tragic for others. the true driving force of the film is the performences. Pitt brings his best performence since 12 Monkeys and it surprises me that he didn't get nominated. Barraza is supremly moving as the loving nanny but i feel the standout of the film is Rinko Kikuchi's fierce turn as the deaf teen Chieko. everytime she is on screen, she blares like a silent siren with such raw force and power that her performence joins the likes of other great none speakign roles like Marlee Matlin and Holly Hunter. the music also brings some depth to the film, Santaoalalla really blends in the music to make it all seem more real. my favorite scene is the very end (spoiler alert) when Chieko and her father hug on the balconey, it really got to me that scene. a truley epic film, Babel is definently one of 2006 most outstanding films.o brings some depth to the film, Santaoalalla really blends in the music to make it all seem more real. my favorite scene is the very end (spoiler alert) when Chieko and her father hug on the balconey, it really got to me that scene. a truley epic film, Babel is definently one of 2006 most outstanding films.

B0001ZX0OW|3.0|You have a cast that includes Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Laurence Fishburne, Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, and Marcia Gay Harden.  This elite cast is directed by Clint Eastwood.  The story is meaty and suspenseful.  Can't miss, right?<br /><br />It can and does miss, in my opinion.  What makes it just miss is an acting fundamental that most did not pay attention to, and that is diction and enunciation.  These actors use sotto voce too much, fake Boston accents with varying degrees of accuracy and precision, and generally speak as though they have a mouth full of marbles.  I had to turn my TV volume to 48 to hear some of the dialogue.  That dialogue is usually important in a movie or play, and in this film, it is critical.  As any high school drama teacher will tell you...if the audience can't hear you, you are cheating them.<br /><br />This is generally the only mar on an otherwise fine film.  All of the actors turn in very good performances, particularly Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Marcia Gay Harden.  Robbins plays David Boyle, a man who cannot escape the horror and trauma of his rape by pedophiles at a young age.  He carries himself with sadness, and his internal rage and confusion show in his face and body.  His wife Celeste is capably played by Marcia Gay Harden.  Her fear grows as she comes to believe that her husband may have murdered a 19 year old girl. In a panic, she turns to the murdered girl's father (Jimmy) and tells him that she believes that her husband is the killer.  In this scene of ultimate betrayal, Harden is at her best.  We see it all...relief to have unburdened herself, but guilt and fear knowing that she has likely signed the death warrant of her own husband.  Finally, there is Sean Penn's portrayal of Jimmy.  Jimmy is an ex-con, who lost a wife as he was going to prison, and then loses the daughter of that wife. He is a man trying desperately to hold it together and operate within the legal rules of society.  In the end, his desire for street thug retribution wins out, and his guilt is palpable.  Penn turns in a great performance.<br /><br />So, the movie basically goes from 5 stars to 3 stars because a director didn't insist on clear speech.  But hey, if that doesn't bother you, you'll probably find this to be an outstanding, disturbing, impactful film.<br /><br />Recommended.s out, and his guilt is palpable.

B00003CY6M|5.0|This is such a great movie. It keeps you guessing until the end. A search for the one true love that got away keeps a man from making any kind of commitment. On the eve of his wedding he makes one last ditch effort to find the mystery woman. This movie has some inappropriate bedroom scenes so I can't recommend it for the whole family.
0618680004|5.0|With over 500 reviews to date on this book I will not attempt to cover what so many have already written in more detailed and concise prose. I want to concentrate on the things that Dawkins feels are important and how I either agree or disagree with him.    No rational person, able to think independently, free from the bonds of cultural and mythic indocrination, can come to a conclusion other than Dawkins' own in this book. Religion can be a baleful influence in the modern world. It is the imposition of medieaval myth and cultural pandering to belief systems that are getting us into trouble in the modern world. We are better to put the Bible on the shelf along with Plato and Socrates and Lao Tzu and all the other literary works of the world canon of literature. The Bible cannot, under any rational assumption, be the true \\"word\\", and it cannot be a source of morality that equates with anything remotely familiar to what modern rational people actually believe and practise in the modern day.     Religion in its extreme forms, persists because of three things: ignorance, cultural indoctrination, and economic pressures to believe (cf. there has never been a US President that ever publically professed that he was an aetheist -- though surely this has been the case in many presidents in the 20th Century and even Thomas Jefferson intoned as much as he could be allowed to say in his private writings of the 18th Cen. -- to say as much, even today, would be enough to disqualify a candidate from even running. Much the same applies to university positions and any high public).    The problem is of course many maifestations of reliion. The problem with the book in my estimation is that Dawkins will have no half-measures in his polemics -- it is not just the baleful influence of the Pat Robertson, Jim Baker, Mormans, mullahs or terrorist bombers we need to fear -- it is religion itself that needs to be thrown out. And this means all crooked thinking; from those rapture-drunk US southern fundamentalists and Bamiyan blasting Taliban, through mainstream churchs of Catholicism and Anglicism (even Unitarianism???), right to deluded modern \\"new-age\\" religions and similar muddle-headed systems of belief. A thorough-going aetheisism and scientific understanding of the world is the only thing that, in Dawkins view, can save mankind.     But Dawkins is surely wrong in his assertion that all relgious thought is created equal. There have not been too many cases of fundementalist aethiests building wonderful monunments, churches paintings in reverence to their belief. Aetheists may have in the 20th Century certainly in their communist and nazi guises been responsible for more mass killing than their religious numbers, at least in the Christian world. On the other hand there has not been any raving aetheists threatening to blow people up in their beliefs or acting with considerable christian uncharity to gays, people with aids, or threating to hang Darwists.     I personally benefited growing up in a non-denominational family. We did try some churches for a time and then we as a family lapsed into a sort of inactive agnosticism. I did have friends who were thorough-going church members and I was fortunate enough that these people were some of the most compassionate and morally-centred people I have met. I remember visiting the local parson, learning guitar from his son, engaging in passionate aetheistic thought even as a young teenager. He would caution that I was free to believe what I would like... and he left it at that.... He is the equivalent of the \\"English Country Parson\\" many of us grew up with, and he regularly invited the homeless for a meal.    Today I also seek out people in most mainstream churches. I have recently tried to be a sort of part-time member of the congregation of my local catholic church. I do this simply because the people are what you might call, well, rather nice, and they are able to engage about all sorts of social topics with an over-riding compassion for their fellow-man (again this contrasts with the US phenomenon of negative activism -- hatred of gays, Darwinists etc.). They run a local soup kitchen and helping those down on their luck is just what one does. I have hosted teas and the the priest believes in Darwinism as a prima-fisca thought. All of the people in congregation feel much the same.     So if I am more or less a practising aetheist, why would I associate with this group of people, much less actually give them money? The answer is really my answer to Dawkins own sort of fundementalism (and it is not fundementalism in the way that we say Christian or Muslim fundementalist). The hardline aspects of religion, any ideology, are truly fearful -- no one can deny that indoctrinating your children in the eucharist, believing the Bible is really true, or teaching your children that Darwinism is untrue, or that their friends will go to hell when they die because they are the wrong religious persuation -- no rathional thinking individual can deny that this is wrong and harmful.     But the influence of those that I have been lucky enough to associate with in mainly conventional or reformed western religious circles have taught me that they are a force for good. I do share a common morality with them. We do agree that it is important to help people to read, to feed the poor, to have an active social system in education that teaches and active belief in Science and charity. We do beleive that it is wrong to be hateful for a person because of their sexual disposition or even their religious faith. We do believe that stopping global warming is one of the most important issues on the agenda and we do believe (largely) in women preists.     Why would Dawkins want to staunch this cooperation between active doubters and Agnnostics and socially progressive churches around the world. I feel that Dawkins is throwing the baby out with the bath water. There is much that can be achieved by enrolling these reformed impulses. All of these reformed groups are at home with modernity. In final analysis Dawkins elludes to the benefit he experienced being exposed to the kindly parish priest so prevalent in much of England, and Canada(and, frankly speaking, a goodly part of the US). Dawkins wants to metaphorically \\"kill\\" this kindly old person -- they are enemies because of their belief. In my world I strive for the same ends as Dawkins, but the country priest is my friend and ally against the forces of fundamentalist darkness and therefore will remain my friend.    According to Dawkins, this may not be logically correct, but it is truly how I react and feel, and, I suspect, it is also very similar to how Dawkins himself also feels but not how he logically represents his ideas.     All in all a wonderful book, well meant, well written!

B000E9910W|5.0|Great Compilation for the Great Doobie Brothers. The two things I noticed was the missing chart information for Another Park, Another Sunday which made #32 on the US singles chart, so that should have been on there, also the single Takin it to the Streets made #13 not #3,which is what it says. The information is good but the info on the Greatest Hits is better. Someone should double check this stuff before putting out a greatest hits compilation.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|Wait for the DVD.  Yea I had a good, fun time watching this, but it was definatly not worth 20 bucks(Food, drinks, tickets.  Little bags of candy for 4 bucks!?  Such a ripoff.  Anyways...) its a fun movie, but it tries too hard, and it doesn't know what it wants to be.  For exaample, it has some pretty serious stuff going on(Demons, Satan, Hell) and it tries to make it into a campy Spiderman-like movie with \\"great\\" one-liners.   <br /> <br />The first problem is that Nick Cage is no Tobey Maguire.  I remember telling one of my friends that the movie was great as long as we didn't see Cage's face.  And the most I laughed occured when a baby(Yes a little baby, please people, don't bring little kids into movie theatres!)started crying right after Ghost Rider turned back into Nick Cage.  And I do seperate them because I rooted for Ghost Rider, I really did.  But Nick Cage........well......I wouldn't have been too heartbroken if he got beaten to a pulp. <br /> <br />Getting back to the first's paragraphs problem.  So we've got Devils and stuff running around and the movie feels like a horror movie that doesn't want to be a horror movie.  I think this would have been better as a darker \\"R\\" rated movie.  Spidey and the Fantastic Four are built for witty one-liners and just campy fun, this movie had a serious feel to it. <br /> <br />Now to the Direction.  Its not that great.  MSJ really needs to stop it.  Daredevil was an alright 3/5 movie, but it could have been so much more, just as this could have.  The effects are good, although some segments do feel like a video game.   <br /> <br />It does have some cool effects and the villains are nasty but Nick Cage brings it down.  I just could not see him as Ghost Rider.  Overall this is a cool, fun, little movie to watch with some buddies but it comes nowhere near the greatness of Spiderman or Batman.

B000068IEU|2.0|...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas.\\"Horror-and-brutality technology\\" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved.
0385486804|5.0|This is a great non-fiction page turner.  Very interesting investigation into the mind of a very misguided young man.  As a high school teacher, I often find myself wondering what will become of this type of student. This book has given me much more to wonder about.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I could go on, but the fact of the matter is you've heard it all before. But this album is worth the hype and more. It is seriously one of the best albums ever recorded in history. It doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to... you have to at least listen to this once. It is beatiful. If Lauryn Hill never even comes out with the follow-up studio album to this, I will still be content. I highly recommend this album. You've got $7.99 to \\"lose\\" and a whole lot of good music to gain.

The book is really nothing more than a compilation of anecdotes and testimonials by various \\"experts\\", including a \\"metaphysician\\", and a \\"life coach\\". Also thrown in for good measure, are chapters by \\"author\\" Jack Canfield, and \\"Dr.\\" Joe Vitale (marketing superstar). Each of the contributors goes on and on about how \\"The Secret\\" will give you ANYTHING you want in life. Anything. Trouble is, they give no real evidence to back up any of their claims. It was a real chore finishing this book, but I managed. In the end, I could only give it one star, and that star isn't for content--it's for the genius use of marketing that has propelled the book up the best seller lists.
B000HIVOI2|3.0|This is a good sci-fi movie and fun to watch. The blu-ray edition is quite good if you take under consideration that it is an older movie. There is a problem with the subtitles, you have to turn them on so you can read the dialogue that takes place in the ancient dialect as they stay on for english too. But overall a good movie that was transfered on blu-ray pretty well.

It is very good to hear other version of this well knonw prog rock masterpiece.

However there are not many, if any, actors today like Steve McQueen just for that and the greatest car chase in movie history this movie is worth  own it and watching it. It should be noted that at that period of time there were no computers or special effects that exist in todays movie industry and thus the car chase becames ever better.  Good plot and great acting

1582701709|1.0|I would like to know what the advocates of \\"The Secret\\" would say to the women in Darfur who are being raped?  Are these women thinking negative thoughts, so they deserve it?  And what about the child who dies of a fatal disease?   Was that child sending bad thoughts into the universe?  Maybe it's his parents' fault, for their negativity?  <br /> <br />If this book weren't so horribly insulting to people whose lives are full of suffering and sadness, it would be insipidly laughable. The only thing smart about \\"The Secret\\" is the title; what an ingenious marketing ploy!
B00005JLEU|4.0|Writing as someone who has never watched anime before, this animated feature is an incredibly imaginative superior production with an intelligent story.   <br />Chihiro is on her way with her parents to a new home - on the way they stop to explore a strange tunnel, which takes them into another world.  In this world, through gluttony, her parents are turned into pigs, and Chihiro is rescued by Haku, a young boy.  She finds work in the centrepiece of this world, the bathhouse for spirits, in which she has many adventures which gradually change her from sullen and spoiled to helpful and kind. <br />The ideas are complex, and the animation suitably layered as well.  The bathhouse creatures are weird and wonderful creations - neither heroes nor bad guys, good nor bad - just fascinating multilayered characters.  All of the main storylines involve layers of identity, nothing being what it first seems, and the animation style lends itself to this incredibly well. There is the slime monster who everyone cannot bear the smell of, who, with a little kindness reveals a more benevolent and powerful spirit.  Or the `No-face', sort of a walking `Scream' portrait, who changes his identity through loneliness, but returns once kindness and friendship are given.  And of course Haku, who takes many forms before being redeemed when reminded of his true identity. <br />Though the animation on one level may appear simplified compared to modern cgi `toons', in fact the colours and rhythm of events are richer than most, and although I am writing this after one viewing, one suspects that there is much more to be seen on multiple viewings. <br />Amongst the almost universally glowing reviews however, it is worth remembering that this is a Japanese film.  This is both an asset and a detraction.  The asset is clear - this movie has more imagination in one scene than any current animated Western feature has in its whole length, both in animation and story.  However, while Hollywood sometimes falls prey to too much schmaltz, the absence of a sweetener to the tale here means that it is difficult to be absorbed on more than an intellectual level.  Animated features work because you become passionate about the characters or the outcome - not easy when all you are doing is thinking how wonderful all the ideas are.  <br />The DVD comes in two disc form, with the first showing the film in both English dubbed (by John Lasseter of Toy Story / Pixar boss fame) and the original Japanese with subtitles.  There is also an option to watch the whole movie in its original storyboard form, but hard to imagine anyone would watch the whole movie this way - though it is fascinating to see this embryonic stage of the movie for a minute or two in places. <br />The second disc contains a range of material educating the non-Japanese and anime fans amongst us of Miyazaki's output, amongst other generally interesting bits and pieces. <br />Having said that, the tale is a complete one, the experience rich, and the moral positive.  Perhaps younger children will find this a little scary in places, and perhaps a little complicated, but it's a small quibble with so much to warrant the Oscar (Best Animated Feature, 2002) it won.  Recommended, as long as you are comfortable with something a little bit different, and prepared for not so much sugar with your dessert.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I saw this late one Christmas night on PBS back in about 1987.  I remembered the story, the music, and that David Bowie narrated it. This past season I searched for it under \\"snowman, David Bowie\\" and found it and bought it.  The film is truly magical and my 2 year old is mesmerized by it.  The music throughout is fantastic.  Highly recommended.  The only negative comment I have is that the Bowie narrative (or intro?) is gone, despite the fact that his name is mentioned in the cast.  (The spoken intro in the DVD, by someone else not identified, is good too by the way).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Other than Arrested Development, this was the most under-rated show on TV.  Never heard of this show?  It's okay, I didn't either.  But, I'm glad I picked it up.  It's remarkably fresh and the sarcasm alone makes me laugh for minutes.  Hardworking cast makes this show worth watching over and over.  Space.  Wild west.  Comedy.   There isn't a genre out there for this series.  It will be missed.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|Wow. I wasn't too impressed with Saw 1, really liked Saw 2, but LOVED Saw 3! Here's a movie that relies more on intelligence than gore. Although there is plenty of that. And some of the torture scenes are so imaginative that it's way more entertaining than gruesome. The 3 movies together make for some of the best in horror movie history.
B000JJS8TM|2.0|It would be MUCH better to republish ALL originals AS IS, but in high-res SACD.
B0002234LS|4.0|\\"Secret Window\\" is based on the Stephen King novella \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden,\\" and is one of the best King adaptations: in some ways, the film does a better job with the material than the source. The plot is similar to quite a few other King stories like \\"The Dark Half,\\" \\"Misery,\\" and even \\"The Shining.\\" Like so much of that author's work, it deals, in twisted ways, with potential dilemmas that writers (e.g., King himself) might face. Critics largely panned the film because they felt that it lacked suspense, it was derivative, etc. But that's not really the point. The film is a crisp character study of personality break-down during the dissolution of a marriage. On those terms, it succeeds brilliantly. Johnny Depp, a chameleon of an actor, once again provides the lead with astonishing style, individuality, insight, subtlety, and nuance. The rest of the cast is similarly attuned to the material: John Turturro, Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton, Len Cariou. The director/screenwriter, David Koepp, uses striking images and compelling camera movements. Those who know his \\"Stir of Echoes\\" (which I found dreary) will find this to be far more elegant and colorful, lighter and inventive. The score by Philip Glass shows us exactly what that minimalist composer *should* be doing; it's a great score. The extras are insightful and gratifying. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is gorgeous. Highly recommended.
B00003CX96|5.0|This is a favorite of ours. We already had the VHS but wanted the DVD. It is an outstanding film and ours came quickly and in great condition.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|I just finished watching The Departed on blu-ray DVD and it is one great movie. The Departed is about a cop named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who grew up in a crime filled neighborhood. He becomes an under cover cop who has been planted into Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) crime operation. It's up to Billy to win Costello's trust and help his colleagues (Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen) bring Costello down. There is an unexpected twist when officer Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) gains everyone's trust in the department. What they don't know about officer Sullivan is that he's Costello's mole. The Departed while keep you glued to your TV as you deal with all the of twists, and turns. Martin Scorsese makes a great and very entertaining movie that reminds us why we like to go to the movies in the first place. The cast is amazing and I believe this is going to win BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and/or Best Supporting Actor (Mark Wahlberg) at the Academy Awards this year. As for the blu-ray DVD the picture and sound are top notch and the bonus features are good.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, Spanish, French<br /><br />Available Audio Tracks: English (PCM), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)<br /><br />1080p high definition 16x9 2.40<br /><br />BD-50<br /><br />PCM English 5.1, Dolby Digital English 5.1, Dolby Digital French 5.1, Dolby Digital Spanish 5.1<br /><br />Special features (480i or 480p standard definition, 2.0 stereo):<br /><br />Nine additional scenes with introductions by director Martin Scorsese<br /><br />The Story of the Boston Mob: the real-life gangster behind Jack Nicholson's character<br /><br />Crossing Criminal Cultures: how Little Italy's crime and violence influence Scorsese's work<br /><br />Theatrical trailer
B000KCHZK6|2.0|couldnt get past the first five or six songs, and I LOVE Norah Jones. Kept 'fast forwarding' thinking maybe it was me. They just didnt reach. There was a kind of 'nothing special' effect. Maybe the success of the first two albums went to her head. Maybe someone so young should try singing duets with more experienced and seasoned singers, it might not be very 'original' but it would certainly take her from a very talented apprentice to maybe  being a true master. Nora you are so young, and I believe that you are a National Treasure, take your time.

B000M341QE|3.0|Upon viewing the film The Departed I was left with one impression;what was all the hype about.Now don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad movie not at all...just over-hyped.Not to draw comparisons to one of Scorcese's best movies but Goodfellas was his baby.Goodfellas was great because you want to see it again immediately after viewing it.The Departed...meh I really couldn't say i would care if I never saw it again. <br /> <br />                    It had it's moments but they were fleeting and the ending fell flat on it's face with contrivances piling up faster than a freeway carwreck.The only scene for me that showed real vision and a bit of the old Scorcese flair was the demise of one of the peripheral character's plummeting off a rooftop right in front of Billy Costigan's(Leonardo DiCaprio's character) viewpoint.Other scenes went nowhere and even one moment of self concious irony occurs when Costigan says to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson in full on eyes V'ed snarling grimace JACK mode)  \\"What the f*%& are we talking about\\".The script needed tighting up and nowhere is it more apparent than in this revelatory scene.Scenes where Nicholson pours cocaine on two (I'm assuming) prostitutes and tells them to get numb from it just seems overindulgent and pointless. <br /> <br />             So in closing was the Departed a good film? yeah! Great film? No where close.Oscar for Scorcese? I'm afraid to say it but Goodfellas was his to win.Too bad a little film called The Silence of the Lambs was released the same year(IMHO Scorcese was robbed...while TSOTL might have been the better movie..and that's a stretch...no way was Jonathan Demme's vision even on par with Scorcese's to win the Oscar).Looks like Scorcese will win the lifetime achievement award when he's old and feeble...kinda like when  they shuffled out Robert Altman a year before he croaked.Unless Scorcese can deliver something on par with his greats than it appears the man from little Italy will always be chasing theimpossible dream.This movie is not it!
B0000AYL17|5.0|This is one of the best recordings by Steely Dan. The hybrid SACD offers the remastered cd version plus the SACD 2 channels and 5.1 version. The SACD in 2 channels sounds fantastic, one of the best SACD's I own. Strangely I have had problems with the 5.1 version. In fact I have bought it twice! I don't know why in some moments my universal player has problems reading both. This is the only SACD in which I have problems. It's a pity, because the recording is fantastic. Maybe I will buy the DVD-audio, because I love this music.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|When this movie was released in the USA it was much maligned by many academics and critics who should be ashamed of themselves for some spiteful and reactionary comments.  Admittedly the cinema release was very uneven in places and on reflection should never have been released. Despite the World box office being very good and a big hit you would never realise this just  looking at the american reviews.  Whether the suits take complets blame or Ridley Scott allowed himself to be distracted, the fact remains that the extended 4 disc dvd version is a magnificent cinematic epic in the Lawrence tradition. When you see the Oscar noms, this dvd version should have walked the main prizes.  But then I am an avid admirer of (in my opinion) the greatest director on the planet.    The sheer scale of this film is hugely impressive  There is not a better cinematic director with the \\"magic eye\\" when it comes to pulling the viewer into the world without relying on exploiting multiple efx shots to do so.    It is no surprise that constant criticism of it's historical inaccuracy has damaged its reputation.  Show me a movie dealing with real historical events that hasn't factually followed the absolute truth. Unless you want a documentary even scholars can't agree on events that happened a decade ago!       As to Orlando Bloom being a weak character and unable to carry the movie.  What guff, he is not supposed to be a Maximus, Mad Max, Indiana Jones leading man and is ably supported by a very high quality cast.    Hopefully in the years to come there will be a re-evaluation of this movie and restore its rightful place as a true cinematic masterpiece.
B0002X314C|4.0|I can listen to this CD from beginning to end and not skip a song. It tells a story so you can't skip any songs. LOL my friends and i get a kick out of the humorist things he says its a good buy.
1582701709|1.0|I picked this book up on a whim at a neighbors house, thinking it would give me additional insight, instead I was absolutely infuriated. People seeking to understand the nature of suffering would be better served by looking to the ancients. Considering Rhonda Byrne culled her only genuinely helpful suggestions from them anyway, maybe it's a better idea to go to the source instead of these people who focus entirely on the too selfish American preoccupation with self-image and material wealth. It is said in every greatly positive religion and philosophy in the world that compassion and love for yourself and your fellow man is the key to true contentment and happiness. You don't need to pay someone looking to make a buck and gain fame for this knowledge. It is free.
B0000640VO|5.0|Everything in this movie is perfectly done. All the different aspects of the film come together to form a great story. I have watched this movie multiple times. In English and French, with and w/o directors commentary. Everything from costume design, music, story to directing is amazing. The director points out in the commentary what he thinks are his mistakes yet you could easily not view them as mistakes even knowing. Amazing use of color and lighting with the small touch of visual effects it truly completes the story.
B000002U82|5.0|\\"The dark side of the moon\\" is at least to my m ind the most original proposal formulated by any other band until that moment. And the main reason is the bulletproof commitment and audacious statements in what lyrics concern as well as the kaleidoscopic flight that breeds it.<br /><br />Pink Floyd not only elevated but enriched notably the conception of irreverent expression, totally distant of the commercial mainstreams, they knew to add a new language, vision and sidereal scope to the music.<br /><br />On the other hand just a few records have been able to achieve the elitesque distinction of mythical albums and this is one of them.<br /><br />An absolute masterpiece that not only established a landmark in what concerns to have kept along fifteen years at the top of the best sellers, besides signified a before and an after in the music.<br /><br />Sometimes the words are useless because are unable to express the majestic grandness of the artistic expression.
1582701709|1.0|Thinking that we control the Universe with our thoughts is prideful.  This \\"secret\\" smacks in the face of giving the glory to God for the amazing blessings in our lives.  I completely value positive thinking and many of the nice qualities that this DVD and book promote, however it seems to be taking some of God's power in our lives- out of the picture.  There may be a little Satanism in these teachings...\\"for he seeks to counterfeit all that is good.\\"  Devote your lives to becoming more like the Savior...that is the real challenge in life.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I really don't understand a couple of perspectives that are prevalent in a lot of the reviews I'm reading here:  first, there are those that say this movie isn't a true to life account of the first Gulf War.  Yet it is based a book written by a Marine who tells his account of what happened while he was there.  Granted, his experience might be an unusually aberrant and anomalous one (or maybe author Anthony Swofford is just the Marines version of James Frey), but I think it's unfair to bash the movie's lack of \\"realism\\" because it quite faithfully portrays the words found in Swofford's account.<br /><br />Second, there are those who say nothing happens in this movie (and I had read some accounts of this going into the movie, so I was prepared for periods of boredom in viewing the DVD).  That said, I was never bored throughout the entire film and couldn't for the life of me figure out what could have been meant by the phrase \\"nothing happens\\" unless people are using it to mean \\"no traditional war movie combat happens.\\"<br /><br />Because, to my eyes and ears, plenty happened (and if you don't want to be spoiled for this movie, skip this paragraph because I'm about to list those happenings): there's the grueling (if uncharacteristic) training sequences (including the shocking death at Camp Pendleton), the fake-branding initiation, the football game and its consequences, the Christmas Eve party accident with the fire (and its fallout), the near killing and suicide by Swoff, the tense and surreal desert meeting with the Bedouins, the friendly fire attack, the running through mortar blasts to get batteries, the burning of the oil fields, the meal at the Highway of Death, Fowler's finding and desecration of the corpse, the incongruity of the oil-covered horse, the sniper mission with Swoff and Troy, and the final victory celebrations (at both home and in the desert).<br /><br />Sure, there were never any full-on scenes of engaging the enemy, but enough happened that I was never restless even though the movie itself is sometimes a depiction of restlessness.<br /><br />Finally, to those who say this movie dishonors our military, I just have to say that I found one of the final scenes on the bus (I'm trying not give anything away here) to be a very poignant and more-than-symbolic illustration of the brotherhood across many military generations.<br /><br />I personally think this is very well-shot and well-acted representation of Swofford's book.  It's not meant to be a depiction of what happens in the center of Operation Desert Storm, but instead shows what takes place at the storm's fringes, where even there soldiers are at times showered upon by oil, mortar, and the fallout from their own anxiety and boredom.though the movie itself is sometimes a depiction of restlessness.

B0002DB0FO|4.0|I don't know how you think about this, but I can say that this series has a really good story. <br />A father and husband who is not home very often a day, because he works very long and doesn't see the problems which occur. He hasn't been a good father and husband. All this changed then because of a big tragedy.  <br />Andy Brown decides to move to Everwood, Colorado, because his wife told him once. His son Ephrem is in his puberty and not quit happy about the change. For his daughter Delia can Andy be the father she alway wanted and always loved.  <br />As the story progresses Andy and Ephrem go through big difficulties and are more bound together. Andy never told his son why they had to move and Ephrem never understood, but then Andy does.  <br />The death of a beloved one changes everything and this remarkable told story deals with that very good. Nothing is left out and so \\"Everwood\\", has to have a continuing part.  <br />You can't get enough when you have started to see...
B00011F5DK|5.0|We have played Blokus with two other couples.  Both those couples have also ordered the game after playing it.  It is simple yet challenging, and you need both good strategy and luck to win.  The game is best played by four people; we've played it with two, but it can get confusing since you each have to play two colors.  I recommend this game.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|I just caught The Covenant on pay per view and have to say that it was definitely worth checking out.  Sure it wasn't ground breaking but it was good enough to keep my interest the entire time.  The acting was pretty good considering that it was very much a B-type movie. Plus it didn't hurt that the movie was filed with hot guys. All in all a fun popcorn movie but what else do you really expect from a Renny Harlin movie.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|The biggest regret I have is that I will never get the time I spent watching this movie back. I'm not going to ruin anything about the movie but I will say that it is way over-rated and that you're better off watching something else!
B000K7UBTI|2.0|This is almost exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be. I could have tolerated a little tinkering with the standard origin, but what they came up with runs so contrary to what the Iron Man comic has been about that it's almost a slap in the face. For a hero and comic that's so concerned with the technological, to watch the storyline just kind of decompose into hokey mumbo jumbo while almost 44 years of history aren't just tossed to the side, but into the dirt, that's hard for me to swallow.<br /><br />The fact is, the story wasn't just different, it was BAD. The pacing was awful, and honestly, the only parts really worth watching are the battle sequences (minus the awful non-event that is the \\"Mandarin\\" face-off). I was pleased with the Ultimate Avengers movies, I thought they portrayed Iron Man well, and while they didn't really portray either Ultimate Iron Man or classic Iron Man exactly right, as the character was more or less an amalgamation of the two, he was much closer than this take on him, which basically has him with this emo-angst, I have to prove something to daddy thing. Howard should have been left DEAD.<br /><br />So to sum it up. What I thought was WRONG about Iron Man:<br /><br />1) Hokey, mumbo-jumbo filled story that ignores Tony Starks genius and reduces him to merely a reactionary shell of the comic character.<br /><br />2) Howard Stark...alive.<br /><br />3) Rhodey...a wimp (Army medic? COME ON!!!).<br /><br />4) Pepper Potts...BRITISH?!? Was that to add a touch of class?<br /><br />5) Mandarin...a GHOST?!? An emperor from some obscure Chinese Dynasty? Bleh...<br /><br />6) A dragon that ISN'T Fin Fang Foom...<br /><br />7) Iron Man using a sword (BTW, the 'prophecy' angle is tired and lame)!<br /><br />8) A final 'battle' that is a non-event. Tony's whining throughout was particularly grating...<br /><br />9) Too much time in the clunky origin armor (with all those other armors supposedly already made, including the Ultimate armor, and we get the Shellhead?).<br /><br />10) Ignoring Tony's character. Now everyone thinks if you do a few cheesy pickup lines and have him drink some booze, you've nailed him. Where is the intelligence? Where is the wit? Where are the one-liners and critical thinking from the past? He's a genius (except when it comes to women)...treat him as one.<br /><br />I'm stopping at 10...<br /><br />This movie is poor. I'll give it an extra star for the battle sequences, which are at least entertaining, but the rest is boring, almost painful in some places.

B000INAXGU|4.0|I'm not a Jamiroquai fan by any means - the only track I had purchased until now was a cd single of, 'Virtual Insanity' back in '96.<br /><br />As someone who always shied away from buying a whole Jamiroquai album this seemed a great place to start. I still don't enjoy the first five tracks (which is probably blasphemy to a 'true' fan) but what follows is shear pleasure.<br /><br />It's a mixture of funk, pop, disco and rock - if only I could dance to it as well as Jay Kay. Can't wait to get the accompanying DVD.

SONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR BY TEARS FOR FEARS. <br />This album contains their three big hits. EVERYBODY WANTS TO RULE THE <br />WORLD, SHOUT, AND HEAD OVER HEELS. Those three are the ones that made this <br />group a household name.  THE WORKING HOUR is a great song. Very emotional. <br />I also liked MOTHERS TALK and BROKEN. Both those songs are rockers. <br />I BELIEVE is a nice ballad.  LISTEN is above average. 8 songs on this <br />album, plus additional bonus songs. Among the bonus tracks, THE MAURADERS <br />is a catchy tune, the remix' of SHOUT and BROKEN are cool. THE BIG CHAIR <br />is a waste. Its just noise and a bunch of sounds. <br />     This is a great album, Very enjoyable. If you are a Tears For Fears <br />die hard fan or a new fan, buy this.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie was panned by a bunch of critics. That is, ADULT critics.<br /><br />Conversely, they were perhaps inadvertently panning themselves, because in a supreme bit of irony, they failed to understand why teens at the time responded so deeply to this movie. The very themes that the 5 kids dealt with in the movie and the lack of empathy on the critics' part underscored the gap between them and the Gen X'ers. For those of us who grew up at that time, the feelings of displacement and dysfunctional parental pressures were very, very real. All of the then-young actors do a splendid job of putting us in their situations. And not only do we feel for them, we remember. This is one of the few, rare movies of the 1980s that makes teens into real people with real dilemmas.

B00003CXRP|5.0|This riveting movie further confirms Tom Hanks' greatness as an actor. Everything he does is imbued with such honesty and truth. Furthermore, he makes every reaction to his situation seem believable. You do not get the sense of a star trip here. You are made to feel being there with him on that desert isle, terrified for him, rooting for him, and feeling his forlorn sorrow and loneliness. His effortless way of reaching out - without trying to - is often deeply moving. Hanks' enactment of the character's metamorphosis is stunningly worked out, yet uncalculating, organic. The one sly factor in Hanks' persona is his subtle, yet absolutely uproarious sense of humor: he indicates certain touches, ways of registering a situation with such deft irony you're laughing along with your tears. Few actors are more spontaneously skilled than Hanks in registering a human emotion that everyone can relate to. The greatest gift an actor can have is the ability to make the audience feel, understand and react to, the character's emotions; and only an actor who is real, and genuine and borne of an inborn simplicity of truth can really hope to reach audiences on such a universal level. Tom Hanks is undoubtedly in the elect. Perhaps no other actor today has that hallmark, Jimmy Stewart-like appeal as does Hanks. He is the Every Man actor of our time.

B00003CXDB|4.0|Wall Street is the story of young, naive stockbroker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) who is too impatient to go through the right channels to success and instead lets him impatience get him in trouble. Sick of cold calling, Bud Fox goes straight for the big fish... in this case, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) an entrepreuneur who is often written about in Fortune magazine, aka the Bible. When Bud gets involved with Gordon, before he knows it he's losing all his inhibitions, caring nothing about the consequences of his actions, and is involved in an insider trading scam that threatens to ruin his family.<br /><br />Wall Street is arguably Oliver Stone's best film, and has the solid acting, stellar film quality, and impressive use of light and sound to earn itself the title. It's even more relevant in the insider trading obsessed climate of the early 21st century, and I think its tale of backstabbing and betrayal will--sadly--always have a place in modern society. Charlie Sheen shines as a naive, impatient young buck who refuses to take the necessary time to achieve success on his own and instead is willing to cut any corners on the path to fame and fortune. Michael Douglas plays the villain perfectly, without remorse and with no qualms about who gets crushed in the process. For anyone who enjoys Oliver Stone films or impressive drama with a solid cast, I'd recommend Wall Street.
B000EULJLU|5.0|When 10,000 Days was released, via CD, Maynard says the album, \\"Requires an uninterrupted listening, it's a journey.\\"    And a journey it is.    Vicarious starts in as soon as the album is played, no `white noise'.  Vicarious' (and other tracks) concept is something I favor, and am glad to hear it made apparent in Tool's music.  Some may dislike Tool's `new political stance', but as the band has stated, it's not `new' at all.  If anyone had taken the time to look into the bands interest of Bill Hicks, they would clearly see this.  Something huge is happening in the world.  How can something of this magnitude be ignored?    To tackle current events, that affect us all, (whether we're ready to admit it or not) and to do intelligently, is something to be admired not shunned.    The CD continues wonderfully into its second track, and flows with beauty through-out.  Partnerships between tracks are apparent and because of this connection, the music is able to dig deeper into its own theme.  There's the hard, and the soft; screams and sighs, foot tapping and not, as there are in all Tool's music, and again in perfect harmony.  Concepts are high and the music breaths nicely.     Each member has brought their A game to the table, and it shows.  The album is very mature.  Listening to any of the tracks off this album one could clearly hear; four amazing musicians who have spent almost 15 years trying to perfect their craft (*minus 4 or so years on Justin's involvement.)    Evolution is evident, but don't just take my word for it; turn off your TV and listen to 10,000 Days.  It might just be a collection of the sweetest sounds to ever grace your ear drums.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Don't come to it looking to attack Gore, \\"lib-burls\\" or some other straw man. Gores arguments that the Earth is becoming warmer can be proven by simply keeping a daily record of the temperature. How much is  due to the burning of fossil fuel is an open question although, again it can be proven, that CO2 does trap heat & prevent from radiating into space. Due yourself a favor and watch it, you might learn something. No one every died from the truth, but many have died from lies

B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman's self-titled debut album is as confessional as it is striking. It's nothing innovative or new, you'll hear plenty of the songwriters of old, but you'll also hear a voice that with enough attention will captivate the listener.<br /><br />This album made her a household album and quite simply exploded. She was a sensxation all on the basis of one song \\"Fast Car\\". But Tracy's music has just so much more depth than the commentarial lyrics of \\"Fast Car\\".<br /><br />Firstly she is a superb guitarist, simple yet captivating, her style is nostalgic of Baez and Mitchell. Secondly her voice, fusing elements of Nina Simone, Joan Armatrading and Natalie Merchant, it entertains throughout.<br /><br />This was on eof the albums that kickstarted the female rock movement of the early to mid 90's. Even though Chapman doesn't try anything new, she pulls off her deliberate simplicity well. This album is more upfront and with experimentation would lose some of its allure.<br /><br />There are an array of stylistic songs on offer here evrything from the alt-country/melodic rock of \\"For My Lover\\" to the a'cappella \\"Behind The Wall\\". This is so much more than just a simple pop record.<br /><br />Her subsequent albums have failed to mtach the hype of her initial fame (save \\"New Beginning\\"), this shows an artist who is as honest as they are humbling.

B000HEWEEY|5.0|I have always loved this classic Sci-Fi movie, but I have never ssen it like this. This new re-mastered transer has brighter scenes, better color, MUCH better sound, and a really cool Robby included. If you liked Forbidden Planet, you should see this version.
B00005JPE7|5.0|From the first Rocky to the last in Rocky Balboa these movies will always touch hearts and inspire people who are against any odds that anything is possible.  Sylvester Stallion continued his journey and provided fans with another great movie, Rocky Balboa.  Rocky Balboa is as heart pounding and magnificently done as the first 5.  I still get goose bumps when I hear the music hit during his training.  Rocky Balboa is a powerful \\"10\\".  Flash backs of Mickey and Apollo would have been great to see in the movie, especially during the training and fight, but the movie was still a hit without them.  I believe the flashbacks with Adrian were touching and sad, and caught the fans with the love that lied between Rocky and Adrian.  As a huge fan of the Rocky saga, Thank You Sylvester for the great movies and memories.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This is fantastic.  Kind of depressing, but at times also kind of inspiring...or just plain hilarious (I'm thinking of the hidden track).  The lyrics and melodies are beautiful, and the songs are different enough from each other that you can't get bored.  Definitely a good thing.  All in all, this CD is just...beautiful.  Amazing.  Whether or not you're really into very hardcore music, you're bound to like it.

B000096IBI|5.0|Modern Times is among the Best 100 American movies of all time (#81), and it is among the Best 1000 Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. I rate this movie 5 stars or 9 over 10. This movie is timeless, a masterpiece, a pleasure to watch and watch over and over again. It was the last silent movie Chaplin did and the last to feature the Little Tramp (beautiful ending with the two lovers walking arm and arm into a sunset.) The theme of the movie is how technology alienates the human being. Accidentally converted into a working class hero, Chaplin spends some time in jail, where he'd like to stay forever. There we watch one of the funniest scenes of the movie, the lunch with some \\"white powder\\". I couldn't stop laughing! In the times of the Great Depression, Chaplin portraits the unemployed and the hunger. Trying to find a steady job, he ends up in a Caffe where he waits on tables and sings. Yes! He does. The nonsense song (with Chaplin original voice in there) stands as one of the best moments in movie history. I can't quit this song off of my mind ... Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, appears here in what's considered her best and liveliest leading lady. This DVD is beautifully repackaged for the Chaplin Collection (a wonderful collection, thanks Warner!) It includes an all-new digital transfer and a soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 as well as original mono. The second DVD comes full loaded with many speacial features, like a documentary about \\"Chaplin today\\", deleted scenes, an introduction by Chaplin biographer David Robinson, a Karaoke of the nonsense song, the wonderful song Smile, sung by Liberace, a Behind the Scenes in the Machine Age 42 minutes documentary, and lots of more extras!<br /><br />I recommend this DVD to everybody, you will not be disapointed, and I would say it's a MUST for movie collectors. A classic, a masterpiece, a timeless movie!<br /><br />P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to. I modestly write them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing themwrite them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing them

0393327655|4.0|This is a very readable, a very passionate and also, in the end, a very strange book.  It begins as a blistering assault on the idiocy of religious faith, expressed with  a burning conviction that makes Richard Dawkins look positively agnostic.  It then turns into a very interesting but, perhaps to the philosophically untrained, heavy going speculation on the possibility of finding an objective non-religious foundation for morality and for any knowledge of the world at all, and rather too abruptly concludes on the basis of the linguistic pragmatism theories of Rorty and Habermas that we can't, at least not through reason and language.  Instead, ultimate truths about the world can only be communicated directly via eastern style meditation (and one suspects, at least for Harris, some marijuana and some Californian sun).  This, as a previous reviewer noted, does seem to be rather at odds with all that has gone before.  Mystical experiences arrived at through solitary meditation may be wholesome substitutes for the religious highs others obtain through the dangerous (according to Harris) communal rites of organised religion, but would appear to constitute a thin basis for a fully worked out moral system that could supplant the word of Moses or Mohammed. Or, for that matter, the linguistic limitations of Kant or Mill.  But if Harris is saying that the insights of mysticism can in fact provide a substantive moral code, and it appears that he is, then why are these non-evidence based intuitions any better, or any different, to the revealed truths of religion?<br /><br />Despite the apparent absurdity of the final argument, the book is thoroughly engaging, and even in those last chapters Harris is saying something both intelligent and interesting, he just doesn't quite articulate the difference between mysticism and religion sharply enough.  And this is a pity, as on the whole, the writing of this book is as sharp as the message is important.
B0009YKWAK|3.0|The cast of The Interpreter obviously saves this movie. Although the plot is intelligent enough, no way this movie would have been an outstanding success without the acting capabilities of Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman!  After Interpreter Kidman overhears some information she shouldn't have the rising tension is being displayed very well. However there is a very remarkable fact in this movie, that doesn't make any sense. Why isn't Kidman's part played by a black actress? Having white Kidman speak a native African language like this Ku is absolutely ridiculous! What was going through Sydney Pollack's mind when he had Nicole Kidman say lines like: \\"I'm going back to my people in Africa!\\"? (SARR)
B000JLTRJ0|2.0|The story line is a good one if you are into the 9/11 thing.  But the movie just plain stunk.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|This is an excellent movie eventhough the story does have its dull minutes. The intriging plot and the different personalities of the film characters keep you focused from the beginning. Along with the great mix the director made of both Africa's beauty and cruelty, this movie was worth the 2 hours of attention, which is a very rare thing these days in the first place. Especially for a non-action movie! When human right activist Rachel Weisz finds out about a dark secret in the pharmaceutical industry in Africa, she pays the highest price for that. When her husband Ralph Fiennes starts investigating her death, he starts to discover some things about his wife he had never known. This movie gives you a way better idea of Africa than silly stuff like Beyond borders, Sahara and Indiana Jones. (SARR)    <br /> <br />

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I am certainly not an authority on the James Bond movie series, but have read most of Ian Flemings books. Casino Royale was written 53 years ago and is still one of the best spy mysteries I have ever read. The movie is about as faithful to a book as I have ever seen. Of course the cold war is replaced by terroists, other than that it was amazing to watch Ian Flemings first book literally come to life.
0920668372|1.0|I bought this book after I gave birth to my first child, a son. The cover and the title of the book caught my eye. When I brought it home and read it, I immediately got a creeped out feeling. First I thought that it was going to be funny because the mother was still rocking her teenage son. Then I realized that it wasn't going in a funny direction. When I saw the adult son rocking his mother in a rocking chair, after finding out she was sick, it made me sad and freaked me out. <br /> <br />I am not sure how this book won so many awards. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone.
B000001GQD|3.0|Previous reviews extoll the virtues of Richter's performance, and indeed it is magnificent.  Unfortunately, the remastering of this recording did not produce a quality result.  The dynamics are poor, resulting in fuzzy strings, and horns and a less than vibrant sound from Richter's piano.  There is no sense of \\"presence\\".  This is a valuable recording for those with two or more copies of the Rach 2, who want this one as a historic performance or for collectors of Richter.  If this is your first copy and you have a decent sound system, steer clear.

B000I0QL82|3.0|This reproduction of the original movie loses quite a bit due to sound quality.  I had to continually turn up the sound and then turn it down again a few minutes later.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Somehow I missed Casino when it was first released but became interested when one of the magazines I read gave this edition a very high recommendation. So I bought it, watched it, and came away with a worse opinion of the gambling industry than I had before I saw it. <br />Casino literally drips with sleaze and gratuitous brutality. All the lead characters are excellent in their respective roles: Robert DeNiro as smooth operator Ace Rothstein, Joe Pesci as a maniacally brutal mob enforcer Nicky Santoro, and Sharon Stone as the beautiful yet conniving and drug-addled whore who marries Rothstein for money, but also continues her relationship with a lowlife boyfriend and begins one with Santoro. The combination of the instability brought on by Stone's and Santoro's drug use, Stone's cheating, and Santoro's reign of terror on the streets that attracts the feds ends by bringing everyone down and leads to countless spectacularly brutal murders. Of course, it didn't help that the relatively clean Rothstein refused to play ball with corrupt local officials. <br />There is a note on-screen at the beginning which says that the movie is based on a true story. Then there is another at the end which says all events and characters are fictional. That's hard to swallow. A friend who is a long-time resident of Las Vegas says that there is so much truth in the movie that it almost could be termed a documentary. <br />The film itself deserves five stars, I have yet to watch the extras. BUT, I subtract one star from the rating due to the advertising for other films and TV shows that precedes the showing of the film. Tacking on advertising is a practice I despise, and Casino is the only one of many films I own where this has occurred. But once you get past the ads, you are in for a long treat. Be sure to set aside ample time for viewing.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|Coming from one who can only fall asleep to horror films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre is my sleep-aid), I have to say I like this film. Most of all, I love the scenery. I truly appreciate the sets. The movie keeps me awake (which for a horror film is rare) long enough to enjoy the work they must've put into it. Very few films spark my interest in such a way. The plot line is relatively thin, the actors do their best, but the scenery (for me, anyway) was worth it.
B00092ZAO0|5.0|tThis is the first complete Ring I ever saw, and I remember that it bowled me over.  I was completely captivated then, and I remain captivated today.  I'm aware of the growing number of handsome productions of this Opera and others of the Ring, but this is the most comprehensive, in my mind, and the most effective whether or not one cares for the costuming or the sets.  After all, in producing any opera the production staff makes choices about well, drag, and how much of it the singer/actors will stagger about with on stage.  Costume is a secondary consideration, like decors.  Let's face it, a too elaborate costume can smother characterization.  I've seen the portfolio of the original designs for the first production, and they were indeed amazing, and would be equally amazing and beautiful today, if anybody cared to mount the opera that way.  But, having grown up in a generation that hooted and slighted what little we knew of German and certainly Wagnerian opera -- reacting to film clips of Melchior and Flagstadt -- I can appreciate the choice made here by Boulez-Chereau and Wagner.<br /><br />Originally, people grew up with and were accustomed to the sight of well-fed and sometiems beared singers in stage armor waving their arms before painted canvas scenery, while standing on paper-mache mountain tops.  The technology of Theatre was far simpler then.  World War II changed all that, and probably because the Wagners and Germany at large, faced a wall of hatred and resentment, as well as the palpable slur of anti-semitism, the original visual concept was radically altered.  Immediately fter the war the characters were dressed in simple, almost architectural robes and nearly naked sets were flooded with dramatic, colored lighting.  The Helen Traubel - Astrid Varnay years.  Everything abstract.  Nothing historical.  Nothing to offend anybody.  (Hopefully the Wagners stored all the original sets and costumes somewhere; we'd all enjoy to see them again.)  And then, whenthe time came to stage the Ring afresh, they gave it to the present team.  Their artistic decision was radical; it was rather a neo-socialist concept: they decided to concentrate on the meaning of the music/drama, not the pageantry, intending to make it comprehensible to the widest number of people world-over.  It was a revolutionary concept, and they succeeded in spite of initial outrage.<br /><br />In Boulez, Bayreuth found one of the world's best conductors with excellent credentials in Romantic and Modern German music.  His one remarkable trait is that he is able to remove himself from the music, and to offer to the public, music as the composer might have first experienced it; music as thought.  No podium glamor boy, Bulez shared that characteristic with Fritz Reiner, who was also able to remove all traces of the effort to produce the music expertly, and to present the sound with unexpected spontaneity and freshness.  The score of The Ring is so formidable, so daunting -- it is after all, one great operatic masterpiece -- that it is a testament to Boulez' intellectual and artistic grasp that he is able to capture and present the totality of the enterprise with orchestral balance and color; without any straining for effect or any vulgarity.  The entire production, the direction, the singers and stage effects, all elements rest securely on Boulez' firm orchestral control.<br /><br />The show begins, as Anna Russel exclaimed and my libretto says, IN the Rhine River.  IN IT!  Rather than resort as Wagner did, to fat sopranos in mermaid outfits being wheeled about on gurneys, pretending to swim behind a green scrim, Chereau chose to focus on the meaning of the river itself. It is, and has been for centuries, a great commercial waterway, originating in Switzerland and proceeding north through Germany, to form that delta land that is now Holland, and then to empty into the North Sea.  Transport=Commerce=Power.<br /><br />Instantly, as the curtain rises, we are confronted with the spillway of what looks like a hydro-electric dam. Night.  There's a thin metal catwalk above this construction, and a woman in a long sparkling dress like an evening gown appears.  She stretches and begins to sing.  She is the first of the three Rhine Maidens, and it is to these eminently atractive females that Alberecht, the first male on stage, is drawn.  In the original he's described as a Gnome.  This production strips that conceit away and presents him as a man of the people; a rather crudely dressed individual; a drifter, a casual working man, a poor and lonely man, and not a very attractive one.  But he is a man who is attracted to pretty, flirting women.  And the show beneath Wagner's original metaphor becomes something we've all seen in big cities; lonely, unskilled men trying to mate with wanton women unded the bridges, aqueducts and train tressels of commercial big-city reality.  It's love among the homeless.<br /><br />This is one of the most effective scenes in RHINEGOLD, not only because it is well sung by all four participants, and acted well too, but because of the exceptional acting of Hermann Becht.  What a peformance, noble in its pathos!  Anyway, the sluts tease Alberecht unmecifully, humiliate and torment him, but won't have him.  The reason?  They do give him a glimpse of the Rhine's gold -- money is gold and a girl's got to work -- and it's meaning sticks in his mind.  He's gold-struck.  They can't stop him from stealing it.<br /><br />next, dawn.  Now, we meet the Family; Wotan, Sky god, his wife, Goddess Frica, and their two companions -- bully boys of Wotan's -- Donner (Lightening) and Froh (Thunder.)  In the original they're all sleeping in the grass like vagrants in a public park, until Frica wakes, rises and looks about.  On the other side of the valley she sees something that disturbs and amazes her.  In this production Frica, acted by Hanna Schwartz, wears a 19th century dress, and hair-style, and looks not unlike any high-class lady of he period, but reminds one of Cosima Wagner.  It's a wonderful portrayal, all violet cologne, and one by one after Wogan wakes, the actors assume their roles and fall into an ensemble so convincing, one cannot help but focus on their situation and wonder how they're going to deal with it.  We almost forget they're singing, the acting's that good.  Donald McIntye is flawless; a brilliant characterization.  It reminds you, if you need it, how good they all are.  Some say he looks like Wagner.  Maybe.  But you are forced to keep your eyes on Martin Egel.  He's incredible: a lesson on how to keep your character important even when you don't have many lines.<br /><br />What Fricka's looking at is a kind of castle that appears to have grown up overnight in god-time.  Wotan says he dreampt it into existence, and is delighted to see it.  The trouble is, he doesn't know how to pay for it.  Fricka is happy too because she says that now he has a proper home, Wotan won't go tomcatting around the world anymore.  The trouble is, Wotan's promised to pay for the labor of the Giants by giving them Fricka's sister Fria, goddess of youth and beauty.  (Beautiful Carmen Reppel plays the role here, in a dress that has to be seen.  And she can sing as good as she looks.)  She runs onstage screaming bloody murder because she can't stand the Giants.  Then the giants appear in wonderful costumes, like Medieval festival figures.  Big basso voices.  Great singing, all 'round, and by now you're so used to the 19th century convention of dress, and architectural detail, you've accepted it and are caught in the story.  The costuming has actually helped us to focus the motivations of the characters.<br /><br />Fed up, the Giants take Fria away with them and, strangely, one is affected in spite of oneself.  The visuals are incredible.  But, the Gods begin to age; they weaken.  With his last gasp, Wotan calls for his handler, his point man, the ultimate schyster, Loge; Fire.  Frica thinks him declassee -- he's not a god, after all, only an elemental force -- but intelligence is his primary attribute, and after some sly reasoning, Loge comes up with a solution.  Now, somebody might think this is Loge's opera because Heinz Zednik in this role surpasses all expectations.  Is he the best actor of them all?  He sings like a dream, but his acting is a wonder; so detailed.  Hypnotic.  He tells Wotan to go to the Nibelungens deep in the earth, and steal the gold Alberecht stole from the Rhine Maidens.  And they go.<br /><br />In the scenic vernacular down there proves to be down a mine.  The miners are the Niebelungen dwarves; stunted and scurring about like moles in goggles and helmets.  The adventure is something like an English Hammer Films horror show, but with Loge's help, Wotan bamboozles Alberecht, captures him, takes the gold and steals the ring of power from him.  He relinquishes it with a terrible curse, but what else can he do?  Alberecht is the hero here, not Wotan.<br /><br />When Wotan and Loge return to the surface of the earth -- which looks like the patio of an industrial park -- they pile up the gold.  The Giants return Fria, but quarrel with Wotan about her, and money and everything else.  Eventually they get all the gold and even the ring Wotan stole.  Wotan is as angry in his way as Alberecht was in his.  But, fighting about details, one of the giants, Fafner, kills Fasolt.  But hey, says Loge!  You've got Walhalla.  Top of the line.  You have got to see Zednik the hunchback, dancing about in Fria's veil: the highest camp; the most sordid comedy.  He is their facilitator and they all hate him, as do we, because he does not pretend, but speaks truthfully.  However,  all ends well as all must that's based on lying, swindling, theft and murder, and as Egel opens his golden mouth to summon the clouds, they arrive and Wotan drags his godhead off, hands linked, over a rainbow bridge, to inhabit as grandiose a Post-Modern schloss as Wagnerin his time, could have imagined.  And that's it.<br /><br />If your libretto is like mine, the english translation of the text is so literal you'd think German was a language for apes.  Terrible.  A great disservice.  You'll either have to make your own translation or find a good paraphrase, because once you do, you'll find that the language is as easy as English to understand.  German is similiar enough that you'll actually come to think you're hearing the show in English, after a while.  The director has worked with the actors so well that the differences vanish.  You can understand the story simply by watchng it and depending on the orchestral schore.  It's clear as crystal. And this is just the beginning; the prelude!<br /><br />One last note: watch Hanna Schwartz carefully.  Her Fricka is so life-like; on the surface all graciousness and elegance, but underneath a scheming, manipulative canine.  (Remember Susan Hayward?) Schwartz has learned to a good degree, that skill some German singers have of being able to sing without looking as though they were.  Schwartzkopf had it to perfection.  I saw her last Marchelin at the Met, and she sang it as though she were merely having a chat.  The sound was there.  That wonderful voice was there, but no facial distortion.  The body was held in check by her technique.  Now, everybody can't do that, but this production shows fairly well, how it should be done; and though there are many good german-singing performers, and a few now as good as those in this cast of twenty years ago, at this high professional level, what's to quarrel about?  For a viewer new to the Wagnerian canon, this presentation is an ideal way to experience the entirety of the drama.  It familiarizes one easily with the characters, and makes subsequent viewings of this material familiar and more accessible.  You will enjoy other productions more because of this one.
B00006JDVV|5.0|I learned to appreciate the acting abilities of Gerard Butler and Christian Bale. The graphics were great.
6305511055|5.0|An excellent movie helped to a great extent by the young Robert Redford.  Have seen it many times and will watch it many more.
B0000AFX64|3.0|I grew up watching such shows as BSG , BuckRodgers and movies like Star wars. I was so excited to find out that their had been a Bigscreen motion picture made way back when of BSG. I was stunned to find out it was never coming to the USA. I was even more disappointed to watch and realize it was like the first 4 or so episodes tied together. I had actually believed it was seperate from the origional series. But that being said, I am glad I bought it.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Top Notch. I saw this movie in 1956 and it was a sensation. This release explains why and it is a great rendition/restoration. Recommended.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|Think of the yin and yang concept to help understand this record.  Light vs dark, incline vs decline, active vs passive, and so on, but it's done in a minimalistic yet methodical way in which all components come together naturally.  Very atmospheric and beautiful.  My tastes typically include TOOL, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, Talk Talk, etc.. and this somehow fits in nicely with such intellectual music.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Probably the best Sci-fi spoof ever. If you like the original star trek it's a must. Really funny to watch no matter how often I watch it.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|What a great surpise the movie AND the music is. In addition to the genuine on-screen chemistry (a very refreshing change from so many movies) between Hugh and Drew and a funny, feel-good story, Hugh and Haley belong in the top 10 with the title song... This is one of the rare film soundtracks I've bought; the other songs are also infectious... Very impressive!
0743270754|5.0|As the cliche goes (but is so often dead wrong), this is one hitorical book that truly reads like a novel. Ms. Goodwin's writing style is exceptional. The book is riveting. Particulatly enjoyable and unique is the way Ms. Goodwin looks at the pivitol events of the time not only through the eyes of the President, but also through his chief advisors, once his chief adversaries. Now, one can only dream of the type of inclusion and spirit of cooperation between political rivals that existed in Mr. Lincoln's cabinet. The President was masterful in the unique way he used these political diffences to strengthen his branch of government. Ms. Goodwin also has a very thorough and interesting examination of Mr. Lincoln's well known battles with meloncholy or depression. Reading this book, one must be struck how far we have politically devolved in how we choose our political leaders. Now we choose our leaders based almost completely on image. So many display a staggering sameness, and so many are completely devoid of courage and original thought.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is the perfect Valentine's Day film or date movie that has magic, mystery, scandal and romance.  Set in beautiful turn of the century Vienna, this is the story of two young lovers of completely different social standing who meet again after 15 years.  Jessica Biel beautifully plays a duchess betrothed to marry the heir to the Austrian Empire (Rufus Sewell), a cruel man with grand ambition to be emperor and sees Eisenheim the Magician, wonderfully and charmingly played by Edward Norton, as a threat to his authority. Paul Giamatti plays Chief Inspector Uhl who is employed by the Crown Prince to arrest Eisenheim for Fraud.  Uhl is our vehicle in the story who leads us through the mystery behind the scandalous love triangle and the fantastic tricks Eisenheim produces that both fascinates and confounds the plot even further.  In the end, it was worth the journey.<br /><br />Phillip Glass's simple score repeats throughout the movie, enhancing the enigmatic and romantic quality of the film.  This is a must see by all.
B00005QK5X|4.0|every year brings not only great new music to the ears, but also great music that was somehow missed when first released. this set of 3 albums recorded between 1980 and 1982 (with plenty of bonus tracks thrown in) is a fantastic batch of punk/post-punk recordings. greg sage is such a talented guitarist i can't believe he flew under my radar for so long. quite a find, this. while i would not rate it quite as highly as i do husker du, it is pretty close; and i would say that all fans of husker du should have this. after 1st hearing this, i purchased a couple of other wipers cds and a solo greg sage effort, as well. everything is excellent. i highly recommend this to punk rockers, post-punk rockers, and all fans of rock and roll in general.
B000GFLE1S|4.0|Fun little film about a Northampton England shoemaker's son who figures out a unique way to save his father's shoe factory from being shut down.  Solution, as one employee suggested:  change the product.  And so he does.  With a little a help and inspiration from Lola, a Soho drag queen, a humble shoe factory of three generations finds a market in kinky men's footwear.
B000J10ERO|2.0|OK, so I finally saw \\"Superman Returns\\". I am confused. And to judge by online reviews, both professional and amateur, people's reactions to it are as mixed as my feelings. It was sometimes visually amazing, but generally... wasn't pretty lame? <br /> <br />One thing that irritated me, beyond \\"plot\\" points, was how the film makers seemed to have set it as their main goal, way above telling a good story, to make every single shot in the film to be IMPRESSIVE, even when it would not help the story in any way to have a shot be impressive. <br /> <br />Why did the autistic kid not save himself and his parents after he'd proven he has superpowers? How does Luthor figure he has advanced alien technology when the only thing it has proven so far to produced is spiky landfill? Why is Superman a Peeping Tom and somebody who enters people's homes uninvited? Why did Superman go from coma to full power spontaneously without any explanation? How could he lift a whole island with lots of kryptonite in it when earlier a little bit of the stuff reduced him to a rag doll? And so on and so forth.
0743270754|5.0|Excellent book.  Excellent research.  Excellent writing.   <br /> <br />Spoiler alert: Lincoln gets it in the end!
1582701709|5.0|Wow!!! What an amazing way of thinking to put the control of your life back into your own hands. You attract into your life what you put out! Now you can have the life you have always dreamed of! Great book & great movie!
B000CNFC76|4.0|If you liked Seabiscuit, this movie will appeal to you.  Actors did a great job, bringing Mark Frost's book to the screen.  I highly recommend reading the book!!!! Would get 5 stars if it were shot on location in Brookline, MA
0679721037|5.0|Journalist John Hersey (1914-1993) wrote this book through interviews with six surviving Japanese civilians only months after the bomb was dropped in August of 1945.  His highly readable prose is both unforgettable and compelling.  Hersey arrived in Japan and wrote this narrative shortly after the war ended, before we realized the frightful cancers and birth deformities that resulted from high exposure to radiation.  But we do see the horrific suffering and confusion of those who were there, some blinded, others badly burned, many with their skin peeling off in their hands. This compelling book is not for the faint-of-heart, but it illustrates the affects of the bomb on those who were there.  <br /> <br />Some readers correctly point out that Japan's army had raped and murdered its way through Asia, and that the bomb may have ultimately shortened the war and saved lives by forestalling a U.S. invasion of Japan's home islands.  Still, this is a frightful and moving account seen through the eyes of those who suffered the most.
B00009V93Z|3.0|This set is along the same lines as the \\"Today, Tomorrow, and Forever\\" box set; collect a bunch of previously unreleased studio outtakes and live performances and put them out.  While I thought \\"Today, Tomorrow, and Forever\\" was a worthwhile project, this one borders on being superfluous.  I enjoyed the alternate takes of \\"I Beg of You\\" and \\"Treat Me Nice\\".  I thought the most entertaining CD was the second one with the alternate takes from the GI Blues movie soundtrack, but I found the number of false starts in this set annoying.  The live performance on the last CD is good, but not remarkable (otherwise it would have been released before).<br /><br />There are a few tracks in this set that are interesting, but I am not sure it is enough to justify a box set.  This is for hardcore Elvis fans only, even then if you have \\"Today, Tomorrow, and Forever\\" I'm not sure that this set really adds anything to your collection.
B000000HTK|5.0|With the newly digitally remastered reissues of the VDGG catalog, you cannot possibly go wrong.  I believe Hammill & Co. have done THE best remastering job I have ever heard.  The volume, bottom end, seperation & meticulous details are all there in stunning display.  The first thing I noticed was how bright & crisp Evans' snare drum is compared to the dull thud of the previous release.  The new treatment really brought out the intricacies of his playing.  If you needed proof that VDGG had some major balls (and I myself needed this proof previously), look no further than the new Godbluff reissue - all dressed up and ready to devastate the universe.    If you are already familiar with this album, it need not be said.  Godbluff was VDGG's first comeback that shook the world during a period when Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd and the like were all but sleepwalking. Had Godbluff been released a year or 2 later, it simply would've grabbed the threat of Punk by its ear and sent it home crying to mommy.  This album had the balls no other prog band ever had, and it is my personal favorite.         \\"The Undercover Man\\" reminds me of \\"Pilgrims\\" from Still Life, with a similar pace and sets the mood for the album.  With a dramatic fade-in, \\"Scorched Earth\\" all but incinerates the place.  The aforementioned snare drum of Guy's sounding tight & crisp.  Hammill puts on an absolute demonic performance and is more than convincing.  Both Banton & Jackson sound so full on this album (and Still Life) that you wouldn't really have much room for a guitar, although Hammill's Strat is mixed very carefully in \\"Scorched Earth\\" and raises Holy Hell at the end.  \\"Arrow\\" offers a harrowing performance by Hammill, who is putting his vocal cords to the absolute test.  Finally, the trigonometry of \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" closes the album and builds to up to a climax that is to die for.  In this reissue, you can clearly hear Hammill going into a frenzy before he screams \\"Tonight before you lay down...\\".  It makes my hair stand on end everytime I hear it.  I love how Hammill refuses to play it safe, squeezing in syllables where they may or may not belong, and just completely going insane.    To me, it is important to note that Hammill doesn't sing but PERFORMS his lyrics, which I think confounds the unsuspecting listener.  It sounds lame to me to hear people [...] about his vocals, but yet offer other vocalists their highest regards for phoned-in performances of technical mastery & sterility.  BORING!!  That's like bitching about Hendrix being too loud & using feedback during his solos.  Stay home & knit a quilt!!     I could go on & on about this album and this band, but I have no time.  Of course, I highly recommend this one and any from the newly remastered VDGG catalog.  I also recommend you play it to maximum volume, because you can finally hear what VDGG was supposed to truly sound like all along.  They are the Godzilla of Progressive Rock.  VDGG never was for the faint of heart.
0316172324|4.0|This should really be titled \\"Blink for People in Areas of Their Expertise.\\"  Gladwell points out that we should often trust our gut instincts more than we normally do.  Fine.  But he also points out plenty of instances when we should not.  For example, he notes that we are more likely to sue doctors who are not nice, rather than those who screw up in diagnoses or operations.  That's not an example of strong blink instincts.  However, he notes that people who have LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN A FIELD SHOULD TRUST THEIR INSTINCTS.  Now that makes sense to me and my big gut! <br /> <br />Also interesting: a story of a military guy who challenged his bosses in practice wars.  The US military should have listened to this guy BEFORE Iraq.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This is truly one of the classics in my collection! I still remember the chills I felt when I initially listened to it - Lauryn Hill is one of a few female artists who can truly sing & rap well.  I knew about her skills from listening to The Fugees but she really blew me away with this release because honestly, at the time of the release my interest in hip hop/rap was waning.<br /><br />I had heard all of the hype surrounding the album but didn't buy it until EX-FACTOR was released as a single - I was curious like most and wondered whether the album truly deserved all of the Grammies and attention but after one listen, my answer is a resounding YES!  When an artists produces a disc that people from all walks of life, interests and music tastes can appreciate then they have done something special and that's what TMOLH did.<br /><br />The commentary of the album touches on love, ill-fated love, the music industry and a bit of religion but at no time did I feel I was being preached to or told how to feel or think  - she espoused her beliefs and offered a glimpse into her heart which in turn touched my heart on more than a few tracks. I also loved the school house interludes which seamlessly moved the tracks along - whereas some album interludes are intrusive and create bloat in albums, these worked with the tracks and served as semi-introductions.<br /><br />I love this entire album but to this day, the tracks that really touch my heart are:<br /><br />EX-FACTOR - heartbreakingly brilliant break up song; Lauryn's vocals are exquisite on this track<br /><br />TO ZION - beautiful track expressing her love for her son and the personal decision to have him during the height of her young career<br /><br />DOO WOP (THAT THING) - mixes great social commentary on male/female relationships over a great beat<br /><br />WHEN IT HURTS SO BAD - moody tale about unrequited love, I loved the harps used in the musical production & the real pain in her voice<br /><br />I USED TO LOVE HIM - loved the pairing of her & Mary J Blige's vocals, they sound beautiful together<br /><br />NOTHING EVEN MATTERS - beautiful duet ballad with D'Angelo<br /><br />THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL - her voice sounds so beautiful on this track<br /><br />It's never too late to add this classic to your collection - I'd highly recommend it!> <br />I USED TO LOVE HIM - loved the pairing of her & Mary J Blige's vocals, they sound beautiful together <br />  <br />NOTHING EVEN MATTERS - beautiful duet ballad with D'Angelo    <br /> <br />THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL - her voice sounds so beautiful on this track  <br /> <br />It's never too late to add this classic to your collection - I'd highly recommend it!
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Next to Toby Tyler, this is Disney's most beloved circus movie. And why shouldn't it be? It's also one his most tearful animated tearjerkers. \\"Baby Mine\\" is without a doubt a nerve strainer. It sounds like a lullabye, while giving joy to the small loved one in your grasp. That particular song sets the mood for the rest of the movie, and who Dumbo, the elephant . . . is. A somewhat orphan who lost his mother to not death, but punishment, banishment, and also captivity.<br /><br />This is Dumbo's time to shine, and find the talents he knows not that he has. With the help of his little mouse friend who becomes his circus coach and manager, they pull Dumbo out of obscurity and into the big top limelight. Dumbo finds the wonderous elephant he can be, and always was. Thereby, giving his family profile a much better name!
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This movie is awesome. I watched it, and I felt very touched by the story line. Don't give up on your dreams, and you can make them happen.  <br />Besides that, Channing Tatum is a MAJOR hottie! Him and Jenna Dewan make the cutest couple! Their on-screen chemistry is ah-mazing. This movie is pretty much the best movie on Earth! I love it!
B000NHQLPS|5.0|buy this at BEST BUY where it's only 25 bucks. it looks great, though. very nice design for a dvd case but i just wish it came with the script, but oh well.
B000000HTO|5.0|I am very pleased that Hammill & Co. finally have been given the support to restore & enhance their catalog.  It was well overdue for such a unique & sorely overlooked band.  I found this particular disc to really sound ballsy with the new treatment.  Those who may feel this CD lacks bottom end must be referring to the Caroline print, because this new reissue is all bottom end (if you don't believe me, crank \\"La Rossa\\" to the high heavens).  My Caroline prints of the VDGG catalog are pitiful.  This new release has no analog hiss and the mix is powerful & wonderfully seperated.  Hammill's voice cuts through the din like butter, Evan's snare drum is crisp and exact, while Banton & Jackson never sounded fuller. <br /> <br />Obviously, my review is more concentrated on the massive improvement of sound quality over previous releases from this band's catalog.  It is, in fact, the greatest improvement I've ever heard from a band, and a stunning display of how powerful & age-defying VDGG's music is and continues to be.  When I finally saw their catalog on the shelves again, I just had to find out - and I found out! <br /> <br />Still Life as an album is a masterful recording with a marked contrast in dynamics.  \\"Pilgrims\\" is a solid opener & works at a steady pace.  The track easily succeeds in setting the mood & is superbly executed.  \\"Still Life\\" is a wonderful song begging the question of validity & meaning in an eternal life.  Hammill's lyrics are, as always, way above par.  It should be noted that Hammill doesn't sing but PERFORMS his lyrics, which I believe confounds the unsuspecting listener.  This albums has a million lyrics & it amazes me that Hammill can even remember them all.  \\"La Rossa\\" is the album's centerpiece, and rocks like a bastard.  I truly love this track and often loop it on the way to work.  With this newly remastered version, I find it essential to play it (and all the others in the VDGG catalog) as loud as my car stereo can go, because the overalldynamics of this album are all the more stunning at excessive volumes.  \\"My Room (Waiting For Wonderland)\\" is proof that Hammill is indeed a great & passionate singer, who can even nail the tune's harmonic minor scale.  Jackson plays with exceptional beauty and the song has a nice peaceful drift to it.  The final track \\"Childlike Faith In Childhood's End\\" embodies the traits of the whole album and is like a compact version of the whole collection of songs.  This song has more lyrics than Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" and could be considered self-indulgent, but does nothing to diminish the song's impact.  It is highly dramatic and wonderfully performed. <br /> <br />Even though VDGG may be an aquired taste, if you like 'em, you'll love 'em.  To me, they are the cream of the progressive crop.  Of course, you should go buy this with the rest of their catalog.  Be sure, however, that it is the newly remastered versions from 2005, or you might be disappointed.
1582701709|1.0|Give me a break.... <br /> <br />I watched the Opera Windbag episode on February 16th, they were doing a re-cap of the previous so and a woman in the audience stated that she is trying to lose weight. One of the founders of this cult, yes cult, maybe one step above Scientology, stated ond of there belief's is 'you do not try, you do or do not'. Since when did a church start using Star Wars as a reference to life. Shoot, I have been a member of the Jedi church for years....
B00009QG73|5.0|Very nice concert video. Good sound-quality, colorful and nice video-pictures. One of my favourite music DVD's.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I honestly don't know if Hollywood has ever actually REALLY tried in capturing the essence of this children's story. I have seen so many productions on television, and Turner classic movies it's enough to drive you \\"Mad!\\" They are fun, \\"curious\\", and frolic, but it literally goes out the window. (Or down the rabbit hole).<br /><br />Alas, Disney has yet again come to the ultimate rescue for the children's book story lovers in us all. After I've finished reading the original book of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland, and Through The Looking-Glass, I am always drawn to constant re-watching of this animated version.<br /><br />I admit, I am a Disney fan to begin with, and \\"wonder\\" just how picky am I, since most of his animations seem to please me.<br /><br />Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is no exception, and I love the storybook look of it on the silver screen, or television. I like all the zaniness, the madcap humor, the \\"curious\\" adlibs, and great use of animation and color techniques. I remember Mr. Disney did apologize for this production because it had no \\"heart.\\" He should really look at the last fifteen minutes. . .there are plenty of hearts!<br /><br />Alice character is superb, and uniquely Disney's. The Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the White Rabbit, the Queen Of Hearts, the Caterpillar, and the one and only Cheshire Cat, all work together!<br /><br />There are some references to hallucinogenics, since Alice experiances outburst changes in form and size, and the appearing cup changes from various rocks and stones towards the end of the movie, suggest just that.<br /><br />The fact that she was really asleep during the entire journey, yet again suggests. . . she had crashed out. Just a thought.
078322737X|2.0|This was and is a great,great, movie the way it was \\"originally\\" conceived! Then, DVDs came along with better visuals and the \\"required 5.1 soundtrack.\\" Because of it's popularity, Lucas had to \\"improve\\" the already wonderful soundtrack inorder to \\"repackage\\" his wonderful creation. Well, you guessed it, he, or his audio engineers, ruined the sound by \\"updating\\" it. Yes, the visuals are improved but the \\"new and improved audio track\\" is barely acceptable which is a shame as there is so much wonderful music in this film. (\\"He must have changed the editing monitor speakers he used originally to a \\"better and improved version.\\" The \\"new\\" sound track is simply too \\"accurate\\" and \\"uninvolving\\" on a modern sound system and does not capture the emotions of the original event as well as what you can hear on the \\"old\\" VHS and LaserDisc versions. Sad, as the \\"new\\" soundtrack, while sounding ok , can distract on a quality home audio/video system these days. Stay with the VHS or LaserDisc versions if your lucky enough to have them.
B000002I6V|5.0|Amazing what a difference 35 years can make to the memory.  But still a great album.
0375507256|4.0|I've never read another book like this, although it reminded me of many other books.    To have stories written in the 19th,20th, 21st and possibly 22nd centuries, nested together like those Russian nesting dolls, watching as the past affects the future and then the future making the past more comprehensible, was an act very few could manage.  It has a compelling story that follows these people through time.  Bravo to David Mitchell.  It was a treat.  I'm recommending it to my book club.  I'll be interested in their reactions.
B00008G9JN|5.0|Tull was a controversial band back in the 70's.  Were they a rock band at all?  Were they even a prog. rock band like Yes and Floyd?  Or were they something totally unclassifiable?  With an enigmatic leader, Ian Anderson, they have some of the biggest hits ever, Aqualung and Locomotive Breath,  both with plenty of radio play, and followed up that success with two albums that had only one song each (Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play, both which strangely became #1 albums- how is that possible?).   Then in 1977, after a couple of other very successful albums, they popped out Songs From the Wood.  This album rocks in a real woodsy sort of way. The title track sounds great on the remastered version, especially the vocals.  Hunting Girl is a real standout too.  This album stands as a musical work that will never go out of style.  It is timeless and a keeper in your collection.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I think it's wonderfully rare that John Mayer can successfully go off and do his own thing in this blues-charged live album. Not many musicians can tread off the beaten path and then come back to win a Grammy. Unfortunately, he won for \\"pop\\" star, a title I'm sure he's not too thrilled about but has to accept. <br /> <br />This album truly explores the blues style and virtuoso of John Mayer. And as a fan since he first appeared on the scene, I'm very happy with it. It fulfills my curiousity but leaves me asking for more.
074356619X|5.0|I loved the movie, but I adore the cds. The cds get deeper and more specific. If you are trying to gain control over your life and thoughts you must have these cds. They are great for those of us with long commutes or just late night listening. The change you will experience is worth the purchase.
B000063DFQ|5.0|The first time I heard this record,I was about thirteen. It had already been out for about four years,and in that time its acclaim had grown to the point where it was already widely regarded as a classic. Once I heard the brief drum solo that opens lead track Where Eagles Dare, it was easy to hear why. There was something so fierce about Piece Of Mind. Perhaps it was the production of Martin Birch, or the primal screams and powerful wails of Bruce Dickinson. Maybe it was nine-round axe duel between Adrian Smith and Dave Murray or the masterful rhythm section of Steve Harris and Nicko McBrain at work. I think it was all of those, but most importantly, it was the songwriting that made this album the highlight of metal's most creatively stellar year,1983.<br /><br />Listen to the aural acrobatics of the aforementioned Where Eagles Dare which features one of the best examples of daring riffery and acrobatic melody the metal genre has to offer. Even the album's weakest track, Quest For Fire, thrusts, dodges, lunges, and parries with proud cunning. Every composition on Piece Of Mind broke ground, and the album as a whole could not have been written by any other band. Piece of Mind is one of those records that always seemed to be not unlike an anthology of self-contained, yet vaguely related stories. When reading the acknowledgements, it comes as no surprise that the band thanks Alistair MacLean and Frank Herbert for the inspiration that their novels brought to their work. My young mind was engrossed in the richly British escapism of the lyrics and still is to this day. Where Eagles Dare sent us on a mission to infiltrate a castle in the Austrian Alps. The intricate dirge Revelations told a tale of Biblical intrigue. Flight Of Icarus brought the myth of one who tempts fate with man-made wings to a whole new generation. Die With Your Boots On gave us warnings from Nostradamus. The Trooper, with its rousing, galloping twin-lead riff, put us right onto a battlefield during the Crimean war. Still Life told us a ghost story. Quest For Fire took us back to a prehistoric time that never actually was. Sun And Steel took us into the mind of Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, and finale To Tame A Land thrust us far beyond our universe to Frank Herbert's desert planet Arrakis. Never before or since has a album taken me to so many fantastic realms in such a short period of time. This, combined with everything else I have written, is what makes Piece Of Mind the definitive Iron Maiden experience. All in all it remains a swashbuckling thriller of sound and fury that has withstood the onslaught of Father Time long enough to become my favorite album ever.n war. Still Life told us a ghost story.

B000006TRV|2.0|It's amazing to see the raves for \\"The Wall\\" from what I am going to assume are a group of pretty serious Floyd fans.  Simply put <br />, this album, while better (perhaps, although not certainly) than most of the contemporaneous pop product, is not up to the FLoyd's usual standards, either from a lyrical, or a musical, perspective. <br /> <br />Early on, Syd Barrett set the bar particularly high with stuff like Astronomy Domine (see a chord chart for this song; it uses progressive tonality, a technique more normally found in late nineteenth-century classical music, i.e. Carl Nielsen or Gustav Mahler).  But Floyd's first outings w/ Dave Gilmour more than fulfilled the early promise of Barrett's pen.  \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\" and either of the film soundtracks \\"More\\" and \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" are strong, stronger certainly than \\"The Wall.\\" <br /> <br />Floyd finally struck gold with \\"Meddle.\\"  The perfect balance was struck between exploratory musical stylings and knife-sharp lyrics.  The quasi-symphonic titan \\"Echoes\\" is counterbalanced by the creepy musings on madness of \\"Fearless.\\"  Indeed, Waters' self-obsessed navel-gazing is kept in check by Gilmour and Wright's lush guitars and keyboards.   <br /> <br />In the final analysis, Floyd's creativity waned through successive efforts (a small rebound with the masterful \\"Animals\\") until finally reaching its nadir with \\"The Final Cut.\\" <br /> <br />Waters, recognizing this, left the band and declared it \\"artistically dead.\\"  The pronouncement was a bit cynical, given that Waters himself had held the band's head under the water of his own paranoiac vision for its final four albums.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|I have nothing to add to what most people who reviewed this positively said.  All I would add is that the fencing scene is very well done, and not surprisingly, highly authentic, especially the last move done by O'Neil: the grab / behind the back stab maneuver is right out of contemporary fencing manuals of the time.  What is interesting though, is that they are both fencing left-handed...what are the odds of that happening (makes me wonder if the Pantinkin / Elwes fencing scene in Princess Bride 15 years later was some sort of homage to that?)
B000KC8O3S|5.0|There is a passion, an almost \\"cult\\" following for this character of more than thirty years on the BBC...our hero presented himself in a fashion we've never known before, traveling throughout universe and time in the TARDIS...who else could it be...think a minute--- the illustrious DOCTOR WHO.<br /><br />Silva Screen release of Murray Gold's music from the hit BBC TV series \\"Doctor Who\\" on December 4th. This album includes the 'must have' new version of Ron Grainer's immortal theme. Also included are songs written by Murray and performed by Neil Hannon (The Divine Comedy). \\"Song for 10\\" which appeared in last year's Christmas Special and a new offering, \\"Love Don't Roam\\", which will feature in this year's Yuletide special \\"The Runaway Bride\\" --- Who is now sitting proudly atop the iTunes soundtrack chart and has also gained a major placing in their main pop album chart at number 24.<br /><br />Murray Gold (our composer), does an outstanding job, which I believe is a GREAT LISTEN ... This is the first release of music from the series revival and includes the acclaimed new version of the Ron Grainer theme ... The album contains a 2-minute and 36-second \\"album version\\" of the \\"Doctor Who Theme,\\" the familiar haunting melody with more symphonics passages of what can only be described as glorious jubilation from an orchestral vantage point.<br /><br />Murray Gold (born 1969, Portsmouth, England) is a British composer for stage, film, and television and a dramatist for both theatre and radio --- He has been nominated for a BAFTA three times in the category Best Original Television Music, for Vanity Fair (1999) Queer as Folk (2000) and for Casanova (2006) --- His score for the BAFTA winning film Kiss of Life was awarded the 'Mozart Prize of the 7th Art' by a French jury at Aubagne in 2003. He has also been nominated four times by the Royal Television Society in categories relating to music for television --- His radio play Electricity was awarded the Michael Imison award for best new play after its broadcast on Radio 3 in 2001. It subsequently transferred to the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2004 and was performed with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role --- Others of his plays include 50 Revolutions performed by the Oxford Stage Company at the Whitehall Theatre, London in 2000 and Resolution at Battersea Arts Centre in 1994 --- He has scored a number of British and American films, most recently Death at a Funeral directed by Frank Oz and Mischief Night, directed by Penny Woolcock --- Since 2005, he has served as musical director for the new series of Doctor Who for the BBC.

[1] [2] [3] --- Gold's initial arrangement of the Doctor Who theme was controversial among some fans due to his decision to leave out the \\"middle eight\\" portion of the theme, though he later reinstated it for a rearrangement of the theme introduced in the series' 2005 Christmas episode and subsequently used in the 2006 series of the programme --- He also wrote the theme tunes for Doctor Who spin-offs The Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood, and composes music for the latter series alongside Ben Foster --- In 2006 he recorded a new arrangement of the Blue Peter theme music. Viewers were told the new version would be used from September onwards but, as of November, it has only been used occasionally as incidental music and never for the main titles --- He has worked with Russell T Davies, writer and executive producer of Doctor Who, many times in the past on projects such as Casanova (starring David Tennant), The Second Coming (starring Christopher Eccleston) and Queer as Folk 1 & 2 --- He has also provided the incidental music for the 2000s version of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) alongside James Bond composer David Arnold, who providedthe theme tune. None of his incidental music was released on the soundtrack CD for that show --- He wrote the theme tune for the Channel 4 series Shameless. Though this is not yet separately commercially available as a standalone track, the publishers can be contacted to register interest.

B0006PV5VC|5.0|This multichannel SACD is recorded in the front 3 channels only, as this is what the technicians and their top notch analog equipment recorded more than 40 years ago.  At that time the Chicago Symphony and conductor Fritz Reiner were both at the top of their game, and this recording has not been equalled to this day.  Absolutely puts the listener in the middle of the ninth or tenth row, and provides the clean dynamic sound of the best recordings made today!  This is the wonderful Scheherazade I grew up with, but much better because of SACD technology and my current audio system.
B0000024K1|5.0|You know, I once saw someone say that this shouldn't be considered music, and in one way, that person is right: it's an aural explosion on record, in a way not even an industrial band could execute it. This record came out at a time I was still coloring walls, but even I could connect well with it, it is that good. The record hasn't aged a bit. The first I heard from P.E. was \\"Fear of a Black Planet\\" a few years back, and I really enjoyed that one. I got to this and was shocked at how it was EVEN better. <br /> <br />Chuck D. and Flavor Flav have a delivery that can't be missed, and the Bomb Squad use some awesome loops and samples. The 3 or 4 interludes on here are great too, and not even those come off as filler. The lyrics are intellectual social/political message. There's not much quite like this today, in fact that might even be an understatement. Some tracks come off like siren tracks, like listening to songs like \\"Night of the Living Baseheads\\" and such. The live samples add to the energy of this record. It is a hip-hop record, but you don't have to be a fan of the genre to enjoy this. The energy could be appreciated by a rock fan, and the instrumental of a track like \\"Black Steel...\\" could be appreciated by a jazz fan maybe. It doesn't need to be limited to genres. It's a great record, period. The influence is something that's even been going on through the times, and that doesn't need to be explained or even justified. <br /> <br />It's cheaply priced and an amazing album, even sounding fresh nearly 20 years. It doesn't even need remastering any time soon! That's all the more impressive. There is so little not to like about this record, it is recommended to everyone from me.
0790729628|3.0|I was very much conflicted over this movie. It is well directed and has depth to its themes but I had a hard time getting into this movie. At times the pace of the movie got so slow that it had a sedative effect on me.  The backdrop of the futuristic world, is the real highlight of this movie. \
B000FZETIO|5.0|I had very fond memories of this movie, but never got it on DVD.  DH got it for my last birthday and it is as wonderful as I remember it.  Love the special features, but wish there was more.  It's a great movie.

0525476881|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. John Green is a litature genius. John and his brother Hank are soooo funny just like his book. If you want to laugh really hard check out their video blogs. Trust me, read this book!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|If you were obsessed with Make Yourself and Morning View, you might just find yourself in a similar position with Light Grenades.  Reading the editorial review on this album kinda blew my mind.  You guys think that many people consider The Crow Left of The Murder as Incubus' best album?  Are you mad?  That album was fine, in its own respect, but it was much less experimental and much more 'metal' than classic Incubus.  Gone was the experimentation of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Fungus Amungus.  It was just Rock/Metal.  Light Grenades, on the other hand, has the ebb and flow of a thought-out album.  Where Crow was put together in literally a month, Light Grenades is the culmination of an incredibly long-lasting career of successful music making.<br /><br />Specifically, Love Hurts, taking a cliche subject, makes a great song that one can sing with like Drive or Pardon Me.  Diamonds and Coal, Oil and Water, and Dig: all of these are songs that you would expect from a mature Incubus.  They finally put it together, especially after what I considered a dissapointment in Crow.  Look, if you want to hear new 'Classic Incubus'.... pick up Light Grenades.  It's one of the rare albums that you get hooked on with the first listening.  No second or third playing needed (as I found with Crow).  Open your mind and enjoy!
0312287550|5.0|This is an extraordinary book.  The story is Epic.  The characters are likeable, loveable, tragic, human, profound, wise, and even humorous.   <br /> <br />The story includes so much imaginative detail and presents such a unique (and rather large) slice of history.  It's one of the few books that has made a lasting impression on me.  I have read it twice (so far).  It has forever changed the way that I understand history and the lives of ancient people.  Not only that, but it's one of those rare stories that keeps you turning the pages (even the second time you read it). <br /> <br />If you like historical fiction, then you should definitely read this book.
B000H30B2C|5.0|When I first saw Peter Jackson's re-make of Kong in the theater, I liked it a lot as an hommage, and a modern re-telling, of one of the classic films of all time. In the theater, though, it seemed almost too much, both in length and its non-stop assult on the senses in the final two acts.<br /><br />So I'm glad to report how pleased I am with the Extended Edition release.  As in LOTR, the Extended Edition has a way of seeming *shorter* because, I suspect, the pace is more regulated and plot details are filled in that make the whole seem more seamless.  The picture quality is stunning, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is great so far as it goes.  (My only gripe: why no Dolby 7.1 EX option, or even better, a DTS ES option as in LOTR?)<br /><br />The extras are great and are far more informative and detailed than the Production Diaries, for those of us who are fascinated by the process of filmmaking.<br /><br />To give some context for these comments, they come from a Monster Kid of the '50's who grew up on the classic monsters on television and in Famous Monsters magazine.  I hope that Jackson's film in whatever cut, and extras such are provided here, inspire new generations of monster kids and filmmakers alike.  It probably seems old-fashioned to say so, but this quality of devotion to filmmaking, and this kind of glimpse into the world behind the film, offer modern-day viewers an experience that we \\"back in the day\\" could only have dreamed of.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My daughter read this story in 2nd grade and now as a young working professional enjoyed it all over again.  There is a lesson to be learned by both young children and adult viewers alike.  I recommend this as a story to be shared with families at the time of year when our attention turns to how many and how much, but this story jolts us back to the real spirit of sharing and caring.
0060531053|3.0|Overrated.  It's confusing organized; things seem interspersed randomly (hydrometers, for example, are discussed fully in two separate places).      It has much useful information, but some things seem obviously wrong.  Its basic beer recipe and procedure include no aromatic hops.  Those hops are very easy to use (throw then in the brewing kettle at or near the end of the boil), and they're a big part of successful brewing the way it's done today.  (For lots of us it's hard to make beer too hoppy.)  Related point:  it's not up to date, even though the third edition is from 2003; current equipment and ingredients are ignored or noted in random places.    It's also unattractive--amateurish photographs and silly cartoons--and annoyingly written.  For example, it CONSTANTLY tells you to drink homebrewed beer while brewing.  Since brewing involves boiling large amounts of liquids for extended periods and then transferring them among containers, that seems to me like a recipe for third degree burns.  Being told over and over to \\"Relax, Have A Homebrew\\" is not that helpful.  Straightforward, up to date information:  that's what helps me relax and enjoy my successful homebrews.    And that's what I find in John Palmer's far better book, How to Brew.  Well organized, clear explanations, good photographs and not unattractive.  And the latest version is very up to date.
6301744160|5.0|What was my favorite movie from when I was a child?  I would have guessed \\"Mary Poppins\\", because of how much I wanted to see and re-see it.  Others that would compete with it include \\"Hey There, It's Yogi Bear\\", \\"The Jungle Book\\", \\"Batman\\", \\"The Aristocats\\", \\"Never A Dull Moment\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"That Darn Cat\\", and from watching it countless times on TV, of course, \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\".  But when I think about it, my favorite would be more of a mature movie I saw with my dad when it first came out:  \\"Fantastic Voyage.\\"<br /><br />Why did this become my favorite childhood movie?  Because it actually mirrored the tastes I would grow into.  For example, this movie was an adventure, with plenty of suspense.  Second, it was a mystery, with a few clues thrown here and there.  Third, it was science fiction, which prompted my creativity.<br /><br />Another thing is that this movie is decent enough to see with your children.  There are a couple of mild hints of our modern viewpoint, such as Grant's comment that CMDF (Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces) could stand for \\"Consolidated Mobilization of Delinquent Females\\", or showing Raquel Welch slip out of her outfit into a form fitting aquatic suit.  But this film proves you can have a suspenseful adventure and entertaining movie without sex, language, and gore.<br /><br />This movie is great at atmosphere, as well as special effects.  It took five minutes into the movie before you heard the first word.  There are a lot of sequences prior to the main action that there is no spoken dialog.  This effectively keeps the viewer in the dark about what will happen next.<br /><br />Consider this review complete if you have not seen it, because I'm about to spoil a surprise.  Ready?  One more thing that distinguishes this picture is a positive view of people of faith.  There is a discussion between a person who believes in a creator and an athiestic evolutionist.  Nowadays, the villain would undoubtedly be the former, but not so in this picture.<br /><br />Let me respond to a couple of the not-as-enthusiastic reviews.  One mentions we never know if the operation was successful, but that is an asumption that can be made, when we see how happy everyone is when they came out.  Another jokes about the cold war mentality and shows the intolerance many evolutionists have to a discussion on the issue (the movie merely debates whether there was a Creator, and it did not answer the question).  But there is no reference to Russia in the picture:  merely a vague \\"the other side\\".  Some people are naive to think we'll enter a world of perfect peace without war, short of a Creator that many don't want around.respond to a couple of the not-as-enthusiastic reviews.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|(FYI, this review is for people who are new to Sigur Ros like me)<br /><br />I bought this album during Thanksgiving break of last year from Waterloo Records when I was visiting my relatives in Texas. This is my first Sigur Ros album and it certainly won't be my last. Takk... has a very ambient feel throughout, with a very positive but emotional vibe. It's like IDM music, but with less beats and with vocals. Jonsi Birgisson, Georg Holm, Kjartan Sveinsson and Orri Dyrason all work together to create a sound that connects with the listener emotionally and puts all sorts of images in their heads. Lead singer Jonsi doesn't speak any actual real words, but a language that Sigur Ros pretty much made themselves (but the language does resemble the language spoken in Iceland, which is where they're from). But that doesn't matter, because like I said, the soundscapes and atmospheres are what you should focus on. Takk... really is an amazing and ambient album. The band doesn't focus on technical skill, but atmosphere really. Every time I listen to the album I hear something new. There are classical arangements, soft-sounding guitars and bass, lush drum beats that almost sound electronic, and a bunch of sounds from household items like clocks (Saeglopur is a good example of this).<br /><br />If I had to pick favorites off the CD, I'd say that Saeglopar, Meo Blodnasir, Andvari, and Hoppipolla are the ones that caught my interest the most. But the whole album is more than worth listening to the whole way through.<br /><br />The band also made a music video for Hoppipolla. It pretty strange - a bunch of old people pretending they're kids again, but the music is what made me want to buy the album.<br /><br />If you love bands like Radiohead and Pink Floyd, quit reading this, go to your local CD store, and buy Takk... NOW.
B00005MNP7|5.0|By October of 1979, Blondie were a part of the rock mainstream thanks to the strength of \\"Heart of Glass,\\" and Debbie Harry's Marilyn Monroeish sex appeal, both of which propelled the Parallel Lines album into the Top 10 in May of that year. Eat to the Beat was the first Blondie album the public was waiting for and while it received great reviews and eventually went platinum, it seemed a little underrated at the time or perhaps just a little neglected as Parallel Lines is what many fans were still hooked on. But I would say Eat to the Beat is a slightly better album because it fully absorbed the New Wave sound into the rock mainstream. New Wave was no longer a label nor a safer term to describe punk as it became mass-accepted. The band once said this was their quickest album to record, just having come off the road before beginning their first U.S. tour as headliners. This is also their most raw and rockin' album. Debbie's lyrics have never had more poetic expression on songs like \\"Dreaming,\\" and \\"Union City Blue,\\" while her voice has never had more edgy allure. Harry's allure continues on songs like \\"Shayla\\", the pop lullaby \\"Sound-A-Sleep,\\" and \\"Atomic,\\"(now a dance classic having been remixed numerous times). But Harry never sounded more punk as she screams from the depths of her soul, \\"I don't want you to go, please don't leave me alone,\\" on \\"Victor.\\" What many fans may not remember is how this album's attempt to cover several musical bases worked(unlike 1980's AutoAmerican where the group received a mostly poor reception). Before the reggae flavored, \\"The Tide is High,\\" there was \\"Die Young, Stay Pretty,\\" \\"The Hardest Part\\" moved to a funk groove, and \\"Accidents Never Happen,\\" a personal favorite, is one of the best songs Debbie and the band ever brought to vinyl.

1582701709|1.0|This is enough for any Christian to nix this book: \\"There is no blackboard in the sky on which God as written your purpose, your mission in life...your purpose is what you say it is. Your mission is the mission you give yourself. Your life will be what you create it as, and no will stand in judgment of it, now or ever.\\" - Neale Donald Walsch<br /><br />So it appears that Neale Donald Walsch (the great?) has in one fell swoop displayed that the Lord Jesus Christ is a liar, and all who believe in the Sovereign Creator God, who has revealed himself in the sacred writings contained in the Old and New Testaments, who (according to that Word) has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass for his own glory, who has declared that indeed everyone shall give an account to him on JUDGEMENT DAY ... is just a fable.<br /><br />Gee, I wonder what other brilliant things Rhonda and her ring of self-deceived deceivers have to say? No, I don't really.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, since your reality is the one you create, then we can just say to all those silly Jews from the holocaust \\"Hey, you should've been thinking more positively. If you'd just visualized yourselves sitting under a palm tree drinking a pina colada, you'd've been out of those naughtly little deathcamps lickety split!\\" Yeah, and I guess when that unexpecting gal walking down the street is raped by some black-hearted monster, it's because she was busy projecting her reality. She must have wanted to experience being violated, and perhaps being dismembered, and perhaps being killed. Isn't this the logical conclusion one must draw from such drivel?<br /><br />Relativism and blasphemy are not proper methods to employ when thinking about life.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I cannot stress enough the importance of seeing this film - it was life changing for me.   Should be required veiwing for all consumers, educational professionals, students, scientists, and policy makers,  - we need to change the world for our children and for our children's children.   A positive message that change is possible - but we must make the effort.   Knowledge is power - let's use this knowledge to positively and effectively change our world for the better.  This is it - all we have - this earth, no boundaries, no walls we are on this big blue ball traveling through space together; we need to wake up and see the truth. Or maybe send the world's leaders up in orbit for a while! (time out fashion! :) )
1582701709|1.0|This book is a glossy, re-packaged version of better books:  Pick up anything by Dr. Wayne Dyer or Anthony Robbins, and you'll get the same thing -- and more. It is the LAW OF ATTRACTION.  This book is colorful and designed to have some \\"mystery\\" to it -- capitalizing on the DaVinci code mystery of \\"ancient secrets.\\"  Hats off to Rhonda Byrne for saying the same thing that's been said before, but dumbing it down and oversimplifying it for the masses.  This isn't new stuff, and it is no secret.  It's the LAW OF ATTRACTION -- Go buy Wayne Dyer or Tony Robbins or Terry Cole Whittaker or Dr. Norman Vincent Peale or anyone else -- much better and more insightful, same stuff.  I feel ripped off buying this book; it's all about selling the \\"mystery,\\" not about anything new. It's not deep, not insightful, but should win an award for graphics -- but not for content.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a movie as much as I did Little Miss Sunshine.  It was the true laughter through tears movie...and I was able to connect with each character.  Awesome !!!
B00005JN0T|5.0|I have to agree with all the reviewers who praise the movie because of the action.  If you are someone who loves action films you will NOT be disappointed with I, Robot.  Will Smith as the main character is pretty good in the action man \\"save the world\\" type roles, and fortunately he continues to impress me here. <br /> <br />Some very good special effects further convince me that this is truly a wonderful film.  Wonderful to look at *and* provides a solid storyline.  Just the thought of robots taking over the world only for one robot to be a \\"bad bot\\" is a great set-up for an interesting story, and it works.   <br /> <br />You don't have to worry about having to put up with any kind of robotic talk or whatever, because the story makes sense.  The robots in the film  try to act and talk human-like, which  makes it easier for us, the viewers, to understand what's going on.   <br /> <br />The storyline mainly focuses on the humans interacting with each other and trying to figure out where the bad robots are located instead of, what I initially feared, a really weird and hard-to-follow sci-fi story that only makes sense to a select few viewers.  That's NOT the case.  ANYONE can get into I, Robot.  Even if you have ZERO interest in robots, you will understand what's happening and won't ever feel confused.  When the humans interact with the robots, it will all make sense.   <br /> <br />In other words, the storyline in this film is laid out easily and understandably for all the people who normally don't have much interest in robots.  This is a good thing. <br /> <br />The only problem I have is that, whenever I hear the name of this movie or see the pictures of the robots, the Alan Parsons Project immediately comes to mind.  Gee, I wonder why that is. :)

For any fan of Calvin and Hobbes, that's  all that need be said. I can spend ten minutes in the morning reading a few pages and chuckle for the rest of the day.
1932100660|2.0|While this book has many valid points, the end conclusion is incomplete and for that matter wrong.  The vital book to read is \\"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration,\\" written by Weston A. Price almost 8 decades ago that without a doubt proved the link between health and food.  Price traveled all over the world and found not a single healthy isolated culture that didn't ingest animal meat and/or dairy.  Some Canadian Indians were 100% meat eaters at times, and yet they were strong vibrant people with very few ailments.  Once these isolated people left their traditional diet and ate the diet of processed white foods they lost many of their teeth and fell victim in scores to TB and other illnesses.  Humans are not herbavours.  We are omnivours.  Are some plant foods amazing?  Yes.  Are they the total answer?  No.  A study was conducted a ways back (early 90's I think) that paneled a group of centenarians (people aged 100 and over) and not a single one was a vegetarian.  What better proof is there?  Enjoy your plants, but you better eat some quality meat too or you will probably not see 100.  I have yet to hear a vegetarian explain away B-12 (because you can't).
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Lee himself would most likely (and with good reason) criticize me for this viewpoint, but I have always regarded him highly as a director, but have often felt at least a little disappointed by his films.  Even in highly competent movies like _25th Hour_ and _Do the Right Thing_, I have always felt that there was something about the movie, usually a rather simplistic move to get the movie towards a sense of completion, that has held me back from liking it unconditionally.  Perhaps it is that need for completion, that sense of making the movie an independent-from-life example for closure, that always keeps me a little away from full acceptance, because Lee is otherwise so good at characterizing beyond the screen--many of his characters exist in a wonderful netherworld of being familiar and gritty while maintaining purpose in the movie.  But in the end, the characters become obvious for merely 'being there' to make the film come together in the end when Lee drops the ball, so to speak.<br /><br />Yet I maintain so much hope for Lee and have more hope in him than in some other directors who DO seem to be at the top of their craft.  And I maintain that Lee will make something that is no less than one of the top 10 movies of ALL TIME if he is finally able to let go of cinematic closure and instead let the closure take place in the audience.<br /><br />This movie works pretty much on the typical Lee paradigm--nothing less than spectacular in its progress, and then falling a little short in the end.  Denzel Washington is an ambitious detective looking to make first grade when a bank robbery negotiation falls into his lap.  A major bank in NYC has been taken hostage by robbers who seem to have something up their sleeve other than the usual objectives.  The bank owner (Christopher Plummer) has a fear of dire consequences should certain items on hold in the bank fall into the wrong hands and hires Jodie Foster to take care of this mess with full discretion.<br /><br />The film is wonderfully off-kilter in how it presents criminals and villains and heroes--it is hard to see who is who for a long time, at first because of the grittiness of the characterization, but also because of the brilliance of the crime.  This film outdoes great depictions of criminal genius like _The Usual Suspects_ and others, for the nature and details of the crime are not all held to the very end.  Lee wisely avoids the modern trend of 'twist endings' such as the poor _Saw_ series and Shamalyan's paler efforts and instead lets us into the process, though of course withholding ocasional vital details to keep us guessing at the entire picture.<br /><br />The plot itself is interspersed with little Lee touches of NYC culture, where cops argue among themselves what dollar bills are made of, and a street construction worker can know the sound of Albanian without being able to understand a word of it.  For 7/8 of the movie, you will most likely be kept guessing and even laughing in disbelief, for this is no ordinary crime drama, and Washington of course enlivens his character into a depth few actors can reach...<br /><br />...but the end of the movie will leave you just a little disappointed.  It would seem that a situation as wonderfully complex and intricate as Lee builds for and hour and forty-five minutes could never sum up very quickly and must leave you with at least SOMETHING you'll have to debate with others over some post-theatre Chinese food, but Lee cannot resist letting everyone fade into a cellular dark by the end of the movie, and so things wrap up just a little too nicely.  The movie does offer some good challenges as to who are the good guys and who are the bad (there will be just the slightest mention from Jodie Foster that will help, if you listen closely), but in the end _Inside Man_ wants to play with its own title in many different directions, but can't do it all within its own medium.  Lee is still on his way to earning the credit of being one of the all time greats, but he's going to have to keep his brilliance out until the end before the title is fully his.g one of the all time greats, but he's going to have to keep his brilliance out until the end before the title is fully his. <br />
0240808452|5.0|This book definitely is an off-shoot of James McMullan's High Focus approach to drawing, although Mattesi discusses many of his own concepts as well. It is similar to High Focus in that it teaches its readers: to see the figure as being made up of three dimensional forms, to use the all important hierarchical approach, NOT to just copy the figure using measurements and negative space estimations, to feel the forms as they are being drawn, and view drawing as a very interactive experience. It is different from McMullan's approach in that Mattesi strongly emphasizes the importance of finding directional and applied \\"forces\\" (hence the name) throughout the figure. This becomes a very important concept for animators because of the nature of animating. In the figure drawings, the forces, the squashes, and the stretches are all exagerated, just as an animator has to exagerate his or her key drawings in this manner. Also, the drawings in the book tend to reflect Mattesi's background in animation, whereas McMullan's drawings are more realistic. I believe this book is written specifically for animators. However, the classically trained artist has much to learn from this book as well.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Being a Maine native I have read and watched every Stephen King book and movie IT being my favorite book and movie. I've watched the movie since it came out when I was knee high to a grasshopper and it still creeps me out beacause of it being based on a shape shifting clown. If you have not seen IT go on amazon and buy it you wont regret it.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is a great movie. For several reasons Some guys are questioning the fact that this movie is too bloody. But here it has a noble purpose. (this is not Sin city or Reservoir dogs) Read the gospels. Our Saviour didn't come here for pleasure, or for chatting with Herod, drink some wine, have wonderful feasts and marry a beautiful girl (some fools say he married Mary Magdalene)and be eternally happy as Hollywood wants us to believe. No. He came here to redeem us. He came here to show us how a Christian should face suffering And above this, he came here to show us the real face of the Father, Our Father that is LOVE. Seeing this movie is seeing how much Jesus loves us. Meditation  of The Passion of the Christ is the DEVOTION of Devotions. A lot of conversions have occurred after people started meditating these sufferings of Our Lord. ALL the Saints have meditated them and had a profound devotion for them. Even more, they recommended this devotion in order to obtain real sanctity of life, because the REAL LOVE (only somebody that is willing to suffer like this and die for you , really loves you!) attracts LOVERS.    Regarding the accusations of \\"antisemitism\\", I just have one recommendation. It is not a secret that Jews hate Jesus and His Church. This movie only describes  what really happened according to the Gospels. A sympathetic Sanhedrin  would be a lie. They wanted Jesus dead and that's what Mel shows us in this movie. What's wrong with that???  But if you're a Christian you'll understand that is the devil who doesn't want people to watch this movie because Jesus' victory against him was on the Cross. Buy this movie!!!!!
B000JJSJR8|4.0|I mean that statement in two ways. First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest. This is better than Goodfellas by a wide margin. All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!). If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own. I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's on HD-DVD. The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television. It's almost 3-D ! The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate. That's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. There is the obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae ! I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running. This and Batman Begins are the reasons you should own an HD DVD player ! Note: I have the HD DVD drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !
0061120073|5.0|Wow - this one has been on my \\"must read\\" list for a long time, and I am so glad I finally picked it up.  I read it in 2 sittings, and could barely put it down.  The coming-of-age story of Francie Nolan is apparently based on Betty Smith's own life - and she is a magician with the written word. Her descriptions of the deepest poverty of Brooklyn during WWI and insights into the minds and souls of fragile yet incredibly strong people are stunning.  Her observations about the human condition are timeless.  Tree is a real treasure of American literature...

1582701709|5.0|The book brings about a validation of the basic teachings of every religion, belief and philosophy of time. What it does it put the teachings into terms that are able to give you options on what YOU want in your life. Naysayers of the book are surely negative personalities whose cup is half empty. I ask them...look at the persons who have risen from diversity by just changing their thinking.  We have heard of the power of positive thinking, this is just another chapter that brings being thankful and loving ourselves to the forefront. I used to teach children art and all children love to draw until someone tells them they can't...then they stop and honesty believe they can't. Thus we are what we think about ourselves and our abilities.  This book points out that we are in control of our thinking. After reading the book, I feel I can and will live a better more loving life. I say spread the word!
B000066C6Z|5.0|Many of the Germans in the audience loved it too! One of my favorite films.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Vengeance is sweet.  Possibly no actor has received a more impassioned and negative response after being named the new James Bond than Daniel Craig.  He had few strong supporters in the general populace and most were pushing for a variety of other actors from Clive Owen (who would indeed have been quite good) to the recently deposed Pierce Brosnan.  Websites were set up to protest the choice of Craig.  Petitions were circulated denouncing his selection and demanding an alternative.  For once, in a huge way, the general public was proved wrong.  The producers really did know what they were doing and the selection of Daniel Craig as James Bond is certainly the most brilliant decision that they have made since the 007 first made his appearance onscreen nearly fifty years ago.<br /><br />Not just in the selection of Craig, but in a host of minor decisions, this Bond film signals not merely a return to form but a thorough going revamping.  It begins predictably enough, with a dramatic chase scene.  But this stands out as one of the finest openings of any film in the series, with Bond in chase of a bomber who possesses the acrobatic skills of Jackie Chan in his prime.  But some of the changes can be seen in the opening credits.  Instead of nubile women prancing around in profile, we see Bond himself with a design based upon the four card suits.  In fact, the film as a whole is considerably less sexist than most Bond films, though it can hardly be hailed a feminist classic.<br /><br />In a way, this film present almost an alternative reality Bond.  To make it work we all have to pretend that we've never heard of Bond, that he wasn't a creation of the Cold War, that we can imagine that in 2006 we are seeing Bond at the outset of his career.  In this alternative world we get almost instantly views of Bond that we had never seen before.  For one thing, this is not a psychologically normal human being.  Although Timothy Dalton had given us a self-conflicted Bond and in that sense more psychologically complex, Craig's Bond is a borderline sociopath, completely untroubled by the death of a woman he had near made love to the previous evening.  He also is the least quipping of the Bonds, the least apt to see humor in situations and provide a key funny line.  Facially he is not a terribly handsome man, with crude features.  He truly does seem--both mentally and physically--a bit of a brute.  Dressing him up in a tux truly is like putting dress clothing on a Neanderthal, albeit one with a high I.Q. and even quicker wits.  All in all, it is an amazing recreation.  All the previous Bonds had been essentially men of elegance who had learned violence; Craig's Bond is a thug who cleans up well.  And of all the Bonds, including Sean Connery, Craig is the one who most exudes menace and danger.<br /><br />The film as a whole is the least silly Bond film in quite some time.  The focus is away from elaborate gimmicks and massive props that take up an entire set and back to individuals fighting individuals.  The film recalls FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER more than any Bond films since.  And unlike most of the Bond films since those two, it features a story that truly is of interest.  There are twists that truly are twists and intrigue that is genuinely surprising.<br /><br />And for the first time that I can remember, I am actually looking forward to the next Bond film.  I know that there have been those who still cared about Bond, but I long ago ceased to be among them.  I would certainly watch each one as it came out, but now I am actually expectant.  On every level this is easily among the best Bond films ever.  Some even call this the best Bond movie ever and I would not argue very hard against them.  I personally would rate it slightly behind FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER, but certainly no lower than that.<br /><br />I would like to do a call out for one performer in a small role:  Christina Cole.  Many will know her from starring in the British supernatural series HEX.  She is one of the most natural beauties in the movies today and I heartily hope she gets bigger and better roles in the near future.  She appears here in a small role as the desk receptionist in the hotel in the Bahamas.  She should be starring in movies, not playing small bit roles.r from starring in the British supernatural series HEX.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has done it again. I love this album. While there are some similarities to Mask and Mirror, this one still stands on its own. It's lovely and satisfying.
0060989157|5.0|I'll start out by saying this book is a great read. The stories that are told are obnoxious, hilarious, crude but above all very interesting. When I starting reading this book I knew a little about the band but when I finished I felt as though I knew everything about them. Each member of the band had different insights and opinions which made it more interesting. I highly suggest it.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. From the openening scene this movie takes you by the throat with both hands and doesn't let go. Its all there like it never left - Scorceses use of tracking shots and slow mo sequences take you back to the movies that made this man great. His use and arrangement of recorded music on his soundtracks is without peer.  Scorcese has put together what is arguably one the best casts in movie history.. at least since Goodfellas. Every actor in this movie finds time to chew the scenery without going over the top Pacino style which is a testament to Scorcese and his directing skills. This is a man who got Paul Newman his 1st elusive Oscar and let Joe Pesci run amok in Goodfellas in what is one of the all time great mafia hood portrayals. All thats left is the icing on the cake - this movie should clean house at the Oscars. For those that disagree I suggest a blanket party with a pillowcase full of Raging Bull and Taxi Driver VHS tapes to knock yourself back into coherence.
B000002UDB|5.0|Sure the film is terrible, but this disc probably has some of the best singles the Beatles ever released.  Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane are arguably the best 45 ever released (Hey Jude/Revolution might be the only other one that could potentially challenge it). Hello Goodbye is one of the greatest pop songs ever.  I am the Walrus simply fun.  And all of the other little second rate classics (Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're a Rich Man, etc.) are better than most groups' first rate efforts.
B00004Y6NK|5.0|1986 - Phil Collins is back behind the controls & is now playing all of the drums (except on in the the way that you use it - steve ferrone).  I'm not sure why he didn't play all the drums on Behind the Sun...  Anyway this album consisted of just Clapton (guitar), Collins (drums/production), phillinganes (keys/vocals), & east (bass/vocals). Tina Turner also makes a vocal appearance on tearing us apart.  this album is much more produced than behind the sun with more keyboard & synth bass lines shooting at more R&B as BTS aimed for a more bluesy/rocky sound.  That's okay I guess...  Collins definitely had a feel for R&B in his solo stuff & it showed in his outside production as well & clapton agreed.  Clapton's vocals are strong & smoky as in BTS & he sounds healthy & happy.  His guitaring is more distorted with plenty of good solo work retaining his characteristic claptonisitic sound.  East & phillinganes bring a more synth-bass sound typical in the mid 80s & loved by collins (listen to no jacket required).  Collins drumming is all live leaving the drum machine alone except for backing rhythm. His complex syncopation is way above par per usual as he's using the typical high tom fills & lots of high-hat.  Good tunes are grand illusion, hold on, walk away, & hung up on your love, & holy mother.  holy mother was cowritten by clapton's/collins's good friend stephen bishop who couldn't find much commerical success in the mid 80s.  The album is good but just didn't give me the chills that behind the sun did.  it was overproduced.  I usually like phil production but this one was too R&B & not enough rock.  but then it was 1986.  I thought there was too much going on including too much programming & sequencing.  I prefer more live instrumentation.  Overall a good album but not as good as BTS.  These guys toured in 1986-87 between collins's breaks on his genesis tour(invisible touch tour).  Those live shows were great & the recreations of these august tunes were better as they were more stripped down.  There are some good DVDs out there including live in birmingham '86 & live at monteaux '86 - both great shows.  August would prove to be the end of the Collins/Clapton production era but they would play together on clapton's 1989 journeyman album (bad love - collins on drums) & collins's 1989 but seriously album (wish it would rain down - clapton on guitar).  I my opinion their relationship in the mid 80s helped to keep an industry of inmature music respectable by creating mature/complex/articulate music to marvel over.
B00005A46U|4.0|Caravan is very late 1960s and early 1970s, but the songs are certainly fun to list to.
B000002I7R|4.0|1982 - plant proved to have a knack when picking musicicns for his 1st post zeppelin solo effort.  He of course produced the album on his own.  he picked up a well known drummer with a healthy reputation, phil collins...  Also, robbie blunt on guitar who had played with petty.  On bass he chose paul martinez.  Keyboard responsibilities were handled by jezz woodroffe, another black sabbath veteran.  On 2 songs cozy powell (black sabbath - long time friend) plays drums (slow dancer / like I've never been gone...).  The album has a fairly stripped down funky sound but retains a subtle rock rhythm at the same time.  Plants voice is strong & full with an emotional sincerity.  phil collins, per usual, sets the tone with his complex tempo changes & fast drum fills that are immediately identifiable.  Cozy powell's boring snare drum fills are lackluster next to collins's intricate & articulate philosophy of modern drumming.  the album is consistent with some fairly high points  including burning down one side, midnight in samosa, worse than detroit, & mystery title.  Plant's vocal range is as varied as usual with hints of R&B to straight rock to funky feels.  Blunt's guitar licks are fairly simple with little distortion.  A good moment is in \\"worse than detroit\\" when he does a mark knofler-like lick in the bridge (pretty good).  The bass patterns are muted & unsubstantial but are covered well by collins awesome drumming.  The keyboards are soft but have some good sounds with typical string elements.  Overall a good debut album with most of the fire coming from plant's voice & collins's drums.  the bands fuses well though.  The entire band (except powell) returns in 1983 for principle of moments (a similar but better effort from plant)
B000FA57RG|4.0|THIS CD/DVD FELL SHORT ON A GOOD NUMBER OF SONGS FROM THE CONCERT TOUR.
B000002JK4|5.0|1983 - Plant returned with the same musician lineup except powell & now including barriemore barlow (jethro tull) as pictures at eleven (1982) collins (drums) / blunt (guitar) / martinez (bass) / woodroffe (keys) / barlow (drums on 2 tracks).  There are also some backup vocalists here now as well that do some fine work.  The album was again produced by plant.  the album has the same funky formula as \\"pictures\\" but is far more keyboard driven & finds collins much more rhythmically aggressive especially on in the mood & horizontal departure.  Plant's voice is in good standing & delivers both heavy & light perfomances well.  Big log is a good performance with the standard collins drum machine backing him up(sounds great).  In the mood is a great tune with an awesome driving tom-fill solo by collins along with great high-hat work.  Woodroffe's keyboard pattern's are much more haunting in this album & have a louder presence than in \\"pictures\\".  Keyboards are great particularily in thru' with the 2 step & in the mood.  Blunt also does some pretty good guitar work especially in messin' with mekon, in the mood, & big log.  Bass lines are boring.  I usually like barlow (especially in tull's song's from the wood & stormwatch) as he is fairly aggressive but his 2 appearances in tracks 4&7 are boring.  overall, great album & I listen to it alot.  This album was followed by a tour in 1983 with collins on drums (no dvd though).  Plant & collins were good pals & he played drums for zeppelin at live aid reunion in 1985.  Plant/Collins duo gave music some depth in early 80s during the techno craze.  Too bad it didn't last longer.
0307237699|1.0|This review is probably one which is going to be slammed, because Senator Obama has such appeal for so many looking for fresh new hope and they will take the questions raised as more than a higher reaching for answers. <br />Politicians since John Kennedy have \\"written\\" books to prove they are intelligent and introduce themselves to the voting world. Senator Obama's first book dealt with the touching subject of his childhood. The problem is he left out much of his Islamic past and his life started at age 10 along with fictional names of people in his life. <br />As an author, everyone knows it is impossible to get a book published and yet a college graduate not only has a book published but is signed to a million dollar deal before he soon arises in Illinois and is immediately asked on David Letterman, \\"When are you running for President?\\", when he had not served one day in the Senate. <br />It is those things which begs to ask in this book, \\"What kind of American Dream\\", does Senator Obama foresee for all Americans? The majority of us are not going to be graced with million dollar contracts when we have not accomplished a single thing in life. <br />As stated, books are telling in swaying people. A book about childhood and one about dreams. We can all aspire to that, but what Barak Obama writes is not in line with dreams but a reality which if put in plain English might not sound so appealing. <br />Would it sound appealing if someone said, \\"Someone is going to come in and take from your bank account 50% of your wages and it will take you until June to pay that bill off and you can then worry about paying your mortgages, sending kids to school and medical insurance.\\" That logically would not sound so good. Yet Senator Obama in reality advocates the continuance of this \\"dream\\" upon Americans and in his own words on the now campaign trail wants more of people's money to fund \\"dreams\\" for people who are not working for them or citizens of the United States. <br />Dreams are wonderful things as are books as long as someone who is empowered by the Oval Office or Congress does not have rights to legally steal what you have worked for and give it to someone else. <br />So for questions, I would have preferred instead of softballs ones which asked how does someone get wonderful book deals? <br />How does someone arise to meteoric power and be booked on Letterman to be asked when they are running for President, since over 299 million Americans are not? <br />How does Senator Obama's dream equate with the literal American Dream our founding fathers sat down of a Republic where government had no power to tax your income which allowed you the citizen freedom to prosper and not have to have license or law inflicted upon every moment of your life? <br />Senator Barak Hussein Obama, (he neglects to inform readers that is his real name also), dream is one of socialism and huge government. If that is what America desires then that is exactly what Americans have voted for in the current Republispenders who with Democrats have run up trillions of dollar in debt while inflation ruins each of us. <br />If you want to read a real book on American Dreams, then I earnestly suggest The Strenuous Life by Theodore Roosevelt or Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman. Those books equate dreams which gave all Americans including Senator Obama the reality of the best place on earth to live. <br />There is nothing audacious about socialism and hiding behind one's borders. This book is more in tune with the French Dream which like all Europe is a disaster in socialism. <br />Thank you for your time.
060634604X|1.0|After reading two biographies back-to-back, I decided to read some quick, cheap, pulpy fiction.  I chose A Million Little Pieces.  I can't believe anyone bought this as a memoir!  From the first page, it reads like a treatment for a pretentiously gritty screenplay designed as a breakout, \\"serious acting\\" vehicle for some comedic actor (Tim Allen, Jim Carrey, Jimmy Fallon, etc).   <br />  <br />I started to wonder, perhaps James Frey never even went to rehab...?  From someone who knows a thing or two about rehab, it certainly doesn't sound authentic.  And the writing the writing the writing...Oh my God!  So repetitious and oh so juvenile.  Arctic Blue - locked and loaded - wanting wanting wanting - Why was everything in threes?  I cringe everytime I think about this book.
B000J10EQU|4.0|Like the undying, loyal Spidey fans before Toby Macguire became everyone's \\"friendly neighborhood Spider-man\\", Superman fans the world over have had to wait patiently, often despairingly for Krypton's last son to once again explode onto the big screen accompanied by John Williams' trademark Superman music. Though their \\"Man of Tomorrow\\" thirst was held at bay by a slew of television shows; several well-done cartoon incarnations, the adequate Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, and the groundbreaking new mythology Smallville, their hunger never abated as they waited breathlessly for Christopher Reeve's heir. They were patient through an endless slew of casting calls that rumored everyone from David Boreanz, (Angel, Bones) to Heath Ledger (A Knight's Tale, The Patriot), and certainly breathed a big sigh of relief when the Timothy Burton (Batman) and Nicolas Cage (The Rock, Face/Off) ship passed. Don't get me wrong, Nick is absolutely perfect for Marvel's next big screen dash, Ghostrider - he is a promising cast for Johnny Blaze. But Supes? Sorry.<br /><br />Finally, when Brian Singer (X-men, X-men 2) signed on, Superman fans breathed a big sigh of relief.<br /><br />However, trouble was on the horizon. Were they over-budget? Brandon who? And what's up with that cod-piece?<br /><br />Look, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's....a flop?<br /><br />As all movie goers got the chance to see this past week, that was hardly the case. Although not quite the resounding success of another rejuvenated series, Batman Begins, (to steal a phrase from Connor Mcloud - there can be only ONE Batman, and he is Christian Bale), Superman Returns was a solid return to the box office. Even if he needs a little work on his Superman - which is debatable - Routh nails Clark Kent much better than I ever felt Reeves did, taking a bumbling moron and transforming him into a well-intentioned, kind if somewhat nice guy who often gets over looked (Although, the determined face he makes when his glasses fall off and he's on the verge of revealing himself to Lois was so reminiscent of the late Christopher Reeve, it was kind of spooky).<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was good as Lex Luthor, but he caters more to the Gene Hackman school of the character - a con man, certainly amoral and therefore a menace, but really in it for a quick buck. I truly hope Warner Bros gives the Smallville cast a shot at big screen fame, I personally feel the Michael Rosenbaum Luthor to be far more evil and malicious.<br /><br />There are enough twists and virtual plot bombs - sorry, you can't twist the arm of this reviewer - to make watching the movie a worthwhile experience. That, and as someone who was never a personal fan of Margot Kidder, (sorry Margot - Terri Hatcher you're not), I liked Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane.<br /><br />The only downside of the movie was Luthor's master plot. It wasn't bad, and the resulting Christ imagery of a kryptonite-weakened Superman getting beaten down and kicked as if he was on the way to Golgotha was moving and actually quite a daring move by Singer, but it was just a money-making scheme. I would have liked it a little better had there been something a little bigger as the big, bad plot in the movie. Oh well, rumor has it the next movie is going to examine the groundbreaking Doomsday and Death of Superman comic book line, and THAT is a breathtaking thought...as long as they don't hire Ang Lee to direct and have the \\"Comish\\" play Doomsday in a big rubber suit.<br /><br />Can anyone say \\"Hulk Smash?\\"<br /><br />A final note for all you gals: wives and significant others who equate superhero movies with testosterone and men in tights, (look....is that Carey Elwes?), Singer has been quoted as calling this movie a chick flick, and it really is.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|Twenty-two years ago, Sam (Jared Padalecki of Gilmore Girls and House of Wax) and Dean (Jensen Ackles of Smallville and Dark Angel) Winchester lost their mother in a fiery blaze that consumed their home and changed their lives forever. No ordinary house fire, the flames that robbed them of their mother was born of a dark force of evil. Certain no one would believe him, their father John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan from Grey's Anatomy) spent the following years training them as warriors, on a quest to destroy every evil thing lurking in the dark corners of the world and destroy the demon that killed their mother. Sam eventually tires of their violent life; however, and longs for his own life. After an argument that drives a deep wedge between father and son, Sam leaves his father's quest to pursue a law degree at Stanford.<br /><br />Two years later, Dean shows up on Sam's doorstep - because their father has gone missing. Convinced he's \\"gone to ground\\" because he's finally latched onto the trail of the demon responsible for their mother's death, Dean insists that Sam rejoin him to find their father and kill the demon that killed their mother. Sam resists at first, determined to live his own life: but fate conspires against him, as the demon returns to claim Sam's girlfriend.<br /><br />Season One of Supernatural pitted Sam and Dean Winchester against all of the classic \\"urban legend\\" and horror story myths; from \\"Bloody Mary,\\" a guy in a trenchcoat with a hook (I Know What You Did Last Summer), pagan harvest gods feeding on humans for their body parts (Jeepers Creepers), and some of the best, old-fashioned supernatural baddies: werewolves, zombies, wendigos, shapeshifters, angels of death, and of course, it wouldn't be the CW (formerly the WB) without some vampires lurking about.<br /><br />In the hands of less capable story-writers and actors, many of the storylines would be flat and uninspired, borrowing so heavily from \\"stock-in-store\\" monster myths, but Padalecki and Ackles consistently give excellent performances, raising the show above these common myths. Both actors played second-fiddle long enough on other CW shows, Smallville and Gilmore Girls respectively, and halfway through the second season, they are clearly here to say awhile.<br /><br />Partway through Season Two and Supernatural is walking the tightrope many similar shows have in the past: carrying on a unifying story arc that's compelling and note-worthy, but having enough stand-alone shows to draw in new viewers. The now canceled Angel, (a Joss Whedon Buffy spin-off staring David Boreanz of Bones), fell prey to this in the end: too heavy and involved a story arc alienated new viewers as their numbers started slipping. However, Supernatural continues to find the right balance, letting viewers enjoy self-contained, isolated episodes while dangling story-arc elements at the end of each show.<br /><br />Good acting, excellent character development, and a looming war on the horizon between humans and demons - one that Sam will play an unknown role in, especially given his developing psychic powers and the demon's promise that he has \\"plans for him\\" - promises a series to keep an eye on. Christians are likely to be divided on this show, just as they were with Buffy the Vampire Slayer; some will enjoy the recurring themes of \\"good vs. evil\\"; others will chafe at the occult references, and the fact that the Winchesters rely on their own human efforts to battle evil, rather than God. Either way, Supernatural provides a welcome alternative to campy shows about teens drinking and having irresponsible sex, like most of all the other CW offerings.ently give excellent performances, raising the show above these common myths.

B000IHY9SE|3.0|This cd was okay. I was disappointed that there were not more Eminem tracks on here. Its a majority of his proteges like the members of D12, Stat Quo, etc. The beats are nice and some of the guys are really skilled lyricists. Overall, there is nothing really outstanding about this cd. If you like mixtapes or underground rappers, Id say check it out. If you like more concrete music, then go another route.

B000000WJK|5.0|a storm in heaven is one of the most gorgeous albums i've ever heard. it is not like the verve's other albums. this is in a genre of it's own. imagine layers upon layers of soothing, swirling creamy guitar melodies and vocals drenched in reverb dreaminess that wrap around your head until you feel as though you're being gently lifted up into the clouds. listening to this album is like being in that place in between sleep and awake. you know, that state of mind when you wake up in your bed and hear the birds chirping outside, but you are still in your dream? that's what this album is like. is it musical paradise.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|I am not much of an Iron Man fan and but since he is a Marvel charactor I thought check it out and see what they did with it.  I was surprise It has a pretty good story line.  I like it more than I thought I would have.  I would as say it is an acceptable version it doesn't wow you but it is good family entertainment.  Can't wait to see the Doctor Strange one that I think will be a good one.
B000I0RR76|5.0|This is one cracking good film, and a superb transfer to HD DVD. The picture quality of the Technicolor transfer is jaw dropping. But what makes this disc even more special are the amazing extras. The special features include two documentaries, short films and cartoons, a dozen trailers for Flynn films such as Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, and a Warner Night at the Movies feature. <br />  <br />Leonard Maltin's Warner Night at the Movies 1938 is a real time capsule, which recreates a full evening's movie programme of the time. In includes a vintage newsreel, musical short with Freddie Rich and His Orchestra performing several big band numbers, Katnip College cartoon, and a trailer for Angels with Dirty Faces (for any James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart or Ann Sheridan fans).  <br />  <br />The real gems are the two documentaries, around 1 hour each, both of which are worth the price of this disc alone... <br />  <br />'Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of The Adventures of Robin Hood'  presented by film historian Rudy Behlmer, Leonard Maltin and others  features extensive interviews and archival footage of the production, cast and crew. <br />  <br />'Glorious Technicolor' plots the development of the Technicolor film process from beginning to end. It not only provides a great insight to the science, but features clips of the production process for some of the all time great movies such as Gone With the Wind, Red Shoes, Wizard of Oz, etc. It also includes color screen tests for a who's who of Hollywood stars of the 1930's and 40's - Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis, Betty Grable, Maureen O'Hara and more. For any fan of the golden age of Hollywood this disc is a must have. <br />
B00007GZQI|4.0|I don't put much significance on the social commentary of movies, but I enjoy this picture's insulting of human greed and pride.  And, it is hilarious while doing it.  It doesn't even take itself seriously.  I think it is very funny while targeting some of Humanity's worst characteristics.
6305252572|5.0|Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy play off each other really well in this movie -  Nolte with his loud, gritty voice and Murphy with his suave demeanor. This movie and Another 48 Hours are both worth watching more than once. I definitely recommend this movie as worth owning.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|From a person that does not read the comics but watches the movies based on them, I thought it was good. And I'm going to go see it again. The action was awesome. The villians I agree with some people, were deffeted pretty quickly, but I loved it. Nicholas Cage was very funny. I loved it when he changed into Ghost Rider because he'd get this like psychotic crazed look and laugh. It was great.<br /><br />I think they did the best they could with making this movie. You're never really going to get it as perfect as you want it if you read the comic or the book that it's BASED on. Exsample: Harry Potter. People who've read the book feel cheated out of many scenes and characters. People that didn't read the book like it.<br /><br />  Just try to think of it this way. It's BASED on the comic, not the comic come to life. Otherwise you may be dissapointed if you are hard core fan of the comic.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This is the kind of movie you might want to watch it a few times to see how could've you missed the signs the first time. Is different and keeps you guessing through out the entire picture, what is going to happen next. I really enjoyed it and is the kind of motion picture that I could watch over and over again, and never get tired of it.
B00005JPKC|4.0|A well acted movie, also one of the most affecting films I've seen in quite a time.  It left me quite depressed for a while.  In a way it mirrors the times we are living in with our older generation's fatalistic view of the future.      You know the ending - the Americans win the battle with very, very high casualties, but that is overshadowed by the 90 - 95% death rate for the Japanese defenders.      Just as the Japanese leadership on Iwo Jima believed that the only thing they could do was give hell to the invaders and then die, it seems like many of the older generation now feel there is nothing that can be done to change anything and are just waiting for the apocalypse.      But there is hope in the younger generation who believe a united, prosperous and peaceful planet is possible and want to live in it, and are well represented in the film by the young Japanese recruit, Saigo.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Ever since they began conquering the world a couple years back (or at least the part of it that watches PBS) Celtic Woman has owned the top spot of the Billboard World chart, with each disc knocked off only by their own projects. This concert will only further entrench them in that position. It is utterly fantastic.<br /><br />Even with those breakout CD sales, the core of their success has lain in their concert presentation. The CDs have been like talismans that invoke the concert experience and keep it fresh until you have time to sit and watch it again. But the stage is where they truly rule.<br /><br />The first video was beautiful, ethereal, and occasionally almost spiritual. But \\"A New Journey\\" adds one more element: Fun! Only fiddler Mairead Nesbitt did any real moving and shaking in the original. The vocalists were - apart from gracefully walking up and down ramps - fairly static. This actually lent itself to the otherworldly quality of the show but also subtracted color from the ladies' personalities.<br /><br />Well, they are alive and in living color in this show. The greatest benefit goes, hands down, to Lisa Kelly. More than the other vocalists, who hearken primarily from classical and traditional roots, Kelly's background is predominantly in musical theater. Her skills in dramatic presentation, audience connection, and dance are unleashed here and she absolutely relishes it. And Nesbitt? Her already energetic presentation takes off into the utterly dynamic.<br /><br />This shift is apparent in all the performances. Meav Ni Mhaolchatha, only months removed from maternity leave, seems to find a whole new level of projection and assurance and it suits her. And the addition of the nearly operatic Hayley Westenra gooses everyone's vocal game up another notch.<br /><br />If I have any nit to pick, it may be in the set list's frontloading of the new material. But that's a minor quibble. All in all, it's very impressive.
0938045695|5.0|Kettlebells have certain advantages in training, namely, their ability to combine weight training with aerobics in the same workout. And you can still do most of the usual weight training stuff. Kettlebells also give so called \\"what the hell\\" effect: by doing only kettlebell training you accidentally discover that you are actually getting better in other, not related activities, such as weightlifting or running. Kettlebell training is generally safe and technically not difficult, if you take it step by step.    In this book Pavel sets standards against which you can gauge your progress. Rite of Passage, performing 200 snatches in ten minutes is the landmark all kettlebellers are striving for. You won't understand why until you try. This book presents training principles for the long term. There is also a discussion safety and trauma.    It is futile to try and convince skeptics that kettlebells are good. If you think of it, all sports are ultimately meaningless, and doing something more intensive than a brisk walk does not significantly add to your health. Why do we do snatches for numbers then? Same reason as trying to run one kilometer under three minutes or deadlift tripple the bodyweight, or trying to win a sparring: for fun and the sense of achievement. You can get a feel of kettlebell training on the forum on the publisher's site, [...].    The only way to understand kettlebells is to try them. And if you decide to do it - this is the book to have.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|This DVD set has wonderful songs that many of us have known for years, as well as great contemporary music that is upbeat and fun. I loved putting the DVDs on and just having it as background as I did other things. I'm very glad I purchased this set.
B000M341QE|4.0|The previews prior to the theatrical release of this film were reason enough for me to see it.  Brilliant and memorable performances from a very well rounded veteran and all-star cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio(I was beginning to think that he was overrated) shows that he can really pull it off playing rookie cop Billy Costigan....downright epic performances from Matt Damon's portrayal of half cop half criminal Colin Sullivan and Mark Wahlberg's performance as Costigan's next in chain of command and hard as nails Staff Sgt. and Martin Sheen's performance as the one calling the shots as Capt. Queenam.  Of course, my hat will go off to one of Hollywood's most precious gems and my ultimate motivation for seeing this movie...Jack Nicholson's performance as aging mobster Frank Costello(think of Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone in the Godfather but a lot more edgier).  This film in my opinion would solidify Scorsese's mark in Hollywood(as if he already didn't have one).  Set in Scorsese's trademark filming base of Boston and listening to the cast speaking in that Northern Boston dialogue(I bet the dialogue coach had a hell of a time with that one)...even though Wahlberg's accent wasn't coached...this film will of course go down as one of the best of 2006 and by the end of the decade will go down as one of the tops of the decade.  Nuff said...just go and see it already.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is mind boggling, strategic planning, family fun. My sister-in-law introduced us to the game and now my family has that bring-it-on-cause-your-going-down excitement every time we play.
B00005JPFQ|3.0|Previews had me curious enough to spend 7.50 last night to see this remake of yet another comic book hero.  Here we have the story(or supposed story) of motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze and his tale of how he went from ordinary daredevil to the Devil's sheriff of justice by night.  Nicolas Cage's performance of lead character Blaze left a lot more to be desired...almost statuesque.  Peter Fonda's performance as the grim reaper was almost in my mind below this screen legend's standards.  Eva Mendes as Johnny's lost love and news reported Roxanne Simpson couldn't do much to save it.  However, the films dark and almost gothic nature was very well suited for Wes Bentley's portrayal of Satan's son who wants to \\"overthrow\\" his father and possess the ultimate scroll containing a thousand of lost souls(hints of the same plot as Little Nicky anyone??).  Sam Elliott's performance of local gravedigger and former Ghost Rider Carter Slade just wasn't enough.  My rating is based off of the stunning visual effects and that's probably about it.  Also worthy of a bad note is the poor direction of Mark Robert Johnson(also directed Daredevil)....I will agree with the Marvel reviewer in stating that Johnson needs to stay away from the comic book remake genre and find something a little more suited for him.  In my opinion, wasn't really worth the 7.50 I paid at the theater....I could've waited for the DVD but you be the judge.
B000MG1YBG|5.0|THIS GUY IS GONNA BE HUGE ALL OVER THE WORLD.INFECTIOUS MELODIES AND HOOKS THAT WILL HAVE YOU HUMMING HIS SONGS ALL THE TIME.SIMON COWELL IS EATING HIS SHIRT RIGHT NOW I BET,TELLING HIM HE'S NO GOOD AND WILL NEVER MAKE IT BIG A FEW YEARS AGO..WELL HE'S BEEN AT #1 FOR OVER A MONTH W/GRACE KELLY AND THE ALBUM ALSO DEBUT LIKE THE SINGLE AT #1...WORLD DOMINATION IS SOON AT HAND.LOOK WHO'S HAVING THE LAST LAUGH NOW....IT'S THAT RAVISHING MIKA!
B000J3OTSM|4.0|Aside from the average acting, this is a really enjoyable, fun movie.  It's mostly predictable, but it's full of great dancing and a nice story line.  Mario is super hot in here (although he isn't a lead actor in this) and Channing Tatum is good (I've loved him since Coach Carter).  There is fantastic music and while the movies main appeal is directed at teens and 20 somethings, I think everyone who loves dancing and good music will appreciate this movie.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|I know, opinions are like a*#holes but it still makes me wonder what the people that gave 'Dusk' a lousy 1-star rating are smoking!  How can you love 'Badlands' and 'Voodoo Highway' and NOT like this album even a little?!<br /><br />Although these recordings were merely meant as demos, tracked live in-studio by the full band with no or minimal overdubs, the quality is never in question and the writing is consistently strong.  The vibe on 'Dusk' is somewhat darker and more brooding that especially the debut but once again Jake, Ray, Jeff and Greg create the perfect marriage between muscular, melodic hard rock, raw-yet-soulful blues, and 70's white boy funk that takes you back to the likes of Trapeze, James Gang, Zep, and Bolin-era Purple.  And 'Healer', 'Tribal Moon', 'Walking Attitude' and 'The Fire Lasts Forever' (how appropriate a song title!) deliver in spades!  And if you thought '3-Day Funk' was funkay wait until you put on 'Fat Cat' - pure joy!<br /><br />Also of note - 'Dusk' features the original version of 'The River', a beautiful, introspective ballad Greg Chaisson re-did on his 'It's About Time' solo album (w/ the Riversogs' Rob Lamothe on vocals; Rob coincidentally was also BADLANDS' first choice to replace Ray when he quit the band in '92), and 'Sun Red Sun' is a song Jake later re-moded E-Z-O-style for the aborted Wicked Alliance project as 'Blood Provider'.  It's also great to see the band finally put the epic 'Lord Knows' to tape after kicking it around for the debut album but ultimately deciding against it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  There is A LOT to love here and I consider this album an unexpected gift from the rock gods as it gives us one last chance to hear the brilliant Ray Gillen do what he does best with the greatest 80's band to never attain superstar status.  What a curtain call!
B000LC4CVA|2.0|I must say that I was very disappointed with this DVD; perhaps the young ladies had reached such heights with their original DVD and show Celtic Woman, they could only fall to the earth. I have viewed the original DVD so many times the DVD actually skips. <br />After absolutely enjoying the concert when they visited the D.C. area and wearing out the original DVD, I assumed this was the reason they had chosen to includ Hayley Westenera. I am an admirer of her work as well her piece de resistance being Pure; so I received this DVD with great anticipation. <br />What a disappointment; so disappointed that I have viewed this DVD only once. The performances were hollow, contrived and uninspired in stark contrast to the original DVD. The muzzle that was placed upon Hayley Westenra was puzzling. I'm very happy that I bought this product at a reduced price on Amazon; had I paid full price I would have been pi..ed. <br />I will rent their next production before purchasing.
B00005JKED|4.0|Training Day sheds light (as it should do) on police corruption as well as on crime and violence in the streets and neighborhoods of Los Angeles.   <br />It is officer Hoyt's first day under the supervision and tutelage of LAPD detective Alonzo Harris, when things take a quick turn for the unexpected... <br />Ethan Hawke, Denzel Washington, Snoop Dogg, Tom Berenger, Macy Gray (!), Samantha Esteban (who is HOT!!!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well. <br />In short, the music, the acting, the plot, the setting, and the dialogues are all good. <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.   <br />
B000LC55F2|4.0|The production value of this movie is excellent.  I felt transported back to a time in history when science and superstition were practically brothers in the minds of most men.  \\"The Prestige\\" bridges these two perspectives nicely to the point that one begins to think that magic really does exist where these two competing magicians are concerned.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry the film splendidly, even during the very slow moments, with Michael Caine and the lovely Scarlett Johansson pitching in occasionally to give the story added lift.  This is the second film that director Christopher Nolan has worked with Christian Bale, the first being \\"Batman Begins\\", and as in that film the photography in \\"The Prestige\\" is equally dark and evocative.  Christopher Nolan also directed two other deliberately paced films, \\"Memento\\" and \\"Insomnia\\".  \\"The Prestige\\" is appropriately draped in shadows, secrecy, and deceit.  I saw this movie in the theater and by the time it ended with a surprising plot twist I knew that I would have to see it again when it came out on DVD just to see what I missed the first time around.  The pace of \\"The Presitge\\" is slow going, but I found the film overall to be very satisfying.  Recommended.
B00004XMVH|4.0|U-571 brings to the screen a WWII tale of naval warfare.   <br />It is Spring 1942 and the setting is the North Atlantic Ocean.  The navy of the Axis Powers pretty much rules the waves (and below the waves for that matter) and the Allies are hard pressed to stop them primarily due to the secret codes the German fleet uses.  Their hopes lie in a daring operation aimed at securing the Enigma code machine, which in turn might turn the tide of the war.  It is under these circumstances that the S-33 sub sails to intercept the U-571... <br />Matthew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well. <br />In short, the music, the acting, the plot, the setting, and the dialogues are all good. <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.   <br />
B000GPI2EK|4.0|4.5 stars. The solitary weakness of Progressive Metal is when the musicians lose track of the song they were trying to write in order to accomplish something new or unexpected.  While these direction shifts can be extremely interesting and exhilarating, the downside is that one really needs to pay attention to the constantly shifting soundscapes.  Mastodon's first album \\"Remission\\" was a blast of fresh air, and then \\"Leviathan\\" packed in a multitude of riffs to go along with the progressive leanings to create an unquestionable masterpiece of Progressive Metal.  \\"Blood Mountain\\" is Progressive Metal at its most progressive, and should please fans who prefer unexpected shifts in tempo as opposed to the grooving riffs that predominated \\"Leviathan\\".  To be completely honest, this band is entirely too talented and at the peak of their powers to write a bad album.  I went back and forth on this release.  At first I thought \\"Blood Mountain\\" might be a \\"Leviathan, part II\\", so I was initially disappointed.  After about ten spins, it takes that long to absorb the complex songcraft on this recording, I began to appreciate \\"Blood Mountain\\" for what it is: Technical Progressive Metal.  Just listen to \\"Capillarian Crest\\" and be completely in awe of the timing involved to pull off this song.  While I prefer \\"Leviathan\\" over \\"Blood Mountain\\" or \\"Remission\\", each album has its own unique identity while sounding forever like Mastodon.  Some may find \\"Blood Mountain\\" progressive to a fault, but it is nonetheless a progression for the band.  I would rather they tried out new sounds and ideas rather than remain the same, anyway.  Though it took quite a while for me to properly digest, I believe \\"Blood Mountain\\" is a good album, showcasing the musical talents of all involved.  Running time: (68:14)    1. THE WOLF IS LOOSE (3:34)  2. CRYSTAL SKULL (3:27)  3. SLEEPING GIANT (5:36)  4. CAPILLARIAN CREST (4:25)  5. CIRCLE OF CYSQUATCH (3:19)  6. BLADECATCHER (3:20)  7. COLONY OF BIRCHMEN (4:19)  8. HUNTERS OF THE SKY (3:52)  9. HAND OF STONE (3:30)  10. THIS MORTAL SOIL (5:00)  11. SIBERIAN DIVIDE (5:32)  12. PENDULOUS SKIN (22:15)    By the way, the last song is not really over twenty minutes long.  It is  an instrumental that ends about five minutes in and then there is dead air. I hit fast-forward until I heard one of the band members reading a fan letter, and then that was it.  Therefore, the running time for the actual music is more like 51 minutes and change.  Take it easy.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|Murray Gold's music for the new series of Doctor Who is an integral layer of the show. In arrangements stretching from synthesized and choral work to live full orchestras, Gold has carried a syncretic but diverse vision for the series' music through the show's revival. <br /> <br />There are powerfully melodic cues, from heartbreakingly lyrical character pieces such as \\"Rose's Theme\\" to haunting solos within tunes such as \\"The Impossible Planet.\\" The series' epic scale is reflected in motifs such as \\"Rose Defeats the Daleks\\" and \\"Tooth and Claw;\\" the latter cue also blends cinema-musical genres nicely between the vocal and percussion traditions of martial arts scoring and a more symphonic-sounding adventure-movie music style. Playful tracks such as the \\"Monster Bossa\\" reflect the show's sense of humor, and thumping good action tunes such as \\"Westminster Bridge\\" and \\"UNIT\\" round out the soundtrack's variety. <br /> <br />Beyond typical incidental music, the CD also includes Gold's pop compositions for the series. \\"Doomsday\\" is an angsty tune with a beating rock heart--and an inspired instrumentation. Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy adds his vocals to an extended version of \\"Song for Ten,\\" and (with a jazz sax and swing choir) \\"Love Don't Roam\\" played in the second Christmas special episode (\\"The Runaway Bride\\"). <br /> <br />The 31 tracks on this CD offer over 75 minutes of music. They are in fact just a start towards representing the scope of Gold's vision and creative stamina for the series' music. It's not the same as the old Doctor Who music, and it is wonderful.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|This is the best concert DVD I own. Dido's performance is great and the vocals are even better than the studio recordings. The band uses a great variety of instruments. Great DTS sound.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|This film, IMHO, launched Will Smith as an international action star.  Yes, the film follows a formula-but in this case its a formula that actually works.  This story takes a simple what-if plan-that's been used a billion times-and caters to America's patriotism.  In a dire humanitarian crisis, we as a people can put our differences aside and fight together for our basic need to survive.  Anyone at any time can become a hero and can become your brother-in-arms.  Good script, descend acting and one heck of a feel good movie.  Overall, I highly recommend it.
B000002G8J|5.0|The last good Clapton album and the last one with his 70's backup band.  <br />Highlights... <br />WALK OUT IN THE RAIN (Bob Dylan song done very well as an opener) <br />I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU ANY TIME (J J Cale song)  <br />PROMISES(the hit)  <br />TULSA TIME(Danny Flowers song and the best one here) <br />
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I think Ashton Kutcher did a good job on this film. I recall that Kutcher has never made a film like this, and his first thriller was somewhat peculiar. Not just any old thriller, this one would keep you on the edge of your seat from the start to the finish. A weird title however, but the tag line explains all. Change one thing, change everything. I think this automatically gets you thinking, and as the film proceeds, it gets harder.<br /><br />As you may all already be aware, there are two versions of the film (well the Ending) and they both have completely different appeal, for me the directors ending is superior, it is more unexpected and far more shocking, but it does end the film on a slight downer, which is why the original release was happier (even though it didn't really fit the film).
B000002G89|5.0|The comeback. Claptons passion for the blues is doing the talking here, but still slowhand makes the best album of his career. He had replaced his heroin addiction with an alcohol fixation, which made him very laid back, but it all works here very well.
B000J103PC|3.0|From what I can remember when I read the book, the film stayed fairly true to the book...which is very unusual.  If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />It's the story of a young girl who moves to NYC to become a journalist but finds herself working as an assistant for a top notch fashion magazine, which is way out of her style league. The girl is a go-getter so she does what she has to do to make it work and ends up becoming the right hand (wo)man to the editor and chief changing her life (for better or worse) forever.<br /><br />The movie, even though trashed by some critics as \\"shallow and unfulfilling\\", is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, \\"Runway\\", so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.<br /><br />All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the \\"high-class\\" laughs that it packs.
B000002JK4|5.0|This is Robert Plants finest work since Zeppelins Physical Grafitti. Robbie Blunt is an excellent guitarist, he deserved way more credit and is a forgotton great. <br />3 songs...In The Mood, Thru' With The Two Step, Big Log are among the best work of Roberts entire career.  <br />
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I haven't even received this item yet but I am sure that it is fantastic.  This was absolutely the best movie I have seen in a long time.  It is the best romantic comedy to come out since \\"Pretty Woman\\".  I never buy soundtracks either but that is just what I did as soon as I got home from the movie.  The chemistry between Hugh and Drew is wonderful and the music is great.  If they made another CD I would definitely buy it.  I am raving about this movie to anyone and everyone that will listen !!!  I can't wait for the movie to come out to add it to my favorites and watch it over and over again.  I definitely recommend this soundtrack and this movie.  This is the best romantic movie to come out in a long time.
B00005JPFQ|5.0|i understand what the die hard comic readers feel, but since i never read comic's, i think it was a great movie!ghostrider is not your average good wholesome superhero, he's the complete opposite! i don't know how you all feel, but i'm a little tired of the nice superheros like superman and spiderman! give me the batmans,wolverines and ghostrider!
6300216365|4.0|Allan Felix (Woody Allen), a movie critic and avid fan of Humphrey Bogart, must re-acquaint himself with the bachelor lifestyle after his wife leaves him.  He looks to his best friend, Dick (Tony Roberts) and his wife, Linda (a very young Diane Keaton) for help.  Allan is a clumsy nebbish and is visited by the spirit of Humphrey Bogart (Jerry Lacy) who gives him advice in wooing the ladies--specifically Linda, who he finds himself falling for, and finds an opportunity to declare his love for her when Dick is out of town.  What will Allan do?  This clumsy, awkward and very neurotic man cannot be himself around any woman, once he has a romantic interest in her.  Linda is the one woman he feels he can really be himself with.<br /><br />This film runs parallel to the plot of CASABLANCA.  For those of you who have seen it, you know what happens.  For those of you who haven't, I won't ruin the story......you'll just have to see it.  This is goofy slapstick and classic Woody Allen.  Check it out......
B000001FTD|3.0|First off let me start by saying I'm a huge Metal fan and am quite fond of thrash. I listen to Bands like Megadeth, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Testament, Judas Priest, Sepultura and Black Sabbath on a regular basis. After listening to this album I can't honestly figure out why Anthrax are considered to be in the big four, on par with the likes of Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth. It drives me mad. While some of the songs on here are pretty good, like the best track, the entertaining energetic \\"Caught in A Mosh,\\" none of the tracks are on par with great thrash classics like Holy Wars...The Punishment Due, Raining Blood, or Battery. I know most metal vocalists suck, paticuarily thrash vocalists but Belladonna sticks out like a sore thumb in this band, because even though he's an acceptable singer, he sounds like he should be in a hair band not a thrash band like anthrax. The riffs are quite solid, with some such as the intro riff to \\"Imitation of Life\\" being one of the greatest thrash riffs ever, the band fail when it comes to writing solos. Sure people complain about kerry king and Jeff Hanneman of Slayer but I can assure you that Dan Spitz's solos are a lot worse and all sound exactly the same and have no energy. Charlie Bentante is an ok drummer, but he fails when compared to good thrash drummers like Dave lombardo, Gene Hoglan, Nick Menza and Lars Ulrich. And many of these songs are quite boring to tell the truth. In fact 3 stars is surely overly generous for this record but I do sort of like the bands lighthearded lyrics which contrast nicely to other metal bands constant rants about how the world sucks but it doesn't save the fact that there were better non-big four thrash bands significantly better than this, like Testament, Dark Angel and Sepultura. In paticular I think Testament should be part of the big four over Anthrax, there songs are a lot more memorable, their vocalist is better and the guitarist, alex skolnick writes jazz fusion solos that never fail to impress. On the other hand Anthrax mostly writes boring songs with boring solos. This stuff is absolutely dated; any people getting into thrash should absolutely avoid Anthrax and spend their time with better thrash bands like Metallica (1st 4 records), Slayer (all records but undisputed attitude), Megadeth (Killing is my business, Peace Sells and especially Rust in Peace), Testament (all but Demonic), Sepultura (Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise, Chaos A.D), Dark Angel (Darkness Descends), and Exodus (Bonded by Blood). Avoid overrated dated stuff like this and buy the stuff above as you can save your money and have a lot more fun listening to good thrash.
0743298020|5.0|WOW what a read, this will become a classic! I fell into this book and never wanted to leave. I will not give many details of the read, but I have to tell you that this book was beautifully suspensful.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I remember rating this album a while back one star. Thats when I was still ignorant and didn't understand what good metal was. This is one of the greatest metal albums ever and is probably the best thrash album ever. The one thing one must remember with this album is, unless you listen to a lot of extreme metal on a regular basis, you will not be able to like this record on the first few listens. Once you listen to it a bunch of times it will actually grow on you, you will find that these songs all have memorable hooks underneath the chaos! Take for instance the opener Angel of Death. On first listen it sounds like just noise, but after several listens the awesomeness of it comes out, how the intense thrashing intro leads into the sick grooving midsection complete with an awesome riff to boot, followed by a barrage of five back to back shredding solos. Awesome. The eight songs in between Raining blood are all similar yet, with the exception of reborn are all excellent. Each of these songs, despite their brevity have small but definite musical hooks that discern each track from one another. Raining Blood finishes off this record, and is an absolutely amazing song, its riff is arguably the most memorable metal riff ever. Everything about this record is awesome from the Gruff but clear vocals, the machine gun drumming, the rapid riffery and insane atonal soloing (not technically the best but fits the album perfectly) and the sick twisted lyrics. Just give this record time because it will grow on you. And believe the hype. It's as great as everyone says it is
B00000I07P|4.0|I loved this album.  It came out when I was about 12.  I guess that's the only time I could enjoy the album.   <br />Bon Jovi seems incapable of writing lyrics that amount to anything other than a string of cliches.   <br />This album can really only be appreciated by those of us who were young when it was popular.
B000002IMG|4.0|This is a very good record, and confirms why Testament should be in the big four of thrash in place of Anthrax. The vocals and guitars are meld to create a classic thrash album. The songwriting on here is fairly solid, and there are plenty of memorable songs. The intro song is a great example, after leading off with a winding baroque sounding solo, the song kicks into a great classic thrash stomp with great vocals a memorable chorus and another thrashtastic solo. What more can you want. Songs like Into the Pit, Eerie Inhabitants, Disciples of The Watch, Trial By Fire and the title track are all solid excellent thrashers. Even more the bands cover of Aerosmith's Nobody's fault is BETTER than the origional and is very good along with the beautiful instrumental. The album does have some filler in Day of Reckoning and The Preacher but overall its a solid thrash record that can be comfortably mentioned in the list of top 10 thrash albums ever. Very good. Maybe not essential if you only want a few thrash records to listen to but its still great.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Reasonably well-acted.  Poorly photographed.  Very poorly written.  Hard to understand how a turkey like this can get all those nominations.  Must have something to do with industry politics.  Not worth buying.
1402720602|5.0|The author starts the budding luthier with the construction of molds and jigs. The order in which this is presented is excellent: by the time you get to the construction of the solera, you should be quite proficient at cutting the outline of the guitar in MDF (medium density fiberboard) with a 14\\" band saw. My solera turned out very well. A note on materials: John notes that the material for the molds will require two 4' x 8' sheets of 3/4\\" MDF and 1/2 of a 4' x 8' sheet of 1/2\\" MDF. 4' x 8' sheets of MDF are VERY HEAVY and impossible to work with in a small shop. I purchased 2' x 4' sheets instead and the results were great. Also, a 2' x 4' sheet 5/8\\" thick should be substituted for one of the 3/4\\" sheets, for the lining bender jig. This will save a bit of planing.    One should note the typo on page 51: under \\"Cutting the Pieces,\\" \\"10 inches wide and 20 inches long\\" should be \\"10 inches wide and 24 inches long.\\" On page 58 where John specifies \\"six pieces 24 1/2 inches x 10 1/2 inches,\\" pieces only 24\\" x 10 1/2\\" will do very well. The plan for the caul on page 123 is missing. The author says it was accidentally cut out of the book, and he wrote, \\"The laminations are masonite thinned down to about .090 to make them easier to bend. I use about four of them. The outer one has sixteen pieces of 3/4 MDF glued from top to bottom along the length as shown on page 123. The pieces that go over rounded areas must be shaped to fit flat on their entire surface.\\"    The author will offer printed plans for the guitar at some point in the future.    Overall a very nice book. I've just finished bending the sides according to John's instructions and I look forward to the next steps in this very interesting project.
B000M4RG42|3.0|The book was excellent. The movie messes with the book big time.  The book was pretty much linear in chronology.  The movie jumps back and forth in time like crazy.  Hard to understand the point - just confusing.
0553804367|5.0|A very good book for those who want to develop insight and understanding of the fundamentals in cosmology. Pedagogically and didactically is a great value for the average science buff.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Episode after episode, Medium delivers. Because I had parents who were both mediums -- the authentic, useful to the police kind -- I am always skeptical about TV and movie portrayals. They always seem to miss the mark. But this series really captures me with its authentic and human approach. Then there's the astute dialog, the top-notch acting, and all the family sub-plots that keep things cooking episode after episode. Allison and Joe come across like a real married couple, real parents with real kids. The balance between home life, mediumship and crime solving keeps me coming back, over and over. This DVD set has a highly favored status in my collection.
0312287550|2.0|A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next.  This is not one of those stories.  It's not a bad book by any means.  Shining moments appear.  However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize.  All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity.  Did I mention it's predictable?  You should have expected that. <br /> <br />Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead.  This is Soap Opera history.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I saw this in the theater, and came out of it crunching numbers, trying to figure out how I could afford to trade my paid-off Subaru in on a new hybrid. <br /> <br />I also came out of it wondering if we are going to all wake up in time to save the planet, or if we are going to just keep snoozing along until Greenland melts and Manhattan becomes the new Venice. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this, I realize how difficult it is to imagine that a powerpoint presentation by Al Gore on climate change could be riveting - but if that's the case, then why is this film creating so much buzz?  The only way to find out, is to see it yourself.  Buy this now, and get ready to be a part of the coming revolution.
0307237699|5.0|So many books are available now on what to do or how to change America, one gets lost on what to buy and whom to believe. The Amazon discounted price for \\"The Audacity Of Hope\\" is worth every penny even if it sold for four times as much. Senator Obama explains how to bring this divided country back together...in layman's terms. His flow of words is that of a great orator. No doubt the book was written for the American voter to get to know him. I feel as though I DID get to know him and I will work tooth and nail, day and night, to help him get elected. His 'audacity of hope' is awe-inspiring because it gave me hope...something I, and millions of others have been needing during the past six years under the worst political adminstration in United States history. The book is well worth the price and certainly worth the time it takes to read it!!!
0553801503|5.0|The series is divided laregly into two parts The North or Ice, and The South or Fire. In the previous books Martin had written fairly equally about both sides, however A Feast for Crows, focuses more on the South as the plot thickens. Still the book remains as captivating as the other three, and leaves you thirsting for more, can't wait for A dnace with Dragons.
B000J103YI|5.0|Loved the movie, so of course, I love the soundtrack.  Jennifer Hudson's cuts, as well as her performance, stole the show, but Eddie Murphy's ballads are beautiful.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|Great hits album by U2, definately a must have in your music library.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|Whenever I think of Peter Pan, the first thing that comes to my mind is the Disney animated version of the timeless story of the boy who never grows up. Like with past classic Disney animated films, \\"Peter Pan\\" receives its own platinum edition (translation: two discs packed with goodies like behind the scenes footage, lost footage, games and music). The bonus disc is great. I especially dug the Making of Peter Pan and why Walt Disney had to make Peter Pan. Fascinating material.<br /><br />The story of Peter Pan was created by James Matthew Barrie. Anyone who have seen 2004's \\"Finding Neverland\\" would know that the inspiration behind the film was his muses were five young boys. The story of the Disney film begins with Wendy and her two brothers John and Michael. Wendy had somehow got a hold of Peter Pan's shadow with hopes that Pan would someday come get it so she can meet him. Peter Pan and his traveling companion Tinkerbell do come. Peter invites the trio to Neverland and the results is non-stop adventure involving the lost boys, Captain Hook, and a crocodile with an alarm clock inside its stomach.<br /><br />It's nice to see the animation had been cleaned up. The vibrant colors really comes through in this new version of \\"Peter Pan\\". What I wasn't too terribly keen on was the music. I found the songs syrupy or too cheesy for my liking but I suppose that is because I am an adult. Young children might like them. I could hardly care less about the games but again kids will more likely enjoy them than adults would. Overall I'm glad to see that \\"Peter Pan\\" is given a platinum edition. This is a classic.
B0002B55WA|4.0|Despite the usual panning of this movie, I found it to be hilarious and made for people who just want to relax their minds and float upstream. Not technically great but c'mon, it's the Beatles.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|There's so much tension in this movie it made me antsy! I love Jack Nicholson's expressions, they go so well with the roles he plays. He knows just how to get inside any character he portrays. Many scenes are messy, but extremely well done as far as plot and suspense. It wasn't the ending I'd hoped for, but I like the unexpected if it makes sense, and it did. The screenplay is tightly written with all loose ends tied up, which is wonderful because I hate the 'ambiguity' in endings, though there are more and more of them. I detest 'open endings' with thrillers especially, so I'm pleased these writers didn't try it.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0679731725|5.0|Kazuo Ishiguro once said of his desire to write: \\"I'm always trying to remind myself that while we may be very pleased with ourselves, we may one day look back with a different perspective and ask whether we may have acted out of cowardice or failure of vision. What I'm interested in is not the actual fact that my characters have done things they later regret. I'm interested in how they come to terms with it.\\"<br /><br />To me the above is a great description of what's going on in The Remains of the Day: Mr Stevens, a repressed butler in post-WWII England, is forced near the end of his career to reexamine his entire life. Although there are certainly a number of interesting subplots that kept me reading, the central action of the story revolves around his attempts to salvage for himself some of the 'dignity' and 'greatness' and 'satisfaction' that he had, until recently, been so sure he'd achieved over the years.<br /><br />That being so, I read the book primarily as an exploration of regret, although it had some darkly funny moments too. Often, for instance, Mr Stevens will misinterpret what's happening around him or repress his feelings to such an extent that it's almost humorous - except for the fact that he's making happiness impossible for himself. Overall, the first couple of chapters took a bit of patience as I got to know Mr Stevens, but by the end of the story he had become one of my all-time favorite fictional characters. Recommended  to anyone who's in the mood for thoughtful, character-driven fiction.
B000M4RG42|5.0|It's hard to imagine so much emotion being packed into a photo, but this movie shows the depth to which we tie ourselves to an image, especially during a war. The connection between the photo and the actual battle digs under the heroic image of men raising a flag at Iwo Jima in 1945 to the underlying pain and horrors that the war leaves behind, staining the memories of the men who lived through it. This film will touch you at the core of your humanity! There are no illusions in the story of it being a 'good war', because the truth is all wars are destructive in such huge proportions, though often deemed 'necessary'. The realization that something is considered a 'good fight' is sometimes missing the truth; that war damages everything in its wake, causing one to wonder how the word 'good' and 'war' could've ever been paired at all. Poignant film!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B00005B1W5|5.0|I was raised listening to all genres of music from country to rock and roll, Beatles to Henry Mancini.  I attribute my love of music to my mother who always had music playing in our home.  This dvd is one of the most captivating music experiences that I can recall.  The talent of the musicians who travel with Yanni is extraordinary to say the least!  What an incredible group of master musicians! They are truly enjoying what they do!  It's powerful, beautiful,romantic,and fun!  You'll watch this over and over!
0783225725|5.0|One of my favorite Eastwood westerns that I come back to often because it's so very good. A town with an ugly secret sees a nameless drifter as a blessing that will help rid them of bad guys let out of jail and on their way to get revenge on the townspeople. But is the nameless drifter an angel sent to save them, or the devil sent to make them pay for the evil deed they've done? It'll keep your eyes glued to the screen.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

1582701709|5.0|Amazing, will read it more than once. Expands on the video and things I missed in scenes from the video are explained in the book. A great companion to the video or just a great stand alone book. Well worth it.
B0000640VN|4.0|Duke Leopold might go onto invent the elevator. He might go onto get married to a New York heiress. He also might not. Stuart, a fourth dimension hobbyist has accidentally taken him through time to 21st century New York, back to his flat above his ex-girfriend Kate. Without the Duke, there are no elevators, and in a world with tall buildings, this is trouble. Stuart is determined to put Leopold back, but he ends up getting put in hospital. Leopold is left on his own, and gets a job in commercials for Kate. Being a Duke, he's well spoken and dressed. It charms not just the camereas... <br /> <br />Worth a look. Twist of sci-fi here. It's entertaining enough. Hugh Jackman (Leopold) & Breckin Meyer (Brother of Kate) have a pretty interesting dynamic, my favorite scenes had them in it together.
B000IOM0YM|2.0|If you are looking for a quality sound and picture concert of KISS this aint it. Being a very big KISS fan I was somewhat diappointed to see some in black & white. Some of the footage looked more like a bootleg than a quality dvd. Anyway I am still waiting for one great concert, in color, with great sound quality and picture quality. I remember years ago seeing a concert on Directv. I would sure like to get my hands on that one in remastered dvd quality. Very disappointed in this dvd myself.
0800141601|4.0|\\"First Knight\\" takes concepts from King Arthur mythology to tell a story around some costumes and beautiful scenery. More about scenery and script than anything else. It's stripped down in terms of fantasy, but I liked it. Sean Connery's King Arthur is warmly done, and Richard Gere's Lancelot is pretty likeable. Queen Guinevere, though, I find a bit hard to understand. She's in a fair bit of denial through the film.
0767817710|4.0|I think that line (spoken by a crowd of evil children before they beat up an unarmed, chained Russell Crowe) sums up the movie well. This movie does an excellent job of communicating the sheer GLEE of sadism. Everyone in this movie (with the partial exceptions of Stone and Crowe) don't just like to inflict pain on others - it gives them physical PLEASURE. They cackle and quip and snicker and guffaw as they blast enormous, ragged, bleeding holes into people. This is an excellent (if somewhat garish and comic-bookish) look at an evil that has infected a whole town. Imagine Eastwood's more sinister and sometimes turgid attempts (High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven come to mind), but with a wink and a sense of humor. More slow-mo than the Olympics. Pioneered the bullet cam that has since been done to death. Ms Stone shows a lot of leg. So, it's got a lot going for it is what I'm saying.
0618680004|5.0|A scientific approach to religion--Dawkins cannot be argued with (although many try!). A book for all rational-minded individuals who are concerned about the state of the world. Religion should be debated, just like politics or any other subject. I \\"have faith\\" that Dawkins can help push the evolution of all human brains to higher levels.
B000002513|5.0|Before Bruce Springsteen crashed onto the national scene (cover of Time and Newsweek in the same week), he had played with local bands for several years in his native New Jersey and had released two albums, \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\" in 1972 and this album one year later.  We wore the grooves off both at the University of Delaware from 1972-1976.  More than 30 years later, \\"The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle\\" remains one of my all-time favorite albums.<br /><br />\\"E Street\\" is an infectious blend of rock, blues, and jazz, in fact more jazz than would appear on the rest of his albums put together, as producer Jon Landau, who took over with \\"Born to Run\\", and Bruce himself would adopt a tighter, more structured style.<br /><br />For me, \\"E Street\\" contains three great songs--the plaintive \\"Sandy\\" (\\"Sandy, that waitress I've been seeing lost her desire for me\\"), the evocative, Romeo and Juliet-tinged \\"Incident on 57th Street\\" (always \\"Spanish Johnny\\" to me--\\"good night, it's all right Jane\\"), and the anthemic \\"Rosalita\\" (\\"my machine she's a dud, I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey\\"), the song I'd ask to hear if I could hear just one more rock song before I go.  The piano segue between these last two is a musical thing of beauty.<br /><br />\\"Wild Billy's Circus Story\\" (with the unexpected appearance of a tuba) and \\"Listen to Your Junkman\\" (which I'm sure goes by another title, but that's how I remember it, having listened many more times than I've read the liner notes) are also outstanding, but grow on the listener moreso than blowing his or her doors off the first time.  The \\"title\\" track \\"E Street Shuffle\\" introduces the show in a rush.<br /><br />Springsteen fans who discovered him in the mid-80s with \\"Born in the USA\\" should definitely treat themselves to this early masterpiece.
B00005R23S|5.0|This concert, shot for HBO, was just a phenominal concert.  Great to see Little Steven back with the band, even though his voice makes my head hurt.  Amazon got me the video very quickly, the prompt service I've come to expect to Amazon and most of their affiliates.  Thanks Amazon, I'm well pleased again!
0743289684|5.0|Autobiographies often suffer from late-life authorship--a time when the fires are damped and the events foreshortened by time.   This one--by a woman still in her thirties--is an exception to nearly every rule of the genre.  Not least for its electrifying readability: it consumed every free moment of the two days it took to finish it.  Putting it down was simply not an option. <br /> <br />This book will grab your imagination like no other, transplant you into a world you have probably never known, and introduce you to the intimate world of a muslim family swept by circumstance all over Africa, Arabia, and Europe.  The complex interaction of tribes, clans, cultures, extended families and nations (and their consequences) isn't dryly analyzed, it is woven into a personal drama with the momentum of a locomotive.  The love of family rides perilously over the jarring railbed of refugee life, of ancient and modern Islamic conflicts, all of it recounted with real compassion in beautifully clear English.  This multilingual immigrant needs no ghostwriter. <br /> <br />Unlike the collection of editorial essays which comprised \\"The Caged Virgin\\", \\"Infidel\\" is a consistently focused narrative of a spectacularly eventful life launched almost inadvertantly into an unparalleled adventure in moral courage.  But there's far more here than a clash-of-cultures story well told.  There is no targeted rush toward a predestined liberation.  The revelatory discovery of western freedoms comes late in the book and gathers like a slow-motion sunrise.  Only in the final chapters does she defect from Muslim culture, graduate from the University of Leiden, become a Dutch legislator, a target of Islamic terrorists, and an incendiary revolutionary for Muslim womens' rights. <br /> <br />More than simply discovering western libertarian values, she shows a deep and critical understanding of their history, how they've shaped the modern world, and shows their prognosis for dealing with the festering problem of Europe's Islamic subculture.  Her extraordinary life seems more an ongoing work in progress than a settled iconographic career.  She has recently moved to America--the adopted home of another famously eloquent and consequential revolutionary: Tom Paine.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|Im an Iron Man fanatic, and HAD to have this DVD as soon as it was released.  The second it arrived it was in my player and playing.  All I can say for it was WOW!!  It had a real interesting plot, and the actual picture and colors were great!! <br /> <br />
0307237699|5.0|Once again Obama has come through with a classic piece of writing both in content and writing style. Presents a very challenging way of dealing with the extreme dichotomy of political/religious/economic/social views in the USA today.  In some ways, this is a very scary book in that it touches repeatedly on what will happen if we don't wake up as Americans and get some consensus and make the necessary changes in our society to allow it to have a future.
B00000F1D3|4.0|I bought this CD today at the store.  I really like some of the songs, and I don't like some of the others.  This is my first Cher CD so I'm not a fan or anything, in fact I don't particularly know about her much at all.  But this is a good CD.  I bought it for $3.99 used, and I think that's what it's worth.  It's certainly not worth $14.99.  If you can get it for a cheap price and you like, disco/electric music, then I think you'll like it.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|The idea is decent, the ending is sound, and Keanu Reeves plays his character in a way that reminds me of Agent Smith in the Matrix. I would give Constantine two thumbs up if Rachel Weisz and Tida Swinton had made it together, but that's just me. Since they didn't, it's a decent flick. <br /> <br />Lower your expectations, have a few beers and enjoy. <br />
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I haven't seen the musical, but have the soundtrack to it. I think this movie is a faithful rendition of the musical. The video transfer is great quality, the colors are fantastic! There were some jerky frames at the beginning for some reason. The audio is also excellent. Great dynamic range and clarity. I highly recommend this disc!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I waited a long time to see this because everyone I know didn't like it, as it relates to the first two films. When I finally gave in, I wasn't expecting much (my sure fire method of getting more out of a film), so I appreciated it more than I expected...plus Jada Pickett-Smith is hot. However, the ending needed a little more resolution, considering the monumental storyline. <br /> <br />Lower your expectations, have a few beers, and watch all three films in a row. <br />
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Pleasantly surprised that this album was as well done as the first one.  It might even be better!  Great voice, great choice of songs.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is a dark, brooding movie, yet Natalie Portman is beautiful and amazing, even against the dark world of this story. Produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski of the Matrix Trilogy, and based on a graphic novel (adult comic book), V for Vendetta is a big budget, well produced, beautifully dark film with wonderful texture and darker, heartfelt themes. I saw many parallels between the Fascist Britain of this film and some of the western powers of the here and now. There are multiple facets happening in this film. Some viewers will take away one, some will take away a few more, and still some others will take away many.  <br /> <br />As usual, my recommendation is to lower your expectations, have a few beers, and view this film with an open mind. You'll get more out of the experience if you do. <br />

B000ICLHIE|2.0|Look, I'm a Tom Waits fan, but most of this album was pretty inaccessible to me.   When you get to a certain level as a musician and song writer you get to do an album like this because your recording label probably has to let you.   Tom has probably wanted to do this for a long time,  but I think he is mostly talking  (muttering actually) to himself here.  If you are really, really, really into his work this may be signature stuff, but I think most people will not be able to get much from this. <br /> <br />I don't regret buying it, because I like to look into his pretty amazing head, and if you have a copy it will no doubt be a collector's item in 20 years---but it will be because you will be one of only a few dozen owners.
B0007KTAU4|1.0|I listen to a whole lot of French albums from many talented French artists. I'm not sure how i came across Carla Bruni. I listened to her album, and personally, i didn't get anything out of this. She has a lovely voice, but it's nothing special, and sometimes I felt that it gets bland after the first few songs. And the music itself is just too dull. Don't assume that jazz is not my taste, i love jazz/blues music, but this to me was just dull for the most part.
B0000669JL|5.0|Perhaps the finest reggae album of all time -- easy listening, takes you right to Jamaica.  If you haven't tried out this album, what are you waiting for...my kids now sing along to \\"Buffalo Soldier.\\"
B000J10ERO|5.0|Despite the fact that I spent way too much time on IMDB reading spoilers for this movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly when I saw it in a theatre and even more the other two times I saw it. Singer effectively showed both the strapping, smiling public face of Superman as well as his troubled private life which was a result of his absence and also the fact that he can never be like everyone else. <br /> <br />The last 15 minutes were too maudlin for my taste, nevertheless, the movie did everything I hoped it would. It paid tribute to the Christopher Reeve movie that I loved as a kid, added menace to Lex Luthor and unapologetically ramped up Superman's powers. <br /> <br />A great movie, and the behind the scene feature was highly entertaining as well thanks to Singer giving us full access and chiming in from time to time as well.
0743270754|5.0|Our 16th president could not have avoided greatness.  Oh for the likes of him in todays pols.  His ability to move people, even his detrackers, into his camp and make them fast friends makes this account of his life a most remarkable story.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Gore makes his case beautifully in this justly lauded documentary. The facts that he so soberly and calmly lays out, build inexorably to their disturbing and scarifying conclusion. Global warming is real, folks, time to get up off our arses and do something about it. And, as the psychologists say, the first step is to admit you have a problem.  <br /> <br />Well done, Al, extremely well done.
B000IHY9T8|5.0|Great album with great hit but a few aren't so good. Editing Fine (in Jimmy Crack Corn, lets in S*** but only twice. It does not sound like S*** so it does not matter). Here's what I think about the songs. <br /> <br />Shady Narcotics : nothing to say really, just an intro. <br /> <br />We're Back : 9/10 : Great Song <br /> <br />Pistol Pistol : 8/10 : Has good music <br /> <br />Murder : 6/10 : could of been better but Bizzare does not have a good rapping voice. <br /> <br />Everything is Shady : 5/10 : Just not a good song. <br /> <br />The Re-Up : 10 : Cool Beat <br /> <br />You Don't Know : 10 : Another great song. <br /> <br />Jimmy Crack Corn : 7/10 : A Pointless Song. <br /> <br />The rest are not good until you get to By My Side. <br /> <br />By My Side : 10 : Well Done Stat Quo. <br /> <br />The rest isn't good until you get to smack that (Remix). <br /> <br />Smack That (Remix) : 9/10 : Great new Lyrics. <br /> <br />Public Enimy #1 : 8/10 : Pointlessly Good <br /> <br />The rest isn't good until you get to Shake That (Remix) <br /> <br />Shake That (Remix) : 10/10 : Bobby Creekwater did well in the 1st verse. <br /> <br />Cry Now : 8/10 : Good Song <br /> <br />No Appoligies : 10/10 : AMAZING, Great slow and steady beat. <br /> <br />    GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />Edited version is not too sensitive which is good. <br /> <br /> <br />
0618680004|5.0|I've seen a lot of good criticism and praise for this book in these reviews but please make sure you've read the book before writing something  SCOUT from Virginia writes one sentence and has made it obvious that they have never opened the book.  Dawkins does NOT say that science proves there is no god, he says it is VERY UNLIKELY.  Of course science can't prove their is no god and any moderately intelligent person sees that.   <br />I really liked reading this book and definitely recommend it to people whether you are religious or not.  Like political books, you must read both sides in order to make informed arguments.
1400034779|5.0|I agree with many that this novel shouldn't be catagorized as mystery.  It is far too literary to be pure mystery.   Since finishing the book, it has taken me a while to decide whether I liked it or not.  This is my favorite type of book, one that doesn't leave me at the last page, but forces me to think about it long after.
B000ME5B30|1.0|This movie is a bunch of BS!  Somehow Al Gore has become scientist and knows more about a topic that most scientists cant even agree on.  To think that humans are the main cause for global warming is a bit arrogant, ask any true meteorologist about what they think of this crappy fairytale.<br /><br />The Inconvenient Truth is the fact that this movie costs you too much, and that Global Warming is a natural cycle with many causes, the sun being the major one. Do your research before you decide to fall for this \\"Mockumentary\\"<br /><br />Someone ask Al Gore how he gets to all his book signings and publicity stunts, I suspect by planes or Helicopter, which burn \\"harmful Fuels\\"  Can anyone say Hypocrite? Personally I don't care how he gets there, but these people spout this nonsense and don't follow what they preach.
0156421178|4.0|George Orwell was one of the century's most honest, decent, and lucid writers about the human element in warfare and poltical revolution. His antitotalitarian novels \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984,\\" which made him famous, grew partly from his acute understanding of the events of World War II and partly from his personal experiences as a Loyalist volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, which is the subject of \\"Homage to Catalonia.\\" <br /> <br />Orwell was a Marxist-Leninist in the 1930s, sufficiently committed to risk his own life in battle to help bring about a people's revolution in Spain. This memoir, written in 1937-38 while the war was still on, records how his idealism was battered by the cynical, pro-USSR politics he saw betray the Marxist ideal on the one hand, and the irreducible practicality of most ordinary people that makes it an impossible dream on the other.  In the process, Orwell's contempt for the low standards of news-media accuracy only increased. Fans of Fox and CNN, take note. <br /> <br />By 1947 Orwell, the Marxist idealist, had become convinced that despite all their shortcomings and failures, the liberal Western democracies had developed the best form of political governance yet possible. Since the 1930s, one might observe, a leavening of socialist thought in these nations has brought about societies that are closer to Marx's egalitarian goals than the inflexible, authoritarian regimes that he directly inspired.  The good intentions of \\"people's revolutions\\" are sure to be betrayed by the most ruthless leaders and factions they create. For every socioeconomic wrong they correct, such revolutions inevitably create many more of their own, totalitarian control and denial of due process being among the worst.  <br /> <br />\\"Homage to Catalonia,\\" written at the moment of Orwell's complete break with the Leninist variety of Marxism, is a model of fair-minded reporting. Anyone interested in the Spanish Civil War, the '30s, revolutionary politics, or even \\"ForWhom the Bell Tolls,\\" should read this book. <br /> <br />As somebody else mentioned, the fine recent movie \\"Land and Freedom\\" takes its inspiration from Orwell's book and ought to be watched in conjunction with it.  Though fitted out with an imaginary love story, it is completely faithful to Orwell's spirit in \\"Homage to Catalonia.\\"
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Not being a huge Metallica fan I wasn't sure what I would get with this DVD. Obviously I enjoy enough of their music to take a chance on this.  Hey the concept of a head banger band combined with a symphony was very intriguing.  And it delivered far more than I ever imagined.  Having played in a symphony for 5 years during my school days -- I was more than a little concerned about the symphony's arrangement and hoped that Metallica wouldnt just drown them out.  Michael Kamen (or whomever) was masterful in blending the symphony together with the metal to provide a very robust and rich sound.  And the band doesnt overpower the symphony at all. As a metal head banger I was also worried that they would produce a milk toast or watered down version of Metallica -- again no worries mate!  Metallica sounds great and the symphony adds an amazing texture to them.  The DVD visually is very well done -- cameras transition from musician to musician and angle to angle in a coheisive fashion so that the viewer feels like part of the performance or at least being part of the front row.  All parties appear to be enjoying themselves tremendously - which makes viewing the DVD even more fun.  If you like Metallica you wont be disappointed and if you're just a casual fan but love music you'll enjoy this one too.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Craig has made a great start and thus expectations are going to be high for his next Bond film. Casino Royale was an excellent movie with a plot that reminded me the earlier Bond films and that made it more enjoyable to watch. The Blu-Ray edition should be a spectacular one and prove to us that the investment that we made in HDTV and Blu-Ray was well worth the money paid.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I had already bought and listened to the Let GO CD several times.  It reflected the young 17 year old singing it but I still liked it very much.  Avril's \\"Under My Skin\\" showed a lot of maturity for the 19 year old.  Under My Skin was more rock & Roll then Pop music.  I am looking forward to Avril's new CD \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" coming out in April of 2007 and hope for more maturity.  From what I understand the new CD is more pop and punk, hope it's at least equal to her first two CD's
B000ME5B30|5.0|I thought this was a factual, yet optimistic documentary.  It gives a scientific outlook on global warming that you don't have to be a scientist to understand.  Above all, it sends the message that we can still change the outcome of global warming.   <br /> <br />For those commenting on how Gore is magically a scientist, if you take a look at his biography you're right, he's not.  But before he was a politician he was a journalist and wrote a book called \\"Earth in the Balance\\" while he was a senator.  His knowledge is not shoddy, he did his research in making this film.  And if you need to double check that this movie is science and not a political opinion, Wiki Scientific Opinion on Climate Change. <br />
6304907648|5.0|I love this movie. It's creepy and mysterious and suspensfull. If you are into Serial Killer flicks this is a must see and a good addition to your collection.  It's an older movie so it was very hard to find. In fact I checked in every store in my city first and no one had it so I was thrilled that I could not only purchase it but New and on DVD, at a reasonable price too. <br />
0757302661|4.0|This book was extremely helpful.  It gave me different relaxation techniques.  I didn't work with a hypotherapist or anything but I found that I could pick and choose what would work for me.  Don't beleive is when it says that without fear there will be no pain because there definately is but you can work through it with the technique and a great partner to help you focus.  Good luck!
B000068PQ0|5.0|Never heard of the Flaming Lips, one of rock's most unusual acts hailing from of all places, Oklahoma City, OK? Unbelievably, the band is nearing their 25Th anniversary. Their career is a long storied one, filled with bizarre tales, wildly ambitious projects, and a decent turnover of musicians. The band's sound certainly has changed over the years. While front man and co-founder, Wayne Coyne, says that the Lips are in their final incarnation, that doesn't mean that their genius won't continue on. Wayne, Steven Drozd, and Michael Ivins still have alot to say and they keep finding the most fascinating ways to say it. One could buy any one of the last three lips albums, \\"Yoshimi,\\" \\"The Soft Bulletin,\\" and 2006's effort \\"At War With the Mystics,\\" and have an excellent album on their hands. I'm particularly fond of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.     The Lips music blends addictive pop sensibility, smart earnest lyrics, with a huge assortment of sounds. The music is at the same time overtly psychedelic and tenderly melodic, without ever being abrasive or unfocused. While all the Lips albums are in a sense concept albums, Yoshimi's story and sound could be the most cohesive. It's easy to suggest 911 played a role in the subtext of this album. The same goes for the Iraq war in the equally brilliant \\"At War with the Mystics.\\" Both albums, despite employing a political subtext, are irresistably catchy. If you've never heard the Lips, Yoshimi's first three songs might be best thing you've heard in years. The story of Yoshimi starts to become more abstract after Pt 2 but the remaining songs are nothing short of genius. One particular highlight is \\"Do You Realize.\\" The orchestral sound combined with simple, off the cuff, yet surprisingly poignant and heartfelt lyrics is like a dose of the sweetest most heavenly gooseberry pie you'll ever taste. No really. Do You Realize doesn't ask as much from its audience as say, \\"Imagine,\\" but its bittersweet message is just as grandious.In a nutshell, The Lips are making some of the most breathtaking music around. If you haven't heard their stuff or seen one of their legendary shows you're missing out big time. Pick it up, the whole family will love the Flaming Lips. I Promise!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Mr. Mayer you did a fine piece of work and I am here to applaude you. This album is powerful yet, simple. The whole CD has a nice even flow to it so you can get your vibe on yet, every song has its own distinct great sound. Real smooth John. I like to kind of consider myself a 22 year old conoseur of blues. Mostly dealing in the likelyhood of Stevie Ray Vaughan (RIP- we love you)with a lot a bit of Jimi Hendrix. <br />And those are pretty much my backbones along with Led Zeppelin who are just wonderful. So to sum it up in a summary that I will summarize for you;   after listning to the CD two complete times with a clear mind in tact, only then should you give your first opinion. #2 After you take out all the external stimuli and you still don't like this CD very strongly; you're CrAzY!!!!
B000068FUS|5.0|The Truckers are simply one of the worlds most criminally under appreciated bands.  Southern Rock Opera is nothing short of an American masterpiece.  It's the Truckers magnificent opus that marks the change from a smart but ultimately campy southern rock group into a southern rock group of rare emotional depth, intelligence, and diversity.   <br /> <br />Southern Rock Opera is not exactly an opera.  It's more of a concept album--part history lesson, part autobiography, part fiction that loosely follows a character with dreams of becoming a rock star.  It explores his musical ambition and sense of identity, beginning in high school all the way up to a tragic ending mirroring the fate of one of his musical idols, Ronnie Van Zandt of Lynyrd Skynyrd.   <br /> <br />Along the way he redicovers what it means to be from the South and regains his pride for his southern heritage.  Musically this is a hard rockin album that slow's down occasionally without ever sounding tired. It allows the listener to catch his breath and enjoy the variety between the bands primary two songwriters Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley.  The longtime friends and musical collaborators have in Southern Rock Opera a record to be immensly proud of.  Uncompromising, yet earthy and earnest, the album only kicks off a series of DBT records that follow, each one in their own right rock masterpieces.  After Southern Rock Opera the band went through some line up changes and added singer songwriter Jason Isbell.  Isbell's contributions have been incredibly important, adding yet another dynamic, one of an incredibly talented and soulful musician, to the already unique duality of Hood and Cooley.  The band followed Decoration Day with their equally powerful albums The Dirty South and 2006's Blessing and a Curse.  Truly a great rock n roll band of monumental proportions, it's a crying shame not more have been fortunate enough to hear them or have the guts to appreciate them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
1582701709|1.0|Isn't it time that we abandoned new-age psychobabble? Most people do not regard the earth as in fixed orbit, believe phrenology is accurate, or think Nessie is still swimming around in Scotland, so why continue to put money in the pockets of people trying to dupe the public? If I actually believe the junk espoused in this book, I would use my newfound powers of positive thought so that the universe exposed the authors for the frauds they are. In case anyone is not with me so far, astrology, feng shui, alien autopsies, creationism/intelligent design, scientology, and (most of all) The Secret are all pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo that should be abandoned for the shackles they put on the human mind. Books like The Secret are leading us back down the path to the Dark Ages where mysticism reigned and if you wanted to know something, you read it in an old mistake-ridden book rather than looking for yourself.<br /><br />The part of this fallacy that burns me most (other than the public eating this nonsense up), is the claim that \\"The law of attraction is the most powerful law in the universe.\\" WRONG! This has no scientific basis whatsoever and as far as science goes, there is no hierarchy of laws with one presiding over another. The only \\"Law of Attraction\\" I can think of is gravity, where if I throw an apple into the air it will come back down, whether I \\"will\\" it to or not. Even calling the \\"attraction hypothesis\\" a law is silly; no scientist will agree that what this book puts forth has undergone or could undergo rigorous scientific testing to elevate it to \\"law\\" status.<br /><br />In short, just because Oprah has been fooled by these charlatans doesn't mean you should too. If you really want to learn something about the laws of the universe, read something by Einstein or Sagan, or if it's spiritual fulfillment your after really seek it out in churches, temples, or wherever you might find it. The Secret merely stems from American materialism, trying to get what I want when I want it. Well guess what? The writers of the book wanted a lot of money so they wrote a book full of false hope and phoney promises, and if you bought this glorified doorstop then you helped them realize their dreams. We absolutely must be critical of scams like this one, and I am increasingly disheartened by the acceptance of pseudoscience and empty metaphysical promises so prevalent today.ant when I want it.

0553582445|5.0|I read the Assassin series many years ago and was afraid that I would be unable to pick up where it left off, while reading Fool's Errand.  I was mistaken.  Hobb takes a significant amount of time to bring the reader back to how Fitzchivalry came to be and how he has fared 15 years later.  She does it in a way that captivates the reader, without being tedious or repetitive.  Yes, it was a little slow in the beginning but the pace quickens and the reader is swept away into the Farseer saga once again.  I cannot wait to read the next book in the series!
B000008JUM|4.0|This collection of Cole Porter songs performed by different contemporary artists came out in the early 90's as a fundraiser to benefit AIDS research. <br /> <br />The artists have different styles, so you'll probably like some tracks much more than others.  I think they're uniformly good with some standouts, such as Annie Lennox's Everytime We Say Goodbye.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I love the old movies where everyone is well adjusted and beautifully dressed ,etc. but we know even in those days the family was just a collection of struggling individuals bound together by blood. Little Miss Sunshine shows the strength of that family bond and it is a surprise to them all when they pull (or push) together. It takes the innocence of the child to spark the love, sacrifice and forgiveness the characters experience. Grandpa exhibits the unconditional love for Olive that inspires the others to put their problems aside and support her as she does her very best at the Little Miss Sunshine Pagent. All the broken and desparate members of one family are redeemed and learn that loving one another is the only way in this imperfect world. Or you can try the Nine Steps.
B0002J4ZWS|4.0|I agree with following review by a fellow reviewer (see below)... and still like to give 4 stars for the entertainment value of it. It is a good movie after all. <br /> <br />Someone said.... <br /> <br />\\"Shawshank Redemption\\" is formulaic, dumbed-down Hollywood treacle. The heavy-handed Morgan Freeman voice-overs right away indicate that you're in for two hours of safe, sentimental mass-appeal entertainment devoid of any irony or intelligence.  <br /> <br />The movie's depiction of gays (the \\"Harpies\\" in the prison) as violent rapists out to defile decent heterosexual men needlessly promotes dangerous stereotypes.  <br /> <br />\\"Shawshank\\" isn't a horrible movie. It's just a mediocre one that doesn't belong even near any \\"Best Movies of All Time\\" lists. <br />
B000AARKOO|3.0|but I was bored up until the last 45 minutes. The final battle was great but up until then it was boring. They gloss over the small and intimate moments of the story so that just when you are getting relaxed the movie all of a sudden jerks you somewhere else. It isn't sloppy per say, I just like movies with a perfect mix of action and simple, intimate moments. Which I felt this movie glossed over. Gladiator and Troy are better examples of this. Some people think spending too much time on scenes like that is too scandalous and glamorous., but I disagree. This is not a horrible movie, good enough to rent and has great battle scenes but not a perfect movie overall.
B000001FI7|4.0|This album carries this deep vague element where you don't know and you don't bother yourself to know,you just sit there,listen and feel the music's cross over,it has this modern gothic sense,at times it's sensual and at times it's disturbing,and that's the secret of this album,in a way it portrays women's emotions through the beats and lyrics. It's more of the subconscious mind kicking in than the conscious mind. It's a slick album that awakens the senses,you don't skip the tracks,you simply let it play,you don't know which one or what kind or where from,like i said,you just listen...
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a film that will move you and entertanin you year after year. The acting is wonderful, Jimmy Stewart is at his best and the rest of the cast is definitely very good. The story is simple, but the screeplay is a mastepiece.  <br />You will cry and laugh and you will certainly be hooked and watch it every Christmas with your family.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is an elegant, dark riveting film. It is thought provoking on many levels and draws scary parellels of current events and close pssibilities. Anyone paying attention to our current Government/Media unpresidented level of current cooperation will get the point of this movie. It is told in terms of a grafic, gripping story performed by superb actors. I will be thinking of this film for a long time and have just purchased it. Bea.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|Great concert video. Almost all of their hits can be seen here. The sound is tremendous as is the video. I wish they did a double or triple CD version. I especially like the horns that are added to some old favorites.<br /><br /> A couple of minor nitpicks:<br /><br />1) I wish Joe Walsh would not act like a fool . Sometimes his behavior takes your attention away from his great guitar work.<br /><br />2) They force a few songs on you that aren't close to the classic material.\\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" , \\" No More Cloudy Days \\" and a couple of others could have been replaced by \\" Best of My Love \\" ( especially the great version that appears on Selected Works with the horns )or \\" My Thanksgiving \\" , \\"Seven Bridges Road\\" or \\"Doolin' Dalton\\".<br /><br />  This is a great product , don't get me wrong , but I would love to hear a little more . Maybe another live CD or DVD is on the way . I sure hope so.<br /><br /> P.S. This is better than \\"When Hell Freezes Over\\"
0374105235|5.0|As heartbreaking and depressing as was Ishmael Beah's kidnapping and forcible conscription as a child soldier in a by then pointless civil war, just as inspiring was his rescue and move to the United States where he attended school and now has the ability to tell his story to a wide audience.    Readers stand alongside Beah as in a matter of hours he goes from innocent child on his way to a talent show to a witness to human tragedy, watching mortally wounded neighbors fleeing rebel forces, observing a shocked mother cradling her child shot in the head, a father telling his dead child he would be okay.  From there Beah moves from witness to refugee to unwilling participant, as he is conscripted by sociopaths, drugged, and forced to fight in a war about which he knew nothing.    This excellent book draws much needed attention to the use of children in armed conflict.  It also reminds us that so much of what we have in our affluent society can be taken for granted.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Half Nelson writen partially and directed by Ryan Fleck is a great film. <br />I really enjoyed this film alot the classroom scenes were great especialy the civil rights scenes. The whole story line is  a good one because it is so real with the drug use and how it tears relationships apart and how people like goslins character come to terms and wake up to there addictions and get clean. I hope everyone who views thsi film gets alot out of it. This is what all independent films should be lie. I am not just saying that I enjoyed the movie just because Ryan Fleck is my Cousin I enjoyed it because it is trully great film making. <br />Jason Fleck
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I have always respected Al Gore and he merits accolades for this dire Documentary about the lurking ramifications of global warming. However, his solution is not enough. For example he does not address the massive land,air and water pollution that the beef, pork and poultry industries perpetrate and thereby exacerbate global warming. As a politician, Al Gore is an admirable environmentalist. But, if we really want to curtail global warming, we have to do more than use alternative sources of energy and fuel. We have to change our diets and vigilantly protect marine and terrestrial ecosytems, biodiversity, rainforests, coral reefs and put an end to deforestation. Gore only touched upon the tip of the iceberg. He still merits commendation for accentuating the issue.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you're a fan of science fiction & action movies, this one should be at the top of your wish-list.  It is quite an original and fresh sci fi adventure movie, basically a hybrid action & science fiction film.<br /><br />In this movie's representation, the future is pretty bleak & apocalyptic when compared with the utiopa-like vision of STAR TREK & other sci fi trademarks.  In this future, governments are as corrupt as they are today, only with a great deal more technology and means to suppress truth.  Anyone who tries to shine a spotlight on the lies of the government is labeled a traitor and a terrorist.<br /><br />In spite of these themes, the movie never seems to get \\"preachy\\" which is a good thing.  Rather, it is filled with some good action scenes and a compelling story of how difficult it is for a small band of character to try & \\"buck the system.\\"<br /><br />Above all else, SERENITY is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  It is, I believe, sure to become a cult classic in the years to come.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|this cd is awful.  i am disappointed in MCR for this.  3 cheers was such a better cd.  i think they choked on this one.  buy 3 cheers, and not this crappy release.
B00005JMJG|5.0|The premise of this story is quite fresh & original, I think.  Have you ever had a love affair with someone that went bad?  Have you ever wished that you could simply forget about it, so that you would no longer have to endure the pain?  Have you thought that life would be simpler & easier if you could move on without ever having to \\"look back\\"?<br /><br />The present film takes that concept & runs with it.  The title is an allusion to Alexander Pope and it refers to the \\"spotless mind\\" of someone who has been \\"wiped clean\\" of painful memories of love.  Thanx to a new technology, it is at last possible to kiss goodbye your recall of the proverbial \\"one that got away.\\"<br /><br />Of course, the $60,000 question is:  is this a good thing?  After all, our memories are part of our personality makeup;  they make us who we are.  This is true of both good & bad memories.  Is it not dangerous to try & be selective about what we remember?<br /><br />Such is the outline of the story that this movie addresses.  It ends up being a cross between a Drama and Romantic Comedy (it has some VERY funny scenes).<br /><br />Jim Carrey continues on his quest that he can do more than slapstick comedy, and he does a credible job.  This is a very different role for Kate Winslett.  Normally she portrays characters who are subdued & rational.  In this film, her character is flakey, impulsive and (somehow?) endearing.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a great date movie, this one is worth a look. It is also cathartic for people who have ever entertained the notion that it's better to forget than to remember.

It has everything you want in a party film:  an outlandish plot, funny scenes, Sean William Scott, the classic \\"nerd\\" character, some gorgeous babes, male fantasies and lots of gratuitous nudity.  Of the latter, seeing Amy Smart take her shirt off is worth the price of the DVD all by itself!<br /><br />Party movies are not the types of movies where it is productive to go into plot analysis.  Let's just say that we have to track a group of college guys who have to make a trip cross-country to the university of Texas.  Along the way, just about every zany thing that can go wrong does go wrong, and the result is a movie that is way fun.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|For anyone who is a fan of great blues music then this is a must own cd/dvd. Kenny Wayne Shepherd travels and plays with some true blues legends (BK King et al) and a lot of artists who I had not heard of. Excellent music throughout and a very good history of how some of the styles of blues came in to existence. <br />Unfortunately some of the artists have since passed away since making this album but this only cements the standing of this cd as a must have for any blues novice or officianado alike. <br />Awesome
0061053430|5.0|This book is an indispensable companion for huge fans of the ALIEN series, especially those who, like me, think that ALIENS is the pinnacle of the franchise.  But even if you're just a casual fan of the series but a major lover of science fiction, this is a great book to have. <br /> <br />The most amazing part of the book is the long essay on combat between capital ships in space.  The essay is a very hard-science fiction oriented piece that addresses a lot of the issues with ship to ship combat that are taken for granted in works like Star Trek and Star Wars.  It addresses issues like combat between two ships in orbit around a planet, cloaking against a starfield, space mine arrays, directed energy weapons, railguns, and the use of decoys in space combat. <br /> <br />The rest of the book is equally believable in its portrayal of futuristic warfare, and it does an excellent job of giving background information on the world of ALIEN without holding the reader's hand or revealing everything.  The pictures, drawings, and schematics are nothing short of amazing.

B00000JG41|1.0|I just cant see the whole Mike Patton thing,I mean yeah hes a great vocalist and i CERTAINLY THINK HIS BEST WORK IS BEHIND HIM. Faith No More had a COUPLE of good albums,and im not talking about Epic, but drivel is drivel is drivel. Maybe I have been spoiled by some real cutting edge music,or some of the vastly talented bands that metal has to offer,even on the progressive side. I'm sorry guys,this stuff to me while interesting,is just a complete cacaphony of noise. Perhaps Mike Patton should get together with another vocal icon who has long since run out of gas,Axl Rose,and can do some 50's doo-wop and perhaps some ballroom standards. Now THATS cutting edge.
B00004S3AN|1.0|I know this album very well since I have the original which was released in the early 60s, but I don't want to play it and accelerate it's deterioration. In my current state of techno ignorance, however, I did not realize this format (SACD) was not compatible with my CD player. I will definitely buy the correct format CD of this album since it is a unique and classic example of that era's jazz and an overall wonderful performance by an outstanding artist.

B000H5TH1Q|5.0|Well, maybe 4.5 stars.  The first time I saw this movie I was totally taken in by the clever plot.  Yes, there is a major scene that doesn't quite work, but I commend Brian de Palma for admitting this in the Featurettes. These four featurettes are just as entertaining as the movie, and it's interesting to see the actors 22 years after the filming reviewing their own performances and recalling their experiences.  Anamorphic widescreen with no compression artifacts.  Great soundtrack by Pino Donaggio, especially the music that plays during the dance scenes in the neighbor's house.  A fine DVD edition. Don't read any reviews with plot spoilers until after you've seen the picture.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I was a big fan of 'Fallen' and enjoyed the combo of Amy Lee and Ben Moody. It has come to light in recent times that Ben Moody and Amy Lee shared a relationship that soured and mid-way through the European leg of the 'Nowhere But Home' tour, Ben Moody left the band and cut his ties with Amy Lee. Whatever the case be, there is no argument that together they had a unbeatable duo, Moody on guitar and Lee on vocals. The humble beginnings of Evanescence stemmed from these two people growing together as friends and musically sharing to enrich both of them. But what often is the case is the onset of fame and recognition brings the pitfuls. And in this case that is what happened with Evanescence. I will always argue the only true greatest album of Evanescence was 'Fallen' and to a lesser extent 'Nowhere But Home'.<br /><br />I have many of Evanescence's earlier songs downloaded from sites allowed by Lee. Not one was included on 'The Open Door'. Instead this new album was a belittlement of Moody in 'Call Me When You're Sober'. I am sorry, call me daft, but leave your personal thoughts on a person out of a song. Especially someone you grew up with Amy. Have respect for what you two created. This new album is little more than a selfish diatribe into her own feelings on the break-up. Instead of moving forward, her apparent pain is open for all to see. I cannot believe to this day that 'Call Me When You're Sober', became a radio friendly hit single - it is a awful song and hence this album doesnt get past 4 stars.<br /><br />However there are less than a handful of songs that salvage this album, they are the radio friendly 'Lithium', 'Lacrymosa' and 'Like You' a hark back to the sounds of Fallen.<br /><br />I once saw a future of Evanescence but now I only see one more album release and then Amy Lee will fall back into obscurity. I wish her luck in her future dealings and hope she realises that fame does come at a social, personal price.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|When I first heard that a cinematic version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" was being made, with Keira Knightley as its star, I felt the first quivers of trepidation -- but when I finally was able to view the finished product, my trepidation rapidly escalated to alarm, outrage, bewilderment and ultimately disgust. <br /> <br />I am NOT a self-proclaimed \\"Janeist\\" or \\"purist\\" and am completely willing to believe that a great film version of one of my all-time favorite novels can be made; however, I simply cannot understand why THIS movie was made, other than as a commercial endeavor designed to capitalize on Keira Knightley's previous successful turn in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\"  I shudder to think of (and in fact know several of) the masses of young girls who now think of this abomination as the definitive \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and will never go on to read the real thing, never mind see the truly definitive BBC miniseries version. <br /> <br />Here's my point:  if you are going to significantly change aspects of a classic and beloved story (and, let's not forget, a classic story that has often been called one of the most perfectly constructed pieces of fiction in the history of English literature), do it with respect.  DON'T leave the story in its historically correct timeframe and then \\"dumb it down\\" with modern vernacular, manners (or lack thereof) and sentiments.  DON'T totally discard the mores and social graces of the time period in question (to wit:  families such as the Bennetts did NOT have pigs (!)running in and out of their house, nor was mealtime a free-for-all of reaching and grabbing.  Nor would Lady Catherine deBurgh have EVER, under any circumstances, descended upon the Bennett household in the middle of the night regardless of her outrage.)  If you feel moved to make changes, for heaven's sake, make ACCURATE changes. <br /> <br />I also must strenously object to the way many major characters are portrayed in this version, at variance with the book.  For example, Mr. Bennett, as written by Jane Austen, is clearly unhappy in his marriage and has no respect or affection for a woman whose looks turned his head in his youth but has long since proven herself to be ill-suited in nearly every way to be his life partner.  In this film version, Mr. Bennett (as portrayed by Donald Sutherland, who is entirely capable of a more correct and acerbic interpretation) shows little real agitation or annoyance and, in fact, frequently seems fond of his wife in a somewhat benevolently distracted sort of way.  Likewise, Mrs. Bennett appears in this version to be almost reasonably distracted over the prospect of marrying off five daughters as opposed to Jane Austen's original, who is at turns irritable, giddy, indiscreet and given to dealing with the events of her life with hypochondriac swoons.  Even more notably, Darcy himself is portrayed by Daniel McFadyen not as haughty, aloof, imperious and unable to break out of the strictures of his upbringing and class but as unsure and confused.  Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett is annoyingly shrill and giddy and reminds me of nothing more than the attitude with which the first women suffragettes wore pants (\\"Look at me!! Look at me!! Just look at how OUTSPOKEN I am!!\\"), but she is not the worst culprit here.  (McFadyen, I feel moved to add, is actually quite dishy and would probably make a terrific Heathcliff -- all that silent brooding that he does would be put to much better use -- but nobody does haughty better than Colin Firth.) <br /> <br />Beyond the aforementioned horror of putting the Bennetts' homelife on a level with the Clampetts, I also object to some of the changes in setting (most dealing with Eliza and Darcy's meetings -- in the Grecian temple, in the rain, walking across the fields at dawn) as being mawkishly, screamingly melodramatic and unoriginal. <br /> <br />The whole point of P&P is how two people, bound by the class restraints and social conventions of theirtime, managed to surmount them -- NOT cast them off wholesale.   The plot of this story is inextricably entwined with its setting in a society with very strict codes of behavior, and to impose modern manners is not only jarring but destroys its very premise. <br /> <br />I did give the movie one star on the merit of its cinematography and soundtrack, both of which were excellent.  I would have loved to love this film and was beyond disappointed that my initial reservations were proven well founded.  One wonders:  will an \\"updated\\" retelling of Gone With the Wind be next??
B000H30B2C|4.0|Yes Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is flawed. While I didn't mind the extra time devoted to character development in the beginning, judging from many of the other reviews it's obviously too long for some viewers. Director Peter Jackson may be accused by some as the king of bloat, endlessly padding his movies with superfluous action scenes that don't really move the story along and Kong is no exception. The most obvious example for me is the dinosaur stampede scene. Jack Black and crew run under a herd of brachiosaurs while being simultaneously hunted by velociraptors. Well, a little or a lot of belief suspension is needed depending on your point of view and it is action for action's sake. But this is a fantasy movie, an escapist diversion designed to entertain, which it does quite well. This isn't Citizen Kane and it isn't ment to be. It's not meant to conform to reallity. Let's face it, if Kong were real, every time he moved the weight of his body would snap his arms and spine like twigs. But for the most part the action is outstanding, especially Kong's battle with three tyranosaurs and the scenery and sets are wonderful.<br /><br />But where PJ succeeds is not in the over the top choreographed action sequences, but in the emotional resonance he brings to Kong. He was able to make a CGI monkey not only believable, but a powerful character in his own right. He's not just a monster. Kong is portrayed as an embattled warrior/king whose scared body belies his ultimate loneliness. He is the last of his kind and his human-like pathos is amazing and palpable. Andy Serkis the actor who also played Gollum in the Lord Of The Rings was the model for King Kong and it is his facial expressions that were used as the basis for Kong. He really should win some sort of award for \\"best digital actor\\" or whatever you would call it as it is a new category marvelously pioneered by he, PJ and the effects folks. Kong is ultimately destroyed by his love for Ann Darrow portrayed by Naomi Watts and it is this relationship, his love and her sympathy and empathy for this lonely king that makes this movie so compelling. Kong is a tragic and sympathetic figure. The  moment he dies you can see the light go out of his eyes, a remarkable bit of CGI wizardry and it is truly sad. As Jack Black says at the end of the movie with dialog lifted verbatim from the original, \\"twas beauty killed the beast.\\"<br /><br />As far as the DVD is concerned Peter Jackson and company have once again outdone themselves in the extra features department. There's enough to keep you occupied for some time. Well done.mi Watts and it is this relationship, his love and her sympathy and empathy for this lonely king that makes this movie so compelling.

Everyone knows about the high quality of Gin and Juice and Who Am I?, but songs like Tha Shiznit, Gz and Hustlas and Pump Pump are where the album truly shines. It is extremely easy to listen to the whole album all the way through and want to listen to it again and again. A home run for hip hop and music!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Some listeners will recognize every single phrase and drum lick in spite of the fact that George Martin and son have masterfully reworked the Beatles' catalog into a new tapestry of sound. There were two or three moments the origin of which I was not entirely certain, but my ancient ears were delightfully refreshed by the new juxtaposition of \\"old favorites\\" from the music of my youth. Knowing that this recording was created with visuals in mind, it's easy to imagine it as a soundtrack for a Cirque de Soleil performance, but it also stands alone as a sonic experience. Listeners new to the Beatles music (Are there any?) should be grateful for such a rich introduction. For them this is like a Greatest Hits compilation of historic moments in Beatle history. For those of us who memorized every song for a decade, this is more than a meandering down memory lane - it is a chance to have a new experience with old friends.

0670034711|3.0|Just finished this book: \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\".  I had a hard time putting the book down.  It was most enjoyable to read of her adventures throughout the three countries she visited.  Her travel back from her severe depression due to her failed marriage was painful to read. The severe depression had a vice-like grip on her emotions and continues throughtout the book almost like another character in the book.  The other characters she meets throughout her travels are interesting and enjoyable.  It is not a piece of literary genius.
B0002234LS|1.0|This is an awesome awesome movie.  I say that because it is one of the best renditions Hollywood has ever done of a person suffering from \\"psychotic depression.\\"  Johnny Depp (who is effected by it) lets the viewer watch this illness evolve in a slow journey down into the dark pit of insanity.  The audience experiences this pure psychosis in a fashion that is authentic to the T. <br /> <br />The movie ingeniously shows this form of stress-induced-insanity which is so brilliantly triggered by (1) finding your wife in bed with her boyfriend, (2) the impending divorce, (3) Depp having to move out of his house and into a summer house on a lake, and (4) the inevitable financial stress on this lead character.  I mean, oh my god, he must be running about 500 stress points!  That's enough to trigger a psychotic attack on anyone who is predisposed to psychotic mental illness (paranoid schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar, psychotic depression, post-partum psychosis - about 8 million US people). <br /> <br />This is exactly the type of stress that triggered me to go into an almost identical type of psychotic episode a number of years ago while an army officer assigned to Germany.  For me, the stressors were very similar to the movie - move to Europe, new platoon leader, financial difficulties, relationship stress, new language to speak, etc.   <br /> <br />Psychosis means delusions and the movie very realistically showed the onset of the \\"persecutorial delusion\\" (where you think someone is coming to get you) by showing Turturro coming to get Johnny.  And then the formation of the potentially more serious \\"grandiose delusion\\" where you think that others (real people) are conspiring against you.  This is where some psychotic people will actually lash out at others, and by so doing, if they harm them, they become criminally insane.  Of the 8 million of us who have this type of psychotic illness, about 50,000 of us will do this.  We'll read about the next one in the newspapers next week.  Almost all of these will be done by people who did not know they had a psychotic illness, were not previously diagnosed and were not medicated.  And this is exactly Depp's situation in the film (I have psychotic bipolar and must take lithium for mania, and Zyprexa for psychosis daily). <br /> <br />Psychosis also means hallucinations.  And Turturro has this part by playing an \\"imaginary paranoid hallucination antagonist.\\"  This is really an ingenious Hollywood technique because it helps others in our society understand psychosis by showing a visual hallucination.  I believe the technique was first used in \\"Beautiful Mind.\\"  This phenomenon, coupled with the delusions, is what makes paranoid psychosis a horrifying experience. <br /> <br />The movie shows this paranoid delusional psychosis very well and Depp actually lashes out at a number of people in his psychotic episode.  For me, I got these same types of delusions and similar hallucinations in Germany but never lashed out at others - therefore I got an honorable discharge as a captain, after getting out of the stressful situation and the psychosis dissipated. <br /> <br />I liked the above parts of the movie very well for its authenticity - it was good.  However what I didn't like about the movie is that it went way over board in the number of homicides.  This just adds to the mental illness stereotype and the stigma.  And so more people won't go in and get help when they should be getting help and medication.  It took me 23 years before I got help.  Why?  Because of the stigma and fear.  Maybe if society didn't have this stigma, we wouldn't have these types of terrible tragedies like in this movie.  My heart goes out to anyone who has been impacted by this.   <br /> <br />Society has available the medicine and counseling which is needed to eliminate this type of tragedy.  Maybe if they educated the masses in a smart way we could eliminate it.  But instead we \\"monsterize\\" this illness by this type of movie.

There is intense violence, so please wait until they are older. Whether or not you believe in the teaching of any church or religion, this movie will leave you touched, humbled and amazed that Christ existied.      The fact that a single man believed in God so much that he endured the floggings, beatings and painful death inspires me to be a better person.    I hope it inspires you, too.

1400082773|5.0|This book was a great read. I was fascinated by the life Barack Obama has lived in his young life.  I was equally impressed by his intelligent style of writing.<br /><br />This book profiles Barack's youth up to his application to Harvard law.  He outlines his search for his identity since his father was a black African native and his mother a white woman from Kansas.  Being raised primarily by his mother and her parents, he also lived for a time in Indonesia with his mother and then Indonesian stepfather.  All of this makes for interesting reading.<br /><br />More interesting is Barack's journeys abroad later in his life and I won't relay where he journeyed so as to not spoil your read.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Obama as an honest American, a Senator and a 2008 Presidential candidate.
B00005JPAM|5.0|In the first week of September 1997, between the death of Princess Diana and her funeral, Queen Elizabeth (Mirren) was in a situation that she had no preparation for.  She did not feel anything should be done for the princess by the monarchy, as she has divorced from Prince Charles (Jennings), but the people of England were looking to her to show some compassion.  Newly elected Prim Minister Tony Blair (Sheen) attempts to offer advice to the Queen, but he mostly rebuffed.  Adding to the tension is the fact that Blair's popularity skyrockets in this time of national mourning.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is a fascinating look into the world of the British Monarchy.  I know very little about it, and the film held my interest throughout.  Mirren is excellent as a queen who is struggling to maintain the only lifestyle she has ever known in the face of changing times and a popular ex-monarch's death.  Sheen is also good as Tony Blair.  All in all, \\"The Queen\\" is an extremely engaging film that is worth seeing.

0743455967|5.0|I love this book. Not only is it a great memoir of the king of scary but it's really a great read. I don't know how non-writers think of this book but I think it's great. I love reading it over and over again. He's witty and insightful, and speaks to someone who writes from the same vein. <br /> <br />If you've wanted to 'dabble' in fiction, you will get serverly reprimanded by King. He doesn't like dabblers. He wants those that want to be seriously dedicated to the written word. But all are welcome to the table. Hacks or not. And that's what makes him great. There's no air of pretention, he's out there and front and center. If you can dedicate yourself to sitting down in front of the keyboard every day and bang out a few pages, then you are welcome at the table. It's an encouraging little book.  <br /> <br />He doesn't go into great detail over grammar and composition, assuming that everyone's taken at least some level of high school english. He does go over the rudimentary and sometimes actually goes over some of the things that irk him, but who doesn't have their writing pet peeves?

If anything, I tend to appreciate Martin's writing even more as the story progresses.<br /><br />After reading Book II, I took a short break and read several other works before returning for Book III.  I found myself becoming impatient to return to A Song of Ice and Fire.  The subject matter intrigues me and Martin's style is right up my alley.  Though there is never an \\"ultimate resolution\\", each chapter results in a kind of cliffhanger that leaves you looking forward to a return of the just completed thread.  I can honestly say that none of the threads fails to entertain, some on radically different levels.<br /><br />Martin can write as many installments as he wishes and I'll read them all.

His appeal in this movie adds alot, as does the other stars fine performances. Martin Scorcese's cinematography and the rapid pace of the storytelling don't leave any moments for attention lapses. The information comes at you pretty non-stop and if your not paying attention, you might miss a crucial element to the complex story. Involved as it is, it still was very well conceived I felt. What a complicated balancing act Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters juggled! Every twist and turn to the story made the entire thing all the more compelling to watch. Everyone will decide for themselves how this Scorcese flick stacks up to his others, but comparisons notwithstanding, it was a highly entertaining and well done drama.

The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is because I didn't really care for the theme of the editing with changing back and forth from black and white to color and the effects of old film.

Sylvia Plath's THE BELL JAR has always held a fascination for me, given my existential love of Dostoyevsky and others, but it is one I have only read bits and pieces of, from time-to-time.<br /><br />This audio book, read by Maggie Gyllenhall, literally \\"blew me away\\" with its over developed sentences woven by Ms. Plath, woven in such a manner as sugar crystals cross and re-cross each other as they form cotton candy at the county fair each fall in the small Southern neck of the woods where I was raised.  I had heard of Ms. Gyllenhall, and knew of her movies, but I was not prepared to listen to such an exceptional audio interpretation, read in a manner that captured the essence of Ms. Plath's downward spiral into insanity.<br /><br />The words are sheer poetry, with metaphors written upon metaphors, in such a manner that enhances, rather than confuse, the spirit of the book and, and an almost innate understanding of what she is going through.  While one wishes, hopes, prays, that she'll get better,  the reader remembers, with sadness, how this allegorical account of Ms. Plath has no happy ending....<br /><br />If you haven't read THE BELL JAR, or even if you have, and you have seven plus hours to immerse yourself in a great undertaking, do buy this audio book and reflect upon a pleasure one gets from hearing a true wordsmith write of the confusion she along must deal with called \\"life.\\"
0743454537|5.0|I have read two other of Jodi's books and this one was the hardest to finish. I was shocked at the turn of events, moved to tears at the plight this family endured. But it was also a story of compassion versus common sense and also how an illness can take not just one persons life, but also the entire family's .
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Great edition.. been wanting since it came out and finally got it.  Rewatching the entire show again.. its so much better unedited unlike when its aired on regular tv.  You miss too much of the show.. so if you have been seeing it on tv now that its syndicated.. do yourself a big favor..stop watching it on tv and buy the series on dvd.. !
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Sure, it's up for arguement here, but I am pretty sure that no one hated My Chemical Romance more than I did. There compleltly over the top, borderline cauterwauling music was not my cup of tea. To say the least. In fact I was pretty sure that their success was the forth and final horse of the apocalypse. <br />Well tickle me surprised and wrong here as \\"The Black Parade\\", the Jersey quintet's third proper full length, is one of the strongest, catchiest, well put together LP's in recent rock music. <br />Fans of classic rock will immediatly hear simiularties between this album and a litany of many other album orientated bands, from the lead off track \\"The End\\", which is simuliar to Pink Floyd's \\"In the Flesh\\", to the glam-tastic (and fantastic) \\"Teenagers\\", to the suite style of the Who found on \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\". There's some Alice Cooper sprinkled around throughout, some of David Bowie's over-the-topness, even a few power ballads for the kids who still carry lighters to shows. <br />But the funny thing is that even though this disc is firmly placed in the classic rock traditions the record is never a blatent rip off. MCR take these influences and blend them into their tried and true formula and come up with something melodic and ambitious but never arrogant or pretentious. <br />The playing is all top notch, the lyrics, though occasionally a little too dependent on A-B rhyming structure, carry the somewhat vague storyline of the album throughout with a sense of humor that counteracts all the sadness of the album, turning this into a truly three dimensional album and the proudction is perfectly large, from the crashing guitars and drums to the multi tracking on top of multi-tracked vocals. Rob Cavallo, who also produced the excellent Green Day record \\"American Idiot\\", earned his paycheck as producer of this one, believe you me. <br />So yeah, I'm still not sure that this is a great band (I recently tipped into their back catalog and still am not fond ofwhat I heard) but this IS a great rock record, one that nods to the past without ripping it off. Any serious rock fan should give this record a listen because they will be pleasantly surprised with what they hear. <br />Hell, any music fan should hear this sucker. Because there was no better record that I heard last year.
B000002KDS|5.0|WAY BACK IN 1972 WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD I WENT INTO MY LOCAL KMART AND SAW A RED ALBUM WITH A HUGE SNAKE ON THE FRONT. NEEDLESS TO SAY I PURCHASED IT.THE BACK COVER WAS JUST AS GRUESOME WITH FIVE UGLY HIPPIES ON IT. WHEN I OPENED MY PRIZE I SAW ALICE HANGING HIMSELF WITH A BONUS 1972 CALENDER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIC.LITTLE DID I KNOW THE MUSIC WOULD BE MORE \\"KILLER\\" THAN THE ALBUM COVER. I TURNED MY STROBE LIGHT AND BLACKLIGHT ON AND LOOKED AT MY BLACKLIGHT POSTER OF A GHOUL FLOATING OVER A GRAVEYARD AND STARTED THE LP. THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK I WAS HOOKED FROM THE FIRST STRAINS OF UNDER MY WHEELS.THE WHOLE ALBUM KICKS FROM START TO FINISH AND IM SURE 95 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE READING THIS HAVE HEARD THE SONGS A MILLION TIMES.WHAT I ALWAYS LIKED ABOUT ALICES EARLY ALBUMS WAS THAT THEY CAME WITH PRIZES. KILLER HAD A CALENDAR,SCHOOLS OUT HAD THE RECORD ALBUM WRAPPED IN PAPER PANTIES LOL BILLION DOLLAR BABIES HAD PUNCH OUT TRADING CARDS AND A HUGE BILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE AND MUSCLE OF LOVE HAD A SMALL POSTER OF EM ALL PEELING POTATOES AFTER BEING BEAT UP BY A GORILLA! EVERY KID SHOULD HAVE KILLERS IN THEYRE COLLECTION LIKE I DID.I AM PLEASED THAT I FOUND THIS ALBUM ON MY OWN WITHOUT ANYONE TURNING ME ON TO IT.FIVE STARS FOR SURE.THANKS FOR READING.MARK \\"STOMP\\" CHOMA
B00005JL2O|5.0|Everything worked out great.  No problems what so ever, thats why I love purchasing through amazon
0765348276|5.0|While the steady stream of interesting and entertaining ideas in this book is reminiscent of Heinlein, the quality of the writing surpasses all but the very best of Heinlein's novels. On the strength of this book alone, I'm adding Scalzi to my list of must-buy authors. The setting, the plot and the character development are all first-class. Highly recommended.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Celtic Woman is back in a refreshing new album, rivaling, if not surpassing, their previous work. Once again, recurring themes of nature, destiny, history, heritage and love are infused with Celtic melodies to make this music timeless and classic. And don't discount the fantastic arrangement by David Downes. His genius is clearly exhibited in the orchestral and choral background for the songs, as well as song selection. <br /> <br />Describing this music is a hopeless task; if the words were sufficient, we wouldn't need the music. But I'll try. <br /> <br />1. The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun: <br />Begins with the lush, evocative strains of mystery and exotic nostalgia as only Celtic styles can weave. The music is enriched as the five vocals (Chloë, Órla, Lisa, Méav and newcomer Hayley) join their voices into a spectacular blossoming melody of morning and dawn, of newness and awakening.  <br /> <br />In a musical interlude, the wondrous violinist Máiréad takes charge with her rapturous performance. To listen to her is not enough. To fully understand her talent (indeed, the talent of the entire group) you have to buy the DVD or catch a viewing on PBS. Máiréad is a fleet-footed fairy similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's character Tinuviel. She dances and darts about the stage, bounding from one end to the other, flinging her flaxen hair to and fro, kicking up her heels. All the while she is playing, her hands moving almost faster than the human eye can follow, sawing the bow across the strings, eliciting fast-paced melodies beyond the scope of human imagination. There is almost a devilish glint of innocent mischief in her eyes and smile as she dances. <br /> <br />In short, the first song is the perfect opening track to reintroduce us to the Celtic Woman reverie. <br /> <br />2. The Prayer <br />A song that fits its name; a simple prayer for guidance and aid. Chloë's voice has clearly matured since the previous album. <br /> <br />3. Newgrange <br />As with \\"Harry's Game\\" from the previous album, the mystical, foreboding songs are entrusted to Órla's voice, the deepest of the group. In this case, the song is of a secret place filled with the memory of heroic kings and druids. <br /> <br />4. Over The Rainbow <br />The classic song is given a unique \\"a cappella\\" interpretation by all of the vocals sans Lisa. I've never been particularly fond of the piece, but the group does an excellent, almost lullaby-like rendition of the song, worth repeating. <br /> <br />5. Granuaile's Dance <br />A solo performance by Máiréad that is half traditional Irish music, half lively dancing music. <br /> <br />6. The Blessing <br />Solo by Lisa, a soft, simple song of love and devotion, blessings imparted to one's significant other. <br /> <br />7. Dúlaman <br />A song dominated by percussion and something we haven't heard much of before, male-dominant background vocals and even a brief male solo. Otherwise, the song is a solo by Méav in Gaelic. The translation has something to do with Irish seaweed and courtship. Don't expect to make much sense of it; just sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br />8. Beyond The Sea <br />A far more ethereal rendition of the song frequently appearing in movies such as Finding Nemo or Apollo 13. Possibly the best version I've yet heard, speaking to future love and rest from one's weary travels. <br /> <br />9. The Last Rose of Summer <br />Hayley's first solo, this is Thomas Moore's poem set to music. The arrangement is more operatic and classical than Celtic. <br /> <br />10. Caledonia <br />One of the top three on the CD. It is another solo from Lisa, and there is just something about this song you just can't put your finger on. It is filled with warmth, love and romance, and the higher calling of \\"Caledonia\\" (the romanticized name for Scotland). <br /> <br />11. Laschia Ch'io Pianga <br />Another operatic solo from Hayley, the song is somewhat repetitive and the melody is monotonous. (Blame Handel.) Probably one of the more uninteresting tracks. It does not even correspond to the sadness that the translated lyrics suggest. It's still good, just not phenomenal. <br /> <br />12. Carrickfergus <br />A quiet ballad from Órla (accompanying herself on the harp), a nostalgic song of bygone days in the Irish town of Carrickfergus. <br /> <br />13. Vivaldi's Rain <br />Another very classical piece sung by Chloë. The song is translated as a prayer to the Lord for guidance, but this time because the singer has fallen in love. <br /> <br />14. The Voice <br />One of the most hauntingly beautiful, fast-paced tracks of the CD, \\"The Voice\\" speaks to the past of Ireland. Transcending time, \\"the voice\\" is of nature, of history, of both past, present and future, with all the sadness and glories of both. Hence, the song is both promising and melancholy. With the mournful violin and the harsh percussion mixed with Lisa's crystal clear voice, there's no denying this is one of the top songs of the album. <br /> <br />15. Scarborough Fair <br />A decidedly unhappy song, it is the third solo exceptionally performed by Hayley. She has clearly earned her place in the group. The song is abbreviated from the original, which is a woebegone tale of sundered lovers. <br /> <br />16. Mo Ghile Mear <br />\\"Now the time has come to leave / Keep the flame and still believe / Know that love will shine through darkness / One bright star to light the wave.\\"  <br /> <br />An excellent closing song performed by the entire group, consisting of both English and Gaelic lyrics, a song of happy farewell much resembling \\"The Soft Goodbye\\" from the previous album. <br /> <br />In closing, let me just say, there's a reason this group has spent more than a year on the top of the world record charts. Their music transcends individual styles. The arrangements are appealing. In the performers, talent is manifested in celestial voices and radiant countenance. You're out of excuses. Buy the album. Or the deluxe. Still further, buy the DVD.
1400079179|4.0|For those of us who read for fun, and could really care less whether a book is completely accurate, especially when it says \\"Fiction\\" on it, I would reccommend this book. It was fast-paced, and it's a great topic to talk to your friends about, as long as you are looking for a discussion.<br /><br />There are so many different viewpoints on this book, but I have only one viewpoint. It was well written, interesting, and it was twisted: in a good way.<br /><br />I would reccommend this book to those of us who read for enjoyment, and aren't about to go criticizing every single error. FICTION people. FICTION.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I saw \\"Walk the Line\\" and fell in love with Johnny Cash, this is a great CD. Absolutely fabulous.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Even though I liked this documentary, and it did leave me thinking about how can we all as single human beings help the earth last longer with a little effort and consciousness, I must say that because of all the hype I heard prior to wathcing it, my expectations were higher for this film. But I do reccomend it :)
B000LC4CVA|4.0|I find this DVD to be soothing & uplifting. The only problem is that there was no title to the selections on the DVD itself & no lyrics printed on the cover.
B00004HYLF|5.0|Not only is this 1976 release one of the defining studio albums in fusion, the album art was produced during the heady times of the music industry when the visual appeal through beautiful paintings also took center stage.<br /><br />Chick Corea (k) shows the influences from Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman, without the overbearing pretentiousness that plagued the dynamic duo during the height of their careers. Al DiMeola (g) is only 21 years old at the time of the session and the rhythm section can't get much better with Stanley Clarke (b) & Lenny White (d).<br /><br />Corea leads the group with some of his best work on Medieval Overture, with DiMeola showing amazing technical prowess during Sorceress. The title track sets the foundation for the best cut, the Yes-inspired Majestic Dance. The band performs some quiky tricks in The Magician and The Duel of the Jester and the Tyrant (Part I and Part II) - a great example of an arty 1970s song title - allows Clarke & White to get down with a funky sound.<br /><br />Corea learned his musical lessons well as a member of several groups that Miles Davis used to define the new frontier of fusion. And that Return to Forever took the musical experience to another level makes Romantic Warrior a classic.
B000BP86OG|4.0|I was skeptical about this CD at first as I had listened to The Darkness' first album, Permission to Land, and didn't care for it at all. With this album, however, The Darkness has grown on me and I highly recommend it -- especially to fans of Queen. At times I get the feeling they're actually channeling Queen through their harmonies, Dan Hawkins' guitar, and Justin Hawkins' falsetto. You'll either love the falsetto or hate it, but you'll have to admit the guy's got talent! My favorite track is 'Hazel Eyes,' which has a sort of Celtic-gone-wild feel to it.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Being a huge fan of this director, it's no surprise I recommend the film ... but only if you can tolerate extremely challenging cinema.  If you like films that make you feel happy about being alive, this isn't for you.  If you like films that don't make you think, this isn't for you.<br /><br />Much has been and will be written of the film's violence and rape scene.  Less will be written about the ways the director makes you feel uncomfortable (sound, camera work and lighting effects).  Trust me, it all works, and if you have a good sound system or are prone to seizures you may just want to stay away from this one.  Noe likes dealing with mass manipulation through things like film, and this movie is no exception.  Its violence and rape scene don't make this an effective film, however.  It's what leads up to it (in reverse order, of course.)<br /><br />Naysayers will easily dismiss this film as vile, and they are right.  But it is also honest and unafraid.  To dismiss it without seeing it, however, shows how little some people know.  You can't help but be moved by what Noe is doing, and he isn't trying to move you in a positive way.  He's making a statement, and it's a statement that says revenge is hideous and sometimes necessary; that men are beasts (and that's sometimes a saving grace); and that people don't make the most of the time they are given.<br /><br />Vile?  Maybe so.  But so is ignorance.
B000M341QO|1.0|I am not easily annoyed or shocked but found this movie absolutely annoying in its inaccuracy (the Massachusetts State Police must be livid as they were never integrity-compromised in the \\"real\\" story on which this was based)and boring use of the English language.  In fact, there was little use of language which was not streams of continually obscenity (not bothersome in appropriate doses from appropriate characters) but everyone in this movie seems to have synthetic Turret's Syndrome.  There is hardly a sentence without a scorching stream of cursing until one wishes to turn off the sound.<br /><br />This makes it difficult to drum up any interest in the plot. The script writer seems to have confused the mafia with a Manhattan hip hop street gang.<br /><br />AWFUL MOVIE.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Leo DeCaprio is awesome in this, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like him at all!  If this doesn't win best picture and best director at the Oscars then something is wrong with the voters.  This movie is worth both your time and your money to buy it.  I have not met anyone yet who didn't thoroughly enjoy this movie.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|It's too bad that people don't try to separate politics and science the way they zealously try to keep politics and religion separate.  If anything needs to be free of politics it's science.  There are plenty of scientists that disagree with the conclusions Al Gore has made and they are being viciously attacked and losing their jobs. <br /> <br />Both the Earth and Mars are currently experiencing warming.  You don't have to be a scientist to figure out that there are no humans on Mars so the warming must be natural.  The earth's climate has ALWAYS been changing and goes through warming and cooling periods naturally. Most of the warming during this cycle started way before 1940 before the industrial revolution.  In fact from about 1940-1980 the hype was about Global COOLING and the fear was that we were headed for another ice age!  Google \\"junk science ice age\\" to see a Time magazine cover story from 1974 about the \\"coming Ice Age\\".
B0000E64TQ|5.0|This is a celebration for music fans. The best CD by Elton John, even better. One of the best albums of all times and among my Top 20 favorite albums of all time. The album hit #1 in the Billboard Pop List in 1973. This is the Deluxe edition on SACD Surround Sound. The remaster of the audio is outstanding and will blow you away! This edition comes with a DVD (The Making of GYBR) that lasts about 50 minutes. This is the film that was previously published on DVD in the collection Classic Albums. If you already have this DVD, you can buy the CD SACD separately for $29,00. If you don't, I strongly recommend you to get the \\"whole package.\\" The film tells the inside story of the making of this classic album with archive footage and interviews from Elton John, Bernie Taupin, Davey Johnstone, Nigel Olsson, Gus Dudgeon (producer of the original album), etc. The documentary has many terrific moments. To me, the best one is when Elton John is singing Candle in the Wind in honor of the Princess Diana. GYBR was released as a double album. CD1 contains the first 8 songs of LP1. CD2 contains the other 9, plus 4 bonus tracks, one of them Candle in the Wind acoustic, previously unreleased. The packaging is gorgeous with a booklet that contains a presentation by John Tobler, the original art work with lyrics, and some drafts of some lyrics. I had the original album on CD already, but went ahead and bought this edition and I am completely and absolutely satisfied. No regrets! The only problem is that this is expensive. But honestly, I am a collector and I appreciate the record company for releasing this so beautifully. If we don't buy this gems, record companies will stop doing this and then we'll go back to the complaints that the music industry sucks today. This is how CD's should be. Great music, great lyrics, great art work, packaging and sound! This is a MUST for any collector. 5 Stars, 10 over 10!<br /><br />P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to. I modestly write them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing them.u wish to.

B000LC55F2|4.0|For me, this was one of the most involving movies of 2006. Like a magic trick, I was totally mesmerized. I like movies that don't follow trends and aren't predictable. I like movies that make you think. Nevertheless, I was initially frustrated at the end of this film, because I hadn't figured it out when the credits rolled. I finally got it while in the theater parking lot. After realizing this, I gained a great appreciation of the writing and the direction. This is not an easy story to tell. The story itself is a trick. there are clues throughout the film, but you don't realize it until its over. This is a movie you see with friends and can talk about for hours later.  It's a perfect DVD purchase because you want to see it over and over to catch all the clues and tricks.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|For me the Timothy Dalton version could not have been bested, but I was wrong. The Dalton version,so faithful to the original novel is still excellent, though on re-viewing seems locked indoors and low-budget.      The Dalton version gave the story about 6 hours, with a substantial amount of time spent on Jane's childhood at the horrible boarding school.  Again, this was straight from the novel, but, let's face it, for those of us who know the story, we're waiting for her to grow up and meet Mr. Rochester.    Now, on to the current version.  The story remains a great mixture of seething passion, frustrated hopes on both sides, and the struggle within one heroine between steely, virtuous, self-reliance, and a simple desire to be loved. Toby Stevens is younger than the hero is often portrayed, but still looks as if he's seen the world and fought against the unhappiness and cynicism that years of dissipated living can bring.  He is handsome, but not pretty.  Ruth Wilson's Jane is written as chaste but not priggish,  lonely but eager to love, and, most especially, strong and independent, but in no way inappropriately feminist for the 19th century of the setting. If anything she's a bit more physically passionate than we've seen before, but it does make her seem more real.    The budget is high and it shows--lots of gorgeous outdoor scenes, beautiful period interiors , sumptuous gowns. Here and there there are some breaches of Victorian etiquette that don't ring quite true, and there are of course some deletions and skimping on some of the story lines,particularly with the Rivers family.  However, I think once the decision was made to have this fit into 4 hours, the plot choices they made were mostly good ones.  There is great chemistry between the two principals and most importantly, they seem entirely believable and at home in the period of the story.  Spoiler warning:  the final scene struck me as little too Hollywoody and 'sunny' for what is essentially  a Gothic-style dark novel (madwoman in the attic and all) but at least it is nicely romantic.
0521397812|2.0|I only found one idea that I'd consider using in this book.  It's thin for $25.00 and the activities are largely variants on very simple ideas I've already seen in fifty other places.  I don't think you need this book unless you really have no ideas at all, in which case it's as good as any other book.
B000000YNZ|5.0|perfect for the home late at night, or for night driving in the car, this is a quiet bill evans trio album. chuck israels bass playing compliments mr evans piano superbly and paul motian's drums are subtle and tasteful. a disc that all bill evans fans should have, or any fan of jazz piano trio music should have. mr evans is one of the most lyrically brilliant pianists in jazz history & is in fine, fine form on this recording from 1962.
B000F48CD8|3.0|Really great stuff, but a 30-minutes cd is inexcusable. 5-star music, but minus 2 for quantity.
B000J103OI|3.0|\\"Mildly amusing\\" was how another reviewer put it, and I agree entirely, purely because of Meryl Streep. Streep is wonderful as this outrageous caricature of an egocentric (if not egomaniacal) fashion magagine head, who never speaks above a whisper, but whose every whisper is like the thunder of the Almighty to her mesmerised/terrified underlings. The entire world revolves around this woman and don't you dare even think otherwise. Only once does the character show some vulnerability, but that soon passes and she's firmly back in the saddle. Streep's harrassed 2-I-C is also excellent, everyone else is filler. Anne Hathaway looks gorgeous in a variety of outfits, but little else.
0307341542|5.0|Man, oh man!  I guess a lot of us feel we grew up with a messed up family but this book made me appreciate my growing up years and what could have been much worse.<br /><br />A very disturbing book, one I will think about in years to come - not always with pleasure.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|... I'd find a way to let Donner make Superman II the way he intended. Some people get what this movie is while other's don't. This is not a film by Richard Donner... this is simply his cut done with the footage he had available to him. He didn't get to finish filming all the scenes he wanted to so this isn't completely his movie. It's just the closest he could get to it. <br /> <br />I prefer this version's to Lester's version for one simple reason. It stays truer to the characters. It's not perfect, but it's less flawed. My only gripe about it... [**** SPOILER!!!! Superman turns back time again.*****] But that's only one flaw. Lester, on the other hand, took too many creative liberties with the material. In Lester's version the Kryptonian convicts had different powers from Superman, like shooting beams from their palms. Then again Superman had ridiculous powers like the kiss that makes you forget and throwing a plastic 'S' shield. I'll take Donner's vision of Superman II over plastic 'S' shields any day. <br /> <br />Donner's version just had more heart to it. It's still the same movie, but the tone is just completely different. I also much prefer Brando's Jor-El over Lara. Superman's mother coddles him... like mother's tend to do, but his father treats him like the man of steel that he is. Brando's presence just makes it feel like a bigger movie. <br /> <br />In the end this movie is what should have been... despite its flaws, it still better than the original. At least in my opinion.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because of the acting and rushed story line, but the message is substantial.  Ancient scrolls are discovered in Peru that offer spiritual enlightenment.  The main character is an American history teacher that, after loosing his job, travels to Peru to investigate the rumored scrolls and he becomes spiritually awakened along the way.  I think the message of auras, intuition, and empowering others is worth viewing.
B0009IW88A|4.0|We all remember Danny Elfman's exciting, legendary score to the original Batman film, as well as the not as good, but still holds its own, sequel score 3 years later. We also remember Elliot Goldenthal's 2 excellent scores to the later Batman films in the late 20th century. Now, we are in a new century, yet going to the beginning of Batman and how he transformed into the dark knight. <br />     With that said, the somewhat surprising composers for the film, as well as the upcoming sequel, are Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, 2 somewhat unique choices in that their writing styles are both so different. Whereas, Zimmer's role in the film is primarily in the action domain, Howard's role is primarily in the more lush, thematic domain. Since I am familiar with both composers' works, it is fairly easy to discern both composers throughout the score. Interestingly, all of the cues in the score are named after Latin species of bats, which won't mean much to you unless you are a die-hard fan of real bats. <br />     Musically speaking, there are no rousing superhero themes as in the Elfman and Goldenthal scores. Rather, the intent here is to provide a more atmospheric approach to the film as Batman slowly transforms into his role. With that said, it then makes sense why the legendary Batman theme is absent, as Batman is not fully the dark knight we are accustomed to in this film as of yet. The first and last tracks begin and end, respectively, with electronic heartbeat effects, resembling the sound of a bat soaring through the air. Zimmer takes the lead in cues such as \\"Myotis\\", the second half of \\"Barbastella\\", \\"Antrozous\\", and \\"Molossus\\", with his usual fast paced brass and electronic percussion, reminiscent of his previous scores, namely The Rock and The Peacemaker. Howard takes the lead in cues such as \\"Eptisicus\\", \\"Macrotus\\", \\"Colynorhinus\\", the first half of \\"Barbastella\\", and \\"Tadarida\\". His work is very lush and beautiful, something we can expect from his previous works, but not something you would expect in a Batman film.  <br />     All in all, a very pleasant surprise with both composers contributions to the score. I certainly look forward to these two guys working together again in the future as they are both very gifted and talented composers. Their work together here proves that they can collaborate great together as well as individually.
0345455681|5.0|After reading London, Sarum, and The Forrest, I became a Rutherfurd fan.  He is a very skilled writer who writes interesting, well-developed characters and plot lines that weave into a satisfying, cohesive whole.  Despite his tendency to run some scenic descriptions a bit long, these three books were a joy to read.  Unfortunately, his other books that take place outside of England, don't seem to offer the same quality.

B0000542D2|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in Garden Grove Calif.. when it came out in 1964. Girls were screming wildly like the beatles were actually there! i wasn,t able to hear a damn thing they said because of all the screaming. me and my brother saw it again afew monthes later in this little theatre and i could finally hear what they were saying! this movie is great! filmed in black and white it has kinda a documentury feel to it. a day in the life of the beatles! it's hard to imagine now, but beatlemania really did happen! i was there! all the songs in this movie are classic beatles songs. they all look great and young!John is really funny in this movie, the bit with ringo and the kid who is skipping school is really good stuff! director richard lester does a great job of letting us fans see the madness that followed them wherever they went. they seemed to take it all in stride. a real fast paced movie, it willleave you wanting more! FIVE STAR. Highly recommended!!

0307346609|3.0|This is a good book, but not a great book. <br /> <br />Let's start off with what succeeds in this book.  The narrative is made up of first-person descriptions of the responses of different nations and individuals to the emergence of George Romero-type living dead as a real menace to humanity.  As fans of Romero's work know, his Living Dead movies are actually social commentaries.  The Living Dead always destroy us in his movies because in the end humanity is too corrupt, venal, deluded and greedy to mount an effective defense.  We always betray ourselves. <br />Brooks is very creative in imagining the personal, military, and technological responses that might arise if the world was confronted with such a crisis, in places as diverse as space stations and high rise apartment blocks.  He's clearly given thought to how various institutions would respond (or not), and what the likely outcomes would be, and for the most part these imaginings feel accurate. <br /> <br />However, that's not enough.  Speculative fiction like this succeeds when the author takes the real world and imagines a complex alternative future, extending current reality forward in ways that are so realistic and plausible that we literally can't imagine things happening any differently.  It fails when the author's own personal biases interfere, so that the events meant to seem realistic seem obviously exaggerated or implausible.  That is the case in this book. <br /> <br />            After a great start where the dead start to rise in an obscure village in China, we are suddenly presented with an idealistic portrayal of the state of Israel, which has not only figured everything out way ahead of everyone else and imposed a self-quarantine, but also - get this! - WELCOMES Palestinian Arabs into its secure zone.  This obviously contrived plot point \\"broke the spell\\" for me, as it will for anyone familiar with the decrepit state of Israeli political leadership and the anti-Arab racism common there today.From that chapter on, I found myself always reading the book at two levels: for the actual story and for the author's own bias, of which there is plenty.  Take his speculation that the crisis forces a nuclear exchange between Pakistan and...Iran?!?  India is the obvious and more likely choice.  This was easily the weakest chapter in the whole book and it was hard not to see Brooks editorializing his own opinions of the Iranians in it - and his opinions are not pretty.  There is more like this, but these are early examples and they diminish what comes after, to the book's detriment. <br /> <br />          A final and more general criticism is that the book is meant to be an \\"oral history,\\" meaning that we are hearing stories in the voices of actual people from around the world.  However, with only a few exceptions, all the voices are alike.  Everyone speaks in clear, compound sentences using college level vocabularies, in nice orderly paragraphs, etc.  Flip open the book to different sections and start reading anywhere and the voices are almost indistinguishable.  If you have read the oral histories of Hiroshima survivors, or some of the new ones coming out of the Indonesian tsunami, you know that this is not how oral histories really read.  This book is available as an audio book and if they use different voices for each person, I bet that would hide this flaw but in print it is pretty obvious. <br /> <br />            I don't want to sound too negative.  Brooks writes well, and I found myself engaged enough to want to see how he wraps it all up.  He clearly disagrees with Romero about humanity.  I enjoyed this book, despite its imperfections, and I agree with other reviewers that if you are a Living Dead fan (as I am), this is a must-read.  FWIW, I really enjoyed his other book, the Zombie Survival Guide, which has none of the flaws of WWZ.  <br />
0425098478|5.0|A very good and thought provoking book. We overlook the obvious every day. Blanchard and Johnson have explained the fundamental secrets (\\"One minute Goal setting\\", \\"One minute Praising\\" and \\" One minute Reprimanding\\")in a very engaging way.  I recommend everybody, especially managers to read this book .This is not a mere  management book, the secrets explained in this book could be applied to our personal lives. <br />-- Chandra Vadamodula <br />
B0000067L2|4.0|In 1967 there were three albums you had to have to be considered Hip! Sargent Peppers lonely heart club band, Are you expierenced? and Disraeli gears.not haven,t listen to Disraeli gears for some 25 years, it took me back in a hurry to the summer of 1967. it still sounds fresh and rocking!. Stange brew is so crisp sounding. the remix really cleared this song up and sounds GREAT!the classic sunshine of your love still makes me move if i want to or not! i gave this c-d a four star rating because some of the songs sound alittle dated. not the classics though! a must have c-d not only for cream fans, but a real piece of music history as well! highly recommended!!!

B000059TEP|5.0|This definitely goes on my list of all-time-favorites.  Demi Moore is beautiful as the grieving girlfriend, while Patrick Swayze projects the appropriate anger, sex appeal, and bafflement as the dead boyfriend, now a ghost.  He badgers Whoopi Goldberg into helping him communicate with Demi.<br /><br />Whoopi is funny!  The scenes between the two lovers (before and after death) are quite touching and romantic.  The action is dramatic and suspenseful as Swayze realizes who had him killed and that Moore is now in danger.<br /><br />Great Movie!
0743298020|5.0|I generally don't read books with high praise from critics, generally because they are never as good as expected. Thankfully I gave this one a chance. Having borrowed the book, I am now purchasing my own copy to read many times over. I was mesmerized from the first five pages and tried to read it slowly so it wouldn't end. This is certainly one of the best books I've ever read and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good story.
0786838655|5.0|Despite the obvious Harry Potter resemblances, The Lightning Thief is a wonderful, original look at Greek mythology that is actually fun. I recently studied the entire Greek section of a mythology book, an endeavor that took about two hours, only to find I would have had to reread it if I had not first read this. So it has practical uses, too!<br /><br />Some parts are obviously derived from the myths of Heracles (Hercules to Romans) and Perseus, Percy's namesake, but there are some truly inspired ideas such as the all-healing nectar that takes on a different flavor depending on who drinks it, the idea that Mount Olympus is now at the top of the Empire State Building, Crusty's Mattresses, Cerberus's ball, Riptide the pen that's a sword, and so many others. (I couldn't pronounce Poseidon for the longest time, though, I thought is was Pose-ee-id-on.)<br /><br />Percy Jackson is, by his own definition, a troubled kid. But he's in no way prepared for the information that he's not just that -- he's a demigod, a hero, the son of not only one of the Olympian gods, but one of the Big Three forbidden to have any more children with mortals: Poseidon, Lord of the Sea, Hades, Lord of the Underworld, and Zeus, Lord of the Sky. (Three guesses what god drowning-immune Percy has as his father.)<br /><br />So after a battle with the  Minotaur that Heracles killed all those years ago in Greece (monsters always resurrect, you see), Percy is ushered to Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods. At first, everything seems great, but when it's discovered that Hades has stolen Zeus's lightning bolt to cause an Olympian war, and Percy is blamed for it -- well, of course he has to set off and put things right. And this includes nothing short of fighting a chimaera disguised as a chihuahua, diving from a skyscraper into the depths of the Hudson River, meeting up with the same dear old Medusa that his namesake defeated ages upon ages ago, traveling to the depths of the Underworld to meet Uncle Hades, and making the unpleasant discovery that maybe the identity of the lightning thief isn't so obvious as it seemed...<br /><br />The highlight of the story is its humor. It really is funny, everything from the chapter titles (I Accidentally Vaporize My Pre-Algebra Teacher; Three Old Ladies Knit the Socks of Death; and I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom come to mind) to Percy's own dry internal monologue. He's just funny.<br /><br />I'm waiting for The Sea of Monsters to come out in paperback, but since The Titan's Curse comes out shortly afterward I don't think I'll be able to wait for the third one in paperback...<br /><br />PS. Sorry. Had to add this. If you read this book for no other reason, read it to see the frequency of the phrase, \\"I uncapped my sword.\\" I mean, really...when are you ever going to get the chance again?<br /><br />Rating: Very Goode unpleasant discovery that maybe the identity of the lightning thief isn't so obvious as it seemed...

B000063JDE|4.0|If you like moives that are different and off the wall then you will like this movie. If you are a David Lynch Fan then this movie is a must for your collection. There are a few scenes that could be classified as disturbing if that bothers you maybe you should skip this movie if not I say go for it.
B00062ZE58|5.0|I got the cd that only has eleven tracks on it, but it's still the same album.  I love the cd!  The music just wraps you up in its strength and beauty and carries you along to a place of magic and wonder.  From songs of lonliness and lost hope, to enchantment by a sorcerer, the album ranges across a variety of stunning subjects.  I think my least favorite song was Angels, because it didn't seem to fit as well, but I loved the rest of the cd.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|Rarely do movies come out that can change people's minds and propel a subject into the political mainstream.  This is one of those movies, and for it to be narrated by Al Gore makes it even more amazing.  The subject of this movie is global warming, and how human behaviors and actions contribute to it.  The movie is based on a slide-show Mr. Gore presents to audiences as he travels around the world, and the video alternates between him presenting his slide-show, and footage of previous events.     Mr. Gore presents several points in this movie.  First, he argues that carbon dioxide levels affect the temperature of the Earth's biosphere, that part of our planet that humans live on, plus the oceans and the atmosphere.  To this affect, he shows time charts spanning tens of thousands of years that correlate the level of CO2 in the atmosphere to the average world wide temperature.  He also presents two videos that explain how greenhouse gases such as CO2 act to heat up the Earth.  One video is serious and the other is funny, but both get the point across in a simple but superficial manner.  As a corollary, he states that the Earth's temperature has been steadily rising in the past century, which matches a rise in the CO2 levels in our atmosphere.      Second, he shows how scientists measure both the temperature, and the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere for a given time period.  This includes footage of scientists drawing and measuring ice core samples.  Between this  point and the first one, the data shown is impressive, the charts are believable, and the analytical methods used by climatologists are well explained.  But, he does not explain how the data obtained by scientists are used to generate the graphs he presents.  For example, he shows a plot of the Earth's temperature over 65,000 years.  But he does not specify what temperature.  Is it the temperature at the North Pole?  Is it the average oceanic temperature?  How fine is the data; i.e. does he have one data point for each year over the past 65,000 years, or is it one data point per decade.  And what is the scatter in the data?  For example, if his chart shows the temperature in the year 2100 BC is 59 degrees F, is this value an average of 100 values, a mean of 39 values, etc, etc?  I am not saying that Mr. Gore is presenting false data, but I do believe that he should have spent an extra 5 - 10 minutes illustrating the data behind the charts in order to make it more believable for the scientifically literate viewer, and more understandable to the layman.    Third, Mr. Gore shows what will happen if atmospheric and oceanic temperatures rise in the amounts predicted by many global warming models.  Specifically, sea levels will rise, ocean currents will change magnitudes and even directions, the location and magnitude of storms such as hurricanes will change, and rainfall patterns will alter around the world.  The effects on human societies will be just as profound.  Many coastal areas will flood, while China and India might get droughts as the Himalayan snows that feed their rivers dry up.  On the other hand, many parts of the world that are now dry will become wetter, thereby increasing the range of mosquitoes and other vectors of tropical and/or waterborne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  And many fertile areas will cease to be arable.    Fourth and most importantly, Mr. Gore compares the problem of global warming with two other problems of recent human memory; the Nazis, and the causation of cancer by smoking.  The latter is personal to Mr. Gore as his family grew up and made a living on a tobacco farm; until his older sister died from lung cancer.  It was this death that convinced the senior Gore to end tobacco farming and Vice President Gore to come out against tobacco cigarettes.  Using both examples, Mr. Gore clearly gets the point across that it is human nature to ignore a problem until it is too late; but this cannot occur with respect to global warming.Fifth, Mr. Gore takes on the critics of global warming by showing two things.  First, he shows how there are thousands of publications on global warming published so far in peer-reviewed journals, which gets the point across that this is a big and well-researched subject.  Second, within a given sample of these publications, not a single one refutes human causation of global warming.  It is this point that is probably most open to contention, and where Mr. Gore could have improved his in-person presentation the most.  Here's how: lets say Mr. Gore is scheduled to speak before an audience of 250 students at university X.  He should come with a stack of 250 different publications from peer-reviewed journals, all of which demonstrate some part of the human causation of global warming. Preferable, Mr. Gore should get review-style articles from several dozen journals.  During the part of his presentation where he states that there is no publication that refutes global warming, he should have his staffers hand out these publications to the audience, one per audience member.  This should take ~5 minutes, meanwhile, he explains that these are some of the publications that support the reality of global warming.  For these 5 minutes, the movie should scroll the names of the same publications across the screen and list each article in the format of article title, authors, journal title and year of publication.  In this way, viewers at home can get some extra reading material, while those watching in person have proof in hand, and can talk to classmates or friends and exchange articles.               So all told, the movie is quite good, though there is not enough science.  Also, there is too much Gore.  This DVD comes with multiple extra features.  My favorite one is an update he provides on recent scientific evidence that has come out to support the existence of global warming.

B000055Y0X|5.0|Going to school and taking drills to hide under your desk from the inevitable nuclear holocaust was traumatic and evidence of the major military propaganda we were doomed to be annihilated.  Our only hope was to bomb the Hell Out of the Russkies before they did.! <br />When Dr. Strangelove came out, it was a breath of fresh air that if we continued to trust the \\"military solution\\" we were indeed doomed to annihilation. <br />Unfortunately we did not learn from history and were to repeat our military bombing solutions.  More bombs were dropped on Vietnam than all of WWII.  Over 4 million Vietnamese were slaughtered in the name of democracy and capitalism. <br />Once again today in Iraq, Iran, etc etc, we are told the solution to people disagreeing with our lifestyle is to bomb and kill them into submission, to make the world safe for democratic dictatorships and American businesses. <br />Dr Strangelove is just as important today, as an absurd black comedy of the American version of safety from terrorism as it was over 40 years ago. <br />Watch it, enjoy, and remember:  \\"People should not fear government, the government should fear the people\\".

0930289455|5.0|Batman:The Killing Joke is Alan Moore's pull no punches story of The Joker's Orgin. Moore does an excellent job of telling this story in only about 60 or so pages. The Killing Joke shows a Joker much different than the Joker many of us are used to seeing in the standard DC Comics and Batman cartoons. Instead Moore shows us a Joker born of and twisted by tragedy. Joker uses his tragic past to justify his psychopathic actions in away that says \\"Life is nothing but a sad joke. So why not laugh\\" He does this by shooting and paralyzing Gordon's daughter and taking very disturbing photographs of her. This scene is very controversial and there is a debate to wether or not Joker raped her. So with that aside. I would not pick up a copy of Killing Joke for your 6 year old nephew. Joker continues to amuse himself by kidnaping Gordon and torturing him both emotionally and physically. The greatest moment in the book is when Batman shows up to rescue Gordon. Batman is all fire and brimstone, ready to due Joker in once and for all, But Gordon, who just had his world torn down around him by Joker is the one who tells Batman that he needs to show Joker \\"that the our way works\\". The way being justice not revenge. I think Gordon's amazing composure was a valuable leasson that Bats needed to learn. Killing joke is the best story written about Joker hands down. If you're a Joker fan you need to read it. check it out.

B00005JNEI|1.0|I bought this out of curiosity. It just proves that only in America can any slob make millions out of badmouthing someone else and not get sued. This guy went into great details to show his ignorance. I truly feel ONE star was an overstated rating, but Amazon's lowest.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|While I fully recognize Oliver Stone's great talents in making films, I avoid his films because I cannot forgive him for \\"JFK\\" and its countless lies that have confused millions about the Kennedy assassination.  However, when my daughter rented this film I thought I would take a look and see what he did with it.  It is magnificent.<br /><br />This is the story of the two officers who were pulled from under the rubble of the Trade Center the day after the buildings fell on them as they were heading to rescue work through the concourse.  John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) was the officer in charge of the team and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) was the rookie.  They, with several others, were pulled off their normal duty and sent to the WTC to help get people out of the buildings.  McLoughlin had a great deal of experience with the buildings because he had worked there before.  Jimeno volunteered to go with him because, as the new guy, he figured he wanted to stay with the guy with the most experience.  The scene as they head into the tower is quite powerful and shows us how dangerous and heroic it was to simply walk or run towards the building.<br /><br />They had just gathered more equipment and were heading towards rescuing some people stuck in the elevators when WTC 2 fell.  They didn't know the second tower had even been hit, but they happened to be in a good place and McLoughlin had the presence of mind to tell his team to run towards a stronger part of the building.<br /><br />I have to admit that I had when I heard two officers had been pulled out of the rubble of the concourse, I had envisioned them being largely OK and simply trapped.  No.  They were pancaked in the rubble.  In the commentary (which I strongly urge you to listen to), Jimeno and the rescuers say it was ten times more constricted than shown in the movie with smoke and dust that made it even more claustrophobic.  However, if they had tried to depict it as it was, there could be no movie, because you couldn't see anything.  Still, the sets help us understand the horrible conditions these men were in.<br /><br />While the story of these men is well known, I don't want to go over the whole story, because no matter what you think you know, it is unlikely that you know the story completely enough to no be shocked at what they went through.  There was a third officer who survived the initial collapse and who did his level best to try and get Jimeno out, but no one could do it without special power equipment.<br /><br />The depiction of what their families went through is also portrayed beautifully.  We get to see up close what it was like for those who waited without knowing, the misinformation that got back to them, and what it was like when they first got the full scope of the truth.<br /><br />Another interesting character is Dave Karnes, who felt called to go down to ground zero to look for survivors.  In the commentary, Jimeno points out that he and no one knew that Karnes was African American until after the film was made and that he felt badly about it.  Even so, Michael Shannon portrays him very well.<br /><br />There is a lot to this story that you will want to know.  And it is very moving.<br /><br />I hope Stone doesn't do the paranoid conspiracist version of 9/11 I heard is preparing to make, but at least that movie would be more in character for him.  This film is beautifully done and shows his artistic powers without his very odd view of the world.<br /><br />Jimeno says that the film does make a few changes to reality because they were making a PG 13 film and that Stone had to compress 24 hours into 2.  Still, others have complained that this or that rescuer or act was not depicted in the film.  Truly, not everyone who should be recognized could be recognized in this or any film.  Still, we are grateful to every one of them.  As you watch with the commentary, Jimeno and the other rescuers point out the real people (including Jimeno and McLaughlin) who were given cameos in the movie.  A very nice touch.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.mended.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|I have to be honest, before I heard the song Capillarian Crest I didn't really care for Mastodon. I heard Remisson thought it was a pretty good album nothing too great about it, then I heard Leviathan. Again pretty good. Then I  heard this album. Immediately I wanted more. The songs are perfectly structured. They are complex yet not too much so that you have trouble following and lose interest. The drumming is top notch as are the guitars. Some highlights from this album are \\"Sleeping Giant\\" \\"Capillarian Crest\\" Colony of Birchmen\\" \\"Hunters of the Sky\\" \\"Pendulous Skin\\". But don't be fooled all songs are great those a just my favorite. A must purchase. I listened to it for a week straight after I purchased it and I was amazed evertime the album played.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|I'm not a fan of war movies.  However, I have to say that *Jarhead* was one of the best war movies, along with *Full Metal Jacket*, *Saving Private Ryan* and a few others.  It is true that *Jarhead* isn't truly a war action movie but it is still a good one to watch.<br /><br />*Jarhead* is an account of Tony Swofford's experiences as a Marine in pre-Desert Storm training as a sniper and the war.  Now, I've never read the book.  I didn't even know there was a book...not that I would read a war book.<br /><br />What I liked about *Jarhead* was that it covered aspects that are not usually covered in other war movies.  One aspect that got the biggest coverage was the fact that the soldiers' wives and girlfriends informed them that they were cheating with other men or divorcing.  It was interesting to see how these soldiers expected it as if it was one of the prices for joining the service and going to war.<br /><br />The other interesting part was seeing the young cocky men cheering and jeering while watching some war reels in a theatre room.  When they actually get sent to Kuwait, there's a complete change in their attitudes.  However, when boredom sets in after a time of inactivity, the cockiness resurfaces.<br /><br />There are so many aspects of the war in the movie.  You're gonna see some interesting punishments meted out.  You'll see some \\"postal\\" moments.  Of course, you'll see the guys bonding and getting on each other's nerves.  Testosterone is at an all-time high.<br /><br />Cinematography here is just really awesome but provocative and taunting as well.  These scenes were there to draw out emotions and reactions from you.  Overall, they'll tell you just how real war was and how high adrenaline and stress were running.  What's interesting is that the gore factor is low (for a war movie)...you're not gonna see blood and body parts flying everywhere.  However, you'll see charred bodies and a couple of other things.<br /><br />The one thing that I liked about this war movie was that it was able to maintain my interest/attention span.  There's so many going on that you're not stuck on one part for a long time.  Despite that there are a few war movies that I liked, I think that *Jarhead* would probably be the first (and only?) war movie that I wouldn't mind seeing again.ed about this war movie was that it was able to maintain my interest/attention span.

B000FVBLEI|4.0|This album is great. I was kind of hesitant to purchase any of this bands albums but boy am I glad I did. The songs are brutal but have nice clean breakdowns as well. The best song and most brutal song in this album by far is Weak Willed. Excellent vocals. In this song Phil delivers great death metal growls. The lyrics on this album are pretty good. The drumming is superb as well as the guitars. If you are a fan of KsE you will probably like this album. If you don't want such a catchy album you might want to try their last one \\"The Darkened Heart\\".
B00026WU64|5.0|This was the first Bob Dylan album and heard and it is still my favorite by a longshot.  It has such a timeless, tranquil, and simplistic feel to it and you would not be able to tell that it is from 1963.  All the songs are great, especially \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"Girl From The North Country\\", \\"Masters Of War\\", and \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\".  All of the songs are practically flawless and you can listen to this album over and over and over again and all the time too; you can put it on when you're going to bed, listen to it as you are cleaning house, listen to it in the car, or while you are going for a walk.  It fits all moods.  It's one of those rare albums that you instantly fall in love with.  It almost makes you wish that Dylan never went electric.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|There are plenty of other reviews that address John Mayer the musician and his music, whether he's the next big thing or a no-talent poseur.  All I can say is listen to the music and make up your own mind.  I'll allow that he's no Stevie Ray Vaughn, at least in terms of the raw urgency of his playing, but then people panned SRV too (esp. his singing) before he sealed his legacy by stepping off this earthly plane.  John Mayer is clearly a multi-talented singer, songwriter and player who's committed to being more than just another pop star and to pushing the limits of his abilities.  I admire that - that's how you grow as a musician and a human being.  My main quibble with this particular CD is the relatively poor sound quality - flat and muddy, as though it was recorded from the third row with a hand-held stereo cassette player (for that matter, I've heard better concerts that were actually recorded this way).  C'mon guys, with today's technology there's no excuse for low-fi concert recordings!
B000063V8R|5.0|To put it simply, if you're a Star Trek fan you'll like this season. If you're not, you'll probably find that some of the episodes are weak on plot or character interaction. However, there are some gems hidden among the these episodes. The Klingon sub-plot gets its starting point here and the season finale is legendary in NextGen canon. Season 3 really begins to reveal what NextGen was really all about. All in all much better than Seasons 1 and 2.
B00005JKG9|1.0|Typical anti-capitalist drivel, no doubt written by an \\"artist\\" who, despite having no relevant experience, automatically assumes that all businesses are scams.  Atrocious dialogue that beats you over the head, relentlessly whining about \\"the leads\\", etc. If you're thinking about watching because of comparisons to Wall Street, just realize that it's like Wall Street...with no Gordon Gekko.

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I can't help but be a little bit biased.  I have been enamored with Mr. Hugh M. Grant for most of my adult life.  I always knew he was quite talented, but this soundtrack certainly adds to my captivation with his capacity as an entertainer.  I happen to enjoy retro-rock, such as Gwen Stefani's \\"Cool\\".  It's fun to go back to the Good Ol' Days of pop.  If you aren't ashamed to admit that you like 80s cheesy music, plus like some of the tunes of the current times, you won't be disappointed in this soundtrack.  The music of yesteryear was popular for a reason...sometimes we like fluffy songs that are catchy and to which we can easily sing along.  I would love to see Hugh break into the Top 40 with some or all of these songs!  He gives George Michael a run for his money, in my opinion.  Oh, and Haley is pretty good, too!
0553582445|4.0|Fool's Errand is the first book of the Tawny Man Trilogy. This is the second series that focuses on Fitzchivalry Farseer, the royal bastard and the world of the Six Duchies.  The first series was called the Farseer trilogy.  It is recommended that one reads the Farseer trilogy before starting this book and series.  However, It is not necessary as Hobb takes care to fill the reader in on the backstory as the book progresses. <br /> <br />As reviewers have noted, the story begins with Fitzchivalry and his wolf companion, Nighteyes fifteen years removed from saving the Six Duchies from the terrors of the outislands Red Ship raiders and the cruel regime of King Regal.  Fitz is living the quiet life with his adopted son Hap, and Nighteyes in a remote cabin.  Fitz has severed most of his ties with those from his past and removed himself from the intrigue and politics of the royal court.  This quiet life is interupted when he gets a visit from his old friend the Fool, who not only looks completely different from his days as a King's fool, but who has assumed the guise of a motley Jamaillian noble known as Lord Golden.  The sole heir to the six duchies throne, Prince Dutiful, is in trouble and the Six Duchies needs his help. <br /> <br />This book centers on the hostile environment that has been created towards the Wit, a magic known by some as \\"beast magic\\", in the wake of King Regal's reign.  Fitz and Dutiful both possess the Wit, as well as \\"the Skill\\" and there are those who would exploit that knowledge.  Fitz must take on a new guise himself in his quest along with Lord Golden. <br /> <br />As one who loved the Farseer trilogy, I was not disappointed in this novel.  Coming back to Fitz and the six duchies was like coming back to an old friend.  Hobb displays her keen insight into humanity and knack for flowing and attentive detail.  This book is a must for any fan of the first trilogy and any fantasy fan, however as I have stated before that although this is an adventure novel, it has a measured pace and spends more time on character development and intrigue. This book does stand alone, and does not leave one feeling as though there is no ending as the first book of the first series does, however it most definitely sets the stage for the second book.  I can tell you that after this book it gets even better.
1582701709|1.0|My title says it all. Give me a break, if a positive mental attitude was all that was needed for success, I would like to see how many of these LofA people are really successful!<br />The truth is that the new age philosophy propagated in this book is just a foreign bird with a local walk, and a selfish one at that. People who are attracted to this are looking to have their spiritual cake and eat their fleshly desires as well. And lets see what the ultimate outcome of such a position is:<br />In India some years ago there was a horrific train crash in which many people died including some Christian missionaries. As they were lying there dying, some of the villagers came up to the train and started stealing their necklaces and purses and running away laughing! When this  became public knowlege, many were outraged at these people's barbaric insensitivity, but do you know what their response was? \\"It must have been their karma that made the train crash, those missionaries must have been bad people in another life so they deserved to be treated in such a way!!!\\"<br />What does that have to do with this book you ask? Well, how about the fact that ultimately The Secret derives it's world view from monistic pantheism which does not and cannot distinguish between good and evil. Evil is called \\"Maya\\" or illusion and if one would only change their mind about the nature of bad or evil things, they would cease to be real!<br />Of course, anyone can see how this leads to evil in itself because true compassion is thrown right out the window ie. \\"dont think about fat people or you may become fat yourself! (paraphrase mine)\\"<br />Instead, why not ground your self in Truth and not on the shifting sands of subjective morality and spirituality. The Secret is nothing more than a path to personal frusteration, disappointment and finally destruction.

0307237699|3.0|After reading this book I am left with the question: What is so unique about Obama's viewpoint? This is the truth, Barack Obama is so popular  right now because he is leftward leaning in the climate of our Bush-hating culture, he is articulate, and he seems on the surface to be slightly bipartisan in his political approach. To me this is so typical of a sly politician. Of course he is going to say what people wanna hear, thats what he does for a living! People need to wake up on both sides of the fence Republican and Democrat, and actually find out what this guy is really going to do when the rubber hits the road.<br /><br />A part in the book that really struck me was when he talked about his \\"Christian\\" faith. He claims to be a Christian but derides other Christians for taking the Bible literally. He says that he is pro-abortion but doesn't give solid reasons why. During an appearance, he walked over to some pro-life people and asked them to share their thoughts with him in order that he might learn their perspective, in the book he recounts what happened: \\"I will pray for you,\\" the protester said. \\"I pray that you have a change of heart.\\" Neither my mind nor my heart changed that day, nor did they in the days to come. But that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own-that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that had been extended to me.\\" Nice and fuzzy!<br /><br />Ok...so the point is to be as ambiguous as possible while sounding nice in the process. I dont know, this guy and his book just rub me the wrong way, I think that America will soon find out that Obama is not the Political savior that he is being made out to be. A \\"Nice Guy\\" with a fit body doesn't equal a great president it's as simple as that.
B000I5X81A|2.0|I've been a great fan of J.J. for some 25 years and possess some 15 of his albums. Also I am a great appreciator of Clapton as a guitarist but not necessarily his albums.

After J.J.'s recent Albums, \\"J.J.Cale Live\\" and \\"To Tulsa and Back\\" (Both 5 Star Albums), this was a real disappointment.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I read some of the other reviews, and I'm frustrated that so many people are finding a problem with Martin Scorcese's sensibilities in adapting a Hong Kong -set thriller to an American venue, using his legendary experience to create a very American \\"original\\". I was immensely entertained, baffled at all the intended times, intrigued at the appropriate times, and thoroughly blown away with the remarkable ending. Others have blabbed away plot-points, and I'm glad I didn't read those reviews before I saw the film.  There's no doubt that Scorcese is deserving of Oscar recognition, and trying to make comparisons to his other films doesn't fly with me. This was a brutal display of some very mean people, but not as gory as \\"Goodfellas\\", not as character driven as \\"Raging Bull\\" and not as gritty as \\"Taxi Driver\\". It WAS, however, a terrific plot-driven narrative, and Mr. Scorcese should be applauded for taking this very complicated story, where each character is constantly affecting the others, and making it coherent.  Nicholson was, indeed, playing a familiar version of Nicholson, so it was a natural choice in casting but no stretch for the great Jack. The 2-disc DVD is fine, with ample interviews with Mr. Scorcese, and other interesting stuff, especially about Bulgar, the guy after which  Nicholson's character was based. Very glad I made the investment. BTW: The sextet from \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\" is by Donizetti, not Puccini.  UPDATE: 2-26-07: I'm glad it won the Oscar.

6305907145|4.0|Patricia Rozema's 1999 screen adaptation of Mansfield Park caused nary a stir in the box office at the time of its release, but Janeites/Austenites and period film lovers (two groups that are by no means interchangeable) have for years internet-battled over whether the film is in fact faithful to Austen's novel. This review is my attempt to help bridge the gap between the two camps. My thesis: Rozema knows and respects the source novel so well that, through clever reconfiguration, she has paid Austen's work due tribute and captured the sprit of, while not Fanny herself, Mansfield Park and its other inhabitants.     Having read all of Jane Austen's major works and some of her juevenilia and letters, and having first read and re-read said works before viewing any screen adaptations of them, I am suitably acquainted with Austen and her milieu. However, I am not so Austen-centric as to consider myself a Janeite, and I am an all-around lover of the cinema; I thus fall as much as possible into the informed \\"middle.\\"      Note: I will NOT be reviewing this movie's aesthetic and film merits, which are many. In particular, Lesley Barber's excellent piano-based score and Michael Coulter's deft cinematography are reason enough to see the film. Also, if you dismissed the \\"slavery song\\" over the credits (Salif Keita's \\"Djonga\\") as too postmodern or activist or anachronistic, don't overlook this song, which, from a musical perspective, stands on its own merits.     I first saw Rozema's film in the early 2000's. However, at that time, I had not (re)-read Mansfield Park in about ten years, so the book was not fresh in my mind, leading to my initial conclusion that the picture was indeed a very liberal (read: unsatisfactorily divergent) adaptation of Austen's work. But I have enjoyed the movie more and more over the years, and felt it was time to re-read MP with the film in mind.     Having just re-read MP this past week and re-screened the movie and its commentaries, I am happy toreport that Rozema's Complete Divergences--that is, places in which she presents information or characters that appear either fabricated or directly at odds with Austen's own-- are in fact few, and less reprehensible than they may at first seem.     Here, as I see them, are the Complete Divergences:     1. *Fanny Price, external personality and employment*  Austen's novel: Fanny appears to be a physically fragile, perhaps overly-prudent young woman who is a bit too anxious to please and a bit too hasty to forgo the limelight, even when she is deserving of it. Fanny spends much of her time fetching tea and other things for her aunt Bertram; any stolen moments of freedom are employed in reading biographies, histories, and non-risque novels.   Rozema's external Fanny: a hardy and hale horse-racing lass who views herself primarily as a budding writer a la a young Jane Austen, penning letters, short stories, and biographies which she shares with a choice few. This Fanny, although still conscious of her low position in the family hierarchy, is more quick to speak up for herself and on behalf of others (slaves, for example).      2. *Susan and William Price, Fanny's siblings*  Austen's novel: William, a young naval recruit, is Fanny's beloved elder brother, to whom she writes often and who unwittingly figures into some plot points. Susan is the blunt-talking, assertive but amiable younger sister who becomes Fanny's protégée.   Rozema: excises William and, likely for the sake of screenplay economy, folds him into Susan's character, producing one cherished sibling to whom Fanny writes. In the book, William is essentially a cipher for Fanny's feelings, so this works fine.     3. *Dr. And Mrs. Grant of the Parsonage at MP*  Rozema has also excised this pair of peripheral characters.     4. *Aunt Norris' Cheapness*  The delightfully mooching, liberal-with-everybody's-money-but- her-own Aunt Norris of Austen's novel has a reduced role in Roxema's picture, likely due to runtimeconcerns.     5. *Julia's Elopement*  Glossed over in Austen's book, this elopement was completely cut out of Rozema's screenplay.     6. *References to Slavery*  Again, glossed over in Austen's book: Fanny tells Edmund that she asked Sir Thomas about the slave trade (at that time, Britons were debating over the international abolishment of slavery) but we do not see her questioning him, and nobody issues an outright polemic against the institution. Thus, we know both Austen, her contemporary readers, and her MP characters are well aware of West Indies slavery and its likely relation to the Bertram family's estate in Antigua; however, we do not see inside any one's character head or hear their voices on the issue. Rozema, of course, has in her movie brought the issue front and just-peripheral-of-center.     7. *Adultery on MP premises*  The adultery scene onto which Rozema's heroine stumbles did not take place at Mansfield Park. In the novel, all of \\"Mrs. R's and Mr. C's\\" sexual liaison takes place off-scene in other parts of England, and is only reported on in a newspaper and by third parties.     8. *Henry's Wooing of Fanny*  Austen's Henry Crawford does not rejoice in the hasty betrothal acceptance proferred by Rozema's Fanny/Jane Austen alter-ego (Jane Austen once accepted and then refused a suitor in the same way). No starlings or other birds were sent to Fanny in Portsmouth (see below).      Of the above changes, the most notable is Fanny Price's character. However, note that while Rozema has greatly altered the external Fanny (fragile tea-fetcher and put-upon Girl Friday), Frances O'Connor's portrayal of the inner Fanny--the passionate, sensitive young woman with a core of steel--nonetheless is spot-on in terms of Austen's characterization. Austen's heroine is a socially-skittish wallflower who, having allowed herself to be worn down and belittled by her wealthier, self-important relations, is all too happy to remain on the sidelines, where she feels deeplyevery slight, articulating to the reader her powerful emotions.  Yet Austen's Fanny finds the will and the strength to flat-out defy the threats, cajolements, and harangues of an imposing Uncle, meddling Aunt, and a smooth-talking brother-and-sister duo intent on Fanny's marriage to a man she neither loves nor trusts. Rozema and O'Connor faithfully bring to life this Fanny; witness O'Connor's shaky but defiant \\"I will NOT\\" to Harold Pinter's Sir Thomas.     The second most visible change is the emphasis on slavery which, again, was something Austen clearly--though briefly--referenced in her book. Rozema has probably erred in turning Sir Thomas into an unrepentant and brutal slavemaster who sexually abused his female slaves. THAT is, I will allow, a bit of a stretch, especially given the reconciliatory changes Austen confers on his character toward the end of the novel, and Fanny's growing respect and fondness for him. I think Rozema could have compromised by showing Fanny discovering a book of slave logs or receipts in Sir Thomas' study. Remember that the novel is all about captivity, and that the Bertram children and Fanny are all, in their own ways, like slaves, like starlings who \\"can't get out\\" from under their powerful father's expectations.     Speaking of starlings, let's talk about the numerous, delightful little ways in which Rozema culls bits and pieces from the novel and convincingly reworks them. For example, although Austen's Henry does not, like Rozema's,  read the starling-poem with Fanny--in fact, in the novel, it is Maria who invokes the bird imagery--Rozema recognizes that Fanny, like Austen's Maria, would also resonate with the idea of birds in captivity, and works that reference into Fanny's scenes instead. Yet Rozema does not strip the ascription from Maria, who in both the film and book outright states, \\"I can't get out.\\"    In re-reading this book with the film in mind, I was astonished at how much of the screenplay is lifted wholesale from Austen's narrative, turned into dialogue, and assigned, appropriately, to characters. Returning to the movie Maria: her entire speech to her father, in which she resigns herself to a loveless marriage, is taken, verbatim, from several paragraphs in the novel revealing Sir Thomas' own thoughts. Similarly, in the novel, Mary Crawford writes a letter to Fanny in which she reveals her mercenary interest in Tom's death and Edmund's possible promotion to heir-apparent. Later in the novel, we learn from Edmund that Mary has revealed even more appalling bad taste by wishing marriage on the wayward adulterers and wanting to bring them back into the Mansfield fold. Rozema capitalizes on the dramatic potential of this letter and hearsay by giving us a scene in which Mary says all the exact same things, only to the Bertrams'--and the audience's--face.     Other little touches are simply Austen's characterizations exaggerated and magnified for the screen. Rozema, for example, takes the novel's unbelievably indolent and spacy and \\"out-to-lunch\\" Lady Betram and shows us her over-fondness for imbibements of the \\"medicinal\\" kind. I think this is a clever way to add to the characterization of a character that, in the novel, is not assigned sufficient causation   (Austen mentions in passing that both Lady Bertram and her sister Price are indolent and thoughtless \\"by nature,\\" while Aunt Norris just happens to be an industrious hyper-organizer).     Oh, and that horse Rozema's Fanny races? It's called Shakespeare, owing to novel-Fanny's love for the Bard, and how, in the novel, Edmund observes Fanny's pleasure in the recitation of Shakespeare's plays. The horse, like the gold chain that was not included in the movie, demonstrates Edmund's underlying regard for Fanny.     A multitude of other examples exists to convince the skeptical viewer that, in fact, Rozema's Mansfield Park is a more than acceptable version of Austen's--it is Austen's fictional world, condensed for the screen but conscientiously so, divergent in some details but not without due reason or inspiration, and yielding surprisingly successful results.     In short, even avowed Janeites owe it to Jane's novel and her characters--and yes, as Rozema points out, her life--to explore this movie and compare it side by side with the book. Don't do as I did and dismiss this picture as \\"unfaithful\\" without having read the book within a year of first screening the movie. In fact, I suggest watching the movie one weekend, and then picking up the novel (whether for the first time or, like me, for the fifth) and reading it with the movie still fresh in your mind. I think you will be pleasantly surprised,     Rozema not only clearly knows this novel inside and out, but she enjoys and admires it; I believe a director-screenwriter on less intimate terms with the book would have produced a movie perhaps more \\"faithful\\" to the surface actions of Austen's characters than to, like Rozema's Mansfield Park, their inner lives and emotional states.
B000000H6D|4.0|Type O Negative were an interesting band, and here they make a turning point album. Less of the thrash roots of Carnivore and more of a gothic sound are put in. Many of the songs are very long, and while some have talked about it being cheesy and campy, I actually find that's part of the record's charm. The sense of humor in some places is not politically correct in the least (\\"Kill All the White People,\\" \\"We Hate Everyone\\") and even in other things, like trying to keep negative. The back of the CD has something inside that says \\"Don't mistake lack of talent for genious\\" and the like, and for some reason that stuff kinda cracks me up. But make no mistake: They play really well. <br /> <br />The greatest songs on here, by and large, are the first two full songs: \\"Christian Woman\\" and \\"Black No. 1,\\" both TON classics. \\"CW\\" is kind of like four tracks in one, and the keyboards and melody are both really memorable. My personal favorite is \\"Black,\\" with its crunchy riffs and harpsi-chord-sounding part before the coda. The title track is also great. Although not really an album I am always revisiting in full, I usually do get something out of listening to this. Unfortunately though, I find it more rewarding to listen in snippets than in full. <br /> <br />I think if you like goth and metal that this record will work well for you. Excellent release.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This is the type of movie you only used to see outside of Hollywood.  In a way its refreshing to see a film like this with big name stars.  Its got a little bit of everything, and enough of it to keep most viewers happy. <br /> <br />The movie is shot with very well with a mix of shots to capture the road film aspects of the movie and more intimate framing for dramatic moments.  In a way the movie puts you in as a observer of the actions, never letting you get too close so that the absurd moments don't move into the disturbing realm. <br /> <br />This works great since the actors are playing this film relatively straight.  The entire case from veteran Alan Arkin to newcomer Abigail Breslin do an excellent job.  The characters are believable in their own world, and even though we laugh with them (and at them) they never feel untrue.  The cast has a great script to work with.  The mix of comedy and drama is perfect, and while tragedy occurs during the film, we are left feeling good about the outcome. <br /> <br />The music (song and score) are perfect accompaniments and make me want to seek out the soundtrack.  Of course a certain Rick James song is going to have a whole new meaning for me. <br /> <br />Are there any downsides to the movie?  Just a few.  Since you are watching a road movie, you kinda know what to expect.  This movie follows the same path, there is a deadline and our heroes have to navigate around a whole set of outlandish situations.  There are no \\"wacky\\" encounters during the film.  In fact most of the encounters are with normal people (but some of them or overly rude, or insensitive).  Our main cast are the ones who could be labeled \\"wacky\\". <br /> <br />Overall a very entertaining film.  Its one I'd watch again, but not quite good enough for me to add to my collection.  Definitely a good rental for someone looking for a good nights entertainment with a dash of dark humor and quirky characters. <br /> <br />(If at all possible try to avoid seeing any ads for the movie.  Once again, the marketing  gives away some of the funniest scenes in an effort to sell the film.  Some of these are better left as surprises.)
B000BVD460|4.0|You know something I've noticed, whenever they make a greatest hits album of anybody they'll always put a couple of unreleased tracks on the disk to make people buy it, because they know we live in the days of iTunes, and so on, and those people who have all the albums can make their own greatest hits CD.  <br /> <br />It's kind of obvious FACK and Shake That are studio left overs from Encore.
0895260131|5.0|Even before September 11 I was struggling to understand Islam.  It's surprising that I even bought this book.  I was afraid that it would be a poorly researched attack by a wild eyed bigot.  But the multiple positive reviews convinced me to give it a try.  If, after reading the book, I still considered the author unfair or racist in any way I would give it only one star.    You cannot understand Islam simply by reading this book.  That was not the author's intention.  He simply wanted to \\"set the record straight,\\" to counter many common popular myths.  It was written as a reaction to the many contradictory descriptions of Islam in the media. Many seem to think that all religions are basically the same in respect to violence, attitude toward \\"non-believers,\\" the place of women, and so on. This book disproves that notion.    Robert Spencer carefully and methodically discusses many common misconceptions about Islam, Christianity, Muhammad, Jesus, and the Crusades.  He quotes original sources extensively, and takes great pains not to distort or \\"spin\\" his descriptions of the two religions, the holy books, and the religions' attitudes towards violence, conversion, women, and world outlook.    The author anticipated and addresses many criticisms.  He takes great care to back up all of his major assertions with frequent quotations from primary sources, without taking them out of context.  He works hard to prove that he is not \\"cherry picking\\" quotations from the Koran and other Islamic sources that will offend Western readers.  The careful research and scholarship are undeniable.    So, if you are like me, this book is a challenge.  For instance, the book asserts that Islam is uniquely intolerant toward nonbelievers, unlike other major religions.  The book documents how Islam encourages, even mandates maltreatment, humiliation of, and violence towards \\"infidels.\\"  But, I believe in knowing the truth.  I don't want to kid myself about what my own religion is about, nor others.  I also believe that the author is sincere, honest, and generally accurate.    On the negative side, with all due respect to the author, the digs at President Clinton seemed gratuitous and out of place.  Still, I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to understand Islam fully.
B00004XONN|5.0|Okay, I have only listened to 4 or 5 Radiohead albums, but I own 3 and this one blows the others away.  Not a hard rocking album, it often drifts into ambient techno bliss, but that is why I bought it.  As an ambient sounding pop album it really hits the mark with a transcendently weird style reminiscent of Pink Floyd in their trippier moments. <br /> <br />A great album for relaxing or creating your own vision quests.

It gets you excited about your life and your possibilities.

0790737345|5.0|Beautifully filmed and acted.  Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are both breathtaking.  I liked the fact that the angels weren't cliche'...no wings and not dressed all in white.  It was great the way an angel's 'fall' was not into evil, but into life.  Loved that their 'fall' was just that, a real fall.  And the fact that such a fall would kill a human being, but give an angel LIFE.  Incredibly beautiful symbolism.  It was wonderful that a surgeon who tried so hard to save lives, was able to see the beauty in death.  Unfortunately it was HER death.  But I still couldn't feel that the movie had an unhappy ending.  This movie is almost too beautiful for words.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is the best album that the Rolling Stones ever recorded. They had found their identity with a hybrid sound of blues, country and hard rock. The subject matter is dark. Images of junkies, serial killers, war mongers, and hard drugs form a decadent, nihilistic atmosphere. But it is appropriate as this album summed up the filming of the ominious movie \\"Performance\\", the death of Brian Jones, and Keith's long descent into heroin oblivion...<br /><br />Best tracks: \\"Gimme Shelter\\", \\"Monkey Man\\", \\"Midnight Rambler\\", \\"Let it Bleed\\", \\"You Got the Silver\\".

1582701709|5.0|\\"The Secret\\" is suitable for anyone with an open mind.  <br /> <br />Similar to \\"who moved my cheese\\" the movie <br /> <br /> Not only is it ideal for novices due to the concepts being presented in a transparent and enjoyable manner, but it also satisfies advanced students of metaphysics because the execution is so delightfully original and insightful. Fans of \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" will undoubtedly find \\"The Secret\\" even more enjoyable because in comparison, the latter is more focused, concise, and thorough. <br /> <br />I heartily recommend \\"The Secret\\" to anyone interested in transcending limitations and shifting to a higher state of existence

0140285601|5.0|What Kurt Vonnegut can do with the written word amazes me.  Cat's Cradle is both a rambling diatribe of apt social observations and a finely crafted novel at the same time.<br /><br />Centering around a dead man, Felix Hoenikker, the scientist credited as being the father of the atomic bomb, the story reflects on the lack of social responsibility of a society so invested in killing and war that consequences aren't measured. This man, Hoenikker, didn't just create the most powerful WMD ever used, Vonnegut also suggests that he created a substance that could teach water molecules to bond in a new way - a way in which life on earth couldn't process.  ICE-9 is this substance and the narrator stumbles through the story knowing of the substance but not knowing its true significance as he tries to unravel the events of the day of the bombing of Hiroshima,<br /><br />Another social statement of the book is in regard to religion.  Inventing Bokononism, a belief system of total falsehoods with punishments for disobedience merely to make the religion seem more important, the protagonist brings order where there was never order needed before.  It cuts to the heart of organized religion and satirically shows that manipulation of belief and twisting of the social construct are necessary to build a classed society.  Brilliant.<br /><br />Throughout the story, a wide cast of disparate characters rush past, unconnected - - but for Vonnegut this is merely a ruse - -  they are all tied together by the end in an intricate web of cause and effect, of influence and reason.<br /><br />I don't know if this was my favorite Vonnegut novel, because the one I'm reading always seems like the best one at that moment.<br /><br /> - CV Rick
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" is a wonderful surprise!  It was much better than I expected; I don't understand why the reviews didn't reflect the fantastic film-making we're treated to here.  The entire cast is great; Edward Norton does his usual excellent job as Eisenheim the Illusionist; Paul Giamatti is superb as the Police Captain assigned to investigate Eisenheim; Jessica Biel gives a lovely performance as Countess Sophie, Eisenheim's long-time love; and Rufus Sewell is approriately hateful as the evil Prince.  The sepia-toned photography is perfect for the era depicted, as is the wonderful lighting.  The musical score fit the story and era like a glove.<br /><br />Would someone please explain to me why this film didn't get the rave reviews it deserved!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is an excellent little romantic drama, with a bit of the thriller thrown in for good measure, replete with fine performances and a suspenseful, witty script.  The costume and set design create the perfect Vienna, and, by way of some very creative lighting, the cinematography shines superb.  Worth repeated viewings, especially for the \\"twist\\" ending.  A+++
B00005OCMR|3.0|When I saw \\"Tron\\" in the theater with a friend, the title of this review made him laugh for two minutes. He was a computer tech for the Department of Defense and got the joke immediately. <br /> <br />Tron suffers for that. Many of the jokes were a little too inside for anyone not computer savvy (remember, this was the early '80's). Having said that, the film is fun and worth owning. It was slightly controversial for Disney using the music of Wendy Carlos. You'll have to look elsewhere to see why THAT was an issue. <br /> <br />Buy it and enjoy it. ; )
B000M4RG42|1.0|This could've been, and SHOULD have been, a great story about everyday Americans who were heroic and rejected the label.  Or about corporate media frenzy and just how far we'll all go to perpetuate a myth.  On the plus side, this film has great acting and superb cinematography-reminiscent of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" in it's harrowing depictation of the horrors of war.  Unfortunately, that's it. The multi-layered characterization of our \\"heroes\\" is rendered dull and one dimensional. (We're not sure about their motivations, and worse yet, we don't even get a chance to care). Even one character's bout with alcoholism is rendered lifeless and boring...Believe me, like you, I WANTED to like this movie, but the directing, editing, script, and overall flow made it impossible.  This is just another example of how all the money in the world won't save us from incompetant direction and poor, incoherent and choppy scripting.  Too bad.
B000FGGE68|3.0|I heard a review of this film by a critic who had panned Aeon Flux. He said \\"Ultraviolet\\" made him yearn for that film. No, the film isn't THAT bad. It is fun, lightweight entertainment. Milla Jovovich has fun with this - her soliloquy at the end is charmingly hokey and designed to make us yearn for a sequel. I confess....I wouldn't mind seeing Violet pound the cream cheese out of some more bad guys. <br /> <br />Fun for any fans of \\"chop socky\\" films.
032147404X|4.0|This book was great for learning little tricks to improve your digital pictures. It is written in easy to understand language without a lot of jargon. I would recomend this book to anyone who is looking to learn more about digital photography.
0790731894|2.0|Although there are a few good scenes to keep you interested, much of the screenplay is hard to believe and a lot of the dialogue is typical Hollywood hype. Halle Berry is actually one of the best acted roles in this otherwise overblown terrorist saga; the terrorists are more believable than the stars. <br /> <br />The roles of Oliver Platt, John Lequizamo and Joe Morton are poorly written, with the honors of stupid lines being attributed to Lequizamo. I'm not sure what possesses people to like his over the top portrayals. He always plays his roles as if he is the most important one in the film. Didn't he ever hear of subtlety? <br /> <br />Oliver Platt, another throw-away part given absurd lines, the same for poor Joe Morton, an actor who deserves more than he is usually given. He plays solid supporting parts, but here his part is ridiculous.  <br /> <br />As for the planting of the bomb on Morton and the various efforts to defuse it, all ridiculous. Can't they ever think of something that makes sense. It's like watching an episode of \\"24\\". <br /> <br />Kurt Russell, a good actor whose movies are never \\"A\\" efforts. So much sweat and strain over so little.  <br /> <br />The film is basically a Jerry Bruckheimer epic, have you ever seen ConAir? <br />Similar in their ethos and forgettable in their presentation. As I said, Halle Berry actually was convincing in her role and the terrorists would be the only reason to see the film. It is typical Hollywood all the way.
0061150142|4.0|I thought The Pact was captivating and very easy to read. I couldn't put it down. Jodi really captured the love between two people and developed the characters in the book so that I felt as if I knew them personally.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mystery & love story intertwined.

0743298020|5.0|As a child, I was introduced to the novels of the Bronte sisters, Austen, Dickens, and Hardy--and I remember the pleasure in immersing myself in their worlds for hours at a time.  Diane Setterfield's novel The Thirteenth Tale transported me back to those pleasurable moments when I escaped into stories and lost myself in them. The novel stands as a love letter to readers and the act of reading, and it was a pleasure to be reminded of what fun losing myself in a novel could be.     While The Thirteenth Tale is a homage to nineteenth century novels and authors, it stands on its own as a distinctly modern twist on the gothic novel.  The novel's central preoccupation is the search for family--more specifically, the search for your soulmate, your twin self.  I was particularly impressed with the author's use of tone and imagery--the cold, barren landscape of the Yorkshire moors and the overgrown, barely tended gardens were a perfect backdrop for the lonely, sterile existences of the novel's central characters.  The novel marries well the atmospherics and passions found in stories like Jane Eyre (a novel that features significantly in The Thirteenth Tale) with the complexities and confusion of the contemporary world.    I highly recommend this novel--especially to those voracious readers who     are willing to put off all mundane errands and to clear the appointment calendar for the sake of a good book.
0876855575|5.0|I was hoping I'd like this book, and I was not one bit disappointed!  It's both funny & sad, direct yet thoughtful, and compellingly readable.  I read the last 160 pages in one sitting, couldn't put it down.  It made me laugh and it made me cry, but Bukowski never gets melodramatic. <br /> <br />I'd seen reviewers here say things like, \\"Bukowski's just an alcoholic with a typewriter,\\" but that is complete BS.  His writing style is so direct and honest, so sober (ironically!) that it might SEEM simple to write like he does, but if that's that case, then why have I read so few books as good as this one?  I saw another reviewer claim that this book has a lot of unrealistic bragging, specifically about a boxing incident.  That reviewer is the one who exaggerated things, Bukowksi seems to stick up for himself when needed, but he also admits getting his butt kicked when it happens.  Most of the time Bukowski is the loser, and he talks about feeling like an outcast. <br /> <br />I can barely wait to read all of Bukowksi's other novels.  What a great book.  I'm so glad I came across the documentary about him, _Born Into This_--a great film about a great writer!  Definitely check this book out.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|Her chameleon-like persona has always been a big part of Madonna's mystique. Throughout her dazzling, spectacular \\"Confessions\\" show, Madonna plays many different roles: Disco dominatrix (\\"Future Lovers\\"), Acrobat (\\"Like a Virgin\\"), Martyr (\\"Live to Tell\\"), Glam Rock Star (\\"I Love New York\\") and many others.<br /><br />However, there is a point, about halfway through the show, where Madonna performs a mostly acoustic version of \\"Paradise (Not For Me). Sitting on a stool and strumming a guitar, Madonna appears as a middle-aged, slightly melancholy singer-songwriter. And it's the role that seems the most truthful and appealing.
B000051Y0G|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I heard \\"Girls (Just Wanna Have Fun)\\" It was 1983 and I was just out of Junior High. I thought it was a bit cheezy at first but then it grew on me. Still does, in fact. Then I bought the cassette. When I heard \\"Money Changes Everything\\" I was mezmoried. WOW! This album rocks. There were times when listening to the entire album a few times in a row was not unusual. So when it came time that I bought a cd player this was one of the first albums I got. All of the songs on here are classic 1980's. Even her little diddy \\"He's So Unusual\\" is great, complete with 1930's style. \\"Time After Time\\" still brings a tear to my eye with it's haunting backround and wonderfully sung vocals. This is Cyndi's defeying moment! But my favorite track has to be \\"She Bop\\" With it's classic 80's style synth and Bangles influencing chorus this track rocks. Way to go Cyndi. You have created a masterpiece!!
B00005JPFO|5.0|\\"Ghost Rider\\" is great! Nicolas Cage (Academy Award winner for his work in \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" (1995) as Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider is great.

The music by Christopher Young (who also did the upcoming \\"Lucky You\\" (2007) & \\"Spider-Man 3\\" (2007) is great. The cinematography by Russell Boyd (who won the Oscar for his work on \\"Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World\\" (2003) & John Wheeler is great.

The set decoration by Suza Maybury (who also did the set decoration to \\"Stealth\\") is great. The costume design by Lizzy Gardiner (who also did the costume design to \\"Stealth\\") is great. The visual effects are great. An great comic-book movie that is in spirit of the comic book itself.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|This album, after only two listens has left me \\"Breathless\\".  I have not heard a recording like this in a very long time.  The comparisons to Norah Jones and Alicia Keys as well as Billie Holliday are all somewhat fair especially if you are trying to give a sense of the feel of these tracks to someone who has not yet heard them.  I would also submit Anita Baker into the mix, and at times I even thought I'd heard D'Angelo sitting in with his signature organ and his background vocalists.  Take all of the names thrown out in this stream of reviews, put them into a blender, set to puree, and you've got a good idea of the general flavor of this album.  Yet at the same time, you have not heard anything quite like it.  Corinne brings a voice that is truly distinct and beautiful.  It is simple, understated, soft, emotional, and above all, dripping wet with raw soul.  Luther Vandross, among others, proved that sometimes a voice does not need to overpower you, it can speak softly and yet still carry a big stick.  Through her pitch, soul, and subtleties, Corinne can drive home the same point just as powerfully as any acrobatic R&B artist.  If her voice is the paint brush, then it is gliding gracefully over a canvass of jazz-inspired soulful melodies painting a scene I've not heard in quite some time.  Her songs take advantage of gorgeous and haunting progressions and hooks, some of which will faintly echo things you may have heard before (hence the comparisons), and yet the direction in which she takes them and the jazzy soulful tilt of her vocals provide unexpected twists and turns that will keep you engaged and keep the melodies stirring in your mind.  I've been looking for soul prepared, cooked and served this way for a long time, and since this is a first album, I am truly looking forward to hearing much more from Corinne Bailey Rae.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|In Genesis Chapter 11 it is said that men, unified under one common language, decided to build a tower that would reach to the heavens, proving that they were greater then God.  They were to call this tower Babel.  God, sensing that united nothing would be impossible for them, confused their languages to prevent the tower from being finished.  Years later people have found the ability to learn other languages but the language barriers still causes lots of problems.  None the least of which is in \\"Babel,\\" where a lack of communication manages to cause much grief due to simple misunderstandings.  Like \\"Crash\\" from the year before, \\"Babel\\" is not a straightforward movie.  It revolves around four storylines in three countries: Mexico, Morocco, and Japan.  All these stories are connected, though it may take time for this to become obvious.  The first storyline revolves around two Moroccan teenagers who are playing with a gun their father just bought in order to protect their flock of sheep.<br /><br />While shooting at a tour bus, they accidently shoot an American tourist (played by Cate Blanchette), which leads to the most obvious story connection in the movie.  Blanchette's husband is played by Brad Pitt, who now has a wife dying of a gunshot wound, and no means of medical support.  This in turn makes the family late in returning home to the states, where the family maid Amelia (Adriana Barraza) decides to take the children to Mexico with her so that she can attend her sons wedding, and finds herself having difficulty getting back into the States at the borderline.  Then we hop over to Japan, where we follow a deaf girl played by Rinko Kikuchi, who feels distanced from her father (Koji Yakusho) and tries solicit her body for sex in a sadly misguided attempt at finding happiness.  The connection between these stories involve everything, and yet nothing at all.<br /><br />If that doesn't make much sense, let me elaborate a bit.  All these stories connect to one main thread.  This much is obvious, otherwise there would be no reason to have the four stories in the first place.  How they all connect is what makes it interesting.  Each one of these individual stories would work well as it's own movie, but is instead molded into one single narrative.  Like \\"Crash\\" and \\"Syriana\\" you need to pay close attention to all the storylines, as this movie is like a jigsaw puzzle: Putting together piece by piece until you get the whole picture in plain view.  If you don't have the patience for this type of film making, then it's suggested you skip this movie and watch something less complicated.  Though I was a fan of \\"Syriana\\" and an even bigger fan of \\"Crash,\\" I do admit my enthusiasm for this type of film making is wearing just a little bit thin.  It was a novel idea with those two movies, but now I'm getting tired of the whole thing.<br /><br />The one problem you have with these types of movies is that you can't really delve into the storyline of characters with too much detail.  The storyline because it makes no sense outside of a basic summery, and the characters because the characterizations aren't always there.  There is a huge conflict with the screenplay when it comes to the storyline revolving around the deaf Japanese teenager.  Rinko Kikuchi's storyline is the most heartbreaking of the four.  It's the most difficult role to play, and it's conclusion is very bittersweet.  Since this storyline is the emotional high point of the movie though, it's troublesome that this storyline has two huge problems with it.  The first problem is the sexual content in this storyline borders on exploitation despite it's necessity in telling the story.  The second problem is that the Japanese storyline is the weakest link to the whole structure, and could have been completely cut from the movie without anyone noticing that anything was even missing (the only point the Japanese storyline serves is to show that the gun used by the Moroccan boys was given tothe father by the girls father).<br /><br />The fact that the most emotional storyline is easy expendable shows that this movie could have used more heart.  The storyline surrounding the Moroccan boys sets off the whole storyline, yet that storyline is the least emotionally involved.  The caretakers trip through the dessert is emotionally involving, yet one wonders whether or not the movie could have survived without it.  Obviously the most important storyline in the movie is that of Brad Pitt, who is desperately trying to save his dying wife with nothing to work with.  On a whole, I guess \\"Babel\\" works as a mild curiosity.  Watching the movie certainly won't result in boredom, but how does one go back to a movie that adds up to one thing: That someone pulled the trigger and due to a lack of communication in the languages there was chaos.  It's an interesting question to be sure, and one wonders whether or not the film maker would have been better off making a film trilogy instead of forcing three movies into one.  It's a good movie, but I can certainly live if I never see it again.<br /><br />Rating: *** starsven to the father by the girls father). <br /> <br />The fact that the most emotional storyline is easy expendable shows that this movie could have used more heart.

6305907145|1.0|I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book. <br /> <br />The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste.

B0000029AP|5.0|Aerosmith is a real enigma in rock history;  a band that was nothing short of brilliant in its first era through \\"Night In The Ruts\\", and the original line-up reformation of \\"Done With Mirrors\\" that turned into a cliche of themselves.<br /><br />  Not that it mattered - new listeners dug \\"Permanent Vacation\\" and the new crop of albums, while the old school hated the new work.  Aerosmith is rich beyond their wildest dreams, and probably doesn't care about the opinions of the fans who brought them into prominence in the first place.<br /><br />  \\"Toys In The Attic\\" was the third release for this Boston band, and the Stones/Yardbirds hybrid sound coalesced into their own style that was only hinted at on the first two releases.  The title track rips, and the blues swing hard on \\"Uncle Salty\\" and \\"Adam's Apple\\", a funny story of the Garden of Eden.  The classic \\"Walk This Way\\" follows, with its funky rhythms and impossible to not love guitar riff.  Tyler's lyrics are smart, witty and urban.  It can be said that rappers and hip-hop musicians probably learned a lot from his lyric style, the re-making of the tune with Run-DMC providing proof of that argument, although the original is far better.<br /><br />  \\"Toys In The Attic\\" isn't the toughest Aerosmith - that would come next with the unbelievable \\"Rocks\\" album.  It is probably, however, the best songwriting the band did overall.<br /><br />  This, \\"Rocks\\" and the first two albums, \\"Aerosmith\\" and \\"Get Your Wings\\" are the best the band had to offer, and that was a lot.  Too bad they've resorted to cheap Rich Little impersonations of themselves and released way too many hits packages.  Time to call it a day, boys.
0553583182|5.0|This book is simple and I am applying its techniques. The author describes when happens with our mind, with our inner voice, with the need to pray. At first I was very skeptical of this book, but I am applyingit and it really does work, which is kind of weird as well. Read this book. Its short and to the point.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I've been waiting so long to get this TV show on DVD. <br />It is just awesome!!!
B000HT386M|3.0|You either love Adam Sandler or you hate him. I'm sitting on the fence as far it's concerned when it comes to him. Yes I find him irritating him, but I also love 50 First Dates and Duplex (as it's known in the USA). I borrowed this from a friend, thinking it was gonna be an Adam Sandler film that doesn't have Drew Barrymore that I can give a bad review.<br /><br />The first half of the film is your standard Adam Sandler. Not funny jokes, David Hasselhoff being a parody of himself, Jennifer Coolidge playing a role she's playing a million times before but with less screen time, and Kate Beckinsale playing wallpaper that screams at the lead character occasionally.<br /><br />It's the second half of the film where it really kicks into gear, and I recommend staying until at least this point before deciding whether you love or hate the film. Without giving too much away, the universal remote control remembers the points that Adam's character skipped, and his life takes on a whole new meaning as he fights to control it.<br /><br />The film completely changes direction at this point, and has led to comparisons to It's A Wonderful Life, which I haven't seen, but everyone seems to rave about it. It becomes surprisingly emotional, and touching.<br /><br />I have to say that Click is one of Adam Sandler's best films and completely different to the trailer. It allows Adam to extend the normal goofy character he plays, to something more dramatic. It does seem similar to Bruce Almighty at some points, and does have some bad jokes that no one laughs at - the dog and the toy duck for example - but it's actually (and I'm shocking myself by saying this) an Adam Sandler movie WORTH seeing.
B00005JPCD|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"Happy Feet\\", so I'm kind of surprised by the reviews I've read on here. The movie starts off cute and funny in the beginning and becomes dreary towards the middle, but it does brighten back up at the end. A few of the songs being sung by the penguins  were inappropriate. Even though it was mating season, there are thousands of appropriate love songs that could've been chosen instead of \\"Kiss\\" and \\"I'll Make Love To You\\". An original score would've been better. As for the so-called \\"PETA-like progaganda\\", there's nothing wrong with caring about the environement.  As a note of caution, there are some scenes that could be frightening to younger children. There's the scene when Mumbles was being chased by a leopard seal and another scene where Mumbles and his crew were attacked  by Orca whales. When Lovelace, some kind of penguin guru, had problems breathing due to a plastic 6-pack pop ring around his neck choking, that was painful to watch.  Overall, \\"Happy Feet\\" was a great movie.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|The look of this movie (and The Ghost Rider)was excellent.  Nic, Eva, and Peter Fonda were great.  I was glad to see Sam Elliott.  I could listen to him talk forever, I love his voice.  Anyway I'll buy this on DVD.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|i've been listening to this album (and hypnotize) since they came out, and am convinced they are one of the best bands out there. there are some people that only like their first two albums, and don't like these. fair enough, everyone has different tastes. to the people who don't like the political content, you shouldn't be writing a review, because you probably don't understand it. there isn't a whole lot of great music out there right now, but if you like awesome harmonies and good hard rock, get this. if not, don't. what do i care?
B000683VI4|4.0|OK, so this one is aiming squarely at the \\"tearjerker\\" crowd, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A disclaimer though, while writing this review, I have hidden my laminated man card in our personal safe and locked it and hidden the key.  I have had a few punches taken out of the said 'man card' and if witnessed writing a review on the \\"notebook,\\" giving it four stars, no doubt the man card police would show up at the door while writing, with the hole punch in hand and demand forfeiture of said man card.  Don't worry!  I think I'm safe.<br /><br />Now back to Nick Cassavete's \\"The Notebook.\\"  The plot line is acted well enough by some engaging newcomer actors, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, as the young couple Noah and Allison who fall deeply and madly in love one summer and are split apart by families, distance, socio-economic castes, etcetera.  Much zaniness ensues and in the end what do you know...it becomes a movie about love and of all things aging.  Gosling is kind of like a cross between Matthew McConaughey circa \\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 days,\\" and Brad Pitt in \\"Legends of a Fall.\\"  McAdams is Mc-beautiful, charming, engaging, and laughs quite well.  Yep...I've fallen in love but so does Noah and that is what the story of \\"The Notebook,\\" is all about my friends.<br /><br />So, the flick sometimes borderlines on the edge of cheesiness and over-sentimentality but if one loosens up slightly I think girls and a few guys out there will enjoy it.  Grant it, you aren't going to be inviting your friends over with a case of bud light to watch it for guy's night but hey...try it out on Valentine's Day or an anniversary with your significant or insignificant other and wallah...the movie works some magic.<br /><br />What elevated this one to four stars is that Cassavete's has a way with the camera.  There really is some beautiful cinematography in \\"The Notebook.\\"  It's appealing to the eye.

B00005JKC3|3.0|First I have to say of the bat I collected the Incredible HULK comics as a kid, and am indeed a fan. A real disapointment was the fact that this is a 2 disc edition and yet has NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!  There is quite a bit of technical jargon that begs for subtitles, so I ask WHY 2 discs and no English subtitles?  Another fact remains, that, at least for me, it felt like there was a fully animated character running around a live action set.  Sort of like \\"Who Framed Roger Rabit\\", without the humour. You really had to suspend disbelief. I especially liked the comic style editing, pure genius although a bit overused. .  I also had a hard time with the origin alteration.  No Bruce Banner throwing mindless hot rodder Rick Jones into a safety trench before the atomic blast, etc.  BACK TO THE MOVIE...It took me about three viewings of the movie for it to finally settle in, and I must say this is a highly ambitious and likable film.  Yes, it has it's faults and does ask a lot of demands of the audience, but having said that, it's a film that grows richer with repeated viewings, and as a true fan of the comic, I must say it's a MUST SEE for any true HULK fan. Let's hope, if a sequel is forthcoming, they correct the lugubrious tone and make it more fun for the audience. For the viewer, a movie shouldn't be work, it should be fun. It's time to put the INCREDIBLE back into THE HULK.  Let's hope fans get another chance to see one of Marvel comics, most enduring tragic characters, get the movie he truly deserves.
B000002UJQ|5.0|\\"OK Computer\\" is best compared to an opera with overdramatic embellishings of loud electric guitars, robotic sounds effects and alienation.<br /><br />It's almost too much to take in at once, but Radiohead holds it all together in \\"OK Computer,\\" mixing classical music theatrics with hard rock.<br /><br />I'm always a little hesitant to say that Radiohead is the best rock band in the world. Thom Yorke is brilliant at coming up with evil songs about dystopian universes. But even I have to wonder what on earth he was thinking in the great \\"Paranoia Android,\\" in which he sang, \\"Why don't you remember my name?/Oh, off with his head, man/off with his head man/Why don't you remember my name?/I guess he does.\\"<br /><br />In spite of some of the random nonsense in \\"OK Computer,\\" the band has melded together very well with this album. Jonny Greenwood plays some of the most insane electric guitar solos, grinding and wailing with his riffs, while Phil Selway smashes on the drums.<br /><br />Songs such as \\"Airbag\\" are filled with gorgeous mixing effects, where the guitars are interlaced with violin sounds. Beautiful songs such as \\"Exit Music (for a film)\\" are filled with dark alienating overtones. Yorke sings, \\"Now we are one in everlasting peace/We hope that you choke, that you choke,\\" as if we are all bitter, impoverished people who hate the world.<br /><br />\\"Karma Police\\" is the big hit in this album, with brutal lyrics about policemen who arrest obnoxious girls who talk in math, or buzz like a fridge or a digital radio. By the time Yorke wails in his operatic voice \\"Phew, for a minute there I lost myself,\\" listeners get hit by buzzing feedback loops, deadening piano chords, long echoes of guitars, violin strings and whatever else they decided to have people play in the song.<br /><br />There are times in which I wished he would sing longer about the theme of alienation in this album, just because the atmosphere and the child-like lyrics are so cryptic and compelling. Songs such as \\"Lucky\\" could have gone on longer into the most massive epic theatrical piece that would impress even The Who.<br /><br />But I digress. This is already an excellent album reflecting Radiohead's experiments with blending classical drama with hard rock. And Radiohead would go even further with their themes of intense alienation in albums such as \\"Kid A,\\" \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Hail to the Thief.\\"he most massive epic theatrical piece that would impress even The Who.    But I digress. This is already an excellent album reflecting Radiohead's experiments with blending classical drama with hard rock. And Radiohead would go even further with their themes of intense alienation in albums such as \\"Kid A,\\" \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Hail to the Thief.\\"
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I never got to see this film upon it's initial release, however I felt it's shock waves even at the tender age of 7.  It's the type of film a young lad would sell his entire comic collection to see based on the hype alone.  (Not ulike THE EXORCIST whose hype was still being felt upon this features release.)  I did however develop an irriational fear of going into the water for fear of becoming DEVOURED, and I had, at the time, never even seen the movie!  JAWS works on so many levels, that it apeals to ANYONE who loves movies. \\"Classic\\", \\"Thrilling\\", \\"The First Blockbuster\\", \\"Jaw Dropping\\"; and GENUINELY SCARY, are terms rightfuly aplied to this 5 STAR FILM.  I agree. This movie inspires awe the first time as well as the 20th time viewed. John Williams score is simple and sublime. It's all been said before, perhaps more elequenty than me, But JAWS ROCKS!  P.S. \\"I'll never wear a lifejacket again.\\" Jaws Gets 5 Stars because, it is in fact, a flawless film. P.S.S. If you say the shark looks fake...Think again.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|When John Mayer arrived on the scene, I didn't know what he was about, even when he walked around with Dave Chappelle 2 years ago, I still thought \\"Who is this guy?\\". He's good with a guitar and knows his way around music but who is he.  <br />Fast forward to 2007, after I saw him on Oprah about two months ago, saw his wonderful performance and an even more wonderful interview with him, I was amazed. While others bask in the fame and crave the attention, he doesn't ellude it but he is more appreciative of his gift and he doesn't exploit himself. He doesn't dress up to impress, he dresses in what he deems fit for him and he's very witty. After I saw his performance on the Grammy's and the medley of Gravity, after I sat up and heard the heart felt lyrics, I was more blown away. So here I am, late as hell at getting the album and It's unlike anything I've heard before; it's melancholy but not boring, it's beautiful but not overdone and over-polished, it's direct but not short, it makes it's point without screaming, shouting or being overly dramatic. This is an album you can listen to on a late evening or a rainy day, it plays like a movie and there is absolutely no need to skip songs; you'll miss out.
B00005JPFQ|4.0|When I first saw the previews of Ghost Rider it seemed that it would be a waste of time but as longtime fans of Nicholas Cage my wife and I decided to see the film.  To my surprise, I found Ghost Rider enjoyable and a lot of fun.  I have not read any of the comic books that the film is based upon but the story seems well put together and the performances are fairly good.  Nicholas Cage is a great choice to play Johnny Blaze and Eva Mendes is well cast as Roxanne but the part is one-dimensional and she does little more than react.  Wes Bentley plays a good villain as Blackheart but his role, also, does not have a lot of scope but Ghost Rider is an action film not one for character development.  It was good to see Sam Elliot (as a former Ghost Rider) and Peter Fonda (as Mephistopheles) again in a film.  An excellent performance was turned in by Matt Long as the young Johnny Blaze.      Ghost Rider is an entertaining action film.  As an earlier review pointed out, Ghost Ride is not the comic book but a film based on the comic book so it may not meet everyone's expectations.   The performances may not be the greatest but neither is this a high drama that requires a wide emotional range.  The CGI effects are outstanding, and for Ghost Rider are just as important as the casting.  Ghost Rider is pure entertainment and a ride that I will take again.

0566076896|3.0|Overall Impression of this Book <br /> <br />At 192 pages--47 of these in the appendices--the book is short and a quick and easy read. It does make useful distinctions between small and large sales and the differences in approach that should be used for each. The SPIN method of questioning makes logical sense and is a technique that can be applied to other forms of selling, such as landing a job or selling an idea to a group of coworkers or friends. Overall this book presented a convincing way to be successful in large sales. The one drawback is that the book claims that the SPIN technique is validated by studies of over 35,000 sales calls. The book's presentation of the data is less than convincing and incomplete.  Bar diagrams are too simplistic and do not present significant amounts of underlying data, explanation of collection methods, or statistical measurements.  The skeptic will likely have less confidence in the book as a result, doubting the usefulness of the information.  <br /> <br />Chapter One: Sales Behavior and Sales Success <br /> <br />Selling cycle can be divided into five segments: the opening, investigating needs, giving benefits, objection handling and closing. (The four stages of a sales call are preliminaries, investigating, demonstrating capability and obtaining commitment.) <br /> <br />The author makes a distinction between effective sales methods depending on size of sale, small versus large. <br /> <br />In his research, the opening is perhaps effective in small sales, but not for larger ones. Investigating needs is the most important component of selling, for large sales. For small sales it is much less important. Giving benefits works well once needs are uncovered, but benefits are defined in a very particular way. Objection handling is not important to large sales success, while they may be effective for small sales. Closing techniques can be effective for small accounts, but are counterproductive in large sales. <br /> <br />In summary, for large sales the most important aspects are the uncovering of needs and offering benefits. Everything else tends to take away from sale effectiveness. <br /> <br />In uncovering needs, the author describes four types of questions that will lead the salesmen to an effective sale: situation, problem, implication and need-payoff. These describe the SPIN model, or the sets of questions that lead to sales success. Situation questions are data gathering questions about facts and background. Too many will bore the listener. Problem questions address or explore potential problems, difficulties and dissatisfactions. These lead to implication questions which aim to get the customer to explore possible implications of problems on his operation overall. Need-payoff questions are ones that lead the customer to propose the correct solution himself to the problem at hand and to help him deduce the need for the product that is being sold. <br /> <br />Chapter Two: Obtaining Commitment: Closing the Sale <br /> <br />In this chapter the author says that the traditional emphasis on closing techniques is misplaced. The closing has little correlation to sales success in big sales. Two conclusions are noted: 1. by forcing the customer into a decision, closing techniques speed the sales transaction, and 2. closing techniques may increase the chances of making a sale with low-priced products but with expensive products the opposite is true as the chances of making a sale are reduced. If a client detects that a seller is using closing techniques he becomes much less likely to buy. <br /> <br />An important point is brought up in this chapter, that of furthering the sale. Large sales do not close with one phone call but are instead part of a developing process that will likely take several steps. A failed sales call is one that produces either a no-sale or a continuation, where no new development to further the sale has been brought forth. A measure of a successful sales call or visitis either an order or an advance, something that furthers the sales through a follow-up meeting or some similar commitment from the potential buyer. A good salesperson will always strive to advance the sale. <br /> <br />A successful obtaining commitment strategy is composed of four parts: giving attention to Investigating and Demonstrating capability, checking that key concerns are covered, summarizing the benefits, and proposing a commitment. <br /> <br />Chapter Three: Customer Needs in the Major Sale <br /> <br />The author again makes the distinction between small sales and large ones and explains that needs develop differently for each type of sale. Needs are defined as any statement made by the buyer that expresses a want or concern that can be satisfied by the seller. <br /> <br />There are two different kinds of needs: implied and explicit needs. Implied needs are statements of problems, difficulties and dissatisfactions. Explicit needs are specific customer wants and desires. It is the satisfaction of explicit needs that result in successful sales calls. The purpose of questions in the larger sale is to uncover implied needs and to develop them into explicit needs. <br /> <br />Chapter Four: The SPIN Strategy <br /> <br />This chapter examines how the four SPIN questions--situation, problem, implication, and need-payoff--can be used to help the need-development process. <br /> <br />Situation questions are simple questions to establish facts. Too many of them will bore the buyer. They are not positively related to success, but are often needed to find information. Do not ask unnecessary situation questions. <br /> <br />Problem questions probe for problems, difficulties or dissatisfactions and invite customer to state his implied needs. Sample questions might include: \\"Are you satisfied with your present equipment?\\"; \\"Isn't it difficult to process peak loads with your present system?\\"; \\"Does this old machine give you reliability problems?\\". Experienced salespeople ask a higher proportion of problem questions. Problem questions are effective in small sales but not necessarily in large ones. These questions are asked so as to uncover the customers implied needs. Only when implied needs are converted to need-payoff questions (explicit needs), are sales likely to succeed. <br /> <br />Implication questions serve to probe the nature of the customer's problem and help reveal its true costs and rundown effects. In larger sales, implication questions take a problem that the buyer perceives is small and build it up into a larger problem enough to justify action. Some examples might be uncovering issues of: ease of use, transaction costs, turnover, overtime costs, cost of outside work, and loss of quality.  Implication questions are especially effective in selling to decision makers because they are skilled at seeing underlying effects and consequence. <br /> <br />Need-payoff questions are used to turn implied needs into explicit ones. They typically ask about the value or usefulness of solving a problem. Questions such as \\"Is it important to you to solve this problem?; \\"Why would you find this solution so useful?\\"; \\"Is there any other way this could help you?\\" are good examples. Need-payoff questions achieve two things: they focus the customer's attention on the solution to the problem, and they get the customer to tell you the benefits.  <br /> <br />Need-payoff questions reduce objections in big sales. This is because for big problems, there is usually less scope for a perfect solution and by pointing out how you can solve the problem you may actually bring attention to the imperfect match between your product and the problem. By allowing the customer to make his own deduction, you can get him to tell you which elements of the problem your solution can solve. This approach makes the solution more acceptable and less objectionable.  <br /> <br />Need-payoff questions rehearse the customer for internal selling. Rarely in large sales does one contact make the customer purchase the product. Instead the product is sold internally as employees or decision makers convince other decision makers about the value of the purchase. It is much easier for employees to do this if they have figured out for themselves what benefits the product will bring. <br /> <br />Need-payoff questions are important because they focus attention on solutions, not problems and they make customers tell you the benefits. Need-payoff questions are very powerful in large sales because they increase the acceptability of the solution. Success in large sales depends on internal selling by customers on your behalf and need-payoff questions successfully rehearse the customer in presenting these solutions convincingly to others. <br /> <br />The author suggests preparation as a key tool to successful selling. A sales call should be prepared in advance through writing out possible problem questions and potential implications that may result. <br /> <br />Avoid need-payoff question early in the call as they will put of the customer in the larger sale. An example of this might be starting the call with: \\"Would you be interested in processing your accounts faster?\\" <br /> <br />Avoid asking need-payoff questions when you don't have the answers or possible solutions. <br /> <br />Practice, practice, practice. <br /> <br />Chapter Five: Giving Benefits in Major Sales <br /> <br />This falls under the Demonstrating Capability phase of a sale.  <br /> <br />The author makes a distinction between features, advantages, and benefits. Features are simple facts, data or information about the product. Listing features has a positive effect for small sales success but as the sales size increases, success rates diminish for listing features. This is because as the price tag rises, the customer becomes more acutely aware of the value proposition and features to the extent that they do not provide direct value through immediate benefits are discounted in the mind f the customer. Advantages show how products can be used to help the customer. Benefits show how a product or service will meet the customer's explicit need. Advantages have a positive and slightly positive effect on small sales and large sales, respectively. Benefits have a very positive effect for all sales. <br /> <br />Chapter Six: Preventing Objections <br /> <br />The author writes that preventing objections is all about preventing the underlying symptoms. Instead of selling features and advantages, the salesman should be selling benefits, identifying explicit needs and telling the customer about the best ways that those needs will be met. This allows the customer to more easily see the value of solving his problem. <br /> <br />Chapter Seven: Preliminaries: Opening the Call <br /> <br />In larger sales first impressions are less important than in smaller sales. This is partly because openings are much less important. Traditional sales methodology has focused on openings by teaching that it was important to relate to buyer's personal interests and to make an opening benefit statement. The author's research has shown that neither is important. The framework to a successful call opening is telling the buyer who you are and why you are there and establishing your right to ask questions. The author advises getting down to business quickly, not talking about solutions too soon, and concentrating on asking the SPIN questions. <br /> <br />Chapter Eight: Turning Theory into Practice <br /> <br />In this chapter the author says that the SPIN techniques can be easily learned. Instead of concentrating on quality, focus on quantity. Start by choosing one behavior to work on. Make safe practice calls to smaller accounts. Concentrate on using a lot of the behavior rather than using it well. Trying it at least three times before judging the method's effectiveness.  <br /> <br />Appendix A: Evaluating the SPIN model <br /> <br />This appendix talks aboutsome of the case studies and data gathering the author used in discovering the effectiveness of methods described in the book. <br /> <br />Appendix B: Closing Attitude Scale <br /> <br />A list of 15 statements about how the reader might feel about closing. The 15 questions are scored and an attitude score is developed. A positive attitude to scoring means that the salesman is more suited to small sales success. A negative attitude indicates a salesman might be more successful in big sales as closing techniques are a liability under these circumstances.
B00006AG5N|5.0|How do you make a Greatest Hits album sufficient when the singer has 100s of \\"Greatest\\" to choose from?  Might as well pick 30 #1s and let it be that some will be missing. <br /> <br />The album spans classics still popular today (Heartbreak Hotel, All Shook Up, Devil in Disguise) as well as a few that don't get as much airtime (Wooden Heart, In the Ghetto).  Any fan of the king will be happily entertained, and perhaps singing along for the whole album.  The bonus track of a synthesized-up Little Less Conversation is a treat too, even if it's a stylistic departure from the rest of the album.  The ablum is a great buy for any fan of Elvis. <br /> <br />Long Live the King!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I'd all but given up on Kenny Wayne Sheperd, along with Jonny Lang, another early Blues up and coming favorite, as they migrated to rock music.

Hats off to Kenny Wayne Sheperd and I sure hope this album eventually wins much deserved awards...
B000002KYR|5.0|Eliminator marked the transformation of ZZ Top from a Texas blues band to an international pop phenomenon.  The album - with it's picked up pace and synthesizers - definitely showed a move into the mainstream, but they didn't lose ZZ fans in the process.  Sharp Dressed Man and Legs became Top's two most famous songs, even to this day.  Gimme All Your Lovin', Got Me Under Pressure and TV Dinners add classics that show the range of blues, pop and even comedy.  The depth of the album reads almost like a Greatest Hits album, explaining the album's longevity.  A real classic. <br /> <br />ZZ Top for President!

Jackson really performs all of his songs with integrity and meaning. All of the songs on the concert are beyond amazement. The energy and charisma presented in the concert is unbelievable, to the point where you feel like getting up and jumping just like Jackson and his performers. Anyway its quite a concert and I guarantee you that you WILL be happy with this concert. This is a must buy!! 5 Stars all the way!!.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|This DVD was OK, but not as good as expected; all the hype resulted in a let down.  For such a serious topic, Gore could have come across more serious and far more sincere had he left out that ridiculous first cartoon (really, it was just pathetic ...) as well as the numerous two-bit jokes and political commentary, the latter of which was a distraction from beginning to end.  Seriously, what did half of the poltical commentary have to do with the message he was trying to deliver, other than an attempt to make people feel sorry for him that he didn't win the Presidency ?

B000G759LW|4.0|I got this album last November with the anticipation of listening to Christina's new sound. When I heard her first single \\"Ain'T no Other Man\\", I knew I have to get this album. I totally love her new look...the 1940s old hollywood glamour. And her album stands out from the rest...it sounds very vintage. Very 40s, 50s, and 60s. And that's what I love about Christina. I respect her for that and her current vision. My fav ones are Understand, Still Dirrty, Candyman, Back in The Day, Here To Stay, On Our Way, and of course...Ain't No Other Man. It's such a shame that two songs never went #1. They should be #1. Those songs are awesome! People need to praise her for being unique and creative instead of the people who are not! Christina shouldn't be compared to Britney. They're totally different. Christina has a much more stable, less publicized life than Britney. And these days, it seems like Christina is much more like a lady. Christina is such an inspiration to me. Now, I want to go for the old hollywood glamour look with blonde hair! I, do, however prefer Side 1 much more than Side 2.
0385339682|1.0|I am not a huge fan of Grisham but I have read most of his books. They make good reading when I'm traveling and want an easy read. The Last Juror was a mess of a book even for Grisham. The book began in Grisham style with some soft details about Clayton County , Mississippi. The plot was supposed to center around the rape and murder of a women by a member of a somewhat demented, reclusive family. When the jury begins to consider the boys guilt, the boy threatens to get them when he is released from prison. The boy is found guilty and sentenced to two life sentences. However, as a result of a loophole in Mississippi law at the time, the judge makes the sentences concurrent as opposed to consecutive as the jury had wished. Meanwhile, a young man from up north purchases the local newspaper and sets out to sensationalize the murder as well as other oddities about life in Clayton. The reader doesn't really know whether the newspaper publisher is a crudader or just another money mongering writer (a' la Grisham)looking for a buck. Most of the book meanders around about an elderly black woman who meets for lunch with the publisher for no reasons that are apparent to this reader. When the young boy is parolled from prison (with the Governor's help) two of the jurors are suspiciously killed. The book essentially ends when a wacho tries to blow up a building after firing at some townspeople, the publisher sells the newspaper (his motive to begin with) and everyone lives happily ever after - I guess. If this all sounds like useless and confusing information you have a pretty good handle on what you should expect if you read the book. Shame on John Grisham!!!!
B00005JLH3|5.0|I really loved this movie and even though the cast are all college students, it took me back to my student days at UNC. The marching bands and music are outstanding. Wonderful schools like Clark Atlanta, Bethune-Cook, Morris Brown, and Grambling State do exist and have terrific marching bands on display in the movie. The competition finale blew me away. By the way, Clark Atlanta just won the 2007 Honda Battle of the Bands which is a major competition showcasing 10 top college marching bands. The dvd will be available 5/31 from Honda in high-definition for $14.99 if you need more views of these great bands. Just type in \\"Honda Battle of the Bands\\" to locate their website. The actors are all well cast and Nick Cannon will surely have a great acting career ahead of him. He plays a talented drummer raised by a single mother who never tangled with the law and only cares about music. Problem here for him is his attitude and inability to read music. The scene where he confronts his runaway father after his high school graduation is heart-rendering especially when he tells his father \\"I did all this despite you.\\" He obviously wanted his father to be proud of his accomplishments including earning a full college scholarship. I highly recommend this film! By the way, put on your dancing shoes because the music will make you want to throw down and boogie.
B000003TA4|5.0|Listening to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" the starter to Nirvana's 'Nevermind' will always remind one why the album is such an alternative classic.  Definitive for the fast-forward thrust of their guitars and the primal scream trajectory of Kurt Cobain's blistering vocals, they literally invented alternative as we know it.  Nevertheless, even the most creative endeavors have their influences, and ingredients are mixed and matched for the newest alchemy.  While one can cite John Lennon's 'Plastic Ono Band' as a vocal first and The Replacements as  influences, their blend here is new and masterful.  While \\"grunge\\" may be more of a fashion statement than a sound bite for the C.D., \\"garage band\\" is a more apt description of what they perfected for all.  With a mix of punk and heavy metal, they jump start a whole new genre.<br /><br />Besides the absolutely sublime primal angst of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" there's the propulsive \\"Breed,\\" and the iconoclastic \\"Territorial Pissings\\".  With a mocking intro that starts falsely with \\"Get Together,\\" the latter song does more than separate the generations musically and lyrically.  Then, there's the expert texture of more mid-tempo gems like \\"Lithium,\\" the beautifully acoustical \\"Polly,\\" and the throbbing and multi-layered \\"Drain You\\".  \\"Lounge Act\\" keeps the energy going and drummer, David Grohl, whose gruelling efforts are remarkable all the way, really delivers on \\"Stay Away\\".  The vocal tradeoff between Cobain and bassist, Chris Novoselic proves that you can do alternative and have great voices--that is tuneful and with great trajectory.  If the variations of expert guitar patterns don't disappoint, then the variety certainly scotches any complaints of formula.  \\"Something in the Way,\\" which closes the album, forecasts a more \\"unplugged\\" future, even though the expertise of guitar work hardly needs elaboration.<br /><br />After 'Nevermind' has played endlessly on the radio, it is easy to take their work for granted.  I, for one, didn't even realize that all these songs were Nirvana's.  Which goes to prove that their innovations would make music new again, and it would take some people a while to catch up--not just musicians, but even some listeners.realize that all these songs were Nirvana's.

B00012FXAE|5.0|One of the great action movies out there. Th special edition version (or directors cut) adds in a lot of unnecessary scenes that don't enhance the movie. The extra scenes actually detract from the tight theatrical version.<br /><br />I am amused by the folks who have to compare it to Alien (the first in the series) and declare this one the \\"winner\\". Two very different movies with very different goals. Alien as a horror movie ranks up there as one of the best in the horror genera and is a slow gut wrenching mood setting masterpiece. Aliens is an action packed thriller and also ranks up there as one of the best in its own genera. Holds toe to toe with Cameron's Terminator 1 & 2 (3 being utter waste but that was not Cameron). Two very different movies with very different look&feel. Alien is not to be dismissed. The folks needing to compare the two and declare a \\"winner\\" remind me of the Bugs Life vs Antz crowd some time back who were all emotional and had to hate one or the other. Lighten up folks and enjoy the movies...
B000AO4NJA|5.0|Sam Cooke should be considered like Nat King Cole and Johnny Mathis as an expert of soul and pop.  With an occasional format on oldies' stations, Sam Cooke's legacy deserves a revival for uninitiated audiences.  Remarkably, the production of his songs is clear and smooth, fitting for his voice.   The instrumentation and backing vocals did the soul singer proud.  He could do pop crooner songs with prefection on \\"Only Sixteen,\\" \\"What a Wonderful World,\\" and \\"Cupid\\".  But his festive party numbers could still bring the kids onto the dancefloor, including \\"Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha,\\" and \\"Twistin' the Night Away,\\".  To further his repertoire, \\"Bring It on Home to Me\\" showcases a rockabilly start and a soulful piano for a substantive hidden nugget waiting to be rediscovered.  The engaging lyrics are quick to please, but \\"Chain Gang\\" increases the scope to social commentary.  The three bonus tracks sound like they belonged there in the first place, rather than tiresome encores.  Only one complaint is deserved, with the quality and quantity of great Sam Cooke songs, they don't include \\"Another Saturday Night,\\" one of his greatest songs.  I can only conjecture that there were some copyright disputes, but this omission doesn't stop the album from its high stature.
B000002I7R|4.0|Burning Down One Side is worth the price of this album, all by itself. I first heard it at Hampton Beach, NH when I was in high school and everyone was rocking to it, blasting out of the Camaro ragtops grinding up and down the boulevard. \\"My knees are weak, my head is reelin'\\" indeed. That song is absolutely blistering. Worse than Detroit? No, it;s better than Detroit.
B000AP04EW|4.0|I love this movie. Its got action, sexual tention, and humor all wrapped in one! And this movie, like most, doesn't make the female lead a complete utterly helpless princess who cannot take care of herself. Angelina Jolie is great in her first comedy. And I must admit that I am a bit of a fan of the \\"Brangelina\\", so this movie is also great to see the obvious chemistry they have between each other. The disappointment that I found though, was that in this version of the DVD, the special features are not all that great. It contains some comentary, which all DVD's have and few care about, and some deleted scenes, which are not much. I expected a lot more, and they could have done more. Maybe I need to buy a \\"special edition\\" DVD in order to find the satisfaction that I crave, but I feel that they could have added a gag reel, behind the scenes (especially about the training that Brad and Angelina had to do), and other things like that.  <br /> <br />So what I am trying to say is that buy this version of the DVD because you like the movie. Not because you like the movie and want a lot of awesome bonus features with it.
B000067IZ3|4.0|I still don't understand the love for Crash, the recent film centering on the racism issue. It seemed like a film that had a couple good ideas but they were featured in a bad movie which makes its win for Best Picture all the more confusing. That film for some reason reminded me of Traffic which centers on another important issue; this one being about the drug war and its effects on addicts and non-addicts. While you can obviously tell Traffic is an important film and it is indeed a good one, it's also slightly marred by erratic pacing and a bit of uninteresting characters. <br /> <br />The film, unlike let's say, Magnolia or Short Cuts, is 3 separate storylines with one thing in common: the drug trade. In one story set in Ohio, Robert Wakefield is the newly-appointed \\"drug czar\\" crusading against decreasing the amount of drugs in the country. However, he has a daughter that's quickly starting to get addicted. In San Diego, Helena sees her husband arrested while she's unaware he's a key player in the drug trade with another captured by DEA agents who is going to testify. And finally in Mexico, a highway patrol cop gets involved in the corruption between drug cartels and the want for control of the drugs going in and out of Mexico and the US. <br /> <br />To help the audience differentiate the different places, a color code has been given to each segment. The Wakefield story looks so unbelievably blue that you wouldn't be surprised if character blood looked blue too. San Diego looks more traditional but a bit overexposed making it more brighter while Mexico looks like an indie movie with a very gritty and raw feel and a jittery looking camera. It helps keep track of where you are but like I said, you've never seen skin tones look so blue before; they really overdid it in some cases. <br /> <br />The best storyline is most likely Mexico since it's anchored by Benicio Del Toro who certainly deserved his Oscar. It's also got a more interesting story and a better look toit despite its intentional amateurishness. The one that isn't that great is probably the Wakefield story since it never gripped me all that much. San Diego was alright but nothing to special. Ultimately the problem with the film was that the film just felt slow. Ever watch one of those movies where it feels like you've been watching for longer than the movie is? Not to mention that sometimes one storyline is starting to get interesting then whoosh! off to somewhere else. A similar problem plagued Babel since the Chieko story was ultimately more emotional and gripping than the others. Some will probably disagree and say all stories in Traffic were good but I always groaned slightly when we moved away from Mexico. <br /> <br />It's certainly an ambitious film so not going to argue there and it's a great film at times but I wouldn't say it was my favorite film of 2000.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jones has done it again. If she's not a music legend now, she is quickly becoming one. This CD was produced very well. Even the graphic design of the CD package is worth having just for the creative beauty of it. As on previous albums, she incorporates different sounds (instruments) for the songs, even whistling on one, making for a great variety and distinct feeling for each track. All the lovers of her CD, \\"Come Away With Me,\\" who I find are mostly female, will no doubt appreciate tracks one, twelve, and thirteen. Track two is a fun offering that could be called a \\"drinking song.\\" The \\"plucked\\" and legato cello on number seven will cause you to quickly learn and subsequently hum the melody after listening just once. Also, on the same track are Norah's vocal harmonies that are always comforting. If you're even a small fan of Norah's, you've got to have this CD. The hardcore enthusiasts will not be disappointed. For the female that told me \\"Come Away With Me\\" was a `bubble bath\\" CD, buy another bottle of soap...you're going to need it. (Be sure to get \\"Feels Like Home\\" if you don't have it already.)
B00000K3D4|5.0|David Bowie...Jim Henson...George Lucas <br /> <br />If that's not convincing enough then I don't know what it.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|This film is an example of early-1980s films at their best.  FOOTLOOSE stars a young Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormick, a teenager from Chicago, who relocates to a small, bible thumping town with his mother, when his father walks out on the family.  This is a town where rock and roll and dancing are illegal--a law enforced by the local reverand (John Lithgow).  Ren is determined to challenge this law, and bring dance back to the community.  He gets some help from Willard (Chris Penn) and the reverand's rebellious teenage daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer).<br /><br />Yes, people, this really is an example of when 1980s films (and dance movies, for that matter) go refreshingly right.  Kevin Bacon is simply exhuberant and glowing as Ren.  The best sequences are when we see Kevin cut loose and dance up a storm.  One of the greatest scenes that lingers in my mind (and the minds of many) is when Ren teaches Willard how dance to \\"Let's Hear It For the Boy\\" by Deniece Williams (one of the catchiest and most joyous dance songs from that time).  The cast is great here, and it's really a trip to see the (usually) comedic John Lithgow play straight man, as the buttoned down preacher.  This film truly sucks you in from the opening credits with shots of dancing feet (yes, feet in flashy 1980s pumps, ratty old sneakers and someone wearing leg warmers) and doesn't let go until the final dance number at the end.  A lot of fun.....
0060734191|4.0|I've only read the first book thus far, but I figured I'd better review it now because it might take me a while to finish the series and, honestly, I don't want to look at the review reminder in my e-mail inbox that long.  So... <br /> <br />...This was a well written, tight fantasy.  It has enough depth to make the world of the Old Kingdom believable, yet spares unnecessary details whenever it can.  Nix uses an intesting tool to create a world nearly as well realized as Middle Earth without nine appendicies (props to Tolkien for persistance.  You would shudder at our ADD world my fantasy writing friend...) Anyhow...where...oh yes; Nix creates detail without frills by refering to plot elements and then not explaining them right away.  This sounds like bad writing, but it's not.  One just has to have the patience to realize that eventually we'll figure out what Charter Magic is, and what that rhyme means.  In the meantime, we're given a world where characters and narration flow naturally, without pausing for lengthy explanations.  I like it. <br />As far as the content goes, it's a good story.  As in all things, there's nothing new, but I try not to read books and tell the world where the author stole his plot elements from.  There's nothing new under the sun, every artist is, at their best, a glorified hack.  And Nix does a good job of making the old new again.  I love how his magic is so real, how bells are weapons, death is a swiftly flowing stream and all such things.  I'm interested to see where Nix goes with this series.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|The animation on this movie was so bad.  It's as bad as the Avenger movies.  Terrible animation.  The animation reminds me of Gi-Joe cartoons from the 80's. <br /> <br />The only good animated scenes are the scenes the elementals, but that's not enough to make it worthwhile. <br /> <br />Plus we don't even get to see IronMan in his suit at all the first hour. <br /> <br />The movie is just terrible. <br /> <br />
B000GCFO0S|3.0|This movie is the best recreation of a game.  From the music to the environment.  The people at Konami should use this as an example to what their next gen game should look like.  Now after watching the PS3 trailer I really wanted to purchase this movie despite what others have said about the picture quality.  The movie is far from award worthy but it does really utilize the Blu-ray.  At least as far as picture.  I found the movie looked really good with a crisp picture and superb resolution.  Despite what some people have said I can only think they have less than a 1080p t.v.  Overall the movie is hardly scary and doesn't seem to have anything redeming.  I wanted to have something pull me in.  Whether it was a character's performance on the visuals.  Nothing grabbed me.  Even with some horror movies that aren't very good you still get a little comedy.  Not here.  This may be one of the best videogame adaptations but as far as watchability I would say go somewhere else.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I wasnt sure if 'Awake' could possibly top 'Closer', but I was very wrong!  'Awake' is perhaps Josh's best album to date.  'Dont Give Up' is the stand out track.  'February Song' and 'When She Dances' are sure to be fan favorites.  Dont hasitate and buy this CD!!!
0515141429|3.0|A good novel of action, with the typical scheme of the invincible arrogant hero, Jack Reacher, who brags about beating everyone and everything in the whole world, a road frequently traveled by many mystery writers. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I can qualify as very interesting the scam the bad guys operate related to the racket of counterfeiting money, add much spice to the plot (you can learn something new), it seems that there it has been much research of the author for the make up of these chapters <br /> <br />In the end, I see very polished and neat writing style but very poor character development (for both the good and the evil ones) <br /> <br />In my personal opinion, don't expect from this book, the one of a kind, no matter what the flaps of the both front and back covers recommend <br /> <br />
B000K7UBTI|4.0|Iron Man was one of the classic Marvel Superheroes that didn't get a 1980's make over on TV, like Spiderman, Captain American, Dr Strange, Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D and of course the Hulk (with Bill Bixby)(which in Hulk TV movies had Thor and an early version of Daredevil )<br /><br />Lets say this Iron Man is not the Iron Man you see on the cover of this DVD. That is for future DVD animated releases<br /><br />This is classic Shell Head from the 1960's with the basic grey suit. The origin story changes from Vietnam (as it was in the 1960's comic) to China. However most of the original story line stays the same  in this animated feature<br /><br />This is visually one of the better comic cartoons I have seen, better than the avengers that Marvel did earlier. The voice talent is slightly lacking, but it is better the 1990's cartoon version with the voice of Robert Hayes as Stark/Iron Man<br /><br />On the bonus features, animators and comic artists discuss Iron Man, the DVD is worth that alone for a true comic fanboy. Also as a bonus, the future released Dr Stange is previewed..wetting your whistle for it<br /><br />I hope the powers that be at Marvel animation release an Iron Man 2 before the movie version comes out<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
B000002G0P|5.0|i totally agree that a great track, don't leave me alone,  right after the song 'god isn't dead' doesn't appear on the cd as it was on the cassette. not sure if the earlier releases has the track on. this album is by far one of the greatest rock albums for all time.. for me ... since i am not into rock, heavy metal, and alternative. i guess this album is unique since it has 3 parts and though the first part can be considered noisy, extreme delivered it nicely still lyrically and melodically which captured those who aren't digging this genre.
0060776757|3.0|I LOVE U2.  They're one of my favorite groups and I have many of their albums.  I was hoping this book would tell more about their time in the studio but instead I got 350 pages of Bono talking about how his politics and lyrics are changing the world with occasional commentary from the rest of the band and their manager.  Seriously, 40% of the book is Bono talking about himself.  It appears to have been written by means of 5 guys sitting in a room together with a tape recorder running.  It's still an interesting read and I learned a lot about their past and so forth but it's just too much of Bono talking.

0563486430|5.0|Normally I am not into novels that are TV tieins as so many are off the mark.  As a new fan of Dr. Who, especially of David Tennant and Billie Piper, I have to say The Stone Rose is marvelous.  Jacqueline Rayner has captured the spirit of the new show and of the main characters.   <br /> <br />It is obvious that the author has read enough good time travel fiction in the past to know about the problems with paradoxes and other such situations.  Also how to blend fantasy and myth into being science, though not necessarily hard science.  It is a fun read and I recommend it for all ages.  So impressed am I that I am buying the CD version for car listening when taking grandkids on our next long trip. <br /> <br />Having never cared for the earlier shows, sorry Who fans, I can't vouch how good The Doctor's associates were.  However, even in the novel, Rose Tyler rules.  She is not just a helpless sidekick, she is easily the equal of The Doctor. <br /> <br />I will be gettinng other novelizations and can only hope those authors can measure up to this one.  That can be a problem when more than one person tries to write novels based on a well known show and is why so many Star Trek novelists have failed.
