B009LDD5E0|5.0|If you are a Glee fan than you should definitely get the series on CD. It's not very expensive and not all of the shows are available on Netflix!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I love all the toy story movies and I love that it come with digial copy so now I can watch these great movies anytime I would like!
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|Another great CD by the cast of Glee. I really enjoy the diverse mix of music on this CD. Love it!
B005GSVFB4|5.0|I love the toy story movies and I was sad that they ended them. But all good things must come to an end but I love that it comes with a digital copy!
B00915G6SU|5.0|AS a huge fan of the series, I have made it a point to get all Seasons on DVD- especially since they are not available on Netflix!
B004I654WQ|5.0|I love both cars movies I only wish that these came with digital copy so I can watch all the great artwork and listen to the cool car sounds!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is awesome, can send browser and a few apps to television. Can't wait for them to expand the use.
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael jackson is the best singer and dancer of all time and no matter what anyone says he will stay that way in my heart!!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It alarms everyday. I only have it setup for weekdays It's okay other than what is mention above. Ok ok
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael jackson is the best singer and dancer of all time and no matter what anyone says he will stay that way in my heart!!
B00FEHXISA|2.0|Great character.  Poor plot.  The bright spots are the special effects and the interaction with the child.  The ending is so hokey that it will make you chuckle.  If you're an Iron Man fan, then you have no choice but to watch.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|When I first watched this movie it made me cry on some of the parts but a great family movie to watch with the whole family
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|This is a great Halloween for the family.  Great story line of growing up.  The levels of humor are well layered for the youngest to the oldest.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael jackson is the best singer and dancer of all time and no matter what anyone says he will stay that way in my heart!!
0767903854|4.0|Bill Bryson takes you for a great jaunt through Australia in this book.  His conversational style gets you engaged and keeps you engaged from cover to cover.  I had never had a great want to visit down under until after reading this travelogue.
B004B4RCDE|5.0|when I found out that is was the only way to get my hands on an explicit version of this album them I was gonna get it at any cost!
B002KJX4IE|5.0|My wife and I recently watched Beetlejuice with our teenager who, like most teenagers, rolls his eyes at virtually everything that his parents like.  He loved this movie as much as we did.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Michael jackson is the best singer and dancer of all time and no matter what anyone says he will stay that way in my heart!!
1250038820|5.0|Many said he couldn't do it.  He did.  And he did it fantastically!  Props go to the publisher also for supporting this independent artist!<br />Do yourself a favor and purchase this book, you won't be disappointed!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|In theory this should be a five star review. The device is simple, very easy to use and set up, it has support on a lot of devices and it even supports the Chrome browser as well. The price is also too good to be true. I remove two stars because of Google. Why haven't they opened up this device for other content providers to work with it? I see no reason why every video or audio app couldn't have access to the device. It is very unfortunate that you have to resort to hacks and such tactics to be able to use it more widely. Hopefully Google will see reason and open up their API for all content providers to use.
B00FPH51LQ|2.0|If you like to watch Ryan Reynolds then go for this. Yes, it is funny in parts of the movie. Yes the plot is typical for a movie of this venue. But this is by no means, a great movie. More or less, it's a movie to watch when nothing else is on.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The first half of the book was written especially well, I loved reading Danny's rock bottom moments .  Once Abra was introduced it was cute and worked very well. I gave it four out of five stars because of the lackluster ending with the true knot, there were far more scares that where unexpected and possibly nastier than the shining but not as effective.  My biggest issue was the True Knot clan weren't scary enough and the epic battle could've been much more epic as it was a building up to, but overall highly recommend it, classic King character development at its best.  Abra and Dans relationship were the best parts.
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|It's not Branagh, it can never be Branagh, but if you take it on it's own, without desperately trying to hang on to Branagh's version, then maybe, just maybe you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Anyone who criticizes the story needs to be beaten.  It's Shakespeare.  That's like giving the Grand Canyon a 1 star review because it rained.<br /><br />Acker is terrific.  She makes this movie, forget everything you know about Fred and Dr. Saunders.  She isn't them, she plays a full character that will make you laugh and cry.<br /><br />Denisof is creditable, unfortunately, this is where you can't help but draw Branagh comparisons.  When Branagh challenges you to a dual it's serious, he's not screwing around and he will seriously mess you up.  Somehow I didn't feel that way about Alexis.  Maybe it's a hangup from early Buffy, maybe it's because British guys are somehow scarier, but he just couldn't quite pull it off. (SO wish Branagh had thought of that BEFORE approaching 50% of the Bill & Ted team  - BTW Sean Maher did WAY better than Matrix dude in this role.)<br /><br />The rest of the crew are a good compilation of actors, and if you stop looking for Richard Briers and Brian Blessed for 2 seconds you'll enjoy the show.
B008NQYWC0|5.0|I've been saving the Stand so I can't say officially it's his best, but it will be pretty tough to top this one.  Nearing the end king opens an entire new plain that I wasn't prepared for.  He is on another level in this book.  At the End I was a crying man and no book has ever done that to me.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|A show of how greed and dishonest started long ago.  I love the story line in this series,  Will buy #3 when it comes to Wal-Mart or Target. A lot cheaper people.
B001BANK32|4.0|first time read this and it was great.  Now going to read the sequel.  hope it is just as much a page turner
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids actually like it.  I don't really play it.  They enjoy the minions in general, love the various levels and the graphics.  They do get annoyed when it locks up the Kindle; it does require a lot of system resources.  Otherwise, fun to play.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Great watch for the family. I think my wife enjoyed it as much as the kids did, and kept everyone's attention.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This is a keeper. It gives you a no-BS advice but at the same time, they're easy to read. No frills, no highfalutin words that makes other business books intimidating. Rework examines a workplace far removed from traditional workplaces. Think of this as the future office 3.0, and the philosophy the drives it. Not all may apply to everyone, but definitely there are nuggets of insights that are useful, yes, useful and not just for display.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|COMPLETELY STOLE MY HEART!!<br /><br />Plain and simple - this is one of the best books I have ever read. I wish I could give it 100 stars!! It consumed me. It was a tough story to read, and had me numb at times. Hoover once again delivers a story that is so rich in character development, I was hooked after the first paragraph! I don’t have words to describe either character – but Holder is by far THE BEST BOOK BOYFRIEND IN EXISTENCE.  When Sky is finally allowed to attend school, she meets the mysterious Dean Holder, and the two are drawn together. Holder invokes feelings in Sky that she cannot deny, and their intense connection takes them places they had no idea existed. The message itself is quite deep – “would you rather live a lie that keeps you happy, or know the truth that makes you feel hopeless?”<br /><br />Remember, BOYS are just BETTER in BOOKS!!!!<br /><br />And I’m in love with these fictional characters, Sky and Holder
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Once again the Kindle fire shows why its a waste of money and completely terrible. Terrible appstore terrible everything. Fix it kindle
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Full of surprises, very entertaining, and love the script. Top notch acting rounds this out to be a favorite of mine.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Show to me is just okay. The first season was great but now I feel like they are dragging it out way to much.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Casting streamings other than YouTube faces some difficulty and not smooth. However for Youtube stuff, it is great and so easy.
4898153194|5.0|When I first saw this story online, I ordered the book directly from overseas. It had not hit the American market yet, and I could not wait!<br /><br />The pictures are absolutely beautiful. If you love and feel the human-critter connection, don't hesitate to treat yourself to this magnificent collection of heartwarming images. I cannot say enough good things about this book, and although I could rattle on and on about it, the beauty is beyond words anyways!<br /><br />I'm so thankful that the photographer (the granddaughter) has chronicled this soulful friendship between human and feline. It is truly a gift to treasure. Opening up this book, slowly flipping through the shiny photographs, I am transported into a world of love and caring and equality among beings. My heart fills up.<br /><br />I'm excited to find out that a new book is coming out soon! I will be buying forthwith!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It fun and good tor the kidsi love to play it throw any weather an every one dose u should download it :)
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun with bubbles has great graphics and realistic physics. The game attempts to weave a story into the gameplay with mixed results. However, the gameplay is fun for a straight forward bubble popping physics based game.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I have difficulty connecting my charger to my phone with the Lifeproof case and had to buy an extender that somewhat helps in getting the charger connected.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is another incredible story of \\"The Greatest Generation.\\"  The character exemplified by the subjects of this book is one that was truly OF that generation whether American, British, or German.
B00000IQV7|5.0|My daughter is in Medical School.  I show a clip on Wings Clip and remember how impactful the movie was.  That is why I bought it.  I received the movie a day before I was to visit her.  We watched it together the next night and really enjoyed it.  She said that she share it with the other medical student one evening.<br /><br />The movie made to laugh, cry and think about life.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Excellent movie. Tom hardy gives an explosive performance. And the entire cast is perfect. Loved it from beginning to end.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I fell asleep during the first part of the movie and it seems it wasnt very believable either. My fiance and i were displeased
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Mystery, romance is offered by a good script and casting.  The plot twists and turns so that you can't help rooting for the good guys.
B0086449YA|4.0|Beautiful lyrics,a full- bodied production which allows each string of the guitar to resonate, and a mature, balanced and comforting outlook on life and music. The joy comes through quite strongly.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book in just under two days. I couldn't put it down. I gave it four stars because it was so easy to read and understand what was going on at all times. And sometimes with sci fi stories the plot gets weighed down with all the technical aspects of it. This didn't happen with this book. I liked the turmoil in the children's lives and how they triumphed over everything the adults threw at them. I am going to read all the books in the \\"ender\\" series.  If you like human drama set in a futuristic world, then this is a must-read.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great book really inspires the mind<br />I love the characters or grew to love them on this 10 month read.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Lots of action.  Fun references to earlier movies.  Some acting not so wonderful (looking at you, Admiral!).  A good ride.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|i have never been into superheroes, but i love everything by joss whedon. i LOVED the avengers, and i was so excited when i found out about this show. especially upon learning that jed whedon & maurissa tancharoen are the showrunners (they worked on dr. horrible and dollhouse)! i loved the pilot episode - it was exciting to see ron glass, cobie smulders, and j. august richards again. episode 2 was pretty weak and i feared for the show, but i thought episode 3 redeemed it.<br /><br />this show is classic whedon - it's a mix of genres which will satisfy just about any mood i'm in. and because the dialogue is so good, i can watch the episodes over and over without getting bored, even though i know the plot. that's something i can only do with whedon shows and movies. also, like other whedon shows, it isn't perfect starting out and there's much room for improvement, which only makes me more excited about it because i know it will improve.  all of whedon's shows (except for firefly, which was awesome from the beginning) get much better as they go along and find their footing. i am very happy that ABC has picked this up for an entire season, and i really hope we get at least a second season, because joss plans to become much more involved as soon as he's done with the next avengers movie. with his increased involvement, we are sure to get something amazing, so long as the show stays on the air.<br /><br />i think it's too bad that some people give the show 1 star because of something that has nothing to do with the show, such as not being able to view it on amazon right away, or some other problem with delivery. i also think it's ridiculous to rate the show poorly because it doesn't have enough superheroes. \\"not all heroes are super\\"! other critiques i find more valid. we need some back story on fitzsimmons, because it's hard to relate to them in their insular geek world. i can see them becoming adored though. and the cast, overall, is very young and that strains believability. yes, and they're all unnaturally goegeous. but that's tv. i am willing to suspend disbelief regarding these young, gorgeous agents, because this is whedon! i am so happy that he's doing tv again (he had sworn off it) because anything he touches turns to gold.<br /><br />if i were to add up all my criticisms of this show, i still wouldn't have enough to remove a single star. this is good tv! and most tv is pathetic. i think that j.j. abrams cannot hold a candle to joss whedon, and people will see that as time goes on.ility. yes, and they're all unnaturally goegeous. but that's tv. i am willing to suspend disbelief regarding these young, gorgeous agents, because this is whedon! i am so happy that he's doing tv again (he had sworn off it) because anything he touches turns to gold.<br /><br />if i were to add up all my criticisms of this show, i still wouldn't have enough to remove a single star. this is good tv! and most tv is pathetic. i think that j.j. abrams cannot hold a candle to joss whedon, and people will see that as time goes on.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Intrigueing story jumping between past and present. The reason I only gave it four is because I got a bit confused at times, but my fault-will read again with more attention
1781162646|4.0|It was pretty good but nothing near as good as Doctor Sleep.  That was an excellent book for me to read.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This movie was quite good.  I bought it for the grandkids after we all had watched the rental.  Adults and kids both loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a very thrilling book about katniss and peeta fighting in the hunger games. I'm not giving away too much because it will spoil it for others.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I liked the game, so I gave it a good rating. Would recommend if you like games with clues. Keeps you on your toes...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|From beginning to end, it is a compelling tale.  I could not put it down.  Seals earn their keep that's for sure, so thank you Mark Owen, this is one for the ages.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Loved this move.  I love action packed movies and Densiel  Washington. Would recommend this to anyone that loves action movies.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Hard to put down! Loved the characters! Want to read the next book when it comes out.<br />Hope it is soon!
B00004THAY|4.0|I chose this music because I love both of the artist.  I rated it I only like it because the songs weren't quiet what I thought they would be.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Over all ok is a good place to buy stuff  Have bite stuff is true user good place to buy
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Love the blues and would recommend this music to any one that is a blues fan. Can't seem to get enough of the music.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Love this show always some surprise, or some twists in there. Also love the scenery because its filmed in Hawaii.
031623480X|5.0|What an eye opener and really it all makes sense! I am still in the middle of reading this book
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is sooo cool!!! If you like the movies, download this game right now. It is one of my favorites. You can play with Sid, Manny,Diego, and Crash and Eddie, also Elly. Build your world with their guidance and tips, you'll be a PRO!!!! :) :) :) :O
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a master mind. Let me just start there. I was hesitant to purchase this book at first only because I had others in mind (e.g. The Husband's Secret), but the gist of it left me enthralled so I had to indulge. Not to mention it has earned 5,273 \\"5 star ratings\\" on Amazon alone, including my own, and is #9 (was previously #10) in Amazon's paid sales rank, despite its' release date of over a year ago.<br /><br />Gone Girl was so brilliantly written that I would love to write one of those reviews with a plethora of paragraphs, but I cannot do that without revealing any part of the story. With that said, I for one dislike \\"spoilers\\" and will not succumb to including any. All I can say is Mrs. Flynn does not miss a beat and she does not cease to AMAZE her readers. This was my first time reading one of Gillian Flynn's novels, and I can guarantee that I will be purchasing Sharp Objects and Dark Places. Gone Girl is psychologically thrilling, intriguing readers and making you think, all while blowing you away. As a psychology major, I loved the psychological aspect Gillian's plot creates, and this is one novel I would love to see being made into a movie. Well done Mrs. Flynn, I and many others, applaud you!
B003G4W49C|4.0|For the first two thirds of this book I was not enthralled.  It seemed too manly for me, all battle no spirit.  But I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. In the end there is so much spirit to the book that I wanted to weep. Now I understand why people who have read this book seem to have a secret.  Now I get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun! challenging but not impossible! keep the levels coming! I'm already addicted and I cant wait to play the new ones!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great addition to my electronic selection. When there nothing I want to see on TV I just switch to my Chromecast and pick a movie or an old TV show I can't get on the TV now. Love it.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|this is a nice game but... well, it gets kinda old after awhile. it plays the same levels over and over again, but it does get harder and harder the more characters you get. i mean don't get me wrong its fun for a little bit!!<br /> But what i really like about this game is the song!!.. lol. i love the dumb ways to die song! i just have to keep playing it over and over again. i cant get enough of it. i first heard the song on the video it showed for this app then i decided i should download the song, and then finally i earned the full video of it on the app!<br />so yeah i would recommend this to well... maybe not all ages, its too violent for really young kids &quot;i&quot; would say, but that's just my opinion i guess.<br />-the really good things about this app is that it<br />- doesn't have too much adds invading the game<br />- it has cute characters<br />- never freezes or lags... well maybe once or twice but not a lot.<br />- it has a good a cute song to go with it.<br />the bad things about this game<br />- it gets boring after awhile<br />- plays the same levels over and over again with hardly any new ones.<br />- for kindle fire the plane level you have to blow on the plane but kindle fire users cant do that because be have nothing to blow into so there for you simply can not beat that level<br />- it doesnt lag or freeze alot but it would be nice if it didnt do it right when your about to beat a level. then the app closes and you lose the progress of that level.<br /><br />thats pretty much all of the things! overall i would say this is a four star app, i eliminated a star because of the levels playing over and over again.<br />hope i helped!! ;)
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Lots-of-fun family movie, great story line, glad we bought it, we will watch it again and again. If you are looking for a story that &#34;could be&#34; real, this isn't it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids and I love it. they are eight and four. super fun! love that there are so many games and get lots of new ones
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Still hooked . . . characters to love, characters to hate (really hate!), beautifully presented view of life upstairs and down in this time period.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Best film ever made to simply put it in words. It has everything from a good plot to good music to accompany.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely can't wait for the next season.  I love how Maggie Smith's character (the Dowager Countess) has begun to throw more and more verbal zingers that are priceless!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is an amazing game for people who love or like horses. This game helps you learn how to take of a horse. I love this game because I'm a horse lover and it makes it seem real like you really have a horse. So that is why I rated this game 5 stars.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|Not for the casual fan...or is it?There's plenty of meat and potatoes normal music in the world.We have enough garbage pop driven vocal music in the world.Even if there are no fans for this album,it is not garbage.I'm happy they still don't give a s*** about pleasing Mr Record company guy.Id like to see 10 more artist's in alt or mainstream even dare a fraction of time to steer their music to fraction of this level of experimentation and exploration which is seriously lacking in the music world today.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|the scenery is spectacular, the characters intriguing..have almost finished the books, and will put the hbo series on my xmas list
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Great movie.  If you've seen the prior (Thor, etc) movies and want to keep up, you need to see it.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This game is fun, although after awhile my eyes give out. Of necessity the pictures on my Kindle Fire are smaller than they would be on my PC. But if you like &#34;hidden objects&#34; you'll love the portability of this game, not to mention the game itself is really well done and FUN!!!!
B00D5O7BPU|3.0|They need to put more guns on the game every day some from the first games. They to put cool
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Excellent app. It does the advertised task extremely well The varieties of white noise available should suit most if not all who are looking for a relaxing sound to aid falling asleep.<br /><br />The ability to mix sounds, lengthen loops and create your own sets this app apart from others.
0307271080|4.0|Americanah, by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, is an excellent, eye opening book about the experiences of Africans within America. The fictional plot focuses on the life of Ifemelu, a Nigerian woman. At the beginning of the novel she is dating a young man named Obinze. The couple dreams of living abroad in America or England. Ifemelu's beau decides to stay in their home country to finish college; she travels west to America. Eventually, Obinze tries immigrating to England, but ultimately fails. He returns to Nigeria, marries, and makes a life within his home country.<br /><br />Ifemelu builds a successful life in America. She soon becomes recognized for her writing skills, and her blogs. Ifemelu quickly becomes disillusioned about her new home. She starts a blog, and begins to vent her frustrations about racism and her negative experiences with Americans(especially African Americans and Whites). Sometimes, I wondered if the fictional character Ifemelu reflected  (in some ways) the real life experiences of the author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche's.<br /><br />Although long, this book opened my eyes about African's reflections about immigrating to America.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We had heard suits was a good show but didn't start watching until recently.<br /><br />It's entertaining and fun to watch! I highly recommend it!
B004AQR29C|5.0|I'm thinking Not!!  These guys took &#34;taking on the establishment&#34; to a whole new level.  Very entertaining!  The &#34;old&#34; boys still have it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and i watched three seasons of this series and just wished it would go on and on!  The actors and actresses all deserve to win awards!  Can't wait for the 4 th year to start.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Wow! This one was hard to put down.  Lots going on and just enough suspense to keep my interested without totally confusing me.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|Can't believe it took me so long to watch this.  Loved it!  Great story.  Good twists.  Keeps you interested until the very end.  Wasn't thrilled with the ending; it felt too rushed, but oh well.
B00AHGSVKS|2.0|I read this book only because it was chosen by my book club.  Not the worse book I ever read but it did not convert me to a science fiction fan.  Only the person who chose it really liked it and it is her favorite book of all time.  I will say it made for a lively discussion of the contents and what it says about a society that has all its needs met in exchange for freedom, the role of innovation and art in the world's future.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Why does the android app have to be so different from the apple one.  The apple version is much better.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Wonderful for Kindle HD. I should have gotten this sooner! Easy to use and understand, great for studying or reviewing articles and documents.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|It started out kind of slowly with an awful lot of scene-setting but developed into a pretty interesting tale ala Jane Austin.  By the end of the book PD James had me back among the convoluted goings on of those bygone days, caring for the families' members and their contentedness and glad to see the backside of that scoundrel Wickham.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|We purchased this for our son David for his 25th Birthday. He immediately began assembling it. He loved it and plans to buy other Minecraft Lego sets.
B00536OCYG|5.0|At this point I think anyone interested in this album probably already has it in one form or another.  This product is really all about the packaging and this one doesn't disappoint.  The vinyl is pretty nice on it's own though if you really are buying for the spinning black circle sound.  I don't even own a turntable so all I cared about was the goodies.  The cover looks great on my wall and the liner notes made my Floyd loving wife smile from ear to ear!  This is just so much more of an experience than any CD can offer.  And the music is pretty cool too!
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|The entire album is classic Marc Anthony.  Good to know he can still make music like he did ten years ago!
030788743X|3.0|Several of my friends told me that I just had to read this book.  I'm glad I did as it does spin an interesting enough yarn.  But it isn't one of those books that I'll be returning to ever again.  I read another review that stated this was a young adult level book aimed at thirty to forty somethings.  That was spot on in my opinion.  Like Fifty Shades this book doesn't have the chops to play in the big leagues with real grown up fiction.  There is way too much telling and not nearly enough showing.<br /><br />I don't mean to come across as all negative.  The book does have a cool story arc and the constant homages are entertaining for the intended audience.  This will no doubt make a decent foundation for a movie someday.  But I expect more out of a reading experience and this one didn't leave me guessing much.  The characters are as predictable as they are flat.  The plot is telegraphed early on as well.  This wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem if it wasn't aimed at more experienced readers.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book and I guess I recommend it as a nice water cooler discussion piece if you run in the right circles.  But this book will not challenge an experienced reader.  On the bright side it does go really fast.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow. Ups and downs, never knowing where the story is going. He brutal honesty of what people do and say to protect the ones they love showed in this book.
0385351399|5.0|I had a BLAST with this book! OUTSTANDING KNOCKED-MY-SOCKS-OFF-GREAT!!!!!!!<br /><br />Its a fabulous Satire with a cautionary tale!<br />--\\"Sharing is Caring\\"???<br />--\\"Secrets are lies\\"???<br />--\\"Privacy is theft\\"???<br /><br />In the Jewish Religion -- Education is important. We are taught, \\"Learn in order to teach\\". (pass on knowledge).<br />In \\"The Circle\\" --their was a line which made me think about traditional religion:<br />Here's the line: (taken OUT of context to the 'whole' of the story)<br />\\"I understand that we're obligated, as humans, to share what we see and know. And all knowledge must be democratically accessible.\\"<br />\\"We all have the right to know everything we can. We collectively own accumulated knowledge of the world.\\" [I laughed to myself when I read that line --then said to myself --sounds like being Jewish]....lol<br /><br />Back to This Book: (things to think about)<br />What are the costs for 'staying connected'? What are the costs of sharing? Letting the entire world in on your life? If you've nothing to hide--so what??? hm???<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Circle\\"! THE BEST MODERN SATIRE!!!!!! Its company mission is: \\"Passion & Participation. They advocate 'Collective Knowledge', Collective Sharing' -- TRANSPARENCY. The 'Circlers' (people who work at \\"The Circle), are an inspiration when they Open themselves UP -- willing to share their life to further collective knowledge. They are assets to humankind! ---<br /><br />In the fun of this page-turning novel:<br />You'll discover what a *Tru-You* account is: singular online identity anonymity account. (sound interesting?)---and what the benefits would be.<br /><br />You'll learn about SUPER-DUPER CAMERAS the size of lollipops for only $59.<br />AND.....<br />You'll get to know *Mae Holland* intimately!!!! (The 24 year old 'newbie' to \\"The Circle\\")!<br /><br />To Buy the book:<br />Contact \\"The Circle\\" Company. Its a HOT NEW STORE! (found ---'everywhere')<br /><br />DAVE EGGERS is agenius and must be WAY TOO much FUN!!!!(less)
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Fun book to read.  Fast page turner.  Good for reading at poolside on a beautiful afternoon with a cold beverage in hand
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|Derpy Hooves vinyl figure? What's not to love? Highly recommend for any collector/ derpy lover! I don't know what could go wrong!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Too much describing not necessary for the flow of the book.  Good story but slow with all the describing of the scenery
0316247545|5.0|Great book that summarize all the main and background ponies as well as all the episodes in seasons 1-3. Love the design! Must have for all fans!
B00FEN000S|5.0|movies was awesome great action story line everything was flawless on it del toro does it again great movie loved it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|You can only use it with netflix or google chrome.  Does not work with hbogo, showtime anytime, Hulu, or amazon prime apps.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I loved this book. I am so moved by the relationship between James and Bob.  I was captivated by James\\" story and all that he has achieved.  Our animal companions can teach us so much if we just learn to listen to them. They can enrich our lives in unimaginable ways. Their love is unconditional and non-judgmental. I am eager to read more about James and Bob.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I think you should catch up before watching season 4. But overall I knew it was going to be a good season after 30 days...! Not the typical show and not the fast paced type of episode. But it set the stage for lots of fun to come. The action is great with TWD, but it's the story telling I love. Good show for those with an imagination.
B0010OMXKA|4.0|I love Andrea Bocelli.  I liked his Concert in the Desert better than this one. If you are real fan, buy both. If you want just one....get<br />&#34;Under the Desert Sky&#34;. It's magical.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I started using DevaCurl products on my hair and when I searched curly hair this book came up.  I hated my curly hair growing up because nobody knew how to handle it.  This book changed my outlook on having curly hair.  Now, I feel so lucky to have curly hair.  More importantly, the author educates you on care and styling of your hair.  Now, I rock my botticelli curls!  I highly recommend this book.  Changed my entire look!
B000H0MKOC|5.0|I saw this movie and had to buy it for my son who is in sales and marketing. If you can sell cigarettes knowing they are a health hazard, you can sell anything. Very funny.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Only on for 2 weeks - lost 10 lbs and feel great. In terms of keeping it off....fingers crossed.<br /><br />Anonymous
B001O2QW9G|5.0|it's really similiar to a real turtle in looks and size<br />adn I think animal lovers and espcially turtle lovers will like it a lot<br />very nice for kids too!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have already beat the game. I just created a new player to play again and see if I can beat it with an even better score. Bought game before I even finished the 3rd level out<br />of 100.
0812550706|5.0|while the story had a modest origins it had spawned a hugh saga and finally a movie:)<br />my favorite book - a very intresting stroy about human interaction a coming of age story and our place on the universe
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not a gamer but loved this book, raced to the end of it in a handful of days. A wonderful world, fun characters, and a plot that drives forward. Will also make a great movie.
1616550414|5.0|an  incredible guide to the world of hyrule!<br />filled to the brimm with info sketches interviews and even comic strips!<br />very recommanded!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is an hilarious movie. Great songs, stunts, and skits. It is what you would expect from a college based film, witty and smutty at times but overall very funny. Accamazing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome I luved it so much awesome I don't know what to say but awesome a horses are cool and cool
B00979CS50|5.0|pretty much that covers it.  lots of great grinding tunes as crazy horse and neil get it on for 2 cd's worth of music here.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game.  Needs better instructions and more levels.  Not too difficult to solve.  Didn't take long to complete the game and it left me wanting more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered one for me over in the UK works well with my laptops runni the chrome chromecast extension. I also managed to find the S4 android chromecast app online even through its on the UK google play store and it works like a dream. The latest version of the YouTube and Netflix apps work on my iPad as well so it's all!
0553801473|5.0|Did not disappoint, lived up to all my expectations. Only regret: have to wait for the next book.!!! Well worth the wait
B00DQZQPNM|5.0|This case is exactly what it looks like. It fits snug and covers the kindle perfectly. The case adds a little weight and fits so well that it makes the kindle look even better. Couldn't be more pleased. If you are looking for a good quality case at a decent price this is your best bet.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Been playing for months, logged on today and i have lost everything, for the second time!- my levels experience, collections, chargers, everything. Get it fixed and i will reconsider my review
B007ZXK08C|5.0|What a fantastic novel!<br /><br />A great book has left its mark - I can't shake the characters or storyline even though Ive just finished.<br /><br />I need some more books by Flynn stat!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|OMG..Poor Customer Service<br />No phone numbers to be called for customer support or technical support.<br />Customer support only through email and after after one day.<br />I could not get connected to my TV.<br />And contacted customer support.<br />To and forth emails for 1 month.<br />Finally I had to return the chromecast device back to best buy for store credit.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|Toss up for me on my favorite album, between Master of Puppets and Death Magnetic, I could listen to them both all day long.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This was a hard book to finish.  The first couple of chapters are overwhelming with data, but pushing through gets to great advice for men and women.  Definitely recommend to everyone.  The unconscious biases that women and men have must first been seen to be changed.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I love my dive housing , night and day difference from the other housing. the only thing i do not like is that its hard to get it open
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|I know this book since my childhood, and I purchased the kindle edition for my son to read. Hope he will like it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids can't put this game down. Keeps them quiet for hours. May need to buy another Kindle! Would recommend. To anyone who likes the temple run games.
B001EOOQEC|5.0|Next to Heaven and Hell, this is the best Dio era Black Sabbath CD, and the second best Sabbath disc overall. This definitely is some of Sabbaths finest work, woefully under rated, probably because it came out at the height of the Grunge movement. It is definitely a work that stands the test of time, and sounds as new today as it did 21 years ago!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have two smart tvs. So I'm probably not the ideal customer. This would be much better for someone without a smart TV and I will probably give this to my sister.<br />The Chromecast is easy to set up and does provide a convenient method for pushing web content to your television. I was disappointed by the need to use a power cable, but this is not their fault.<br /><br />I'll give kudos to Google for the idea, but skip this if you already have a smart television. Or go for a Roku, it's much easier to use.
B00138KGCK|5.0|deep, somber, evocative, emotive yet entwined with a light touch of the humor most feel....been a fan for forty years and was glad to find it available here.....was actually trolling and took a chance<br /><br />must be what prospecters feel when they strike paydirt....good for you amazon!!
B00BSZZA3I|3.0|Don't like how the flap that covers the screen doesn't stay covered needs to be longer and have like a magnetic or something
1250038820|5.0|This book really touches on the lives in NY. I absolutely live it!! I will be looking forward to a sequel.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Unless I just haven't taken the time to look much at weather.com, this app is much better.  I love the realtime weather according to my/your exact location.  Very easy to use and understand!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Awesome story . Can't wait to read the next book in the series.  First time I have been surprised in a book
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I like the app. I use it to help my parents with their computer woes. I wish done if the instructions were a little more clear though, specifically internet discovery.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I loved it! Very interesting perspective. Not your typical fiction novel at all as it is a set of stories/recollections from 'survivors'.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I was  glad to hear about Gladwell' s New book. I thoroughly enjoyed all of his books. This book puts an interesting spin on lots of classic stereotypes. A major take away from this book is the idea of perceived legitimacy having a significant effect on whether or not people follow rules or societal norms or laws.  I worry about American society and government falling victim to eroded legitimacy.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This is the best game ever you can play with so many characters<br />Different world so fun I wish I could give this game a 10000000 star so fun
B00EY8AL1M|5.0|The show held up better than I expected.  I enjoyed the show as a kid and still works all these years latter as an adult.
B000002I53|5.0|Just learning to appreciate the music and the master artist Coltrane.  This is a good one to start with because there is a familiar tune beneath the sheer artistry and learn what Coltrane is known for, improvising, stretching, and demonstrating the true range of musical appreciation...its wider than you think.
0763660531|5.0|This book was an experience. It was a moment in time with my son that was pure magic. His face lit up as we turned each page and though there are no words, they are unnecessary here. Instead, my almost 5 year old told me what was happening in this book and guessed at what might happen next. He leaned in. His eyes sparkled. He delighted in this book in a way that will make it one of my favorites forever.<br /><br />The artwork is breathtaking. The concept is brilliant and the story that unfolds in your mind as you turn each page is absolutely a 'journey' worth taking. This is the book you pull out to have a beautiful moment with that special little one in your life and the one you will be telling every one else to buy. Absolutely perfect for a girl or boy and truly one of the most unique books on our family's shelf!
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Love that Head is back with such a great album. Every track is good. Set it and forget on long drives.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Not as good as the first one. It has a very predictable plot no real surprises in the storyline. Won't be buying this one.
B00FDSV4TA|5.0|It's rare that later on in a bands career they can find a replacement singer that fits so well.<br />This is great!!! I  love STP and so glad they are back. Chester is a great fit, my only complaint is that we only get 5 songs. Hope they fix that soon.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I just love this book so much. Everything about these photos and stories just makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Great album from start to finish, but that first track is crazy good. Big Alterbridge fan and they didn't diappoint with this one
B001NHNG64|5.0|This was a great, suspenseful read. I look forward to the next book in the series. Lee Child has written another best seller.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. I play it practically every day and am obsessed with it. It has so many awesome minion outfits and fun game modes.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl was very good, I couldn't put it down, HOWEVER the ending was a little disappointing. I recommend it though.
039916409X|5.0|i have been following margaret lynch's career for about 5 years now.  i have seen her take bigger and bigger steps in her own career.  everytime she steps up, she gets bigger.<br /><br />she is incredibly smart.  she is incredibly generous.  margaret models giving in the best way.  her generosity saved me when i could not afford to purcahse help.  she gives a ton of freemium content.<br /><br />i always notice the workings behind the curtain for some reason.  i have been working with her material on and off and it is brilliant.  truly.  and i have watched how she has grown her own buisness and she is brilliant.  truly.<br /><br />here is a coach who walks (and taps) her talk.  i can recommend her 100%.  i just ordered the book and i am looking forward to it because i hope it will systemize her method so i can work thru the material consistetly.  i will write again after i work thru the book and file my report.<br /><br />for now, i say go for it.  buy her book, check her out on youtube.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|Verry boring one of the most cheesiest shows ever all i is is a crazy guy that fights dumb stuff never watch.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Great album. I have been a huge Korn fan since the 90s and they still keep me wanting more! Rock on!
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|Of course if you poop you can crap but it doesn't mean Morgan Freeman has basketballs that will eat your fishy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun<br />Great sweet lots of fun don't like how you have to rate it to move on.  But all and all sweet
0375869026|4.0|This book is a great read. Especially for middle school aged students. August is an underdog hero who helps teach people life lessons they can carry with them for years to come including; acceptance, kindness, tolerance, courage etc.<br />This book discusses many issues faced by everyday ten year old children. Bullying is addressed in a different fashion. It takes an issue that not many authors have dared to take on. A facial deformity can cause a lot of stress on anyone especially a ten year old boy just trying to make his way in a new fifth grade class.<br />This book is written in a form that not many other books like this have taken. Each part of Wonder is told from a different characters perspective. Everyone from August to his friends, family and even his sister's boyfriend get the chance to share how they feel about Auggie and the situation he is faced with. While every perspective is not necessary for the plot, each perspective adds more dimension to the storyline. Even though August faced many tough situations, he came out on top and the story gives the reader hope for difficult situations.<br />One of the parts of the book that might be seen as a negative is the fact that the book uses craniofacial anomalies to teach a lesson about bullying. This could be seen as offensive for someone who has a craniofacial anomaly. But overall the book was great!
1250038820|5.0|I pre-ordered this book months ago and was so excited when it arrived today. I started paging through it and was captivated, as I always am by the photos and stories that Brandon captures.<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, and I almost forgot to pick my kids up from the bus stop. Totally worth it.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Over the years I have read many books on science and/or history, some good, some not so good.  GG&S ranks a one of the best and, for me, is a true classic.  The author, Jared Diamond, is a first class writer and his text is extremely easy to follow even though he covers some highly complex concepts.  As in his other books, Diamond's style is like taking a class in anthropology or sociology, only with out the mid-term finals.  GG&S was a best seller and winner of many awards for science books; Aventis, Phi Beta Kappa and Pulitzer.  All this attention did not prevent it from being controversial and, to this day, subject to intense debate among his peers in the scientific community.  In GG&S you will read one mans interpretation and conclusions that may, or may not, differ from another writers point of view.  We, as the interested layperson, can only benefit from this sort of exchange.  Published over 15 years ago many of Diamond's conclusions may have changed, even for him, or possibly been overturned but his basic idea is still valid. (This edition includes a 2003 Afterword by Diamond: &#34;G,G,&S Today&#34; that addresses many of these issues) Prior to about 40 thousand years ago all humans were stone-age hunter-gatherers that lived in isolated bands or family groups that probably viewed all strangers with suspicion.  What happened to change that simple beginning into the highly disparate societies that we have today?  How is it that some groups seem to have so many advantages of modern life while others are still living as hunter-gatherers?  But, whatever social system they are living under,  people are basically the same.  Australian Aborigines are just as intelligent and capable of coherent thought as any upper-class European, they only differ in their environmental life style.  Racial differences do not play a part in who are the &#34;haves&#34; and who are the &#34;have-nots&#34;.  So, if race is not a factor, what is?  Concepts like; continental axis orientation, geographical diffusion, domestication potential of plants and animals all help to clarify the issue. The development of agriculture led to a more settled life style and the beginning of complex societies.  Domestication of animals for work or food resulted in exposure to new germs and, in some cases, immunity to certain diseases that were specific to the region of origin.  The list goes on; pottery making, metallurgy, exploitation of maritime resources and trade options.  All these factors, and more, have contributed to who, and when, will be the first to develop the guns, germs, and steel needed for their enterprising ventures into exploration and conquest.  While I had no technical problems with this Kindle edition there are some &#34;publisher omissions&#34; that are unfortunate.  Missing are the photo portraits of people from around the world as well as many of the maps and, lastly, the index.  You would think that a high caliber publisher like W.W. Norton would put a little more effort and care into their e-reader releases.<br /><br />LastRanger
B004HD61KE|5.0|This book kept me wanting to turn the pages just to see what's next. I enjoyed every twist and turn.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|This is one those albums that requires multiple listenings...not because it is &#34;ok&#34;, but for the sheer fact that it grows on you like a monster and doesn't let you go. Dream Theater covers all the spectrums of music but right this time. It's not forced. The aggression is intense, and the &#34;softer/lighter&#34; songs don't go the direction you think they go. There is track 9 that needs massive editing to listen to as a song (20 minutes with about 8 minutes of soundtrack keyboards... Not my cup of joe), but other than that, this is their best effort next to Systematic Chaos, which is my favorite DT cd. I think it needs to be noted that James' vocals are the best he has ever done. The drum work makes the music so aggressive... Mike M brings a different edge to the music. I don't need to say anything else about the rest because I firmly believe these guys came from planet x or something or are witches... Haven't been able to figure which out yet - truly amazing musicians.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing all the way through it. I also love all the people and places described in it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game 24/7 it's amazing my brother and me play it and I always  the holloween version is the best to me yet
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Protects my Kindle Fire, has a strap to keep is closed when not using it, and allows use in any position. Well worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun times...helps me get away from stress.  Fun for all ages from 5 years old to 99 years old.<br /><br />Great times!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Read this in bits and pieces as I had time.pleasant read that held my attention. Lucas kind of send like a pansy, but cared about the other characters. Will definitely continue reading the next book in the series.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|There are no faults to this wonderful book!! A definite must read. I love Mckenzie she made me laugh a lot.. I think I fell in love with Drew!! :)
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I absolutely love this cd!  Just about all the songs are 'sing a long', and the lyrics are easy to learn.  Gotye is very talented, according to his father and friends, and I certainly agree. The hit single, 'Somebody I Used To Know' is a favorite AND 'Walk The Plank'.  THANK YOU GOYTE.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|I was expecting a lot more from this film, with the likes of Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson et al. Some of the individual performances were entertaining, and there are some spectacular scenes, but as a whole, dialog feels rehearsed and the plot is confusing, cheesy and requires a serious suspension of common sense to believe. This film failed to evoke an emotion, unless you can classify \\"slightly annoyed\\" as one.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I'm not very technical but was able to set up this in minutes.  Very easy setup and great layout for easy control.  Me and my wife use this app to monitor our younger kids after school.  It is very useful and has all the bells and whistles.  Would definitely recomend this app to anybody looking for a full featured easy to use ipcamera app.  Also in my opinion it is very worth it to upgrade to the pro version.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|The Show is only getting better with each season.  I can't wait for Season 4 to find out if they can make it better and how the characters find new and exciting paths to follow.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Dagnammit if those aren't some wordy reviews!  Try this on for size.  It's a great listen from beginning to end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is AWESOME it is funny to. This is better than temple run 1&amp;2<br />And temple run OZ. The game is just fun.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Wonderful music and message!  My kids want to watch it over and over. They are 6 and still love it like crazy!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is a fun way to pass time.  Challenging and great entertainment for hours on end.  If you like hidden object games, you'll love this one.  I'm totally addicted.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wasn't to hard but also challenging gets you thinking outside the box looking forward to more levels I actually felt sad when I was complete with the levels given.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing, it consumed me and I finished it in a day and a half. This book makes you think a lot and it really touches the heart. I laughed, cried (a lot), and thought while reading this book. I recommend this book to everyone. This is my favorite book now and I would like to thank John Green. The characters in this book became real people to me and I love all of them. Gus is not real but I miss him dearly. John Green did an amazing job, this story felt real and it is worth far more then it cost. I am twelve and even I know that this is good literature. A fault in our stars has a way of moving you and it really hits home. The fault in our stars also opens you up to how hard it is to have cancer and the struggle. The book really tugged at my heart strings and I truly enjoyed myself. We could not joy with out pain and this book taught me that. Surpassed the 5 star ratings by infinity. The relationship between Augustus and Hazel becomes very bittersweet, if you have yet to read this extraordinary piece then you don't know that Hazel and Gus's word instead of Always (as in always together) is okay and this book is always Okay(:
B009HNDTPO|5.0|If you are a mystery fan, then get this series.....it will keep your attention, you won't be able to turn it off.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It just gets better and better.  Excited and can't wait for Season 4 to be shown here in the states.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|New album is amazing just as you expect from a legendary band like PJ. Two thumbs way up. A must have for any rock and roll fan
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Great fun! A real page turner, slightly predictable in places but suspend criticism & realism and just go with it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought it was even better than the first book, and I can't wait to read the third Hunger Games book.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|its really fun game its is like mario... i lve playing it can seem too walk away from it amazing color pictures
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The story was well written; it was a pleasure to watch as a family. I would recommend watching this movie
B009DCOU9S|4.0|very cool game love two play when i can awsome color pictuers tooo cant seem to stop playing the game
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie. We have a three year old and it was just fine for his age. He enjoyed the movie as well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its awsome love to play it love the color too it is like mario... love too play it very hard to stop playing
1250038820|5.0|I had lost a lot of faith in humanity and was disgusted by the world. It is easy to forget that the people in the news and tabloids are a minority filling up far too much space. Not everyone is stealing money, manipulating the government, cheating on their spouse, committing heinous crimes, blowing people up...etc. Then, I stumbled on HONY and these photos brought me back to reality and helped me remember why I'm so in love with being part of this species. I got the book today and started crying somewhere before the English Bulldog and didn't stop until the end. Online, HONY is wonderful. But the book makes it tangible. My baby has just gotten interested in photos and paintings and sharing this book with her is going to be wonderful.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|it is a great game love too play it ...nice pictures also...  play everyday if can... would tell everyone to try it
030758836X|4.0|Interesting. A different format...enjoyed the characters, the plot and the twists and turns. Impressed with writing, certainly a quick read.
B00E9O6C96|5.0|I have had the Fiio X3 for a few weeks now.  The only issue I have is the 3 second pause between track advancing when the next button is used.<br /><br />USB DAC will be set with the next firmware release and DSD support is on the horizon.  Fiio has great support and a great presence by James on Head FI.  Head to Head FI to get some additional info on the Fiio X3.  More info than I could write in this review.<br /><br />Overall I can't ask for more!
0307592731|1.0|My friends loved this book, but they are hikers/ runners etc. I prefer the comforts of a nice hotel. The entire time I was hot, tired and dirty. Sorry
B00F880BWG|5.0|I was interested to see how things would start out since the show is not following the same story line as the books did. The first episode was pretty much as expected; characters are introduced, an update of where the characters are is introduced, and potential dangers are introduced. Overall, I enjoyed it and am excited about the season. The quality of the HD was good and I am hoping it continues that way since last year I used the standard quality for season 3 and it was pretty unreliable (sometimes granular).
B002Z0TPFE|4.0|There was a lot Excitement and action in the movie. Love the movie. Everybody has to see it once. Great movie.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|Excellent Halloween Classic! Kids love it because it represents the traditional notions of halloween. Bette Midler plays an amazing role.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a delight. The characters were well-developed. The plot was well thought out, and the end of the book surprised me.  I found myself having empathy for all the characters and recognizing how we are all intertwined, and how we are all capable of much good....and much bad.  I liked the book so much I am now reading another of this author's novels.  Do yourself a favor and red this book.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I think I fell in love with this book halfway through the first chapter. I found myself reading it a slowly as possible so it wouldn't end.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory and have purchased all of the previous seasons. I bought the sixth season a few weeks ago and it can within a few days. the packaging was fine as well as the dvds. The show is fantastic so if you're looking for a laugh, buy it!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I enjoyed this mouse since I purchased it. I love how you can adjust the weight of the mouse, it allows for better resistance as you move.<br /><br />One honest thing is that i dont notice the DPI difference from this mouse and my old mouse.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great fun! Easily addictive. You can lose your self in this game for hours! The one thing I would change is the size of the icons. They are rather small.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It is the saddest book I read it made me think how good my life is so thank u to the author for opening my eyes
B00FEC2B7E|5.0|At first I thought this would be great ambient Halloween music. Then it turned into, well, something psychedelic. Always nice to hear something completely different, although it may be a throwback too as it sounds 60 trippyish.
B009X00E18|5.0|Marware cases have my undivided loyalty.<br /><br />Last year, leaving work one afternoon, I inadvertantly left my Kindle Fire on top of my car, and drove seven miles to pick my wife up from her job when I realized my mistake. It took me almost 45 minutes in heavy traffic to get back to my job; as I pulled onto my office's property, I saw my Kindle, lying there in the middle of the Post Road. Fortunately, it was lying, quite literally, in the middle of the road, so no one had run over it. I stopped my car, jumped out, stopped traffic, and was able to retrieve the device. I figured that sliding off the roof of my car at about 20 miles per hour would leave me with a shattered device. However, thanks to the Marware case it was in, my Kindle survived the experience intact and fully functional. Today, that Kindle has been inherited by my wife, as I have upgraded to the Fire HD, but both of our Kindles remain defended by Marware.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I love the movie, always have. I just decided I needed to buy it on dvd. it was well worth it
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I bought Michael's audiobook \\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\" and enjoyed learning all the useful and effective diet and workout information. I love it so much that I also purchased a Kindle version, so I can bring the book with me everywhere I go, especially when I need a quick reference at the Gym.<br /><br />I'm approaching 40, and has always been slim. Because of Michael's book, I'm inspired to transform my body and determined to be in the best shape of my life. I'm doing the One Year Challenge and enjoying it very much.<br /><br />What I find more valuable is the \\"after purchase\\" service that Michael continues to provide on his websites and Facebook. He constantly updates us with informative studies on both diet and exercise. He doesn't need to provide those values, but he does, and I truly appreciate that.<br /><br />I believe what I get out of Michael's book and his regular articles is what I put into it. I feel blessed and happy to come across his book, because it's the perfect motivation that inspires to start eating right and working out consistently.<br /><br />By the way, Michael is a very approachable educator. Ask him any question, and you'll bound to get an answer soon. I feel that he really is passionate about his subjects and really want people to succeed, instead of just selling more products.<br /><br />I hope you'll find his book as motivational and helpful as I do. Good luck and all the best to you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This application is so fun. Finally after so long it is finally available on Amazon, and it is the real deal!<br />Slide your fingers like it's nobody's business, this game is live friends!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|good, it says it is deleting useless stuff.  i do not really understand what it is doing, so i say it is good
0525478817|5.0|I loved it. I mean you invest so much emotion into each character you are almost just as sad that it ends. It's a great book with a great message. I will be reading this again.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|We love our Kinetic sand! I think it's amazing and I couldn't wait to play with it. My 3 year old agrees that it's awesome. He likes to make all kinds of things with it. Volcanoes, castles, pies etc. It's fun to shape and watch it trickle apart. Really mesmerizing. I would NOT buy it on here.    I've seen it go from $40-$50 for 2 lbs of sand!! Go to S&S worldwide and get it for $14.99 for 2.2lbs or $42.99 for 11 LBS OF SAND! Much better deal. FatBrain Toys also has good deals but they're always back-ordered on this sand. Check Retailmenot for coupon codes to get money off of your order. LOVE THIS SAND worth these prices... not this sellers price!! Ridiculous.    10/28/14 UPDATE: The sand holds up wonderfully. It's still a favorite with my now 4 and 1 year old boys. We've added more sand to expand play options. Around the holidays we like to use cookie cutters, among other things! This sand is definitely a must-have if you're looking to change up sand play at your house. Kids are always mesmerized by the texture and move of it. Great product! I know Target now sells this (in regular and colored sand), along with other retailers. Not sure who has the best deal, so it's best to shop around.
014241543X|5.0|I was reading this on the airplane and my little brother turned to me and asked what was wrong, I just sat there sobbing and turning the pages. Once I started it I had to finish it that night. I was so good. I loved the characters and the ending just made you feel such raw emotions.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|[Pros]<br /><br />1. The G13 has eight more keys, which allows me to assign all my hotkeys.<br />2. Its naturally contoured design is very comfortable for the hand to rest.<br />3. The joystick is a lot easier to use compared to the Nostromo. The latter is heavy.<br /><br />[Cons]<br /><br />1. The keys, in general, are a lot more heavier than the Nostromo's. They might be made of different materials, or it's simply a different mechanism. That said, it requires a lot more strength and finger press/movement, which could be exhausting after an hour of gaming. Also, due to this fact, it makes loud noises when you press the keys. I had to turn off my mic when gaming. Otherwise everyone could hear my keypad. The Nostromo doesn't have this problem.<br /><br />2. Even though the G13 has a lot more keys for customization, which sounds exciting in the beginning, a few of the keys actually are not so accessible (for example: G1). After reaching for those keys, it's not so easy to return to the original hand position, which means the chance to press a wrong key is considerably high... Perhaps practice makes perfect, but the Nostromo doesn't demand the extra work.<br /><br />I don't think this is a problem of hand size. I have medium size hands. A friend of mine told me not to get the G13, because he thought it's probably not designed for women, who generally have smaller hands. He had big hands but still found the G13 not so easy to master. I decided to give it a try anyway, since there weren't many options available for MMORPG. In my opinion, the G13 is not \\"too big\\" for anyone. As long as you know how to stretch your fingers and coordinate, it's like playing the piano. So really, it's a problem of design and mechanism. Well, the G13 was invented yesterday, while there is a reason why the piano stands the test of time.<br /><br />3. I wish the G13 would have a scroll wheel like the Nostromo.<br /><br />[Summary]<br /><br />I might switch back to the Nostromo, if I can get used to combo keys and its heavy joystick. Otherwise, practice time it is.
0739365681|3.0|This review is for the guy that's reading the book...he's done a ton of voice work and always annoys me.  He has a habit of getting quiet and then LOUD and then quiet again.  If you are listening in your car and have it turned up so you can hear him during the normal times, suddenly your ears will bleed when he gets loud again...then moments later you can't hear him again.<br /><br />I like the book, though.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I liked this book, but felt that it missed out on being a great book.  There were large sections of the book that just don't add anything to the storyline.  Then as the book is reaching the end it feels like the book needs a few extra chapters to round out the story.  The book ends very quickly which is quite disappointing and dissatisfying.<br /><br />The characters are quite horrible people that you just can't manage to like, but you do end up hoping that they get what is coming to them.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|This movie is definitely poor in quality. Half way through, my husband and I were like, &#34;Really?&#34; We watched the whole thing (because we paid $4 to rent it and we hoped it would get better). We were sorely disappointed. It's like they couldn't figure out how to end it. I gave it two because it was so bad we started reading the 1 star reviews and some were so funny we got some entertainment that evening.
B007REAIUE|5.0|I LOVE the retro sound of the group and the video for Northside Gal is astounding. What a great deal!
B00F880BWG|4.0|Great first episode of season 4! The writers laid the groundwork some new plot directions and kept it suspenseful throughout the episode. Can you ever go back?
6305428042|5.0|Love this movie, a Halloween classic for me, a little hokey, but so great. My first exposure to Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker :)
B003B02O0U|4.0|I am a Grisham fan and this book lives up to every other one. I was caught up almost from the beginning. Don't know why it took me so long to read this Grisham book. The characters are exciting and believeable and the action will not allow you to put this book down or to sleep. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs action like me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had several people tell me how good this show is and I decided to start watching and now I am hooked.<br /><br />Love it!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed this writer's style and definitely plan to read more of her books.  Have already scheduled this one to be my book club choice for our group in 2014, as I know women will all connect & relate to these characters, no matter what age/stage of life they are in now.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|From start to finish, one of the best made movies, story line, everything. I really am dying for the this one.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I first heard Emile Sande sing &#34;Next to me&#34; on the Graham Norton show and she blew me away!  The girl is finally finding her place on the U.S. Music scene and you owe it to yourself to give her a try.  Then you can be the one telling your friends about her, if you don't they will certainly be telling you soon.  The whole collection is great, but be sure to give &#34;Maybe&#34; a listen.  You won't regret it.
B00F36ZHHC|5.0|I found it very complete, very useful information and very advanced. This helps a lot in the research location. congratulations
B009MYARIK|3.0|This one is okay, but not on a par with &#34;Undomesticated Goddess&#34;, &#34;Can You Keep a Secret&#34;or &#34;I've Got Your Number&#34;.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I LOVED that this story had almost nothing to do with a prince charming or a king father or an evil step mother. Disney has finally given us a princess worth rooting for. A princess who is more concerned with controlling her own fate, has no plans to marry and prince charming and a princess whose Mom is a vital part of the story.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|I like having different challenge types, and I like the graphic design of the application overall. I would have liked more of an adventure, with storyline development, but overall a nice traditional hidden object game.
B009NY43NY|1.0|After all the great novels Sookie's breakup with hunky Eric we get this mini story. It is not a real novel it is the answers to what happened and how Claude obtained his bar. How Sookie is invited to a bar party after Eric's memory loss and gets a fake Dracula staked...Please did she really write this shit.<br />I hated it. I was disappointed I wasted my money I spent for it. What a piece of shit really it is the only thing I can think! And yes I call them as I see them. Great sneaky publishing though.<br />You can do much better than this!<br />Joanne
B000SW16M6|4.0|Oldie but a goodie. I haven't watched this movie in years. I remember my mom being in love with Tom Cruise after this movie back in the day.
B00D1VKZ3M|2.0|Okay, Mark Darcy is dead. Yes, I understand Fielding's reasoning behind it and yes, whenever Mark is mentioned, though sparse throughout the book, is nonetheless moving and tugs your heart.<br /><br />But something is just very missing with Mark gone, for all the intervening years of their marriage, didn't Bridget learn anything from Mark at all? So she has returned to the dating scene, now in her early 50s, but she's still as clumsy as ever and acts even more immature than she did in her 30s. The chapters about her fling with the toyboy is ridiculous, all this twittering...texting...vomiting...farting stuff take way too many pages and then, there's this new guy...er...Scott, feels like poor man's Mark Darcy.<br /><br />Helen Fielding has said that Bridget has to be a singleton for the book to continue, that's way she killed off Mark Darcy. I wonder then, if she were to write another Bridget Jones book, would this new guy Scott disappear under mysterious circumstances? Afterall, Bridget had to be single to continue to exist.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome & Addicting!  Has helped me get through many sleepless pregnancy nights!  Not so frustrated I can't sleep now because I have something entertaining to watch!
B002X0CNKA|5.0|This is a very nice jazz album, it would be like something you may hear at coffee shops. Very Chilling!!!
B00B4804KS|5.0|Great Movie with some of the best 3D effects of any movie.. Sound is good as well, A must have for any Blu-Ray collection
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's fun, and keeps my kids entertained. The graphics are pretty smooth and runs good most of the time. I just started the game but don't have any complainants about it. It would have been nice to pick your first horse instead of it chosen for you.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Great album!!  Never get bored of it.  The price made it a sweet deal so I jumped right on it!
0399159347|5.0|This book was recommended by a good friend and it took me a good while to really get into the &#34;meat&#34; of the story line.  It was difficult to keep all the characters &#34;straight in my mind&#34; but I kept at it and really enjoyed the book.  I was somewhat disappointed in the conclusion but once I read the author's epilogue, I realized it couldn't have ended any other way.  The story takes place in Australia and I was amused at how the author wove  so many familiar American anecdotes, etc. into her book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book, very intriguing. I found myself wanting to read it constantly! I am ready to read the next one!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The performances in this movie alone make it worthwhile. To that add heart, a tender script and a large dose of unwashed reality and you have a film well worth seeing. Wonder how this one slipped by.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun. You get to tour all over the world earn coins and collect other things.I suggest that you get this app.
B001BANK32|5.0|No matter how many times you read the Shining you always get a surprise.  Anything by Stephen King is worth a revisit.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I READ ALL OF MS.GREGORYS BOOKS.  HER HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BE COMPARED.  SHE WRITES AS THOUGH SHE KNOWS THE FACTS.
B00127RAJY|5.0|although i have yet to challenge myself to do the full 30 day shred just using these workouts on occasion is killer. Ive only done work out one and two and they both leave me very sore the next day. The 20 mins go by pretty quick and after i learn the routine i usually just put the tv on mute and play my own music.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Pearl Jam are back after 4 years from their last release.  While the last album Backspacer had some mixed reviews, overall consesus was good.  For myself Backspacer was there best since Yield.  Now, when Mind your manners came out I was pretty excited because it had a punk type feel of the Vitalogy years mixed in with Backspacer.  I believe McCready said he was inspired by Dead Kennedy's on the song that he actually wrote music for.  When Sirens single came out, I was amazed again by another quality ballad. Everyone was spot on in Sirens, the lyrics, the melody, the keys, guitar, guitar solo etc... An instant classic.  As far as the album as a whole, it starts off fast with Getaway, reminiscent of Yield type of sound.  Next of course is Mind Your Manners.  Then another rocker in Fathers Son, which has an odd tropical type bridge that takes a bit to get used to.  Sirens comes in too ease the heaviness of the begining.  After that you get a jolt of Lightning Bolt that has another Yield type of sound with a hint of Tom Petty.  Great song.  Next 2 songs are Infallible and Pendelum, which I think are the gems of the album.  Infallible has a funky bass grove and catchy chorus that is instantly epic.  Pendelum has this haunting type of begining that almost sounds like a sonar then takes off with slight simple progressions.  Next is Swallowed Whole which is rocking rhythm guitar with lyrics to match, which honestly reminds me of S/T album and Backspacer.  Next is the bluesy Let the Records Play that has a catchy chorus and McCready wails some blues several times throughout.  Sleeping By Myself is the full bands version of Ed's solo song off Ukelele Songs.  Liked that they added more components to this version.  Yellow Moon almost reminds me of something Ed did off of Into The Wild.  Future Days ends the album off just right with a ballad with simplicity and heart.  Overall, whether you're a PJ veteran or a newbie there is a lot to appreciate with this album.  However, if you're looking for the Pearl Jam of the 90's I don't recommend it to those people because it's not 90's anymore and Pearl Jam have grown up and evolved into something greater.  They've expanded their horizons and never settled for anything less.  I almost gave up on Pearl Jam after Riot Act's passion-less effort.  I'm glad I stayed for the ride.  Lightning Bolt is another Pearl Jam classic and recoommend it for those with an open mind to give it a spin. Lightning Bolt to me is a mix of many things that they have done well in the past and also brought new adventures with it.  The begining reminds me of Vitalogy/Yield/Backspacer then the middle sort of reminds me of Binaural with Infallible and Pendelum.  The end of the album sort of has an Into the Wild/Backspacer/Ukelele songs feel.  Hope my review gave insight to what I consider a pretty good Pearl Jam album that will continue to grow on me.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Fun game makes you think which is always good :) like the challenge trying to play this game I recommend it highly
140006922X|4.0|I learned from other reviews that there are some areas of disputes among scholars that the author apparently glosses over.  I am not a scholar in this area, so, I took it as &#34;note taken&#34;.  I am not religious, but Jesus has had such an overwhelming influence on people world wide that I was interested in his life from a secular viewpoint.  I am interested in history and what makes people tick.  From that standpoint it was enlightening.  It goes into depth about what was happening in the Roman Empire and in the middle east during the period surrounding the life of Jesus, giving a well described account of the politics and milieu that was the soup Jesus and his followers swam in.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great read! An endearing story! At first I thought, &#34;great one of those, ugh!&#34; But once further in it is quite different and now I can't put it down.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|very marginal movie.  the graphics looked stilted.  with such a great story, there is much more that could have been done.
B00005UPNK|1.0|I purchased this DVD thru a company Movie Mars!!  I paid  $ 9.96 including shipping!!  I received DVD I tried playing  DVD !!  I was unable to play DVD , I  WAS TOLD THIS WAS AN UNAUTHORIZED DVD!!  you are not able to play due to fact that this DVD is a REGION 2  and it is unauthorized  DVD  to be able to play in this country!!  I immediately  got in touch with Mars Movie to let them know  and they informed me that I should have known that this purchase was only for Region 2 ???  Not a happy camper , I returned DVD to MOVIE MARS  WITH EXCESSIVE SHIPPING CHARGES IN THE AMOUNT OF 3X THE SHIPPING COST that they shipped it out  for???  I did get in touch with Amazon who told me I am responsible for the purchase!!  Not happy and when I went into reviews with this company I have learned that they have done this to several customers, so I will not deal with this company again, nor will I deal with Amazon  for anything again!!  I hope I get to see this review for anyone else that would deal with this company or Amazon.com!!!!!
B00000FC5H|5.0|For all Earth Wind and Fire fans. A very nice compilation of their greatest hits. Contains all their best known tunes and nicely engineered. Turn it Up !
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Note to self: never read a tear jerker on a plane.<br /><br />What a great heart warming story this is. If it makes just a few people think twice and consider kindness first, what a wonderful tribute that would be!  A quick read that's definitely worthwhile.

B00D82BNLC|5.0|Coast to Coast  Paranormal Investigations: The Journey Underneath is a wonderful look into what could happen during a paranormal investigation. Even though it’s a work of fiction, the author has clearly drawn on vast experience and intricate research to bring this story to life. A creepy tale of malevolent spirits and blossoming romance. A story of how great strength can be found through the people around us and how together we can thwart even the oldest of evils. I hourly enjoyed this story, even the scary parts, and I eagerly look forward to further additions to The Coast to Coast library. Highly recommended and well worth a look.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Decent movie the plot was good the acting could have been a lil better Stallone was better in my opinion
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It totally kept my interest and had a great spin. Fairly easy read, a little spooky at first, I would suggest this to anyone looking for a fun, semi-thriller read!
B00004Z400|5.0|this was my first and only real experience with the deftones, and based upon this one album I reckon they have other songs I would thank myself for seeking out. I never have sought other albums or songs by th deftones, but I have moved 7 times in the last six years and this album always comes with me.
B001BR7CU2|5.0|My brother and I get on a kick sometimes and we sit for hours watching the good old comedies, and this is no exception. Yes its an older comedy, and the tech isn't great, but the movie is, and there is always laughter when this movie plays.

B000I8G5C6|5.0|Anything Will Smith does it great, and this movie is no exception. I don't think I have seen a Will Smith movie I have not liked, he is a very talented actor and does well in any type of roll. I would recommend this to anyone. Great movie.

B0096CDG0O|5.0|Dice with Buddies is fun. It is easy and fun to play. It is almost educational. I would highly recommend it.
0345803493|1.0|I just could not get involved with the characters.  This book just did not grab me. Too much sex for me.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|My husband & I both love watching this and can't wait for the next episode.  Actors are really good and storyline is great.
B00632HWOG|2.0|It works but I wish they would leave it alone. I like things simple and uncluttered. Stop with all the crap I don't want being added -at least give me the option to remove it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Needs screen settings and more 3rd party support, otherwise great device. I also wish the device was more open to moding.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I play it often, and it doesn't get boring. There are a lot of puzzle options even without buying the add-ons.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|great game.  long lasting  different places.  great for young one too.  makes you alert.  :)  fun to play.  keeps going.
B004UID2LC|3.0|But not well enough to write a review about it. It just sits there in the background of my tablet, waiting to be used...

B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|I thought it was going to be easier to use when I got it. The only reason I haven't deleted it yet is because I like laughing with my handwriting skills.
B00EH0K9H8|5.0|I am updating my review. I received my replacement blu ray disc and let me say that although I was disappointed about the technical problems, this band is excellent. These guys really put on a first rate show. Each of their abilities on their given instrument are outstanding. Even though each one is great at what they do, the real stand out for me was Dave Larue. Let me just say wow! So, if you read my old review (below), can't anyone do anything right, even though someone dropped the ball on the technical end of things, this band definitely got the playing part right. I can't wait for the follow up album.<br /><br /> The first problem is the packaging. You almost have to break the disc to get it out of the case. What was wrong with plain old dvd/ blu ray cases. Then after fighting the disk out of the case, the stupid thing won't play.<br />Do these companies just not care? Is there no quality control? It is very frustrating to try and support a band, buy there products and run into these issues.<br />Now it is just another hassle to have to sort out with the seller and have ro wait longer for the product.<br />I am extremely dissapointed!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I enjoy it immensely. Possibilities are just about endless, with enough patience. It's both fun and time consuming. I doubt I'll bore of it any time soon.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This movie is a classic and there is not much else to say. I have always loved it and the easy access just makes it that much better. Great movie. Would reccommend to anyone.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great read can't wait for next book!! Would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who like mythology! The end
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very cool and awesome! love it! it is very creative, imaginative, and challenging at the same time. u should get it!!! five stars for this game!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|HAVEN'T USED IT YET BUT I EXPECT AT LEAST 3-4 STARS. I BOUGHT 3 AND WILL BE GIVING THESE OUT AS GIFTS. I'VE READ ALL ABOUT THE CHROMECAST AND I HOPE IT TURNS OUT AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Spoilers alert!<br />Yes, it is a good book! It is funny (maybe too much talking about farting and vomiting!) and sometimes it made me cry.<br />But I rather it wasn't written! I was happy with the happy ending in the second book! I was happy thinking they lived Happily Ever After!<br />I understand that Mark was such a gentleman, that he wouldn't divorce Bridget and she wouldn't be a single mother! But he was my favorite character in the book and if there wasn't any way of keeping him alive, maybe we didn't need another book!<br />The ending of the book is sweet, though! Well, I guess life is like this! Reality eventually comes before happy endings!
B00EDCIEU4|5.0|This is my second time owning this album. My computer crashed and this was on the top of my list to re buy. Sucky situation but I'm happy to give them my money.

B009LDD1X0|5.0|He packaging was just like I would have bought it in a store. I have bought all 6 seasons off of Amazon and I definitely don't regret it
B001ILFUDC|5.0|A fine example of Disney at its best.  Recommend for all ages.  A valued part of my collection of animated Disney.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|This great movie worth watching... Moving and Powerful.  If only we all could have such an out look on life.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Absolutely a must have for any one with an appreciation for Disney animation.  It doesn't get any better than the original.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great suspense movie!! Tons of action. Loved it. Kept me entertained the whole time. Cant wait for the next one.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|It is a very addicting game, but the music gets annoying after awhile.  All in all it is a lot of fun
B00F35B8F8|4.0|An enjoyable Star Trek movie but in my opinion not a Trekkie purist favorite. I though the characters were a little too embedded in their stereotypes to almost be satirical and cartoonish.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I love mystery and adventure movies. Sherlock is amazing and definitely worth the watch. It has a quick pace and develops each character. I can't wait to watch more!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|our whole family absolutely loves this game ... we can play it for hours ... constant updates and new features make it a great download
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Hope new season will live up to past seasons that we're extremely well written.
B00005O3VC|4.0|It's Monty Python, what else needs to be said, the best of the best in my opinion, you have to have this in your collection
B000EMH9X0|5.0|I have always loved this album. Had it on vinyl when it came out in the 70's. Probably 8 track too.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Great series and good reads, I finally, I thinks got through all of these and enjoyed them from beginning to end.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|Robert McNamara has some interesting life experiences to share, and even though he was in his 80's when this was recorded, he is still sharp as a tack. His anecdotes about the tense times of the Cold War are an interesting look at how decisions are made under pressure with limited information. He also provides perspective on his times as Secretary of Defense, and his roles afterwards. Definitely a good movie for a lazy Saturday afternoon.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun to play, challenging levels. Love the colors and ease of play. Good graphics too. Thanks for the good time.
B0063M22QO|4.0|easy to use. a challenge yet you can progress in the levels.  nice that you can play against the clock once you become more proficient
B000PHVZNE|5.0|I've always wanted to own this movie for my DVD collection so I went ahead and bought it and watched it right away. So good...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy Candy Crush Saga has come to Kindle. I would play it all the time! I was looking for  anew game and BAM! I see it. Thanks Amazon.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|I saw this band one night on Channel 8 and I really like them a lot. So much that I got on Amazon the next day and bought their CD. I'll probably buy their older CDs in the future. It's mellow rock and I like that kind of sound nowadays. Also the songwriting is awesome.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|Everything that makes Star Trek great is in this movie. The Borg, the greatest adversary of all time, and 1st contact with the Vulcans.
B004HYDM0A|5.0|I love Max and Nev; quite the characters and perfect for handling the situations that arise. They really work to help the people involved in the catfishing as opposed to exploiting them. The people put themselves out there for exploitation but Max and Nev do demonstrate compassion and work towards helping these people and their self esteem.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Highly compelling! A great read by any means. You would be cheating yourself to not take a chance on these books at such a fantastic price.
B005PK553C|5.0|The best horror event I've ever seen, bar none.  I loved it!!!  I'm a lifelong fan of the show for sure.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I enjoy sci-fi movies and I thought this movie had a good premise (although a bit of a Matrix ripoff with the growing of clones as tools for the aliens' use).  Tom Cruise was his usual self; you know what you're going to get with him. Morgan Freeman seemed to be tossed in for his name. His role was pretty small. I thought the human opposition forces could have been developed more fully. All-in-all, I enjoyed the movie. Nothing spectacular but better than most movies out there.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Every song has a amazing guitar, drums, and vocals. I love the mix of hard/metal influences in their music. I enjoy Alter Bridge since they first produce One Day Remains, if they keep going down this road. There music well just get better every time. I just wish more rock bands follow your steps. Long live Alter Bridge and their music forever. :D
B0087X728K|5.0|To me this is the best water bottle.  I use it when I'm reading my bicycle.  I but a little bit of ice in the bottle and it last as least two hours.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Dislike presentation I used to love daily mail  used to be best paper now downhill fast  ,  having  gained a bad taste on the way. AGVJAMES

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|If you don't have this game get it that's all I have to say because words can't describe how awesome this game is
B001NHNG64|5.0|I have read 2 of the Jack Reacher books and have found that both are very good.....I like the way Mr. Child's gives the Reacher Character real meaning...it makes you want to have the talent that he has......I hope that it doesn't get to be boring later on in books 3-6
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book,the story line was great.the way they loved each orther! Is the way we all want to be loved.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|lovely read.  Bryson is a great communicator of lfestyle and times, Great good fun I recommend it very very much
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Addictive fun. Just hard enough but not too hard to frustrate. A real winner pretty smooth graphics and enough upgrades to keep up interest PACHINKO feature is a nice touch.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Set in the year 2019, dystopian city of Neo Tokyo - 31 years after the catastrophic disaster that wiped out the entire city - Katsuhiro Ohtomo's seminal film \\"Akira\\" follows the story of a bousouzoku (\\"violent running tribe\\") gang of bikers, including easygoing Shotaro Kaneda and timid Tetsuo Shima. Tetsuo, when severely injured, becomes a guinea pig for a government experiment, developing powers that no one can control.<br /><br />Like Masamune Shirow, Ohtomo's forte as artist does not lie in storytelling, which gets more and more confusing and disjointed as the film's story goes on. Also, some elements are dated in \\"Akira,\\" such as character designs that definitely look 1980-ish. The traditional hand-drawn style of animation may look too old-fashioned to those who are accustomed to watching CG animation.<br /><br />What makes \\"Akira\\" special is its technical aspects like stylish visual designs with meticulously drawn details, as well as sound effects that uses taiko (Japanese drum) sound effectively. There is a good reason that the name of Katsuhiro Otomo is (and probably will be) associated with \\"Akira,\\" even though he has created many works as an illustrator /manga artist and film director. You may not lie the film's violence (echoes of \\"Robocop\\" and \\"Scanners\\"), but you will be impressed with the visuals.<br /><br />It is pretty interesting and even amusing to hear the voices of enthusiastic anime fans living outside Japan, especially when the way they receive a certain work is considerably different from that of Japanese fans. This is the case with Ohtomo's \\"Akira,\\" one of the most influential animation films ever made, to be sure, but is this the greatest animation all the time? Watch it and decide.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very nice and fun game. Cost too much to upgrade though. Great graphics and weapons too. Well done! Keep em coming.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This is fun to play. Like the way you get options for choosing what goes into the room. Would be nicer if there were other rooms to makeover.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this app so much but I'm sick of waiting 1-3 weeks later for the updates to come out. Google plays updates come out quicker than Amazon. But the app itself is awesome and worth the money I'm just hoping the updates will come sooner.
B00CSYRHG6|2.0|The story is half-baked, rushed, predictable and pedestrian. I was really looking forward to this new release. What a waste of $25! A sad disappointment. it compares to &#34;Spirited Away&#34; the way McDonalds compares to Michelin rated restaurant,.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Game gets better as you get further into it. Keeps you thinking constantly. Objects are well hidden making you work to progress
B00CDUVDEC|2.0|Too extreme Phil. I will listen to it a few more times to see if I can grasp it. But, really it's just not very musical.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic she's the ultimate performer to this day...Few performers till this day can do what she did ! There will never be another Diana Ross..... a live tribute to her !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! The colors and simplistic nature is just the beginning before you find yourself working out various ways to get the candy to fall just right. I highly recommend this game for everyone.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have used this on my Kindle Fires for awhile now and think it's a great app.  I like having the battery stats available especially when travelling or beginning a movie.  Information is power......literally.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Every thing is a blast about the game, but wish it didnt cost. Or atleast there should be more to the free version
1480507024|4.0|At last someone exposes the American Empire.  Watch this and you will see how American business interests push policy and create the world we live in today. As a veteran, I am ashamed to know that I risked my life so arms manufacturers can earn more by creating tension with the Soviets.  Same thing today now that the created fear of Communism is now the fear of terrorism spawns all kinds of industries.  CIA - Capitalism's Invisible Army.  How true.  You should watch this and your kids too.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|excellent movie! I loved the music, and the way it went from  black and white to color to show the time period change. Actors were perfect in their respective roles.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|I was looking for a movie for my grandnephew and stumbled across The Croods. Initially I rented the movie, but enjoyed it so much that I bought it. My grandnephew has watched it at least 3 times so far.
0143124544|5.0|It is a fabulous book....insightful, moving, well-written, inspiring...I could go on and on...a must read!! I would recommend it to everyone.
B009VJF128|5.0|great for all ages!  amazing anamation  amazing color  amazing story<br /><br />my 2 yr old and 4 yr old grandsons love this bright and happy story
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|With so many books and series being turned into movies (and not always in the best fashion), I was reasonably skeptical of the Hunger Games Trilogy. After all, when I saw the first Twilight movie, I went ahead and read all the books. Somewhat disappointed by both the books and the movie, it took me some time to get in the mood to read another &#34;movie book.&#34;<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading The Hunger Games! The point-of-view is fantastic. The descriptions are vivid. And there is SO much more in the book than the movie. It's absolutely beautiful and I took the time to read it twice.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone mature enough to handle the concept of a death-match.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this entry in the avengers franchise.  Wasn't overplayed, no one superhero dominated, and the ego play was a core plot element.  Good action, great explosions.  New characters emerge and fit in well (hawk, black widow).  Great villain and layers of villains.  Fun flick.  A lot of violence - not for the under-10 set.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I got this to try the show because, aside from being willing to try any Sci-Fi series that doesn't have a lot of sex in it, the comparisons to X-Files made this a must-see.  And boy, am I glad I got it.  I started watching it by myself, then my aunt started watching them with me, then my whole family became hooked on it.  It's great to have such a wonderful series to share with them.  Here's a graded review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the booklet.<br /><br />1.  Pilot:  No living passengers.  No living crew.  A plane full of skeletal remains sparks an interagency investigation.  A<br /><br />2.  The Same Old Story:  A baby is born - and dies of old age half an hour later.  The bizarre event may be related to one of Olivia and John's unsolved cases.  A<br /><br />3.  The Ghost Network:  A troubled man foresees a bus crash that leaves its victims \\"like mosquitoes trapped in amber.\\"  A<br /><br />4.  The Arrival:  An explosion destroys everything at a New York City construction site - everything except a mysterious cylinder made of solid iridium.  A<br /><br />5. Power Hungry:  A delivery guy is his own power grid, Olivia suffers an emotional shock and Walter takes on some birdbrained assistants.  B+<br /><br />6.  The Cure:  Diner patrons get a surprise when they interact with a disoriented woman; their brains boil inside their skull.  B+<br /><br />7.  In Which We Meet Mr. Jones:  Olivia flies to Frankfurt to confront a scientist who may be the creator of a giant, genetically altered parasite.  B<br /><br />8.  The Equation:  To find clues to the whereabouts of an abducted boy, Walter returns to St. Claire's... and may never get out again.  B+<br /><br />9.  The Dreamscape:  Brief encounters:  Olivia with John, Peter with a woman from his past and a Massive Dynamic analyst with killer butterflies.  A<br /><br />10.  Safe:  Three men rob a bank vault; two escape.  The third is left behind, embedded in the seemingly impenetrable vault wall.  B<br /><br />11.Bound:  Olivia flees her captors only to confront an old foe - and parasitic slugs that kill their human hosts.  B-<br /><br />12.  The No-Brainer:  The team discovers a computer pop-up that liquefies human brains.  B<br /><br />13.  Transformation:  Victims of an airplane crash include a bizarre, spike covered creature with a glass disc implanted in his hand.  A+<br /><br />14.  Ability:  No eyes.  No mouth.  No nose.  Soon after Jones mysteriously escapes his prison cell, a normal man turns into a faceless corpse.  A+<br /><br />15.  Inner Child:  In a tunnel that's been sealed for 70 years, workers discover a feral boy who has a strange, intuitive connection to a killer.  A<br /><br />16.  Unleashed:  In a research lab, animal rights activists free chimps, dogs... and a bio-engineered beast that attacks Charlie.  A+<br /><br />17.  Bad Dreams:  Is Olivia part of the pattern?  Her terrifying dreams about suicide and murder mirror simultaneous, real-life events.  A+<br /><br />18.  Midnight:  On the hunt for a killer with a taste for spinal fluid, the team discovers that the shocking deaths may be related to ZFT terrorists.  A+<br /><br />19.  The Road Not Taken:  What appears to be spontaneous human combustion is investigated.  And Olivia learns more about the mysterious Cortexiphan drug trials.  A-<br /><br />20.  There's More Than One of Everything:  Walter's Gone Missing!  Meanwhile, Olivia tracks down the man who shot Nina Sharp and holds the key to finding the enigmatic William Bell.  A+<br /><br />I must admit that while I prefer X-Files overall, the myth arc here is constantly engaging as opposed to the mixed bag the conspiracy arc in X-Files has been for me.  Here's hoping that season 2 (which I already have, thank God) doesn't disappoint.
0345803450|2.0|Slow, slow, slow.  Some good British cynicism and humor, but I would not have finished it if it wasn't for a book club.  A big disappointment.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Just won the ManBooker prize - youngest author ever - and a New Zealander what's more.  Congratulations Eleanor Catton, The Luminaries is a deeply satisfying read, and so original.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It was my granddaughter's favorite color and it fit perfectly.  The Kindel was easy to slide in and it doesn't fall out.
0385350864|1.0|Gahhhhh, Gahhhhh and more damn Gahhhhhhhhhh<br /><br />Let me preface my thoughts by saying that I'm going to pretend this book was never written, swiftly returning to a sweeter time when I believed that our gentle heroine received the happy ending she deserved from the end of book 2.<br /><br />I would like to start every sentence with 'the very cheek' and 'how dare you' whilst making sweeping arm gestures but I don't want to continually repeat a theme, unlike a certain English Novelist that we all know.<br /><br />Sooo then, let me sum it up quickly by saying - what a contrived, awful, pile of trite!!!!!!!. A complete travesty to the memory of the first two books. I'm almost offended that Helen would think that Bridget fans would enjoy the story/plot. Honestly. What was she thinking; 15 years, since the last book was published,18 years total, of Bridget living in Helen's head and she felt the latest instalment was up to scratch, the best idea she could come up with, that she was doing Bridget's character justice???<br /><br />I pooh pooh you Helen Fielding
B00DKY4LBW|3.0|I love the first song. RU Mine is definitely a hit single. The next 3 tracks are solid. The rest I struggle to comprehend. My favorite album of theirs is &#34;Favourite Worst Nightmare&#34; because you can pretty much let the entire album play without skipping a track. I wish I could say that about this LP but I cannot.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this very descriptive dialog<br />Sheryl has with the readers as she relives her life adventure. So much of the time reading her book I felt I was actually there with her. Was so sad when book ended.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|Pop it in and let it play. In my opinion this is their best album. Fantastic lyrics with an outstanding band providing that Rock quality we all love. I true 5 star album
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|The DR Who series is by far one of the best sci fi series to date. I do collect this series that started in 1963
B008KE3960|5.0|Fun game for free! Requires some strategy. Each game takes a while for the waves to come through but gives plenty of entertainment.
B0073EP7G8|5.0|I have always loved Gilbert O'Sullivan, I have the records somewhere, but somehow had not added him to my collection of CD's and MP3's until now.<br /><br />The music is such a great escape to an earlier time in my life. The Music is as good as I remembered it to be.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I am not a person who often finds joy in reading, in fact throughout my life I have personally read very few books on my own. It was my father who told me, \\"If you read no other books, read this one\\" and so I read it to see what he was talking about. When I first started reading the book, I asked myself why my dad wanted me to read it and I wondered who was Tesla? However, in the beginning I saw a debate on \\"what makes a person genius\\" it answered neither of my questions but alas I was further intrigued to know more. Imagination was brought up and thats when I knew this was a good book for me because I find without imagination my life would be dull and unfulfilling. I pride myself in having an open mind & how could I do that without some sort of imagination involved? Reading further & learning about Tesla's journey made me sad because I saw him fall before I could read it happen, he was ahead of his time & he proposed things the world was too stubborn to recognize quite yet. The world is still quite stubborn. I hear a lot about people who were misunderstood when they were alive only to be understood after they have died. If only things of difference were more accepted. Some say it is human nature to fear the unknown & though I am not certain of this, I have seen it in practice far too many times. I think a needed step in the future would be to broaden how the public views things, not that people shouldn't have opinions but that the stubbornness of people often brings the fall of others while on the trail to greatness. True, as was mentioned in the book, imagination & a passion for something can keep a person going  despite what those around them say but if the people never listen, they never listen. So what do I have to say about the book? More people should read it because it inspires people to be that person ahead of their time.
1250038820|5.0|I saw Mr Stanton on a talk show last week and he showed some of his photos, I was do moved by them I ordered the book immediately, it arrived yesterday and we have gone through the book over six times already. His photography is wonderful and the blurbs about his subjects are so great. Every trip through the book we discovered something missed the previous times. This is something I do not believe I will ever tire of reading.
B004UID2LC|1.0|ok I was going to download this app so I did but then I looked at all the reviews and there terrable I deleted it off my Kendle Fire right off the bat it gives viruses so if you downloaded this stupid app DELETE IT NOW unless you want a virus??? Better listen to me...
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|I saw the old one years back with Sylvester Stallone, that, too, was mediocre at best.  I knew this movie, when released, was not exactly a hit.  But, I was bored, I have Amazon Prime, and it did not cost me anything.  So, for a free movie, it was not a bad way to waste some time when there was NOTHING on tv.<br /><br />The actor that plays Judge Dred, Karl Urban maybe, wears a helmet that covers the top half of his face, after about half the movie, you realize that he &#34;hisses&#34; every word, and that he speaks through his teeth, grimacing, kind of like Clint Eastwood in the old Spaghetti-westerns.  It starts to be kind of funny.<br /><br />At best, I give this two stars.  (Because, in the end, it did not irritate me so bad I stopped watching, and there were some interesting effects and characters, plus the premise is interesting.)  I actually stopped watching it one night, and watched the rest two nights later, so it did not even really keep me interested enough to keep from giving up once and going to bed.  I only finished it out of boredom, morbid curiosity to see if they could pull it out in the end, and out of some insane homage to the old Sylvester Stallone movie that wasted an hour and a half from my youth.<br /><br />Honestly, you get the feeling that it could have been good, maybe at least halfway good, if they had just had a better script or something.  Who knows?<br /><br />So, if you're really bored, have nothing else to do, and have Amazon Prime, then you might waste a bit of time with this movie.  However, if you have any other available options open, explore them.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book was great.  The book compliments many others like it that follow the same way of thinking.  The experiments however placed it in a category by itself!  Thanks!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham never fail to keep you entranced in his novels, and this one is no different. Great read,great final twist
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Every time I tried to open this app, I kept getting prompted to download more data, but every time the download completed, it just restarted
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Great production! Thoroughly enjoyed watching this rendition of Jane Austen's wonderful work in Emma. For the most part the actors and actresses portrayed their parts that made the movie worth worth watching.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an extremely funny entertaining book.  Loved the ending!  Well worth reading.  Would like to see other books by this author.
B0019MQBJW|5.0|Having had the pleasure of attending a live performance and having seen an old production with Margot Fonteyn as the lead, this is an excellent second best and makes for very enjoyable viewing.
0316322407|5.0|Written with the freshness of youth, this tale is inspiring for all of us.  Woven into her families history and the broader history of Pakistan is the disturbing account of how after the earthquake of the early 2000's the Swat Valley came under the sway of an illiterate fanatic, who held the illiterate populace psychologically hostage to his brand of extreme religion, while claiming the earthquake was punishment for prior deviance from strict behavior.  The army reversed much of this, but the man is still at large, and the valley is now not much freer.  Malala's account of her family's steadfast efforts to bring some sanity into the region and her father's commitment to education for the area is a ray of hope and example for all of us.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|I love, love, love this movie. It is truly an iconic film. It's worth watching again if you haven't watched it recently. There is a lot of violence, but it doesn't seem excessive because it is a gangster movie. Worth owning.
0143124544|4.0|Readers will fly through this book, yet the characters and subject matter will stick around for days after. With a wealth of topics and questions to discuss at book club, you will have lots to talk about, just be prepared with a few tissues toward the end of the book.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This book projects an &#34;outsider's&#34; look at the U.S. and it is very enlightening.  It revealed how people are made to feel that they must meet certain expectations even if they should not have to.  I loved the way she would cite colloquial expressions that aren't logical but that we all practice; it was very funny.  The author also took us inside the mind of a  young woman, far from home, trying to adapt to an unknown culture and how her instincts often helped her navigate tricky situations.
0062255657|5.0|Magical.<br /><br />Going home, back to the place you spent your childhood, is always a strange experience, like the memories are alive in front of you, yet so far in the past they don't seem real.  This is the journey of a middle aged man, who goes back to his home town to attend a funeral and finds himself at the site of a strong, yet fuzzy, childhood memory full of terror, wonder, and love.<br /><br />\\"But standing in that hallway, it was all coming back to me.  Memories were waiting at the edges of things, beckoning to me. Had you told me that I was seven again, I might have half-believed you, for a moment.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman ensnared me with The Graveyard Book four years ago, yet I still had not read any of his adult books prior to this one.  The Ocean At The End of The Lane, though, is without category.  To say it's purely an adult book isn't quite right, but it's not a children's book either.  I would say it's for adults who still appreciate a story with a magical element.  The key is to keep an open mind, while paying very close attention to details.<br /><br />I love Neil Gaiman's writing, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a small book with a lot of heart.  I highly recommend it for a car ride, flight, or anywhere you can read it in one sitting without being disturbed...and then read it again.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It really would have shown how his life was as a kid. And how he would have reacted to the challenges thrown at him.
B00B125QRS|5.0|I just finished listening to the whole collection and I am impressed with the sound. These discs sound better than the remasters from several years back. I am certain that this is a different remastering job and it can be verified just by listening to Diver Down which is infamously thin sounding. Diver Down sounds much better here. I never thought I would ever get a version of Diver Down that sounded this good (the bass is actually audible). But, all of the discs sound better than the other remasters in my opinion.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that there is no mention of any remastering. Of course, there is no booklet which is something that would have been nice and something that also would have been worth paying an extra buck or two for. After reading the reviews for this set, I wasn't too excited about it. But, I wanted it for my collection. It's worth it. I am pleasantly surprised with the sound quality.
B00DURGZHW|5.0|Movie is a winner!  Phenomenal acting.  A little slow in the beginning, but overall a great movie. I've watched it three times.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game will bring you fun for hours and hours! It gets more challenging as you progress through the levels.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|Movie was ok.  Kids enjoyed it for the most part but was really disappointed because nothing about the movie was 3D at all.  I don't know if Amazon does not carry the 3D version or what, but I specifically ordered 3D and did not get it.  Because we are were looking forward to a 3D version, it made the movie a little disappointing & perhaps even distracting, as we kept waiting for the 3D to kick in.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I can't wait to see the MST3k version of this \\"movie\\" and you know it's coming (whenever it's brought back).  This is a brilliant comedy on all levels only problem is that it's not a comedy.  Here's the deal:  If you have a sense of humor there are so many things in this piece of excrement sci-fi movie that will make you laugh your giant vulture hawk beast beak off it's just not possible to not see this movie.  Gotta suspend that disbelief because there's a lot of stuff you won't believe in this vehicle for will smith's son that he doesn't want to be in, err I mean \\"movie\\".<br /><br />Let me list them off:<br />Securing a dangerous man eating beast with cloth.<br />A Manta shaped space ship that can travel at lightspeed but can't handle earth's gravity.<br />Lions that climb trees to get to food that can't possibly sustain them.<br />Primitive cave paintings where no humans exist.<br />Zombie dead sister hallucination.<br />Giant beast bred to kill humans by aliens (you'll never see) who can only smell your fear.<br />Advanced human warriors that have mastered space travel but decide not to wear armor to battle said beasts including something that could mask their pheromones; they also don't have prosthetics or robot appendages despite the fact they have a pocket x-ray system and self-surgery capabilities.<br />Will Smith with a really bad accent and looking uninterested.<br />Will Smith's kid with a really bad voice (for a movie, no joke) and looking very disinterested in being in this \\"movie\\".<br />Space seatbelts!<br />Magic adjustable space spears used for killing the alien beasts instead of just having a gun.<br /><br />It's just ridiculous.  Must watch.  This is the most complete mock-masterpiece of B style sci-fi I've ever seen.  No space boobies though.
0060594896|5.0|Everyone can benefit from the tools and thought process in this book. Easy to understand with &#34;real&#34; life moments.<br />Jack is the best!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did like this book, it had an interesting story line of boy meets and marrys girl, marriage gets stale, kidnapping, murder, intrigue...all the good stuff.  BUT, the ending was a disappointing one in my mind which is why I am only giving it 3 stars.
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|I am not a Miley Fan, but after this CD that has changed.  The girl can sing.  She has great talent.  Love the song \\"Wreaking Ball\\".  She just needs to chill out, we get it, your grown up.  I Recommend this CD, even if you are not a fan.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Game is fun.  Almost impossible to win some items.  Run out of credits and coins too fast.  Fun game overall!
0985557834|5.0|This book is very informational, we would highly recommend any of his books! Great projects in the book, every one should buy one
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My grandson just loves this game!! He likes to play as much as possible!! I'm so glad we downloaded it!! Love, love, love it!!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I love a novel where I'm left thinking, &#34;This could be a true story&#34;... this one didn't.  Way too much emphasis on a selfish drunk novelist.  Not sure if the intent of Mr Green was to leave readers hanging as the characters were or if he just didn't know where to go with this plot.  Would a dying child's Wish really be to find out what was the fate of some story characters are? Don't think so.
0375869026|5.0|I read this book in advance on my daughter who is 10. I wasn't sure what to expect but was thoroughly entranced by the story and the development of the characters. Each character has his/her story to tell for the year that the story covers. It is a wonderfully written story of Auggie who is trying to become more independent as he starts attending public junior high school after being homeschooled due to his facial deformity. He tries to fit in and win over friends with humor. However, he finds out that some people are not strong enough to be his friend. He persists in his search for true friends and self-confidence nonetheless. With the support of his family, Auggie develops into a mature and funny young man as he teaches others to dig deep and overcome the challenges of bullies and kids who are willing to \\"go along with the crowd\\". It is an emotional journey that ends on a high note. I highly recommend it for children and adults alike.
B0073COMUW|5.0|My wife wanted a lamp for reading or cross-stitching.  I bought her a floor lamp with an adjustable arm.  I got this lamp for it.  Its super bright.  About 900 lumens and only uses about 10 watts of energy.  Thts just a little more than a night light.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|This show does it as well as any of them do.  If I were to write a full review I'd need the drive to write a 10,000 word essay.  I just wanted it to get the 5 stars it deserves.  Highly recommend it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is the best there is on TV. It gives you something to look forward to during the week.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|At first I really didn't like these type of games but then I gave this one a shot and now I have 3 different ones like this. The minions are so cute and funny.
B001UQ71QY|5.0|Thank you for this Awesome book, that you supplied free of charge! All my favorites in one! Ahhhh! What can a woman's heart say, except for sigh... at the name: Mr. Darcy! I LOVE Pride and Prejudice, and I Love Jane Austen!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|21103 lego is an unique product which i like to collect in my lego collection.<br />it included two minifigures and the back to future car is very nice.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It is simply a must read! What an testimony for all Christians, about the aftermath of events that folows, when we truly life like Christ in Love and Humility like the priest in Les Miserables... How our deeds can change people's lives, and show them the way.... How much good can come from bad, if we could just love the un-loveable!
B006PIXKVW|5.0|This was a great movie! The child actor (Eleanor Bronx) was an excellent actress. I suggest this movie for all little girls to see. The movie reminds us that all little girls are Little Princess' and that self esteem, regardless of age is very important and is the basis for character development.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is so good, its like your taking care of your own horse and its such a good game for young kids in my opinion
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I used to love the 1996 Kate Beckinsale &#34;Emma&#34; but this version has surpassed it by far!  Jonny Lee Miller is the BEST Mr. Knightley.  He's so believable and lovable.  You feel his emotional turmoil.  A most excellent performance by both Miller and Garai (and it's always a pleasure to see Michael Gambon).  I loved it!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Can't put it down<br />Great for people who are board and want a book great book<br /> Wish it was a series
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE pinterest. It's so addicting. I go on at LEAST once a day. The best app I've ever downloaded!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Could not put this book down! Draws the readers attention from the very first page. It's a quick read also, under 400 pages.
B00E0SX118|5.0|My husband and I took our kids to see this movie when it was out in the theaters.  I didn't really want to see it when I saw the previews, but I'm glad I gave it a chance.  It's a cute movie, with lots of funny moments and a sweet storyline.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is super awesome I'm level 100 &amp; something. This game is so addicting that I'm still playing it even after that high of a level. There is always something new!You know what I'm giving to play right NOW!!!!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I loved this series I wish they would continue it to further our knowledge as their line continued  I have found some other movies n shows but not as well done.
B00874T02K|4.0|I just started so far so good. Be back after I complete it . Be I am going to complete it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is truly a wonderful read. Great story, intriguing characters, and an inside look at prison, and the struggles these women face. You get a better understanding of the community that is created inside a prison, and the faults of the system - that does not prepare these women for life outside.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The game is very fun and entertaining lots of stuff to do in the game just like real life like build,hunt,fish farm totally cool
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Love the Die Hard movies but the original is still my favorite and the only one I would rate 5 star.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I loved the story, the characters, the dialog and everything else about this book. I could not put it down and I went immediately into the second of the series after finishing this book.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Geat video and a must see if you liked the earlier series. Quality of the images and special effects are amazing.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Scary that this story may have played over and over on plantations in the United States.I can almost feel the despair the characters experienced.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great show never miss it watching it even if I have to get it somewhere other than cable. Can't wait for the next one.
B001YV502C|5.0|Great movie if your into human rights and just want to watch a good flick apparently based in the future.
0345803485|5.0|It's really good!!!!! Not as hard core as everyone wants to make it out to be!  Truly an amazing piece of work.  Can't wait to read the other books!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love it. It is a good idea for a show. Especially with the flesh eating drug that is out there now.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a good game, get boring after awhile need to change it up a little not just locations otherwise good game keep up good work
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's a good game, plenty of action and you never really feel like you have to wait for anything to get back into the fighting.
B00992CF6W|4.0|LOVE THIS APP BUT, HOWEVER THE BIG UPDATE HASN'T COME YET AND IT ONLY UPDATED ONCE BEFORE.THIS APP IS AWSOME THOUGH.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|They are good and they have a good selection of movies and I love spending money with them ty so much
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game not a lot I can say about it I'm just glad I can play it on my kindle now.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I lost my beloved dog Sally in August and I was scared to read this book, fearing it would be too hard.  My mother in law told me I had to read it and I am so glad she did.  What a precious story about the love between a man and his dog.  So thankful I read this book.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Deer Hunter 2014 is alright. But, it is the most expensive free game I have ever seen. I guess you could just play five minutes a day and not spend extra money. Great game, but should bee really free!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This Knife is one of the better quality knives I have, the only problem is that the handle is very smooth and handling it in rain or moist conditions can be difficult.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|This incredibly compact case fits the Olympus E-PL5 perfectly with the kit 14-42 mm lens and square hood attached.  There is additional room to the side (if you place the camera body perpendicular to the plane of the bag's top lid) to place an additional (pancake) lens, a strap, or the flash.  There's room in the front for relatively flat additional items (SD cards, filters, etc.), and room on each side for at least one spare battery.  In short, this is the ideal case for someone who wants a small case into which he or she doesn't have to squeeze the camera (i.e., it's what the Olympus case supposedly designed for this camera should have been).  Build quality appears good, save for the rubbery zipper pulls, which are easily replaced.
B00EUEWRUI|4.0|Much better mix, the sound is right there like you're on stage. Good set list, everyone in fine form. I was revisiting the first 2 reunion studio sets shortly before this release was announced (good timing) and I think they have aged well on the remasters, although I wasn't overwhelmed initially. Seems to be the case with music I value most, the quality reveals itself over time. These disks add nicely to that time.<br /><br />Blackmore's solo on Space Trucking is one of the strangest I've seen or heard. I love it! I'm not a fan of including \\"Difficult to Cure\\" in a DP set list. The version on Rainbow's \\"Final Vinyl\\" can never be bettered. A live \\"Wasted Sunsets\\" would have been much better. This DP version is good, just doesn't belong, even if abbreviated leading into a Lord keyboard workout.<br /><br />Pending further listens, I might still prefer the Stuttgart set as the best from the Blackmore reunion years (maybe), even if Gillan is not quite up to par on that one, and it's not as energetic, The Morse-era Live at the Olympia '96 is probably, ironically, the best of the modern DP live disks, recommended without the slightest reservation. Made in Japan is still the King overall.<br /><br />The video of this same concert is good, but as a previous reveiwer mentioned, they sometimes cut away during a Blackmore solo to other players. Not as bad as the Denmark 72 concert, but still annoying. At least on that on, Jon Lord got his due. On this one we just see his body movements, no keyboard shots hardly at all. The short tour documentary is fun bun slight.<br /><br />Defintiely worth aquiring if you have anything more than a passing interest in DP, close to essential.
B00987MQRQ|2.0|I loved the concept but wanted more depth, more gore, more horror and more of a real ending.  The artwork is mildly amusing and interesting but the story really could have been filled out more.
B0091WNK8M|1.0|I was hoping this would be an entertaining movie but gave up on it quickly.  Rube Goldberg gate opening sequence was just too stupid.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|My hat is off to the author for this well crafted first volume.  All power to him to maintain this quality in the next two installments.  And, if it has the success that I expect it will garner, let us hope he will be intelligent enough to stop at three and not be tempted to make it 5 or 10 where it will inevitably die.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.... Can't get enough of JL. Just listen to the words, this album is even better than the last.  The more I have to have it!
B00AFEQA5K|2.0|M. McConaughey did not do as great a job as he usually does, ie, Lincoln Lawyer was superb! The story line was not very good.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|absolutely the best language learning tool I've found! 10 years of trying to use books &amp; cassettes &amp; DVDs all with no luck. Two weeks of this app and I've learnedly more than all of that. My friend in Italy now has hope that I'll finally learn the language. AAA+++
B0011ZVTEO|5.0|I highly recommend anyone to give this album a chance and a listen. These songs are performed by legendary artists of amazing music!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching this after it ahd been on the air a while. It is great to see where it all started. Excellent series.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This classic American tale of George Bailey, a selfless and compassionate young man who yearns for travel and adventure but never escapes from the small town where he has grown up, is easily one of the most beloved movies ever made. The great James Stewart plays George Bailey, and I can't think of a better performance by him. He is Everyman embodied -- basically good and decent but also humanly flawed. Even when he finds love in Mary Hatch (Donna Reed, near the beginning of her career but at her very best), George's fundamental unhappiness, which has seethed beneath the surface for most of his life, continues, only to boil over during a crisis to the point where George considers suicide. That's when Providence intervenes -- literally, in the form of Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers, in a perfect performance) an \\"Angel, 2nd Class\\" who has arrived from Heaven to present George with a most unusual gift: the opportunity to see what the world would have been like if he had never been born.<br /><br />I choose to reveal no more. You will have to discover the rest for yourself. Know, however, that this is as good as moviemaking gets. It is Frank Capra directing at the zenith of his powers. It digs very deeply into the human psyche with a vision as affectionate and positive as anything ever portrayed on the screen. And if you do not find yourself weeping unashamedly at the finale -- because, as someone once said, no tears are more intense than those of longing fulfilled -- then you might want to examine your susceptibility to emotion.<br /><br />Stewart and Reed are joined by a superb supporting cast, including Samuel S. Hinds as Bailey's salt-of-the-earth father, Thomas Mitchell as his eccentric uncle Billy, Beulah Bondi as his mother, Ward Bond as Bert the cop, Frank Faylen as Ernie the taxi driver, Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower the druggist, and a young Sheldon Leonard (who became a major TV producer in the 1950s and '60s) as Nick the bartender. There's also Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, \\"the meanest man in town\\" and George's frequent foe and tormentor. As for the minor characters, you'll understand how vividly Capra has painted them during one shot at the very end, where he pans the camera across a large grouping, and you recognize everyone.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So glad you finally got this app for Kindle Fire. Could only play on my Pc, but now I can play more!! Plus send my friends gifts even when I don't play. Happy Happy!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Meticulously researched, finely crafted and incredibly unsettling account of the U.S. nuclear weapons program, with a focus on the early program and deployment.  Although Schlosser focuses particular attention on a single incident involving a nuclear weapon,<br />he segues into many other accounts related to accidents with deployed weapons. The manner in which these weapons--the most destructive ever created--were often handled, left relatively unsecured or otherwise treated in a cavalier manner, is profoundly disturbing. After reading the book, one marvels at just how fortunate we've been that one of these monsters hasn't detonated.<br />There are heroes in the book, and we have them to thank for their unrelenting efforts--incredibly, against much push-back<br />from the military--to move towards securing these weapons and making them fail-safe.<br />At the end of the day, it seems it's just been a matter of dumb luck that there hasn't (as yet) been a full-on nuclear accident.<br />Outstanding investigative journalism and a great read.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this alarm. It works great and is loud enough to wake me up. I would recommend it to anyone.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The show is the funniest show I've seem in a long time, I can watch it more then just once
B001NYPTO4|1.0|It is not the music from the actors in the movie.  Some of the songs are sung by the original composer.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Play a bit per day and you should not have to pay for extras if you want to keep it frugal.
B00ESNE696|5.0|I love the twists and turns of the plots within a plot. Great acting doesn't hurt either! These characters mirror our own wishes, desires and flaws. This is the best season so far for this award winning show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thank you king and amazon! I've been waiting forever for candy drugs to be on kindle, love this game! Thank you thank you....How about Windows phone next??? . Lol
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I didn't want to out to down. The book took me through so many emotions... Can't wait to read the next book..
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|Works well.  Uses Weather Underground.  Able to see weather in multiple different locations.<br /><br />I really like how it has the hourly forecast.<br /><br />Kind of wish you could select where it gets it data from instead of being locked to Weather Underground.<br /><br />It does have a screen where they advertise their other products, but it is their products and it isn't intrusive.
1401938906|4.0|Right so, I'm only on the first experiment, moving onto the second so I may not have enough experience to write a review but I feel that I should say what's already happened so far and I will begin to move onto updating this as my experience grows.<br /><br />I shall say that I have a small attention fan, not a great admission so I try to move past things I find interesting and get to the points of the book, therefore I moved straight to the experiments without reading through half the book which seems to be mostly theory. I read through a few pages of the experimental theory and then went straight onto the meat.<br /><br />So, the experiments are as followed:<br /><br />EXPERIMENT ONE: THE DUDE ABIDES PRINCIPLE: The theory is to prove that there is some kind of force among us. Something that everyone seems to call by a different name whether they call it God, Higher Power or whatever it may be. It's all the same thing. The time frame for this, and every other experiment, is 48 hours.<br /><br />Result: I received an unexpected blessing, which was part of the first experiment. A few weeks ago I cracked my ankle with it healing slowly as the weeks went by. This morning, around 12pm (my experiment finishes at 12:50am tonight.) I noticed my ankle had swelled down back to normal size and that my ankle had cracked back into place. It isn't perfectly healed but it was definitely an unexpected gift and improvement, which I was over joyed about as I'm a tumbler who hasn't been able to for a while. I had expected to have to go to hospital to get it fixed, which I'll be doing anyway, but the fact it cracked back into place, has gone back to normal size and has somewhat increased range in less than two days is amazing.<br /><br />I shall update this as I go along, to prove more effectively that this is real, at least for me. There's no loss in trying the experiments.<br /><br />I honestly feel like this has proven something to me and that I now really understand how to use this force to achieve what I want with the guidelines provided, even after one experiment.
B00466HN72|5.0|Great movie for Easter holidays.  I really enjoyed it and so did the grandbabies.<br /><br />1 2 3 4 5 6
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|This book has a twist that will push you to finish the book right away. She's a really great writer.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I use the various sounds to fall asleep. The only issue I have is that I have had to reset the timer every night. At first i was able to set and forget, not sure if there was an update or a setting I changed. No, I haven't taken the time to check out help or all reviews. Just have to remember to set or it runs all night. The variety of sounds are good. Easy to use.
B000AARKW6|5.0|It works great and it was not damaged or broken. I was very happy with this purchase just great. Thanks.
B007BVMVDU|3.0|steams quick its a good show entertaining be careful watch what episode you are buying I accidently bout the right # episode wrong season.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is heartwarming and uplifting, it left me with a sense of hope and courage. Life is certainly a challenge, it's up to us to make it good or bad.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Its a good show I ordered the wrong episode and wasted my $ but a good show nevertheless thank you
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Godly movie. Powerful! Entertaining and funny. Profound. It leaves you with a lot to meditate about, so many lost values in this evil generation. But there's always hope and strength for those who have Him, Jesus.
B00BEEKN26|5.0|Several weeks have passed and I'm still thinking about this story! The performances are stellar---not a weak link in the whole cast. David Tennant, well, that's all I have to say about that. Olivia Colman, Jodie Whittaker---man oh man! So believable. Just, just buy or rent this. Just do it. Everybody has a story. Everybody.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Very entertaining, I love this genre. What I like the most is the moral principles and humanity in spite of all the chaos and evil that Wolverine has to suffer to survive. And good wins! Of course...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yes yes. have waited and waited; now joy joy. candy crush is in the house! Thank you amazon. we have asked and you have delievered.Love this game will have agreat deal of fun.Very excited; can you tell!!!!!!!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I have bought 3 of these and they are amazing. You can use it to record audio on smart phones, DSLR's and video cameras. I have used this with an iPhone, Samsung Note 2, Flip video camera, Kodak Zi-8 and my Nikon 5100, all with AMAZING audio results. I edit all my videos on my Mac with iMovie. They will take your audio from barely audible, to LOUD and crystal clear! It will make you sound like you are recording in a studio, especially when recording outside where there is a lot of background noise. It will eliminate all that. I own a social media/SEO company and have used this for 100's of videos, my client videos as well as all my own video marketing videos. I HIGHLY recommend this mic.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Read the entire series. My 13 year old daughter loved these books so much that she begged me to read them too. I am loving them! They resemble a Hunger Games survival theme.
B003274QH6|5.0|A must see for sure watched the entire series in two weeks!!  Too bad I had to go to work otherwise we would have seen it all in about a week!! Once you start you won't be able to stop!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|My 13 year old daughter could not stop reading this series of books! These books got her hooked back on loving reading again every night before bed!! Definitely recommend. In fact, the Maze Runner movie is being released in theaters this winter! She can hardly wait.......
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Straight up awesome for anyone  that loves seek&amp;find games! Also enjoy the side puzzles. Only down side(in my opinion) the energy needs to charge a little faster.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|All 4 books are highly recommended by my 13 year old daughter and myself! Very interesting and riveting. If your child or teenager reads these, it will likely get them hooked back on reading daily for pure enjoyment - and off the electronics - for relaxation and enjoyment before falling asleep! In fact, our daughter would hurry up to dress in the morning before school, just so she could have time to sit by the fireplace and read every morning - it was such a treat!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King's characters always find their way into my heart, the good and the evil.  Being in recovery myself made all the AA references especially dear to me.  Gotta love this stuff.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Beautiful music, beautiful story, amazing all around. Gerard Butler is a wonderful added bonus as well. Highly recommended for drama, romance, and musical lovers.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|This is a good movie. Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta were terrific in their roles. Its  basicly about high school kids in their senior year some of whom are in romantic relationships but that's not a big part of the movie. That is mostly what they did that year. You should see this.
0307951529|3.0|Not really a &#34;how to&#34; per se. It's more of a pep talk on how to turn your hobby or interests into a business opportunity. The ideas are helpful but the author doesn't really drill down into the details of how some of the success stories got from &#34;A&#34; to &#34;B&#34; to &#34;C&#34;. The anecdotes are like, they made a website and already had their first order in the morning. There are some helpful materials, like a one page business plan, and stuff you can download from their website, and things to get you thinking. But how did they build a website? How do they pay themselves or do their accounting? That kind of stuff is missing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is finally on Kindle!  Hugely addictive game.  Even when I am stuck on a levels I just can't stop playing.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I DONT LIKE IT AT ALL HATE ME UF U WANT BUT IM A HATER MSP IS IF YOUR STUPID THATS MOVIE STAR PLANET PLZ GET IT
076780421X|5.0|Came quickly , and brand new... love it thank you ! This is a keeper in my video library... even my kids love this movie....
B0089LOG02|5.0|I bought this book for a ridiculously low price, not expecting very much.  Was I ever surprised!  Orphan Train travels between two different periods, yet both of the main characters find their stories closely woven together.  This book is a fast read, and leaves you with a sad, yet thorough understanding of the orphan trains and adoption process of the 1920's...but how going through those horrific experiences can make you a stronger, successful, sympathetic person.
1592332803|5.0|great book.. lots of choices.... i use this book to look for the vegan alternative to my old recipes.. i find one close to my original. i f you are looking for just 1 vegan desert book this is it..
B0055SWM08|5.0|Perhaps a corny play on words but this game is a brain tester of your solving skills and is addictive. I really enjoy this game as it is a good mental workout. This is the best game I have purchased so far. Tutorial is helpful &amp; the music and graphics are excellent. You gotta try it . . . you'll love it!
B001KZG99A|5.0|awesome movie i loved the plot and the characters the acting was great its deff a movie to watch with the fam!!! watch it
B00BATKPBE|5.0|Richard Dawkins is an a wonderful teacher/writer and this book is a great introduction. Start here and keep going. Enjoy.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|i absolutely loved this movie!!! i was at the edge of my seat the whole time!! its a must watch. its suspensful and has a happy ending lol
039916409X|5.0|I was a cynic, I've read every self-help money making book there is but this one really delivers on the promise. Jam-packed with step by step scripts and how-to's, Margaret lets you in on the real secrets that stop us creating (and keeping)wealth. I have already doubled my income this month and have had my mortgage application accepted to buy the house I have had on my wish list for some time.Ifyou follow her detailed advice you will succeed. A gem! Would recommend in a heartbeat.
B000GT1KDG|5.0|Whether your interest is in psychology, philosophy, religious studies, or just understanding people in general, this book is a gem. Frankl speaks about his time in Nazi concentration camps, sharing not only experience, but relating it to his studies of psychology and doctrine of logotherapy. We are struck by the honesty in the stories as we attempt to put ourselves in the place of the prisoners.<br /><br />The second half of the book delves specifically into logotherapy or the drive for meaning as the center of human need and behavior. It is a basic idea that has been taught under different names in a range of religions and philosophies.<br /><br />Very easy reading and a great addition to any intellectual library.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|After only one use my kindle' s performance was greatly improved...  this app is now my go to for regular maintenance.  The for a great app!!
B000LB7G00|5.0|I've had one of these for about 2 years. I still love it and it works great. I use it for Solidworks and Altium (electronics design). It adds a whole new level to my 3D design. It makes inspecting my objects so much easier. It's worth it just for the latter, but something strange and great happened when I started using it. As I was slowly rotating my objects it seems to add a 3D feel, like the objects popped out, even though it's only on a 2D monitor. I know it's just persistence of vision, but a bonus! Granted, it will take a bit to get used to the control, but I am so used to it now it's automatic. Like, do you think about how to control the mouse or just do it? This device is always by my mouse.<br /><br />Reliability is great but occasionally I start a program and it doesnt work, I then execute \\"Start Driver\\" from the Start Menu and it works again. Not sure why it doesn't just keep the driver loaded all the time. I'm not docking a point because it's still 5 stars for me.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|This film holds up fairly well. Filled with enjoyable moments that are enhanced by Carrey's delightful silliness. Extra words at the end to pad review.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|well, i don't much about material but i think it's pretty good.<br /><br />good colour, good shape<br /><br />nice product!!!! luv it
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Easily my favorite trivium album as well as album in General, when I got it I listened to it nonstop for about a week, favorite song on it by far is Into The Mouth Of Hell We March
B0098QBEXO|5.0|The movie was beautifully done and the acting was really good. This movie had me laughing and crying and if your a Benedict Cumberbatch fan this is a must see.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story wasn't what I expected. Characters  all had their own trials they were going through  and their stories all related to one another. The author then gave you a different incite with her &#34;what if&#34; factor and how the outcomes might have been different.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book is a very detailed and carefully written account of how we mismanage nuclear weapons systems.  The single point that emerges from this book is the inherent danger of nukes and the resistance to common sense in the design, execution and mismanagement of these weapons.  While it is true that there has never been an accidental explosion of a nuke on our part, this should not lead us to rest easy.  The single most disturbing fact that emerges here is that the same people, most likely with the same mind-set, are still in charge of our nuclear security today.  If it doesn't scare you, nothing will.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I was hoping for a more specific menu. However, they do give you general guidelines to follow to obtain better health.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Love the album but like the online down load that you can do to have it right now when you buy it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was amazing I could not put it down even at work! Made my marriage a little more interesting!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Love the album but like the online down load that you can do to have it right now when you buy it.
0689853491|5.0|The kids love this book, and love &#34;reading&#34; it themselves! Cute, repetitive text allows them to memorize and retell easily!
B001F6ZIXW|1.0|This show is pure &#34;chick lit&#34;, cleverly disguised by a vail of what women would perceive as masculinity. Yes the show has motorcycles and guns; but don't be deceived guys. This is a soap opera through and through. I watched it, I admit it. If you choose to make the same mistake: I would advise you to keep your sanity by hitting fast forward every time Gemma talks.  To be fair the show does have...on average ..15-20 mins of guy friendly kick ass action per episode. If you are looking for a show to watch with your wife, It does probably beat the real house wives of wherever town. Best of luck gents!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I never thought I would say this but Bruce Willis was in this movie and it was boring.  I fell asleep twice in it and I never do that in one of his movies.  It was good and had a decent plot but very low budget action.
B000ZN258M|5.0|Yes, my review of Dig Lazarus Dig is biased and prejudicial.  I am a dyed in the wool NC&TBS fan and won't apologize for it.  I expected to like this album and I was not disappointed. The tracks here are more toward the rock end of the NC&TBS spectrum which is not surprising since it is one of the earlier releases.  Not as heavy as their Birthday Party days however.  I won't give my impressions on each track as other reviewers here on amazon have done that far more succinctly than I could hope to and I appreciate them for that.  I trust the reviews of 'real people' infinitely more than any 'professional' review as we actually pay for the items we review and we aren't concerned with rocking the boat when we critique.  For me, track 11 - More News From Nowhere is the most fun on the album.  It's also a perfect ring tone ;-).  I also really enjoy the darkness of track 6 - We Call Upon The Author.  While these are my favorite tracks there aren't any on this album that I don't like.  It isn't the ballad side of the band here,  It's more the Lyre of Orpheus side with a bit more rock to it.  If you are a fan of the NC&TBS whole body of work you will probably enjoy this.  If you really only enjoy the ballads this may not be the album for you.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I love this app. It's filled with puzzles for the little ones based on which letter they pick. They get to help the crabs build letters, match cloud shapes and even help put together the most adorable animals. It's fun with an educational value and I couldn't be happier!
1476727651|5.0|Picking up where &#34;The Shining&#34; left off, this book is a ride into the life of young Danny Torrence all grown up & known as Dan, or &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34; in his new profession at a local hospice.  As he was once taught before, he is not the only one with the gift of &#34;the shining&#34; & he comes to meet someone with a more powerful gift than his own.  The book is perhaps a story within a story and both ultimately overlap into one riveting tale of whatever became of the young boy who survived at the hands of his father & the Overlook Hotel.  If you're a King fan you will not be disappointed & find it hard to put down.  I read it in just under 5 days & have friends who did so in anywhere from 1-3 days, it's that good!  Will they make a movie of this one?  Time will tell, but as always, the writing is better than anything Hollywood will ever do.  It may help to re-read the Shining before this one, to keep it fresh, but you will find small excerpts here & there referencing its predecessor.  Well done Mr. King, cheers!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Once Harry Bosch has a suspect in his sites, he grabs on like a bulldog, and doesn't let go, even when he's stomped to the ground. Connelly's Harry Bosch novels are many, but I have liked them all. I would like them better if he showered his readers with a little humor during his meanderings. Nevertheless, you will enjoy this one enough not to put it down.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Wether a Star Treck fan or not you will like this film.  This follows up nicely with the Star Treck produced in 2009 while not being a sequal.  Great graphics, special effects and character development.  If you like the Sci-Fi genre then this is worh a watch.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I did have a problem getting it to work with an Actiontec C1000A router, but plugging another router into it and connecting to that network seemed to work well.  Also turning off the Actiontec's firewall works too but it keeps switching it back on every few days or so.
B005HNMPBM|4.0|Let me start by saying that I did not read the comic books.  It had a good storyline and was fun to watch.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars was that it could have easily done a better job in character development.  It was a great action packed film that I have seen several times.  If you like comic books or the X-Men series you will enjoy this film.
B006WZIEMS|5.0|Truly a classic.  Arguably his best album.  Old but ageless.  No filler; every cut is a worthy effort that can stand on its own.
B002K99P7S|5.0|I always love watching stories with Wolverine and this movie was no let down.  Character development was good and the back story on this X-Men character was great.  Fun for anyone who likes X-Men.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Mystic River should have won Best Movie. In my mind it did. Congratulations Mr. Eastwood and thank you for the well crafted story.
B008B11RLQ|5.0|I have not had a chance to listen to the entire set yet.  I just received it. The two that I have meet my expectations.  I am very pleased!!! If you enjoy Elvis, this is a must have.  So many songs!!  Get buy!!
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|The plot was clever and had a good twist with clues to figure out at least some of the mystery; the narrator and central figure had a self deprecating humor that was alternately nice and then annoying... so this was a good read but not great.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|I read as much as I could of this ridiculous book. The characters were underdeveloped. The writing was poor and childish. The plot, if you could call it that, really didn't exist. A child is abducted, raped and murdered by a deranged man who dug a hole in an open cornfield, which no one sees. The abuse, rape and murder of the child is graphic and unnecessary. The girl is in a fantasy heaven which is truly unbelievable in its description. A heaven I would never want to go to. If this is Sebold's heaven she lacks imagination and doesn't seem to have a God base to draw from.<br /><br />The dead child is able to trade places with a child friend on earth, but instead of leading her devoted and loving father to who murdered her, she has sexual encounters with her earthly boyfriend, which is ridiculous and utterly absurd. She watches her family from her fantasy heaven as her father continues to hunt for her killer and her older sister has sex with many boys. Her mother abandons the family. Nothing in this book is realistic or heart captivating. This book wasn't worth the time, money, nor the energy to try to get through it. The killer continues to rape and murder, leaving huge trails directly to him. But the cops are made out as bafoons and couldn't find a clue if it was presented to them. This whole book was a disaster from beginning to end. Read the 1 star reviews before the 5 stars to get the real picture of the book. This is a poorly written, thoughtless book. Nothing about it worth reading. Stay clear of this book, or any other macabre attempts she tries writing.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Its definitely a great game with no permissions...its nice to see something other than Angry Birds and Amazing Alex from Rovio.  Makes you think but its not too tough.  Its fun and relaxing.  Animations are cute and I think everyone would like it.  Definitely a 4-5 star game.
B000001EHS|5.0|These original songs are much better than the tribuate stuff or the remix they did on these song. Great best of CD!
1250030951|5.0|I probably shouldn't even review Fangirl. It's not like there was ever any question about whether or not I'd love it. I devoured Eleanor & Park and Attachments earlier this year and absolutely loved them. So I knew I was going to love Fangirl. It's not even fair for me to review it but I'm going to anyway.<br /><br />To be completely honest I didn't really know what Fangirl was about. Like I said, it was love at first sight so I didn't care. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the book takes place in college. Cath just started her freshman year and her world is kind of crumbling around her.<br /><br /> Fangirl has so many wonderful layers. Family plays a big role. Cath has an unstable father, a wild twin sister, and an absent mom. Cath struggles with all those things and her crippling fear of venturing out into the world of college. There's also a great subtle friendship that I loved.<br /><br />Then there's the romance. Oh my goodness. At first I didn't know who the love interest was. I really appreciate that looking back on it because when it happened I literally SWOONED. Really, I did. The romance was so sweet. Cath and her swoon worthy boy don't seem like the best match at first but they're a beautiful fit.<br /><br />I think all of us bookish, nerdy girls could see a little of ourselves in Cath. She writes fan fiction and has a healthy obsession with Simon Snow (a Harry Potter esque book series). She's shy and would rather spend her time with people on the internet than in real life people. I don't know about you but that sounds an awful lot like me.<br /><br /> Fangirl has so many elements to love. Rainbow Rowell captures all of them so well. If you're looking for an honest portrayal of finding your place in the world look no further. Plus, it's witty and just plain fun!
B00B9E29CI|4.0|Good case studies and references, but lacks practical advice for parents. The key points of this book could be summarised in a few pages.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This BOOK is insane. The thoughts that you generate from the exercises in this book are phenomenal. I don't understand what happened but I really am doing my dream work now after thinking I was going to need unemployment again.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I was one that missed this show on its first showing.  I am mad at myself for missing it as it is a great show. It has a great story line, subtle extended stories throughout the season that I am sure would lead to many plot twists and some great characters.  It had adventure and romance.<br /><br />If you like space/sci-fi you will enjoy this. You like westerns you will enjoy this. You like watching tv, you will like this.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Set up on Apple devices is amazingly straightforward, but on PC with network set up. Wilress streaming is fantastic without any codes connected and great on Apple devices, but via Chrome on PC... Chrome based casting is not available on Apple devices... So it is still good and bad.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I have always been a SCIFI and Horror buff, but this show transcends both by providing a more human aspect, and is a constant reminder that its not the dead we have to be afraid of, but its the living!
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|I got this game because I like to sew...you buttons and scissors... anyway I LOVE it. The graphics are awesome  and it is so addictive you can't hardly stop. It really challenges you mind and makes you have to think. It looks childish BUT it is not. If you like games that makes you use you think this is the one. I highly recommend this to anyone.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|This is an ok series but it is missing something. It definitely does not have the same feel as the movie as far as story and direction. I think if it does not change I am afraid it will not make it past this season.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this game is awesome but I found that the update messed everything up. I had a whole bunch of stuff before the update but after the update, all my stuff is gone. I just wasted all that time getting stuff and POOF it's gone.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|one of danny boyle's best... soundtrack is great too. perfectly intense throughout. Needed more Rose Byrne though. amazon is making me type more words, at this point
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is like the best game in the whole world minecraft is like the best game in the whole world minecraft is like the first game that's ever been made you mine you craft you fly make cakes make bread even plant your own garden and the last thing you can do is kill all kinds of monsters zombies,skeletons,so like what I was saying please buy this game it is so cool<br />In
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great book. I didn't want to put it down. I did an advance order to get on the 1st day available and had the entire book read in 3 days.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this forever, I'm soo happy that it's in the Amazon app store now! I'm so addicted, it's not even funny. Gtg this candy isn't going to crush itself lol :)
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This was an awwwwwwwwwwwwwwsome app<br />It was really helpful  for for a taking pictures<br />And also for a cam corder
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and I like the fact that you have so many choices for the game.
B0020PV1YW|5.0|Totally satisfied. For an item this old I had many doubts, but the book came in almost perfect conditions and it was everything I was expecting.
B007HJ96NO|5.0|Before I even watch the movie, I have heard the beautiful main theme from this movie all the time. So I always have this impression about it the same as the song itself.<br />After I have seen this movie, every time I heard that song I have already heard for thousands of time, It will simply took my breath away.<br /><br />This movie will definitely go into my DVD/Blu-ray collection. Well, DVD is enough though, but just loving it so much might make you regret it someday that you haven't get it in Blu-ray.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|Hey I love this app but star girl I way better but live this one add me L768C subs bsb
B00447G2PM|5.0|beautifully done kinda short but perfect for keeping the kids attention. The 3D is okay but the movie is worth the money
B008M721MS|1.0|Had app on my kindle fire hd. I just deleted, would not let me get past sign in procedures. I tried numerous times, waste of time, delete.
B00D0N5CSO|4.0|This book really gives you the flavor of the English countryside and it's a good police procedural thriller.  I enjoy the Insp Banks series
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to set. The sound seems low but it has woke me each time. I would recommend for anyone that does not require a fire alarm to get up.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was truly a page turner.  Fast paced action . Much shorter than usual King novels, but just as emjoyable
B00BAXTYDK|5.0|Even thought some of the actors changed, this is still very worthwhile in continuing the saga of Spock.  Love &#34;Bones&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was hoping that the player will be able to replace my WD TV Live, but I might have to wait till Google allows streaming from the local network shares (that was possible in the beginning, but not anymore). Since I'm not Netflix subscriber and don't watch Hulu the functionality of Cromecast is limited to watching Youtube (which works very well) and streaming from the Chrome browser. So far WD TV Live does much better job for me. I hope the Google changes their policy and will extend the applications list.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|We bought this for our god children who love the Disney Cars movies.  It was a big hit, of course.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I felt so bad for the children on The Train when they were hungry.  They did not know what awaited them at the end of the line, and I could feel their terror.  They were brave souls.
B006HL9G10|5.0|It has all the bells but none of the whistles. Very simple and intuitive interface. Nice sounds and features too. Recommended.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|World War Z is based on the book by Max Brooks, but about all it has in common is the title. The novel was about an outbreak of zombie virus, and it's spread around the world as governments, scientists & doctors struggle to understand what is going on & combat it. The film follows one person in a dash around the globe trying to find the source of the virus in an attempt to develop an antidote. The film starts out in the middle of a pandemic & the collapse of social order, with no clear idea of how or where it started. Brad Pitt plays a believable UN investigator, but he could have done this kind of role in his sleep, as he races around the world tryig top solve this crisis.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you expect it to be like the book you'll be disappointed, but on its own merits as a film, you could do worse.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|A little disappointing after Baraka, one of this producer's prior products.  The out-takes and production background was almost of greater interest than the &#34;show&#34; itself.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|I liked kalinda's stories but they have been less frequent. This season seems like a build up to the next, which should prove very explosive. I'm not sure I like the way will is going to react once alicia makes a decision; which ever way she goes but they are dragging out her decision in this season. It seems like so many are turning their backs on one another and i hope it resolves.
0385345054|4.0|This book is just beautiful - vivid color throughout, beautiful projects, amazing photography.  If you want to just look and dream it's a five-star book.  But when I set out to do my first project I was met with materials that called for, for example, \\"gold cord\\" - with no idea what type of cord or how thick or what material it was made of.  And worse listed as the main material needed for this project - \\"Japanese paper.\\"  Well there are many types of Japanese paper and it wasn't the usual washi/chiyogami paper with the designs.  I really wanted to make this beautiful flower arrangement, but I read and read the instructions and cannot quite figure out what I need to use for certain things.  I will improvise and hope for the best but I am disappointed.  The second project I decided to try instead also had some vague materials I could not figure out so I have yet to make anything, though maybe the others are more clear - I just kind of lost heart and haven't looked at any more in detail.  Since I have never made paper flowers I feel unsure and don't know what to use for these items that aren't clear.<br /><br />That said, the book is worth the price for inspiration, and I have ordered another flower making book that hopefully has more clear instructions and then maybe I will feel more confident improvising on the things I want to make in this book.  If anyone makes the ikebana-inspired peonies with white pine and knows what kind of Japanese paper to use, let me know!
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Love it the best love love love it . Wish there where more like this.  I play it all the time and it s not boring
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this series so far.  Plenty of mystery and suspense. Cannot wait to read next installment.  My only problem is that I do not understand some of the British terminology.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Now bad at all! It's exceptionally good when taking pictures in the dark some how they lighten up into a great photo.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|t his game of all the escape games. is the best. you have to think. its not an easy game.but lots of fun......
B005EGXTHG|4.0|My niece was reading the Hunger Games and told me I should too.  At first I thought this was a barbaric story, but I stayed with it.  Catching Fire is book two and the Games are over...or are they?  Victors don't enter the games again, that was the agreement.  President Snow has other ideas, will this be the end of Katniss or Peeta; or is this the end of the Capitol?  I find myself caught up with the story and want to see President Snow and the Capitol brought to justice.  Definitely a good read...now book three: Mockingjay
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|This is a good movie with a great story.  Excellent acting by Will and Jaden Smith.  Will Smith's acting in this feature was distinctly different from prior acting in movies and series.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I used to hack games like this but this app makes it so much easier I just love this app it is the best
B00FJTYDKK|1.0|I chose a one star rating due to the demeaning nature of this family movie toward role of the father.  Not recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fantastic book! Wasn't sure I would like it as it was so many years after The Shining, but you  just  can't  beat  the writing of Stephen King.  King and a few other writers have the knack of writing books that I just can't put down until they are finished and then leave me wanting more!<br />This book fills in with Danny's life as it probably was after his disturbing childhood and then goes forward.<br />Think about how some people have an intuition or premonitions... makes you wonder, but you know they have it and pay attention to it....then you can get a better feel for what Danny and a few other characters use in their lives.<br />Immerse yourself in this book and enjoy hours of \\"lose yourself\\" reading.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I love the app because when I don't know what 2x23 I can look on the<br />calculator and there it is.
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|Very easy to attach to your camera (just need to make sure you don't scratch your lens). There wasn't a big difference from the DCR-150 I already had, but it did get me closer.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|After hearing so many people talk about Downton Abby over the past few seasons,especially senior citizens like myself,I decided to order season 1and 2.As soon as I received it I began watching.I fell in love with it and waited anxiously for season 3 to arrive.I am now very much awaiting for season 4 to begin.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Purchased for my son. He absolutely loves it, especially since it charges off the game system and does NOT need batteries which was a pain!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I have watched 1 and 2. I loved watching this series.  Thanks amazon prime for having it on instant video.  Looking forward to season 4
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|It's very entertaining and you won't get bored with it. Animations are very realistic and very life like. Well worth getting for such a cheap app.
B00AEBBAEK|4.0|The movie is really the important part of the deal, and the disk played and everything. The case is extremely cheap, and as crazy as I am about the movie, I was a bit disappointed when I got it in the mail and saw the crappy casing. This is a phenomenal movie that can be watched and appreciated over and over again! The songs are wonderful, sets are amazing, acting is unbelievable, and the story is bone-chilling! Some people prefer the Angela Lansbury version, but Tim Burton is a genius and created a masterpiece with Sweeney Todd.
0399255370|3.0|Like the story.  Kinders like other books about colors better.  It's a great concept, but maybe too deep for kindergarten.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you have never seen Firefly, I highly recommend watching it. I am not usually into stories set in space (with the exception of Red Dwarf), but Firefly was an incredible surprise. There are no words that express just how amazing this show is. Once you are a fan, you are a fan for life!
159562015X|5.0|Not only is this good for individuals...especially someone looking for work to help identify your own personal strengths but it is also great to do in groups.  This book has helped working relationships in our office to identify key players who have the stegnths you need to get a project or task done.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I think it is appropriate for kids too.  The story is well done, the actors are excellent, and there is no potty humor or crudeness in it which is unusual.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The Walking Dead is the best show on TV!!! I have never been so addicted to a show than I  am this one.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Danny Torrence  , his shining abilities are helping a young girl, Abra.  A must read for Stephen King  followers. I love the book.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|If you can pick this up at a decent price it's a must-have for any serious Genesis connaisseur (assuming you have the 5.1 equipment to play and make the most of it - I have an Oppo player, goo gear, good price). Nicely packaged, good bonuses.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|An easy way to take Kindle with you on your smart phone. I use it all the time to read books while in waiting rooms, waiting for others, etc...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Fantastic book.  Loved the characters,  The story line was unique and engrossing.  I've recommended it to everyone and immediately purchased another novel by Jojo Moyes.  Excellent writer.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Got the app to allow me to see the Weather Channel on my Kindle Fire (Non HD).<br /><br />Works great. Also have it on my Google Nexus as my primary weather source.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|The app does not scale to match the display ratio of the Galaxy S4. Since I can't adjust the ratio I can't play the game.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader allows you to open PDF's on your mobile device.  It works great on my Google Nexus.  Recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the movie. One to watch more than once. Love Josh Duhammel and Julianne Hough, both normal people. Okay fine... peachy
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is amazing...it works awesome on a kindle there is nothing wrong with it it is literally my life I mean like really though I'm obsessed.....get it now!!!!!!!!!!
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|I was scared I don't get scared easy but this movie is creepy scarey believable has me looking over my shoulder
B00B89WXYS|5.0|At first listen the songs kind of floated by, but as we go through life, we find meaning in songs that we didn't think we ever would. \\"Feel Again\\" stood out right away, but other songs like \\"Counting Stars\\" and \\"Preacher\\" I came to love. Great CD!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|A good book with interesting ideas but not so finished as his heroic fantasy type novels. Although not a fan of dystopian novels I read it with pleasure.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|What a beautiful DVD.  The most beautiful song of all is &#34;over the rainbow&#34;.  I love it.  Will enjoy more and more now that Hawaii is our new homeland.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Simple to play but the challenge increases as the levels go up. Enjoyable and absorbing. Makes the morning and evening transits just fly by. Thanks Big Duck!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Like many of you, I've read many &#34;alternate thought&#34; types of books. It's as though you know there's something to it but can't always hold on. The exercises help, as exercises should, to strengthen that &#34;spirit conscious&#34; muscle.  Well done.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Looked like the old  Japanese Godzilla movies. If you like those movies ,you all enjoy this one.Get out the sushi and  pull up a chair.
1439153663|3.0|Waited until the end of the book for something &#34;good&#34; to happen to someone! and that never never never happened!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The review title says it all.  I was given advice to stop downloading the updates.  99% of the update is the pop up ads.  So I have a few pop ups because I did a couple updates.  But the app is great and I use it often.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Hope I never run into a woman like the &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and if I do, will run the other way!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|for $35 you can't complain at all. Even if it was a $100 I wouldn't be complaining. YouTube, Netflix, Google Play music/movies, Chrome browser all work perfectly with this and I'm sure more apps will be coming in the future. Set up takes minutes. Works well with iPhones also
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game on Facebook and now I can on my Kindle Fire....You are so sweet...Thanks so much hope it is as good as on Facebook...
6305428042|5.0|THANK YOU that was FAST and i'm super excited :)<br /><br />Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks :)<br /><br />I cant wait to see it with my neices and nephews .. Perfect timing for this season :)
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Nice movie to watch with your lady near a fire place. Romantic and very realistic. A little slow in the at the start, but it has a very nice endding.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We have watched each one and wanted them all on DVD.  The cost was cheaper to buy in a set.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for. Was able to work  easily on my phone.. Always have the Word of God available
1400032717|3.0|I think that I'm still not sure what to make of this book. It was entertaining and I liked it. But it was a lot of work, even for me. Sadly, there were a lot of characteristics that I shared with the main character. Too many, and I think that made me a little uncomfortable. There were many times throughout the book where I had to stop and say, \\"hmm, is that why I do that...?\\" or \\"I totally get where he's coming from!\\" Very unsettling for me. I guess that overall, I liked the book. It would have gotten more stars if the entire book would have been about the mystery that started the story and if all of the math problems would have been solved instead of just one at the back. Now I have to get out a pen and paper and try to remember how to do the quadratic equation...
B004UID2LC|4.0|This is a good app for downloading videos.  If only it could link to YouTube itself.  Try it for yourself.
1416955070|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Start to finish, I was intrigued by the characters. I think that had I not read the back of the second book before finishing this one, I would have been very surprised with the twist. As I did read ahead, I was kind of weirded out by where the story was going. But I got past that and still enjoyed the book. I am always hesitant to read books in a series because I like each book to have its own story with a start and stop, and if that doesn't happen, there isn't a clear ending to the book, I get frustrated. But this book ended well and with what I assume are minor stories that will continue. I think this is the first book that I've read since I finished Harry Potter, that I feel completely satisfied with the book. It is now among my favorites, I hope the rest of the series continues the same way.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Makes you want to get a harley and a gun and start a club. But then you remember you have a 4th grade football game to take your Kid to tomorow so instead you just live through the show :-).
0375842209|2.0|It appears that I'm in the minority about this book. I understand the importance of the story being told, and can appreciate that you don't usually hear it from the perspective of a young German girl. That being said, it just wasn't for me. I know the events happened (and it scares me that it may happen again in my lifetime, the way the world is going now) but I don't like to hear about it. I know life's not always a bed of roses, but I would have like to have seen a happy ending. It may have made up for the time that I feel like I wasted in reading this book. There were parts of the writing that I really enjoyed, the descriptions and emotions. But overall, there just wasn't enough for me to like it.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Drama with Testostorone. Hard to predict and no one is safe. a well acted show. Could use less commercials. Intense
0061122416|5.0|This book was amazing. It was chosen for our book club and I believe that everyone enjoyed it. It was light-hearted yet thought provoking. Serious yet funny. It had something for everyone and always kept you on your toes. It also had a nice twist ending.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This version has great music and very good life lessons for the grandkids.  I sing some of the songs to them before nap time and we both enjoy the songs very much.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I like what this app can do but when I try to post my pic on Facebook, it says uploading but when I check FB, its not there. What's up with that? And...there's no tab to share on instagram either. Make it work or else why bother?
1439153663|5.0|This well written book explores the plight of household servants, slaves or indentured servants in Virginia.  It explores the nuances of life on the plantation including relationships between, among and around plantation life.  It is a topic I had never really considered-the immigrant indentured servant.  The writing style is engaging and elucidating.  Thank you, Kathleen Grissom
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I am a horror movie buff as well as a thrill seeker when it comes to my taste in movies, if you share these qualities then \\"Sinister\\" will not let you down. It is hard to even talk about the movie without giving too much away and I hate to sound clich&eacute;, but this was definitely one of the scariest movies I have seen as of late. It does not fit the \\"Teen Scream\\" horror genre at all and has a solid plot that keeps you guessing. I am usually good at picking out the ending to movies and it took me up until the last 20 minutes to have this one even halfway solved (which is when the viewer should be putting it together). Highly recommend for those looking for a good scare.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it hours of fun keeps boredom minimum. love it love it. easy to use. don't know what else to say but fun easy
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Every single page was a delight- no filler, no dragging and endlessly interesting. I quickly went from hesitant with low expectations to devouring each savory word. This is Mr. King rolling in high form!!! LOVED IT!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works well....it does exactly what it is supposed to....will be great when they provide additional capability.  Haven't had any problems.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Paul is still making decent music. Maybe nothing on here will qualify as a hit song, but this album has many interesting tracks. I wouldn't recommend starting to explore Paul's music at this point (if you're a newbie), but this is a respectable album that compliments Paul's catalog nicely. I'm enjoying Paul's songs as he gets older. I'm a long time Beatles fanatic, and this is a welcome addition to Paul's music. Don't be scared! If you liked &#34;Flaming Pie&#34; and &#34;Driving Rain&#34;, this is yet another Paul McCartney album to enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for kids and adults alike. Terribly addicting at times. Graphics are great. Fast playing game that gets faster and faster.
B002KKCVT6|5.0|I wore my first pair for many summers and always appreciated the way they supported my arches. I haven't found any other sandals I like as much as these.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I think that this game needs more blocks. Just get Survivalcraft!!! Plus the world's should be bigger too. Other then that, it's pretty good.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Just finished Dr. Sleep. Great read. I'm very rarely disappointed with a SK book and was not at all this time. Really enjoyed this!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As a John Grisham fan I was not disappointed.  An easy read that had enough twists and turns to keep me reading as fast as possible.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Interesting plot, really creepy  \\"monsters\\".  The characters especially the adult Dan Torrance, were believable and easy to empathize with.  Fans of King and/or The Shining will be pleased.
B002C949AE|5.0|An amazing story of strength and perseverance! And the courage to stand up against the forces which tried to hold her captive in a primitive culture which does not value one of its greatest assets;  it's women! She not only rose above her own horrors but continues to fight for the millions of innocent little girls who face the cruel butchery of female sexual mutilation!<br />A must read for anyone who values women's dignity!!
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|I haven't gotten the chance to watch it yet but the packaging for the 3D BluRay is terrible, they just stuck the normal 2D BluRay and DVD on top of eachother, very susceptible to scratching the sensitive BluRay disc. They should've had an extra fold out spot for the extra disc, I've seen it done in most other multi disc offerings.<br /><br />EDIT: Having watched this since, it's a great movie which I enjoyed tremendously, if rating just the movie then it's probably four and a half stars but Amazon only does full stars in which case I'd have to give it four. I would've given it five stars before but I just found myself unable to watch it through again a second time which knocks it down a little in my opinion. I enjoyed it a lot, Charlie Day's character is awesome, I mostly only got the movie because he was in it and I like him in It's Always Sunny. It's got great action and some cool sci-fi details but some of the personal interactions just kept me from getting through it a second time, I got tired of the love story part of it, it takes away from how good this movie is without that coming into play. The packaging of the 3D blu-ray took it down another star as stated above.
B00CDTSQZW|1.0|I have TWO Blu-ray players and both have been upgraded to the latest firmware and it didn't play at all on one of them and it took 5 minutes on a black screen just to get to the trailers on my other Blu-ray player. I thought I was in the clear once the trailers started but once I got to the menu it just played in a loop over and over again with no way to hit play or forward, it would just loop and never end. It didn't even have an option for \\"Play\\" or \\"Scene Select\\" or anything. Just a 2 minute intro of scenes of the series.<br /><br />What a disappointing Blu-ray and I should have just bought the DVD version. I don't know why Blu-ray always takes forever to load and has so many problems but this is just ridiculous. All of the discs did the loop and one of them just stayed on a black screen for 30 minutes. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE BLU-RAY VERSION. Get the DVD set.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|great review of the geopolitical milieu of Jesus. He makes it very  clear that the Jesus of history is very different than the Jesus experienced by the church fathers  decades after his death.
1476715904|5.0|This book was a great read!  I fell into the story fast and wanted to stay there.  I really enjoyed Layken's POV.  She was extremely realistic and reacted to situations the way a typical teenage girl would!  She definitely had me laughing.  It was interesting to watch the characters experience the various stages of grief.  Each character was going through some type of loss at some point.  The fact that the book was layered with so many secondary relationships made it even more meaningful.  I loved the way Layken and Will interacted with their younger siblings.  Layken's mom Julia was an unforgettable character.  She was such a strong woman and left me with a lot to think about in regard to being a mother.  Her love for Layken and Kel was incredibly moving.  Even though there were some really sad moments, it was written in an absolutely beautiful way.  I usually hate books like this, but Colleen Hoover took a tragedy in life and made it amazing and inspiring!<br /><br />For full review on blog:  [...]
B00425S1H8|5.0|Had a lot of trouble finding a USB serial adapter that really works with Windows 7.  This is the one if you need to connect to serial from USB on Windows 7.
B00FGEO9NE|2.0|All around poor start to season 3. I will give it one more episode than I, like most people are out.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is fun. The numbers are called too fast. I paid 1500 amazon credits for 165 bingo chips and I never got them. The games are fun. Needs to be a little easier to earn awards. I'm not liking this new 14.99 a month elite player thing.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love the features. Nice to be able to wake up to a soft crescendo rather than a blaring alarm and the math problems kick start my brain in the morning.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Good movie for all different types of movie seekers.  It has action, suspense, and a little comedy.  I will be watching it again to see if I missed anything.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Worked great and was entertaining...I ended up getting the the paid version for 99 cents so I could have more levels and not see ads.
B00FKDVCJ0|3.0|I am a big Deep Purple fan. The concert releases this year have been great. It's not that this is a bad performance, it just suffers from comparison with others. The leads by Ritchie and Jon are lacking detail and are back in the mix. After 12 versions of Space Truckin' this is what I am listening for.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! Candy crush for my kindle fire!  Now I see what all the fuss is about.  Truly an awesome game for passing the time.  You can use strategy or just play for fun.  Fun for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The rumors are true. This game is very addictive. I count down the minutes to when I get more lives.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|OMG! I am so glad I did not buy this movie. Where do I start? This movie was Godzilla, Transformers, Cloverfield, and other similar low-budget monster movies. The acting was second rate except for Idris Elba, I loved him in Luther, this must have been step down from doing a top series like Luther, to this stinker! Hey, it's only my opinion, but what a let down, I think sometimes the ratings are over blown so you will rent them or foolishly buy them first. Thanks Hollywood, you did it again, with a lack luster bomb, that will probably make millions off of the toys they will make of the creatures, and people will buy them, like the sorry robots in this mess, it is all hype and commercialism, all bark and no bite, you could see something like this on Saturday morning cartoons.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it it so totaly awesome!  the only thing is without the update there is no relems. but you do not really need it anyways
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was easy read to enjoy while relaxing. Would read more in the series for easy reading.<br /><br /> I would recommend it for enjoyable reading..etc
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Very well done thought it was going to be a bomb but was very surprised. I will own this movie.
B00464AVXW|5.0|I found this to be a very exciting movie from start to finish.  The actors did a fantastic job in their portrayal of their characters.  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman (and, to me, the surprise), Kevin Spacey were perhaps the best choices for those parts.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual the &#34;master&#34; converts ordinary folk into evil beings, this time the road caravans of campers in their Recreational vehicles you ALWAYS see &#34;on the road&#34;, traveling in the USA! These vampires feed on &#34;steam&#34; instead of the &#34;classic&#34; folk in Salem's Lot favorite dinner.<br />Stephen does it again!  One of his best ..ever.<br />A must for (us) fans , &#34;constant readers&#34; and a nice new &#34;taste&#34; for newcomers to King..(yes....taste....LOL)
B00CHVJODE|5.0|We tend to pick up a lot of animated films because they are entertaining and the Croods is no exception.  Good fun, good characters and some clever \\"ideas\\" make it a fun romp through the trials and tribulations of being a caveman in a world that's trying to leave them behind.
0385350864|2.0|Bridget Jones and Helen Fielding introduced me to chick lit all those years ago and I have been a lover ever since.  Needless to say, as many other readers, I had literally been drooling at the thought of another Bridget Jones book (finally!!!).<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was 'hit' with spoilers a few weeks ago - despite my best attempts NOT to read any and was extremely disappointed from that point on.  Nonetheless, I pre ordered the book hoping, against hope that somehow the author could salvage something from her disastrous decision.  I actually got the book on Tuesday and only read it the next day because I truly was no longer even excited about reading it.<br /><br />The first few chapters had me completely confused - there is NO set up at all after all these years.  We just get thrown right back into Bridget's life without being able to situate ourselves at all which I could have lived with -if the rest of the story wasn't such a disappointment.<br /><br />For the first time in my life, as I read, I kept thinking 'Bridget shut up'.  She wasn't witty, warm or fun - she sounded like a 30 year old living the life of a 51 year old woman, wishing she was 30.<br /><br />There is no growth here, no humor, no life lessons and absolutely no warmth or fun.<br /><br />I am so upset - I wanted this book to be brilliant -instead Fielding just went ahead and wrote the story SHE WANTED TO WRITE without giving one second of consideration for her readers.  Nice Helen.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This has always been a family favorite. The chemistry between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is brilliant. Has some serious and sweet moments, but it's funny too.
1401311091|4.0|I enjoyed this book but found it was a little sexier than the TV show. A little more male fantasy, perhaps.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Would have been a great experience if only I had high speed internet connection and access to the online video services.
B00ESGYQWA|5.0|I loved this movie. I saw it in the theater and bought the DVD. I especially enjoyed hearing Joss Whedon's commentary on the details of production. I am a longtime Whedon Fan and I was very glad to see many members of his stable. I loved seeing Nathan Fillion, Scared as may have been of playing Dogberry, he nailed it. I think this movie will serve as a friendly introduction to Shakespeare for novices and a funfest for Shakespeare lovers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!!! Can not wait to read the last book!! Keeps you surprised and on the edge of your seat the entire time
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Simple changes making such a big difference to my hair's behaviour.  I also started treating my daughter's hair in the same manner - and how different does she look!
B005R32L66|1.0|We used Skype for years and appreciated that it was the 'original'. So when it came time to find an international calling service to keep in contact with our family member overseas, Skype was the natural choice. Unfortunately, the service failed miserably. First, you must purchase a subscription...seems like it makes sense, except that you must use your minutes each month or lose them. Unless you know exactly how long you're going to talk, you're better off finding a plan that charges by the actual minutes used.<br />However, more importantly than this, it simply did not really work. Our first call went through and the quality was decent. However, we were never able to make any calls to the same number after that. When I tried to reach customer service, I discovered that you had to go through about 5 layers of FAQs before you could finally choose to either 'live chat' with a rep or send an email. The 1st rep said we had tried to call when the line was busy; we accepted that explanation and tried again...no luck. This time, we had a back up plan and used another service - Bingo, no problem connecting! Guess it wasn't busy after all, just crappy service from Skype.<br />The kicker is that we were unable to get a refund for the unused minutes (even though we could never actually use them because the calls wouldn't go through) because that's their \\"policy\\".<br />Oh, and the single text we attempted to send never went through at all.<br />Oops, almost forgot one other thing - I attempted to cancel the subscription on-line and it appeared that I had been successful but, lo and behold, when the next billing cycle came along, we were auto billed for another month. Fortunately, we were able to get out of that and finally cancel because we hadn't used a single minute. Come to think of it, we probably couldn't have used any even if we had tried!<br />Bottom line: buyer beware...wasted money, unreliable service and no recourse if you aren't satisfied except to cancel service!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Lots of fun and challenging! I had a black and white version but the color version is much better. Well worth it.
1250030951|5.0|This review and more can be found on my blog, The Library Canary: [...]  I don’t know how to put into words how much I loved this book. It spoke to me on so many different levels. This was my first Rainbow Rowell book and I will definitely be adding her to my auto-buy list. This is also the first New Adult book I’ve read. I’ve shied away from the genre because from what I’ve heard and seen, it’s just raunchy YA with tons of unnecessary sex. Not my cup of tea. But Fangirl is what New Adult should be. A story about a young woman just trying to find herself and her place in the world. And no, there’s no raunchy sex. Thank god.    The main character, Cath, is starting college. Her twin sister, Wren, doesn’t want to live with Cath on campus. She thinks it would be best for them to meet new people. I think it’s a good idea, but Cath, not so much. She’s a very quiet, keep-to-herself kind of girl and any new situation makes her extremely anxious. She hides in her room for the first month of college, terrified of meeting new people. She even lives on protein bars because she doesn’t know where the dining hall is and doesn’t know what to do once she gets there. How does the line work? Where should she sit? These fears are those of every single college freshman. Cath was so raw and real to me. I loved reading about her struggles and remembering my own. We’re all human and we’re all uncomfortable with change. (If you tell me you like change, I’m going to call you a liar.) Cath is the type of character that everyone will be able to relate to on some level.    “Her dad was wrong about worrying. Cath liked to worry. It made her feel proactive, even when she was totally helpless.”    Cath writes fan fiction for Simon Snow, who apparently is like the equivalent of Harry Potter in this book. From reading other reviews, apparently there are some funny Harry Potter references, but since I haven’t read any of the HP books *hides from internet* they wentright over my head. I’ve never read fan fiction so I didn’t really relate to that side of Cath, but I did relate to how Cath hid behind it. She used the fan fiction as an excuse to not try new things, to not go out, to not finish tough assignments. Some people have complained about the fan fiction in the book, saying that they had a hard time getting through those sections, but I actually enjoyed them. It gave me another inside look into Cath and helped me better understand her.    There was a major conflict with Cath’s mother that added another interesting dimension to the story and also explained a lot about Cath’s personality. Cath’s dad also has his own issues and I liked watching Cath struggle with wanting to help her father and realizing that he needs to take care of himself, learning that she can’t use him as an excuse to not live her own life.    “She didn’t trust anyone, and that was a problem. A fundamental problem.”    Not only was Cath a great character, the supporting characters were fantastic as well. Reagan, Cath’s roommate was hilarious and had me cracking up the whole time I was reading. Levi was the most adorable guy ever. You couldn’t help but smile whenever he was around. Cath’s sister, Wren, is a bitch throughout the book, but I think she was just as lost as Cath. She only dealt with it in a different way.    This book spoke to my soul. It affected me on such a personal level. I could relate to so many things going on in this book. I felt what Cath felt. I felt what Wren felt. These characters worked their way into my heart and are never letting go. I got so many feels from this book. I laughed, I smiled, I cried. Oh geez, I’m crying again writing this. There are no words to describe how much I loved this book. It was just perfect. I will be recommending this book to everybody I know. Go read this one guys. It was just incredible. Happy reading all!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been looking for the real Candy Crush game and only found fake ones. So happy to finally have the real Candy Crush. Now I can see what all the hype is about.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|No support for note 3. If there is an update so that I can enter words, I'll change my review.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Not his best work.  His Way of Kings is better, as is Warbreaker. I recommend these other books. Happy hunting
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What can I say...It hooked me from the get-go...  Great book per usual from the master.  (note that it also connects to Joe Hill's NOS4A2 as well as the Shining)...Although it could be read as a stand alone, for full enjoyment, I'd recommend having read both books prior to pick up on all the fun references.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Not what I thought it was going to be. The plot is almost non-existent. If you want almost 2 hours of non-stop action and explosions, you'll like it. I didn't finish it all the way through. My wife trogged through it because she likes zombies.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It wasn't the &#34;edge of your seat&#34; thriller I expect from King, but still a good read. I was pleased overall.
B00FVS4EUI|1.0|If there is no recoil when a firearm is fired that's instantly a sign of a horribly directed show. Its simple this show just proves that Americans are truly stupid and for some reason are in love with watching mindless shows... This is coming from an even dumber Marine Corps vet. But i see right through sellout material... keep milking it AMC! Also please kill CARL because he is such a pathetic actor.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Fire the guy that made this. OK, that's extreme but wont install. Please fix this bug. Please, a lot of people want this game and you not fixing this bug will cause loss of profit. Think about it like this, you don't fix this and nobody buys ingame content like glu credits/coins. Sorry Glu, you messed up pretty badly.
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson has a whole shelf of nonfiction works to inform general readers of the historical past. His works are excellently written, witty and filled with anecdotes and events you won't discover in your high school or college history class. Bryson's latest book \\"One Summer\\" is an entertaining and eye opening look at the American scene in that distant year of 1927. What a year it was! The 456 tome is filled to the brim with interesting historical figures covering a wide range of activity from air travel to baseball to flag sitting. I was hooked on the book from page one until I devoured it in two days!<br />  Among the figures and events covered we learn more about:<br />a. Charles Lindbergh the stoical anti-Semitic mail aviation pilot who flew solo over the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Paris in May 1927. Lindbergh was the first person to achieve this feat winning worldwide celebrity. Many pages are written dealing with other early aviators and the dangerous life of a pilot.<br />b. Babe Ruth: The Bambino of Bat who built Yankee Stadium with powerful homeruns and a colorful lifestyle hit sixty home runs that memorable year helping the Yankees win the World Series. Meanwhile he was cheating with the wife of teammate and future Baseball Hall of Famer the great Lou Gehrig.<br />c. Sensational murder trials featuring the likes of anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti and Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray her corset salesperson lover are covered in depth.<br />d. The career of Henry Ford the carmaker and anti-Semite provides fascinating reading.<br />e.

B0058RCVYS|5.0|This movie was excellent - very well acted and poignant.  Highly recommended, especially if one is a fan of foreign films.
0061733199|5.0|This is the most comprehensive, well researched book ever published on survival. John &#34;Lofty&#34; Wiseman has made videos, written several other books and taught countless members of the SAS how to survive in any climate in the world in any weather. He also teaches survival privately now. Most every other book on survival has reference this book, what does that tell you? Tells me that I need not look much further.<br />it is good to be prepared and this book can help any one from a Prepper to a lost hiker, obviously want to read it first or make sure it is in your back pack. It teaches how to cook food, collect food, identify poisionous animals, fish, plants, and fungus from the ones that are safe to eat or be near, how to make fire, get rescued, leave trail signs for rescures to find. I mean name the survival situation and I bet it's addressed in here.<br />Learn to make a gil neat for catching fish, Make a pine needle tea for an enrgy boost when lost in the woods. Make a rabbit snare, Dress a wound, make a shelter for yourself. the list is long and like most things from the Brits . . . Meticulously thorough.<br />A great easy read packed full of live saving information. Don't leave home without it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We bought this so the kids could watch shows on the big screen TV.  We watch a lot of educational shows like Magic Schoolbus from Netflix and shows from PBSkids.org.  The Chromecast works flawlessly with Netflix and Youtube.  My only wish is that it would work automatically with Hulu.  You hear that Hulu?  Oh well, it works with the Chrome browser which means you can watch anything.<br /><br />Our TV has HDMI inputs and a USB port, so I've been using the USB port to power the Chromecast.  The only downside to that setup is you have to wait a few seconds for the Chromecast to boot up and connect to your wireless when you turn your TV on.  If you're impatient it comes with a DC wall adapter so you can leave it powered on all the time, even when your TV is off.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Me Before You keeps your interest throughout the book.  The characters are believable, and it is so interesting seeing life from each of the main characters perspective.  The ending is never totally obvious, which keeps the suspense.  Great book!
0920668364|5.0|A classic that I love to read to my boys (often with tears).  Purchased for a friend who just had a son, and she said she cries every time she reads it to him.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this plot and the genuine characters in both Silo 17 and 18.  If you feel at home reading something different, exciting and new please read Wool, it was more than a great read, it allows the reader to be fully satisfied.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Incredible voice and lyrics.  Essential to every music lovers collection.  Deep meaning and one can relate to the lyrics. Definitely great purchase.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is better than being there in person.....you can just imagine setting in the Royal Albert Hall in London England!
B003QSLDTA|5.0|Great movie, loved it! It's hilarious, touching, and awesome. I highly recommend it, Lohan and Curtis both did great acting!
B001Q4Z5Z4|3.0|Great action and visual effects. the story and acting is average at best. but if you like action this has some good one liners in it and cool race scenes.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|This is a great movie.  I just loved it.  I didn't know it was a sequel but when I watched the first movie it wasn't as good as this one.  Great movie!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have never read a book by this author before but this was such a good book. It was a fun, emotional, and interesting read. I got it on my Kindle. I plan to get another one of her books soon!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was different than I thought and in a good way had me wondering what was going on until the very end.  It was very good and recommend it for a family to watch.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|I know the official release date hasn't arrived yet, but I pre-ordered this Blu-ray from another online company and it came in today, Friday, October 18th.  First of all, it starts with interviews of the band members with pictures of the group from the beginning until now leading up to the start of the Viva Hysteria show.  Then, WOW..... The sound is totally INCREDIBLE.  Amazing video board behind the band as they play and this band has never sounded better. The drums will actually rattle the windows in your home.  Joe's voice is the best I've heard him sound in years. So anyone that was afraid that the show wouldn't transfer from live to video with great intensity, you can lay your fears to rest!!!!! I didn't see the show live but this Blu-ray is the first live show I've seen that can compete with the Led Zeppelin Blu-ray Celebration Day!!!!! I haven't watched the \\"Ded Flatbird\\" shows yet, but I can't wait to see the guys perform live stuff from the first album, \\"On Through The Night\\". For any fan of great ROCK MUSIC, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection!!!! Thank you for your time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|They should add mine carts, mine tracks, boats, if you agree then say yes<br />This is worth 7 bucks there should  be more stuff like I mentioned.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|My husband and I loved this series.  He loves politics, and I enjoy good acting/great characters and great writing.  It's a more &#34;adult&#34; version of West wing, with a dark side and lots of ruthless behavior.  High energy storyline, and we loved the 1st person narration by Kevin Spacey throughout.  He is brilliant.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I'm still new at this and I haven't discovered all the functions yet but overall I see that it's easy to surf, to read. It would be very recommendated if I can 'click to see meaning' of words with provided kindle dictionary.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Very disappointed that Google decided to pull back the ability to stream any Chrome browser tab to your Chromecast. If that ability were still enabled, this product would be a 4 out of 5 stars. If Google had more content providers than ONLY youtube, then this would be 4/5 stars. If it had both, 5/5. Don't buy this until more content is available or if you're fine with only playing youtube videos.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I read this quickly & easily. It was historically interesting and a very moving story. I've recommended it to my 14 yr old.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever! I loved it so much!You really need to buy this app right now!You can even update it!I mean it is only $6&middot;00!Buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy!
B00F880BWG|4.0|Great quality. Great episode. A good start to what is sure to be an amazing season. Can't wait for the real gore and grit and craziness to begin.
B004USRKX8|5.0|why write a review now ? because this cd is so beautiful i had too !! i discovered it researching the roots of the planet earth rock and roll orchestra :: a wonderful collection of music and talent that's a great snapshot of the early 70's. the cd features guests ; jerry garcia, grace slick, neil young, graham nash, joni mitchell, and many more from around california. the whole release is a beautiful collection of what david was doing and does do, when at his musical best ::: lovely harmonies and interesting songs. as a lifelong csny fan i was a little surprised i had not discovered this before now. i am very glad i did and  have continued exploring more early csny music as well as the other members of this group of musicians. if you have not heard this i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes csny or other acoustic music from the early 70's..it has quickly become one of my favorites :: enjoy!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic little device. Does exactly what it claims. No trouble to set up. Plan on purchasing more for Christmas gifts.
0525478817|4.0|I read this book for an outside reading assignment in my Honors English Class. When I had first heard about The Fault in Our Stars, I was not quite sure that I would like it. Several people that I had talked to had suggested this book, but I still was not sure. I was afraid that it was going to be a depressing book about cancer. I decided to give this novel a try for my reading project, and I am very glad that I chose to read this heart-warming novel.<br />The Fault in Our Stars is centered on the life of 17 year old Hazel Lancaster, who has thyroid cancer. Hazel attends a weekly cancer support group, which she typically dreads going to. But one day, at support group, Hazel meets the charming Augustus Waters.  Augustus and Hazel fall for each other and have an adorable relationship. Eventually, their medical problems cause a tragic complication in their relationship.<br />I personally thought that The Fault in Our Stars was an excellent book. This book had my emotions going wild. At times, this novel had me laughing, and other times it had me crying.  When I originally heard of this book, I thought it was going to be a cancer book. I was pleasantly surprised that this book was much more.  Yes, several characters in the novel did have cancer, but the story line involved much more than the everyday hardships that come with cancer. I could not put The Fault in Our Stars down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to read a great story.
B00AP5Z2F8|5.0|this book is a great help, giving great hints & tips in an easily readable & understandable format.<br />well worth its money.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, but that has come to an end so I needed something to fill the void. Not as as good, but I will read the series.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|it is a great game. the only problem I have had is the server keeps kicking me off. The game also restarted on me twice.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|So cool it amazing I can't wait to unlock every animal in littlest pet shop.I love this game so much
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have read most of Brandon Sanderson's books and this is one of my favorites from him. It has Brandon's signature style of interesting thought out magic systems that have actual rules and applies it to the super hero genre. If Brandon keeps putting out such quality work I will continue reading. If you like Brandon Sanderson or even the super heroes try this book out. Or if you don't like buying before you know an author is good Brandon has done something really cool that I hope other authors will do as well. You can visit Brandon's site and download one of his books (Warbreaker) for free and read the entire book to see if you like what he writes. I hope you check his work out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game I was waiting forever for this game to come on here this game is so fun and now I can just play it on my Kindle with out getting my laptop all the time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to set up. Took about five minutes (including an automatically downloaded update). Installing the companion app on several family cell phones also quick and easy. Minutes later family members were taking turns queuing up YouTube videos. No longer need the laptop and bluetooth keyboard and mouse to drive Netflix on the big screen. Works amazingly well. Utility for $35 can't be beat - even if only used for YouTube and Netflix.<br /><br />Now if they could get Pandora lined up ...
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I like this kind of movie ,it's very clear  and nice picture ,i went to see this kind of movie
076115678X|5.0|As a hairstylist with 15 years' experience, I thought I had heard just about everything related to hair. Boy, was I wrong! I am SOOO grateful to my customer who gave me this book a few years ago! It changed my life, for real! Now I actually love my hair! I recommend this book to every person who sits in my chair that has curly or wavy hair (as well as some fellow stylists!). There is an answer for just about every question or problem a curly girl (or guy) has. Even if you don't adhere to the suggestions in the book 100%, chances are that testing even ONE of the principles will help you out, and will make you want to try more!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my little  brother can play it to and he is really good at it!<br />ij f2f f2f bhbihi giving youth are not be the company sa and a h
B003JIPJRE|5.0|It was a great movie with a lot of action and a great story of our Caped Crusader. I would highly recommended.
0316067598|5.0|What a great book!!! Well written from the first to last page. It was hard to put down from the minute I opened it up. Marcus Lutrell does a wonderful job of painting a picture of what it takes to be a SEAL and a intense fight somewhere in the Hindu Kush. I would totally recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been reading the works of Mr. King for decades. He has been my inspiration as a writer and it makes me happy that after all these years, he's still got it going on.<br /><br />Danny Torrance is all grown up and he's battling the demons of alcohol. When he finds himself at rock bottom in a small New England town, fate guides him to his salvation. But not just his, because his gift is meant to be shared. When a young girl becomes the target of a band of other-than-human beings because of her gift of &#34;shining&#34; Dan acts as mentor and ultimately, the only one who can save her.<br /><br />This is a great read from start to finish and anyone who has ever been a fan of Stephen King will love the ride. It's one of those books you just don't want to end.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|The album has that hard bass sound that was so great in the older Black Sabbath.<br />I had to listen to it a few times to appreciate it.
B009LDD4V4|3.0|This is what was asked for and so I had to come through. I am glad birthdays only comes once a year
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I started it and got at least halfway done before setting it aside twice , unable to force myself to finish it.  I loved the previous books- everything about them - and kept wondering what was wrong, that  this one wouldn't hold my attention. Each time, I  assumed it was me; not the right mood, distracted by other things, whatever.  But I zipped through a dozen books between attempts  at  this one, none of those issues with them.  I am just incredulous that  I got so bored  with  it, over & over. I  couldn't really connect with any of the characters,  didn't really care enough about any of it to finish.  So, one more stab, determined to get as wrapped up as I had in his other books.  As before, it had been a while since I'd read it so I started from  the beginning to give it a fair chance to absorb me, and  did make it  further- about 3/4 done,  before I tossed it and said no more of this torture.  And now I am going to look at the other reviews and hope to see that I am not the only one...but it happens, I guess.  If there's a new book along later I will  read it, hoping the old magic is back for me.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I think I have everything released by The Band, but this boxed set is the crowning jewel. The packaging and artwork are great and I love the pictures, sone of which I'd never seen. But it's the music that does it for me. Crisp and clear. I can close my eyes and believe I'm in the front row, New Years Eve, 1971. My only regret is that there are only 2 videos.  Live performances of The Band are rare and always much desired. Too bad they weren't performing during this digital, cell phone camera era. Overall, this set is a must-have for a The Band fan or any music lover. I highly recommend this without reservation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game with wonderful graphics and no annoying ads. Must-have for anyone! The only thing that could be improved is the smoothness of the animations; it's smoother on my phone.
B005HSL626|5.0|Double thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every one in the house love's it. Fun game for all ages. We want more. keep it up good work
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Have been purchasing music from Amazon for years without any problems. No complaints. Easily download purchases to multiple devices with very little hassle.
0393342212|5.0|This is a great book! Someone recommended this book to me and I highly recommend it to all my friends with kids!!
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|My Granddaughter loves it. Looks great ! Of course she loves all of Sofia toy items. I recommend checking Amazon for things, it's usually a less expensive place to shop.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is awesome!! I love it the kids love it. it is do fun, with all the different blades and back fronds it is the best game on the planet!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Not as good as Boxer, but still very beautiful. Takes a bit to grow on you, but I love it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan paints a pretty vivid picture of the social aspects at which the apostles wrote about Jesus. Great read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever it is really worth it to buy! Really fun and exciting but updates should be pretty much quicker But simply awesome!! [RECOMMENDED] -=-
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|The Game is a film that keeps the audience engaged and guessing all the way. Great acting by Michael Douglas. And... A fun film of lessons.
0515153656|4.0|This first book of the Jack Reacher series is rich in detail, has wonderful character development and the plotting and pacing just cannot be beat.  Jack's lifestyle choice is a bit peculiar but works for the premise.  He's disenfranchised by choice.  He is also endowed with some amazing abilities and is undoubtedly one of the most intimidating male leads I've ever read.  Lee Child tells a story that grabbed on and rode me straight to the ending.  I couldn't wait to get the next book.  I'm going to use the cliche words 'gripping' and 'page-turner' because they fit perfectly.  Don't miss this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was very glad to find this game,its lots of fun and can keep going for hours. I had some driving games but I enjoy this one a lot more.
B00DJZR46G|1.0|There was a time that Elton was at the top of the music world but it was fairly brief.  His songwriting ability has really deteriorated over the years, unlike Paul McCartney who continues to amaze.  Well we'll always have Tumbleweed Connection.
B003JXUXPW|5.0|Gregory Porter has quietly become one of the great pleasures of modern jazz, listen and hear the influences mixed in with his very real and original phrasing, an apprentice and growing master rolled into one.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Great detailed fantastic setting, complex story, and interesting characters. I didn't want it to end. I would love to read more stories set on Earth with other characters.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been waiting for it to come back for months now... I love playing this game so much fun glad that it is back... I would recommend this to all
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|What an adventure!  This story of a young woman coming to terms with her mother's death takes the reader along on a fascinating physical and spiritual journey.  Cheryl Strayed earned my admiration as a person and as an excellent writer.  I highly recommend this book. It will continue in your thoughts long after you finish the last page.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is awesome. The game is awesome because it give u hints and this like that. That is about the game.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|My shut in brother in law has been wanting this a long time, I was so happy to get it for him, he loves it!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|It's a good story, and I love the classic. But for younger people to read, it is difficult to understand.... but otherwise it is a fairly delightful tale of a young boy.
0062197266|3.0|I cant really rate this as its a Christmas gift that someone recommended.....but im sure it will be appreciated :)
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great show i love these series upset though that amazon charges for the second season:( . had my attention! ! !
1623360277|5.0|Strong scientific data and # of medical and scientific studies, many personal stories of failure and success, and clear writing helps you understand the personal gain to be achieved as well as the global impact of food choices (i.e. gallons of water for meat production compared to grain).  Good recipes and grocery lists to begin and stay on this healthier diet..
1442337966|5.0|I loved it completely. It was the in depth info I wanted. I've listened to it at least  4 times.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Cada que termino de leer un libro del Sr. Coelho pienso que es el mejor, por lo que El Alquimista es mi nuevo favorito!  Veremos como nos va con  Manuscript Found in Accra! 😃
0316236535|5.0|One of my all time favorite books. Both kids loved It. Just bought for the 2 year old my daughter watches.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|The book was just a bit short but I like the story line and most of the characters. Definitely worth reading.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Although I missed the excitement of meeting the characters for the first time, as in the fist book, the suspense and pacing kept me reading. It is a great second book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I can't imagine a movie made of this. It would be fifty shades of non stop sex. That would be very boring after the first half hour<br />No a book I would recommend.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Enjoyed this much more than Eat pray love. This had a really good story and fascinating history too. Read very quickly.
B0009WFFS6|1.0|this dvd will not play on any of dvd or hd dvd that I own! I would like to exchange it for one that works!
B00EJOCAYW|4.0|Get this set it is really cool my child loves it it takes a while to build but it is very cool
B00F91H15W|1.0|An hour(s) + of my life I'm never going to be getting back....steer clear of this horrible movie! Had no real plot line and the characters were totally boring!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|If you're looking for a good keyboard for your phone or tablet, this is the app you want. Best keyboard app that's the best replacement for any standard keyboard.
0345803485|1.0|How...where do I begin?! Pages 3-10...or 500-514?!!!! Oh, I can't decide! Or perhaps, something in between?! Oh, I am so troubled. Ran out of Charmin Ultra Soft and I just can't decide for the life of me which pages to rip off to wipe myself.<br /><br />Penthouse Forums, eat your heart out! Our protagonist Ana is a young, naive, down to earth angel with an IQ of a dish rag.  Then, there's Mr. Grey. Young, billionaire, Tom Brady-gorgeous, with charm and grace, and always ready to slay the dragon that is Ana's vagina. What a perfect match!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you enjoy shaking your head in disbelief at how this book became so successful.  Not worth the 1.49 I paid at Goodwill.<br /><br />P.S. For good writing, please consider reading Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. Nothing erotic, just fantastic writing about a boy surviving the wilderness. &lt;3
B0024DF9MU|5.0|I love each of the relationship stories. It's not the kind of love stories you see in movies that doesn't happen in real life. This movie relates to real life. I've watched it so many times. Most favorite movie!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great read! While each story kept you guessing on what would happen next, also made you wonder how all three stories would connect. When they did, it made out not want to stop reading-wanting more!!! Loved the satisfying interesting epilogue.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|sucks that it doesn't work on first gen of kindle fire have been waiting amazon to get but still cant have not compatible with kindle fire sucks
B009AY04A8|4.0|It's a fairly fun puzzle game. Great looking graphics and a ok story to tie in the puzzle games together. Option to have timed 10 minutes for each puzzle is great for a challenge.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Dr P. Lays it all out in this and the brain book. We are poisoning ourselves and we can stop it by refusing to by the food that is on the market in most stores and by getting involved with out legislators.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|filmed in Tailand..very funny and more craziness than the first..probably get yourself killed if you tried it in real life..would be nice to watch with a group of friends..

B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Great storyline for a great movie. Loved the fictitious characters and location. All around good movie with not sexual content.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|To follow up on Danny Torrence's life is unbelievable. Stephen King delivers once again. I love the dark places of the mind his stories take you. What a wonderful story!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Back with A Vengeance!! This season promises all the excitement, blood and gore as the previous three. Can't wait to watch this one unfold!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I liked this series; It was a fun read but this book was just not finished. Normally, authors tie up story lines before finishing but a book but this book definitely did not. How disappointing! I feel like I was scammed! The author must have been under some completion time restraints to only sell 3/4 of a book, the publisher should be ashamed to let that fly.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|So far I like it. Something safe to do. Sure beats hunting for real. It's pretty easy so far. Good luck!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Excellent!! Hard to put it down. Now I need to watch the movie. Can't wait to start the next book.
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|I tried to type an email minutes after downloading this and it wouldn't let me view what I am typing. Completely useless if you want to write an email...
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Very good value for less than $20.  Size is small, but works pretty good. I have not exposed to water or the environment so I would not know how good perform under those circumstances.
0316228583|5.0|I finished this book three days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. One major theme of the book is how absolutely trapped disadvantage people are, especially the kids. If they don't get a hand up, they won't make it. It's not a matter of working harder or even of making better choices. It was quite an eye-opener. I think our Judeo-Christian culture is a bit schizophrenic--we have our Puritan heritage that says we deserve what we get, and the words of Jesus that tell us to care for the poor and downtrodden. More often than not, the Puritan voice is loudest and wins out.<br /><br />Throughout the book, as I learned more about the characters, I found first impressions had deceived me and I changed how I felt about them. They are complex, three-dimensional characters. Even the ones I despised had endearing qualities, and the &#34;losers&#34; really were some of the most admirable. It's not a feel-good read. If you like to think, this is a book for you. I came away more informed and changed. That's a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to see candy crush  saga is available for kindle fire ,  played it through Facebook and no I can take it on the go with me.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|Enjoyable book with some good turns in the story.<br />A bit lighter than Grisham's other work that I have read.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I had trouble getting through this book.  I only kept reading because I knew they were making a movie out of the book and am sure will see it since I'm from Missouri.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I'm a Christian believer and an avid history buff.  I've been using Amazon's great service for 15 years, purchased hundreds of items, and I've never felt compelled enough to review a product.....until now.  The concept of the book is intriguing, and after hearing the authors assertions on a handful of television interviews, I decided to get the book and approach it with an open mind.  As other reviewers have stated, I too enjoyed historical setting and the context of the time presented in the book.  Beyond that, there's very little to recommend about this book.  The author, despite his claims, is obviously biased in his view of Jesus and the jewish culture in general, and that is obvious from the opening passages of the book.  I don't have an issue with different viewpoints or beliefs, that's fine.  But when a 'scholar' proportes to be unbiased, stating only the facts, and then presents opinion, conjecture, including what supports his thesis, excluding what does not, he is being intelectually dishonest.  I have a bias, I admit it.  So does Mr. Aslan.  This is a not so veiled attempt to dismiss the person of Jesus, whether you believe that he is the literal Son of God, a figurative Son of God, or a great prophet, and basically say the Christianity is based upon some co-opted lie that has little foundation in what Jesus intended.  This 'historical' presentation of Jesus is also completely void of Jesus' teachings or even his supposed teachings.  I think to do so would run counter to what the author is trying to peddle in this book.  I can't imagine reading any historical account of any famous or infamous person without the author covering what they believed, thought, said, or the impact that they had on peoples lives, for good or bad.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We have been waiting so long for Candy.Crush Saga by King to be available for kindle fire. I am so happy It is finally here. Thank you Amazon.
B00D9RQO56|5.0|Such a great movie! My three year old really loved it! It's a movie we will be enjoying for a very long time.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. You get so attached to the bittersweet love story between gus and hazel. It was a beautiful story but it leaves you wondering what ever happened......<br /><br />Okay
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game was so AWESOME it is SUPER SIMPLE if u know how to play subway surfers or temple run don't worry it is to if u don't
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This game is a great game. It is fairly easy to get through, has a nice story line, and is priced just right. I have two mother games from Fire Maple games and enjoying playing them repeatedly. I love all the graphics  and the imagination behind the imagery. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys point and click games that are not too difficult and do not want to play &#34;hidden items&#34; type games.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am reading it now and I love it.  I can'twait to see in the theatre. I always buy the book as soon as it comes out.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|This album was a grower for me. On first listen I enjoyed it, but I think the mass of mid-tempo songs in the middle of the album did not immediately grab my attention. However, after a few listens I love the album. It is solid and I do not think there is a weak song on it at all. While I think A Dramatic Turn of Events had higher highs, it also had lower lows. While I would not put this album up along side Images and Words, Awake or Scenes from a Memory, I think it is just behind those.<br /><br />I think the loss of Mike Portnoy was the best thing that could have happen to them. They had become stagnant, yet the last two albums seem to have a better focus. This is especially true in the lyrical department. While the lyrics on this album are not the greatest in rock music, they are good and compliment the music well. Which is a big improvement from some of the embarrassing lyrics near the end of the Portnoy era.<br /><br />Highlights: Surrender to Reason, Through the Looking Glass, and Illumination Theory
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I just loved this series and was sad when it was over. This was a light show with many teary spots too. The humor was well done and kept me smiling as I watched. Whoever did the casting for this show did an excellent job. I just loved Dorcas, the Post Mistress.
B00E9P959O|5.0|The remix is nothing short of brilliant. You can hear so many subtle guitar, bass and drum parts that were drowned out in the original version. I am far from an audiophile, but the improvement is stunning. It made me fall in love with an album that I have always liked.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Very good follow up from The Shinning, need to read that first.<br />Very good for folks dealing with mental deamons.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Fast Zombies, that jump and can move like they can still think?  Did the person who wrote this ever read the book, or watch another zombie movie?  Horrible.  They didn't even stay consistent with the military portion of the book aka bombs don't work.  And what was with the no blood thing...if you cut off someone's arm and the person is human...THEY BLEED!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love that this is like a sequel to the Shining, although it is it's own story altogether.  I always enjoy the unbelievable storytelling that Stephen King brings to the table, and this book does not disappoint.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I have enjoyed all of Sanderson's books so far. Mistborn and Way of Kings are incredible, however I felt Steelheart was more of the same. In fact, it is basically the exact plot of the first Mistborn book. Super powerful god tyrant, rebel group that thinks they can overthrow the new empire, new recruit that wants to help but isn't sure how and ends up being the key to it all in the end.... He has done it before. I highly recommend Mistborn, but not so much this one.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What a great book!  Stephen King has done it again.  I am never disappointed by the amazing concepts he thinks up.  I love how twisty his mind is!  Fantastic!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|In my opinion, Goodfellas is one of the best gangster movies ever made. One viewing tip: if Pesci's character amuses you, don't let him know it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and at first the app would not install.  It was stuck right at the end for over an hour. After going to customer service they were able to restart the download.  Now it is AWESOME.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love that I can have multiple alarms!  also being able to have the alarm start quietly and slowly get louder is awesome and I love that you can set the snooze duration.  my only wish would be for some different sounds.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Great music!!! I listen to it all the time. Might go learn to play violin just to play like her!
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|listen to this album. really good stuff. S.O.S in Bel Air is great along with all the other songs. I listen to the album at least twice a week
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|This film is dull, ridiculous, a waste of time and a waste of money. It also makes no sense. One of the worst films I've ever watched.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|Unheard of energy efficiency, didn't even need a video card (not a gamer).  Heat generated is a fraction of my old Athlon and combined with 128GB SSD, Win7 boots in under 10 secs.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a lot of fun. I like to play it at night to relieve tension from the day. You really have to stay on your toes when you play this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game but yall just now deciding to put the app on here when I just went through all the trouble to get it from another appstore
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual Mr. King delivers!  I have been a fan since &#34;The Stand&#34;.  I have read a few I didn't care for as much as others.  But -- a less than stellar read from King is better than most other authors.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wonderful bed time read!  Another thumbs up for Stephen King. I wonder if we will hear more about the True knot!
B00AEBB9V4|4.0|A beautifully, filmed and scripted version of the classic short story by Washington Irving. The special effects help to draw the viewer deeper into the story as it unfolds cryptically and dramatically across the screen. Well worth a viewing during Halloween or any other time one feels the need for a scare.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just like tempel run and free to play I think. So you should get it also and get everything. you can get.GAME ON
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a fun game to play and I love the Halloween update.<br />Avoid all the pumpkins and creepy crypts.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|I put this into a Node 304 with a 660 Ti. Everything works very well. I don't overclock so this processor is perfect for me, plus I got it on sale for $190
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I saw 2001 when it was released in the theatre when I was a boy. It has always been my favourite movie. For years I hope someone would better it. I just watched Gravity in Imax 3D. I must state the difference between the two. 2001 is a fantasy of life and death portrayed in science fiction using futuristic modeling. Gravity looks almost like real (present) science that will make NASA proud. They are a totally different kind of science fiction movie. Fans of 2001 will not need to search for any hidden messages in Gravity. Haven said this, Gravity also had a spiritual moment like 2001 in a final scene (no spoiler intended).<br />If you like REAL space travel , this is the movie for you.<br />Enjoy!
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This has been a great introduction into the learning of a language!  I am so thankful for this opportunity to learn with my children.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer is a challenge to see if you can keep all the coins going in the correct direction. It's like trying to herd a bunch of cats.  You can spend/use a lot of time on this fun game. The price is right also, so that makes it even enjoyable......  :=)<br /><br />In this high tech world, it's fun for us senior citizens to find a game that is relatively simple to play and enjoy too.
B00BEU19ZU|3.0|The time clock for my current location inside the app was 1 hour off from my kindle.  There is obviously a glitch in the software.  I removed it
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is poorly written, perhaps on 6th grade level.  I was half way through and still waiting for something to happen?  Don't bother, I guess they wrote sequels to create the rest of the already boring story.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|The movie was Ok have not seen in 3D yet, kept you on the edge but story a little thin.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting months for this to come out on kindle.  Great gun.....thank you!!  So much better then on my phone.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I like the 3D and wish I could rent 3D but, have to buy this worked out OK got soon after release.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I had to return one of the 2 Settlers of Catan games I bought because it was incomplete.  That was easy and no extra expense - company was great to work with, but the new game that came also had a piece missing... this is an expensive game, so to have 2 out of 3 games missing pieces is a bit disconcerting.  Quality control needs help.<br /><br />Customer service for the company was outstanding - they sent me a new game piece.<br /><br />Game is outstanding... they only fail in their quality control in putting the game together at the factory/manufacturer - that is why the 4 stars instead of 5.
B001974DG0|5.0|This was the very first Koontz book I ever read!  It grabbed me from the first page & didn't stop till the end! If you have never read a Dean Koontz book, I highly recommend you start with this. It will make you a die hard fan. I finally bought it in the Kindle form since I've gone through two paperback books until I started losing pages. Now I don't have to worry anymore since it's on my Kindle Fire HD!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's definitely my favorite game! I play it all the time and it's like the first time every time. Definitely recommended for those that love puzzle games. Beautifully designed and thought out. I can not wait for the Room 2!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|it wont download...I guess I have the old version of the kindle ..... candy crush is my favorite game.... please fix this issue!! or maybe I just need to get an ipad??
B008P1EWIM|5.0|The visuals of the current weather are awesome! Info is accurate also.I really. Like this app. Just purchased but so far so good.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved the way it ended.  The ending reminded me of how complex life is; the importance of forgiveness and how good does come out of bad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I bought minecraft I thought it would be lame. But when I played with my friends,it was awesome.get the app now
B000FC0SIM|5.0|As far as I know On Writing and Danse Macabre are the only two non-fiction works that King has published.Both are great. On Writing is thoughtful and entertaining. You do not need to be an aspiring writer to enjoy it. On Writing is an expanded version of those forwards and afterwords he puts in his short story collections. King writing about his life and the art of storytelling is great stuff.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I would consider this a 'puzzle' game, just a different take on the puzzle.<br />It's very addictive.<br />I've tried some of the other versions of this game on Google Play, but<br />none are good as this.
B0017VT5E8|5.0|won best movie of its year or came in second? i forget. anyway it is. and probably one of the best of all time. the movie makes me cry actually.
0785163174|3.0|WHAT A GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT!!!<br /><br />I used to think Secret Invasion was a wasted opportunity, because I thought the idea of the series was GREAT, but the execution was lacking.  Avengers VS X-Men was an even worst wasted opportunity.<br /><br />Just so you know, this is what I read in preparation for this series:<br /><br />The Dark Phoenix Saga<br />Avengers: Disassembled<br />New Avengers Vol. 1<br />House of M<br />Decimation<br />X-Men: Endangered Species<br />X-Men: Messiah CompleX<br />Uncanny X-Men: The Complete Collection by Matt Fraction - Volume 1<br />Civil War<br />Avengers: The Initiative<br />World War Hulk<br />Mighty Avengers Vol. 1<br />HULK: RED HULK<br />X-Force/Cable: Messiah War<br />Secret Invasion<br />Mighty Avengers Vol. 2: Secret Invasion<br />Dark Avengers<br />Mighty Avengers Vol. 3: Dark Reign!<br />Uncanny X-Men: The Complete Collection by Matt Fraction - Volume 2<br />X-Necrosha<br />X-Men: Second Coming<br />Uncanny X-Men: The Complete Collection by Matt Fraction - Volume 3<br />Siege<br />Fear Itself<br />The Children's Crusade<br />Schism<br />Uncanny X-Men, Vol. 1 [Hardcover]<br />Wolverine and the X-Men, Vol. 1 [Hardcover]<br />Uncanny X-Men, Vol. 2 [Hardcover]<br />Avengers: X-Sanction<br />Avengers vs. X-Men (Ding, ding, ding, ding!!!)<br /><br />So much preparing for this???<br /><br />This is the thing... and you might have some mild spoilers here, so beware... the Avengers VS the REAL X-Men only last for, what?, 2 or 3 issues?  After that is the Avengers VS the Phoenix Force, which by the ay, it supposed to give infinite powers to the carrier (or carriers in this case), but for some reason, Captain America's shield in the head of a Phoenix Force wielder just takes him out of the game for a while.  Geeeeesh!!!  What a bunch of crap!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I was expecting better.  Some good fleshed out story.  Good fleshed out characters.  Good motives to act like they did.  One of the great things of Civil War was the fact that both parts were right.  You actually cared for the reasons of the fight.  You were supposed to choose, but it was difficult because both made sense.  Here?  AVX?  Not so much.<br /><br />Now lets go with the art.  For me at least, it sucked!  I don't know what you guys see in Romita Jr, but he's definably not my cup of tea.  His art resembles to that of Frank Miller's (but with normal feets).  Bodys looks square, and expresions are all lazy.<br /><br />Plus (and this is a deal breaker for me), I still don't understand why the artist can't show a comprehensible death.  I mean, let's get back to Siege.  Remember Ares death???  It was SO graphic that made my skin crawl.  It was right then and there.  No turning back.  He's dead for sure!  In AvX EVERYTHING is confusing!!!  Is the equivalent to the horrific \\"shacky cameras\\" on films.  Nothing is comprehensible with the visuals.  There's a major death in the final issues, but... You can't see it happening.  You just see a white light, and then the \\"body\\" is not shown anymore.  What the hell!!!<br /><br />The only thing it stands here is the ALMOST magnificent edition.  This is a big book and it have a lot of content.  I like that.  Strong pages, great ink, sturdy cover.  Why is not perfect?  Because the book have glued binding.  Epic fail!!<br /><br />My grade is 3 stars.  Most of the credit is given to the edition itself, not the writting nor the art.<br /><br />Recommendation:  Pay $30 or less for this, or wait for the inevitable softcover edition. But beware... there's a sofcover edition called Avengers VS X-Men, but the content is not the same as this book.  Check the content of any book before buying.  You've been warned.ct that both parts were right.  You actually cared for the reasons of the fight.  You were supposed to choose, but it was difficult because both made sense.  Here?  AVX?

B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Just wonderful. .<br />This starts off a bit rough but once you get into the meat of the story, after a bit of a rushed intro, the story just keeps moving. No flat spots. Wonderful tension.<br />Very happy to recommend this to everyone, not just King fans like me.<br />Now I want to know what happens with Abra..
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|Been listening to it often since I received it. She seems to be stretching herself on this latest album.  Looking forward to her next.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|The great thing the new Star Trek movies like is how they can take all of the plots from former Star Trek episodes and make them \\"new.\\"<br /><br />The worst thing we viewers dislike is how the new Star Trek producers take all of the plots from former episodes and regurgitate them.<br /><br />It makes me sick.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Mindless non-stop violence and gore with no discernible plot. Somewhat pornographic. Did we need to see a fantasy of the villain emasculating another bad guy with her teeth? I like sci-fi and comic book adaptations very much.\\"V is for Vendetta\\" is violent but with a good plot. \\"Bladerunner\\" is a classic. Both dark post-apocalyptic stories. Even the Batman movies are pretty good. All of these are dark and violent. But \\"Dredd\\" is just plain dredd-ful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|continuation of his great imaginative writing and storytelling.  I usually refer to him as Stephen wizard.  I think that fits better than plain old king.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the book. My family or I have never been involved in foster care, and I felt it brought to light a lot of information that was<br />very interesting and informative of what children/foster parents go through.  Also, as a gardener, I very much enjoyed the<br />story along with gathering more knowledge of the meanings of flowers.  It opened a whole new world of flowers.  I have already<br />gone to purchase a Victorian flower dictionary!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game but I think you should give more than five live s at a time. I know you can get more from friends but that isn't fast enough. Then if you buy more you only get five!!!!! Come on we spend enough on other games!<br />,,
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was the first Stephen King Book I ever read. I was 12. All these years later, I am a true Constant Reader and have read everything he has written. Starting Dr. Sleep was like picking up the Shining right where it had left off when I was 12. I love the characters and I loved the next chapters in Danny's story. I finished it and I am now re-reading it. Thank you Mr. King. This is one of my new favorites.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game. It's very entertaining to me. My kid's love it. I like that there is alot of different mini game.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|I have been a fan of this amazingly talented band since Ember to Inferno and they have always evolved and gave us something new on each and every album so this masterpiece of modern metal is no different. Yes, David Draiman produced this album and alot of people are pissed and saying that it sounds like Disturbed but honestly Disturbed couldn't pull off the talent displayed on this cd. Trivium is the band that Disturbed wishes they could be. I like Disturbed(old stuff) don't get me wrong, but they fell off a long time ago. I think David Draiman did an amazing job producing this album and he really captured Trivium in their element and I think this is the most complete album since Ascendency. This band has the chops to rule the Metal world and everyone knows it. With this, album, they built off of what they were doing on In Waves, and made the perfect album to please fans old and new. This band has done what few bands have ever done and that is continuously reinvent themselves and keep the music heavy and accessible at the same time. The Disturbed comparisons do not hold merrit with me and I honestly believe that if they would have made the same album with another producer, you people would not be comparing this to Disturbed. That is a ridiculous claim and it falls in the category of anyone saying that just lives to find something to complain about. This album is wonderful and I highly recommend that you give it a shot with an open mind and open ears... Do not let others dictate what you truly feel when you listen to music because some people refuse to be pleased and they are the worst kind of music fans. \m/
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game rocks!I have had this game for 4 months and I can't believe I haven't given up yet! You should totally get this game!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book had a slow start ...but I did enjoy it. It had a few good twists and unexpected ending.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Author links historical evidence in a pattern I've never considered before. I'm. O scholarly enough to evaluate the assertions he makes but the perspective he offers surely deserves a focused conversation .
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this app even better on my kindle than our ipad. Gives a clear forecast, and I like the layout.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Overpriced./ Difficult to use. Don't waste your money.Setup is awkward and has limited reach.If you are looking for access to Netflix on your TV there are much better ways get there.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I heard lots of good things about this book's movie, but, not having much money, opted to read the book first.  I really liked it.  I liked how it took a mentally ill man and went inside how he thinks and processes things.  As someone living with severe mental illness, I could relate to some things, but mainly, since I struggle with very different issues, it was just interesting.  However, although I admittedly haven't checked out if the author was involved in the filming of the movie, I wonder what he would have thought of it.  To me, the author's constant use of the phrase \\"the bad place\\" without ever mentioning that it's a mental facility and \\"apart time\\" for his 'temporary' separation from his wife Nikki, suggests to me that he was trying to convey that not only is Pat mentally ill, but that he may also have a minor developmental disability.  He talks a lot like a child, and doesn't seem bothered that his Mom manages most of his life.  However, being severely ill myself at times, but never to the point that I was put in a facility for many years, I could imagine that being THAT ill, you may come out needing that type of support for a time.  However, the language the author chooses for Pat to use, just doesn't make sense for someone without a developmental disability to me.  However, if the author did not intend to imply that Pat also has a developmental disability, then I think he took the idea to convey mental illness without actually ever mentioning a bit too far.  Those phrases are VERY child-like.  He could have easily used \\"adult\\" words and just not given us Pat's diagnosis, etc to convey mental illness is a more general sense and I think it would have worked better.<br /><br />This book is heart-warming.  It has great character development up to the last page of the book.  There is plenty going on to keep the story going.  However, I did have to take all the child like talk from Pat and, instead of get irritated by it, realize that the author is using it intentionally to indirectly tell me something about Pat.  That helped me a lot.  Instead of getting irritated, I just thought, \\"wow, this guy is really struggling\\".  Luckily, the other characters talk like adults.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book is that I could see it being EXTREMELY triggering for someone with an eating disorder and/or a compulsive exercising disorder.  I get that the author wanted to drive home all of Pat's problems and how severe they are, but the fact that his therapist and his family and friends never mention or address the issue, even once, is concerning to me.  Honestly, they should have been working with him on that in the bad place to start.  In fact, I think it's very sick that his Mom buys him a workout watch for Christmas.  But again, this story didn't write itself, and I can only assume the author was trying to make a point.  I have friends with eating disorders and struggle with Bingeing myself.  I assume the author was pointing out how ignorant our culture can be to eating disorders.  They do usually go undetected for a while before someone starts to even suspect.  Moreover, in this book, I think the point is that too often, we as a culture are so obsessed with \\"looking great\\", that we forget about getting there in a healthy manner.  Encouraging Pat to exercise 12 hours a day, letting him wear plastic bags running, letting him spend his nights sweating in the attic with the fans off, etc is where I have a problem with this book.  These are all very unusual and extreme behaviors that anyone in their right mind should have been at least trying to help him cut down and stop.  Usually, people with these sorts of problems hide their behaviors.  The only one he tries to hide is sleeping in the attic to sweat all night. But, after his parents find him there, nothing is done and he continues the behavior.  As someone who doesn't and has not ever struggled with these sorts of problems, I can read about them and how the other characters encouraged them and not get triggered (although because I'm sensitive to the issue, I do get angry), but someone who is, or has struggled with these or similar issues could be in for some REALLY triggering pages in this book.<br /><br />Overall, this book confuses me as far as the author's intent.  On one hand, he seems to be giving his audience an inside view on mental illness, but on the other, he doesn't seem to understand what happens, how others react, and the treatment for severe harmful behaviors associated with mental illness.  He obviously doesn't have a mental illness himself (or if he does, took creative license to make the story work better) since Pat's Therapist is also his Psychiatrist.<br /><br />However, I LOVED reading it!  All the issues I described did not get in my way of enjoying this book as a novel.  In fact, I thought parts of it were hilarious - some because I have an inside view of mental illness, and some because they are just generally funny.  Well, a lot of it was funny.  It was also sad.  It's a great read!  Just don't expect a picture perfect view of what it's like to have a mental illness since the author skips over some very major parts of the treatments and peoples reactions.<br /><br />The movie, on the other hand is also great (although I think the book wins in my opinion).  But it is absolutely NOTHING like the book!  Major plot element in the book are out of place or dramatically changed for cinematic effect (for example, one thing that Pat doesn't know until the end of the book, he has memory of from the beginning of the movie!).  I can see why they chose to change things since the book would really not make a good movie without most of these changes.  But, about 5 minutes in, I had to just put my thoughts about how the book goes on hold and enjoy the movie for what it is, since everything is so totally rearranged or changed.  In fact, this almost made the book and movie better, since afterwards I could laugh at how completely unrelated they were!  My biggest problem with the movie was that Pat seemed to have no developmental issues in the movie, which was a huge shock to me!<br /><br />So in a nutshell:  This book is well worth the read, it's got all the right elements and interest for a great read.  Just bear in mind it's not perfect in representing mental illness, it's a novel after all.  If you've already seen the movie, enjoy the book for it's own enjoyment, you will be surprised at how different it is!  If you haven't watched the movie, I honestly think it's better to start with the book first, as it will help you understand some of the unspoken things in the movie.  It's a very quick read.  I think it took me 2 or 3 days, and no, I didn't spend all day reading!  It's a short book.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Note: I'd love to hear about other people's opinions on some of the issues I addressed here.
0060512806|2.0|I got this book as a gift from a friend who was very enthusiastic about it.  I'm only on page 131 (of 1,152 in the paperback) and while the concurrent stories are somewhat compelling, the writing style is quite distracting to say the least.  Stephenson spends way too much time describing scenes, and apparently he thinks every new noun and verb must be described by a colorful (or absurd) simile.  It feels like he's a straight-A high school student trying to impress his English teacher.<br /><br />The following is a passage from page 123: &quot;As Randy and Avi enter a great flurry of hand-shaking and card-presenting ensues, though most of the introductions zoom through Randy's short-term memory like a supersonic fighter blowing past shoddy Third World air defense systems.  He is left only with a stack of business cards.  He deals them out on his patch of table like a senescent codger playing Klondike on his meal tray.&quot;<br /><br />I hate to not finish a book that I've started, but it's awfully hard to read when you're constantly rolling your eyes.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I actually read this when it was included in a package of other books & loved it... Rose is so funny but completely relate-able...
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|Mayer has clearly evolved as an artist since the more pop style early days, and Paradise Valley and Born and Raised both provide evidence of this evolution. I enjoy listening to this album as much as I do the earlier albums. Mayer's songwriting skills and ability to cross musical genres shines through on Paradise Valley.
B00821OX98|5.0|Best show ever! I could not stop watching till I saw every episode. I Can't wait for the next season.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Feels like old times... I couldn't put this down. This was King at his very best and so satisfying if, I presume, you read The Shining. Completes the loop and completely an enjoyable read.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I just updated and now I get an internal error message and the game will not load...super frustrating especially when I have items to hatch and move from incubation.
B00338QENI|4.0|Who could imagine a nonfiction book about science be so intriguing?  Thanks to my book club for having this on the list.  The stories of the tobacco farming ring true to the stories of my grandparents who were also tobacco farmers in the same region.  &#34;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&#34; should be required reading for those in the science and medical fields.  I would also propose it for civic classes as a case study of how bad things are allowed to happen to people in the name of advancement.  It was not just the Nazis who were capable of doing immoral research on its own people.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|This movie wasnt too bad overall. Will Smith was probably overkill considering the small contribution he had in the film. He certainly has done better job at more serious rolls ( i.e.  I am Legend / 7 Pounds).<br /><br />Jaden Smith didnt really seem up to the task to be the primary role in this film which was kind of surprising given his pedigree and how well he did in Karate Kid.<br /><br />As other have stated, the basis of the story was pretty weak sauce. Did liberals ban all advanced weaponry or what? Lol. I dont want to give the story away so I wont give anymore details about that.  Will Smith is in over his head as a sci-fi writer. M. Night Shyamalan actually did OK this time around given his ability to make his next movie worse than the previous one.<br /><br />Overall it was worth a rent though. If nothing else looks good at your local movie rental kiosk, this should do.
0399230033|5.0|We were looking for &#34;goodnight&#34; books for our two year old so we bought a few. This was an instant hit and he wanted to read over and over. He still likes it a month later which is ages in toddler years.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|I believe this movie does a wonderful job of comparing being born and dying, and with the way Benjamin ages backwards, you can't help but ponder how we are essentially the same at the start and end of life.<br /><br />The technical aspects of this movie were very well done, as well. The music and cinematography were beautiful, and the aging/ anti-aging makeup for Brad Pitt was flawless.<br /><br />Very well done, and it is worth watching.
0817439390|5.0|Have learnt so much from the book.<br />It's nice knowing that anything I need is in this book. The way things are explained are clear and concise.<br /><br />My only gripe is that most of these pages are available online.<br /><br />But none-the-less, a worthy book to have in the collection.
B00C9G22R2|5.0|This movie about IP man was beautiful and artistic.I found the life of IP man to be very interesting. Like all Chinese movies there is always some tragedy that takes place in the characters lives. This tragedy is true.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great game with hours of fun, easy to play and reasonably priced, and delivered timely, it will make a great gift or asset.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|I avoided seeing this in the theaters, expecting a sub-par Ice Age clone. My sister took her kids to see it and recommended it highly, but I still decided to wait. Well it finally released on Amazon Instant and I thought I'd finally give it a shot. It was definitely funny, and my family and I were laughing throughout. Nicholas Cage can be hit or miss with me, but he excels as the father role and had me, as a father myself,  understanding the difficulty of watching your kid grow up and developing independence. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with children or someone who enjoys animated features.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Good quality nice game with a price that can't be beat, it makes a great gift or addition to my personal game collection.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|Frank Darabont is an exceptional director, particularly when it comes to adapting Stephen King stories. He adds depths to characters that not many other directors could ( Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile) and here he takes on the 100 page novella &#34;The Mist&#34;. This movie is good - the effects are occasionally too CGI for my liking, but still do not detract from the main story. Darabont has a habit of using a lot of actors throughout his projects, and with good reason, so there are familiar faces to be seen. I DID have a problem with the ending, although I won't ruin it here for anyone having not seen it. Overall, I found this feature to be not quite up to the standard he previously set, but still a worthwhile experience.
B00C1S945G|5.0|I watched this in college.  It brings back a lot of memories.  I can't believe it's been out this long!  What's not to like about this series?  It's got Klingons, the Borg, and my fav Q!
1568363931|5.0|Luv this book it has alot of easy recipes to make. I made a couple for the little girls i babysit and they loved them.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This Demo is great but I hate that it only lets you play for one day and then you have to start over.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book was a powerful statement about life after life on earth. Anyone who has doubts about a soul should read this book. It was well written and believeable.
B005K17RU0|2.0|It works, but it is slow, cumbersome and not very intuitive.  I find this especially true when using it on my Kindle.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not my favorite and would not have read it had it not been suggested by a friend. It was &#34;okay&#34;, but not my kind of book.<br />I did finish it, but thought about stopping in the middle.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Luckily, I had just read The Shining again recently which set me up to read this one.  I don't know how the guy does it, but it is a great read and ties-in well to the originally story.  It is hard to put down, which is typical of King.  Perhaps we will someday read about what Abra's future holds?
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I can't spot any digital manipulation.  The 70mm aerial shots are breathtaking.  Shadow tones are as I would expect on film.  Details in the church are clear, but not artificially so.  Screen ratio is correct.  I was only using stereo TV speakers, but the sound is far clearer than the usual hifi VHS and the audio cassettes of my childhood.  In fact, because of the truer sound, I found myself enthralled by slower scenes which have zonked me out in the past.  For instance, when the Captain plays Edelweiss, and that guitar strum softly lulls you to sleep, or when Gretel sings, &#34;The sun...has gonnne...to bed and so must IIIII...&#34;-- these scenes used to put me to sleep with the soft background hiss.  Now I stay focused on the words of Edelweiss.  It's actually quite a moving tribute to a nation under seige and it brought a tear to my eye.  As Gretel is carried up the steps, I can hang in there for the grownup drama to follow.  Picture so close to the original it may bring a tear to your eye, sound so close to the original it may rekindle your childhood love for the music.  Plus, being a combo pack, you've got a loaner DVD for parents and kids who tend to borrow movies and not return them.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|This is a really great family movie and my kids (both the older and the younger ones) enjoyed it. need more family movies:)
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Written to support a non-supportable viewpoint. Pick and choose scripture and call other scripture that does not not support his viewpoint as fabricated and fiction. Seriously poor scholar approach.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Very short.  Fairly easy.  Not too bad for what it is.  But I've played better &#34;Escape&#34; games on the web.
B00F880BWG|4.0|I hope the show has some sort of conclusion this season. Just hanging out at the farm for a entire season killing zombies was cool. Then an entire season of hanging out at the prison killing zombies was okay, but if it is just more of that then they might lose me as a viewer. Let it be some sort of conclusion and don't drag it out just because.
B002JVWR0Y|3.0|Several episodes would not play. Rather disappointing when we had to skip over the sequence of story line.<br />Will try again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have his complete library, always enjoy his books. Ne never fails to get me intereseted in the story line.
0449911357|4.0|I have read the story half a dozen times at least and enjoyed it every time. The original story was a short story in a book of short stories by Flagg and had a few plots that are missing from the story as presented to the public now. It's been &#34;sanitized&#34; by omission of some plots that were in the original, written long before any movie script was contemplated. The movie was also sanitized, but if you had never read the original short story, you wouldn't know that anything was different. The story is a masterpiece and I never tire of reading it.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Star Trek - Into the Darkness is mainly a fast paced action film interspersed with scenes of human interest which facilitates the deeper development of the main characters and their inter-relationships. The phrase 'bonding under fire seems appropriate. I would urge people not to be dissuaded from watching this film because a reviewer cannot see the link between Gene Roddenberry's much vaunted ideals and therefore trashes J.J. Abrams work. Star Trek - Into the Darkness is aptly named. It is rich in plot detail and exciting to watch. It will have many people sitting on the edge of their seats. It is a must see for those who enjoy Star Trek, for those who don't, you need to watch it yourself to make up your own mind. Don't let the reviews keep you from watching this film. Tons of action.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This just gets better and better.  We watch it every year so it has become a tradition. And we love it
0767817478|5.0|This is an all out action movie that deserves way better reviews than it got. The characters work together well for a movie of this type. Rather than make Godzilla a giant monster, they gave the creature a personality with its behaviour, a personality that can best be seen at the Madison Square Garden explosion. Add to this the great acting, and the &#34;scientific&#34; explanations and this is a grossly under-rated movie.
0596005903|4.0|A perfect resource for writing Linux drivers.  I am an experience programmer, but never had written a device driver.  This book has everything a programmer needs to write Linux device drivers.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers. It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat, if we listen. Worth your time and money.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I recommend Tiny Thief.<br /><br />The game is cute, but I doubt I'll play it much myself.  It seems more suited for a younger audience.  When my granddaughter is old enough, she will undoubtedly get a kick out of it.  It does require some thought at higher levels, though.<br /><br />What bothers me is that Rovio claims the game is appropriate for users of all ages, but in their EULA, they state the app may link to WEB Sites that are not appropriate for children under the age of 13.  As far as I know, this is applicable to all of their apps.  If you install the game, you should take appropriate steps to protect younger players.<br /><br />To get an idea what apps collect and do with that information, try to get in the habit of reading EULAs.  For example, Rovio states:<br /><br />&bull; Please note that certain features of the Services may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you.<br />&bull; Personal data may be disclosed to third parties in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />Know your apps!<br /><br />But, it's not as bad as it may seem because, Tiny Thief works without internet access, at least after the license verification.<br /><br />The permission for this app are quite acceptable (after you block internet access, if you are as private as I am) and well worth the download.<br /><br />I generally never install non-board type 2D games, but I decided to give this one a try and I'm glad I did.  Try it for yourself or your kids.  As the FAotD, it's a bargain; at its regular prices, I think it's worth the price Rovio has set.<br /><br />Have fun!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I find that once I start playing it I don't want to stop.  Everything about it is so cute and realistic. The announcers are great.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not as terrifying as The Shining, but definitely a page turner! Loved it! Makes you unsure of who really may be on the same highway or rest stop on a long road trip!
B00C32R64G|5.0|Best rock album in a long time if you like the Volbeat sound...personally, I think every song on this album absolutely rocks!
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|good music performed by a great group of performers.  some songs are not as good as others but the good songs make up for the bad.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have always been a fan of candy crush saga...it's on my android and when I'm at work I play it on my laptop.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is a must read!  Cannot wait for the movie to come out.  I'm sure it will not be nearly as good as the books though.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was a good book but I kept getting distracted and took forever to finish it but I was glad I read it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.  I read it all in one night.  I can not wait for the movie to come out.  I hope its good too
B000FC11JW|5.0|A fantastic read about how you can change your perception as well as take very simple steps to improve the value you bring to your organization and vice versa.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I truly believe that this artist can lift the world with the sound of love, passion, and liberty.  If you would enjoy hearing greatness to it's fullest extent here it is all on one disc.  Enjoy!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ive been waiting for this app for ages!! Its a fantastic time killer and brain exercise. Highly recommended for anyone and everyone! (:
B003PIS5XI|4.0|A great flick for all ages.  Very positive and not too violent.  Not too long and even a bit inspirational.
1451695195|5.0|I loved this book. It was well written. I expected it to be a challenging read (since the author is a brain surgeon), I was pleasantly surprised. I think most Christians wonder what Heaven could be like. This book gives one brief example.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|great cast,  great writing. still going strong in season 6.  my only wish here denied? I wish they would've had a bonus feature around the &#34;Flash dance&#34; that Kaley and her sister Brie instigated.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I was only looking for a case for this and i didnt read too much into this.<br /><br />Apparently theres a charge that this case holds which if you charge for 90 minutes you can slap your voyager in it to charge without a wire.<br /><br />Pretty slick holder + extended battery charge.
B00D2I8E46|4.0|When you see The Roots on the cover of an album, it’s hard not to let your expectations get the best of you. The legendary Hip Hop crew have worked hard to progress the genre for over fifteen years and each album saw them grow both lyrically and musically. Recent years have seen them collaborating with musicians outside of their core group and it doesn’t seem like they’re stopping anytime soon. Following 2010’s Wake Up! with John Legend and 2011’s Betty Wright: The Movie with Betty Wright, the Philadelphia boys have returned with their third collaborative album, Wise Up Ghost with Elvis Costello.<br /><br />I’ll admit, I didn’t pay much attention to Wake Up! because I’m not a fan of John Legend, and I didn’t know they did an album with Betty Wright until a few weeks ago. I did listen to a few songs from Wake Up!, but it didn’t grab me the way I wanted it to so I wound up skipping the release entirely. You see, my main problem with these albums is the lack of Black Thought. In my opinion, The Roots without Black Thought is like a hot dog without ketchup, or pizza without pepperoni. Sure, it may be good, but it’s far from great. Black Thought is the final piece to the complex puzzle that is The Roots and without him the group is incomplete.<br /><br />With that said, though, I had high hopes for Wise Up Ghost. Which is surprising given the fact that I’m unfamiliar with Elvis Costello’s past work. When I listened to “Walk Us Uptown” for the first time I was pleasantly surprised with what I heard. The instrumentation was catchy and I found Costello’s vocals to be unusually addictive. They weren’t fantastic or ground-breaking, but they fit quite nicely over The Roots’ production. They were two separate elements that merged together really well to form something different, yet familiar.<br /><br />Truthfully, that’s kind of how the entire album is. The Roots provide the attention grabbing instrumentation and Costello goes off and doeshis thing. Unfortunately, Wise Up Ghost doesn’t do too much to deviate from its core sound. Each song sounds unbearably similar to those that precede it and this allows the album to border on monotonous. I’m all for consistency, but there needs to be some variety from one song to the next. Otherwise it becomes difficult to differentiate the songs from one another.<br /><br />Still, it would be wrong to write the album off completely. There were a few instances where both parties actually branched out and tried something new. The most obvious example would be track nine, “Cinco Minutos Con Vos.” The song is a duet with Latin vocalist La Marisoul and it’s probably one of the most unique songs on the entire album. Costello and Marisoul go back and fourth with their individual verses before coming together to finish the song off as a unit. I was actually surprised at how enjoyable it was and how well it fit within the album itself.<br /><br />Finally, one of my biggest issues with Wise Up Ghost is that too few of these songs actually excel past “enjoyable.” I didn’t hate any song on the album, and I enjoyed the three bonus songs, but majority of these offerings rest on the cusp between “good” and “great”. Unfortunately, it’s mostly due to Costello himself. For example, at times, Costello’s lyrics left me scratching my head in wonder. Now I’ve heard some weird lyrics this year, but some of the things he said on here were very, very odd. Also, there were more than a few instances where you actually heard his voice crack and it left me wondering why he didn’t just re-record that section of the song. It’s these little things that really pile up and bring down the experience.<br /><br />Standout Songs: &#34;Come the Meantimes&#34; & &#34;(She Might Be a) Grenade&#34;<br /><br />Overall Score: 7.8/10 - Look, I really enjoyed Wise Up Ghost. The Roots provided some really amazing production and, for the most part, Costello provided some nice vocals. Unfortunately, the album suffers from what I like to call over-consistency and Costello definitely could have polished his lyrics and vocal delivery a little bit. Still, overall it’s an enjoyable experience and I’m glad I took the time to check it out. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it given my unfamiliarity with Costello.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Outstanding! The best so far. I would even have paid for it. I Highly recommend this app for those who travel  a lot.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and it got here very quickly.  /There were no problems with the performance of the movie.  I did find the movie to be a little gloomy but all in all, I enjoyed it.
B00EP0KYDO|4.0|The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it really only has two characters throughout the entire movie. The effects were great and Will and Jayden Smith are always great together.
0792160347|2.0|I can't figure out why people--guys especially--seem to hate Richard Gere so much. I don't think he's the greatest actor of his generation or anything, and photographed from the wrong angle, he can look kind of creepy, especially when he was younger. (He has aged gracefully IMO.) But when cast within his range, he's capable, charismatic and attractive, and he seems able to laugh at himself. So really, I don't get the hate and I didn't dislike \\"American Gigolo\\" because of Richard Gere.<br /><br />Rather, I disliked \\"American Gigolo,\\" because it kept too much of a distance from its characters and its themes for the audience to engage with them. I had just read Joan Didion's \\"Play It As It Lays,\\" another indictment of the superficiality, materialism and spiritual deadness of affluent Southern California. That book was brilliant because its hard surfaces were fragile and you could reach in and touch its narrator's anguish. While writer-director Paul Schrader has done some great work (\\"Taxi Driver\\" for instance), this story of Julian Kaye,  who sleeps with wealthy older women for money and gets caught in a web of suspicion after a client is murdered, never lets the viewer in deep enough to feel anything. You get subtle hints of Julian's malaise. He has stacks of pictures in his apartment that he flips through but never hangs on the wall. He expresses frustration that he can't do work other than be a male escort, but that doesn't even make sense because he shows a remarkable aptitude for learning languages. We know nothing of where he's from, what dreams he may have brought with him, or how or why he became what he is. Maybe his problem is that his ambition was misdirected in the first place and he thought having material stuff was all he would need to be fulfilled, but we never find out. He seems to have little in common, other than loneliness and physical attraction, with Michelle, the wife of an ambitious politician with whom he has an unpaid relationship (Lauren Hutton), so her enduring devotion to him and belief in his goodness doesn't make a lot of sense either.<br /><br />Maybe the movie would have worked better with Julie Christie playing Michelle (she was in talks at one point), but I doubt it. I don't think the script would have given even the most gifted actors enough to work with. Schrader's analysis is fine, giving \\"American Gigolo the potential to have been an excellent movie, but his directorial and scriptwriting choices left me cold.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a wonderful glimpse into a little know piece of history. The Orphan train of the early 1900's is an event that changed our country in ways most of us never imagined. This book is well written and gives you a small picture of the ripple effect of our history.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|As expected, this CD is wonderful.  Love every song on it.  Very interesting to have the companion CD with the songs sung by other artists, but they don't sound as good as Gov't Mule IMO, with the exception of Grace Potter.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|It had been a long time since I saw the movie, and thought it was time to finally read the book.  I'm glad I did.  The book fleshed out much of what was unclear in the movie, but made me want to view the film again.  Rather than try to describe the story, I'll just say read it, see the film, and discuss with your friends!

B00C2C637I|5.0|I have been a fan of the movie of this book for quite some time and was eager to finally read the source material.  It's a rare book that made at least as good a movie.  As with any good sci-fi or fantasy, it's really not focused too much ont eh fantastic elements, but on the human reactions to those elements.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Great book, it makes you think about the way you are living your life and what are your goals.<br /> How connected are we to the earth to the One Who created us all?
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this book fascinating and maddening.  The story of Tesla is one of great triumph and great betrayal.  We in the modern era owe more than most of us know to this extraordinary genius who seemed to be betrayed at every moment of success.
B008220D5K|4.0|First of all, Leslie Mann is a great comedic actress. One of the best in the business. Maybe in this instance, too much so. Her character in this movie is too much of a nagging shrew to find the least bit sympathetic. I kept yelling at Paul Rudd to get the heck out of there. I honestly think her deepest desire is to castrate her husband and then live out some faux lesbian relationship with him. The movie has some hysterical moments, however, hence my three-star review. If I didn't like Leslie Mann as an actress, though, my feelings toward her from here on out would be decidedly negative.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app and free  Fun for relaxing, besting your best, playing others on line.  I love it for just taking a short break during the day.  Had one problem with program but simply deleted it and reinstalled and  chalk it up to something I did.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love, and am addicted to, Stephen King. I eagerly await each and every book he writes.  I must admit, though, that this is one of his BEST novels.  Perhaps I can attribute this to the fact that The Shining is a classic in my eyes.  Doctor Sleep did not disappoint.  Following Danny Torrance through a troubled adulthood was thought provoking and discovering the refreshing new talent of Abra Stone was exciting! As per usual, I became totally sad and depressed when I reached the last chapter because it was over.  If Stephen could only produce at a faster rate!  A must read!

B008EKMB82|3.0|The plot of this novel concerns two families:  one in Japan and one in British Columbia.  The story in Tokyo is about a tragic situation that leads the father and daughter (Nao) to contemplate suicide.  The story in BC is about Ruth and Oliver who are struggling with their relationship on lonely Desolation Island.  Ruth, a novelist, has a problem with writer's block and for the last ten years has been trying to write a memoir.<br /><br />That's not all by any means.  The story in Japan is an introduction to Zen practice and custom, temple names, kamikaze diaries, dharma, Marcel Proust, French poetry, moral buffers in human/computer interface design, quantum mechanics (which is time being, as is classical physics), and Schrodinger's cat, just to mention a few.<br /><br />The BC couple does a lot of bickering, often times because of the differences in their interests, magnified when Ruth finds some curious debris in a plastic bag on the coastal sand near her home.  Oliver wants her to throw it away, but Ruth thinks it may be like a message in a bottle and looks at the contents.  One of the items is a diary seemingly written by a young woman but without any dates.<br /><br />The flotsam gives Oliver, a Pacific Rim ecologist, an opportunity to explain the eleven great planetary gyres.  After a chapter discussion about the Pacific gyres, currents and their orbital periods, he concludes that the artifacts may the leading edge of drift from the tsunami in Japan.  Reading the diary to Oliver leads to his explaining many more ecological conditions to Ruth, but she, of Japanese descent herself, is more interested in making a connection with the writer of the diary and her family in Japan.<br /><br />The part about the Japanese family was my interest in the novel.  Too much was attempted by adding another plot and then making a chapter by chapter comparison.<br />There are so many complex scientific and philosophical ideas explained in depth that  the plot is overwhelmed.  \\"A Tale for the Time Being\\" is just the opposite.Tale for the Time Being\\" is just the opposite.
B009ME47H2|1.0|I loaded the free version which I had used for quite a while on my Android phone and I was very disappointed.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|not really sure how I felt about the story or even how to review it. it wasn't a crazy passionate story, a really sad story, or a crazy love story...but in a way....it was. It is so hard to describe how I felt about it. I really liked it but there were so much emotional turmoil for the reader that it was draining.  Regardless, I couldn't get enough and can't wait to read more of their story. So...apparently Colleen Hoover knows how to write a good book.<br /><br />I received this arc from netgalley for an honest review.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I liked it. Seems like it follows life in the way that everything happens for a reason and this is what Danny was destined to do to help someone else like someone helped him when he was young.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Intense would be a good word to describe this story. some of it was tough to read...and by that I mean emotional and disturbing, but it was truly endearing and full of love at the heart of it.  everyone should have someone they can always count on....<br /><br />I received this arc from net galley for an honest review.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Well designed. Kept me engaged and waiting for more. Can't wait for more rooms. Highly recommend this app. Good luck.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I grew up on all the old Disney movies, loving every one of them.  So when this movie came out I was already well into adulthood and I was skeptical about them messing with there reputation for great movie animation and the creation of Disney heroines.  But I like everyone else fell in love with this moving and I put it in among all the other Disney classic fills such as Snow White, Cinderella, Peter Pan, Alice In Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.
B007P2DQJI|5.0|In local markets I would get this battery for triple the price. Be aware though that this battery does not fit every model, you have to check your phone in order to be sure and don't buy a wrong battery model. With the old battery, after a year of use, was giving me a very short live, I would have to recharge the phone every 6 hours or so. Now I'm back to &#34;normal&#34; and I only need to recharge my phone once every 20~24 hours.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|all the two sets is good,shipping is fast.will buy next time.my son very like it .thank you hope the price lower
B0001ARCFA|5.0|VERY GOOD PRODUCT
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great entertainment with plenty of twists, turns and intreige to keep you coming back for the next chapter. Oh what a life they lived.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun, and totally addicting. Not to mention the fact that the minions are absolutely hilarious! And every time I start to get bored with it, they add new stuff. I seriously play this game way too much, lol.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Quite Interesting and enlightening<br /> A little too descriptive and detailed.  I really enjoyed the biblical references and the surprise towards the end. I did not see that coming
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Worked like a charm for our particular application. Good all around range of adjustments. A great set-and-forget solution where you may only need on the fly (i.e. buttonless and toolless) horizontal adjustment. If the cable bulk (number or size) coming off of your display is a bit large, you may need to enhance the nylon cable guides with additional tie downs. The dual mount option was very helpful.<br /><br />If you need rapid and frequent on the fly horizontal and vertical and/or twist adjustment, you may want to review one of Neo-Flex's other great products like the LX.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|AMAZING!! It was so hard to put it down!!<br />Great plot, characters, setting, order, and most of all great details. It's had the perfect amount so you could tell exactly what was going on at all times! Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|VERY HAPPY TODAY I LOVE THIS GAME NOW ONLY IF WE CAN GET &#34;INSTAGRAM&#34; MAYBE AM ASKING TO MUCH BUT IT CAN HAPPEN LET'S MAKE IT POSSIBLE AMAZON.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like this game. It has tons of things to play alongside the missions. The best part is it's free. This game will keep you busy for a long time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Works like a calculator. Very nice too have easy access I'm always misplacing the house calculator and this one I never lose.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Enjoyed every piece of text. Getting lost in time and the energy of the circus was a great treat. Absolutely a wonderful read for October book club
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!! it is also really addictive. this game is way better than temple run because you can get mire things and u dont die as easly. BEST GAME EVER!!! GET IT!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|was a blast from the start . once you get going its hardcto stop.  And playing it on my kindle is easy
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I play this game on my computer at lunch at work and enjoy being be able to play on my kindle.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This was my first purchase from MusicShop780, and I am so excited that it came sooner than I expected. The only problem is that the case was broken on the inside—the prongs in the center were all broken off, but they offered a partial refund with the CD, since the broken case was not their fault but the fault of those who handled it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|cant get it off the loading page. it keeps loading and stays on 0% the hole time while all this wierd stuff pops up at the bottom of loading screen
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|I just bought the mp3 album and I can't stop listening to it. I like all the songs but my favorite ones are lay myself down, I've gotta stop, and common burn. I have listened to Mazzy Star since I was in Highschool  and have all the albums including the warm inventions they're my favorite band.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is an Excellent novel I  just wish it was longer i  was sad to close this book for sure
0143034901|5.0|Shadow of the Wind is the first book of an adventure that you will never forget.  If you have visited Barcelona<br />you will relive every step of your trip.  I am reading it the second time for book club.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|The SFX of this movie are amazing. At several moments I thought to myself &#34;they must have filmed in space or how did they do that?&#34; Story was great. The actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are amazing.<br /><br />If you can watch in IMAX 3D ( I believe it was made for IMAX) it is worth the price if you do not have an IMAX theaters near by try at least watching in 3D is an amazing experience.<br /><br />The director did a great job keeping everything realistic, even the use of sound in space (no sound) and inside the astronaut suit very cool<br /><br />Overall is a must see Movie.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|A morality tale written from the point of view of a dog. A fun beach read, but nothing life changing... There are &#34;good&#34; characters who have bad things befall them, &#34;bad&#34; characters who are really more like caricatures and get what is coming to them in the end and one morally complex character who gets so little page time that we barely get to know anything about her. Plot is like a formulaic Hollywood movie: fun while you're reading, you get the ending you're rooting for, but ultimately, meh.<br /><br />If you're looking for something complex or realistic that gives you a deeper understanding of human nature or the world, this is NOT that book. If you're just looking for something entertaining by a writer with a MUCH better command of language and writing than most mass market writers, then pick this up.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I'm not going to ruin it for you!  Just read it and enjoy!  I couldn't put in down!  It's books like this that make me miss time in bed :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's difficult to review this book without spoilers, but I enjoyed it very much. I think Stephen King is in his best form here.  It helps to re-read The Shining before you read this book, especially if you're more familiar with the movie than the book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's been a while since Steven King has written a novel that is near impossible to put down...this is a winner.
B00EUS9JF0|1.0|Love Macca...but found this CD painful to listen to.  Boring, mostly lifeless...not worth a second listen.  I was so turned off by Kisses on the Bottom...couldn't wait for the new stuff...just plain disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Same old stuff...same old cheesy dialogue however, brace yourself because this time, these two are really in love and gush about it constantly. It's also long for a romance novel.  I would have been ok ending at Part 2 but I guess you need to see how it ends.  Overall, I give this one an \\"Eh.\\"  Also, I'm happy to be done with them all because now I can say that I have.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app on my Samsung Galaxy Tab2.  I own a Kindle Fire and Kindle Paperwhite.  I'm able to access books on Amazon cloud.  Love the ability to sync to latest page that was read on Kindle device and vice versa.  Definately a must have app for anyone with android tablet and Kindle device.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really loved this book!  It's a page-turner.  Of course, had read the Shining and this book really ties it in.  If I had time, I could've finished it in one day!! Love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to this game and thrilled to death that I can finally play it on my Kindle Fire HD! The graphics on my Fire are awesome! Now if I can just figure out a way to get unlimited lives....
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This was a good movie.  Suspend your disbelief and enjoy.  It's more focused on the story and less on trying to scare you with zombie effects.  It's not going to tax your intellect or anything.  But definitely worth a rental on an otherwise lazy afternoon/evening.
B008EL25LE|1.0|I actually loved the graphics and the match 3 was interesting but I should have paid more attention to the reviewer who commented on the headache received from playing this.  The lightening is wicked and after only 5 minutes of continual flashes, half my head was threatening some seriously bad times ahead. I had to stop and delete the game from my kindle...there is no way to shut off the lightening so this game is a no go... for me anyway.
0470474874|5.0|I know very little about Excel.  It starts from a level of someone who knows nothings, gives great tips that will make you an expert, has practices, a CD.  I just love it.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be great a Excel.  Mr. Walkenbach explains things very simply.  This book is a must have.  They gave us an Excel help book at work from someone they hired to teach us a class.  The book was horrible.  I couldn't benefit from it.  Don't know how much they paid that women, but it was truly a waste of their money.  We would have been better with this Excel 2010 Bible.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like it because u can go to space and drive crazy things awesome places and cars try this game
B00F9040HU|2.0|There is only limited free play and then you are required to buy it.  It should be &#34;Trial&#34; not &#34;Free
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am not an emotional person but I truly enjoyed thus book. It was very honest and heartfelt. A great read that I would suggest to everyone.
1401938906|5.0|I love this book!  Things are happening - it's great, light, dry, brilliant humor on an otherwise thick, laborious topic.  Pam keeps it simple - your thoughts create your reality.  Like she says, you don't have to put aside your skepticism forever, just for 48 hours while you try out the experiments.  What do you have to lose? I only gained, manifested, created, and received! yess! I just bought 10 to hand out to my health coaching clients. :)
B008A5H78K|4.0|I have the LP but it has wear and I wanted to hear this on the road.  It isn't their best but it is doggone good to hear again.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|The only saving grace for this movie was that because they showed nothing of Asgard.  The movies have done justice to most of the avengers but Thor really got the shaft in his solo movie.  Fortunately the director ignored almost everything from the previous movie and brought back more mythology.  Unfortunately that is where my compliments end.  Hawkeye was terrible, the skrull were a train wreck and a the plot was tissue paper thin.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love Sarah McLachlan as I have 6 of her CD's.  I bought this one primarily for &#34;The Answer&#34;.  I saw about the last hour of a Jodi Foster movie about a hero vigilante and this was played as the credit rolled.  I'm an old coot but I get misty eyed when I listed to it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought for free this game wouldn't be that involved. I was wrong. I love strategy games and this one will give your brain a bit of a workout. My kids happened to be watching and next thing I knew we were all playing it and having a great time. It was wonderful quality time which is hard to come by these days. Thank you so much.
B000MCIBE8|4.0|The vinyl is getting too worn and I wanted something to hear on the road.  This fits the bill coming and going.
1421550644|5.0|One of the best comic stories I've ever read. The art is also amazing. I wish Hayao Miyazaki had done more comics. The box set is also beautiful and makes a great centerpiece for any bookshelf. If you like science fiction, philosophy and great characters you're doing yourself a disservice not reading this.
B0012GMZKE|3.0|It was an Ok cd though not my best, but the distortion drove me to return it for a full refund using my Prime.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|They Finaaly have candy crush on amazon..... Praise the lord. I'm so happy because I'm such a candy crush addict.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|This is such a great gift from one of my best songwriters!  I love how his voice is mellowing in his later works.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I love Joe's music and enjoy how he features local artists and gives it a new twist. I saw the concert on you tube abd had to have it. I was not disappointed.
0152465030|5.0|I ordered this for my sweetheart as hers was stolen when her shipping container from FedEx was opened during shipping.  She was heartbroken as her 30 something children were read from her book.  This was a wonderful replacement and it will be her treasure to keep forever until her grandchildren's children get it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time Candy Crush made it to Amazon for the Kindle. I have been waiting a long time for this game to get here. I have tired of eating up my phone data playing it when I could be using my Kindle.  Excellent.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The quests are achievable and fun, and I love a good find-the-object game. However, it's impossible to move forward in the game without spending money on upgrades.
1616550414|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend as a get well present from his surgery. He's a big zelda fan and he loves it. I am also a zelda fan and the book has awesome art and history about all the legend of zelda games up to Skyward Sword. I might order one for myself soon.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I love Star Trek for the impossible future and the story of mankind rising up to a higher potential. It has been in our culture so long that it seems like reality. Maybe it is, in another universe. This chapter plays like a violent video game, lots of fancy equipment and high tension situations all appealing to the target audience of young men. But the characters are still there, there is still some depth to them which keeps me coming back.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I loved playing this game.  I always love these games and this one is hard enough to make it interesting and challenging.  The objects that you need to find are very well hidden and are unusual.  The background is well done and the game itself is all around fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for it to get to the Kindle,thank you! I will be on here all the time now.Lol..<br />.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|We couldn't get this to work well for us.  Not that it is the products fault. Maybe the ones trying to install it and get it working with our TV and computer.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have been a fan of Brandon Sanderson's work since I read the Mistborn Trilogy.  This was just another example of why I continue reading books from Mr. Sanderson.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|It seems hokey to genuinely love the music from a favorite TV show, but that's what happened!  I love that all my favorite actors also have amazing singing chops and that the songs and the lyrics from the show are so haunting that I found myself wanting to be able to hear these songs again and again.  I am truly enjoying both volume 1 & 2 and hope there will eventually be a volume 3!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|I was surprised how much I loved this movie. So campy, it takes a lot of shots at American culture, much of it painfully true. If you love sci-fi and camp you will love this. I highly recommend it.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I have enjoyed the whole Spartacus series.  This particular set of DVD's is filled with excitement and drama.  Has some Adult content and I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|I was really looking forward to viewing this movie but was VERY disappointed in the quality of the effects, story line changes and pacing.  This movie is often touted as being on the effects level of &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; but I would equate it more on the level of the first season of &#34;Star Trek: The Next Generation&#34; or &#34;Babylon 5&#34;.  The effects shots are so short, so badly paced, and frankly skipped over in spots (due to budget constraints I can only imagine) that some plot points happen off camera and nonsensical things happen.  The pacing also slows down at dramatic spots that you actually start wondering what is going on everywhere else (slow pacing during an &#34;emergency&#34; makes no sense).  Overall there is much more believe-ability in most US television shows that in this movie. Storyline changes pull too much from other unrelated movies and not in a good way. The original story and plot points were so much better. This movie really frustrated me in that all the effort was put in to make it and it turned out so badly.<br />The one thing I really enjoyed is how some of the original score was woven in. That was really good.<br />But I was still left very disappointed and sad about how bad this was.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great read. One of those books that had a surprise every time you thought you knew what was happening.<br />A real easy read and well written. I am sure you will enjoy it too.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is very addictive and fun. I love being able to play bingo and slots!  BUT... sometimes it freezes and I lose either bingo chips when playing bingo, or coins when playing slots. The other thing that bothers me is that the power coins seem to assign to DO and the TREASURE CHEST. With these 3 issues, I gave it 4 stars. I still love playing Bingo Blitz!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|We hear a lot of talk about people &#34;cutting the cord&#34; with regards to cable TV, but by adding this cord, I can now connect my Kindle to my big screen and view tons of content on the larger,more family friendly screen.  Easy connections, good solid product.
B008EL25LE|5.0|lots of replay value due to options to change mode and powerups.  the story was nicely done and kept me interested long after I usually am with match games.  loved the art and found the puzzles at times very challenging.  all in all a great game and a pleasant surprise.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Why did it take me so long to read this book?!<br />The HBO series does a reasonable job of staying<br />true to the story line in the first book. George R.R. Martin's<br />writing style is detailed and captures the imagination<br />so completely, that even though I knew the storyline,<br />i had a hard time putting down the book.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I saw this in the theater. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Best zombie apocalypse movie I've ever seen by far.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|Easy (but not too easy) to play.  Can expand play options with extra purchase.  Haven't done that yet, but there's lots to buy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My first impression was that this book wouldn't be good and I needed something to read for my long commute on the train. So for $10 I was like, &#34;What the hell, why not?&#34;. So I started reading it and was like, &#34;Wow! What a great book.&#34;. Love all the documentary of the survivors from the zombie apocalypse and how different their personalities are. Some even heroes/heroins while other villains, a perfect representation of the diversity of human minds. Overall a wonderful and exquisite book.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This author explains extremely well how cancer is developing from our own cells morphed into cancer by some agents  on micro biotic level.You don't have to be a medical specialist ,oncologist,scientist to understand the cause,process and may be the cure or suppression of  the future dealings with cancer.Molecular genetic theraphy may be the way of the future facing many illnesses once considered incurable.
0385349947|5.0|Many important principles and personal examples that drive home the importance of expressing your needs in the workplace and expecting good things.  Good things for yourself, your other woman colleagues, and the men with whom you share the workplace.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|At first as a non English speaker with no latin backgroun,names and places were buffling.After  chapter 3,I was fascinated by the way its written  and how book hunter found the ancient poems.Now I know what Vellum came from ! Fascinating read,very well written  and loved Poggios book hunting trip and his family life! Recommend it to anyone who is curious about Lucretius,Cecero, and the way books were created.
B004DM0UII|2.0|Nice app but on my Galaxy Note II it will automatically try and play Dropbox mp3s (and fail miserably). Can't unlink the permissions; never told it to link to Dropbox. Uninstalling.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Because I loved The Kite Runner & A Thiusand Splendid Suns, my expectations were very high.  I was somewhat bored throughout the middle. The beginning and end were fine and the style of writing is lovely, but I really wanted to be more engaged with the characters.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Similar to what Patrick said about other book amazing book: - I loved it! What else is there to say?<br />Here it said I need other six words to publish the review. Done.
B009X01FJS|5.0|The Marware Revolve Portrait case is perfect for my Kindle Fire HD.  It was a little harder to get my Kindle to &#34;click&#34; into place than I expected but because of that, I feel it is secure in the case.  At first, I could not get my Kindle to turn in the case but after several attempts, I realized I was turning it the wrong way!  Duh!!!  My only tiny, tiny issue is that in order to watch or read my Kindle while charging, I have to turn my Kindle in the case so the charging outlet is at the top.  That is really a minor issue.  I recommend this case to anyone with a Kindle Fire HD and would purchase another one should this one get damaged.  Good buy!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've always been a Stephen King fan so I can't speak for anyone else but once I got past the first 100 pages I couldn't put it down.
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|This has got to be one of the best jazz presentations this year.  Corea has done it again bringing together so many elements and rhythms and just making them work  Definitely worth going back to again and again.  Not trite, not repetitive, not boring.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King as usual doesn't disappoint,from the  Overlook to Maine Danny helps another child with the Shining, read it you won't want it to end!!
B001BANK32|4.0|It was a little slow in the beginning. The latter part of the book kept my  interest .Of course. This was an unrealistic story, which I don't particular enjoy. However, I will continue to read Stephen King's books.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Glad to see Stephen getting back to this type of book. Hope that he continues to write more stories like this.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Nice app for Android! I like to read with this - the best I've seen for Android so far. The only thing is that it is a bit slow to start but that does not bother too much.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|The Croods (Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD + Digital Copy) is a great movie and the 3D is high quality.
B0041KW6HU|5.0|I enjoyed this BD with 5.1 channel sound and 46 inch TV.<br />It was a satisfying experience in video and sound quality compared with DVD performance.<br />I am sure this BD is only best media to view this story at the best quality as possible.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|The Little Mermaid (Three-Disc Diamond Edition) (Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD... is a Disney classic and my kids love it as much as I did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to get book two!! I absolutely loved the hunger games. Right up my ally, action packed love story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It has been a long time since I watched one of these kinds of movies. Yes there is a lot of hit a guy and he slides a smashes a wall junk, but there was some funny stuff and entertainment. I did enjoy!
B006QKKMBA|5.0|It was great. Lots of death. Everything a horror movie is suppose to be!  I will never go over a bridge again.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|really enjoying this app.  easy to get concepts.  haven't been. able to login online yet as the website was down.  think supplementing. the app will also help me learn.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I saw previews to this movie and the concept piqued my interest in the book.  I guess that was my first mistake, since (as is usually true) the book was much better than the movie.  I'm not necessarily upset that the movie strayed from the story line, I'm just disappointed in the new storyline they told. It could have been better developed.  And although the cinematography was quite nice, the sequencing seemed a bit chaotic and random.  It made for a confusing, &#34;meh&#34; movie
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It reminded what a good writer Stephen King is. I read all his books and this us one of his best!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a fun game and it is fun to connect with friends on facebook. It is kind of hard to stop playing.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|This album is what you come to expect from this legendary band. Some rock, some ballad and a lot of in between.
B000000OU0|4.0|Wonderful music. Had to replace another CD of the same title since we literally wore it out. Now our daughter needs one.
B00028HBKC|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE , VERY SAD AND TOUCHING.....MADE MY WIFE CRY , REALLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO LOVES INSPIRATIONAL MOVIES.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|Bad actors, not a define trama, very unrealistic video dont spent your time with this video, very boring, bad end
0307341577|4.0|I read Gillian Flynn's &#34;Gone Girl&#34; a few weeks prior to ordering &#34;Dark Places&#34;. I had some qualms with &#34;Gone Girl&#34; but wanted to give Flynn another chance because I did enjoy her style. I wasn't disappointed. I got the book and set it aside, not picking it up for several weeks but once I did, I spent a whole rainy Saturday totally absorbed in the story. Before I knew it, it was 3am and I was on the last few pages, the intensity of the story keeping me going until the very end, I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I wouldn't say I loved it, but I did really like it. Maybe not a great choice for those who are super squeamish, but very suspenseful and if you like a good mystery with a side of the macabre, &#34;Dark Places&#34; might be what you're looking for
0670024856|5.0|Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, The Signature of All Things follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker—a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction—into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist—but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe—from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who—born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution—bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas.\\"<br /><br />I was expecting to love this book, and I did. It was a bit different than I thought it would be, but nonetheless a marvelous work in many respects. I've never read Elizabeth Gilbert's famous memoir Eat, Pray, Love, or any of her fiction, but I might pick them up in the future if I get around to it. Despite the fact that it was the plot that drew me in, it was the writing that made me stay and enjoy this novel. I just loved the vaguely 19th century narrative style of the book, faintly reminiscent of Austen (and indeed, in the press packet, Gilbert says that Austen was one of the 19th century writers she read in preparation for the book). There was also that singular way of speaking directly to the audience at times, such as towards the beginning of the novel when Gilbert shifts away from Alma's story to talk about her father's early life, saying \\"how her father came to be in possession of such great wealth is a story worth telling here, while we wait for the girl to grow up and catch our interest again.\\" (pg. 7). If every book was like this, it would be rather annoying. But as it is, this style was amusing and fitting for the book. It's also one of those rather long novels with lots of great, diverting side-notes, and yet it's not overwritten at all. The Signature of All Things is compulsively readable and extremely compelling.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert's style is also one of little dialogue and lots of narration, except for specific dialogue-heavy scenes. Again, I wouldn't want to have every book I read be something like this, but it worked here, and I didn't find the novel boring. At all. It was thoroughly absorbing, and I found Alma a fascinating character. In fact, all of the characters were really interesting, none of them being totally good or bad, all of them with sympathetic sides. As Elizabeth Gilbert says in the aforementioned interview, there are no real \\"villains\\" in the story, only complicated, flawed people, all of whom were fascinating to read about, particularly in the early sections, Alma's parents, who I at times disliked and admired. I particularly found Alma's father, the at times vicious, at times loving Henry Whittaker an interesting puzzle. He made his immense fortune by less than gentlemanly means, and yet as Gilbert points out, he'd be the first to admit it. And he is kind - sort of, in his own way.<br /><br />The story itself is just utterly fascinating and engrossing, and so, so creative. The novel spans the entire century during which so much new scientific exploration was done, and religion and science sort of began to clash. In the interview (which isn't in the actual book; sorry), Elizabeth Gilbert pointed out some really interesting things, such as how painful that split was for many people who had to choose between wholehearted religious belief and science (although not everyone had to choose, of course). However, when Alma is first born and as she grows up in the early 19th century, belief in both is still entirely possible, but through the lens of her intriguing life we see everything on that front change. I've never quite been able to put my finger down on why I'm really interested in the 19th century, and maybe this is part of the reason, because the transition into the more modern world really begins in the 19th century, and I enjoy reading about the changing sensibilities of the time. Elizabeth Gilbert really captures the wonder of the time, the sense of everything being really new and just waiting to be discovered. There were so many unknown creatures and plants that it must have been almost magical to be part of that. Today, there are still many scientific things we don't fully understand, but most of them live deep in the ocean and thus are less relatable, I suppose you could say. She also portrays the opportunism that was there for those clever enough to take it, such as Henry Whittaker, who uses new natural discoveries and his experience in botany to make fabulous amounts of money. It was also the beginning of a time when the heretofore rigid class structure started bending just a little bit, as evinced by the fact that Henry, who was born in abject poverty, becomes one of the wealthiest men in the New World. There are so many new markets opening up on various fronts and class barriers breaking down, and this expansive novel really covers a whole lot of extraordinary things that were going on in the 19th century. Obviously, this process was continued throughout the early twentieth, but it really started here.<br /><br />One of the other topics addressed in the book is that of 19th century views on sexuality, which is also very interesting. It's quite closeted (in Alma's case, literally), and talking about such things is rather frowned upon, especially for women. It's quite natural though that an intelligent young woman like Alma would want to know about these things, and that was an enjoyable part of the book, although it did strike me as a bit odd at first. As Gilbert mentions in the interview, The Signature of All Things also has many portrayals of flawed marriages, of women stuck in them. What I found particularly striking here was that it's not that either of the people are bad per se; they're just ill-suited to one another, and in the 19th century there's not that much you can do about it once you're married. She's talking about the marriages of the three friends, Alma, Prudence, and Retta (who's quite mad), but I think it could be applied to a lot of people both in the novel and out.<br /><br />I believe that in her memoir Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth Gilbert travels to various places across the globe, and The Signature of All Things takes place in many parts of the world, though chiefly Philadelphia, but also \\"from London to Peru to Tahiti to Amsterdam.\\" There were many both beautiful and disturbing settings, but also compelling evocations of so many exotic places in many parts of the book, starting off right at the beginning with the story of Henry Whittaker's travels. I loved these scenes, because Gilbert really called up the sights, sounds, and smells of these varied places in colonial times.<br /><br />The Signature of All Things is definitely worth all the hype it's been getting of late. It had gorgeous writing and description, fascinating characters, a very creative plot, and it talked about some really interesting ideas and concepts, showing a world on the cusp of the modern age and in the midst of a frenzy of scientific discovery. I would highly recommend this novel. I received a review copy from Viking.<br /><br />[...]

B00632HWOG|5.0|They recently had an update to the Yahoo mail system for Androids, and it was a night mare. They kept coming up with updates after updates to make it work, and I had to get all me mail from my computer. I couldn't use my mobile devices for email for almost a week. But as time goes, they did get it fixed, and I'm happy with it once again!!

Impressed with the quality of the bag for the price.  I was able to pack 2 complete camera setups ( strobe included ) and my notebook fit easily in the front pocket.  You can easily remove the Velcro pockets to accommodate any type of packing construction.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|Recommended for any Harry Potter Fan trying to complete their collection, a movie well worth the wait for money well spent.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|Love the length. Got this because my son uses my kindle fire to play games and watch movies and he wears the charger cables out to the point that they don't fit tight anymore they get loose and you have to set it certain way for it to charge. I got two of these just because of the wear and tear. The first one was loose outta the package. And it isn't the charger port itself because my husband kindle fire cable fits perfectly.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I have been a life long star trek fan. Although there were some creative differences, it was a good movie.  Keep making more.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Got this for my kindle fire since my son has claimed it for himself lol. Didn't have the kindle a month and my son dropped it and got a crack in the corner so I got a leather covet and stand until my son decided to pick at it and it fell apart. I got this case so far I love it. Only thing I would change is the stand it works but I don't feel its secure enough. My leather stand had a tab to hold it in place, not a groove. It works and that's all I care about.
B0094KOSO6|5.0|I even enjoyed it the one-thousandth time my son and I watched it. You can't go wrong with this one.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Really nothing unique about this film. Too much CGI for my taste. Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love all the books, however if I had known they were going to be as drawn out as they are, I would of opted to wait...Waiting for years for another book is just not acceptable to me... I don't like how he just leaves a character and never talks about him again for a whole book.... I loved the dwarf and never heard anything else and I have to wait for other characters as well... I'm sure it is making him a lot of money but it does not do well for my frustration... I read the first five books in eight days, devouring them.... I need and want more and sooner not later.
1582701709|5.0|When you need directions for your life, this is a good book to pick up. The information is very plain and to the point. If you have not read any of these books by Rhonda Burns, now is a good time.
