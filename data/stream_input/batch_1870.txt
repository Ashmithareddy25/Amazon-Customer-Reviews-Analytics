B007PKSN6Q|5.0|The music to the movie is outstanding!  Would be better if a version of the music was offered with the original artists singing their songs!
B002C4YYEU|4.0|My family really enjoyed this movie, it did take us two nights to watch it. Great concept, makeup was awesome!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I like it its just it cost a lot of money,  and you can't make armour. Plus you can't make some things I would love to make. All and all its a good game.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|The album takes you back to all the movie scenes and lets you relive them in memory.  Powerfully done score.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Very easy to learn. My family absolutely owned me on this game. I did buy a bunch of brain erasers to use as a means to keep track of who was winning. That is the only reason I knocked one star off.
0307405095|5.0|Love this book....this is the second book of Martha's that I have purchased...(about baking). The instructions are easy to understand and she gives you the reason WHY she is doing things a certain way.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great book. The kind that makes you believe in love and the fairytale that you can believe in.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Well built, reall looking, does everything you'd want.  Child is very happy with it.  Always playing with it.  Smiles all around.
B008NA3I30|4.0|The relationship between the married couple seems quite akward, and void of any sexual attraction.  The woman seems like she's just hot to trot and stuck on getting some from the man she meets while on vacation (why didn;t she take her husband?). There is no real resolution for the woman as far as I can see.  Too bad she couldn't get it on with hubby.
0307236722|5.0|I love anything Martha Stewart does. Great book! I am a beginner baker, and she takes you through the book in steps..so that you can't skip anything.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is truly amazing, it's an amazing sequel to the trilogy. Highly recommended that you read this book. AMAZING!
B0000042MY|5.0|Loved the movie and realized why the music made it so enjoyable.  Transports me back to the time and events in the movie.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Works great, really good picture and I got it in a good amount of time that I ordered it. I Love this movie!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Bought this to catch up on the episodes I missed.  It has the entire second season.  My daughter has begun watching The Walking Dead with me and loves the idea of having the entire season on DVD!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Pie is good.I am mad that l cannot blow up that though. Why do they have a crafting table if you can't craft.no pickaxe
1439130833|5.0|Great Book - I will be passing this along to my little sister so she can enjoy reading it as well!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I want more!!!! Please have a sequel! This book just took my breath away, it was not what I expected and in the best way possible. It made me cry, laugh out loud and get butterflies in my tummy , it's just amazing, this just made number 1 on my all time favorite list.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Great 3 DVD set with extra features, very good resolution.  It is very handy having all episodes together in order to view the first season's missed episodes.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love grisham, simple, no need for a in depth dissertation of his newest novels merits--- I couldn't put it down and was a fun read as always! First read on my new kindle fire too, love it!!!
B0060D123K|4.0|This edition of the film does not include the relationship between Belle and Scrooge. It leaves out \\"When Love Is Gone\\". This scene was included in the home video release on VHS but is not included in the Amazon Instant Video edition.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|All u expect in a teacher novelties always delivers enough of what u want and a little bit of dofferent
B001NXDIMK|5.0|DAMAGES (DVD) I have purchased all 4 seasons of the show and enjoyed them very much.  My only disappointment was that there was only 4 seasons.  I would certainly buy more if there was more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm so obsessed with this trilogy you have no idea how many times I've read this even after the move. I would give this ten stars!!!
B002E66C6E|5.0|Always a big fan of submarine movies.. Das Boot, K-19 widowmaker, Below and this one tops the chart for me.
B001I0T92Q|2.0|The CR-5400 is widely recommended on PSP forums as an alternative to using a genuine Memory Stick, but this product is inferior to a generic dual slot adapter. The CR-5400 exhibits a 15-20 second delay when loading the Video menu, and there is a similar amount of unexplained drive activity after backing out of USB mode. The generic dual slot adapter exhibits neither of these behaviors. Furthermore, of the three CR-5400 adapters I've purchased on Amazon, one of them had mangled pins from the factory and was only made functional after some tricky surgery with a watchmaker's screwdriver. This product should be avoided - use a generic adapter instead.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|bought for a zombie fan. haven't played it yet, but, he was happy to receive it. i'm sure any zombie fan would love it
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Boring I did not like it at ALL!!!!! It stinks. I do not at all recommend it. Never read it. Ever!!!!!!!!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I discovered Lindsey via Pandora and I cant stop listening to this album! The original music she has composed on this album is simply amazing! With a bit of trance and dubstep mixed with violin make this more then original, it really is genius! A type of classical music for today, it is the type of music I have been looking for for a long time.  This Violinist is the most talented I have heard and she can play anything!  Look her up on youtube, as others have already said her music is only part of the package!
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Great cast, but the movie is so tacky.<br />I do like the rock and roll songs, but the show setting in drunken rock clubs is not my thing.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The story is entertaining, but the format of the book made the story seem disjointed. It's odd there is no main character in the story and that makes you not greatly emotionally connected to the story.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Story slowed a bit, but once rolling the characters and details proved another compelling and well written novel.  Eagerly awaiting to read the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was given this book as a gift as was initially hesitant to read them seeing as I am not quite in the age group the were targeted towards. The action was hard to look away from and the characters were very easy to empathize with.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I was looking for a cover to my Kindle Fire HD and I chose this one wrongly,because it is for a Kindle Fire not for a Kindle Fire HD.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|If you love Christmas music, this is a must have collection. Andrea did it again. I saw it on PBS last year and I really recommend it everyone.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|It's okay, but could be a lot better.  The family &#34;drama&#34; is a bit too soapy and the interactions have been somewhat inconsistent across the first several episodes.  The best part of the show are the flashbacks, but the more they do that the less intriguing it will become.  It's like all the ingredients for a really good show are there, but the writers haven't yet figured out the perfect recipe.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An amazing sequel. The pace stays the same and the characters are as magnetic as the first book. A must if you liked The Hunger Games.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, though the original Diary of a Wimpy Kid will always be my favorite of the series. But, I really encourage readers to purchase this book! :)
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is a great sound track. I would recommend this to any one who likes Les Miserables and even those who don't.  But you should definitely check out the 25th Anniversary performance at the O2!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Love the digital copy so I don't have to pirate something I already own. Blu ray and all extras played flawlessly.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Doesn't make it a complete set if  Episode IV is missing? DVD's work but I paid for 6 movies and 3 bonus DVD's.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Barely made it through.  Uninteresting characters and story line. There's nothing about this to recommend in my opinion. Can't even give it away as it's on my Kindle.
1416575464|1.0|A Kindle version was listed months ago for presale. The release date continued to change to later and later with the most recent release date listed as Dec. 25th 2012. When I came back to try to purchase the Kindle version, it was nowhere to be found.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great building and strategy game for my grandson. He loves playing it every day. He loves fighting the zombies, skeletons, spiders and creepers.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie and it teaches our kids (and reminds us) of what our future will be like unless we make some serious changes... a great conversation starter!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Much better than I even hoped!  Great sound.  No wires to roll over in my chair (and break!)  Great 7.1 sound... Made my first person shooter games much more immersive... I'm hearing things that I never heard before with previous wired headsets or with my alec lansing 5.1 speakers.  I also use a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse with no interference.  In short, couldn't be happier with these headphones.
B0081BU42O|4.0|I'm always looking ahead for the next Iain M. Banks novel, who's my favorite author, and I pre-ordered this one. As always, he writes a great story and it is easy to get wrapped up in it and forget the time.  But this time the ending didn't click for me; usually he throws in a twist and everything falls into place and the novel is great. The story he paints this time still includes all the cool Culture aspects- sweeping pictures of worlds and civilizations, intrigues and details of technology-loaded battles. But I'll have to read it again to see if I missed something that would make it as great as his other sci-fi (I've only read one Iain Banks non-scifi and I'll read more). Nevertheless, I'll still recommend it and will read anything he authors, especially the sci-fi.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I enjoyed the story. A fun and quick read.  Not royalty seriios or dramatic but captured me enough to get the next book in the series.
B0014VQGX4|4.0|There are some fragile bits to this so he has to be careful but he loves it so much he's doing well with that. I wish more parts were made of metal versus plastic to ensure longevity.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Relax to the legend that is Marley. Makes you want to catch a flight to Jamaica mon', kick off your shoes & grab a lounge chair in the shade & tip it on back
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has created a rich, deeply emotional piece of music and her voice is incredible! I just love her crisp, sultry, heartfelt vocals. She rocks!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Entertaining and fun. I really enjoyed this book. Even it got a bit weird at times it was a good teenage and young adult book.
B00979CS50|5.0|I am a big neil young fan and I was a ble to buy this on pre=order. It was a great gift for my husband.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I think Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones represent a lot of older couples in this movie.  They're very proper and traditional and don't talk about sex the way they are forced to during the therapy sessions.  It reminded me that at every age there are relationship struggles.  As a young unmarried person, it was good for me to see this and to realize that the grass isn't always greener in relationship world.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Great movie! The sound and music are amazing! It would be an excellent addition to any movie collection.<br />Disney comes through once again! Highly recommended!
B001706I5I|5.0|Jim Carrey truly at his best. He puts his own spin on the character while retaining some key qualities of The Grinch that we all grew up with.  Definitely worth watching every year!
B0063IH60K|1.0|This game is not useable. Before every game was an ad for some other AP. I have deleted it from the Kindle.
B0013O123Q|1.0|The rape scene was unnecessarily long and very disturbing.  Had to fast forward through it.  The movie never redeemed itself.  Videography was annoying - camera was all over the place.  I don't care what the artistic point of this movie was.  It was awful!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I got turned onto Sherlock by a friend, and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I wasn't sure that I would like it, as I'm kind of a Doyle/Holmes snob, but I found this adaptation refreshingly modern while still having hints of the original. Give it a chance, but beware, the episodes are quite long!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very unpredictable which I enjoyed. I would recommend this to anyone ages 14 and up because it does take some reading into to understand
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down as I wanted/needed to know what would happen next.  Good, clean & entertaining story to read.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I love the idea that these &#34;mature&#34; characters were willing to be so adventurous so late in life.  It inspired me to be more adventurous and to realize that you can change your life at any age!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|While Homeland can get a bit intense, it's a wild ride, and you should make sure that you are really ready before you jump into it. The characters have quite a bit of complexity, and it's easy to miss little things, but I think that overall, the series does a really good job focusing in on the fundamental tension within Brody. I also think that it helps clarify exactly what is meant by white-washed concepts like drone strikes and enhance interrogation, and opens up a lot of room for discussion about what is an appropriate level of privacy in the US.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|At first I thought, only one puzzle?  Then I kept playing it and realized that I find this game worth the money.  Good offering for .99.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book had me intrigued right from the start. The character interactions are great and the intense sensuality is very well written. You crave more interaction between the two main characters. As the book nears a close the character flaws of Eva get a little monotonous, even though I think the jealousy is meant to be part of the sensuality. That to me made the ending chapters a little dry. However.... this book over all was great and I will be reading the second one.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Put this collection on and get ready to sing along to every song.  Shows Kelly's range of styles from a career that will certainly continue for years to come.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I can watch this movie again and again and never get bores if it! Great laughs and great music! Cast did an awesome job!
B009DCOU9S|3.0|too many speeches in between puzzles which are not that difficult. I like more searches. for the price its ok.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|The New Oxford American Dictionary. it makes my fingers ache just to type it out. i never did like dictionaries, and they get bigger every year. it's like for every new word dropped, 5 are added. are these new words really needed? well, we've gotten along fine workouts<br /><br /> them, haven't we? it's also that only someone wanting to win a bet would read an entire dictionary. must we know what hoot means, as an example? do we even need, or want, this word in the English language? i didn't think so. we shouldn't get rid of the dictionary. we need it. but could we PLEASE shorten it a little?! save some trees here! that's why i think this dictionary is , as far the meanings go, is good, but the reality of how much people are going to read or want to read is WAY off.............
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|I loved the film overall but it leaves this impact on you which is hard to wash away all together.
0345802934|4.0|This is my first Murakami book and i toughly enjoyed the book and his writing style . To me , the story is more of the journey then the end as i felt that the ending was rather lackluster.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A good friend recommended the Lee Child books to me this year.  Coincidentally, the Jack Reacher movie came out this month too.  I enjoyed the book so much that I intend to purchase and read all the rest of the Jack Reacher series.  If you are a fan of crime fiction, you'll love these books.  My husband is interested in reading them too.  I was told that you do not need to read them in order, although it helps, so I plan to read them in order.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Interesting... Dark... Gripping... A well written novel with a most unexpected ending. This book has changed the way I view twist endings and has left me searching for more books like it.
B0001ARCFA|1.0|the  photo I saw was a item Made in Austria, the one I got was made in china and the quality is not the same.<br />the seller said he would refund a return and that  this  model is not made in Austria  anymore.<br />Seller Good , product BAD.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|As someone who reads a large range of YA novels, very few have made me feel with the characters. To me, that is the true sign of a great novel. The YA world is filled with hits and misses, but this is a hit. Aside from The Fault in Our Stars by John Green, nothing has made me consider life, love, and death. Forman does a formidable job with this work and I look forward to Where She Went.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I learned how to play Mahjhon from my Chinese roommate in college,this game' s tiles are very similar to the ones I learned with.  Thanks for bringing back fond memories.
B009FKZ9AM|5.0|Just as good, if not better than their first album. I highly recommend this album. Every song is good enough to be a single.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Cellblock Tango is a hoot!  Great show with a great cast!! I recommend it.  Catch it in live theatre for an added treat ;)
B00785P2QC|4.0|I downloaded this game on a whim but I've been playing non stop.  So much fun.  Highly recommend if you want a sim city like game.
B004NDVJWI|5.0|My daughter was very surprised to receive this gift, and we listened to it every time we got in the car on Christmas day.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|great family movie for a night in. best one yet. sad and good and funny . a must see film
B000P0J0A6|4.0|I was able to enjoy this classic Holiday movie with my young niece and nephew, who may have enjoyed the movie more than me!  Will watch it again next year!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This one was very hard to get through. I finished, but it took forever. So much of the same immature writing from the last two. This one has no realy new messages or scenes. If you are an avid reader, don't bother. Ask someone what happens.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works perfectly with the current Linux kernel, recognized out-of-the-box, no special configuration or patches needed.<br /><br />It's a serial adapter, how much else can I say?
0439023513|5.0|This book is very very very very good.  I love it everyone in my house had read this series of books.
B000P0J09W|3.0|I saw this when my 30-year-old was a kid and will enjoy watching it with my nieces and nephews!  Hidden treasure and best buddies..who could want more?
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The first was ok. This one was more of the same. I could have skipped it my since I started, I had to finish. And as a PR consultant, I had to finish since we have a line of products from the book.
B002JVWR54|5.0|This was an awesome show that was canceled too soon, and never had the chance in the Friday night death slot.  It's awesome, features great cast members that Joss loves to work with.
0439023491|5.0|This book is very very very very good.  I love it everyone in my house had read this series of books.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It takes a really good book for me to finish and this book does just that. Very beautifully written! Love it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|As an avid reader, I fouond the writing in this book was immature and hard to read. However, I love the message it is sending to women! It is creating freedoms to explore that many have never really felt before. I would recommend it to anyone, including men!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great app for kids to play not to hard . Amazon is a great place every time I get on here' I always find something great
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Great product. Holds 3 hand held cameras and accessories.  I would recommend this to all the Grandmas who don't go to grand kids sports events without multiple cameras.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|half way through the movie it skipped then no sound all of  sudden. the dvd looked perfect, no scratches at all
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Never had any problem with this app much better then many others I have tried in the past tell your friends
B000I0QL82|5.0|Loved going back in history to old movies.  Younger and innocent time.  Wish it was colorized.  Will b a tradition in future.
B000WT5IUQ|5.0|This is the only Christmas CD I need. So many wonderful memories and will be in my collection forever. I always get in the spirit with this cd.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this film! It is fun and full of good music. Good for girl nights and even for a date.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book is all about people, seeing someone worthy and taking a chance. Taking a leap of faith every now and then might be worth it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent .. all the way. Would recommend ..!!!! Fast shipping. Will buy again .. Great Company to shop with Amazon
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another fabulous Stephen King Novel - What a great story, this one is hard to put down.  Interesting to take yourself back to the 1960's.
1419705849|5.0|Third of three books I ordered for a young girl as a Secret Santa.  She loved the books and of course that made my Christmas complete!
B0081SPK0I|3.0|FF2R is a time killer. If you have nothing else to do it's an okay lil app to play. Puts you in the mindset of the old NES days. A bit of nostalgia is always welcomed. It's definitely not a Need For Speed or Asphalt type game, but it does it's job. You can select among three different characters, but as far as I can see there aren't any unlockable characters. Each character has their own car and again I didn't see anything that would make me think another car or upgrades would be available. The controls are very easy to use and customizable to your pleasure. Again it's a time killer and not much better than that, but as far as simple time killing games go this is a good game. Much better than throwing a balled up piece of paper at a trash can!
0307593525|5.0|After listening the movie Julie and Julia, the Julis child books are a must in a kitchen. My wife was very happy!
B00005JKDR|1.0|The movie froze right in the beginning so we didn't get to watch it. My grandchildren were very disapointed with their gift.
1419702238|5.0|Ordered as Secret Santa for a young girl.  She was very excited and loved the books and that made my Christmas complete!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I like that you made this dictionary, because it helps me out alot when i am on the go and need a definition for a word.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you search up pocket inv editor and get pocket inv editor you can go from creative to survival an  get whatever you want
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Bad story. Bad jokes. Nothing funny about it. Can't belive Seth Mcfarlane made this. Save your money and don't rent this.
B003VANOFY|5.0|My cat loves to chew through wires, so many of my headphones have been destroyed by her. I decided after my last pair that I should invest in a good pair of headphones that won't get destroyed by the two most common things in my life: Cat chewing the wires, or my head breaking the arms off. I also love to play video games, so I wanted a mic that was attached instead of a separate device... so I was torn between two sets of headphones: these, and the Corsair Vengeance 2000. I visited many different forums that compare the two, and it kept coming down to personal preference. I finally came across someone saying that &#34;they are both amazing headphones, but look around your computer. How many Corsair devices do you have? Probably 0. How many Logitech do you have?&#34; (I use a Logitech mouse.) &#34;Probably more than 0, eh? Corsair is probably a good company, but I have many different Logitech things that are still reliable and great. Which do you want; headphones by a company that you've used before, or headphones from a company that cost more and you've never used before? Because both of the headphones are pretty much the same, go with the company.&#34; So I went with Logitech.<br /><br />They are great headphones. I have big ears and a big head, and the headphones can be adjusted for the big head. The ear cups are one-size fits all, and surprisingly, my ears do fit inside of them. I've used them for about two months, and I am very happy with my purchase.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I actually really like the idea behind this story. I love that Megan is an independent woman, and I love that the two find \\"love\\" when neither of them are looking for it at all. Unfortunately, Conner is so disgustingly self- obsessed, controlling, manipulative and possessive it ruins the story for me. He is only concerned with what she could do for him and all her independence is right out the window. These things are acknowledged but only justified by the \\"something there.\\"<br /><br />I wasn't convinced. Only disgusted. If you relate to a woman with brain, don't read this book. Not even for free.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book !!<br /><br />I'll recommend it to a friend.<br /> She likes to read ..are there series books by the author?
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Good little movie to watch with your wife while spooning. Funny and sexy at the same time. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|He put this together in about one hour.  He liked everything about.  He said it was very easy to assemble.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is the anthem to my life. The peanut butter to my jelly. The pun was intended. Peace out
B0099G3I96|3.0|Decent release but nothing really outstanding. Gets a bit  too samey at times, but still some good tracks. Fun, ear candy.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is great. I laughed and cried along with every page. An excellent read for a romantic at heart.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Hilarious adventures underground!  Who knew that there were so many undocumented aliens from other planets hiding in plain sight?  Wonderful!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|No words can describe how perfect this book is.<br />I am not some important critic. just read the book, if you have not already.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I bought this product for a friend for Christmas and he was extremely impressed with the visual and sound effects of the movie. The 3 hours of extra he found very entertaining and this was a great gift!
B004LROUNG|5.0|The book was funnier for me than it was for a friend who is not a lawyer because I know lawyers like all three of the &#34; heroes&#34; in this book. There was more truth than fiction in the book.
B007MDB548|1.0|Brought this for my daughters birthday. Packing is awful, two of disc came in scratched because the are set one on top of the other. Story is not good for younger audience because of love story within it and the stoner fairy was not necessary at all. Very disappointed because of all of that but the animation was very good on a hi-def TV.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book was very unique and makes you question your own life and the time you have on earth through a tale of others. I really enjoyed reading this short story.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I love The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Is everything that a teen movie should be. It's one of the best \\"book to movie\\" adaptations I have ever seen, obviously because the autor made was really involved in the movie.<br />The music takes your breath away (if you loved what you hear in the film, I recommend you to get the soundtrack), the plot is very easy to fall in love with, and the screen chemistry of Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Logan Lerman is undeniable.<br /><br />I'm so getting this once it comes out. My favorite movie of the year!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Also needs ways for you to build quicker and more was to get cash andNeed to get better on cash and energy
B005HSL626|5.0|I ove this fast actiion game, it keeps my mind alert. Fast thinking is required foe this game though. Great
B000VIPJKM|4.0|This movie has many very funny parts but all in mostly believable real world scenarios.  The acting was very good in this movie.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Intel makes yet another great unlocked processor. There isn't much to say, just add it to your cart already.  The only step up is the unlocked i7.  You won't notice the difference unless you are a heavy user.  I feel that the factory cooler is a joke, but the processor is very energy efficient.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|The case is very well made and it was an awesome present from my brother for my new kindle fire. Very good product.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Typically good Grisham reading...don't know that I am 100% with the ending; kind of ended abruptly; would have liked more
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked it I have the book at home but it was a fun experience on the kindle I hope Jeff makes more!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Amazing game. Makes you actually think. Great time killer that makes you stay sharp too.<br />Five more words this makes.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|This game is good on the computer I'll admit it's pretty good on the iPad to but it won't download and I just lost three bucks to a faulty app please fix it or refund my money
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|I pre-ordered this album, got it before it really went on sale, and really love it!  What more can I say?
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Always a good show. The good wife is one of the best tv series along with homeland and dowton abbey.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I bought this album knowing two of their songs which I love so I'm hoping the rest is just as good. Also these guys are up for a grammy for\\"best Americans album\\" ...whatever that means.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It's so perfect because it's the perfect ending to a never ending to a wonderful love story with just the right amount of action
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved everything about this book and how it was written. It showed me the reality of people with cancer, one I had never encountered before. My congratulations to John Green, for writing such an extraordinary book, and for making these 5 days so exciting. I cannot tell you how much I loved it, and how much I grew attached to Hazel and Gus. Thank you for this marvellous experience, John Green, thank you so very much.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Good actors in a BAD movie. Don't waste your time or money. Wish I could get that money and time back.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I liked the movie overall, the storyline was awesome. But there were several scenes that just weren't necessary. All of the &#34;gross out to shock you&#34; scenes took away from the overall quality of the movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was excellent. Many of the events Charlie experiences are things that many can relate to. This book makes me truly want to strive to feel infinite every day!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|For a free app this does just what I need.  Keeps all my downloads in the same place... I can edit, rename, or whatever I need to do to a file... save it and I'm done.  Couldn't ask for anything more from a free app.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a fantastic album. I bought it because I had seen it everywhere but I wasn't willing to buy it for more than 12 or 15 dollars. When I saw it on sale for $2, I didn't hesitate. The entire album is worth listening to, no duds at all. And the music videos aren't bad either (though they aren't included in this purchase). Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys alt rock, AWOLNATION, and a little dash of dub step.
B00006LJ72|5.0|The music and lady go hand in hand.  Beautiful to look at and beautiful to listen too.  What a joy to listen to
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Good romp!!!! It was a good way to spend a very quiet and wonderful Christmas with my hubby.  Enough said!!
B001E5CH0G|1.0|There was something wrong with the movie. We watched it last night and the movie sequence was out of order. Very strange...I've never seen that happen before?
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Stay away.  I really like the Resident Evil series and own the first 3 on DVD but this had to be the worst one yet.  The Director tried to go with a video game theme but it just didn't translate into the movie mode.  There was also no real story line (they tried to preface the movie by incorporating historical elements from the movie) and just threw in random characters and villains from the various movies.  If you aren't a fan/previous viewer of the movies, you won't appreciate it and if you are, the fight sequences and lack of a new villain, leave something to be desired.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Everything about this movie is hilarious! Seth Macfarlane is a friggin genius! But everyone that has seen it has to admit, it would be cool as hell to have a teddy bear like Ted! Am I right?
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Good romp!!!!  Not rocket science but good fun with a  twist.  A good way to spend a quiet Christmas wiith my husband.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Wow! As usual Gameloft has made another great app. This game is the same as the newest Spiderman game, the graphics are as good as when you are playing on an Xbox! The greatest feature of this game is that it's free-roam! Therefore you can explore New York City! You also fight a lot of bosses. An extra bonus is unlocking the black Spiderman suit. Overall, I love this game it is well worth the $7.00 (I got it when it was on sale for $0.99) great job Gameloft!

B008Y2IU12|5.0|This movie had some of the best effects that I have seen in a while. The story was Pretty darn good as Well. It Pretty much followed the usual snow white storyline but of course with the usual twists that you'd expect.
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|Brought the true story behind the animals in the Harry Potter series to light. Put names and pictures to my imagination. A great addition to the Harry Potter series.

B004FEFZU2|4.0|I have watched all the Saw movies. I like them a lot, and this was no exception. I think it is a great Saw movie, and a fitting end to it all. (If indeed the series is truly over - you just know Hollywood is going to resurrect it someday, somehow...)<br /><br />* WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! *<br /><br />** I MEAN IT! MAJOR SPOILERS COMING UP! **<br /><br />*** WHAT, YOU'RE STILL HERE? OKAY, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YA! ***<br /><br />There were some things I did and didn't like about the movie.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br /><br />1. I didn't like the \\"torture porn\\" aspect. Now I realize that this is part of all the Saw movies, but it seemed a lot more obvious here. What I mean is that it seemed like there were a lot of women tortured in this movie, and all of them were really hot. Now, that may be somebody's fetish, but I'm just not into that sort of thing, okay? Torture and murder is part of the Saw movies, but I don't like it when it seems like it's more about the scene than the story. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I don't remember having this reaction from the other 6 Saw movies. Yeah, they all had their \\"hot babe being tortured\\" moments, but just seems like this one was much worse. (Or better, depending on your view.) And one of the hot babes got killed TWICE, just for good measure.<br /><br />2. I didn't like it that Bobby Dagen failed at the end. Yeah, I know he was a slimeball who got what was coming to him, but toward the end, I kind of empathized with him. I actually wanted him to succeed. Maybe that's not what the writers were going for, but that's what happened with me. I was sad when he fell.<br /><br />3. I also didn't like when the woman Bobby loved got roasted. She didn't actually deserve to die. The others, maybe... But her only crime was being dumb. I mean, come on Jigsaw, what's your problem? Normally, Mr. Jig follows a moral code. I guess in Bobby's case he made an exception. Anyway, that was pretty hard to watch.<br /><br />4. No Amanda. Yeah, I know she's toast at this point. But Jigsaw himself lives on in flashbacks. I would have liked to have seen Shawnee Smith here. But alas, it was not to be (sigh).<br /><br />5. The killing off of Jill Tuck. Was that really necessary? She was a somewhat likeable protagonist. But I guess she was cursed by being a hottie. Yeah, she was an older hottie, but a hottie nonetheless. And that's pretty much a death sentence in any Saw movie. Kind of like those who do drugs or have sex in a Jason movie. If you are female, you don't have to actually do anything bad to die in a Saw movie; you just have to look hot. Oh well, I liked her and was disappointed to see her go. (Also, would she have died instantly like she did at the end? Having a jaw blown off would hurt A LOT, but wouldn't necessarily kill you outright. I shudder to think if it had shown her still squirming there afterward...)<br /><br />6. And speaking of Jill Tuck, did anyone else notice that in the \\"suspended above the rails scene\\" it looked like she had one super hairy armpit? Maybe it was just the shadowing in the scene, but it sure looked like it. (This is where the pause button on your DVD player comes in handy.) Anyway, Jill and her hairy armpits... Actually, maybe I kinda liked that part.<br /><br />LIKES:<br /><br />1. The return of Dr. Gordon. Yeah, he's a little chubbier. (Hey, it's been over 10 years since the first movie people! It's hard to get exercise when you're an amputee.) But I can go with it. Cary Elwes is a great actor. I always thought Dr. Gordon had died, since I thought I remembered seeing a footless corpse out in the hallway in Saw 2 or 3... but apparently he's alive and well. I liked that. Some people say he was underutilized, but I think he was used just right.<br /><br />2. The appearance of Tobin Bell. Yeah, he only had a couple of parts in the movie, but considering the guy has survived I-don't-know-how-many movies now on nothing but flashbacks, it's still good to see him. And I'm always impressedhow they can fit yet another Jigsaw flashback in, and squeeze so much out of it.<br /><br />3. The guy who plays Bobby Dagen is Sean Patrick Flannery, from \\"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\\". Now I always thought that show sucked. I don't know if that was Flannery's fault or not (probably not), but it didn't hurt my feelings at all to see bad things happen to Young Indy. If he had worn the hat, I probably would have enjoyed it even more.<br /><br />4. Similar to \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\", we now have the \\"Jigsaw Survivor Group\\". This was kind of hilarious to me. It's a laughable concept really, that one killer or a small group of killers could do enough damage to society to spawn a support group for the survivors. But it was all in good fun. And I really liked the idea, for these movies. I thought it was done well.<br /><br />5. The skewering of the \\"Self Help\\" or \\"Life Coach\\" movement. I get really sick of all the Gurus on TV, going on Oprah, hawking their books, and promising to change your life for the better or whatever. That's all a bunch of b.s., and only idiots fall for that kind of junk. It was cool to see the writers of Saw 7 have fun with that. Unfortunately, there are far too many real-life \\"Bobby Dagens\\" to count...<br /><br />6. Nice cringeworthy traps, as always... Seems like these were some of the worst. I could hardly watch some of it, even knowing it was fake. My mind might know it is fake, but it is still super hard to watch. So your higher-functioning brain knows it is fake, but you still can't stop yourself from reacting emotionally to it. That's the stroke of good filmaking right there.<br /><br />7. Mark Hoffman is now more of a killer than a true acolyte. This fits his character more anyway, I think. I never liked that guy as an acolyte. I just couldn't see him filling the role of Jigsaw. He just doesn't look the part. He looks stupid. More like a linebacker than the intelligent-yet-twisted philosopher that it takes to be Jigsaw.<br /><br />8.S.U.R.V.I.V.E. It took a repeat viewing for me to realize that in the title of Dagen's book, each letter stands for something. And then throughout Dagen's traps, the messages he finds from Jigsaw spell out the chapter headings of his book. This is a really nice touch that I didn't catch the first time around.<br /><br />9. What actually happened to Bobby Dagen? The movie doesn't really show. Which to me, implies that he is still alive. I like this. I mean, it shows Hoffman blow up his Jigsaw lab, but apparently he wasn't even running Bobby Dagen's traps. So Dagen still lives. So in a way, he survived his ordeal. Even if his girlfriend did get roasted with extra barbeque sauce.<br /><br />10. Who is actually running the traps? Must be Dr. Gordon, right? The movie makes you think it was Hoffman. But then toward the end, the truth comes out. It makes sense because throughout the movie, Hoffman is more obsessed with getting revenge on Jill than running traps.<br /><br />11. Who were the 2 acolytes with Dr. Gordon at the end? I liked this, because it shows the \\"legacy\\" of Jigsaw living on, with more acolytes. Is it really the end? No way!<br /><br />12. I own the 3D Blu-Ray of this movie, and I like the 3D this has. No, it isn't \\"in your face\\", but it is still quite nice. The blood and guts fly at you sometimes. Some scenes really stand out. Also, for the 3D they had to cut down on all the quick cuts and jittery camera movements. I REALLY LIKE THIS. I'm pretty sick of all the new movie action sequences that are filmed \\"Transformers-style\\", where everything jumps and shakes around so much you can't tell what is going on. For this alone, I am thankful for the 3D version.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Saw 7 is not the greatest movie ever, but I liked it. I thought it was a fitting end to the series, at least for now. If there are no more Saw movies, then this is a good end. I am happy it is in my 3D movie collection.

B004UG7RQ0|3.0|I had the original CableJive Dock Input Cable, which worked great with any audio input, including alternate sources like sound from a tv (I have an Aux to RCA Adapter).  I recently bought this DockBoss and it works great with my phone and iPod.  However, when I tried to use it to connect my TV audio to the Bose Dock, it emits a loud hum along with the audio.  I tried the same procedure with the original cable (no longer produced or for sale anywhere on the internet) and the audio quality was superb with no hum whatsoever. Too bad this new product isn't the same overall quality as the original.

0452289963|5.0|This book definitely helped me understand my world around me and how to cope with life. Anyone struggling with &#34;who they are&#34; should read this. I personally think everyone should read it as it would make for a peaceful world.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|A nice app on my new Kindle. Crispy clear images. Browsing is fast. The only thing, is that the newsfeed will not refresh more often...it only shows me stuff posted one hour before...
B007N5YIUS|4.0|A lot of people say it doesn't work on Kindle Fire, but it does for me! It works very well and it is a great game. Highly recommend it!
B0038OY6DW|2.0|I tried to cancel this order, but your software would not let me do that. You should reveiw your software.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Awesome acting by all, Charlize and Kristen were amazing! The special effects are very cool too, A MUST SEE MOVIE! I loved it!
0316228532|4.0|I think thats the best I could come up with. I liked the book and it was well written. Apparently this is to become a movie of sorts which i am looking forward to. The characters were very well thought out and so was the story line, to be expected of Rowling.
075669812X|4.0|Bought this as a Christmas present, and it was well received.  It's a thicker book than it looks online; I'm happy with it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this mindless game. I have wasted far too many hours on it. I wish there were even more levels to beat as I have beaten all the levels an still play even though all I can get is more coins. Try it and you'll be hooked too.
B004LROMQG|5.0|The whole series is awesome and I wish it could go on a few more years! Great special effects and love all the characters!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I did not care for the book.  It was not well written at all.  Will avoid the author from now on.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have been a fan of It's a Wonderful Life for a very long time and would recommend the movie whether in black and white or color to anyone.  This is the best colorized version I have ever seen.  Normally the mouth is not colorized or what is already shown as black or white are not coloriozed and detract from the movie, because all that I would notice is what was not coloriozed or coloriozed poorly.  This is an excellent colorization and it uses colors that fit the time era as well. Love the movie and love it more now that it is in color.  Highly recommend this movie at Christmas time or any other time too. It is an AWESOME movie!!!  Everytime a bell rings!!!
B009GEEMLY|2.0|... after that it's the same ol' thing over and over.  It's all special effects with little else to offer
B0015AARJI|5.0|My son is extremely happy with this product. I am sure I will be buying more since every kid needs at least 4 controllers, so all of their friends can play.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At no time during this book could I have imagined what was going to happen.  Very well written -- a recommended read
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun game. Watch out for the extra money you might spend if you don't have your parental locks on.<br />Can be addictive for parents too.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|We watched the lion king on video when my first son was three years old, now he is nineteen, and he still lloves this movie
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book really gets to the heart of why there is so much obesity and diabetes.  I can't put it down!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved them all.  Want to start Book one, two and three all over again.  Can't wait for the movie !!!
B008133MDK|5.0|Okay, that's probably a bit of an overstatement, as I don't watch much television, so how would I know?  But I don't watch much because most of it is utter garbage, and increasingly so.  I'm looking for something I can re-watch, something that makes me think, but doesn't elate me or depress me.  I don't need visuals to get emotional;  I prefer them to suggest ideas to consider.  That you too?  If so, and if you haven't seen it yet, dive into this series.  The only one I'm not overly partial to is the Hounds episode.  It's not bad;  I just haven't found myself wanting to go back to it, like I have with the others.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Our DVD set of toy story is now complete.  We watch the movies all the time, and love the humor
1596590440|5.0|After working for a company for the last 14 years and starting over this program was a perfect refresher tool for me in a new company.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book was amazing and the second book was just as good.  Even though blood and gore is not my type of book, the first and second book just grabbed hold of me and wouldn't let go.  Love them.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The bear is scary as all get out for young ones.  Oops on our part.<br /><br />The Scottish stereotypes are as demeaning as you'd expect, but like stereotypes satisfyingly familiar (I say this as a Scot).  It's sort of like you feel like you've arrived if Disney or whoever is depicting you, even if they're bludgeoning you at the same moment.  Ah well.<br /><br />Best part?  The utterly feminist workings of the plot where (spoiler alert) she doesn't have to marry anyone in the end, and doesn't have to masculinize herself (okay, a tiny bit at first--but she quickly realizes her mistake there and backtracks) in order to avoid becoming a wife.<br /><br />Of course it does have that weird thing happening to women these days in film where they're made sexy by being given a bow and being ultimately proficient with it, a la Diana (the Goddess, not the demised Princess).  To a certain extent, you become hotter by being a female with a bow and a male with a bristling gun of some sort.  Oye.  But her empowerment here is only accentuated by the prowess with the bow.  It was there in her refusal to be objectified first.  Who gave her that and how it go there is up for further critique.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is fabulous. The first thing that caught me about the game was the music. Usually you expect game music to be corny, but this music is something like a Tim Burton film. Very addictive and I couldn't stop playing for an hour upon purchasing it.
B00AAJQWOY|5.0|it is the best book i have ever read.what a fantastic adventure! Avengers:art of marvel.my father has read the full series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'm not sure if I just got so spoiled on how awesome the first two books were, but this 3rd just didn't take me to the top for the grand finale.  I just expected so much more and was somewhat left feeling, well, not satisfied by the end of the 3rd book.  Also, this book seemed choppy.  It jumped around and it was harder to read and follow.  The book was good, but having gobbled up the first two books, I just expected so much more and was somewhat let down.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I love Diary of a Wimpy Kid books Jeff Kinney is awesome best book ever you rock Jeff Kinney hope to see more
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. From the violence to the love triangle, it is all just so great.<br /><br />Team Peeta forever and always.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie was so powerful and related to the problems between mothers and daughters timeless. The main character is a great role model. Give this to the little girl in your life. Or yourself and find her again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't like blood and guts in books and movies, but this book drew me in and wouldn't let go.  I absolutely loved it!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great book, left me eager to start right away on the next one in the series.  Some wonderfully unexpected surprises too.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|A little too heavy on the musical parts for me. The moral seemed to get lost in the plot. Not as great as Horton hears a who.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The colors are vibrant and the patterns are interesting - fun and challenging game. I would recommend it to friends.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Watched this Christmas Eve while baking cookies with family (3,7,30,56 and 58 year olds). Loved hearing the belly laughs!!<br />Best Christmas Eve  ever🎉🎄🎅😄.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book was different from the first three, in that it is really one book split in two, so you hear mainly about half of the characters in this book, with the other half to be focused on in the next.  Still a good read and lots of great detail and surprises as in the others, I just missed some of the characters.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I found it consistently well written,and gave you a feeling of closer.i  was so thrilled to have one more chance to delve into where this saga was going and enjoy the slightly twisted lives of the charactors injolved.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book, I fell in love with Augustus; his character, his personality I just love loved him. At times this book was just too depressing with the whole cancer situation but still such a great read!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Downloaded it and had him entertained on our 12 hour road trip! Thank God for online gaming! When nothing else to do and you need to kill time this gamer is the one to get! He like it !
B00AH8V0DG|2.0|It was the worst season yet. Tired and lazily written. Seasons 1 though 4 were edgy, funny and always seemed to have a creative direction.<br /><br />This was chocked full of homie slang and thuggery, boring twists and lots of yawns.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong... it had the potential for greatness when Hank got seated next to such a beautiful woman on the plane. Things could have progressed in a very different and interesting direction. But they didn't.<br /><br />Later that day, they conveniently meet up at the thug rapper's mansion. \\"Oh, you again?\\" What a coincidence.<br /><br />Yawn.<br /><br />There are so many more story lines in which Hank's character could have been introduced to such a woman other than the tired \\"watch out for my angry, jealous, gang banger, criminal boyfriend who hired you\\". As if there aren't any other interesting black guy character types.<br /><br />The ending was so terrible I couldn't believe I watched it completely.<br /><br />Hey... it's just a show right? A premium show that I spent hard earned money to buy. I choose what I spend that money on and if Hollywood wants to keep getting that money... I'd recommend putting a little more thought and effort into this stuff.<br /><br />Huge fan... but this season was a real let down. You feel me G?<br /><br />Stupid.
B0035JGYZS|5.0|The picture and sound quality were great. Just like I was watching a BluRay. Cost was a little confusing since the mobile site told me $2.99 and I was charged $3.99. I think maybe I might not have been looking at the HD version on the mobile site. Still good for on the spot movie watching
0756659841|5.0|Kept my son busy for a long time!  We enjoyed looking for each mini fig<br />. We bought another one .

1451695195|1.0|New-age, non-biblical, blasphemous, heresy, worse by far than &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34;, an insult to my spirit, I would recommend and refer potential buyers to buy this instead:  &#34;Biblical Proof Animals Do Go To Heaven&#34;, by Steven H. Woodward
0525478817|5.0|if only I had more time...I would definately read any and everything written by this author. so interesting/immediately sucks you in. goes quickly as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Even though it looks simple and boring I will tell you right now it's not. I LOVE THIS GAME. You try to connect the dots with pipe. The trick is you have to fill the entire board. As the board gets bigger filling the board gets and so does connecting the dots. It is very fun and very addicting. So if you gave this game a bad review then you be too stupid to play the game or just plain stupid.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a good book! Couldn't put it down and finished it in a day.<br /><br />Such a good book! Couldn't put it down and finished it in a day.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Again this was a gift. I was told it would be shipped at a certain date. And I was really worried because it was a birthday<br />gift. But it arrived ahead of time. Thanks.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Deliver was fast and I definitely love the little voice album, I enjoy listening to this album on a rainy day.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you are looking for literature from the likes of Dickens or Shakespeare, this is not your book!  This book is a fun and fluffy read.  I had fun reading it to my husband and he enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is great and I really am very picky with books but I have to say it was good
0399160450|5.0|I collect Clancy books. So I was anxious to get this. It arrived on time and in good condition. And am looking forward to<br />reading it. However it is very think. Hope it snows and I can sit by the fire to read it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I actually watched the black and white version of the movie.  The color version is included in this two disc set however.  The &#34;special features&#34; included really blew me away.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Thought it looked good but I used it one time and it broke. Don't purchase this product it is not work the time or money
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Worked great.  I'm glad I found it.  I would buy it again if I needed it.  This is what I needed. Thanks.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Love the Ho Hey!  Always great to hear an inspiring new group.  Look forward to more good tunes from them.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I watched this movie on tv the other night so wasn't interested in watching again, but I wanted to finally own it because I think it's one of the greatest movies ever and takes me back to when I enjoyed it with my Dear departed Mother.
1451695195|5.0|The book is evidence, as I have experienced in my own life, the Lord loves to use people who are certain they &#34;KNOW&#34; that He does not exist.  Then He simple shows them the truth.  Take the time to read this then seek the Lord.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I spent my time with my cousin. after dinner i just wished to have a nice movie. we both decided to watch this one and at the end we both agreed that we LIKE IT. ;)
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Bosch comes back again in a simple but intriguing whodunit. A very to read traveling companion that will keep you turning pages.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Great photography and instruction, cannot wait for Vol. 2! J.D. knows what you need to see and what you don't to tie effectively.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven<br /><br />It was a good read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Near Death Experince phenomenon.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game!!!!!! And it's great for family time too, when I can't clear a board, I have my husband there to help me
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Cute movie.  Pixar really does a great job.  Rec'd on time and in good condition.  Would purchase more  of these products
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Love this game..... Great graphics, cool story line. Can tel a lot of thought has went into this game.  The writers have done well this time.  Can not wait to see what happens next.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Seen the show so far, reading this for the first time, very good!!!<br />Can't wait to get the next episode. Just awesome
1481207474|5.0|Courtney Milan makes the most positive impression.  Her story is so original it is difficult to put into words the beauty of this work.  Milan looks as though she is going to rank right at the top of the very best authors of romance today.<br /><br />If you see any reviews of this book below a 4-star review - it was probably just not the style of book that person was looking for at that moment.  If they say any part of this story was boring, they were probably looking for a quick romance, not a complex, lovely, developing of relationships.<br /><br />If you want a true romance, originally written and presented, then read this book.  It is beautiful.<br /><br />Things I liked about this book:<br /><br />The Social Conditions of the Period<br />1.  The developing social awareness and social conscience as represented by Clermont.<br />2.  The dramatic changes in transportation as mentioned by Minerva in 15 years - at 8 she traveled to Paris over days.  At 23 she traveled to Paris in a day via trains and steamships.<br />3.  The role of women - the fact they were still property and had no decent means of survival outside marriage.<br /><br />The Love Story<br />1.  I cannot find the words to explore the originality of the story.  It was so very special.  This author was as much focused on the hero as the heroine - making both deeply complex - spending just as much time exploring the inner thoughts of both, but saving enough back to surprise you with their responses so that it takes you a while to make you realize what intellectual matches they are.  Outstanding character development.<br /><br />The Familial Relationships<br />1.  The Duchess - so much more depth than you are first permitted to see.<br />2.  The old Duke - so viciously representative of the misuse of power<br />3.  young Clermont - an abnormal childhood without love<br />4.  Minerva - an abnormal childhood filled with love<br />5.  The aunts - with loving hands a safe cocoon is spun into a steel prison<br /><br />Miscellaneous:<br />1.  The language of the characters denoted the changing language style of Regency to modern.  I enjoyed that very much.<br /><br />2.  The titillating references to sex would be appropriate to the upper classes of the time I believe.  While they may make sexual innuendo, they still hold \\"good women must be virgins if they are to become your wife.\\"  At least what I know of the period seems to support this.  (Always exceptions as we know.)<br /><br />3.  Most reviewers did not mention that the purpose of Clermont's writing of handbills was to discover and expose a criminal misapplication of justice.
B002SYXCVK|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise, because it was what I hoped for with more esoteric selections than is normal, including some British folk music, which was a pleasant change..
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Very interesting concepts and insights that are helpful in finance, but also in life in general, I would definetly recomend it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read a lot of books lately. I'm not sure what I expected but this wasn't it. I loved this book. Refreshingly sweet. I'd recommend to everyone.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|The movie arrived on time and in good condition! I really love this movie! It is full of Steve Martin humor and actions. This is not a typical Jack Black movie, he did a fantastic job!
B0017VT5E8|5.0|A true winner!  A story that will never get old and lose it's impact.  Rocky against all odds shows what we can achieve when we put our heart and soul into being our best.  I love this movie and getting it through Amazon is another plus knowing my  satisfaction is always guaranteed. Thank you Amazon and Thank you Rocky!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child are wonderful when writing together or apart. I look forward to each book and am never disappointed!!
B005LAIH4A|2.0|slow movie, with not a lot of action/entertainment. a real push on the save the trees movement. that was a clear message.
B003OJBWGA|5.0|One of my favorite albums and it sounds even better on vinyl! Support the band and buy it! You won't be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game is fun, but the ads can be annoying.  Nevertheless, free is real good!  You can't go wrong since it's free.  That way you can &#34;try it on&#34; to see if you like it enought to purchase the ad-free game.
B008OUSFVO|5.0|I heard of this woman on NPR, and had to pick up the CD.  It is fantastic.... she has a beautiful voice.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|Had no idea that the academic community of Spain was so progressive before the War. This was an eye opening view of Dali and his early bio in Spain. Beltran and Pattinson were great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was totally into this book. The first book was very good! But as you read the next two it was same thing over and over again and lost my feelings.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|My kids suggested this movie and I didn't think I would like it. I thought oh great an American idol concept for a movie. I found myself laughing throughout the entire movie. Along with all the laughter the singing was good too. I was well pleased a funny movie that my while family could enjoy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think Rowley and Greg are very good characters for that particular book. Keep making more dairies, Jeff Kinney. EPIC.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|most of the app is helpful but we should be able to change steam names and make trades. they should put that into an update.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first book of three. Didn't take me long to get into it and then reading the others made it more complete.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever but it should get updates with redefine you can mine and stuff like railroad tracks but otherwise this game is great I recommend it to people who like to create and disign
B008M34CSI|5.0|ANOTHER ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES  I  HAVE  SEEN ALL YEAR i HOPE THEY HAVE MORE  LIKE IT REAL SOON
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app for ipad used to work well, now it keeps bringing up old stories. Plus, with the last two updates it was supposed to have the chat feature and it never has been there! Somebody needs to create a more workable app for ipad. And I don't like Mypad plus....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was just as good as the other 2. Full of action and intense. I'll probably read them again soon.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Good and gritty movie.  The men in the crowd really liked it.  Story taken from a time when men were men, that's for sure.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|EXCELLENT BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO IS AN ALIEN MOVIE FAN
B004P4S4NM|5.0|It is so nice to hear new artists with some real talent singing a type of music I can relate to. Shear joy. Hope she does more after settling in with her new baby.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading them quite interesting and full of action. It was better than the movies itself. Purchased all 3.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is one of the most funniest games ever. I like it I can't believe this is a free game.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|EXCELLENT ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN ALL YEAR IT SHOULD WIN A SI FY MOVIE OF THE YEAR
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Having missed the first season entirely, after watching 4 seasons and wondering what had gone on in the first season I bought this. What a load of information was in that first season. One of my better buys.
B0071MV540|2.0|I couldn't see it for any length of time. Service was bad. So, I wasn't able to use it at all.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Once you get used to this app it is ok. I like that you can see so many pins on one screen on the kindle app but it is rather inefficient to pin. The iPhone app allows you to pin of the main screen whereas the kindle app forces you to tap the screen, hit the repin button, select the folder to pin to and then hit repin again. Then you have to hit the back button toget to the main screen again. It is not a enjoyable to usr as the iphone app. When you want to see your pins you also need to go through several awkward annoying steps. Kindle should take some notes from the iPhone app to streamline this one
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|love JGL but this wasn't a great movie for him. The plot seemed to focus entirely on types of bikes which is probably appealing to cyclists but not so much to me.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Very cool app; graphics are rich and detailed. Runs smoothly. Watching the planes and ships moving about is very interesting to see.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|An interesting book and also purchased the DVD. Changed a lot of how I was thinking and how to process. I've read this book several times and has given me different aspects of using my thoughts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book. Original story and great characters. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series
B009YDAUJ0|5.0|To start of this show is the best show I have ever seen! Its the only show I watch on TV. The Walking Dead has a great story and great actors. But just to put his out there you can watch this for FREE on demand.
B009369Z8A|4.0|The cinematography is amazing in this film.  Tom Hardy did an excellent and believable portrayal of Forrest.  I liked it so much that I got the book from the library and read it.  It is a part of history that involves bootlegging and prohibition that this film is not afraid to show the violence of the law.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is an incredible writer. I loved this book more than Bared to You. Bared was great but this one left you wanting more. Can't wait till the 3rd book in this series comes out.
B000ID37KO|5.0|Purchased for my sister for Christmas-she ecstatic.  Such a great old classic. She's wanted it for her video library for a long time.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This would have to not only be the best Disny film in history....but also the best movie in history aswell! There is so much Disney magic in this film and its a must-watch for anyone! Lion King has made its way into my heart and I think that you should show this film to all your kids!
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun to play, but i dont like the fact you have to pay for stuff that you can earn instead
B0084IHVGG|5.0|DVD arrived wrapped new.  CD new condition.  My niece was very pleased.  Case was in perfect condition as it should be because it was new.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|it was a good movie, but once was enough. I wouldn't really want to watch it again. If you like family guy and that kind of humor its worth watching though.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I say little, but this is actually bigger than I thought it would be!  Very easy to put together, and a great bang for your buck!  This will get hours and hours and hours of play from my daughters who are in LOVE with this great doll house!
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Good Statham action movie inculding some great fight scenes, gun shoot outs, plus mutiple scenes of things blowing up.  This is a remake of an older movie of the same title, but I agree with other pople still packs a punch worth of doing over again meaning it keeps up with the original movie.  It is a movie you can watch from start to finish without being bored part of the way threw the movie.  So if you enjoy your action movies, pretty decent plotline, plus mutiple scenes of fighting, shoots outs, and buildings being blown up then pick this movie up and enjoy a good action flick for a night of peace quiet and a movie.
B009VL28W2|5.0|real good concert i love it , i bought for my self iy looks real good in hd real happy
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The fact that it doesn't cost anything makes it all that much better!  Thanks to the people at Buffalo Studios!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I loved the first book,so I was extremely excited to read this one. I couldn't put it down and it was wonderfully written. I remember feeling such strong emotions while reading this book that I had to put it down and remind myself that it was just fiction. However, while I have not read the whole series, I don't know how everything turns out, I will say that the entire situation of Clary being in love with her brother was rather difficult to take in. While you can see that Clary and Jace had strong feelings for each other, and you can't help but want them to be together, the incestuous relationship is hard to read at times. However, that does usually work to the author's advantage by making the reader think and by blurring the lines to provoke the readers thoughts. With that in mind, as well as the excellent and enthralling writing style as well as the intense and well crafted storyline, I'll give this book four stars. Now I can't wait to read the next one!
B008PNBU30|5.0|This new Three Days Grace Transit of Venus album is a great rock album with many powerful lyrics in each and every song they wrote for the album.  When it comes to music I either buy it for the music, the lyrics, or both depending on the band.  I'll give some examples of how well this band speaks the truth on their music CD's.  Broken Glass song track 12 \\"All we are is Broken Glass.\\"  Track 8 Happiness \\"Happiness at bottom of a bottle...when Real Life is too hard to swllow.\\"  The whole album if you listen to the lyrics you see Three Days Grace paint a picture of hurt, pain, sorrow, suffering, and using things around you to fill the void.  The reason I gave this a 5 star rating is because sure the rock music they put out seems mainstream at times, but the main reason I listen to this band is because of the lryics the lead singer sings and I relate to them.  I also think most of us have related to these lyrics, so listen to the album with an open mind and see how much you end up liking their new album and music.  The cd ends on a positive note wit the song track 13 called Unbreakable Heart \\"It's worth fighting for\\" and \\"Remember who you are\\" which is true you never can forget who you truly are no matter how many people bring you down take away from you.  But also I feel some people don't like the album because people are scared of the truth and seeing this band speak about hurt, love, big dreams in our heads, filling the void with a drink, and once destoryed we turn into \\"Broken Glass.\\"  So in closing take a chance and see if you enjoy it as much as me I listen to it back to back last night and plan to listen to it again least once today.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This CPU Cooler is worth its weight in gold.  My processor is kept cool at all times no matter the stress that is applied.  I Love it
B004LWZWBU|5.0|this movie is fantastic!  We really enjoyed it. It has a great plot, keeps your in interest and has a great ending.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!!!! completely different from what I was expecting. LOVED IT. is a movie I could never get enough of.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Shinedown's The Sound of Madness is another rock album in my collection that I can listen to all 11 tracks all the way threw without getting bored by the music or lryics.  I just got done reviewing Three Days Grace new album so figure do this one while at it.  Shinedown paints another picture of hurt, anger, wanting to be close to the person you care for, having a \\"need another way out.\\"  But like I said with the other band I buy music for the lryics, the music, and or both elements depending on which band I am listening to.<br />I had heard 5 songs off this album on the radio, tracks 1-3, 5-6.  The whole album to me is very good and amazing chorus's with the songs,  but beside the ones I heard off the radio I even enjoy track 7 Sin with a grin, track 10 Breaking inside, and track 11 Call Me.  Altough some people don't enjoy mainstream rock music least give Shinedown chance to show you lryics wise what we all are feeling inside our hearts and minds.  So like I tell alot of people in my reviews of music, listen with an open mind and see if you end up enjoying the music as much as I do with my collection.
075669812X|5.0|The older grandson's got very excited when they saw what this years book was.  Anything to do with Legos or Ninjago's - is always a winner.  It's a good quality book and it comes with a little Ninjago Lego Character.  Fun!!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really enjoy playing this on my kindle! It is very easy and addictive! Glad I downloaded it. The display it crystal clear and concise.<br />Alyssa
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever released from Japan that what was made from Hayao Miyazaki's Career excellences of his movie!
B008AWBQGW|5.0|It is the first CD I bought of Lynyrd Skynyrd and I must say, their music is awesome... I had a friend who saw them live, he recommended me this band...
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is just as funny today as when I watched it the first Christmas it came out.  Makes me wanna go buy a chainsaw and cut down a tree!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I bought this when it first came out.  I also own it on Steam as well.  It is very fun to play and very addicting.  Not only do I play it but my son loves it too.  He stil has a hard time getting pass the first set of day levels but still likes to try. (he is 5)  The zombies make you laugh and the game has lots of replay value even after you beat it.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I chose this rating because it shows you the meanings of a word and because it is hard to under stand like I could not under stand.
B00866JL96|5.0|The movie is spectacular and the fact that I can watch it on DVD and have a digital copy is wonderful!
B0076DELIG|3.0|I love Michael Connelly and even when he's not at the top of his game, he's still good. The Black Box didn't read like the top of his game. It felt dutiful. But I will wait for the next one and hope it's back to top form.
B004SRNH10|4.0|Like the title says this works like it should.  The only thing I dont like about it that I need it.  Why do I need to install another app just to install other apps? but oh well. I dont notice that it is installed and my other apps work so I am happy.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't stop reading it, I finished it in about 6 hours! One of the best books I have read!
B0064W639K|5.0|A must read for any fan of Christopher Nolan 's Batman films. Obviously a huge influence on perhaps the greatest comic book movie of all time, The Dark Knight.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Moves nice and slowly (if you like that sort of thing), yet with plenty of mystery to uncover.  Brings characters alive from another time.
B0058OUJA4|3.0|I got this thinking it would go the Android version of GeoDefense.  It is not.  You can tell they tried to make it like it but have failed in doing so.  The game play is just ok.  Not fun enough to buy the full game.  Is it challenging? yes it is, but is it fun? I would say no.  I played a few games and moved on.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I think this game is entertaining, well built and keeps your attention. You have to think to get yourself through the level instead of flipping through the tiles willy nilly. Once you earn the money through the mini game, you can buy fish and other items for your tank. I love this game and can play it for hours.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This was a game I was highly anticipating since I first heard it was being made. I had played Flower at a friend's house a long time ago and enjoyed it greatly, so Journey was something I was more than willing to check out since it was from the same makers.<br /><br />WOW. My first impression was that this game was beautiful. The visuals made my jaw drop to the floor and had me immersed in a world I had never been to before. It was almost like something out of a dream.<br /><br />As I journeyed on (no pun intended) I came to feel that I cared for the character I was playing as. It was a true experience seeing everything the character has to go through to reach their destination.<br /><br />It helps that you can't tell whether the character is male or female, since it helps make you feel that YOU are the one taking the journey yourself.<br /><br />When I reached the end... I was filled with a mix of emotions. Sadness and happiness at the same time got to me. It's a feeling I hadn't ever felt over a game that I played on a console.<br /><br />It left me feeling a sense of wonder. I was left thinking about how there are actually some out there taking real journeys to fulfill their own lives.<br /><br />By far one of the best experiences of my life.
B00007E8UG|5.0|This is just an incredible CD, extremely well produced! Diana Krall is fantastic on this record-as always!<br />The sound on this SACD is just amazing, so clean, so much detail!!!!!<br />Just to warn out, the SACD version doesn't play on normal cd players!<br /><br />definitely an audiophile record as well!<br />Highly recommended!!
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|I have a 52 inch plasma tv got a picture of about the size of a 25 inch tv borders on all 4 sides very bad! If this is how on demand thru amazon is going to be never order again will go and buy the blue ray this weekend,what a waste of money and time,very very unhappy!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This will help me alot for ELA class and i would be able to look up any word I want
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought the game because I wanted to get the most out of my purchase - a gift for my two girls.  I really didn't think it might catch their attention, but at least I got the game because so many people loved it, so I thought ok why not.<br /><br />My impression and thoughts were, &#34;Nah, it might get too boring and they'll just toss it in the abyss of our hall closet like the monopoly game&#34;<br /><br />I didn't play the first time around with the thought that &#34;eh, you guys play, so I can do some chores in peace&#34;, but it seemed afte their game, they had a real interest in it.<br /><br />So I decided to play the second round.  Oh my! How I was so wrong!  I got so competitive so easily that I think I turned the kids off.  I had a lot of fun  and I am glad I got it.<br /><br />Next time I have a strategy to place my settlements where I have the greatest odds of getting lots of resources.  I am going the get the most points next time.  Mwaaahahaaha!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This story shows that no matter what you lokk like or who you are, you can do anything. Great for girls.
B000YKE87W|5.0|This is an excellent recording of fairly standard romantic arias by a very fine international tenor.  I was impressed with his on stage performances at the Met in New York.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|Okay, so this is a break-up record but don't assume Norah has gone all Taylor Swift on us. Working closely with Danger Mouse, Norah Jones has asembled a tuneful and subtle collection of songs that is both mature and direct. It's one of those records that you listen to all the way through, something nearly lost in this day and age. What's really driven her music forward is how she's combined her emotive, breathy vocals, which possess those sorrowful &#34;blue&#34; notes that drive home the heartbreak of her lyrics, with DM's modern production. Embracing organic and electronic instrumentation throughout, LBH's is a true revelation, exciting and reflective in equal amounts. If there is one complaint, it's that the tandem found a sound so satisfying that they stuck with it all the way through. That adds to the consistency of the music but it limited the sonic scope. No matter, though, considering the quality of the tunes. Ultimately, it's no small feat to remain as popular as Norah Jones has over the past decade. What's more encouraging is that the artistry of her music continues to grow in leaps and bounds.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|keeps you thinking as you move into the higher levels...challenges even early on though but allows you to go back and master what you have done
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood at his best! We watched it as a family for Christmas and it was fantastic! A great watch.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It wasn't the best written book but an awesome story from sparks. He has a way with story lines that doesn't disappoint
B000HKW7E0|1.0|I can't tell you how disappointed we all were by this.  Everyone says it's just such a classic, but the three of us all agreed it was really lame.  A couple of chuckles and that's it.  Rampaging squirrels and exploding sewer gas?  That's all ya got?  No where near as good as Caddy Shack, Ghostbusters, Planes Trains and Automobiles, etc.
0345501292|5.0|Well worth the money...gorgeous pictures, tons of text, a very complete book. For my son for Christmas, and he loved it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is the best. Great read, fast paced. If you haven't read any if his books, start with 1st and wiry your way through,  you won' t be sorry.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's Pinterest, only on your Kindle.  A great app adaptation of a relatively simple but addictive website.  I thoroughly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a really good book.  Holds your attention.  The story line is a little graphic for kids under 12.
0688156819|5.0|I just got this today, its a great buy!<br />I didn't find anything wrong with it at all except for the fact that a pricing sticker was sloppily placed on the back of the book. It was an easy removal, but put a small tear on the back label of the book.<br />If you buy this, I would suggest taking extra care of removing the price sticker if you want to better preserve the book.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Would be a fiver if they either 1) had a separate Facebook Messenger app, or 2) integrated a more usable Facebook Messenger platform directly into this app (my preferred option).  Otherwise, it works great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me reading. I just couldn't figure it out, but even once I did, I still couldn't imagine the end.
B00000I0XW|5.0|I never tire of listening to Sarah Brightman.  Add to her amazing voice these songs that compliment her so well... it is a lovely CD to have.
145210655X|5.0|Got this for my son to give to his Dad for Christmas! It was perfect because it really is funny and he also love Darth Vader!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I read this (like many of the other classics that I got) because I had never read it before.  The story was okay. I know that it is supposed to be a classic, but I found it to be very depressing. But, a lot of the stories written at that time were on the depressing side. I am glad that I read it, but probably would not read it again.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Gripping. Interesting way to use interviews as a method of telling a story. Will be interested in seeing the movie next year.
0937381888|5.0|Awesome book, well written, detailed, great from the notice to the experience home brewer. A superb reference guide that I go back to it over and over again.
B008645YH6|5.0|Electra Heart is such a perfect LP. Marina is gorgeous, her style and music too. I am completely happy with it.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he was thrilled with it. The CDs are great. The book is great to look at.
B007MDB71O|5.0|is because the movie cost about $250 million to make (a lot even by Hollywood standards), and Disney may barely recover the cost.  That's too bad - considering the junk the movie industry produces each year (they were planning a remake of The Wild Bunch - I rest my case), canceling a sequel to this movie is a shame but not surprising.<br /><br />I first read the books many many years ago.  This movie is faithful to the themes and spirit of ERB's Martian series, if not the actual plot.  It's an adventure movie - the special effects are awesome and it's great fun.  The critics are wrong - if you like adventure flicks you'll like this one.
0486278077|1.0|It is just not my kind of book... iT IS ON MY BOOK SHSELLP WITH OTHER BOOKS THAT i HAVE BOUGHT AND FEEL LIKE i MADE A MISTAKES- IN JUDGEMENT.
B0058H8V6K|5.0|Amazing sound! I really liked it this CD. Natalia kills is a talented artist & i hope that more people can listen her.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It wasn't  the best wimpy kid book by far, but it was still great. I didn't think it had that classic wimpy kid humor like usual, and it could of been longer. More humor, and less talk!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love games like this. But u do wish they lasted longer. Or had different story paths so then could be a different story line each play
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I bought this to give to my daughter on her birthday... She loves it and has it on always in her car.. So I have learned to love it too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|An instant favorite, so moving. Brought tears to my eyes.you really fall in love with the characters. Sad story but at the same time uplifting.
B009YU62H2|4.0|It's great to finally have SG back. This album has a wide variety of sounds on it and it doesn't feel forced. It isn't the masterpiece I was hoping for but its way better than having no new SG. Maybe a couple of tours will fire the creativity back up for the group.
1419705849|4.0|All my 3 kids under 9 read it.  They enjoy all the books in the series.  The movies are enjoyable also.
0061900656|4.0|a really good book for bringing home our new baby with our three year old. it he really understood things better and is great with the baby!
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Thank you. The DVD came quick and orderly. It made my sisters day to receive this as a gift. It was just as described.
B0027G6MRU|4.0|I know a lot of fans wanted this to be BOS 2, but cmon. This album has some flaws, but it has some great songs and has a rawness to it that I think was intended.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The storyline moved along and kept me wondering what would happen next. Would recommend this novel for a quick read that is easy to follow.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I loved the original Bourne trilogy.  This one keeps to the action and storyline just fine.  While it did not seem quite as suspenseful and full of action as the originals, it was by no means a let-down.  There are nice tie-ins with the original series, and all-in-all, a great addition to the Bourne series.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I downloaded this camera on my son's Kindle Fire HD.  We took one picture, and the darn thing went blank.  There were no buttons to press to get out of the app for a while, then a notice comes up saying that the app is not working.  Well that was a waste of .99 cents.
B00377Z0Y4|4.0|Another great installment from Tull. I put off getting the album for years because I have all the studio and live albums already and had heard all of the songs that were rerecorded for this collection. While I don't like all of the new versions of some of those songs as much, they work and fit well together on this album. This is a good album, it was nice to have a mix of Christmas music to listen to that wasn't the same thing I've had to hear for the last thirty years.
B00004YB9Y|5.0|I purchased this for my husband.  He has played it over and over ever since it arrived.  Gorgeous music from some of the world's best voices!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Love the cover. Sturdy, but not too bulky and hard. Will use it everyday. Good value. It was a great gift.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|WELL, the game itself is rather great. Although I did have a slight problem, and still I do. When I begin the game it turns upside down and when I adjust it to the right side it does the same thing! Please update it?? I`m playing on a Kindle Fire HE.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Loaded with tons and tons of valuable Financial News, the way only Bloo,berg can deliver it. The App is user friendly and feature loaded. My Kindle HD 8.9 and the Bloomy App go together like butter on my popcorn. Nice!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I purchased this for my husband, who is a huge Andrea Bocelli fan.  He had seen it on PBS and was delighted to have it for his collection.  Simply beautiful music!
0321885139|5.0|The Sketchnote Handbook is a well-crafted and written introduction to the power of visual notetaking. Mike Rhody provides useful techniques and understanding of sketchnoting so that anyone who wants to get started learning how to keep notes in this way can do so. Sketchnoting is not just for artists. Even if your drawing skills are not that great, just using simple line drawings and doodling is enough to get started with sketchnoting.<br /><br />I purchased this video version of the Handbook before the book itself was released. I recommend purchasing the book which gives you access to the online versions of these videos. The videos complement the book very well and allows you to see and hear Mike work and explain his process.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Every informative read if you want to learn the definitions of the words we use every day<br />Suggestive dead for all
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great trilogy... Had me on the edge of my bed each page, each character came to life before my eyes... The way the author worded each and every horrific event made me feel like I was in this horrible place...District 12 Lives On!
B0087HT36U|4.0|Challenge but not impossible, fun and good for passing some time. Would love to see more levels and maybe some additional weapons.
B008FPZQQU|4.0|Well remastered. Good use of all channels. Not as good as Brain Salad Surgery, but passable. Well worth the money
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Epicness to the max though you could use more mlp songs in it but all in all love it and my brony radar is going off
B001DUDKEY|3.0|Great story. The main characters didn't have much chemistry.  Poor casting. Or maybe editing of scenes or takes where you would get some hint they even know eachother.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I been wanting this app but I couldn't get because it was 5$ now its free omg that's so awesome ahh
B0096PAA6E|5.0|A very talented performer. Very intense playing with an interesting mix of styles and song types.But, I do prefer the intense guitar playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|since this is the pocket edition I understand that it is not done but even though this game is AWESOME!!!!!
B00AHSINKO|2.0|I am a big fan of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jone and was extremely disappointed in this movie.  If you this movie is a comedy think again.  Tommy's character is grumpy while Merly's is wimpy..
B009VLX8FS|4.0|It's not like Taylor's other CDs, it's has a very 'pop' flow to it, but I like it.  If you only like her country music, you will be let down.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie is really fun and I definitely recommend renting! You will want to watch it again and probably buy it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We didn't watch this movie when it first came out because the previews didn't leave me thinking I wanted to see it. A daughter asked for it for Christmas.  Turns out it's a fantastic movie, great entertainment.  Among other things, the artists did an incredible job with the young lass's red hair.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Movie wasn't too bad.  Don't pay more than $1.99 to rent it.  The acting wasn't too terrible except for the twilight actress.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|Just got this app so I have not played it much.  I feel it will be one that I will play often.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this game at the carnival all the time and this version is just as addicting. I just wish you could accumulate coins faster
B00APUQT7I|2.0|Why is it that often sequels of witty, original animated films get more juvenile as they age into number III and IV? Is it because the producers think the adults are getting bored and that only the kids have the patience to sit through another one?
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Movie wasn't too bad.  Don't pay more than $1.99 to rent it.  The acting wasn't too terrible.  It's worth checking out.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This product fills the void Apple left in it's iPod Nano Touch (square version). I bought the Nano to wear as a watch and to provide my music to both bluetooth headphones as well as my bluetooth Sound Dock. Imagine my disappointment when I realized there is no Bluetooth integrated into the Nano. I looked around and came up with this. Yes, it gets its power from the Nano, so playtime is shortened, but the ability to go wireless overshadows that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Pretty cool except its kinda hard to get points and new games. I wish it was easier. The games, at least a few of them, seem too kidish. I wish they weren't. I would get it again, but it's not something I'd spend money on.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Too bad if we don't see Matt Damon again.  These are a great way to be able to enjoy the continuity that flows from one movie to another, and the price is very good.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Movie wasn't too bad.  Don't pay more than $1.99 to rent it.  The acting was kind of terrible and didn't roll into aliens very well.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|this item works as intended, stopped the overheating and even had enough left over to finish a few more jobs, and also came fast :)
B00979CS50|4.0|Whenever Neil Young gets the itch to team up with \\"The Horse\\", you know you're in for a treat. After a nine year span between Crazy Horse albums and 16 years between a Crazy Horse album with the full lineup (discounting Americana), the team is back together to deliver one of their best. While this is not the best \\"Horse\\" album Neil has released, it is quality from beginning to end.<br /><br />\\"Driftin' Back\\" - The album opens with the 27+ minute epic \\"Driftin' Back\\". Not my favorite track on the album, but worth a listen. It never feels  to drag. The lyrical content ranges from Neil talking about getting a \\"Hip hop haircut\\" to his disdain for MP3s. The song feels very much like a first take jam in which Neil is just singing whatever he comes up with off the top of his head. (3 of 5 stars)<br /><br />\\"Psychedelic Pill\\" - This song is very much a newer version of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" 40+ years later. Not a bad little 3 minute rocker, but definitely not on par with its predecessor. The phaser effect that Neil uses on this cut I could live without, but it does not interfere with the song too much. I actually prefer the alternate take to this song. (2 of 5 stars)<br /><br />\\"Ramada Inn\\" - To me this is the best song off the album, and maybe the best song Neil has released in the last decade. The song is basically the story of an old married couple dealing with the trials and tribulations of marriage and the effects of alcohol on the marriage. The guitar playing in this song is simply phenomenal and some of the best that Neil has ever done. Rolling Stone magazine named this the 5th best song of 2012 and for once it seems as though they actually got something right. Clocking in at 16+ minutes, there is not one second that I would cut off. (5 of 5 stars)<br /><br />\\"Born in Ontario\\" - Yet another autobiographical tune by Neil. Nice opening riff and overall just a loose feeling cut from the Horse. I feel a lot of similarities to the song \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\" here. Not so much the lyrical content, but just the feel of the song. (3 of 5 stars)<br />\\"Twisted Road\\" - This is a rather interesting song. Neil sings about hearing \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" for the first time, listening to the \\"Dead\\" and the first time he saw Roy Orbison. On the tour accompanying the album, Neil is playing this as a solo acoustic song, but here it is played \\"plugged in\\" with the entire band. It seems many people have preferred the acoustic version, but I actually like this version better. I have a feeling this song will remain in the set list for quite some time. (4 of 5 stars)<br /><br />\\"She's Always Dancing\\" - This is another long Crazy Horse jam. Liken this to \\"Like a Hurricane\\". Very similar feels to the songs. Once this gets going you are in for a treat. This is a great example of how Neil can draw a listener in and make an 8 minute song feel like a 3 minute song. (3 of 5 stars)<br /><br />\\"For the Love of Man\\" - I've not quite been able to figure out how this song made it on this album. It has just seems to have a completely different feel from the rest of the album. That is of course to not take anything away from it as it seems to be one of the most heartfelt songs Neil has ever written. For anyone who doesn't know, Neil has a son named Ben who has a pretty severe case of Cerebral Palsy. This songs is written for and about his son. I believe that this song was written sometime in the `80s and versions of it have floated around for years. I'm glad that it finally made its way onto an album, I'm just not sure why it was this one. It would have fit nicely on Silver and Gold in my opinion. Still just a beautiful, touching song. (3 of 5 stars)<br /><br />\\"Walk Like a Giant\\" - One word to describe this song would be \\"Epic\\". At over 16 minutes and closer to 25 minutes in concert, Neil lets it all out. He sings of how he use to walk like a giant and how that has changed. Neil seemed to change his outlook on life after his aneurism around 2005 and it seemslike he no longer feels invincible. The song just grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go the entire time. The ending of the song contains a long coda of nothing but feedback, distortion and Ralph Molina pounding on the drums to give you the sense of a giant taking over. The sounds seems straight out of a horror movie. Twenty years from now, people will look back at \\"Walk Like a Giant\\" the same way they look at \\"Cortez the Killer\\", \\"Down by the River\\", \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" and \\"Like a Hurricane\\". It will go down as a timeless classic. (5 of 5 stars)<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of Neil with the Horse and enjoy long jam sessions this album is for you. If you listen to this albums expecting \\"Heart of Gold\\" or \\"Old Man\\" type songs you may be disappointed. This album is somewhere between a 3 and 4 star album, but because its Neil and he is my all-time favorite artist, I went with the 4. Neil has proven that even in his advanced age, he still has plenty left in the tank. Hopefully this is not the end, but the beginning of another chapter in the career of a master artist.like he no longer feels invincible.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|At least it's free.  It looks OK, but we'll see how it is when I actually start to drop my finished book into it.
B009329Y30|1.0|Movie wasn't Good at all.  Don't pay more than $1.99 to rent it.  The acting was kind of terrible. Not a good chick flick.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I wondered where the book was going at the beginning but as the story unravelled I really enjoyed it.  The wonders of the justice system.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great free download. I would recommend it to everyone. My 4 year old nephew showed me how to play it and got me hooked.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|This is one of the best classic movies of all times. A reference for mosical movies history!<br />Out 11-years daughter has selcted it after seeing small parts of the moview at school, and we loved it!!!
B0013KTGAG|4.0|This is an awesome, fun  movie!  It's got some vaguely scientifically accurate parts to it, and the rest is pure hard core sci-fi!  Though movie has awesome production values to it, a compelling story and some good characters.  This is one of my most favorite sci-fi films in a very long time!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Recommended by Amazon and not sure I was going to like the whole disc. I love the whole thing and glad to be a new fan.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I wasn't going to put a calculator on the kindle but found myself out with the kindle but forgot my phone.  I needed a calculator.  was glad that I found one that was the same as the one on my phone
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book.  We read it together and he's totally into it.  If you like Ninjago this book is great to explain and go into detail on the characters and gear.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|It works as described. It's magnetic, so it stays on the charger and no need to take it off. The fruity price tag is as usual a little high for my liking, but that's not news to anyone, is it?
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Overall this is a good movie.  Fun and entertaining.  But I am not sure if it is as good as the other Bourne movies.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|this site is useful on my kindlc.  It is fast and easy to use.  it is much better than firefox or chrome
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Fast moving plot, plenty of action and laugh out loud humor.  All of the character development worked.  It helps to see the other movies for the individual Avenger characters but not necessary.
B006RXQC2Y|1.0|The movie production is a 5 star<br />The source material that was provided to Amazon to be streamed as HD was VHS quality.<br />This is not due to band-width limits.<br />I called Amazon and they are looking into this.<br />Amazon gets high marks for customer service for responding to this.<br />They refunded my purchase cost, (and I did not even ask).<br />They promised to give a good honest look at this case.<br />Kuddos to Amazon.<br />But until the source quality is addressed, you will be looking at SD quality in SD
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I did not expect much, but this was a real surprise.  It's a good movie.  Very entertaining.  Watched it twice to pickup some of the little details I missed the first time around.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|this is a game I have played on various devises for years.  have always enjoyed it  this version for the kindle is no different
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an inspiring story of two people fight others two the death just two get food for their sector.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love it! just happy that I can see the links and pictures bigger and better than on my phone. happy
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is amazing - I had never read it before even though the movie is one of my favorites. I can understand why it probably wasn't possible to make the movie to follow the book exactly, but it would be interesting to see it done now with the special effects they can do. I'm looking forward to reading more.
B0051ANPZQ|2.0|I loved the start of this book. I did. The shifts in narration created a mystery. So did the concern over August's acceptance. But when the major two problems were solved half way through, the rest of the book let me down. It was like a diary of awesome events in someone's life. No tension or action. Well just a smidge. My advice, read half the book, and then stop.
159420411X|5.0|Great intro read on statistics.  After the 2012 election it is obvious that more people could use a better understanding of statistics.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I liked the Graphics and the ease of selection of cards. The Automatic Function of placing card is something new and easy to fet used to.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great new story line to the Bourne series. I have read all the books and these are always non stop action and intrigue.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really love this game. I love all the animals. I love the graphics. What isn't there to really love about this game!!!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Great movie. It tell me I need eighteen more words in here so I'm adding more words to make them happy.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It was quite interesting,with many different scenarios to play, Enjoyable. Mahjong is one of the Better mind games that enhances the intelect.
B008N1V11U|5.0|If a girl is reviewing a game that is specifically for guys you know the game is awesome and it is  the best time to get this game because it's on sale for 99&cent; I love this game
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I got 2 of the Perplexus Epics.  One for my 15 year old daughter and one for my 70 year old father.  My daughter would pick it up, get frustrated and put it down....couple minutes later I could hear her trying it again.  This went on all day!  My dad who is a retired engineer was curious from the start but looked at it completely differently.  However, he would pick it up, get frustrated and put it down...couple minutes later I coull hear him trying it again.  I think it will be a love/hate battle for both but as far as I am concerned, it was just what I was going for!  If you can't drive your family a little insane every once in a while....it is just not fun!<br /><br />I have not done a lot of business with Amazon in the past, but my experience was superb and I will not think twice about purchasing through them in the future!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of those books I couldn't put down. If you are fan of non-fiction stories of life, love and family Fearless is a must read. Not just a book for a military minded person, its a story of life.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Ok well liked this book but it just felt shorter and like it had less story line than the other diary of a wimpy kid books
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Didn't get it at first...I thought the beginning dragged, when in fact, it was setting the stage...this book tugs at the heart...worth the read
B003ODIZL6|3.0|To me this is a good dictionary I would send this to many of my college buddies.<br />I can't wait to read it again.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if it was free I didn't buy it but I did on my moms ipad and I refuse to buy it for 1.99 so if you want more people to buy it then make it free PLEASE ;) :)
B005C6HGSG|5.0|Honestly thought I was going to have to force myself to finish this, that it'd be dry writing about monsters I'd already seen Sam and Dean fight. But in the end I didn't. Learning about Bobby 's past and what made him, well, him, amazed me with how well it tied in with and supported the show. I especially loved how the whole thing sounded like Bobby, and even Dean. It was really great! And in the end, gotta love Bobby Singer!
1451695195|5.0|This book is probably the best on this topic that anyone could ever find!  I will order more and recommending it to friends.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|So, Ender's game is a completely different book, yet it's not.complete without this book. I personally preferred the corridors of battleschool which kept me furiously turning pages. However, this piece had me enthralled in a different manner. Ender' s intelligence seemed to serve him in a new way, but it was somehow the same in a beautifully accurate way.<br /><br />The story was a bit hard to follow at times if you were not paying very close attention, because of the sheer volume of characters. I accredited this to the lack of description in character, which ironically is what Olson Scott Card mentioned in the introduction. Yet, this was the same lack of description I felt with Ender' s Game. Instead of an in-depth detail of the characters physical appearances you got quite the opposite. Very ambiguous descriptions made it hard for the character to be any different from one another. However, this lack of description might have been intentional to allow the readers to picture the characters however they liked.<br /><br />The action is this book is centered around mysteries and societal conflicts which is very easily related to. It made for a great read trying to figure out the mysteries along with Ender and Jane. All in all definitely necessary to read if you enjoyed Ender' s Game!!!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Like most movies, this doesn't hold a candle to the book. As a stand alone movie I think it's a pretty good action flick. Die hard fans of the book (like me!) will be disappointed by some of the changes & omissions in the story line. I don't think they did a very job of explaining some important elements of the history & society or even the politics of the world the movie's based in. I found myself needing to expand on & explain a lot of things to my husband (who hasn't read the books) and he enjoyed the movie more after understanding the backstory & the world a little better. The cinematography does a fantastic job of conveying the characters emotions & disorientation, but I think the movie fails to grab you emotionally. I didn't feel anything for the characters like I did whilst reading the books.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Even my eight year old<br />son plays it with us and enjoys it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun you will enjoy it it's a great game to play because it's a thinking game
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm glad I ordered when I did, great price and arrived when expected.  My son was suppose to watch this with my cousin (one of the victims) the night of the shooting, but didn't.  So he's going to watch it now at home.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am a new Kindle user, but already I'm hooked. Got the cover and screen protector at a great price (Amazon local deals). Now that I have another local deal burning a hole in my pocket coupled with the fact that my children have taken a liking to the kindle, am considering a 2nd case. After reading all the reviews on other covers, including the bad ones on this case, still opting to buy another Microshell. Though the colour selection is limited, I can't imagine a sturdier case for my new toy!
B005HSL626|4.0|How you play this game is you try to slice all the fruit and if you hit a bomb then the game is over or if you get three x then the game is over if you do classic. For arcade if you hit a bomb then it takes away 10 points. If you do Zen mode there is no bombs. It's a great game to play. It's really fun.
030746363X|1.0|Buy the book - you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Love the positive reviews the book gets. Each negative review gets nice, warm, well written comment. Nuts! Well done PR!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read the book in 2 days during Christmas vacation!! I've already purchased the second book and can't wait to start it!!
B008M721MS|4.0|Skype, once again, doesn't disappoint. Received my Kindle Fire HD today as a Christmas gift & downloaded Skype within the hour. Skyped with one of my BFF's & no problem.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Absolutely the BEST series I have ever watched My son turned  me on to this series, thank goodness!  LOVE IT
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked the point of view it was told in and all the descriptions. I liked the action with a hint of romance. It was the perfect mix of the two.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|I purchased this for my nephew, who was very excited to open it.  My husband and I put it together, inserted batteries and tried to get it to fire.  The bullets kept jamming.  We took it apart, even the batteries, and tried again.  Still did not work.  The bullets all get jammed and the power action that is supposed to fire them out does not seem powerful enough to actually shoot the bullets very far. We eventually got a few bullets to come out, but they dribbled out.  He was very disappointed (as were we).  Looks like we either got a lemon or there is a design flaw.
B003097ABA|5.0|Everything I hoped it would be, good value for 5 albums! Well recorded and has stood the test of time. Good cd to add to any collection.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I guess I kind of expected an answer from this friend that he was writing too but I like how there never was one. It impressed me and I definitely recommend this book for all ages.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It's a strategy game that's not hard but you have to think about what to do next, I really enjoyed it! Just wish it was longer
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Adding a full orchestra to what is already is the best band in the world was a nice touch. They sound just as good live as they do in the studio. Great cd for any Floyd fan.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I say not as realistic because in the first three Bourne movies Matt Damon played a part that was more believable.<br />Jeremy Renner portrays one of a group of &#34;super&#34; agents having super human abilities. So while it was a fun watch it was over the top for me as far as believability goes.<br />If you have not seen the first three Bourne movies you won't have a good idea of what's going on in this one.<br />The first three films while making the agaents look nearly superhuman were still more or less believable. The things they did seemed more or less possible. But 'Legacy' goes well into the realm of SiFi.<br />Again However - it was a fun watch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app; I use it 80% of the time; I have never had a problem. I just love it. Everyone. should have this one.
B0036FOGTW|3.0|While the ideas are interesting, the writing leaves a lot to be desired. It reads like a Doctoral thesis. It is hard to wade through it.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I enjoy this album very much. It's delightful to listen too. I listen to it often. I say buy it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My four year old loves to play this game, every chance he gets. He plays it on my Kindle Fire and on my cell phone. Thank You.
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|Scientists are beginning to prove what Energy Healing Practitioners have known. Bruce Lipton effectively shares the science behind why Thetahealing is so powerful and effective.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|it works, except for the tiny tab that should  support it when turned into a stand. be sure to get screen protectors as well.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|So, I finally got around to watching the 2012 remake......<br />Not directly comparable with the original, although (as many other reviewers point out in depth) there are a number of recurring moments, characters & nods.........There are some great ideas in the movie - although the dystopian future seemed in places a slight touch Bladerunneresque (that could be me, though, homing in on the umbrellas and clear raincoats....)...and whether or not this effects-driven effort will hold up well over time is debatable.....<br />Everyone's an expert, so I won't attempt an indepth movie analysis (or remember it for you wholesale) - I'll just keep it general.... I thought I got my $3.99's worth watching it online.......IEM's (JH Audio Pro 16's do make a difference) & a laptop ......I think I would have felt a bit let down shelling out $18-odd dollars at Imax (whereas watching Prometheus on the big-big screen was definitely money well spent)..........Overall, I'd give Total Recall (2012) three and a half stars...but I couldn't find the 1/2 star button!
0374533571|5.0|this book is great.i can not wait to go see the movie.i have plans to go see the movie this weekend.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like the whole angry birds series but this one was a little boring to me. I still downloaded it and i have completed it but once you finish it, that's it. there isn't much to do after that.
B000FGGE5Y|5.0|i got this movie for my sister.she loves milla jonovich and so do i.this movie is really good and thats why i got it for my sister
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I like the concept of the game and it requires you to think of how to figure out the puzzles and how to move on to the next level. I really enjoyed playing it, but I was able to finish it in a day. I hope they come out with another one soon because I really enjoyed it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This product was a great gift for my boyfriend, and he was thrilled to receive it especially since he didn't know it was on DVD yet. He had the hardest time finding the first Expendables when it had come out so I eventually ordered it off Amazon for him, so finding the second one was just perfect. My only issue with this item was I paid for a 3-5 day shippment and it took well over a week to receive it...very frustrating. But overall the item itself is great.
B008NMT684|4.0|I got this for my son and he really likes the app. I need to get him the full version though because this one only comes with a few puzzles to do. My son loves trucks and puzzles so i knew this would interest him.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book is crazy and suspenseful but I loved reading every page! Definitely recommend to those who liked Gone Girl by the same author!
B001LF2WCC|3.0|I didn't notice much of a difference between the blu-ray and regular dvd. I still like this movie and have watched it several times.
B009H442DG|1.0|Is this a \\"Saturday Night Live \\" skit? Travolta speaks/sings with no discernable talent. Even my grandmother, a forgiving Christian, would hate this. Newton-John and Travolta actually listened to this and let it be released anyway?
B009MF56GC|4.0|I never give a 5...nothing is perfect after all! It was a well done, fun follow-up movie, wall to wall action with a liberal dose of humor thrown in (does not take itself at all seriously!).
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is pretty good on kindle fire. It could use improvements. It's a little hard to navigate but to be fair it may get easier as I get more use to using it. No major complaints.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Love this movie! The picture and 3D graphics look great on our TV. My daughters and I enjoyed it a lot.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Really a great movie. One of the better animated pictures to have come out in the last couple of years. It can be a little intense for the little ones at times, but we definitely made a wise choice buying it.
B008J34466|5.0|I love the new Album. Am a recent fan and this is one of the best yet. Keep them coming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|EXCELLENT GAME, I CANT PUT MY KINDLE DOWN AND WHEN IT DIES I GO TO MY PHONE. JUST LOVE IT.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is extremely fun and, in my opinion, better than angry birds if you are looking for a time killer. The game requires you to think, but it also allows you to be creative. I would reccomend it to both angry birds fans and non-angry birds fans alike!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I am such a hugh Susan fan, and this more than fulfilled my expectations. I enjoyed her duet with Michael Crawford, but her duets with Donny Osmond were outstanding.<br /><br />Even if you are new to Susan Boyle, this is a must.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Why is a review required in the middle of my book it's rather annoying I say.that's all I'm at 25 percent
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book after hearing countless raves about it and have to say that it was quite disappointing.  The writing was excellent and the two perspectives really kept me interested but the ending was so depressing that it ruined the whole book for me.  I was waiting for a real &#34;gotcha&#34; and the final twist fell ironically flat.
B005LAII12|4.0|I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE IT WAS NOT AS FUNNY AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I LOVE SETH MACFARLENES WORK BUT NOT THE BEST.<br />I LIKED THE MOVIE,IT WAS A GIFT FOR A GUY. SO IT WAS DEF WORTH GETTING.<br />I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO OLDER AUDIENCES AND PEOPLE WHO LIKE FAMILY GUY KINDA SHOWS
B008ELUEQC|5.0|His first xmas cd...<br />I'm a big fan so I'm glad he finally did one. If you like him you will love it.
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|As always Mila and crew for this movie were stupendous! I couldn't help feeling I was watching a video game ,more than a movie when she went through the various mock cities underground and I found it befuddling that after all the energy she expended to finally escape was I presume just normal human effort,until she was re-injected with the virus and thus reattained her other powers. Of course they leave you hanging at the end again so this franchise clearly is not going anywhere soon. But it looks like its going to take a massive effort on the part of virtually all survivors on the planet to resolve where the movie ends. But then that's what they did the last time!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Nice to see Taylor is finally evolving into a well rounded singer.  In the beginning, everything she did sounded the same to me.
B00004THAY|5.0|I ordered two of these CD for Christmas presents.  My husband loves Eric Clapton and he really liked the CD.  B.B. King is wonderful as well!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've played this game on multiple platforms starting with the Wii and have loved it on every one.  If you like puzzle games then this one is for you.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I ordered this CD as a Christmas present for myself this year and really liked it.  I love all the songs on it.  Wow!  Adele has a wonderful voice!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie and franchise. Enjoyed all of them equally and sad to see the final edition. Fantastic movie! Very creative and great selection of actors.
0805092447|5.0|I ordered this book for my grand daughter.  This is a wonderful book that all children should own.  Very repetitive and children can read along with you.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Very handy for those of us that love WOW but want a cheaper alternative that is just as fun! No real problems here!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love one. direction #niallsfuturewifewitches lol lol lol lol lol lol this is the cool app ever love it random #ihatetaylorswift
B005K17RU0|4.0|I wanted it so I could keep more than one place at my fingertips.  It does that without to much trouble.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Absolutely eye-opening book for anyone who doubts there is a Heaven waiting for us!  If you could only read one book this year, make it this one.
B008602KQI|5.0|I ordered this DVD as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter.  It arrived in plenty of time and the cost was great.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Fun game that is a lot like dragonvale and I also enjoy that game too!!!!!!! Hope other people can enjoy it like I do.
1423140605|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter for Christmas but couldn't wait to give it to her so she got it early.  I love shopping online so I don't have to fight the crowds.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I love it. An excellent book. A must read book for every software developer or software architect. Very much recommended
B00275EHJG|5.0|I ordered this Disney movie as a Christmas gift.  It arrived in excellent condition and the price was inexpensive as well.
B0095R64AO|4.0|It is funny and unpredictable. Good entertainment for a couple alone night.<br />I would recommend it.<br />Get married soon people...five years is too long
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters and even before it came out, I could tell I was going to love it. Although I am not sure where exactly it is filmed, the cinematography is beautiful and with every scene I wish I was there. This movie covers every emotion, happiness, sadness, humor; It is so great. To be honest, I would only thing a man would like this if he is somewhat sensitive and has feeling because if you are numb to those you wont enjoy it. The acting is amazing too.<br /><br />I have watched it about 7 times and could watch it 7 more. Buy it.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|it gives all the protection and keeps functionality.  I bought it for the wife and she is very happy with it
B0042MEQVG|3.0|I have never been a fan of the twilight movies because that acting is so bad in all of them, so I can not really enjoy the movies. The books are great, but i am not a fan of the movies. You might be better off just leaving your imagination up to itself and not having it ruined by the awkward characters in the movies.<br /><br />I would not re-watch.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is like Bejeweled but I find it more entertaining.  The harder levels do require more thought and planning but are not impossible.  I was especially happy to find out that when I completed the &#34;tour of the ancient world&#34;, the game started over but at a more difficult level.  Hooray ... I get to lose more time playing this game.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my daughters boyfriend & he loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was generally mildly entertaining with a couple laugh out loud moments.  It's better than most of what's coming out as a &#34;comedy&#34; lately, but far from a comedic masterpiece.<br /><br />I wouldn't watch it again and might...might recommend to a friend.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my daughters boyfriend & he loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i like thi sgame bc its fun and addicting without being overly complicated like many games tend to be. i just want something simple to busy myself during downtime. this does that
B0013FSL3E|5.0|was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my daughters boyfriend & he loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|love it..my hubby. my son and I love it. so far I have been happy with my purchases. happy with shipping and everything
B0002IQJUK|5.0|was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my daughters boyfriend & he loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I like shopping at Amazon in the comfort of my home.  You all seem to have all things in stock and ready to be delievered -<br />ON TIME !!!!!  Thanks for the smiles through the years. L.S.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy using this program. You can vary the game through settings. I just wish I had the option of paying for it on the Kindle to avoid ads, even if most let you skip to the game.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Hello  from L.S.  -  Every thing came in on time.  all disc's were in very good condition Thank you for having a hugh<br />inventory of all things needed..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|As is 9 out of 10 times the books are better than the movie. So if you enjoyed the movie, you will LOVE the books. They are so much better and full of emotion and gets you closer to the characters than the movie. If you havent seen the movie and you want an exciting story with action, imagination and emotional ups and downs get this!
B00441GYZQ|5.0|Love , Love  the movie very different for Harrison Ford.  I have watched this movie over and over. Great actiing and setting.<br />I was so glad that you all still had it , but of course your Amazon.  I almost forgot to say that the packaging was very<br />good and on time !!!  I have now earned my frequent  Smiles  !!!!  ha ha  L.S.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you are looking for a humorous and heartfelt book, seriously get this! I'm going to have my daughter read it as well. Its such a great story, makes you laugh out loud, have tears in your eyes, but really makes you think about life as well. I dont give reviews that talk too much about a book, but dont read too many of the detailed reviews or you will find lots of spoilers.<br />  John Green must be a special person to have done such a wonderful &#34;fictitious&#34; story so well.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is very entertaining, fun, lots of action, a very cool game from a kid point of view, coupled with a bit scary.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I expected more seeing as it was a Panasonic exclusive for so long!<br />It's good 3d but it didn't blow me away.<br />The 3d in the wide angle shots is almost nonexistant, plenty in close ups though.<br />The story sucks if you're familiar with american history and the character, scenery and minor plot points are is suspiciously close to Final Fantasy X!<br />I only purchased this for what I thought I was missing.
B005ZUR724|1.0|NO LO PUEDO CREER..UNA SEMANA SIN PODER JUGAR..POR QUE NOS ASEN ESTO ...GAMELOFT...<br />NO LE HARAN EL UPDATE A LA KINDLE FIRE???PORQUE. PORQUE??? YO JUGABA MUY AGUSTO AQUI...POR FAVOR AGAN HALGOOOOOO....
B004RGHWIQ|4.0|I also have the Coraline 3d anaglyph version and found it to look maybe a tad bit more immersive than the stereoglyphic version!<br />I figured if the one version looked THAT good the other would be outstsanding, little difference between the two.<br />Don't regret the purchase though.
030759565X|5.0|Bought it for a friend who is a fan of the blog. She was very happy with it. Great photos!
B0060D123K|5.0|This is one of our favorite of The Christmas Carol versions.  Michael Caine does a great scrooge and of course, the Muppets are fun to watch.  The music is so good,too1
B002GU5V24|5.0|This was bought as a christmas present for my brother inlaw by on request of my sister.<br /><br />She asked me to order it late and I told her that most likely it would not be received in time for christmas<br /><br />No problem it arrived at least a week before christmas, and about two weeks before expected. Also must say it was in excellent condition and my brother in law was over the moon.<br /><br />Thank you
B00008GKEG|5.0|I enjoyed this. It is good seeing history from the Beatles point of view themselves. I am going to watch it all again soon.
1907563202|5.0|This item was delivered on time and just as it stated it would be. Very good book very informative. Would recommend to a friend.
B000000XB8|5.0|Great LP. Fantasy vinyl. Three dimensional warm analog sound. It is so much better than anything I have ever heard via any digital media, and I have tried it all: CD's, DVD-A, SACD, Etc. An occassional pop between songs is well worth the price of the sound I get with analog. If you can't tell the difference, then stick to MP3's! It is also flat, which is very importatnt to sound and an issue with many LP manufacturers.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This item was delivered on time and just as it stated it would be. Very good book very informative. Would recommend to a friend.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|The camera runs upside down the Facebook won't connect. It's worthless. I can run the extra camera I have on here buys its a hassle
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn has a fantastic way of keeping me hooked and surprising me several times in each novel, a true master of his genre... this is one of his best!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really like it. It's fun! But one thing I do not really like it's energy thing because it runs out so fast &amp; yes I know I can get more but I don't want to spend my dollars because then I know I will need them for something else &amp; I know I can buy some with real money &amp; that I will not do. Sorry!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's a great read you just want to keep reading just to find out the saga I want to know if they will have some kids
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I find this app very useful. When I'm on the go I can sync my droid razor max with my kindle fire HD via hot spot and launch the app to access files and applications on my computer at home. A bit buggy but still a decent app.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|I was so glad to find this cd pack online. I went to every media store looking for it. I enjoy the bonus cd  & I LOVE HER!!!
B0034G4P94|5.0|Very satisfied with shipping, description of item and price of item. Made my Christmas shopping easier. Very satisfied customer.Thanks alot
B006O6F932|1.0|I bought this for my neice for Christmas. Paid $80 for it. Not only are the instructions pitiful the peices do not snap together. She is unable to play with it. It falls apart! Do Not waste your money on this product. We will return it ASAP!
B005EHILV4|5.0|I was looking for a long time. I was surprised with the size of the team, because it is small and very useful
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|it a great game love it cant get even put it down . love games like this have to try some more
B008M721MS|5.0|Setup on the Fire HD was a snap.  I created a new account in under two minutes with no issues, other than not putting in my country code into my phone number. I searched for a contact, and the search results came back very quickly.<br /><br />Call quality was great - it was just as good as on a one-year old laptop.  I experienced smooth video and audio.  Highly recommended.
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing!  Exhilarating! Intense! Erotic!  Mind boggling!!  This tops 50 shades-  Where can I get a Gideon Cross for my birthday Friday???
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Even if you are not a Taylor Swift fan you will find something on this CD to love.<br />An enjoyable CD.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It is helpful to my language. I really . Like this book it will be useful for a lot of things.
0374530718|4.0|The book is exactly as it is shown.  I ended up not needing the book for my class, so I had not read it yet, but from what I hear from others and what I have read about it, the book seems interesting.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Awesome and interesting book<br />I personally loved it. That the only way it would get would be to make it a movie
B000YHG72E|5.0|I'm not fond of Will Ferrell, as a general rule.  Elf is the exception to the rule!!  Very cute!!  The kids even loved it!!!  I recommend seeing.  :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will broaden the smallest minds and light the darkest hearts. No matter where you are in your life, this is a place and feeling and emotion and moment we have all found ourselves in
1435122968|4.0|Since I purchased this as a gift for grandson, I'm not sure my rating will help much.  I was impressed with the book, itself, when I opened the packaging.  Our grandson thought it was 'awesome' when he opened it on Christmas Day.  It will certainly make a nice addition to his library.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I just heard about this author and decided to start reading his works by beginning with his 1st book. He is a thrilling,chilling writer who packs his story with action, excitement and tension. The only complaint I have is his story goes on for a long, long time. However, that is like getting too much icecream. Something most of us can live with. I will definately be reading the rest of his books...........once I catch my breath from this one.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I'm loving this simple controlled game. its easy. once you hey to 6 miles its very hard but very much worth the effort. I think many will love this game<br />try ot you will see
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the angry birds.  This is my first exposure to it and it is somply &#34;chewing gum&#34; for both the mind and the eyes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I hated almost all the characters in this book to some degree, but that's what I ended up liking about the book. What's kind of funny is that the characters were like no one else I've ever known, and usually I spend a book trying to figure out who characters remind me of.<br />My only complaint, and this is not the author's fault, is that the price of the book is far too high. I bought it for my Kindle, but it took me several weeks to talk myself into it. A book review is not the place to go into a rant about the publishing industry's abuse of ebook prices, but it bugged me enough to actually hinder my opinion. Weird, huh?<br />Anyway, I'm worried that giving any details at all about this book will ruin it for future readers, so you'll just have to trust me that it's fabulous and it's nothing at all like what you think it's going to be.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a simple calculator for occasional at home use.  What more can I say about it?  It works as advertised....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds is like an addiction, once you start you can't stop. I love Star Wars, so when I saw Angry Birds came out with a Star Wars version I had to buy it right away.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is the kind of game that I love playing when I'm tired of thinking too hard. It will probably get harder the longer I play but so far so great.
B000I9U8VO|5.0|Loved watching X-Men movies ever since I saw them when they first came out. I own all of them except the 2nd one, so I rented it off of Amazon, which was cheap and convenient.
1616960922|4.0|The Emperor's Soul is a fast read at only 170 pages.  It is more novella length than book length but it still tells a complete story.<br /><br />I loved Shai.  She believes in what she does and considers herself an artist.  When she is given the change to give the Emperor a new soul in return for her life she throws herself into the challenge.  She knows that if she succeeds the people who promised her freedom will kill her instead. It was the challenge that drew her.  No one had ever done this before.  She started a job and she was determined to see it through to the finish.  That did not mean she did not put in some very subtle changes in the Emperor's personality.<br /><br />The story needed one loyal man and that was Gaotona.  He really carried for the emperor.  Working with Shai he began to understand the extent of the job she was trying to do.  He had a more open mind that any of the other characters.  He still did not like what was being done but developed an unexpected respect for Shai.<br /><br />Wondering how everything was going to turn out generated a great deal of tension.  The ending held a few surprises.<br /><br />If you like Brandon Sanderson's writing be sure to pick up The Emperor's Soul.  It is a very entertaining read.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this for my brother and I for Christmas. I had it on my phone for 3 days before it cracked and broke. It fell off my couch onto my fake hardwood floors and cracked the case right down the side. It did however protect my phone from shattering. Also when tested if waterproof...it wasn't. Don't waste your money
1594135851|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book as well as the series. It came in record time. Highly recommend buy used and give it away after you read it, so others get the benefit.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Good movie had alot of action. I like the old guys coming out to do this film, good job very good.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This movie classic is always enjoyable! It is a wonderful story that was way ahead of its time. Fun for all!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Love Robert Downey Jr. ! Love Sherlock Holmes, the two together movie magic.<br /><br />The music is wonderful, and Actors amazing!!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Very entertaining and it certainly covers the globe and a lot of history! The main character is great with no political alliances!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks, but this book had me on the edge and not wanting to put it down!  Definitely would recommend it!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What a great suspenseful novel, I don't want to give away too many details in this Cain and Abel of a book. Let's just say the game's afoot.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|This book is great for kids. The reason why its so good is cause its about a middle school kid trying to survive. But his brothers manny, and rodrick are no help.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I looked at other cases and purchased this one.  I like it but wish I got the one with the elastic band to hold my hand.<br />My granddaughter like the purple color.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just wanted a game for my Kindle. It is easy to learn and it can be played any where and at any time.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Granddaughter really like the Legos and now all I have to do is purchase more for her.<br />Way to go Lego.

1455846783|2.0|This is a review only of the audiobook.<br /><br />I'm having extraordinary trouble listening to any of the sections narrated by Alison Hiroto, who for some reason was directed (?) to over-enunciate every consonant \\"T\\" and speak mostly in monotone, so that she ends up sounding eerily inhuman.  Generally, I like to listen to audiobooks for my commute at the same time I'm reading the text at home. In this case, however, the audiobook is doing harm to my enjoyment of the story. While I am still early on in the audiobook, and I realize the Aomame character might intentionally be sounding like an android, I'm not entirely sure this is intentional. \\"Heart attack\\" is pronounced \\"HearT Tat-Tack.\\"  English speakers just don't talk this way.... it's maddening.<br /><br />Skip the audiobook if you can.

B006O6EOII|4.0|My daughter's first Monster High doll and this is her favorite character.  I haven't looked if it is normal, but it seems like the pieces can break off or pull apart easily.  Not sure if this is normal.  So if your child is younger, there are small parts that would cause a choking hazard.  Keep it to the older girls.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The current version (1.x version) is an old version of the Facebook Android app.  Facebook released a new version in December that is completely rewritten and supposedly much faster, but it's not available in the App Store on Amazon.  It appears that Facebook has been addressing their Android app and now Amazon has the ball on getting us a version that works.<br /><br />Edit 12/27/12:<br />Changed from 1 to 3 stars<br /><br />Now the 2.0 version seems to be approved is working on our Fire HD 8.9.  Interestingly, they also approved it for the original Fire, and while it's MUCH better than the web shortcut for browsing your feed, I'm having some trouble posting comments on our original Fire.  Hopefully now Facebook's bug fixes will get approved quickly and will address the problems seen on the original Fire and I can up my rating.
0307394549|2.0|Very nicelly made book. The pictures of each recepy help anticipating what should be the final result. Many great choices of cookies to chose from. I had a lot of fun spending time with my children choosing the next &#34;experiment&#34;. However, I'm VERY disapointed that every single recepy I try is significantly off by some ingredient and I have to repeat some times to adjust it. It is normal for recepies to require adjustments, sure, but this book seems to be full of typos in the number of cup's, spoons, measures of some kind.<br />As a biochemist I follow the recepy (protocol) to the extreme, and in this book, this is just a recepy for cookie disaster.

B007BVMVDU|5.0|Multiple gripping plot lines.  Characters which develop and bring you in.  Gratuitous sex/violence much like Rome which viewers will either love or find over the top or even distasteful (as one friend put it when I asked if it was any good, &#34;Oh yeah, Game of Thrones?  It's great.  It's basically soft core porn&#34;).  Having said that, the plot lines, scenery and the characters make the series and engage the viewer.
B000HX499S|4.0|This is one of my favorites, whenever I get the &#34;mean reds&#34; I throw this one on.  Its beautiful and lovely to watch on a big screen.  Blake Edwards is an amazing director, and although the story differs from the book, the general sentiment stays in tact.

B000002MNR|5.0|Not Knopfler's normal stuff.  Very good though.  I didnt realize what a great musician he is until this CD.  Excellent.
B000HEWEJO|3.0|I just watched It's A Wonderful Life again the other night and it was comforting to find that time and life can mold one's opinion. I've always liked this movie but it was generally enjoyed in the sentimental run-up to Christmas and tossed in with the rest of the holiday fare. Therefore, it was always judged as a simple feel-good holiday movie and nothing more. After last night's viewing, I found myself with a lot more questions than answers and a lot more criticism than optimism.<br /><br />For starters, given today's political landscape, I find such a movie a bit confusing. Why isn't Potter hailed as a job creator and Bailey Loan a victim of the invisible hand of the free market? Isn't George's method of running his bank closer to socialism than pure capitalism? Most troubling, what is the message? Is it that staying in a stifling dead-end small town and a soul-crushing job are offset by the presence of friends and family? Is it saying that one has to choose between the two?<br /><br />It isn't hard to empathize with George's simmering rage because he is beaten down so much by the misery of Bedford Falls that he ends up a whipped dog who settles on suicide rather than facing another day of his life. What brings him back is an angel who reminds him that two people would've had dramatically different life outcomes if he hadn't been born. Both key events occurred when he was young, so surely he could've left town and let Bedford Falls take care of itself while he pursued his dreams. Why is that the only choice - non-existence or never leaving Bedford Falls? Could he not have been the one to save the soldiers?  Could he not have returned after his travels to rescue Mary from the library and raise his brood? It's all so frustratingly fatalistic.<br /><br />In the end, I think this movie is mismatched as a Christmas movie. The only part that takes place around the holiday is the final scenes and the larger point isn't contingent upon the holidays. IAWL is a sweet but ultimately muddled message of a movie and it is a far cry from the other Christmas Capra, the powerful and life-affirming Meet John Doe.  Merry Christmas, Potterville. 3.5 stars.timately muddled message of a movie and it is a far cry from the other Christmas Capra, the powerful and life-affirming Meet John Doe.

B009ERK35W|4.0|This review applies to the Blu-ray Miramax release from 2012. If you're a fan of this film and want to upgrade to the hi-def picture, you'll be pleased to know that the transfer is superb, adding a level of clarity that adds immensely to the experience. But be warned:  the extras consist only of three interviews (with the two principal actors, and the production director). If you own the original Canadian DVD release, don't part with it, since it contains the director commentary and a 'making of', neither of which are included in this Blu-ray treatment.<br /><br />That commentary was an invaluable aid, and explains certain directorial decisions that impact the pace and style of acting. For one thing, Cronenberg was inspired by Salman Rushdie, who, as you may recall, was the exiled Persian author marked for assassination by Islamic fundamentalists in the late 90s. Cronenberg took this concept and applied it to a game designer (played here by Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is trapped in her own creation, and winds up in a game of EXistenZ (\\"capital X and capital Z\\", explains the marketing rep), fighting for her life. Another aspect of the production involves the cues taken from early video games, in which characters appear to be catatonic until the others utter a phrase that prompts the required response. For viewers who missed this type of gaming experience, this may come across as bad acting, or a Cronenberg conceit. Of course, it's neither. There are other touches: generic locations labelled COUNTRY GAS STATION, HOTEL, and CHINESE RESTAURANT, which reflect the conventions of early gaming.<br /><br />Cronenberg was known earlier in his career for emphasizing fleshy horror - exploding heads, dissection, and body metamorphosis. This will surprise viewers who have come to him only recently, in his more mainstream thrillers, 'A History of Violence' and 'Eastern Promises'. With Existenz, we're somewhere in between: Existenz is played by a group who are all connected by a type of fleshy umbilicus. You have to have a bioport installed in your lower spine, and need to purchase a controller that looks more like a mound of flesh than a joystick or mouse. The film is rife with imagery involving 'jacking in' with the ports, and sly body humor. On the other hand, the setting is pure thriller, in its own way.<br /><br />I follow Cronenberg closely and rank this film in the top 50% of his output, on a par with 'Videodrome', but not quite as satisfying as 'Dead Ringers', and 'Spider', both of which bring in a new level of human tragedy not found in all of Cronenberg's work. (in the former, there's also the magnificent Jeremy Irons in an Oscar-worthy performance).  As far as I know, Existenz is the first Blu-Ray revamping of his earlier films. As other Cronenberg films are upgraded, I'd like to see more of the excellent remastering we have here, without sacrificing the commentary and other features that were so valuable to the overall package.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game to pass time with. also good for problem solving to keep ones brain sharp. i  was pleasantly surprised at how addicting this game is  highly recommend this game.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My children, ages 10, 8, and 5, all like this game.  We have it on the Kindle Fire and they also bought it for their iPods with their own money.  It is easy to understand and fun to play.  There are tons of things to do in the game and you can build your own Kingdom to your liking.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|If you have a kindle fire this app isn't good for you.  The app would not let me exit. I would have to turn off my kindle and then exit. It got really annoying.

Also I couldn't let my little sister play this without me watching her because this app allows you to spend real money on coins. Please don't get this I do not recommend this for anyone.

B009VB97EY|3.0|I am a huge channing fan so I wanted to route for this movie but I wasnt as good as I had hope for. Whoever made this movie didnt seem to be able to decide wether they wanted to do a strip movie or a I'm going places story. They left alot of ideas unfinished and made these sideline stories seem pointless and further more if they werent going to tie up those lose ends of the stories they should have not wasted film time with them and made more dance scenes instead. In review to many unfinished side stories and not enough dancing
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|It works great for such an inexpensive option. One caution to users is to make sure the on switch doesn't accidentally switch to off. We were filming and we pushed the plug between the couch cushions and it pushed the switch to off. We didn't have sound for most of our filming before we noticed. Whoops! Still love it though.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Plays nice and smooth with accurate angles and attractive, contrasting colors.  Occassonally passes through balls instead of striking them.  A good purchase but the patterns quickly make scoring impossible so it becomes a less of a challenge and more of playing from zero over and over.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I seen this movie about a year and half ago and it really intrigued me. I ended up purchasing the movie because there is so much information in it and if you really care what you put into your body and where it comes from, this movie is really an eye opener and makes you rethink what is &#34;healthy&#34; for you. I can honestly say that watching this movie changed my views on certain fast food chains and store bought foods forever.

0307744434|1.0|There are 1300+ reviews as I write this, so I sincerely doubt I have anything to add to this discussion.  Why bother then?  I suppose it's because I haven't rolled my eyes so many times since reading Jodi Piccoult, and I want to officially register my disappointment.<br /><br />So why did I roll my eyes?  Mostly the writing.  And lack of plot.  So many badly written words for so little to happen.  The characters were like paper dolls on popsicle sticks being moved around by a clumsy puppeteer.

B00AMBM9MO|1.0|How do you make a teddy bear grotesque?  By having Seth Macfarlane power him, that's how.  This poorly acted, contrived movie is just plain awful.  The humor is what you would expect of the family guy, not a feature length film.  Bad jokes about getting high and doing stupid things over and over and over while sexualizing a stuffed bear just makes this dreadful to watch.  My wife and I couldn't make it past the half hour mark so buyer beware!

0525478817|5.0|... in absolutely the best way. I read this book in under half a day because I literally couldn't put it down. I bought it around sunset and read in the car until I really couldn't make out the words in front of me anymore. I picked at my dinner, absently pet my cat, I basically sat on the floor and ignored everything around me and stayed up in the wee hours of the morning to finish.<br />And I cried for exactly 99 pages, and it was horrible and made me feel all kinds of things, but I loved every word. John Green is at the top of my favourite authors list, and this book is what propelled him up there. Hazel and Augustus are amazing characters that I loved throughout the entire story. And I know I'll read this book a hundred more times, I've already read it twice.<br />I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, and if my mom weren't so stubborn, I would have thrust this on her months ago and made her love it too.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read most of John Grisham's books.  This one seemed a bit slow at times compared to many of his other books but it was still enjoyable.  The main character was not really a likable guy in my opinion.

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|That Seth McFarlane has not one, but multiple series running on TV is surprising. That he was able to get this movie produced and distributed is deplorable.<br />If you find beyond-excessive profanity, bongs and Boston accents funny, you might find this movie mildly amusing. However, I could recommend a number of other films with the same elements which manage to have more than a shallow and annoyingly repetitive shell of a plot. Your time could be equally well spent riding a city bus around with a bunch of juvenile boys. The writing is not intelligent and even the fart jokes are pathetic.<br />It's a shame so many notables made cameo appearances in this film, as they all came off looking like sleazy idiots (yes, even Norah Jones).<br />Ted goes well beyond raunchy humour and is just simply a complete waste of time.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Looks good and has nice weight to it. The clear case backing that allows you to see the movement is nice.  The only issue I have is that the face is rather small.  I did not expect it to be so small.

B008KE3960|5.0|its an incredibly fun game but if you get to many planes they will bump into each other and its harder to win
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|I am one to enjoy a good film despite violence.  However this film was too vulgar and disturbing for me.  If you do not like harsh and disturbing images then I would pass as the acting and story were not great either.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|this game is difficult but it really gets you thinking , although as i said it is pretty difficult  don't buy this if you hate challenges
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a timeless classic that you can enjoy each year. Even though you know whats coming next it is still funny.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|its kinda easy but its also kinda hard at some point . plus its just to simple then it becomes way to hard
0812550706|5.0|I had previously read this book and wanted to have a new copy. Both the quality of the book and delivery was perfect as Amazong has proven is always consistent with!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I am Taylor Swift's biggest fan and this is the best album yet! So take a look at this album ( i love Stay Stay Stay!)
B0089K7DGW|5.0|Blu- ray has performed as expected. Extra content and ability to view enhanced materials is a plus and greatly enjoyed.
0307454568|5.0|Made my husband smile on christmas it was one of the items he asked for. It arrived quickly after the order was placed
B000QCS8TW|5.0|After watching a few episodes of Game of Thrones I found the show compelling.  Before I could continue viewing the series I had to read the books.  This was an action packed story with great character plots that were easy to follow.  I'd recommend reading this series to anyone from teens to adults.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This wont be the \\"complete\\" saga for long. I hear Disney is making another trilogy starting with VII.<br />If that happens, this product will be a literal lie. But, a true lie, nonetheless.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|WOW! What a great book! I would expect a good book from Nicholas Sparks..he is the BEST and never disappoints me. The pace is fast moving, a 'can't put it down' type book. Characters are so believable, and it is full of unexpected surprises and twists. This is not one of those stories that you have all figured out by page twelve! And just WAIT for the fabulous ending. So surprising and emotional.  You have done it again, Nicholas..it is on the top of my recommendation list.<br />Movie is to be released Feb. 14, 2013. I, for one, will NOT miss seeing it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well written. Enjoyed the story which kept me going up to the end. Unsatisfying ending unless the only intent is to lay the groundwork for a follow-up. If that's the case, it is possible to do that without leaving the reader feeling as if their investment of time was wasted. Or maybe the intent was to show how perfect the characters are for each other in their own demented way. I don't know I just felt a bit cheated. I would read another book by the author however. She does understand the craft as well as how to engage the reader.
B004KKX80A|2.0|This toy broke within 8 hours of being used.  Also all the instructions were in another language.  At least put the instructions in English or let the one purchasing the product know this in advance.  Now I cannot even find another part for this toy .  NOt a happy customer!!
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Full of action worth the money.  If you are into action moves this one is for you it is not for the young ones.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was stupid and the worst language. I would not recommend this movie to anyone!
B002HR1W1K|5.0|if you haven't seen it....watch it. Its not a good one for the kids though, its a little too intense.
B0088TG252|4.0|This was a really good movie. It had a good story with a twist. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This has to be one of the best comedies ever. All the actors are funny with great personalities. Laughter is the best medicine against germs/infections/diseases - this is the cure all!!!
B007T99ENE|4.0|relaxing yet smart read, good for holidays, clever twists & turns, keeps you turning the pages, nostalgic of Britain in the 60s and 70s
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Jo Nesbo is a wonderful writer  and Harry Hole a loveable character, warts and all.  The book is a page turner and I don't want to give away any more than that.
B007T9FRFS|5.0|Kathy Reichs is a very good author in my opinion she has the knowledge as well she is a great story teller, she comes up with some very good situations in her stories.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I balked on renting this film...even @ $1.99....but was pleasantly surprised when I did rent it! Great storyline, 1969 clothes, music, cars. and I Like those motorcycles and Cell phones too!<br />A Fun time! ENJOY IT SOON!
B0035FQ1UU|5.0|Everyone should have this movie in their library!  Never get tired of watching it.  Gave as Christmas presents !  Great flick.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great bible app you can set up all kinds of devotionals to read everyday. I would definetly recommend this app.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I love the original, and I know this is something new and different, so I am looking forward to seeing the movie so I have better context to but the music to in my mind... I have enjoyed it, its just that I have seen the original 3 times on stage and listened the the Original London Recording probably over a 100 times... Enjoy and keep an open mind and ear... D
B00004CYVZ|5.0|I love this movie.  I haven't played the DVD but it looks fine.  I couldn't find it in any store close to me.
B007UQRW62|3.0|I bought the 60th Anniversary Blue-Ray box set as a gift for a SITR fan, and everything was perfect except the umbrella, which was defective. The umbrella had a large rip and looked used even though the rest of the box set was brand new (unopened, still in the original plastic packaging). Although the umbrella is not really meant for actual use (it looks more like a collector's item and probably wouldn't stand a chance against the wind), it was still disappointing since the tear was extremely noticeable.<br /><br />The set includes a blue-ray disc of SITR, 2 DVDs of extras, a nice little book with photos and info about the actors in the movie, and an envelope with three little mini-panel strips that combine to make a miniature theatrical poster.<br /><br />The box set would have been perfect if the umbrella weren't damaged. :/<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007UQRW62 Singin' In The Rain: 60th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I write blogs and ebooks for a living so this app makes it easy for me to write my ideas, outlines, ebooks, and save them on PDF files all while saving them and emailing them without having to use backspace memory. Best part is you dont need wifi or internet connection to fully enjoy the benefits of this app, except when you email. Also its very user friendly.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Call it what you want I think it's a beautiful love story. I wish there was another book. I've read these 3 three times.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|but parts are interesting in the sense that you know the main character is going to pull something of a con on the system, just plays it out a little at a time.<br />the ending was abrupt and unimaginative...just my two cents worth.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is my favorite of the Batman trilogy of movies. Very timely when the class warfare of Bane matches that of President Obama and the Democrats.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a touching, heartfelt, and honest story. Very sweet and simply adorable at points. Characters were believable and honest. I read this in one day!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Josh Brolin does a fantastic job as a younger agent K from the 1960s.  Very funny with a very touching scene towards the end.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|You can only see a few statuses, after that they're in blue, can't see the pictures and tapping the status won't open it either. What stupid idiot thought that was a good idea? Seriously, my tablet should be able to do more than my phone.
B00005QG9I|5.0|I grew up listening to this band, and out of all their albums I think this one is probably my favorite.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book deserves my full five stars. Nicholas Sparks did an extraordinary job in the creation of this novel. It kept you wanting more throughout the whole book, needing to know what the secret was. I cried tears of joy and sadness for Land on and learned so much about myself in this novel. Excellent work from Sparks, I'd read this book ten more times and still love every inch.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As much as I will always love Pride & Prejudice, I love North & South even more because the characters actually either work for a living or experience how hard life is. There is an instant chemistry between them that is so electric that you wonder how these two people are able to restrain themselves from ravishing each other. Hahaha! Ok I'll stop now. :)
B005DOKIYG|1.0|it is the wrong size and is going back to you<br />perhaps you should have noticed that we ordered a kindle fire hd, and been notified that is was wrong
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is addictive!  Easy to play on my Kindle Fire. It is challenging as you progress up the levels.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the best war movie I have seen.  The realism is fantastic.  This is bound to be a classic film.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Sure, it is a distant fourth behind The Muppet Movie, The Muppets Take Manhattan, and The Great Muppet Caper, but it is WAY ahead of EVERY OTHER Muppet movie since!
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Fabulous story for reading aloud during the holiday season.  Our family also enjoys the beautiful illustrations.  This book is great for all ages and can be a fun addition to Christmas traditions.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|always loved this movie, had to add it to my massive movie collection...great, gory and fun for the whole family
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book ( dictionary) can teach you LOTS of new words ! It can improve  your vocabulary and grammar . You can learn more than English words. This book includes latin words , spanish words even england words. This is a good source of education and learning. I encourage people to read this book . I would like to thank the authors and contributors who put together this masterpiece. You are very much appreciated .
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was a nice movie to watch not slap stick just funny . A family movie that everyone can enjoy together .
B000FA5SMK|4.0|As always Nelson does a great job with plot, character development, and suspense.  Loved this one in the series.  Would have given it 5 stars except for all the typos in the kindle version.  Too bad...
B008P9M614|5.0|MY SON IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR AND LIKES THIS SERIES VERY MUCH.  WATCHES RERUNS, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TWO YEARS.  THIS SET WAS A GIFT.
B005LAII8A|5.0|LOOPER is one of the most intriguing and entertaining science-fiction movies that I've seen in some time.  My wife describes it as \\"THE TERMINATOR Meets THE OMEN,\\" but that simple depiction really doesn't do justice to this multi-layered, well thought out action thriller, written and directed by Rian Johnson.<br /><br />The story is set in the not too distant future when time travel has been invented, but is forbidden and is only available on the black market.  When the Mob wants to get rid of somebody, they send their victim thirty years into the past where a hit man (or \\"looper\\") is waiting to kill him.<br /><br />Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper, getting rich off his kills and looking forward to retiring in France.  Then, one day, the Mob decides to \\"close the loop,\\" sending back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) for assassination.  The older Joe, however, has other plans.<br /><br />Johnson's film is totally original in its concept; filled with colorful characters and many unexpected story twists.  I don't want to be a Spoiler, thus I am not going to reveal further plot details.  Bottom line: If you enjoy films that deal with time travel, or just good storytelling then I cannot recommend LOOPER too highly.<br /><br />Willis and Gordon-Levitt are excellent, as are the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, Piper Perabo and Jeff Daniels.<br /><br />The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains many extras: Feature commentary by Johnson, Gordon-Levitt and Blunt, two \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes, deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I liked the insight it gave into Pat 's life and journey to his closure.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|A great collection with my only gripe being that there are some songs missing from this collection.  However, I understand that some songs had to be cut.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a fun, even in predictable, movie.  Loved the idea of different body types being dancers.  Makes you want to dance!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Its a good album.  Definitely a move from country to pop but that is not necessarily a bad thing. My only complaint is probably that it sounds a little too polished
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I should have read all of the reviews before purchasing this app. The picture quality is very poor. The pictures are blurry and very grainy. After reading reviews I found outthat this app is not even needed. Waste of $1.99. Do not purchase!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|since newest upload/update cant see mkre than 5-10 most recent posts depending on size of posts and responses.<br />i'd like the old app back please.<br />if you have old app dontupdate.<br />if you have newest 9&quot; fire, you are screwed because you have noalternative butnew app
B0076DELIG|4.0|A good read.  Nopt all of the pieces add up as neatly as in other Bosch books but this was a decent read.  The end is a bit implausible.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I saw this movie in theaters, thought it was just okay. Then I read the book and liked it a lot so I thought maybe I would like the movie more if I saw it again. I was wrong. I don't know why but I just didn't dig this movie. Hope the sequels are better.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|One of the best bands ever.  Every song here is a classic. Turn it up and enjoy the best that CCR has to offer
B00479SVBU|1.0|I have my entire music collection on my Zune and/or iPod classic.  I bought this item thinking that I would be able to use it to listen to my music in my car.  It is a complete worthless peice of junk!!  It would not work with any of my portable devices, and has now been thrown in my junk drawer.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|it's a good game. I play it on my moms phone all the time. All my friends love it a lot.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Normall I don't buy illustrated novels on Kindle because, unless you have a Fire, Kindle and Pictures just don't go together.  However, this book was free so I figured, how bad could it be?  This worked out great, I got to read a novel I really enjoy, and my daughter got 10 or 12 photos to look at, enhancing her enjoyment of this book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was soooo good wish it didn't have to end it should be your first choice when I was reading I got lost in all the words
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my nephew and he loves it.  I can't speak for its quality or entertainment myself, but I was told by everyone who saw it that it was a very cool lego set and he really enjoyed building it and playing with it.  It comes with some really detailed mini figures too.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter.  She had read the books first.  She said the DVDs were nothing like the books, but she loved them nonetheless!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Dixit is a really fun game that is difficult to explain without playing it.  Its very artsy and forces the players to, not only interpret the art on their cards, BUT to guess how the other players will or will not interpret it based on your clues.  Each game of Dixit will change depending on your cards, your frame of mind, and the players you play with.  This is my first game of Dixit, so I can't compare it to the other versions, but I really enjoyed this and will probably buy expansion cards in the future.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Bought this to listen to whilst decorating the tree this year.  PERFECT!  You won't be disappointed.  Well worth the $ - destined to be a classic!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Fascinating story and unbelievable look at conditions in North Korean prison camps. This is a story that needs to be told.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|From the get go, disc 1 ep. 1...BAD... grainy, fuzzy blacks and horrid closeups..akin to past dvd release quality..like a bad vhs copy.Like they took the older film transferred to video masters for orig. tv broadcasts and first season sets produced on standard dvd.  Like they blinked, got lazy and all of a sudden, portions of scenes are NOT HD quality! Not all episodes are though.  A different farmed out restoration house worked on this season, NOT CBS!  And it defiantly shows!  I am now watching disc 3, ep. 1.  Some shots are fine.  Some are extremely poor. Most shots of crew faces and their uniforms are just pathetic.  Not sure if it's the pressings, the different film stock grain TNG used, or both..but it's DRAMATICALLY lesser quality than season 1 hands down! It's \\"inconceivable\\" CBS viewed and ok'd these re-masterings and gave their blessings and sent them to factory to be produced!  THANK GOODNESS, CBS is doing season 3 again!  But I cringe @ the thought of the season closer/cliff hanger: \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\" being awesome, and then part II for season 4 being butchered w/ a 2nd rate restorations house again,..for every other season!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Apparently this is a major issue that is not being fixed!  Terrible! This needs to be addressed and fixed!  A big thumbs down!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|ilove how they incoperated the shooting animals for food if only it contained mini gmmes however if it does i will be very ecstatic as i have notgotten far enoughiin the game to adquetly judge however wayy cool ya!
0525953728|4.0|This book offers an insightful look into a day in the life of special operations. Not quite as gripping a read as I was expecting.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I'm not real clear as to whether we're to rate the general item or the condition it arrives in.  If you want to know the condition - the sliding cover came chewed up and the plastic case was cracked all over.  Otherwise, it was a fantastic movie.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Robert Downey, Jr. is very talented in this show--very diverse actor.  Some of his disguises crack me up. Him and Jude Law work well together in this show.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I was caught up into the story immediately and enjoyed both the airey-fairy parts and the battle scenes .Charlize Theron was enthralling. Great ride.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|We got both Sherlock Holmes movies--every Christmas break, we have a movie marathon of all the new shows we got for Christmas.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Five stars for a monster movie?  Why not.  I'm not saying this movie is like &#34;Ghandi&#34; or &#34;Black Swan&#34; or anything, but as a sci-fi flick it is excellent - the performances are very good, but it is mainly the special effects that get you.  Very realistic, and very effective.  And you gotta watch the last couple of minutes - what falls into the water?  much debating about what that means.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Captain America is wonderful--great story--love how they intertwine the story endings together with all the different Avengers, so you can watch the Avengers and know everyone's full story.  You will love it!  Make sure to watch after the credits for the part that goes with the Avengers movie.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|It is good to see Natalie Portman grow beyond her earlier characters and try something that brings out an entirely different range of feelings.  An amazing psychological thriller, an amazing performance by the entire cast - and, hey, casting Barbara Hershey as Natalie's mother was a stroke of absolute brilliance (there is even a facial resemblance that makes it very plausible that they are mother and daughter).  The dancing sequences are brilliant and captivating.  It certainly deserved all the plaudits it received.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|Good story and the actors do a great job--a must see.  Lots of adventure! Some violence, but no bad language, which is a plus, these days.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|This movie has two of my favorite actors - Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.  And they are definitely worth watching in this movie - very compelling performances.  As the movie progresses, and you begin to realize what's going to happen, you feel the sadness and frustration that would be expected in this sort of relationship.  Pitt is great as the man who is born old and dies as a baby, while Blanchett is excellent as the love interest in his life.  The special effects and CGI are amazing.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|It is not often that you find an album this great!  I love every song.  I look forward to hearing more form Imagine Dragons in the future.
B005S9EJ46|4.0|This is a fairly predictable movie with a very nice cast.  Sort of just the kind of movie you'd expect a bunch of old fogies to be in (nothing derogatory intended - I'm an old fogie, too).
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I have only recently discovered this author and this is the third of her books that I have now read.  Neither of the first two disappointed and certainly this one was no different. Kate Morton has a great command of bringing her characters to life, describing them and their surroundings well.  Her characters are complex but well defined.  She weaves her plot over different times zones, going backwards and forwards in those time zones, with great skill.  She manages this so cleverly, thereby holding your interest, pulling it all together chapter by chapter, and very succinctly, right through to the story climax. I will certainly be looking out for more of her work.
B003498SDA|4.0|This was a nice turn for Cruise - he actually comes off well as the baddy.  Jamie Foxx is also fairly good as the good guy, although his performance is a little uneven - but this may be due to the role he is asked to play, which comes close to being implausible.  The &#34;final victim&#34; is almost totally predictable.  The exchanges between Cruise and Foxx are some of the best scenes.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Besides the item was received very quickly the charger does in fact charge faster than any car charger I have used in the past. I wish they would make a charger for house use  as I would definately buy one. EXCELLENT CHARGER
B001GCUO5W|5.0|A psychological thriller that puts DiCaprio through his paces, and he makes it with shining colors.  A movie to be watched more than once, as each viewing reveals more and more content to a very complex character.
0307704610|3.0|The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman [Abridged, Audiobook] [Audio CD]<br /><br />Even though the CD have a lot of talking points, it did not have the detailed guidelines and direction to help a reader with the day to day weight loss information. I believe that Weight Watchers has more helpful information to help one lose weight and gain muscle. Rick
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This app is awesome. Makes me want to be a better person. I love it to death. Absolute swag. Heck yeah
1442355476|2.0|I guess I need to read more carefully when pre-ordering before books are released.  I opened my Christmas present and was ready to start listening this morning when I found only 5 CDs.  That didn't seem like enough for a Vince Flynn book since I've listened to every one of them except Term Limits (couldn't find that on CD so enjoyed the actual book).  I looked all over the packaging but couldn't find any text that said &#34;abridged.&#34;  So I went to the Library website and saw the full book is 10 CDs.  I'm now on the waiting list for the library copy since I want to enjoy every word Mr. Flynn wrote, not a scaled back version.  Amazon, please stop selling abridged versions or at least give us a big warning so we don't make the same mistake again.
B0001CCXZW|2.0|The last disc on this thing was broken. I tried to play it in multiple ways and it did not work. I don't want to waste the time returning just the one disc it was only 4 bucks anyway.
B0055SWM08|4.0|An imaginative and challenging puzzle game. Well thought out and fun for anyone who likes puzzles. I highly recommend it.
B001W57EYM|5.0|I could go on a rant about how well written this book is and how great the characters are brought out, but I've done it numerous times before to people and for projects.  I bought this copy because my own was ruined by wear and tear, plus I did not have the first edition cover as this one does.  Great read for a great price, I highly recommend this book and its sequels.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It gave me hope.  Made me believe there's always people out there that will be there for you. Just beautiful. Infinite.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Very entertaining, tons of stuff to do and explore. Also the graphics are cool, the people who made this really convey depth.
0062202081|5.0|My daughter loves it!!!! And she is very hard to please which in return makes me very happy!!!! Thank you
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Not very interesting, whole movie is the inside of a therapy session. All the 'previews' is the very end of the movie. Disappointed and not worth the money.
0316056863|2.0|The book arrived in excellent condition and promptly.  My reading group was very disappointed in the content.  Not much to laugh about.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Winter of the World - Very informative and a good read. A super holiday read. Enjoying it thoroughly. Should reda the fall of giants first though.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|It is difficult for me to express how much I am over books written for young adults that glorify abusive relationships - whether physical or emotional abuse is abuse.  Yet another book of this flavor.  Dear authors - please stop encouraging young women to seek out and carry out these awful relationships with never a hint from you of all the ways it's utterly damaging.  Enough.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Action packed!! Enjoyed every minute from start to finish. One of those movies I can watch over and over again..
B00APUQRPC|4.0|It was an enjoyable movie.  I am a sucker for a sports movie, but it was more than that.  I think anyone could enjoy this movie -- men AND women.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I loved this film and have watched it multiple times.  In order to enjoy it I simply pretend I never read a Batman comic.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book for comedy and laughter . I have read lots of books for this series . That are all good .  Thank you
B007RTAR64|5.0|I Just Got This Doll For Christmas And Am Very Very Very Happy With It! Katniss Looks Just Like From The Movie! I Can See How Much Detail The Designers At Mattel Put Into It! They Even Included The Mocking Jay Pin! When I Took Her Out Of The Box Her Hair Was In Place And Everything Was Perfect! She's Really Pretty! Prettier Than In The Picture They Show! If Your Daughter or Yourself Want This I Definetly Recommend That You Get This! You Won't Regret It!
B0073Q0IY2|5.0|They really did a pretty good job of keeping with the feel, the storyline and creep factor in this prequel.  You don't really get exactly how it dovetails with the original until very late in the movie, and that's a good thing.  Lets it stand on its own in a way.<br /><br />Five stars may be pushing it a little, but I'd give the original six, heh.  This is a worthy complement.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Ever since Schwarzenegger went into politics it's been hard for me to watch his movies and Total Recall was one of my favorites. I was so glad to see this remake outdo it's predecessor. Great female characters, great action, awesome computer graphics and of course what makes the movie is Phillip Dick's strange Sci-Fi mind twist that makes one question our concept of reality. It's a fun trippy ride.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|In short, Spielberg at his finest.  We were thrilled from start to finish, even better than it looked in the previews - exotic, full of action, humor, and suspense.  I *will* be getting the BluRay,,,
B00005A8GY|5.0|I really don't understand the criticism of this disc. I have the CD, Sacd, and Vinyl. This Sacd is outstanding! I tend to agree with the other 5 star reviewers on this that possibly it's the equipment that it's being played on. For example, On \\"Oye Como Va\\", the conga strikes are extremely  sharp and clear. The guitar is silky smooth and the soundstage is huge. No need to comment on the music. This and their first album are what Santana is all about. It was all downhill from here. His newer music is ok but IMO no comparison.
B0090EKRKU|3.0|The message is good, and the animation was nice, but does it really take 86 minutes of saying &#34;cutting down too many trees bad&#34; to get that point across?<br /><br />'Horton Hears A Who' was a fantastic adaption that gave even more life to the characters, and some adventure.  This was just, well, boring.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I bought this CPU for my new Build, its crazy fast even without over clocking. I have it paired with a Sapphire Radeon 7770, games are super smooth and fast. For everyday use this chip is worth every penny. I have no regrets.
B0000019PA|5.0|There is a reason so many people discuss their experience with this album in spiritual terms. If you are open to it, the incredibly personal music contained therein will devastate you. The album is quirky and at times opaque, because it offers a glimpse inside one man's mind--one not so terribly ordered, by the way. But the themes are clear, and they're nothing less than life and death and love and evil and redemption. The music and lyrics are, at turns, silly, profound, horrific, beautiful, transformative.<br /><br />This is an album that really touches something deep within, if you let it. Believe the hype.<br /><br />When Mangum sings, &#34;And now she knows she'll never be afraid,&#34; in that creaky voice, soaring high...it's a moment of pure joy and triumph. If you aren't moved, you're not listening.<br /><br />A masterpiece.
B003Z4JQIA|5.0|Bought for my husband... I bought the first one too. He really loves it and the first one lasted 7 years.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Oh my goodness ... if you are a dog lover, you have to watch this movie.  It's a true story, too.  Well-played by Richard Gere, but the real star of the story is the Akita who plays Hachi.  Will make you want to hug your dog!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I eagerly await all of Nelson DeMille's books.  This was worth the wait.  Lots of his great humor.  Moved at a fast pace.  Would definitely recommend the book.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Really unique voice. I just love this Gal's music! She has such a haunting voice. I like every one of these tracks.
B0006JGFNQ|1.0|I bought this for my sons for Christmas. For starters, someone left it on and the batteries were corroded. It worked before I wrapped it. I turned it off. A few minutes later, when the kids unwrapped it, it no longer worked. I've tried everything and NOTHING! IT DOESN'T WORK! The kids were so disappointed. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|What can I say about Bob Marley that hasn't already been said?! He was great! And this double CD set contains some of his best stuff!  One of the best music choices I've made. If you like Reggae, by all means get this one!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|This is an awesome series and I'm glad I went ahead and bought the item despite some of the reviews about the music being cut out of the show. This is not the case, the music is still very much a part of the series. If you love Dawson's Creek you will not be disappointed with this item!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Just what to expect from a Bourne movie, it was delightful.  Keeps you involved from the beginning to the end.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works great for the money. Does the job and is very convenient. A very good tool when on the go!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It was exactly what I was looking for. Looks great. Price nice and quality. I glad for my purchase. Recommend.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Love this book. It is great to read aloud. Kids love it! Great pics to look thru even if you are not reading the words.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Don't be intimidated by the length of this book; it reads fast! Enthralling semi-autobiographical tale that seems farfetched until you read the author's bio. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!
B005LAII62|5.0|I saw it one time with my family onDemand, and I was in love. I bought it off Amazon and it shipped very fast and  I must say I'm very happy. The movie is a little scary for both kids and adults (my 28 year old sister was afraid of the zombies) and it invoked so much emotion. Norman is truly a loveable, adorable, and beautiful character! I just can't get enough of him! I'll give it a 10 out of 5 stars!!
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|My son 17 and just loves mario. My son a senior and friends make night a game night.<br />They all get different games and share. I was stuned, yet keeps a 17 yr old attention.<br />Thank you
B007SGM084|5.0|This is an excellent trilogy combining sex, suspense, and love with a good story line; it was a mistake to hype this as sex for housewives.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This App is horrible. It will only display a few recent posts and is unacceptable when you are only able to get on occasionally!!!
0740785508|5.0|Maravilhoso!<br />Atenderam em todos oos aspectos a minha expectativa, e ainda chegou antes do natal.<br />Vou comprar MUITOS e muitos livros com vocês!
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Take a photo of a document with your phone and you end up with a photo of a document.  CamScanner converts that photo into a PDF file.  Once you try the free version, you WILL pay for the paid version!  It's just that good!
0740797719|5.0|Primeira de muitas compras! Com absoluta certeza é a melhor compra que fiz pela internet. Parabéns! Estou bastante feliz e aprendendo bastante!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simple to play and very entertaining. I see no down side. It runs smoothly and does not freeze. Just don't get addicted.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Best point and click game I've played on Android so far! Don't forget to play the bonus chapter also.... 5 stars!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|First kindle.  Awesome how easy it is to send books to a kindle.  I will buy more of these books.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The plot was derivative of past Bournes. Further, it never grabs you.  I never found myself wondering what would happen next.  Basically, it lacked any real tension.  While it was good that they tried to tie in the previous Bourne plots, they didn't clearly delineate early whether this was a replacement, like Bond, or a new character.  I would recommend that you should wait and watch it on free TV.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This was something my nephew ask for as his Christmas.  He was very happy and I had an easy time getting if for him.
B009KKLQVS|1.0|I'm 56. SoCal native. Grew-up with and around the Beach Boys. Like so many of you, the Beach Boys have been the soundtrack for my life, good times and bad. Young and not-so-young.<br /><br />I was THRILLED when they played the Grammys and the new album and reunion tour was announced. It was like someone threw a switch and some dark, forgotten place in my heart/soul lit back up again. I got TWGMTR the day it was released and listened for DAYS until I loved every track.<br /><br />When the Anniversary Tour tickets went on sale I got set up for TWO of the Tour stops: Provo, Utah for Stadium of Fire on the 4th of July, and five days later, Red Rocks outside Denver. (side note: I had never attended a concert at Red Rocks, but it has been on my 'bucket list' for decades).<br /><br />The night of July 9th was UNBELIEVABLE. The venue nestled into those red rocks almost defies description and it was going to be SRO. There were signs everywhere proclaiming the show was being filmed for a DVD. Then band came out and we found out HOW special it was going to be: many of the band's family members and lifelong friends and fans had flown in from Cali and other places to be there. Women were introduced to the crowd who had been the inspiration for several of the classic BB hits. Mike told the crowd to get comfortable because they were going to play over 50 songs (I think it ended-up being between 52 and 56).<br /><br />They literally opened-up their catalog and poured it ALL out to us with love. The guys, along with the awesome supporting musicians, sang and played their hearts out and it sounded AWESOME. It was a magical, unforgettable night. The guys talked and interacted back & forth with the audience in between songs. It wasn't rushed. It felt intimate even in the midst of this massive, majestic outdoor amphitheater.<br /><br />Everyone was SO psyched this memory was going to be preserved forever on a concert DVD.<br /><br />So imagine my crushing disappointment when I got thisDVD for Christmas yesterday...played it ONCE and probably will NEVER play it again.<br /><br />I'm not sure what show from the tour this is - but I think it was earlier on before the band really started hitting their stride and peaking during the tour. They don't sound anywhere NEAR how they sounded at Red Rocks on July 9th. There is almost ZERO ENERGY passing back & forth between the band and this audience - IT IS A TOTAL JOKE. Almost NO interaction between songs...just line up a PALTRY 21 songs....omitting MANY of the biggest, classic hits.<br /><br />Somewhere, the producers/directors/marketers of this concert DVD should be ASHAMED of themselves for giving us this TRASH. This DVD in NO way captures the magic I experienced in small degree on July 4th in Provo, and then off-the-charts July 9th at Red Rocks. I can only hope someone smart finally clues in to the goldmine of $$$ they would make world-wide by atoning for this by releasing the ENTIRE RED ROCKS CONCERT as a double (if necessary) DVD. If it was properly, lovingly produced and mastered, it could rival 'The Eagles: Live in Melbourne' which is my gold standard for live concert DVDs.<br /><br />PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS TRASH !!! Hold-out your love & support for the Beach Boys until the powers-that-be have to cave to us and give us the real thing, not this rip-off.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a great album, I really like this band, I think they'll go far! Buy this album and enjoy it!
B00005RDOK|5.0|I got htis for my daughter for christmas. It is prefect and shipped quickly and in pefect condtion. she loved it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is an amazing book and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This book definitely deserves this Newbury medal and I love this author I have already read another book by her but I can't remember what it was called I love her work though!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I hesitated in purchasing Ms. Cornwell's latest book because so many of my favorite author's have become production line writer's.  I have been disappointed more time's than I can say in the last two years by author's whose work has always been top notch and held my interest into the wee hours of the morning.  Crossing my fingers I decided to try one last time.  I am so very glad I did. I will not write a word about the story I will simply say, Do Not Hesitate in purchasing Bone Bed. Ms. Cornwell is again at her best and these days that is a rare thing indeed.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|When I heard about this movie I didn't think much of it. I mean come on the muppets haven't been relevant in years. I loved them as a kid but never thought this remake would be worth the time. I was totally wrong. I sat and watch it with my two sons, ages 7 and 3, and was blown away. The actors really looked like they were enjoying themselves and the story line was very entertaining. My kids love the movie and the music. My youngest asks to watch this movie every day and when I have time I sit and watch it with him. There's something here for old and young.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|In times of stress when authors are producing crap (yes, that is what many publisher's are putting out there with superb quotes that can not possibly be real) and calling their &#34;work&#34; writing!  So far from the truth as to be outside the Milky Way galaxy. My favorite &#34;writer&#34; to call out for this is James Patterson.  Tom Wolfe's work is indeed worthy of another go 'round if you do not care for the classics and if you do care for the classics as well. I have read Bonfire so many times that my hardcover has pages falling out. Downloading it to my Kindle was well worth it. Still fascinating and worth the time to read and savor every page. I've read all his books but there is something about our current political climate that makes Bonfire a very fitting read! If you've not read Mr. Wolfe before, may I suggest you start with this book. I doubt you will be disappointed!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|...just don't expect to get guidance on how to keep graphics formatted properly.  On the other hand, if you are just publishing text, its helpful, but not really necessary.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This was the best book Jeff Kinney has ever written actually this is the best book I've ever read and I'm looking forward to reading the next book Jeff Kinney is going to write and I hope that he will write more dairy of a wimpy kid books.
0786955570|5.0|First, I bought this game for half the price during a great deal Amazon had.  It was just under 29$.  Second, the game is complete, brand new and there is SO MUCH TO IT!<br /><br />40 dungeon tiles<br />5 Heroes<br />Lots of cards and tokens that can be used to make the game go in several directions!<br /><br />In my opinion playing with others is more fun than just playing by yourself, however, this game is so random that playing by yourself can get very exciting!<br /><br />It has a D&D 4th edition feeling and games can be as short as 15 minutes and up to 1+ hour.  The over all difficulty is however you decide.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!
B0058SNI58|5.0|Needed a versatile shoe for a trip to Florida and these were perfect.  Comfortable, lightweight and cute.  In fact my daughter just borrowed them for her trip.  Can wear them to the beach, amusement parks, shopping trips and casual dinners.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Bought this for my grandkids to watch.  They enjoyed it as much as I did as a younger person.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|gave me just what i was looking for, local right in my own little town,was nothing i didn't like about it
0439023521|5.0|Bought this for my wife before I got her a Nook Color.  She thoroughly enjoyed this book, and couldn't wait for the movie.  She would recommend this book to anyone.
B003U80I5G|1.0|I really thought there wasn't a version of Jane Eyre that I couldn't at least like if not love.  Well now I found one.  I found 'Jane' to be a complete doe-eyed idiot & Rochester oh my dear Rochester...  George Scott butchered the hard, ill-tempered man I have come to love.  I paid $0.99 for it at Walmart but I still feel a little cheated. lol  But seriously this was the worst version I have ever scene.  Watch the ones with Ciaran Hinds, Timothy Dalton, or any other version!!!!
B004G6009K|5.0|When we got our 3D TV, we promised the grandchildren we would get one 3D movie for wach at Christmas.  Kadi loves Tangled, so this was her choice.  It is a fun movie, and has some great 3D.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Very vulgar movie, but if you're comfortable with that kind of language you will absolutely love this film. It is hilarious and Mark and Mila do a great job in it. One of Seth's best works in my opinion.
1419701533|5.0|I always encourage my grandchildren to read, so when my granddaughter showed interest in the Wimpy Kids books, I decided to get all of them in one box set.  Nice set, and she loved them, so I would recommned this to anyone with children or grandchildren.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very funny and great movie to watch with friends or family (if kids are older). Definitely recommend watching it if you like music numbers.
1250027624|5.0|This was a gift for a co-worker that is a big Downton Abbey fan.  She and her husband both enjoyed the book.  I would recommend this for any Downton Abbey fan.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I love this.  So far every technique I've tried has been stupendous.  I recommend this to all who eat and if you like to cook as well, it's a God-send.
B00932AA5G|5.0|This is movie-making at its best.  Great plot (thanks to that Norwegian mystery-writing genius, Jo Nesbo);  great acting; great directing; great cinematography; great editing; great casting!  Everything about this suspenseful thriller is genius! Don't miss it!  No thriller/suspense/mystery I have ever seen tops this one -- including all of Hitchcock, the Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, Silence of the Lambs, Girl with the Dragon Tatoo series.  Most aren't this good -- and none is better.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is one of the best by John Grisham.He never fails to entertain. Cannot wait to read all the others.
067003830X|5.0|I teach psychology courses at the college level and frequently refer to this book in my discussions and lectures. The true stories that are provided as examples of how the brain is capable of healing are astounding! I often recommend this book to those who are interested in reading about neuroplasticity.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have allways loved playing solitare and I would recommend it to all.  It's fun and intertaining for all ages
B009POHHRG|4.0|This was a good read, but part of me wished for a less ambiguous ending! Overall, the story is compelling as an examination of morality in our society, but I believe Moore's treatment of Batman lacked development. I would definitely recommend this graphic novel to other Batman fans, but warn that it is Joker's story not Batman's.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My wife had this app on her phone and I liked it plus it was free I would recommend it for my grandchildren
B009E3EY38|5.0|Celebration Day is a great video. I love these guys!....they still got IT!!  And the price was not bad either...
0792839749|5.0|Was looking for old movies for my grandchildren for christmas. This fit the bill. Arrived on time to have for Christmas. Thanks
B003R50AW8|4.0|If you are looking for something totally different to the normal fare this book is for you.  Great character development in what is generally a feel good story.  Perhaps not quite as good as The Book Thief, but definitely worth reading.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great for basic review of android files.  Not a root explorer, but it serves my needs as an Android user.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not sure that this app on my phone or my Kindle Fire HD is the greatest...I have to have it on my phone but for the kindle I just prefer to use my computer
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|If the actors weren't Mark Walberg and Mila Kunis this would have been a 3 star. They saved the film.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|La calidad de los productos, la diversidad y exclusividad en los formatos de audio (grabaciones inéditas, formato tradicional, formato SACD) y los accesorios contenidos son una excelente opción para quienes somos fanáticos y coleccionistas del legado de Pink Floyd.
B0098460O4|5.0|I'm new to this genre. I have the personality of a brick. I'm a perfectionist who is hard to impress. This Jonathan and Charlotte caused tears to stream down my face when listening to \\"il mondo e nostro,\\" even though I don't know what they're saying... I haven't cried in a decade and a song made me bloody cry. Rare is the artist(s) who gives you goosebumps, puts your heart in your throat, temporarily rips you out of your anxious/terrified/manic reality so you can feel again, affirming that you are alive. Whole cd is awesome. Charlotte's voice is sweet & soothing, while Jonathan comes in like rolling thunder then explodes, like a bloody bomb, with that voice of his... blown away I am... bloody blown out of my tree. Can't wait for more... inspirational.
B001I10ABO|4.0|Without doubt this is one of the icon albums of Metallica ... I have it in different formats and waited enough to get it on vinyl ... and although it is a remastered version taken from a 320 mbps pm3 format, the sound is too &#34;digital&#34; and lost some quality &#34;analogous&#34; we seek in the vinyl; rather than listening to a vinyl, it has the feeling of listening to a recording on an audio mp3 equalizer too.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Play this a lot but it would be nice if I could play it with my screen facing any direction. I am completely addicted to this game
B004ZNB12O|4.0|La colección de temas en este CD es muy buena si viene del legado de Pink Floyd, aunque no ofrece mucha novedad respecto de la colección Echoes.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very technical, but very interesting.  Could provide less complicated substitution recipes for the wheat, but overall fascinating theory...will keep you posted on the weight loss piece!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|instant face book at a touch.works great on my kindle fire and kindle fire hd.allows use of the hidden camera on the kindle fire hd to post on fb!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I ordered this and received it quickly, the blu rays all play perfectly. What I was surprised to find is that this also included a code to get digital copies of the movie through the ultraviolet program. I had no idea it included that. Now the digital copies are standard def, but that's still pretty cool having digital access.<br /><br />The movies themselves are complete, it comes with a little book which is nice but the movies are what I wanted. Everything played perfectly, the sound was great and picture was clear.
0062127241|5.0|I have not even read it yet but I know I'll be pleased.It was a gift for a family member and he was very excited.
0316227706|5.0|As a lifelong fan of and owner of dogs, I was delighted with this book. Even for people who aren't dog fans, I think it would be downright bizarre for anybody to not take pleasure in this hilarious collection of photos. It's just plain funny! I love to look at the odd ways in which the dogs were captured on photo during their submersible adventures.<br /><br />The resolution is top notch, showing every tiny bubble and every strand of misplaced fur. The quality of the book is also excellent, with thick, glossy pages of rich color, along with solid binding. Labrador fans (like me) will be particularly pleased, since there is a high proportion of their goofy-faced number in the collection (which makes sense, given their love for water), but other breeds get their time in the sun (er, pool, that is), as well!
030759565X|5.0|I bought this cookbook for my wife on pre-order. When it arrived my wife was \\"smitten\\" by it. She has already made several of the dishes and they were wonderful. This is truly a cookbook that can be used for more than a reference. We have suggested it to a number of people. I know of at least two who have bought it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|First app downloaded on my Kindle Fire and wife my daughter loves playing this game. So much so, now my wife wants a Fire.
B0007OASII|4.0|I listened to this cd and liked what i heard. I am gonna try some new tunes out along with this one.
B008476HBM|5.0|Excellent Book!!!! Great read for the holidays--Jane Austen knows how to tell a love story/  Order it now for some reading pleasure.
B006ZT47O0|4.0|Just thought I would try some new music out and gave this one a try. So far its ok not quite as good as some others I have heard but its not bad.
B009VL28W2|5.0|What a great show full of energy. Metallica kick ass still and they are keeping real music alive! Metallica does it again.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|I thought I would give this a try. Listening to new music. This one is ok I liked some of the others a little better.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm not going to give you a movie review on these three films. Obviously, if you are searching the Dark Knight trilogy for purchase, I would assume you are a fan of the movies. I pre-ordered the trilogy before the release date on Amazon, without really comparing prices on other sites, because I know Amazon would have the lowest price guarantee. Well, I realized after it came out, the price on Amazon went down by $2. I thought it was odd that the price dipped after release, but soon I got a email from Amazon saying that it was providing me a $2 refund. In the end it's only $2, but it's the little things like this that has me coming back to Amazon for most of my purchasing needs.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|i heard this from a freind who had it and i absolutly loved it so i bought one for my self.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|As a long-time fan of Preston-Child and the Pendergast series, I looked forward to a familiar and exciting reading experience.  The premise of the tale is good, and is a continuation of the Pendergast saga.  However, I found the opening chapters almost completely unbelievable (I realize one must exercise a certain suspension of disbelief when reading these stories) and choppy.  But what was most distracting was the irrelevant insertion of two almost completely unrelated stories featuring different (if familiar from past works) characters.  These insertions broke up the narrative of the main story, and in my view served only as fillers to increase the book to standard novel length.  The climactic events in Brazil were well done and more of what one has come to expect from the wonderful writing duo.
B00337KM2S|3.0|bought this as a gift. person i got it for was very pleased with the product. ordered a 2nd one for someone else as a gift.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My son loves Austin & Ally and loves singing along with Ross Lynch... He is a very happy boy with this cd.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|this one yet another gift for my wife and she loved it. i bought some others as well and they were just as good.
B004EK926K|5.0|A movie that focuses on the true meaning of Christmas! A Classic Christmas movie that should be part of every Christmas collection. A must-see film.
0143038419|5.0|Loved this book!  Was really inspiring!  Makes me want to drop everything and go traveling around the world to experience more!
0770433782|5.0|I absolutely adored this book! I'm a fan of SMP the blog but the book was a breath of fresh air. I loved that there were weddings that I had not seen before. Hope there will be a part two!
B000002IHU|5.0|Bought as a gift and if the person is into 80s music this is a good one that isn't going anywhere!
1416575464|5.0|I love this go to guide...many of us don't have all of the Domino magazines saved and this gives the best of all the magazine in one place. I enjoy referring back to it for decor inspiration and ideas. It definitely is worth the purchase.
0817439390|5.0|My daughter asked for this book for Christmas and was excited about getting it. She says it was  highly recommended
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is EXTREMELY hilarious and is probably one of the best out of the series!!! I have all of the books, and surely this will be the next I'll get!
B00112ASYO|5.0|It is just what I wanted to give my grandson. SOOOO realistic. He loves it. I would recommend the Schleich animals above all others
B009IU6BIS|5.0|This movie is a family tradition in our household. I can't imagine a Christmas Holiday without sitting as a family and enjoying this movie.  It's not deep, it's not rocket-science, it just makes you laugh and relate to the stress of the season while reinforcing the Holidays are meant for family -time.....regardless of how functional they may or may not be.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as a gift. She has not said one way or the other whether she likes it
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Still trying to figure out how to actually use the camera/video for any purpose other than Facetime.  Without a viewfinder on Kindle Fire, difficult to see what you are videoing by just holding the Kindle in front of you and not being able to see what you are/aren't capturing.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Hi I am loving this game I got my kindle today and have been playing this since. I hope for mire keep up the good work.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I had to watch this movie at least twice to fully understand all the details.<br /><br />There is a good plot and fun humor throughout. There is a lot to say about friendship and the truth as well.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|App crashes when I select the camcorder option. Is there a button to get a refund? Most of the apps are not free they are trial... not happy
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Not only do I have autism in my family I work at a school with autistic students. I found this DVD profound in teaching me how the brain of an autistic individual works. Temple was bold is expressing her life and feelings in this true to live story.<br /><br />To deeply understand how autistic people process information, you must watch the movie again with Temple's commentary. Wow! Eye opening, enlightening, engaging and exposing! This DVD is a must!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Great game....the graphics, music look and feel all brings me back to my youth....absolutely worth the download if you've played Crusin' USA or a game of the kind in your childhood....great work with minimal permissions....every game should be this good.

0321885112|5.0|I started sketchnoting about a year ago, and this book is the resource that I wish I had when I started out.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in incorporating more visuals into their note taking process.  First, some context.  I am not a trained artist, just an avid learner who was looking for a way to process and remember cool ideas that I encountered in books, videos, and podcasts.  That's what drew me into sketchnoting a year ago, and my enthusiasm has only grown since then.  This book provides a framework to get you up and running with sketchnoting, exercises to build your skills, and tons of awesome examples to inspire your own work.  The book is so beautifully illustrated that you will return to it often and gain new insight each time.  As I continue my own personal journey with sketchnoting, this is the book that I will return to many times a year to help me figure out how to take my work to the next level. No matter your current level of experience, you will benefit greatly from reading this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Addictive show.  Impossible to watch just one episode at a time.  I highly recommend it.  But it's definitely not for kids.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I figured it was just the Google Search Engine, but it is more than that.  That might be good for some people, but I just want the Google search engine.  It is overprogrammed and not well thought out.  Just give me Google.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|this CD and Christmas music makes you feel like Michael is right there in your home. loved every song for sure
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I had my kindle for a year before getting this case, I'd always had a poly-type shell.  I was afraid it would be bulky but it's actually very sleek.  It feels good and works well.
B0086DBE62|5.0|Way better than snow white and the huntsman. Probably be cause the actress has more than one expression. J j
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I bought this book a few hours ago. My plan was to read one chapter and then go to sleep. Needless to say, I read the whole book in one sitting.<br /><br />I was immediately drawn to every character in this book. Hazel is a tough but incredibly human protagonist. I fell in love with Augustus instantly. Even the more deplorable characters have their better moments.<br /><br />No other author I've come across can make me laugh like John Green can. No other author can make me cry like John Green can. And no author today makes me think quite like Green does.<br /><br />Whether Nerdfighter or someone who just randomly stumbled upon this book, TFIOS is well worth the read.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|REALLY liked this movie. B b BBB BBB b b b b b b gv gg gv. Stupid limits. :p
0060531053|5.0|This is the best book we've read on home brewing by far!  A friend suggested it and we are so glad.  It's easy to read, has cool diagrams and very helpful!  Can't wait to taste our beer in 4 weeks!!
B001706I5I|5.0|Love Jim in everything. Watched it on Christmas with my family for the millionth time. My dad really liked it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book.I actually never expected it to be this good thank you for your wonderful writing in novels. :)
0822493551|5.0|Get this classic awesome book. It is a must for any collector<br />of classic stories. Kids and adults will like to read it.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I liked this book because when ever we are trying to figure out a word that we don't know we can look at the definitions of  the word and find out what the word of that definition means.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The newsfeed only shows the 10 most recent posts and nothing else will load. Seems to be a widely reported problem for 2 months with no fix.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|If you love a book where there are laughs and strangeness, then you will love this book. It`s about Greg who has a dance, also his uncle starts living with him. I give this a four star rating. This is a must read book.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Excellent movie to snuggle up and watch on Christmas Eve  - both for kids and parents alike - while awaiting for Santa Claus to bring a Christmas Magic to your home.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|What can I say about the masterpiece of a genius such as Dickens?  I have read A CHRISTMAS CAROL for ten years running on the five nights before Christmas.  This edition with it's beautiful illustrations is terrific for setting the mood of that most special Holiday!
B008NABUU8|5.0|This game is really good you should get this game you would like it a lot you really would like it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm a huge Clancy fan, I've read everyone of his novels. I'm about 1/3 into Threat Vector and it's like I can't put it down. I LOVE his writing style and his detail description of all the technical things. He's great at linking the characters through the novels
B004GBFF5Y|5.0|Good movie with good story line. Just what I expected from this, good story line with live issues. Not a typical Hollywood movie.
B007STXHTM|5.0|This case is a must have if you want to do away with the bubbled look of videos while scuba diving. I added the red filter as well to capture great footage in Cancun.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it had some really memorable action scenes but it dragged a little in parts. It's an overall good movie night pick though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My son and I read this cover to cover rather quickly. I have to say, the book is far better than the movie.
B0099G3I96|2.0|The only thing remaining from No Doubt's original sound is Stefani's distinctive voice. The rest of this album could be any mindless pop group of today.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Bought this DVD series without having even seen it - now there was a leap of faith!  At first my husband did not care for it but we stuck with it and by the time we were less than half through the first season we both were captivated and loved it.  We look forward to the next season to be released.  This series is resplendent with beautiful costumes, sets and fine acting.  The whole idea of the series was so novel that you might be put off by a fairy tale that is taken seriously but it really sucks you in quickly because the acting is so good.  The evil queen Regina played by Lana Parilla is outstanding but the actor who really steals the show is Robert Carlyle who plays Mr Gold or Rumpelstiltskin - absolute perfection!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|My husband and I haven't had a chance to watch it during Christmas but we are planning to sit down on the week end and watch it.  Our daughter has had nothing but praise for this show.  Loved the 2 day shipping.  Thanks
0670022950|5.0|Steven Pinker writes on a different subject. I was a little concerned if it would be as good as his other books. but the moment I began to read it , all concerns were thrown away. He has lots of useful data and reasonings to back his hypotheses.
2877142965|5.0|bought this as a present for a friend and she LOVED IT. the book was worn out, but thats exactly how I wanted it. It looked used and loved but not damaged. And, of course, it is a great story so five stars to the author as well. shipping was not fast but also not slow either, if you are buying this for a special day I recommend buying it within a reasonable time.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|WE ALWAYS LAUGH FROM THE BEGINNING TILL THE END OF ALL THE ICE AGE MOVIES. IT'S A PLEASURE TO WATCH A MOVIE WITH YOUR FAMILY WITHOUT THE WORRY OF BAD LANGUAGE, SEX SCENES AND VIOLENCE! MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THESE PLEASE AND THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER ICE AGE WELL DONE!!
B0097EWK3A|3.0|It's rather difficult to navigate without using the &#34;hints&#34; button.  However, you aren't penalized for using a hint.<br />The graphics are amazing, and the hidden objects are challenging to find.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Wonderful book; vanity is a terrible thing. Read this book, the classics are worth reading especially when you don't have to.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Movie arrived on time and was as described.  Story is suitable for all ages and types of children (and adults).  Nice holiday/ Christmas themed story.
B005974C94|5.0|The DVD definitely adds to the experience.  Great stuff, especially if you like Dixieland and early blues.  The musicians clearly are on the same wavelength.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|Movie arrived quickly and was as described.  My 14 yo stepson LOVES this movie and its story and meaning.  Very nice product.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Entertaining and well-acted by Mr. Depp. Special effects are excellent and the plot line interesting. This movie would be a good alternative to an evening of TV re-runs.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|a good read for the beach or gym - very funny - Mindy Kalings book is also similarly funny and worth buying.  I woudnt, however, spend the extra for the kindle version - MUCH more expensive than the original hard copy.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|The best description of this movie is &#34;terrible&#34;. The plot was weak, the dialogue was flat and it appeared that the director gave the actors some broad brush premise to work with and then told them to ad-lib the lines.
B008Y7J1Y2|4.0|This movie has become one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies.  Kate Winslet (Iris) is one of my favorite actresses and I think Cameron Diaz (Amanda) is great when she is given the right role as she has been here. Cameron has great chemistry with Jude Law who is terrific as the romantic lead, Graham.  The sets are beautiful.  Iris' cottage is dreamy and cozy and Amanda's house is fantastic.  Iris' journey of self-discovery is not the typical romance.  She has to learn to love herself and she is helped on her journey by her elderly neighbor who tells her that she needs to be the leading lady in her life.  I personally feel like Iris' story is a little more painful to watch than Amanda's.  Watching Amanda and Graham fall in love is a lot of fun.  I don't want to spoil too much but my favorite part of the movie is the scene in the tent. I think the story is well-told.  I really like the movie trailer voice-over.  Even with this sort of device I didn't feel like I was having to make concessions to believe the story. I watch this movie every time it is on TV so I just decided to buy it.  I rarely buy movies so the fact that I purchased this one is a very high form of praise.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy at his best. Timing for  the plot of this book couldn't have been any better. Clancy's technical knowledge and research is excellent
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I had some reservation when I noticed it's an 1989 movie. Without all Hollywood special effect, how good could it possibly be? But I was wrong. It's a warm heart movie that fits the holiday season the best. It's funny from beginning till the end and it reminded my usual Christmas gathering with my grandparents, parents, uncles and cousins. Just enjoy it!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Cute story that offers a view of Christmas from an overly commercial point of view showing that all the technology in the world should change the fundamental spirit of Christmas.
096798467X|5.0|I and my frends loved it, so good illustrated easy to understand, and we are going to have lot of fun when we start ouer prodjekts in the spring, so yes this was suprising good one
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I different take on a classic. Good clean enertainment. The action scenes were well done. I fould myself rooting for Snow White.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome, this book is so awesome. I enjoy this book while reading it. You should reed it or you are wierd .
B000F8O35U|5.0|I enjoyed The Little Mermaid and it brought back a lot of childhood memories. It arrived within a week of me ordering it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Enjoy this app as an adult and Sure it would be loved by kids.<br />Would recommend it for all ages.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This is a great Christmas story for the techno-weenie kid who asks all kind of questions about Christmas. In this updated tale, British accent Santa delivers all of his toys via a futuristic spaceship looking vehicle piloted by his son Steve. His other son, Arthur diligently answers the mail. After a successful Christmas, it was discovered that one toy was overlooked.<br /><br />While Santa and Steve don't fret over the situation, Arthur and Grandsanta take on the quest the traditional way with a host of reindeer, whose names Grandsanta can't quite remember.<br /><br />This is a funny and heart warming story kids and adults can both enjoy. I was pleasantly surprised in spite of the fact it ignored time zones.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great is mildly describing this book.  Much better than the movie.  Need nine more words to finish this review. Goodbye
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I wish I could high-five the developers for so lovingly crafting this game.  I doubt that even Sega themselves could do better by bringing an official OutRun game to Android.<br /><br />P.S. If you think the graphics could be better, then go download an Asphalt or Need for Speed game instead, because you are completely missing the point.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Stupid vvvv w a an d th Garth sights kids dead home t uhh vs Jeff tutti added Assad asks
B003O86FMW|4.0|Keeps a hold on you. Twist and turns on every page. I think I enjoyed it a little more than the first one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is perhaps one of the most thoughtful pieces of literature I have ever had the great pleasure of reading. The Fault in Our Stars causes one to pause for hours on end and reflect on what they have just read. The metaphorical and symbolic resonances are astounding. It seems John Green continues to be an amazing intellectual and most authors can only childishly dream of aspiring to such heights of literary genius.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My eight-year-old grandson loves Angry Birds games, so he was very happy with this. It needs to be played on a firm surface because it just doesn't work well on a carpet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I FOUND THIS BOOK EXCITING.  WANTED TO KEEP READING TO SEE THE FINAL OUTCOME.<br />Would recommend it to other readers.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I love Les Miserables, and couldn't wait to see the movie.  I actually saw to today, but bought the soundtrack first.  I'm glad to say that the movie is better than this led me to believe it would be.  It's not that these versions of the songs are bad per se, but they are designed to be more personal, more intimate, and are more tied to the visuals of the actors than the stage production soundtracks.  How a song works in context of a film doesn't always translate to later, and this is a clear case of that.  If you loved the movie and want to listen to the amazing songs, try the Original London Cast.  Some of the synthesizers are a titch dated now, but the vocal performances from that production have never been matched.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|There is a huge variety of mini games to choose from. You can keep track of your progress, and it's easy to see your improvements. It does not take a big time commitment; you can simply take ninety seconds to play one little game, and you can still improve your brain's performance. I love it!
B008EQIEWS|3.0|It was the usual mythological drama of course but excelled due to some of the best leading men!  The graphices and pyrotechnics were awesome!  Too much variation in sound though; growls and explosions over the top and dialog sometimes whispered and unintelligible...had to keep the volume moving line a roller-coaster.  The Cast was great but the over all product was a let down. I probably would not recommend
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Wow. That book was so good and really emotional too I now want to watch the movie to see if they did the book justice
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This movie is so amazing! It makes you feel like you are at the concert yourself. They sing many songs, and do pretty funny stuff! Just don't get if you don't enjoy 1D or their music. Very good!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great family Christmas movie. Very funny.  Will Farrell and the rest of the cast is great.  Highly recommend this movie.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very challenging and fun. Helps pass the time and absolutely adorable graphics. Glad to get this free, but like another reviewer said it's worth the price!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very addictive. It has become my granddaughter's new favorite. Very challenging and engaging  great new game edition.
B000BFNAYC|5.0|I watched a Karcher video  on water sandblasting and what a professional finish this left on aluminum rims and it provided a very nice biting finish so my rim paint would stick.
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far a game to play that doesn't require friends to play or money. I look forward to playing more.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|This is one of the dumbest movies besides district 9 this one sucks same category do not buy you will not like it.
B001706I5I|3.0|Funny in places, but pretty different from Dr. Seuss' tale. Probably good for the middle-elementary or middle school crowd, but my 1st grader didn't like it.
6305433909|5.0|I love Whoopi Goldberg and this 2nd sister act  is really great of course the 1st one is original but the 2nd one is very good and it will make you laugh.
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is very fun and addictive. It does lag a bit, but it's quite rare (At least on my device). It's free, which makes it even better. Get this app!
B00005QGAX|5.0|I love the mega mind movie so much but I wanted the original  album that one of the songs came off of so I bought this extra because I like Michael Jackson's bad.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|This app impressed me. I knocked a star off because the timing is a bit off. It's really fun though. Good time killer.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I love this movie and from now on I buy Blu-ray if the movie is great and if not stick with DVD but this is worth it for this film.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|This was very much a Batman movie. I can't give away too much without spoilers, but it was fun to watch. How they made it 2 hours and 45 minutes long is another question. I think by now, we pretty much understand the motivation of the characters.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A fitting end to the Helen Esterhazy Pendergast trilogy, leaving the door open for another series with Special Agent Pendergast.  Can't wait to see where Alban turns up next.  Diogenes reincarnated!!!
B005K15SPG|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever listened to.  I will keep it forever and purchase all of the other CDs put out by Mumford and Sons.  I wish them the best!
1439153663|5.0|I hope there is a sequel.  This book would make a wonderful movie and it certainly was a great discussion book for our book Club.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I played the instant video using my computer wi-fi connected to my tv. The video ran smoothly, excellent quality.<br /><br />I love this movie.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|Love to watch this movie with the family on a regular basis.  You won't be dissappointed.  It's good for all ages.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am happy that i watched the movie first for this one, or it would not have been as fast of a read for me, but i still had a really hard time putting it down.
B0076DELIG|1.0|When I saw the Kindle price was higher than the paperback I decided not to purchase the book. The publisher should be ashamed to rip off the public charging more for a product that they do not have to print or distribute. I will never knowingly purchase a Kindle book whose price is higher than the paperback or hard cover.
B004SDEP38|5.0|i like it because of word and pdf. i would let a friend know about it. good job and price
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love Stephen King!  I loved this book but was sad with the way it ended. Overall it was  a good read.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|its probably good for people who know how to put it to use. but i dont, i downloaded it and still cant get video on my kindle hd
B0063M22QO|3.0|An okay game, but not as user friendly and challenging as other Mahjong games I have played on the computer.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Really appreciate the specials that Amazon has. $0.99 for Legend is a steal. Slowly replenishing my collection that melted int he back of my car in the 80s
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie is my number 1 best relationship film. It has its twist and turns its ups and downs and the ending was just perfect. It truly shows you how strong love really is.
B003YUSNBG|5.0|Nice and confortable shoes, look amazing with jeans, very light, you can go sundays to the mall with your family and friends and walk over for hours. Good materials. I would bay another pair of this.
B00ANAC32U|1.0|This product is not even worth the 20 dollars it costs direct from Google (its just a bit of plastic and silicone!) let alone the price that these vultures are selling it for.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Bad movie, only about sex. Shallow, not really getting to real issues. Super sophomoric and low class. Not recommendable, ugly film.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|It's been a while since I've seen it in the movie theater. For a heads up to X-men aficionados, this Origins follows the Ultimate X-men story arc, instead of another. So some details do not go with the original explanations.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|4 star rating for comedy. Movie was stupid funny at times, but I like that. Of you like Family Guy, you'll like the movie.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|So heart warming and funny; Will Ferrell does a masterful job.<br /><br />HD makes it more enjoyable<br /><br />It is a yearly tradition.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Is perfect for any one direction fan. I believed that the book was more big, but it is ok. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome read<br />Couldn't stop I got hooked right away this is one of those books which you think is boring but in the middle it just amazes you
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Thank you so much for the cd, my husband loves it!!! It shipped REALLY fast, which was very nice!! All in all, I am a very satisfied customer, and would definitely buy from you again in the future!! Thanks again!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover has totally out-done herself with this one! It's by far the best book I've read all year. I'm hesitant to start a new book because I'm still so caught up in this one. This book will consume your thoughts for days and days! And Holder, oh, Holder!!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|She loves the show.  I have never seen it, but she was excited to receive it as a Christmas present.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Holds the charge very well.  Easy to use and the included adapters and case are nice additions.  Flashlight is handy when I walk the dog at night.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is really nice although I just got a One Direction alarm clock. So I wont be needing it anymore but still really handy.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Action packed, thriller! Daniel Craig doing his own stunts makes Bond more believable than ever before!! Definitely a must see!
B007FQDPL8|5.0|now my collection is up to date :) this show is awesome in blu ray! a definite recommendation for a true blood fan!
B008QMMEOE|4.0|I really like the variety of puzzles they used for this. However the kids get impatient waiting for the next puzzle to come. On the positive side of that comment they let the kids pop bubbles. So it is a give and take approach.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|He managed to surprise me again!  I have read all the Pendergast novels.  This character is so intriguing and likeable.  The action as usual is fast-paced.
B000YHG72E|4.0|good movie to watch with kids during the holidays. My kids found it funny and witty and they liked the snow ball fight
B007MDB71O|5.0|enjoyed it. It got unfair reviews due to critics and fanboys who have no idea of the history of written SF. In fact the y have no knowledge of anything orior to Star Wars/Trek franchises.  The movie also had a terrible marketing campaign.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I purchased this for my husband who is a die hard Phantom fan and has seen the show 8 times with various different casts. We initially rented this from RedBox and fell in love with it. In my opinion, when they put together the Phantom movie and other various anniversaries, they kind of miscast some parts and it can be a let down. In this production, Sierra, Ramin and Hadley are PERFECT!! Casting was well done and the costumes and staging are phenomenal!<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are great too. This was a great gift for my husband and he has been obsessed with it even since I got it for him!
B0046MOVD0|4.0|RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE looks wonderful on Blu-Ray--sounds great too.  Unfortunately, the film lacks some of the verve and heft of the earlier films.  Mila Jovovich and Ali Larter are good--but the film seems tired--as if there's nowhere new to go in the series.  Don't get me wrong, it's still fun--it's just not quite as much fun as the earlier films in the series.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Great family movie. Four kids under 13, all understood.  Book goes into more detail, but the movie pretty much nails it.
B008AT71WI|5.0|LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS has always been a rather under-rated film.  Everyone on Earth has seen the Roger Corman version--this one is seldom seen, a musical without a big enough audience.<br />This Blu-Ray, however, is sharp, clear, and has brilliant sound--usually enough for any film--but this Director's Cut includes the original ending filmed by Frank Oz--in color!  That ending corresponds to the end of the off-Broadway play--with the plant winning and conquering the world!<br />Nice film, great print, wonderful additions to the ending--buy it now!
B007V65R54|4.0|I thought that some sections were excellent, particularly when using baseball metrics to flesh out the concepts.  Some of the middle chapters were quite dry and I had a flashback that I was reading  my statistics for social sciences textbook again.<br /><br />Over all it was excellent and easy to see why Silver was so accurate in rating the general election.  Great concepts and practical advice in looking at stat data.<br /><br />Well worth the effort.
B007XF0X16|4.0|I wasn't a huge fan of the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS.  I believed the Harryhausen version told the same story in a slightly better way--and I thought the CGI monsters lacked the life of Harryhausen's stop-motion examples.<br />This film, then, took me by surprise.  First, the storyline really does work--building on the characters and ideas of the first film and following through with the main theme of the death of the Gods.<br />The effects work is also superior--with more weight and depth than the previous film.  The fact that it was actually filmed in 3-D and not retrofitted also means that the picture is brighter and sharper.  A fun film to watch with some nice action.
B007MDB548|5.0|A great movie to watch with a young family. A nice storyline suitable for children and good 3d effects. Enjoyed by all.
0810996596|5.0|This book surprised me in two ways--first, I never expected a slick, full-color book from ABRAMS to be so affordable!  Second, I had no idea that Mr. Hammett had a collection of such scope.  The toys and models are great but his selection of original artwork is amazing!<br />A great book--and a great addition to any Horror collector's library!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is the best story of Batman. You learn about the man behind the mask and how he became. Is this the end of Batman or a new beginning?
B004JMSIRC|5.0|All OK, the product arrived early and OK. I am very happy, these movies are great. . . . .
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love the movie Elf. It has to be a staple in your yearly celebrations. Perfect casting. Good laughs. Great scripting.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|All OK, the product arrived early and OK. I am very happy, these movies are great. . . . .
B008MM9630|5.0|Only thing I don't like is that I can't play the same game on my kindle that I have on my android
B009JBZH54|5.0|All OK, the product arrived early and OK. I am very happy, these movies are great. . . . .
0316019984|5.0|Wow! This is a truly an amazing pop-Up Book! Real light in the city of Gotham? In a book? YES!<br />Details are amazing, great colors, easy to close. Really, if you a pop-up book fan - this one is must have!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Well acted, good storyline.  Fine characters that hold your interest.  Movie is good for all ages.  Great Fun!  Recommended.  Piper Laurie is great as Auntie Em.
B008602KQI|5.0|While the setting is definitely a horrible scenario, the book is gripping and quite a comment on society today - the greed, the oppression, and the &#34;silliness&#34; and fascination with all things fake in &#34;reality&#34;.
B008APX4P0|5.0|Just upgraded myself from a 2006 NEC 20WMGX2 20\\" 6ms AS-IPS display. I had my doubts but this is a great monitor. Great default color, better calibrated color, 10-bit LUT and 8-bit output. 4-7ms GtG, 945:1 static contrast ratio, 0.8ms input lag, no dirty screen AG coating. Perfect AG coating in a semi-gloss style. Eizo quality and backlight uniformity. 99.9% sRBG, 77% Adobe RGB. Sits stably on desk with decent adjustment options. No better game/ photo/ all around display out there. I waited years for something that hits all these notes.
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|I was disappointed - they should have quit after the first Puss n Boots DVD.  This is NOT a keeper.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of Season 2 and was disappointed when it was over.  I'm now looking forward to watching Season 3.  Be sure and check out Season 1 also.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any grown-up.  This was not my husband's type of movie, but it was certainly mine!
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This Bourne movie is a mistake.  Why would you ruin the good franchise with this add-on movie?  Just because Jeremy Lenner is casted doesn't mean the movie will be good.  Ugh.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter, 8 yrs, has played and played this and loves it!  Good game and she loves the graphics. Lots of pets to try to earn, too.  She really likes the content and the pets are ones she can relate to and she owns!  Great for LPS lovers!  Get this app if you are one!
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Please save your money and watch something else. This is gotta be the worst movie of the year.  They should stop this franchise.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|to see how the characters grow and or change in this series is something most tv lacks ...... mustsee this from the beginning
B009GE9Y44|5.0|I viewed this movie on Amazon.  I ended up going out and purchasing the Blu-Ray, because it was that good.  Everything is motion-captured in HD camera, the actions were intense.  I thought it was better than the first CG movie, Degeneration.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is awesome on so many levels. My heart goes out Holder,Karen, and Sky in this book. They are true survivors and conquerors. I did not realize that this book would have tears coming down my eyes so much. Normally in books the female character gets on my nerves at some point in the book but this was not the case in Hopeless. I loved Sky for how she handled being bullied. I even love how she didn't chase after Holder in the beginning for getting upset about the bracelet. Holder was a very sweet guy despite his mood swings. He was a very intelligent young man and very strong for his age. I liked that he didn't take crap from anyone. He loved sky from the moment he laid eyes on her. The twist in this book was so unexpected and so far from what I was thinking. It tore me apart and I could feel every emotion that the characters felt. I love how the author put in glimpses of Sky's past and it made the book come together full circle. This is definitely a book I will read over and over and over again. This is definitely 1 of my favorite books of 2012. They should make this book into a movie. I recommend this book to everyone, it is a good example of how to overcome certain obstacles in your life. If you haven't done so already please get this book and read it before the year is over!!!(less)
B0015AARJI|4.0|I bought this Sony ps3 controller so many times and gained one fact, &#34;always buy this product from big companies&#34;.  Before I purchased this from Amazon I bought twice from other sellers, they both sent me counterfeits !!!  So if u want authentic and original Sony PS3 controllers, always buy them from big companies.<br /><br />Even though nowadays counterfeit controller is very-close-made to the origin, it still can't function well if your game requires delicate operations or motions. (personal experience)  Anyway I'm really glad I bought it from Amazon.com this time.
