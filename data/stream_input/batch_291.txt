0060523794|3.0|I enjoyed the first half of the book a lot. The first couple chapters are very interesting. You can see the story of IBM in the early 90' from Louis's eyes. The author did a good job to summary IBM's problems and environments at that time. They are common problems in many large companies.<br />However, the second half chapters are not interesting any more. The author just repeted many common or general business management best pratices. Not too many new.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I heard this group back in September when I was in Finland on a student exchange.  They played the video on MTV Europe and I noticed that these girls were, or, at least appeared to be, lesbians.  I didn't think much of them until my girlfriend told me that she had bought their CD and it was the best CD she bought in a long time and that she loved it.  So, then I listened to her CD and I had to agree with her.  It was one of the best CD's I have heard in a long time.  Well, my girl-friend's mother tongue is Russian and she bought the Russian version of this album.  And, I have bought the English version of the album before I left the country in mid-December.  Let me tell you that the Russian language version of this album is TEN TIMES better than the English version![.] Don't worry if you can't speak Russian.  All the themes of the songs are similar except for Matchik Gay, which means, Gay boy in Russian.  The Russian version of that song is that the girls are trying to tell a young gay boy to not be afraid and go out and get a boy-friend.  There are also alot of extra songs on the Russian version that were not included on the english version.  But, if you are a big fan of \\"How soon is now\\" then you will be disappointed because it is not included.  To sum it all up, this is a wonderful debut album.  And, if you have the oppurtunity, get the Russian version, but, if not, then just buy the English version.  And by the way, at the beginning of \\"Show me love\\" the girl is saying \\"so what\\" whenever she says \\"nuis stohl.\\"  Then she says, \\"I am an answering machine.\\"

B00006SFLV|5.0|&quot;If everyone did what was in their heart, this world would grind to a halt.&quot; This is just one of the choice bits of philosophy within the few episodes of My So Called Life. If you have an ounce of romance in your soul you will love this program. It's more than just the realistically portrayed problems of teenagers and adults. It is about life itself. The excellent writing and the actors manage to make the viewer understand the points of view of each character--even if not sympathizing with the way they do things. <br />My So Called Life was abruptly taken off the air because it was too advanced for commercial television. Yet its format; its style and the way music is intertwined with the stories has been the inspiration of other shows ever since. Watch a few episodes and judge for yourself.

I don't wanna be on the guys junk or nothin but this is a really good album.<br />I am very excited about this album.....and I think you can tell.  Anyways this album has hot tracks and production is on point and lyrics are good too.  It all equals out to be the best album of this year maybe even for next year.<br />This guy has been out for a second....and that's the only down point....He should have came from the Underground a long time ago!!!  I haven't listen to a lot of 50's old stuff but I don't think it could compare to this album.<br />This album hands down a must get!!! So stop reading this review and cop that already!!!

B00006RU5B|3.0|I liked Soundgarden, and I loved Rage, but the combo just doesn't work. Cornell's voice simply does not jive with Morello's funk/fx style guitar sound or Rage's hard hitting bass and drums. In addition, the songs that are &quot;soft&quot; mix better, but also end up being somewhat boring. The final verdict: Why won't Zack come back?
B00005A46T|5.0|This is hands down the best heavy metal album I have ever heard in my life! I cannot get over it, I love this band!!!!!
B000002TIQ|5.0|Saxon in my opinion were one of the most underrated metal bands in history and they couldn't break into the big league like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Def Leppard did, vocalist Biff Byford has a unique voice and Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver are in the same competition as Dave Murray and Adrian Smith of Iron Maiden or K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest.<br />Princess of the Night<BR>One of Saxon's best songs and too band that it couldn't be on Collection of Metal. 5/5<br />Never Surrender<BR>Amazing song even though it's only 3:13. 5/5<br />Out of Control<BR>Not as strong as the first two but a good song nevertheless.<BR>4/5<br />Rough and Ready<BR>A little better than the previous song but not quite a classic.<BR>4/5<br />Play it Loud<BR>Great song, and if the people around you think it's too loud, don't listen to them. 5/5<br />And the Bands Played On<BR>Saxon got this song from playing the Monsters of Rock tour in England, another classic. 5/5<br />Midnight Rider<BR>A biker anthem and again another Saxon classic. 5/5<br />Fire in the Sky<BR>A decent song, but not Saxon's best. 4/5<br />Denim and Leather<BR>Now they saved the best for last, the title track is such a killer tune, it should've been a metal anthem like Quiet Riot's Cum on Feel the Noize or Ratt's Round and Round, as a matter of fact, this album is worth it for the title track alone, I'd give this song a 11 if I can. 5/5<br />If you're a classic metal fan, you must get this album but beware, it's very hard to find and it shouldn't be, this album needs more recognition than what it gets.
0201633612|5.0|I was still a fledgling developer at the time I attempted to first read this book. My initial impression was that it was outdated and dry. But as the months and projects went by, I began to understand the importance of patterns in general and this remarkable text in particular. Indeed, without much experience in the field, one might find this book too theoretical, or even irrelevant to practical work. But one day, you'll find yourself faced with a particularly nasty problem, and all of the sudden a pattern will flash in your mind, and click! The connection is made, and the problem is solved. It was very gratifying for me to experience this feeling over and over again; as I'm sure it would be for any junior developer just getting his feet wet.<br />Two words of advice come to mind, though: First, please keep in mind that the patterns herein are not the only ones out there; there are many others documented in various other books and articles. Second, be very careful of the Singleton pattern; it is the most overused and abused of the patterns, simply because it is easy to implement. And note that the text says nothing about the destruction of a Singleton, so watch out.<br />It is my opinion that this book should become mandatory reading for all software developers of all levels, and the patterns within it should be as common a construct as an \\"if\\" statement or a \\"for\\" loop. Please, do yourself and your profession a favor and read this book.
B00004Z459|4.0|I bought this album for In The End, and not sure if I'd like any of the other songs. At first, this band seems like a Limp Bizkit copy. I was far from wrong. The have their fair share of songs that are poor on this record, but when this band shines, they can really shine. In fact, they are on of the greatest rap-rock bands ever.<br />Most of the songs, such as In The End are miracles to the rock world, while some aren't great. However, Linkin Park always finds a way to come through to the audience that' listening. Songs such as Crawling and Runaway, as well as A Place For My Head are wonderful, almsot god-like. These songs are terrific for a freshman effort.<br />There are only minor glitches in the album. For one thing, the rap sequences need to be better performed. They are off-key and can't follow the rhythym AT ALL! They need to just stick with Chester, who is the next great rocker for this country. Also, lack of songs and song length hurt the album. Instead of most songs being only around three minutes, the band needs to find a way to lengthen the songs without destroying them.<br />Overall, if you like rock or In The End, Linkin's first effort is just right for you!
B00006J9OT|5.0|Great songs and great rhythms. Wow!!!
B00004XOWM|3.0|It was very hard to decided whether to hate this album or to love it. I guess I decided on both. Some moments on the album, such as My Way or even Rollin' were great. Some are downright [bad]! Guitar riffs that are hard to follow, drums that hurt the ears, and vocals so bad that it sounds like fred Durst is deathly ill when singing. So, the case is with the album, buy it if you really like Limp Bizkit or are familiar with the songs, otherwise, don't.
B000085RTZ|5.0|_Epica_ is the long awaited sixth album from Kamelot, and their fourth with former Conception vocalist Roy Khan. I believe they are by far the best European-styled power metal band that has ever made music (it's not gratuitous praise!). What makes Kamelot different from the rank pile of horrible power metal bands? For that matter, what makes them *amazing* instead of just good? The answer is very simple: Khan and Thomas Youngblood.<br />Khan's voice soars on eagle's wings, his emotional power, unique timbre, subtle (Norwegian) accent, and perfect inflection make him not only the finest vocalist in this style, but nearly any other as well. Actually, I'm hard pressed to think of a male vocalist I like more than the mighty Khan.<br />If you've read anything about _Epica_ in the hype before its release, one might consider it hopelessly pretentious for some \\"power metal\\" band to write an album based somewhat on J.W. Von Goethe's _Faust_. Hmm... aren't these bands the type that sing about saccharine love stories, saving the environment, and generally trite subjects (with horrid lyrics, no less)? There should be no worries, because Khan -- in addition to being a prime singer -- is an outstanding lyricist, full of evocative colors and depth and beautiful diction. _Epica_, a concept album about a man's search for truth and meaning. Frankly, I think it is brilliantly done. Actually, the story is so interesting that I'm eager to hear Epica Part II even more just to find out what happens. For future reference: Epica > Mindcrime.<br />In \\"The Center of the Universe\\", Ariel questions the meaning of life and longs for truths in which he can support rationally. On \\"Farewell\\" he departs from his home, bidding goodbye to all his loved ones. However, his journey does not go as planned and in \\"The Edge of Paradise\\" he becomes disillusioned and lost, spiraling into an abyss of drug abuse. In his moment of sorrow, he thinks back to his love Helena in \\"Wander\\". But, knowing she is just a memory now, he loses his will to live. Then, in \\"Descent of the Archangel\\", the dark angel Mephisto appears to him and tempts him with vanity. Mephisto brings Ariel to his castle where he satisfies all of his base desires in \\"Feast for the Vain\\". After, Ariel meets with Helena and spends a special moment with her in \\"On the Coldest Winter Night\\". On \\"Lost & Damned\\", Helena goes to tell Ariel of her pregnancy, but he tells her that his search for truth is more important than love. He also fears to be with her after succumbing to Mephisto's temptations. Helena then drowns herself in the river, killing not just herself but her unborn child. Ariel tries to reconcile with this loss in \\"The Mourning After\\", but he is deeply scarred. On \\"III Ways to Epica\\", Ariel -- torn between the evil Mephisto and the angelic Helena -- is left to continue the journey he began at the beginning.<br />The Khan-Youngblood songwriting core is easily the best in this style. As befits an album with such a title, _Epica_ is Kamelot's most epic sounding release to date. The roster of guest musicians rivals that of a Rhapsody album, with the songs weaving soaring symphonic elements into the driving punch of the band's melodic-metal style. Choruses are simply HUGE, melodically sublime and powerful, and the urgent build-up to them via the verses is spine-tingling. Youngblood's thick crunchy guitar sound is toned back a bit, woven through keyboards and strings. Layers of synthesizers throughout many songs recall the atmospheres the band created on \\"The Spell\\" from _Karma_. As always, numerous influences from different eras and regions manifest throughout, but what is especially impressive is how smoothly integrated the diverse elements are. Even in songs with pronounced influences, like the Arabic motif and Gregorian chanting of \\"The Edge of Paradise\\" or the Parisian tango of \\"Lost & Damned\\", everything is fastened together so organically that it took me several listens to notice them. \\"Descent of the Archangel\\" is foreboding and ominous, with eerie menacing verses and a fierce chorus propelled by 16th note double bass drums and machine-gun guitars. Rhapsody's Luca Turilli contributes a frenetic guitar solo in this song.<br />I think few bands execute a ballad with the beauty of Kamelot, and _Epica_'s ballads are no exception. \\"Wander\\" is a summery magenta flush of longing -- sheer perfection. While \\"Wander\\" refers to summer, \\"On the Coldest Winter Night\\" is frostier and darker. A simple plucked guitar figure feels like cold snowflakes on the skin, with a deep double bass adding to the weight of the moment. The djembe adds a sort of earthy warmth to the chill atmosphere, like the heat of the love between Ariel and Helena in that moment the song describes. Co-producer and keyboardist Miro deserves credit here on both these songs especially, his brilliant string arrangements sensually and subtly adding emotion without going over-the-top. One thing Kamelot has over any of their peer bands is subtlety. (Kamelot proves there is nothing inherently cheesy about power metal -- it's a matter of the artist, not the style.)<br />Gorgeous is the fey voice of guest singer Mari, who plays Helena. In \\"Helena's Theme\\", she sings exquisitely with the Rodenburg Symphony Orchestra for the album's prettiest moment. Some of the most chilling parts are where Khan and Mari trade-off lines, as in the piano-based interlude in \\"The Center of the Universe\\" and the epochal chorus of \\"III Ways to Epica\\" (best chorus, like, ever).<br />The limited edition has beautiful packaging and features a bonus track called \\"Snow\\", a speedy cut which would have fit nicely onto _Karma_.<br />This is an amazing release which tops even the amazing _Karma_, which was so good I thought they would never beat it. It's almost scary to think how good this band might still become. _Epica_ is a pure masterpiece that should render a hopeless feeling of impotence upon all other power metal bands.

0671027573|4.0|This is a good story and of course as I've come to expect of Linda Howard, very well written. The pace starts off slow with &quot;the list&quot; and the media attention it garners but then really picks up when the list authors start getting murdered. This is a great story if you can ignore the fact that a list like this would hardly raise an eyebrow let alone get nationwide media attention.

0140187537|3.0|This book is short, but it seems to plod along.  It feels forced, as though Steinbeck was straining to write about normal people when possibly he couldn't relate to them anymore.  The characters are O.K.  But nothing like the characters in the other books I have read by him thus far: Grapes, Eden, Cannery and the Pearl.  Basically I was disappointed.  However, I will still seek out more Steinbeck to read since most of the other works I have mentioned were so monumental.  Every writer is allowed a dud here and there, especially one who has such an amazing track record.
0375703764|5.0|I read House of Leaves almost three years ago.  I was in a creative writing class, and one of the students who was familiar with my work told me about Mark K. Danielewski's book.  I went out and bought the book several days later, and from the first page I was instantly drawn in.  The inner thoughts of the main character was stunning.  I felt at times that he was in my room with me speaking into my ear.  I think the character's name was Johnny.  Like I said, it's been a while since I read the book, but since I've given the book to a friend who I told had to read it, and I've bought it as gifts for two other friends.  And whoa, the story of the Navidsons.  This was incredible.  The idea of the house they lived in holding such horror.  Emptiness, or nothing, perhaps, is the greatest terror of them all, and House of Leaves captures this fear and relates it to the reader so that we, too, share in the nightmare of the characters who explore the house.<br />As great as this book was, I do admit that there were sections throughout the book that I skimmed over or skipped altogether.  Some of the explanation was a little too dull and uninteresting.  Some of the explanations were definitely too long.  But all in all, I think House of Leaves is one of the greatest books ever written, and I'm sure it will make an immortal out of its author, Mark Z. Kanielewski.
B0000797IO|5.0|Well, it has been a week since I watched this film and I am still thinking about it while I try to go to sleep.  Perhaps it has something to do with being transplanted to California from a life in Kentucky that I know would have wound up just like Justine's.  But I know there is more at work here to make this film so thought-provoking.<br />The basic plot, without spoiling anything, is this:  Justine is a young married woman whose husband is a gentle but somewhat slow pothead.  She involves herself with Holden, a co-worker, hoping for a temporary diversion from what she sees as the dead end of her life.  She underestimates Holden's immaturity, however, and her efforts to reverse her initial poor decision cause things to get more and more out of control for her.  Yes, it isn't a terribly action-filled plot, but who of us leads a life that would read like a James Bond film if summarized in five sentences?  And therein lies the genius of this little film: accurately reproducing the little mannerisms and patterns that mark day-to-day life.<br />The script, written by supporting actor Mike White, contains some geniunely comic moments.  The character of Cheryl, Justine's sarcastic co-worker, provides consistent humor, and Zooey Deschanel steals all of her scenes.  However, the poignant and dramatic scenes could easily have come off as cheesy if portrayed by actors any less accomplished than the ones cast.  Jennifer Aniston gained my complete respect with this performance, which is leagues away from anything she has done in comedies or for TV.  She portrays Justine's quiet desperation with finesse and expressiveness.  Jake Gyllenhaal, reprising the &quot;disturbed young man&quot; role he did so well in &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, manages to express a range of emotions with very little shift in facial expression, showing a mastery of his art that is positively precocious at his age.  At this point the only problem Gyllenhaal has is that he is so good in this role that he risks being typecast.  The supporting cast is great as well:  John C. Reilly offers yet another dead-on portrayal of a cuckolded husband, Tim Blake Nelson is the perfect typical stoner with darker desires percolating in his subconscious, and Mike White has written himself into the film perfectly as the religious-zealot security guard.<br />This is not an easy film to watch.  Its themes are troubling, its ending does not neatly wrap up everyone's stories, and the characters we are supposed to root for sometimes make decisions that are extremely hard to justify.  But the film does a great job at getting behind the decisions people make that sometimes seem incomprehensible to others.  In short, this is a film you should see if you don't mind that it may not leave your thoughts for several days.  It manages to amuse at times, but ultimately leaves you with questions of &quot;Why did that happen?&quot; and &quot;What did that mean?&quot;.  Kind of like life itself.s being typecast.

B00006G8G1|5.0|This is a great DVD!!! great songs in special of New Brave World album. The sound and video quality is really good. Maybe the edition of scenes is too fast and Adrain's solos needed more camera attention. But the real important thing is that Iron Maiden is more live than ever. They just love the music, what a 3 guitars, steve\\"simply great\\", Nicko is the heart's band and Bruce is the best heavy metal singer ever. Without Bruce IM is not the real IM. Great songs and also the second disc(interwies,etc) is very cool. Buy this DVD. Up the Irons.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It is definitely true that memory cards cost too much for how much data they can hold, but there is nothing we can do about that.  Therefore, we are left with a few memory cards cheaper than this one, but I want to tell you that the trouble they cause is not worth the money you save.  Most other memory cards require you to boot the PS2 up with a particular CD that will make the mem card work.  However, this Sony card does not require that at all and is therefore the best purchase for your money.<br />I have heard some of my friends saying they want to wait on the PS2 hard drive to come out so they will not have to get a memory card but this is a frivalous hope.  The hard drive is out in Japan and it still requires a memory card to use it, and it requires that it be this specific memory card.<br />If your looking for a memory card, there is no better choice than this one.<br />Pros:<BR>No boot CD required<BR>Can hold data for about 5-15 games depending on file size<BR>Fits in game carrying cases<br />Fastest memory card on the market<br />Con:<BR>Most expensive card out there, but definitely worth the price
B00004TH7Z|5.0|As simple as that, heavy metal is back with its best band, IRON MAIDEN. Brave New World is  really one of their greatest album. The most important thing is that Bruce and Adrian are part of the band again. Bruce is fantastic, his voice is intact. Adrians guitar is perfect as always and also great with lyrics like THE WICKER MAN ( for me the best NBW song). Dave,Steve,Janick and Nicko(cool and power) are terrific. All songs are really good;Ghosts, Brave New World,Blood Brothers, dreams, etc. I loved the lyrics of all songs cause every member in the group has participed. Buy this cd. And If you want feel the power of MAIDEN, watch RIO DVD.
B000000JO3|5.0|Minor Threat is the only band in rock and popular music history with an intelligent and really important message (neither pseudo leftist activism nor childish messianic attitude). The message: TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. This is supossed to be a really punch for all hedonist and empty morality of rock music. Minor Threat music? Harmfull and lethal. As the music should be.

All the 8 songs are great, the lyrics are awesome( specially SEA OF MADNESS ) and the music is perfect, fast and powerful.Hear the music in CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, The voice and chorus in HEAVEN CAN WAIT, The melody in  DEJA VU. This is an album you listen complete over and over. And IM did it after a tour and an album like LIVE AFTER DEATH, a masterpiece.<BR>Buy this cd it is also a Masterpiece.

B00005JLRR|3.0|I finally dragged my boyfriend to see Nemesis at a local bargain theater, and although I cannot say that I totally hate it, neither can I endorse it wholeheartedly.  The special effects were good and the acting was fair considering what the actors had to work with, but as a Star Trek film it was disappointgly mediocre.  For one thing, certain scenes prompted some rather ribald comments on the part of both my boyfriend and I, and the rest of the audience (all 6 of 'em) didn't give a rip, or at least they didn't have us tossed out.  That, to me, says that while they might not have totally agreed with our assessment of the film, neither did they disagree.<br />All in all, I have to say that I agree with one of our local talk-radio reviewers: if Nemesis had been totally unconnected with Star Trek it would have been a wonderful film, but as a Star Trek film, it was a dud.

Time Out of Mind is the album that could have been if Bob Dylan would have been the major contributor in its production. Having said this, the talent of Bob Dylan comes through in spite of the hypnotic weavings of Mr. Lanois and &quot;Trying To Get To Heaven&quot; is one of the best train song analogies both lyricly and musically I have ever heard. Bob Dylan is a well traveled man, both personally and artistically. His voice and experience are part of the American landscape and that is what makes his singing so rich, seasoned, pure, truthful, and more, and more, and more... What an awesome album this could have been, only to have been followed by &quot;Love and Theft.&quot; Remarkable!
B00004X0ER|3.0|I dont really see what the big deal is about this disc, theres a few good songs but nothing on it really blows me away. Its nothing new either, the singer and the songs sound distinctly similar to two other swedish bands, Refused and the INC (who are both amazing). ANYway, i wouldnt recommend this cd...but its not terrible either, its just kinda...there. if you want to hear something similar sounding definitley check out Refused : the shape of punk to come...or the INC
B000084T18|4.0|Dr. Dre and Eminem have done it again!  Thus proving them the King Midas' of the Urban music scene. The debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin', from Dr. Dre/Eminem protg 50 Cent has created a huge buzz throughout the scene in the last weeks leading up to its release, and they delivered in top form.  50 has proven that he is not just hot today, but will be at the top for awhile to come.  50 Cent's unique style is a welcomed change from the general formula that has been the  scene.  This album is  off the hook.  Tracks like  In Da Club, What Up Gangsta and Patiently Waiting (with  Eminem), my personal fave, you shouldn't think twice about snagging this.  Looks like 50's plan to \\"put the rap game in a choke hold\\" is going just as he planned it.
B00006SFBD|5.0|If you can name another band that's making metal as powerful, vital, multitextured, emotionally vibrant or just plain important as Opeth, i'd like to hear the nominees.  This record smokes from beginning to end, pausing briefly in the middle to bear down the flames for a much needed repast and simmer, but overall showcasing some of the most tight and amazing movements of their career.  Openers &quot;Wreath&quot; and the titular &quot;Deliverance&quot; come out of the gate screaming; the latter starts out like Emporer, streaks through a forest full of Porcupine Trees and ends up kicking Meshuggah in the face.  (Drummers, remember this name : MARTIN LOPEZ.  He's priming to give current cause celebre Portnoy a good shakedown. ) &quot;A Fair Judgement&quot;, perhaps the most ambitious and rewarding track, is notable for its gentle, swinging 6/4 floydian-shuffle, slow build, genuinely riveting Mikael Akerfeldt solos and its epic closing riffs, which evoke the glorious, doomy days of Candlemass.  The album closes with the jagged, complex puzzle &quot;By The Pain I See In Others&quot;, which shows the most imaginative production on the album - especially the raspy, electronically-treated growl of Akerfeldt.  What's most impressive about this band is how they grow with even more careful refinement in their craft with their multilayered, prog-influenced songwriting, even if the songs are largely not a departure from _Still Life_ or _Blackwater Park_.  The transitions are even more seamless than before and the production is even tighter.  Best of all, having survived my first Opeth show on this tour, I can say that this band is razor-sharp and perfectly capable of devastating any listener with its most ambitious material live.  With this only being the first (and darker) chapter of a planned two-CD release (the second of which, _Damnation_, is promised later this year), this album (and band) is a thrill ride that no self-proclaimed metal fan has any conceivable excuse to miss.
B000088E77|5.0|I'm a hard-core Men at Work fan.  I grew up in the 80s and saw the new version of the group twice in concert.  This is a good pick-up.  Digitally remastered...sounds great!  You will hear the difference!...especially in the drumming on 'Down Under.'  'Crazy' is a great bonus track...a very fun song.  'F-19' is an instrumental.  The other 'bonus tracks' were previously released on the 'Brazil' concert cd.  The liner notes add a lot to this cd.
0800141660|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is a very good movie with wonderful acting from each member of the cast.  Particularly noteworthy is Emma Thompson as Elinor Dashwood, because she not only stars in the film but also wrote the screenplay! Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman are also great in their roles as Marianne, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon - and as a fan of \\"All Creatures Great & Small,\\" I can't leave out Robert Hardy, who plays Mrs. Dashwood's (Gemma Jones) jovial cousin, Sir John Middleton.<br />If you've already seen this film and enjoyed it, you might want to check out a book, written by Emma Thompson, entitled \\"The Sense & Sensibility Screenplay And Diaries\\".  It contains the entire shooting script as well as Thompson's account of what making the movie was like, and it's just as awesome as the film itself.
0385312083|3.0|A symbolic meat locker kept Kurt Vonnegut alive during the fire bombing of Dresden in WWII, however, it seemed to kill his imaginative character Billy Pilgrim who he met there.  The war left the protagonist, Billy, as a shell shocked victom whose imagination will take the reader on a joy ride through time and space.  He displays many symptoms of an individual with mental issues, but the realistic interpretations of his time traveling and the adoption of new alienistic beliefs leave the reader with constant questions regarding his mental state.  \\"Possibly, he may not be insane, maybe he is absolutely correct\\", are some of the things you may ask yourself when reading Kurt Vonneguts interesting novel.  This book has facts throughout but, most of the book is Sci-fi and wierdly interpreted.  Its a great book to just sit back and let your mind be open too....
0393317552|5.0|Where I'd have to disagree with Mr. Meiner above is that Diamond isn't actually referring so much to the suitability of an area for agriculture; what's he's referring to is the suitability of crops and animals for domestication to agriculture, a matter of genetic diversity, really.  Instead of approaching anthropology as an anthropologist, he approaches it as an evolutionary behaviorist.  What's around you?  How would it influence what actions are available to you?<br />Diamond attempts in this book to draw a correlation between the plants available to natural population of humans and the likelihood of that population developing an agricultural civilization.  Observing the plant life either natively available to a region or available by east-west transfer (as those plants would be mostly likely to succeed in the transplanted area), Diamond assessed the energy profit in calories of farming those plants versus hunting and gathering and then tried to link that to which strategy succeeded in that area.<br />He also assays the animals that were available for domestication and tries to assay them not only as food but as trainable tools.  By assessing the inherent 'domesticability' of the animals around a culture, he again tries to relate that to their likelihood of developing some sort of ranching or animal husbandry versus relying on wild animals as prey.<br />Unlike most Homo sapiens, biologists aren't so used to separating humans categorically from the rest of the residents of the earth and are used to thinking of organismal behavior in terms of caloric profit - what maximizes my available energy and nutrients?  How do I go about it?  So, while this might seem like an off-the-wall nutjob approach to a problem to a historian, say, to a biologist it reads like a tried-and-true method.<br />The only assumption he makes that I would maybe question is the notion that all higher civilization then ensues from the development of an agricultural society.  Being a scientist froman industrial society myself, I am inclined to agree that technology is a good rough indicator of the \\"height\\" of a civilization.  My friend the poet or the philosopher might be less inclined to agree.  That's a question of criteria, though, not a critique of the whole approach.<br />As far as his standard goes, I think he makes a pretty good case.  He draws on several direct examples and cases as well, largely from the southern Pacific and Australian regions, to illustrate his point.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it's hard to be perfect when you're the only one doing something.  I think that even if you don't think you're going to agree with this book, it's worth reading, if only because of its freshness.
B000089CKH|2.0|I generally don't take the time to write reviews, but I felt I had to come to the aid of the poor, defenseless critic from Minneapolis (see their accurate, if lengthy, review of the enhanced cd version.)  A courageous move, considering that I, too, may one day have my self esteem irreparably damaged by another one of you who takes a difference of opinion (about something as trivial as a cd, no less) as a personal affront, when I find my self castigated for being a \\"loser\\" who is \\"hell-bent on destroying\\" something.  And yes, he/she did just cut and paste the review from pitchforkmedia.com (the greatest music review source around.)  But as Picasso said, \\"A good artist borrows.  A great artist steals.\\"  (Can't wait to hear a \\"what does that Picasso guy know about art, anyway?\\" in a forthcoming `Nada Surf for President & cabinet' review.)<br />Anyway, on to the music.  After hearing the insipid \\"Inside of Love\\" on one of our local Clear-Channel owned \\"alternative\\" radio stations, I was fairly confident I could avoid the album without missing much.  For those of you who haven't heard the song in its entirety, just keep your televisions tuned to the WB, as it is destined to turn up on Dawson's Creek, or whatever the new-teen-melodrama-of-the-moment happens to be.  <br />But to my (mild) suprise, as I was reading the latest issue of GQ, I found it listed in their \\"what's in our cd player this month\\" column, which piqued my curiosity and prompted me to check it out the next time I was in my local cd store. <br />Thank God I was able to hear the whole thing at a listening station before buying it.  The common-sense notion that 40-something white-collar guys are usually not a source to consult when searching for hip, new music had been re-affirmed.  To sum it up in one sentence, the album is full of a lot of catchy, if unoriginal and easily forgotten, melodies, blemished by banal and sophomoric lyrics (\\"I wanna know what it's liiiiiiiiiike, on the iiiiiiiiiinside of loooove.\\") Put this one next to Jimmy Eat World on your cd shelf.  Although, I must confess I don't speak French, so maybe La Pour Ca is the song where Matthew Caws shows off his lyrical mastery. <br />And to the retort \\"But they're HUGE in Europe,\\" may I point out that so are Destiny's Child (as Mr. Minneapolis/pitchfork guy noted,) J.LO, `NSync, and Creed.  There is a huge difference between writing a good song, and writing one that is popular for a few weeks with the hottest-new-fad-purveying, TRL and Real World-obsessed masses that plague our country (or whatever country they happen to reside in.)<br />So instead of buying \\"Let Go\\" I did my good deed for the day and purchased a copy of Interpol's \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\" for a friend.  Their debut album contains lyrics like \\"I'll surprise you sometimes / I'll come around / When you're down\\" and \\"I had seven faces / Thought I knew which one to wear / I'm sick of spending these lonely nights / Training myself not to care.  The subway is a porno / The pavements, they are a mess / I know you've supported me for a long time / Somehow, I'm not impressed.\\" Now that's good songwriting.
B000002LIX|4.0|This is a great album, after listening you'll know where a lot of today's artists got their sound. It paved the way for almost all modern rock of the nineties and I doubt it'll stop influencing artists in this millenium.

B00007E8V4|5.0|This is my second review for this CD. I have decided to rewrite it because now I am more understanding of this album and I have my new alias. These songs are far from \\"B-sides\\" as many like to call it and could have had made it to Toxicity. The songs are all mostly good with the exception of a few(36 and Pictures). Here is my review of the songs:<BR>Chic 'N' Stu-Pretty funny song. I usually skip it though when the CD is playing. 4 stars.<BR>Innervisions-Really awsome song. Normal SOAD. I think it's the first single but that's just word of mouth. Great drumming in the begining. 5 stars.<BR>Bubbles-This song is really fast paced and could be compared to Science or Shimmy from Toxicity. Great guitar work! 5 stars.<BR>Boom!-Really political like P.L.U.C.K. or Prision Song from the previous two albums. Starts of with Serj just talking in like a kind of chant-like speech then it blasts into the normal song. 5 stars.<BR>Nuguns-This song is very catchy but not the best on the album. 4 stars.<br />A.D.D.-Insightful lyrics about war. Really cool chorus. 5 stars.<BR>Mr.Jack-Slowest song on the album(like Spiders and Aerials)but at the end it gets really fast and heavy. I really like the very last words they say! 5 stars.<BR>I-E-A-I-A-I-O-This song is my fvaorite on the whole CD! The chrous is great. Kind of like a religious chant. 5 stars.<BR>36-46 seconds of okay music. 3 stars.<BR>Pictures-Just runs together with 36. 3 stars.<BR>Highway Song-My second favorite song. Great chrous as well. Awsome drumming in the begining. 5 stars.<BR>!@#* the System-Funny. Not really any lyrics besides the title. 5 stars.<BR>EgoBrains-Starts out acoustic. Interesting lyrics but not the best. 4 stars<BR>Thetawaves-Third favorite. \\"All rise\\". 5 stars.<BR>Roulette-Awsome acoustic song. Tied with IEAIAIO for my favorite song. Awsome lyrics to go along with cool music. 5 stars.<BR>Steamline-Not much to say about this song. 4 stars.<BR>This CD will be good for any fan of SOAD. Do not buy this if youare just getting into SOAD. I would suggest first getting Toxicity then the self-titled debut then this. THis CD has it's low pionts but is still very good!

0375414053|5.0|Kate Reddy is a working mom who is trying very, very hard to balance her job at a conservative, male-dominated company and her role as mother to two small children. When we first meet Kate, she is \\"distressing\\" a store-bought mince pie to make it look homemade. Why?  Well, her daughter's school is having a bake sale the next day.  She's been out of the country on business and has no time to bake.  But she refuses to be the kind of mother who brings a store-bought pie to a bake sale.<br />Kate's not perfect.  There are times when her relationship with her husband and children is not something she can be proud of.  But the author lets us get to know Kate well enough so that we can understand why she tries as hard as she does to create the life she wants for her family.<br />I loved this book, and I loved Kate.  Would strongly recommend!
B0000072VM|3.0|This is not that memorable of a recording, as the style tends to leave a lot of dead space between passages.  It's as if the band did not have the technical ability to sustain what they were playing for too long.  On top of this, the melodies stick too much to the scales, so it's not very inventive.  Fans say it's a &quot;pretty&quot; album and I think it's fair to say that it somewhat accomplishes that in the production side of things, but again the melodies are not very interesting at all.  I don't agree that this is the masterpiece that everyone thinks it is.  But I got another PFM record that is better--Chocolate Kings.  Although they sing in English in that one and sound kind of stupid, it rocks!  It sounds like a different group to me.
B00006RIO7|5.0|As a huge fan of the stage production, I was expecting a disaster with the film and soundtrack, but I was very happy to be wrong.  Not only did director Rob Marshall stylize the numbers into fantasy sequences, he blends them in seeminglessly.  The best effect was the drip, guard step and fingernail tap on the cellbars to lead into 'Cellblock Tango'.  The puppet show visualization in 'We Both Reached for the Gun' was the best choreographed/effect laden scene that I have seen in recent memory.  All songs were on par with the 1995 stage revival except for John C. Reilly's brilliant agonizing rendition of 'Mr. Cellophane', which was superior.  <br />The only disappointment I found was the absence of the bitterly humorous Velma Kelly number, 'I Know a Girl' which would have taken place between the time Roxie says that she's pregnant and the doctor &quot;verifying&quot; it.  Other than that it is a brilliant film and soundtrack.
B0000071J0|4.0|There is a passage towards the end of the first piece where the band is doing an impromptu jam and the Moog is going off with these trippy sounds with the drums keeping a marching beat.  Everytime I hear this part I feel like I'm about to have an out of body exprience--it's that good!  <br />Le Orme is like ELP but is not bombastic and less technical.  But they make up for it by having a unique style of their own, whereas with ELP you never get the feeling that they really have a style, but rather a bundle of different styles.  Because of this I think some like Le Orme better.  And the moods of the typical Le Orme recording is quite melancholic(is that a word?), giving a more sophisticated feel.  <br />I laugh when other fans call works like this dated...as if it's something bad.  I mean just listen to a TOOL album next year and tell me it's not the lamest thing you've ever heard.  Then listen to it in 30 years--you won't stop laughing.  Le Orme on the other hand has aged very well, they've done nothing they to be ashamed of, compared to what some of the things ELP or Banco have done.

B00006CYAD|4.0|I've been listening to these guys for a while now, it's nice to see them finally make it on to MTV, even though I despise the station considering they don't play music much anymore.  The song I'D DO ANYTHING is an amazing song and after I downloaded it from MP3.com I couldn't stop listening to it and had to get the rest of the album.  All of the songs are quite catchy, fun to listen to, and have a good change of taking over your CD player for at least a month.  If you like punk I'd highly suggest this, if you don't find a friend who has it and check it out because this is a CD that you really don't want to miss.
0679735259|5.0|Pure poetry so vivid I covet the author's nightmares. <br />The war's chronology and events remain jumbled but I am left with an indelible impression - of futility, waste, confusion, paranoia, youth and the strongest camaraderie all at once.

B000055XMF|1.0|The film is such a gritty &amp; powerful snapshot of life in early 60's England, set to the stirring music of The Who, that it is hard not to get swept up in the whole atmosphere of it, however, the remastering to DVD leaves alot to be desired, &amp; the fact that several important scenes have been left out of the film with no reason or explanation, not even a &quot;deleted scenes&quot; feature on the menu, makes the DVD release hard to enjoy &amp; some aspects of the story difficult to get for the first time viewer.<BR> I would say try &amp; track down a copy of the 80's VHS version, the audio might not be as good, but you get all the scenes &amp; to be honest, the picture quality is no different.<BR> Sorry, but the DVD just isn't worth it....
078061755X|4.0|Shine tells the true story of child genius pianist David Helfgott who suffers physical and mental abuse through his overbearing father (Armin Mueller Stahl) until he finally manages to escape to university in London.  However, his childhood still bearing over him along with the pressures of having to do well force his eccentricities to breaking point until he suffers a mental breakdown after performing Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3 in D Minor.  Spending his early adult years in an institution it isn't until he meets Lynn Redgrave, an astrologist, and starts up playing the piano at a local bar that David realises his true potential.<br />For years now the true life saga has been marred by criticism for being inaccurate or overly sensationalist.  Witness the good but ultimately incredibly flawed (despite superb performances) Beautiful Mind from a couple of years ago.  Play around with the material and you will only garner mixed reviews.  Even movies about madness seem to have a certain stigma attached to them simply due to the fact that many seem tailored towards the star.  Neither of these is the case with Shine, an understated and therefore touching and genuine movie from Australia.  Whilst the main theme of overcoming all obstacles to realise the person that you can be may sound clichéd, it is here done incredibly well by all concerned.  It's slow-burning, which might put a few people off, but the emotional pay-off is intense and even though this won't make you cry (something that appears to be almost requisite for a genre that often suffocates in sentimentality) it's certainly intelligent and makes you think.<br />A lot of what makes Shine such an impressive view of madness os down to some superb performances from Noah Taylor (Flirting) and Geoffrey Rush (Lantana) as the teenage and adult David respectively.  The character progression is among the best I've seen in the last few years on film, ensuring constantly that madness is never reduced to a mere stereotype.Rush's performance was deservedly Oscar-winning, although Taylor is every bit as good as you watch David's eccentricities gradually become more and more detatched from reality.  The fact that the filmmakers can then mould this into a sympathetic character that is starting to overcome his own insanity is very good indeed.  Also worthy of mention is Lynn Redgrave as David's future wife, who puts in an understated performance to go with a decidedly understated movie that is all the better for it.  If you liked this I'd highly recommend Hilary and Jackie, which tells the story of British cellist Jacqueline du Pré in a similarly sympathetic but realist fashion.
0393307050|5.0|Now that the film of MASTER AND COMMANDER is about to be released, starring Russell Crowe, many new readers will be attracted to this, the first of the Aubrey-Maturin series<br />that launched the 20-book series and consumed the last 30+ years of the author's life. This series established O'Brian as one of the outstanding writers of the 20th century.<br />Modern readers must attempt a deliberate intellectual change of pace and perspective to acquire empathy with this book and its successors. O'Brian captures with exceptional ability the language, style and pacing of almost two centuries ago, yet such is his skill that within a short time the reader is carried away by his mastery of the subject, clearly based on immersion in the historical record, coupled in O'Brian's case to extraordinary skills of observation and literary execution.<br />O'Brian works in ways that are significantly different from, even alien to, many modern writers. He takes the time to establish time, place, character and plot, capturing at the same time a master's sense of perspective that is remarkably broad and highly informative in every area he touches, from music to the technologies of sailing and warfare in the era.<br />Reading M&amp;C will almost certainly launch the new reader on a long and enjoyable journey through the succeeding books of the series, into a period that profoundly affects the world today. It will be time well spent, and will enrich the reader in ways that extend from natural philosophy to world affairs, capturing a time in history when individual character and courage counted.<br />For a further examination of O'Brian's skills, may I respectfully refer the reader of this review to my review of his novel TESTIMONIES, re-issued by Norton in 1993.

B000063DIF|5.0|I remember when this album first came out. I had just become a huge Maiden fan after the previous record Somewhere In Time. By this time, I had bought their back catalogue of studio albums and<BR>was swept up by the hype surrounding the release of Seventh Son. I remember Bruce Dickinson being interviewed on MTV's Headbanger's Ball and stating this album would be \\"quite popular to people who have never seen this band before\\" because it was the best album they had made to date and it was going to take Maiden in new, exciting directions. Then I saw the video for \\"Can I Play With Madness,\\" and that whetted my appetite even more (O.K., many fans at the time thought the song was too commercial, but it is still awesome and one of their best singles ever!). I recall bugging the record store clerks many times with \\"Have you got the new Iron Maiden album in yet?\\" I don't think I have ever been so excited about an album release before or since! When I finally bought it (I wanted it on cassette, but the store was out so I opted for yes, you guessed it, VINYL because I couldn't wait), I think I was slightly disappointed at first. <br />My expectations were a bit too high. But the more I played it, the more I liked it. When I listen to it now, after all this time, I can really appreciate the genius of it. A true conceptual album about a child born with clairvoyant powers (the seventh son of a seventh son), who did not want to be born this way and has problems dealing with the strange circumstances he finds himself in as well as the forces of good and evil battling for his soul. The music is brilliant, with accoustical guitar, keyboards and other additions to transform Maiden's sound. In retrospect, Seventh Son was the last great Maiden album. Instead of being a stepping stone to more Maiden innovations, it proved to be Maiden's peak. Things seemed to go down hill after this record, with Adrian Smith and, later, Dickinson leaving to work on their own projects.  I still only have this album on vinyl.  My record has an Eddie illustration on the round sticker of one of the sides and the song list on the other side (a little annoying when looking for a track).  The inner sleeve has lyrics and a small photo of the band on one side and a full page illustration of Eddie at a desk writing in book with a sphere in front showing the significance of his birth.  The back cover of the album has an ice scene with Eddie figures as icebergs.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I saw the first Harry Potter and absolutely love it.  I also read the books.  The Chamber of Secret was very good and better than the first one.  Dobby was great.  He looked very real.  It did not look like it was computer generated.  The special effect in the movie has certain improve from the first movie.  I love the scene when Ron got the \\"Howler\\" letter from his mom.  It was very funny.  The movie was kept very close to the book this time.  <br />I definiately recommmend this DVD.  If you are a Harry Potter fan, you got to get the DVD and watch it again.  If you are not, you should go watch.  It is indeed a great film for all ages.
0316666343|4.0|A friend recommended &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; to me. As a mother of a 14 year old girl, I didn't think I'd be able to get through this book. The opening really grabs you and I felt I was with Susie in that hole. Through the first 100 pages I put the book down several times emotionally drained.  Unable to leave it I read the book in one night.  I liked that Heaven appeared to be what she needed. I felt Susie's lack of anger at her killer was comforting. What physical things we have or endure in this life aren't near as important as the relationships we embrace.
B00004Z400|5.0|This is one of the best aggro-rock CDs I own. It has some of the best variety, I have heard in a CD ever. I mean they go from hard to soft to harder and then softer, the sound varies from song to song, and they never did that before, but Deftones has accomplished the impossible. They have climbed to the top of the ladder with \\"White Pony\\". \\"Adrenaline\\" was their beginning on the ladder then with \\"Around The Fur\\" got them higher and this album took them all the way. Another thing that makes this album work is the way Chino makes his vocals go up and down from scream to whisper and still makes it through the album unchanged. I may be speaking in ebonics to some people but that's how much the album means to me. All the other aggro bands like KoRn and others, with the exception of Rage and Se7endust, haven't climbed the ladder. Those other bands haven't tried changing their sound. You need to change your sound to stay with the times. Deftones have done that. Check this CD out immediately.
0440237688|4.0|Reading the book was quite interesting because the reader experiences a world completely different compared to our world. It`s a world without love, feelings, feelings of pain and war, climate, without making own decisions and that`s why this book is so interesting! The story deals with Jonas who is at the age of 12 and who has the most honored job in the community called \\"Receiver\\", which means that he receives the memories of the past of the community, which are given to him by the \\"Giver\\".<BR>On account to the hardness of his announcement, he escapes from the community to search \\"Elsewhere\\"...in the end he arrives there!<BR>I want to recomment this book to everyone.
B0000648WZ|3.0|Well, if you're looking for an actionpacked gung-ho special effects extraveganza, this is a movie for you. The effects are great and when it comes to action this kicks arse! I just hope you don't care for crummy acting, (I'm sorry but Casper is just silly I think)<BR>                       BUT......<BR>If you like the book, do NOT watch this movie! It is a horrible disgrace to it. The only thing kept basicly was the title, the character names and the bugs. Everything else is made up the director's head. Although I don't really care, the gore is very nasty, the dialogue is poor and it incorporates pointless nudity which wasn't needed at all.<BR>                       BUT......<BR>If you're like me and is just a StarCraft fan, you'll think this is cool because it's a lot like the Terran against the Zerg.
B000088E6M|5.0|When I read in the source about how Eminem had signed 50 cent to his new Shady/Aftermath label, I had to be honest, I had never heard of him. I am a GIANT rap fan, and had never heard of the guy. As I read more, it seemed that he had been shot 9 times. Thats CRAZY I thought. Anyway, fastforward to now. When I heard the single \\"wangksta\\" for the first time, I wasnt feelin the laid back style to much. But as I listened to it more, I heard what the cat was sayin and I was blown away. \\"We ride around with ***** the size of little bow wow\\" that was the first lyric that caught my attention. Instantly I was hooked. As time went on he released \\"In da club\\" and I was blown away. The beat (of course via Dr. Dre) was perfect and the rymes were some of craziest rymes I had ever heard \\"If the roof on fire man......just let it burn, if you talkin about money homie and I ain't concerned\\"- thats just talent. Well now the CD is here and it Defiently lives up to expectations. Here is a run down:<br />1. intro- poor excuse for an extra track, but its just an intro. N/A.<br />2. \\"What up Gangsta\\"- Great lyrics and catchy hook. VERY good starting song. 9/10<br />3. \\"Patiently Waiting\\"- Eminem acually does a great job at production. And very good lyrics by both except for 50 cent's last verses. \\"how I turn the money over, you should call me flippa\\" thats a little weak, but overall one of the best on the CD. 9/10<br />4. \\"Many men\\"- Some of 50's best rymes are spit on this great track. One that really stands out to me is \\"Death gotta be easy, cause life is hard\\". Genius. The only thing holding it back is the tiresome chorus. 9.5/10<br />5. \\"In da club\\"- Very different from the clean version but to good degree. VERY catchy and perfect beat. Only thing I dont like about the song is it seems very short. 9.5/10<br />6. \\"High all the time\\"- Classic song. Simply put. Incredible beat flow and awsome lyrics. Every lyric is genius. One of the best on the CD. 10/10<br />7. \\"Heat\\"- Awsome beat (Dr.Dre) and great lyrics. 50 cent really starts to show his real Gangsta side. Very Awsome. Another classic on the CD. 10/10<br />8. \\"If I cant\\"- The best song on the CD. Classic, in everyway, from the extremly good beat flow, to the mind blowing lyrics. 10/10<br />9. \\"Blood Hound\\"- INCREDIBLE, all that I can say about this song. Classic, from the incredibly catchy chorus, to the perfect lyrics. Young Buck makes an appearence, to good degree. The second best on the CD. 10/10<br />10. \\"Back Down\\"- Wow. Once again Dre makes produces the track and makes it perfect. Filled with disses to Ja Rule and Irv Gotti \\"Jay put on X and made ya hot, now you run around like you a big shot\\", and filled with deep Hip-Hop humor parody's. Its a great and very funny song, one of the best on the CD. 10/10<br />11. \\"P.I.M.P\\"- This is kinda where the classic tracks kinda go away. But this song is still very catchy and good. The only thing wrong with the song is its the same old same old gangsta meeting a girl and you know the rest. Still good though. 8.5/10<br />12. \\"like my style\\"- I'm not really feelin this song. It can get repetative and boring. Still, as always, the song shows 50's lyrical talent. 6.5/10<br />13. \\"Poor lil rich\\"- yeeeeah, this is the kinda tracks we want again. Awsome beat and lyrics are great. Classic. 10/10<br />14. \\"21 Questions\\"- Wow, as gangsta as 50 is, this is an actual love type song. But he doesn't keep too serious (thank God) \\"I love you like a fat boy loves cake\\". Big props to Nate for the hook. 9.5/10<br />15. \\"Dont push me\\"- An alright job by Eminem with the production. But I dont feel it as much as some of the other songs. Its still catchy and good though. 8.5/10<br />16. \\"Gotta Make It To Heavon\\"- Hopefully 50 will go to heavon for some of the best lyrics heard on the alblum. Very good job at making this a real outro to the real tracks.<br />17. *\\"Wanksta\\"- We have all heard this song before. While it was good a while ago, its not nearly the best song on the CD. Still very good though. 9/10<br />18.*\\"U not like me\\"- Bonus track that has already been released a long time ago. Very good though. 9/10<br />19. *\\"Life's on the line\\"- While it is a Bonus track, its an incredible song. Its been released before though. Some of the best lyrics on the album.<br />    So as you can see, its a classic. And until we see some magic happen this year, this will probley be the best CD of the year. We will just have to see how Gangstarr and Dre's new releases do as they will be released later this year. Buy this album, its a classic. The DVD is worth watching too as it is over an hour long of him talking about beefs and where he grew up. It also shows the video's for \\"Wanksta\\"(why edited though?) and \\"Heat\\" which, by watching, was probley not released because of its violent content. I repeat, by this CD.<br />*-Bonus track
0553573403|5.0|This has got to be one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read, and certainly the best I've read lately.  On par with (perhaps even superior to) the Darkover series by Marion Zimmer Bradley, A Game of Thrones is set in a world built 360 degrees out from whatever you're reading on the page.  The writing skills of George R. R. Martin are superlative:  even his minor characters are distinct.  And his plotting skill is more than impressive, making this book a thrilling page turner as well as a satisfying fantasy read.<br />The one complaint I have is that even after 800 pages it ended too soon.  You know how once in a decade you read something that puts you in a world that you don't want to leave?  Well, this is that once in a decade read.  I can't wait to get to the rest of this series!
6305511055|5.0|This is a very enjoyable film. I think it might even be considered a classic.
1573301051|4.0|I saw this special VH1 and I have to say, Celine is the best!  Mariah Carey is great too and so is Shania, to each their own style.  Obviously, Celine - for far the best- and Mariah -used to be better with her older material - have the most incredible singing voices in this much needed music industry.<BR>I have to say, buy this CD for Celine and Mariah, the others are compliment them and make for a good show.
1558908374|5.0|There are few times when an original story is remade and it comes out better. This film is one of them. I loved this film. It was brilliantly done and I applaud Disney for making it.
B00005A46T|1.0|I remember a few years back I heard of this new freaky band called Slipknot with the song Wait and Bleed.I thought it was pretty good,so I bought their self-titled debut.I should have known better,because the album was horrible.Then I heard the single for their second album Iowa called Left Behind.I thought it was just awesome,so I gave these guys one more chance.Once again,I should have known better.This band is not talented,the only talent they have is the same talent Limp Bizkit has,which means,Slipknot has no talent.HAHA.Every song is nothing more than horrible corporate mall metal.Skip this band PLEASE!!!
0375414053|5.0|I truly loved this book. I hated to put it down. I think any woman juggling job and family can indeed relate to Kate. Her observations are hilarious, especially concerning the office personnel. This is the type of book that you can laugh at loud as well as sympathize with Kate and her family. You are able to picture Roo, Kate's mom, and Emma's bouncy castle. Don't miss it!

0590353403|5.0|Harry has been orphaned as a baby and brought up by his Aunt and Uncle, the Dursleys, who have a son of their own around Harry's age. It is not a happy childhood for Harry, always in the shadow of his oversized bullying cousin, he sleeps in the cupboard under the stairs, wears worn out, second hand clothes, which are too big and never receives any love or treats from his Aunt and Uncle, Harry is led to believe his parents were killed in a car crash and he survived. Odd things happen to Harry without explanation, like the day his Aunt and Uncle took Harry to the zoo, a birthday treat for his cousin, and Harry discovered he could talk to a snake. <br />It is approaching Harry's eleven birthday and a letter arrives for him, Harry has never had a letter before, his Uncle is furious and will not allow Harry to read the letter, letter upon letter arrives and they are kept from Harry and the family go into hiding to avoid more letters, eventually on Harry's eleven birthday an enormous man called Hagrid turns up and tells Harry he has been offered a place at a boarding school, he is not an ordinary boy and the school is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hagrid is the gamekeeper at the school, a wizard who was expelled from school in his third year. <br />Harry is told his parents were a wizard and witch, that they were murdered by Voldermort, the dark lord who is so terrifying all but one or two wizards are frightened to even say his name, and that when Voldermort tried to murder Harry something happened, the spell failed, Harry was left with a lightning scar on his forehead and Voldermort became very weak and lost most of his power. Harry was famous in the world of witches and wizards. The Dursleys have always known the truth about Harry but they have an intense fear and hatred of anything abnormal, they believed they could keep the truth from Harry and he would never discover his magical powers. <br />Hagrid takes Harry to London to buy everything he needs for the start of term and his new life at Hogwarts. They enter the Leaky Caldron pub, which can only be seen by witches and wizards, go out the back and into Diagon Alley a street full of magical shops, he discovers that he has a wealth of money in the bank, although the money is in a currency used only by witches and wizards, he gets his cloak, books, caldron, a pet owl and is measured for his wand. Harry returns to his Aunt and Uncle's home until the start of term at his new school. <br />Harry has to get the Hogwort Express to school, it leaves from Kings Cross station out of platform nine and three quarters, between platform nine and ten and only accessible to witches and wizards, but Harry does not know how to get onto the platform, he meets a women with her children and asks for help; here we are introduced to the Weasley family, Mrs. Weasley is a witch, she has four sons and a daughter with her, Percy is a prefect at Hogworts, Fred and George are twins, also at Hogworts and both are practical jokers, Ron is starting his first year and little Ginny is seeing the boys off with her mother. <br />Once on board the train Harry shares a compartment with Ron and Ron's pet rat scabbers, they look forward to their first year at Hogwarts and meeting Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, a great wizard and the only person Volermort fears. The school is in an old castle with hidden rooms and secret passages and Harry becomes best friends with Ron and Hermione Grainger, a very bright girl who is a bit of a know it all; he is introduced to flying on a broomstick, the wonderful sport of Quidditch, mystical creatures, spells, ghosts who wander around the school and he receives a cloak that makes the wearer invisible as an anonymous Christmas present. There are rumours that Voldermort is gathering strength and could regain power. Along with his two friends, Harry is led on an adventure of mystery, riddles and intrigue in an attempt to discover the Philosopher's Stone before Voldermort. <br />The book is full of clues and you think you know what's coming next but you never quite get it right and at the end of the book everything you have read in the two hundred and twenty three pages just fits into place. After reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had to get started on the next book.
B00003CX95|5.0|I have studied the Middle Ages for several years now, and I have never in my life seen a movie, or read a book, that depicts William Wallace, or Edward the Longshanks better.  This movie is absolutly stunning.  Your jaw will be on the floor.  The battles are intense, and bloody, as they really were.  <br />Gibson first got the idea for this movie after reading the book &quot;Robert the Bruce&quot;.  I guess the time of the Bruce family and Wallace grabbed him so much that he made this movie.  Yes, the movie is long, but it will pass in no time, you will wonder where the time went.  From the minute the movie starts, you are awwed by the beautiful landscapes of Scotland and it was filmed so well, that you feel as if you were there.  The acting is great, the costumes are great, and even the speech is great.  Dont miss this wonderful movie.
B000089CKH|5.0|I have never owned another Nada Surf cd, or have I ever heard another song besides popular, but I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and was pleasantly surprised.   Its a little mellow at times, and I believe the standout tracks are the more up-tempo ones, but every song is good.
B00006RU5B|4.0|when i heard that ratm was merging with chris cornell, i wasn't sure how singing would mix with the pure intensity of the ratm instrumental section. well, i must admit chris cornell does a great job. his screams are wonderful and his voice is amazing. the album is great, but it just lacks the unparalleled intensity of de la rocha. thats the key word: unparalleled. nobody can be more intense and in-your-face as de la rocha. but, as i said before, chris cornell does a really good job it just cant be compared with true rage against the machine material. ratm was so intense, soundgarden was so raw, and the combination is almost as intense and almost as raw. this album was almost. definitely four stars.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is definitely the most awaited record of the year, and I have to say, Coldplay really don't disappoint. <br />Though highly derivative from the previous \\"Parachutes\\", \\"A rush of blood to the head\\" is a step forward, with a greater confidence in songwriting and the skills to keep off from the cliches of making a thousand different versions of \\"Yellow\\", which is, IMHO, one of the worst songs they ever wrote. Highlights of this cd are \\"Politik\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\" , the title-track, and \\"Amsterdam\\". It seems that Coldplay know what they are up to, and deliver a classic here. <br />Let' s take a deeper look... I read many reviews and they all seem to differ, I mean they compare this record to U2's Achtung Baby, or Neil Young, but I feel Coldplay are turning a page here. <br />They definitely prove that Parachutes was a - great collection - of mid-tempo-low-key love songs, but instead of sitting on it, they decided they had to change. <br />And what a change. A Rush of Blood to the head is such a masterpiece in songwriting... I mean, Chris Martin's lyrics only have become a thousand miles better than they were before, and any song is definitely more structured, just have a look at the way the endings are made... any song just ends differently from how it started, which is just a sign of a more constructive work in the studio. <br />I think it's really difficult to say \\"Listen to this song if you want to have an idea on this record...\\" , as it is a very uniform and homogeneous effort, in which the only \\"black sheep\\" is the radio-friendly In My Place. <br />I'll just make a list of what is good and what's not so good for each song: <br />Politik - great lyrics and great guitar pattern, though it could have been made much more powerful with a different drumming style. <br />In My place - a good song for kids, a genius 3-note riff that gets stuck in your head, but not much more than it... <br />God Put A smile on you face - Another gem... great acoustic intro, followed by a killer guitar riff, another song which I am not fully satisfied with the drums during the verse, but I have to say the drums are in full fashion in the great choruses. <br />The Scientist - A piano wonder, in which Chris Martin excels... another great ending with the full band. <br />Clocks - A peak of this record, with an hypnotic piano base and - yes ! - a great drumming and bass rythm, definitely a single with style. <br />Daylight - Perhaps the most Parachutes-style track, but in a Radiohead-fashion, if I can say it... It reminds me the rythmic section of some OK-Computer tracks. <br />Green Eyes - A ballad, acoustic guitar in, and then full band follows. It has echoes of some classic guitar-based american rock. <br />Warning Sign - A potential sing with a very smart chorus... with Chris singing \\"and the truth is... I miss you\\" . Surely a hit with the broken hearted. <br />A Whisper - Great rythm section on this one, and a very dark sounding verse, with just a great chorus ... it reminds me some Swervedriver songs... if anybody remembers them ! <br />A Rush of Blood to the head - A marvellous song, in which Coldplay trash a thousand of U2's ballads at one time ! <br />Amsterdam - An amazing piano track, with a good falsetto from Chris Martin... a perfect ending for this high quality album.
B00003CXXM|5.0|WOW, this movie was sooo great.  I read all of the books and loved them all.  I had heard mixed reviews about the movie, and I wasnt to sure if I even wanted so see the awesome book buchered, but ya know, K-Mart was having a sale so I got it for half price.  I am so glad that I got it.  My mom and I sat and watched it and were both shocked as to how good it was.  Matt Damon does a hell of a job and leaves you wanting to see more.  If you havent see this movie yet, do so as soon as you can, also pic up the book and get into that also.
B00003OSTK|5.0|I think this is a really wll sone film.  It's really the deco era through and through.  Greta Garbo is glamerous in it, and th ebeautiful young Joan Crawford is in it as well.  Also John Barrymore, is fabulous in it, very handsome.  I give it as many stars as possible.  It has romance, suspence, drama, sadness, happiness.  A little of everything.<br />It;s a fim about people's llives and loves while staying at the Grand Hotel.  it's definitly a keeper.  The costumes are neat, and some ar every beautiful and stand out.
B0000029GA|5.0|this album is so good, i have only listened to the first four tracks...over and over and over. maybe one day i'll get tired of them and move on to track 5, but i doubt it.
B00007LL7O|5.0|Straovarius can only be sumed up on one word...origional. While the world of heavy metal music is pretty much on the verge of death, Stratovarius steps in to say \\"Hell No!\\" Stratovarius shows the listener that metal does not have to be dark and depressing and does not need to include graphic content. The lyrics and vocals as well as the amazing musicianship fills you with motivation and hope in a time where it is needed the most. Strat has come a long way from \\"Fright Night\\" taking a one of a kind blend of blood pumping guitar and mixing it perfectly with a beautiful classical score. The album includes great concepts from political messages towards the war on terror, to a song dedicated to the movie \\"The Neverending Story.\\" My only dissapointment was the fact that the song \\"Run Away\\" which is included on the \\"Eagleheart\\" single was not included on the actual album. I recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a sound with depth and meaning rather than pointless bubble gum pop. Their sound is truthful and wholesome, but very very loud! Elements Pt.1 ranks up there with Strat's other masterpieces such as Visions and Infinate I highly suggest looking into those albums as well I am eagerly awating Pt.2.
B00000DC10|5.0|I first heard of these guys back in 1999 a few months after they broke up.  I was sitting at home and for some reason watching MTV at 2 am.  Anyway the video for \\"New Noise\\" was played and I was completely blown away by the heaviness of the band.  As I sat there watching the video I realized that they had to be one of the hardest, craziest bands, with a real message that I had ever heard.  I was   I didn't actually buy the album until sometime in 2001 but it remains my favorite album only behind \\"The Clash\\".  If your tired of bands like Rancid, NOFX, and Pennywise and are interested in lefty politics check this album out
B00005OM4N|5.0|If you walked up to someone on the street and asked, \\"What do you think of Britney Spears?\\" there's a 99% chance that the person would say, \\"I am so SICK of her!\\" And maybe that's true. But I can tell you one thing: She has got GREAT music. This CD is brilliant, catchy, and oh-so-entertaining. Definitly the best out of her 3. I love it! Out of most of the artists out there, Britney's music is the best. The songs are so much fun to listen to! Even if you're sick of Britney, if you listen to this CD I guarentee you'll love it. Many of the other pop singers out there who claim they are nothing like Britney (Willa Ford is a good example) have music that is soooo drab and not at all entertaining. There's a reason why Britney sells so many records: she knows music! Maybe there's no denying that you're tired of her, (as Willa Ford loves to say) but her music has power and she's got talent. No denying that.
B000084T18|5.0|Beginning to end this CD is tyte, 50 Cent is realest rapper that has came along in along time. Best songs are \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"High All The Time\\", and \\"Back Down\\". Worth every cent.
B00000HYXB|4.0|A normal American would be naive to think nothing good would rise out of Germany, but then again that person is probably listening to Brittney Spears and Ja Rule records. Blind Guardian is one of the most underrated artists the music world has to offer today. While most stereotype heavy metal music as dark and suicide inducing, Blind Guardian spits in the face of the mainstream, by delivering a hard sound with an artistic concept. What better concept would be appealing than J.R.R. Tolkien's work 'The Lord of the Rings'? Not only that, but the music has deep within it the influence of Renaissance and Middle Ages folk music. These loud, yet harmonious songs bring a world of Hobbits, magic and monsters to life without all the obscenity seen in today's mainstream hard rock and rap albums. Blind Guardian also presents great vocals and musicianship, which is something bands such as Metallica could never give, even when they were halfway decent. \\"Nightfall\\" is a record that music appreciators and Tolkien fanatics will welcome into their homes with delight. I am almost positive that J.R.R. would give his stamp of approval if he were around to hear this band.
0440237688|4.0|The novel \\"The Giver\\" contains many interesting facts about a science fiction world, that is completely controlled. However, there are some aspects that aren't really clear, so that you have to imagine the answers for yourselves, e.g. the open end and why this world was created. Undoubtedly these unanswered questions make this story even more exciting.<BR>All in all it's a very interesting story that is thougt-out well.
078401213X|4.0|Pi was a cinematic masterpiece that left me stunned. Much like Darren Aronofsky's other masterpiece, Requiem, Pi left me speechless. Personally I found Pi much more entertaining than the harsh Requiem for a Dream. Aronofsky does a beautiful job of tying in the mystery of pi, the meaning of life and the tortuous genius of the main character. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
0151008116|5.0|I just want to thank Yann Martel for writing this book. It made the old english major in me feel alive again. I couldn't belive the depth of this book and how it affected me. After I read it I couldn't wait to talk to other people who read it to see if they had the same feelings about it and unanimously the answer has been yes!!!! You will love this book. I think that everyone owes it to themselves to read this book so that you will know what true talent is...and that's Yann Martel!

B000001IPL|5.0|this is a great CD. I mean,when they are still playing two songs from your 1994 CD on the radio, you know you've got a hit.
B00005JKCH|2.0|I saw the movie in the theaters and I walked out ambivalent. I wasn't sure whether to hate the movie or kind of like it. After some deliberation I realized that I was not impressed. The characters were trite and the special effects were too tried.
0375823360|5.0|When I first read the Golden Compass in the middle of January I was repelled by the dull begining, but quickly that changed as I was enveloped in a magical tale of a girl and her daemon, Pantalaimon. The book is full of wonder and kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through. <br />The second book, a great sequel, had me even more, if that's possible, entranced in the continuing journey of Lyra and her new found friend, Will. The book kept rising and rising into epic heights that I haven't experienced in quite a while. The detail Pullman has used to describe ever bit and cranny of his awesome world is just a surrealistic experience. <br />Well anyways, as the book finishes off with a mild cliff-hanger, I devoured the last book as I was once again whisked away and enchanted by Pullman's brilliant trilogy. The last book had, more then the other books, some anti-christian points, but this was appropriately interlaced in Lyra and Will's grand destiny. I don't want to spoil anything but the last book had me laughing at times, on the edge of my seat at others, and saddened as well.<br />Overall, these books may not be for the same audience as Harry Potter, because of it's more mature themes and myriad of descriptors that children in elementary school may not have learned, but when it comes down to it, I feel that this trilogy has sent me away on a magical journey, impossible to duplicate, and something I haven't felt in a long while.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Your precise states that this version was \\"freely\\" adapted from Robert Ludlum's original book. So it was! The very first scene of the movie was true, but the rest of the movie was false. This movie did not even compare with the excitement and suspense of the original story. Action? Car chases? Lip-sucking? Sure! All of the supposedly commercial Hollywood devices to lure folks to the theater. But none of the uniquely Ludlum twists and plot detours that I am used to. For those illiterates that wouldn't even pick up a book, have fun. For us who do bother with old fashioned books, It was a tremendous disappointment. I had intended upon ensuring that I would some day have the whole Bourne series. Now, don't bother.         Ed.....
B00004Z459|1.0|Originality. Innovation. Creativity. Three things utterly lacking from this album. Linkin Park sounds like Staind which sounds like Kid Rock which sounds like Distubed which sounds like Limp Bizkit which sounds like ... well, you get the idea. And yes, I HAVE listened to Hybrid Theory. Rap-Metal is corporate mass-produced noise, a very pale and childish imitation of the inventors of the genre over a decade ago: Faith No More and Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you want some quality rap-metal, check those two out. To be blunt, if you like Linkin Park, it is only because you haven't heard good hard rock music. And that's a shame, because there is so much great music out there that once you heard it, you would never waste your time with Linkin Park or the other corporate clones ever again.
0395645662|3.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is an interesting novel, I read it with my class in 11th grade, but I think I would have read it even if we hadn't done this in class. I like science-fiction stories, so I could compare it to \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" while reading. First of all I have to say that in fact it IS a novel for young adults, its quite easy written and I think easy to follow the story. I liked especially the great imagination of the author, who created a whole new world which is really frightening sometimes. However I detested the open ending, in which the reader is left with a lack of information. Some fantasy-elements, like memory-transmitting, are disturbing the sf-atmosphere, like I want it to be. In contrast to \\"BNW\\" and \\"1984\\" I can hardly imagine any solution or advise for our future which the author might have been thinking of while writing this novel.<BR>All in all it is a good experience to read but if one is one of this hardcore-science-fiction readers (like me) one is dissapointed. My suggestion: read it, if your less than 17 years old!
B00005JKOV|5.0|Waking Life is a jarring, emotionally disturbing experience...if you are in the proper frame of mind.  This is not Hollywood escapism: the protagonist walks around the streets of Austin and engages in largely one-sided bombasts on a variety of philosphical topics (time, mortality, dreams, biology vs. environment).  If you have recently experienced some form of existential anxiety (and given the current \\"terror level\\" I would worry if you hadn't), you should find this film stimulating.  <br />It will not put you at ease.  It will not make you feel better about your job or your family.  It will not offer you a comfortable respite from the chaos of your life.<br />But it will give you something interesting to think about when you go to bed at night.  <br />I also agree with other reviewers: check it out for the rotoscoping effects, if nothing else.  The film is absolutely beautiful.
B0000640VN|5.0|Now this is a flick that really leaves me warm! It has beauty, grace, manners, charm, humor, fantasy, and love at the very end. Nothing needs to be said about a film of this caliber other than it's a must. Oh I could espouse on the actors, but they're not the story - they only play the parts. The photography was absolutely superb, but the Hollywood crowd is so good at that kind of thing that it's kind of a given. The screenplay was extremely well crafted, and this is where the kudos belong. But in the end, it was the entire experience that I reveled in.
B00005JLXC|4.0|First, I have to state that I am a bit of a comic book freak for more than 20 years now; so, it's kind of hard to satisfy me in comparison to a \\"normal\\" viewer as far as comic-adaption movies are concerned...<BR>Nevertheless, \\"Daredevil\\" was a surprise to me! Yes, I did NOT want to have Ben Affleck as the title hero, yes, I think that J. Garner is NO Elektra, yes, I want to see Bullseye with his mask and NOT with a scar on his forehead and yes, MY kingpin is a white meatball (or -mountain rather)! <BR>BUT: the guys did a pretty good job! Not only is the Daredevil of the movie the kind of hero who is dark, full of hate and longing for his kind of justice (=revenge), but B. Affleck really (yes, really) plays him quite well. If you are able to forget the blonde Matt Murdock of the comics, you will see a well-drawn character!<BR>About the coustumes? I hated them when I first saw them on pictures and even more when I saw the trailer!! Guess what? You're getting used to all the leather and the attempts to connect the (old style of the) comics to the new century.<BR>And the story? Well, it seems to me like the pilot episode of an ongoing series... and that doesn't has to be bad after all as long as you've seen enough to yearn for more!<BR>So, and for all the comic-books fans out there: besides the cameos of Stan \\"The Man\\" and Kevin Smith, watch out for the names of some of the characters mentioned in the movie: does \\"Bendis\\", \\"Romita\\", \\"Quesada\\", \\"Miller\\", etc. ring a bell??!! ;-)
B00006LLNU|5.0|I can't imagine anyone calling this souless just because it may not be as dense as the last album with lots of bells and whistles.  That's absurb, to pan something just because you thought the last one was the best thing ever, and you expect the same thing out of &quot;( )&quot;.  It's beautiful art that takes me somewhere..  I would like to see YOU try to make this music.  So what if they're &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; ?  Are you going to tell them how to express themselves.  It's their art.  I know from seeing them live that to call this music souless would be a silly mistake, and I'm sure they would be offended.
B00005JL78|3.0|My son received this DVD for Christmas and I recently reviewed it. The movie was exciting enough, with good 'ole Tom doing his thing, but the basic premise turned out to be totally false! There was no Minority Report! Really, people, how far down the garden path do you intend to lead us?
B000000Y2F|5.0|Ultra-hypnotic grooves; interweaving of diverse styles; a rollercoaster of emotions served up on an audible silver platter.<br />With the downturn in American pop, there's never been a better opportunity to re-explore the true magic of jazz by ones who really know their stuff.<br />Great jazz is this: it stimulates the mind, body and soul and takes you on a spiritual journey.<br />It also rocks pretty ... hard!
B000084T18|4.0|Comparing \\"Get Rich\\" with \\"Guess Who's Back\\" is like comparing Biggie's \\"Ready To Die\\" with \\"Life After Death\\". \\"Ready To Die\\" was pure & heartfelt rap, while \\"Life After Death\\" got more mainstream. <BR>Don't get me wrong, \\"Get Rich\\" is a very good cd, but I do think that it's nowhere close to \\"Guess Who's Back?\\". The Problem is that first of all two of the best tracks on this cd are from \\"Guess who's back\\", and secondly the beats on \\"Get Rich\\" get kinda repetitive after a while! Still, 50 Cent has a very unique flow! He is an incredible good rapper! His voice is kinda a mixture between Ma$e, Big L and Guru. <BR>\\"Get Rich\\" is probably one of the best Rap Cd's out there right now, and can definately be compared to Eminem's \\"The Show\\" and Nas's \\"God's Son\\", still, \\"Guess Who's Back?\\" is better! Just listen to \\"Ghetto Qua Ran\\", \\"Too Hot\\", \\"Rotten Apple\\" or \\"Get Out The Club\\", and you'll hear that these tracks outshine Dre's \\"In Da Club\\", \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"Many Men\\". But again, 50 Cent is hot! I wish him all the best for his future career! RIP Bigge & Pac, Peace!

B00003CXXM|5.0|In the friendly feud between buddies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck we learn that quality certainly beats quantity.  While Affleck seems to be getting into every mass produced piece of garbage under the sun Damon's selectiveness has seen him in some of the best films produced over the past few years.  The Bourne Identity is quite a step away from Damon's typical emotionally charged films and puts him in a more action oriented role.  He pulls it off convincingly.  His character, Jason Bourne, is plagued with amnesia and upon awakening has no recollection of who he was.  On his quest for answers he realizes he has certain talents that normal folks don't normally wield.  Damon's ability to really get the viewer inside the characters head is great here because unlike normal action films you can really get into this one.  Also his calm under pressure convinces you that this character was once something very feared.  The plot itslef is decent.  A nice conspiracy thriller with a few twists here and there.  unfortunately the film doesn't hide the solution too well and if you pay close enough attention, and have seen enough thrillers, you can figure it out.  The action scenes are well done and while not too ridiculous are well choreographed and Damon shows he really mastered the role.  The supporting cast doesn't employ many big names and this is a good thing.  The provide a great web of mystery as the plot unfolds and we even get to see Julia Stiles in an uncharacteristic role.  If you enjoy action thrillers and liked Minority Report then this film is a definate must see for you.
0790729725|4.0|Wonderful movie, if you love the typical Gangster flixs then you should have already seen this!  The movie is the story of a man joining the mafia and his 30 year stint living it up.  The movie is great!  Downsides, are that it is long.  It often times seems even longer then it really is.  I don't know why this is, I can't say it's boring, but it just feels really really long.  Other downside, the last third of the movie.  It doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.  Near the end you start to have the feeling that you are watching something else that isn't bad but not near the quality film that you started.  <br />Buy this movie, but expect the blood gore and cussing that goes along with these kind of movies.
B00005JL78|5.0|After Vanilla Sky I was skeptical about the hype surrounding a Tom Cruise movie however Minority Report proved me wrong.  I knew little about this movie going in and it was a very entertaining movie.  It gets 5 stars from me simply because it was so entertaining not because it has some great message or should be considered a classic of American film.  It was however one of the best action films I have seen in a while.  The plot is gripping as events and evidence unfold and you progress with the main character.  There were some solid actors in the film and I like to see so many lesser known supporting players.  They did a terrific job.  The effects were very well done.  The technology was great in the film and very believable.  The storyline itself was fresh and had nice twists.  There was also a bit of humor in the film which was a nice touch.  I think Tom Cruise is a good actor who sticks to what he knows best.  his character here is a strong willed man great at his job who meets some conspiracy or hardship and has to overcome it while dealing with his personal demons.  This movie is along the lines of Mission Impossible yet I found it to be much better.  There isn't really much more to say and I won't get into the plot because you can read the synopsis.  The only downside to this film I would say is that it is very predictable.  But if you like action thrillers this film is probably one of the best on DVD now.
B000000I0D|5.0|This cd is awesome. If your looking for very good music and fantastic drumming this cd is your best choice.  Mike Oldfield  has put together some very fine music rendations the guitar and drums blend together to form a sound that is mystical and alive .I reccomend  this and give it a 5 star  you must buy it and sit back,close you eyes and enjoy some awesome music
B0000640VO|3.0|Although this is not my normal fair I thought the views of Paris might be entertaining at least!  This flick has all the cute, charming French touches that we have come to expect from their movies.  I found the movie more than a bit choatic, and a bit too quirky at times.  Honestly, if women aspire to be this kind of frustrated, confused woman then they will have an even harder time relating to the dense male sex!  No woman could expect to get anywhere with Amelie's confused outlook on things.  Yes, its cute, but also obnoxious after a while.  I think the movie also suffered from being overly long.  90 minutes would have been more than adequate for a cute, quirky romance like this. Not over 2 hours! I suppose its interesting to see Parisians as screwed up as say New Yorkers in their urban lives, but how much of this do we have to see?!  Perhaps the charm of things French has been dimed lately because of their arrogant politics toward the US in Iraq.  Its hard to say, or maybe my Criossant was a bit stale when I saw this epic!  I really couldn't say, but I think there are far better French movies out there than Amelie for sure.  The views of Paris were nice anyway.  Always good to see paris without having to deal with the French in person!
B00006M183|5.0|After high expectations for the album, i certainly wasn't disappointed. Of course I have my favourites from each album, but two have been added from this masterpiece. Namely I Am Mine and Thumbing My Way. I've read a review asking whether TMW was their most beautiful ballad since Nothingman. Wrong. It's better. Moving, thought provoking and somewhat morbid. eg: 'I'm just walking the mile'. Poetry.  <BR>I Am Mine gives an almost autobiographical view of Vedder in the post 9-11 world. It's just written to perfection.<BR>So if you want bilos riffs and feedbacks, buy a Nirvana album. Don't hold your breath for 'Jeremy grows up' either. Take the album for what it is; wonderful social commentary and even better music. BUY NOW!!!

0802130208|2.0|First, I will admit that this is quite possibly premature, given that I am only 2/3 through the book. But so far it's moderately disappointing. The story is entertaining as so many reviews have pointed out, but I was expecting more.<BR>This book was recommended to me in the course of a conversation about Tom Robbins (as in \\"if you like Robbins, you'll love...\\"), and it has not lived up to the expectations set out in that conversation. I was given to believe that Toole wrote with the same abiding passion for the words he chooses as does Robbins, but I have yet to see that. Sure, Reilly's own musings and proclamations are fun and eloquent, but that eloquence is gratuitous as often as it is anything else. And outside of that, the rest of the book, while it does a good job of character development, is a little on the bland side.<BR>In terms of a literary ride, this is a rollercoaster with one loop, a couple of drops, and a lot of long flat track in between. But if you want a ride on the prose equivalent of a mechanical bull, pick up Tom Robbins.<br />Follow-up - finnished the book and I stand by what I said above.
B00003003R|1.0|This is far and away the WORST album I have ever heard, and I enjoy alot of songs by Guns N' Roses. The problems with the album are many, but I have outlined the most egregious offenses herein.<br />First, the crowd noise overpowers many of the songs, which should have been cleaned up before releasing these live performances. Second, the music overpowers many of the vocals. Third, the melodic tone of a number of the songs is just lost, either because Axle is trying to scream rather than sing, or GN'R is just plain lousy in concert. <br />If you wish to add a CD to your collection of \\"those CDs rarely listened to,\\" then by all means buy this one. Otherwise, stay away ... very far away from this dog.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Jane Austen is a wonderful writer.  Her stories are just as true today as in her day.  She has a great way of getting her ideas about family &amp; relationship across to the reader with such tact &amp; humor.  In my 5 favorite books from Jane, love wins out in the best possible way!
B00006RU5B|4.0|As a long-time fan of Soundgarden (but for some reason, not at all a Rage lover), I picked up Audioslave as soon as I could.  The payoff was fantastic. Cornell and company have combined the best of their former bands and made a masterpiece.  While it could have been a little less derivative of their previous work (as well as classic hard rock acts such as Sabbath and Zeppelin) it shows a mature, yet edgy band making some excellent music.   Highlights:  Set It Off, Cochise and Gasoline.
B00000J7J7|5.0|A brilliant blend of jazz with romantic and modern piano styles(though it would be crass to call it fusion), this long variation set is in the 'great' tradition of piano variation sets (Bach, Beethoven, Rachmaninov and Brahms). Amazing lyricism in the playing, alongside crystal-clear voicing (for example in track 2, 'Resignation') and the ability to cut loose in dramatic fashion. A work (it sounds crass to call it a CD!) that is highly, highly recommended.
B00005JL3A|5.0|You probably know what the movie is about from all the other reviews so I'll just talk about some interesting aspects of the movie commentary which I always like to view after the real movie and maybe you will too.  Director Paul Anderson, Michelle Rodriguez, Milla Jovovich, and one of the producers Jeremy Bolt were all in the commentary, which is quite a crowd to talk in.  A few times all of them talked at once making it difficult to hear, but for the most part it was humorous and informative to hear how the movie was made.  Surprisingly, Michelle was the one who seemed to talk the most and I gained a new respect for her since I'm only familiar with her moody characters (ie Fast & The Furious, Girl Fight).  She had to attend with the other soldier actors a commando school on how to fire weapons, walk commando-like, etc.  Lots of remarks about the sets and how the movie was the director's attempt to have RE be a subtle comparison to Alice in Wonderland (really!).  Milla was engaging, didn't do a prima donna act, but she seemed uncomfortable or didn't comment when the director mentioned how hard she worked and than shot a Loreal commercial between her RE scenes.  Another surprise was that Michelle and Milla were big gameplayers of the RE game and approved of how the director used camera viewpoints similar to the game, the scratching of the dogs nails on the floor, etc.  The director commented mostly on how shots were done, lighting, music soundtrack were done. Jeremy Bolt didn't talk very much, but it was interesting to find out that the budget for this movie was very small so using redundant scenery and actors over and over again was a must. Jeremy ended up being one of the zombies killed, reapplied different makeup on him again and killed him in 2-3 other times.  His sister and girlfriend also got to be zombies probably for no pay.  Other interesting facts about the movie was how the cast was hungover on champagne or wine before a critical battle scene, funny to hear everyone laugh about it.  One sobering fact was the scene at the beginning of the movie when the commandos invade the mansion.  The mansion hall was actually a WWII era nazi bunker w/ padded cells for interrogation.  Chilling to hear how the cast members felt haunted there and wouldn't go anywhere by themselves.  The movie was shot in Berlin so access to this bunker and also an existing underground train system somewhere under the city provided ready made sets w/ minor changes for the movie.  Just some interesting trivia about the movie that I thought was cool so buy the movie and enjoy!

B00005JKDR|5.0|My title may sound a tad cliche, but I believe it. The guys at Pixar understand the mind of children - because they still haven't grown up! That's why Monsters, Inc. is the perfect balance of children's entertainment and adult sophistication. I love it when a studio produces movies that kids love, but at the same time are able to add a level of maturity and sophistication that adults appreciate - without sexual innuendo or appealing to the lowest-common denominator. (i.e. several instances in the movie, Shrek)<br />The animation is simply incredible; the characters are compelling and hilarious; Boo is worth the price of TWO admissions; the plot and backstory are completely ingenious.<br />Buy this movie. Enjoy it. Enjoy Disc 2. (Tons of extras - including \\"Mike's New Car\\" and another Pixar short entitled \\"For the Birds\\" -- PLUS, clips from the Monsters, Inc. office musical production \\"Put that thing back where it came from or so help me...\\" !!) With the possible exception of Toy Story 2, one COULD argue that this is the (or at least ONE of the) greatest animated movies ever made.<br />Sorry if I'm gushing too much. I love this movie. My kids love this movie. It's just plain, good, old-fashinoned FUN.
0440237688|4.0|I think The Giver is a very interesting novel. It shows what advantages and disadvantages such a Community Of Sameness has. Initially you wouldnt think that it is very interesting to read because the whole community is explained and the new words for this novel are menaged, but it gets more and more exciting if you read further. You will feel with Jonas, when he realized how boring the community he lives in is and when he leaves the community. The book has an open ending so it isnt clear what happens at the end.
B00005JL96|5.0|one of my favorite movies ever!... how one could not like a lush, pastel-tinted family movie about the friendship between a nearly autistic genetically engineered weapon of mass destruction and a little hawaiian girl who performs brain surgery on dolls and bites her classmates is beyond me. also, probably has the best hijacking-of-an eighteen-wheeled-fuel-truck-in-order-to-purposefully-drive-it-into-a-volcano-scene as yet committed to film. very nearly makes up for celebration. i will watch it again and again.
0060278269|5.0|What began in \\"Sabriel\\" now ends in a stunning blow, known simply as \\"Abhorsen\\".<br />Many secrets are revealed in this book, including how the bells came to be, who the Disreputable Dog and Mogget are, why the wall was built and what the Ninth Gate in Death looks like. Some readers may find themselves held back by the lengthy descriptions of events and the characters' slow progress in saving the world, but the information you receive is priceless.<br />Though the story likely ends all tales of the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre for good, nothing is lost. While these three books would be wonderful as the beginning of a series, they are also fine the way they have been left. A \\"Harry Potter\\" for older teens and adults, the \\"Sabriel\\" trilogy is the most powerful of our time.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm sure everyone out there is screaming enough of the Teenage pop that is running through the airwaves right about now. When Christina Aguilera released her new cd, i laughed. I bought her past cd, and was very unhappy with it. It reminded me alot of Britany spears. I heard the song Dirrty on the radio and then saw the video, and thought it was extremely trashy, that she felt the need to sell her body, for ppl to buy her cd. But, when her second single, &quot;beautiful,&quot; came out, i woke up. The song is truely amazing, and i found myself listening through the strews of teeny pop music, just to hear the song. I went online, just to see, and downloaded the song, Walk away, by Miss Aguilera, and was hooked. I played the song over and over, day in and day out. The song is an AMAZING piece of work. I got the cd for Christmas, and have not taken it out of my cd player yet. Every song on here has a meaning, and not one of them can be dismissed, not even dirrty, which I had so many times before.
0060005424|5.0|Have you ever been in a position where you felt much too old for something, but had no way to get out?

0676973779|5.0|I felt cynically, at first, that the author had selected this subject - survival - because, as he mentioned in notes at the beginning of his book, his second novel was not successful and he therefore chose a subject that claims attention to-day.   However, after reading the novel and giving it some thought I believe it is about the journey from innocence to experience.   I connected William Blake's poem, &quot;The Little Black Boy&quot; in his &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; and his poem &quot;Tyger&quot; in &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; to this novel and I think the author is telling of overcoming racism and all challenges faced in the world to-day. In other words,  the emergence from innocence through experience to strength and survival.<BR>Elaine Bunbury (author)<BR>&quot;What Hope Have You!&quot;
B000031WD9|4.0|The three words that make this average teen-sex comedy watchable. Overall, the film itself is just like any other teen-sex comedy since the 1980's.<br />The extras are absolutely wonderful on this disc set. The deleted scenes are pretty good, some of which should've stayed in the film, others that were deftly left out for a reason.<br />All in all, the disc is solid.
0321146530|4.0|Test-Driven Development is one of the few technical books that I have gotten a great deal of pleasure out of reading. At times it feels like Kent Beck is right beside you teaching you the concepts in a way that rings true. Beck does not simply present the techniques in a set of dry rules to be followed. You get a feel for how he has learned this method of development, which is a better way for me to learn as well.<br />The only complaint about the book that I have is that the second larger example on xUnit is disappointing. It comes across as though Beck wanted to play with Python and as he states, the way he learns a new language is to implement xUnit. However, from a reader's perspective, I found the chapter confusing and not very helpful over the first money example. I would really have liked to see a more realistic example dealing with a business application and the issues of test-driving databases and GUIs. <br />However, the book is a joy to read and is nice and small. I hate 1000 page tech books, and this one is easy to carry. Highly recommended!
B000062XM7|3.0|I have not heard of this movie until about a month ago. And yet I'm suprised to see (so far) this movie is getting 5 stars for advange custmor rviewrs, because I see that very rarely. Plus a lot of good movies like Lilo &amp; Stitch, Stuart Little and Like Mike, are not getting an advnage of 5 stars. I would give you a lukewarm reccomendtion if you like movies with very little (or no swearing) at all. When the movie ended, I was confused by why the MPAA had given it a R rating. I guessed and I was right, that it was rated R for vilonce. Plus this is a very rare movie that the whole movie is shown in &quot;letterbox&quot; format on video. I have and used to &quot;letterbox&quot; format being shown on dvd. But if you love movies in &quot;letterbox&quot; format, I would recomed you to watch this film. But I don't think this movie is worth 5 stars because this movie is cofuses on either by what you have seen in the movie and why it got rated R.

B000069AUI|5.0|Being a huge Coldplay fan from England, I felt compelled to see what people thought of them in USA. Coldplay are now the biggest band in Europe without a doubt, and it looks set to stay that way for long time. <br />This album is quite simply breath-taking at times and is already known as a 'Classic' in England. Chris Martins voice delivers beautiful music with the added element of good old fashioned English indie rock. The collaboration of piano, guitars and drums is amazing. Stand out tracks are 'In My Place', 'The Scientist', 'Amsterdam', The pounding opener 'Politic', 'Clocks' and 'A Rush of Blood to the Head'. All of which remain ringing in the memory after playing. <br />If you liked Parachutes you will probably already have this, but if you don't, this is a must have. Anyone one whos just heard one or two tracks and are just wondering about buying it. Well, it gets better.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|You know, I have always supported Prince through rain sleet or snow. I knew when I saw the cover that looked like something from \\"Good Times\\" it was over! I ran out and got this because the reviewers were so generious. So I said, O.K I didn't really appreaciate his \\"Rave Un 2 concert being packed and conjested with has beens, but he may deliver something funky and upbeat. Because Goodness knows The \\"Rave album\\" was extremley cheesy immitations of what he use to do with passion. Little did I know that these old school has beens that performed at the Rav concert had influences on him. When I got home and hear the first 3 tracks, I was preying that the tempo would pick up. This is a very very boring cd and lacks exuberance in a huge way. I cannot believe he traded his signature electronic innovative futuristic sound for the likes of basic old school jazz. This isn't a innovative or unique sound at all this is no different that any other Jazz artist. The only song that has any exuberance at all is 1+1+1=3 and it is an \\"Erotic City Retread !\\" But I thank merciful G, that was on there to pick up the pace. How are you going to be so one sided musically when you have all these different nationalites that support you? This is the most boring Prince effort I have ever heard. It sounded like he was sleeping when he wrote the music for these songs. This is a Pitiful shame someone so talented that once pressed Foward is going in Reverse! This cd shows that even though he still looks young he is every bit of his age. People can support this all they want but this is really about the last straw 4 me! Ya know the lyrics are one thing but the music is another. In my opinion this is a depressing effort musically and lyrically, just plain depressing!<BR>How? well in two ways the message and the lack of upbeatness and energy in the music. If I want to listen to laid back music I will listen to Trip Hop(Portishead/Tricky as Example), it's a hell of alot more creative than this! This issome old folks music and prejudice and militant at that! What happened to \\"Anna Stesia, Love thy will B done, Joy and Repetition and I wish U heaven? What even happened to sonic and mid tempo electronic tracks like \\"Space\\" that took you somewhere different? Those songs (Other than Space) had religious overtones and were mellow and far more creative, universal and superior than these. In all honesty people say his best works were in the 80's I agree somewhat. But he had some really great cd's in the 90's here and there, But he just wasn't getting the radio support to drill it in like the 80's. And we all know why because of his lack of interest to go along with WB's. And after the split he was pretty much finished commercially, so we got alittle exposure hear and there. Emmancipation, Crystal Ball, Come ,The vault, New Power Soul, Gold Experience and Exodus makes a this album sound like it was made in 1970. But Oh, I forgot the simple people, sometimes you have to please them! And this is definitley a album that is geared more so for people who don't like eclecticness or artisticness! This album follows the same formula from beginning to end, unlike his other efforts in past. There are no rock dance fusion or eclectic innovative works, this is strictley old school boring jeverish! If you are expecting the diversity his other efforts gave forget it this is a straight jazz neo soul album. I am so sad to see this happen to such a creative and innovative past Icon. I don't like Micheal Jackson's new effort but at least his sound is modern and he's trying. This is a mediocure, dated and sad jazz / militant Johovah's recruitment best.
B000084T18|5.0|Too many haters tryin to say he ain't as good as artists in the past....  Fact is, as of today, 50 &amp; Em are the best rappers out there that actually put out good beats on their cuts..  Luve to Nas' God Son cause that had beats this time too..  50's flow is right on with the melody, which wastes other rappers inability to do the same..  Jam Master Jay tought you right, 50..  I personally like every cut.  Heat would be the one that I would say I like the least of all of them, but I still don't skip it...  This cat is the rapper of this era..  If he keeps the mixtapes flowin like he did before, he will basically be the only rapper to constantly be puttin new shi out there on the streets... Not the artist that only drops one cd every 2-3 years...  He raps what he knows, which is the life of the streets...  Check this out, he's humble as a mutha fugga too...  Most cat's be tryin to act tough..  That's a different thing bout this cat... He wasn't even cryin when they started bootleggin his shi too, sayin that he's already financially happy, so as long as people got the album, he was happy....  People can hate greatness all they want, but no one can touch him.. Em is stackin his deck wit his new label so Murda inc. and the rest need to watch out for 2k3....  50, do your thing man...  It's been a week and you're cd still hasn't came out my deck....  and it won't for a while either!  Can't wait for G-Unit to drop this year too... Lloyd Banks and Tony YaYo got heat too...  Peace.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Before trying to criticize Director's Name Here Daredevil, you must first take a look back at the comic derived movies of the past. I say this with more recent films such as Sam Raimi's Spiderman and Director's Name Here's X-men in mind, but, in particular, Daredevil  brought the earlier half of the Batman franchise to mind, that is, while Tim Burton was still in charge, and Joel Schumacher (Batman & Robin, Batman Forever) was keeping his filthy hands far, far away.<BR> I mention these movies because Daredevil makes a deliberate attempt to steer away from many of their standards, thus making it the most daring \\"Comic movie\\" in the slew of these films. The most noticeable difference is the film's turn towards brutality. Most of the previous films shied away from the subject of death completely, leaving their character's last moments suggested, but never shown.  Daredevil however, is a much darker film than its predecessors. It takes a full on approach to bloodshed, pushing its PG-13 rating to the limit. We witness characters being run over, stabbed, shot, and much, much worse. Whether or not this new attitude towards violence is welcomed by the audience, I can only wonder. For me, and I hate to sound morbid here, it provided the movie with enough grit to save it from some potentially sappy moments in the screenplay. <BR> The plot (in as few words as possible, because I'm running out of space here) is as follows: Matthew Murdock is a bullied child living in Hell's Kitchen with his father, a washed up prize-fighter. After Matt is blinded in a freak accident involving radiation, he is blinded, though his other four senses, notably his hearing, are improved, and his father is beaten to death by gangsters, Matt vows to protect the underdogs of the city, becoming a lawyer by day, and an angry, vengeful superhero by night. He is thus pitted against the Kingpin, who seemingly rules all crime in New York City, and his protog, Bullseye. In addition to all of this, he falls inlove with Electra (Jennifer Garner), a sassy martial arts expert who, through a series of events which I haven't got the space to delve into here, turns against him.<BR>Out of all the movies I mentioned above, Daredevil finds most of its roots in Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns. These are two films noted for their atmosphere (I've yet to find any movie that can match Gotham City's corruption and greed), their dark nature, and above all, their villains. Daredevil, as I mentioned above, is most definantly dark, and its atmosphere does provide it with its own distinct feel. What Burton and Director's last name here both agree on most of all, however, is that being bad is so much more fun than being good. It's more fun to watch as well. Batman was always in the shadows of his villain's wickedly unique personalities, and here, Daredevil pales in comparison to the true evil of The Kingpin (Micheal Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Collin Farrell). Both of these characters are vividly imagined, each with their own distinct approach towards evil. This is greatly to the credit of the actors portraying them. Both are perfectly cast, Micheal Clarke Duncan providing his usual macho presence, and Farrell's portrayl of the psychotic Bullseye was nothing short of brilliance.<BR> Despite all of this, Daredevil does have its share of flaws. The romantic relationship between Electra and Matt was  just asking too much for me. Normally I forgive any implausibilities in comic book movies, as, after all, it's based on a comic book. It's not supposed to be realistic. Their relationship, however, pushed me to the limit. Within minutes of screen time together they fall deeply in love, their conversations simply too sappy to bear. This steals away far too much precious time from the plot, which, at a brisk 96 mins. long, is stretched thin as it is. The breakneck pace of the movie as it tries to fit into such a short time slot infringes on its quality as well.
0440237688|4.0|I think the novel \\"The Giver\\" written by Lois Lowry was quite a good one. <br />At first,it was confusing, because it sometimes was difficult to understand the context and the strukture of the community. Later it became more and more interesting. It was interesting to see in which way people can be controlled. I would like to know how the story really ends, because there is an open end.<br />If you are interested in Science Fiction, then you should read this novel!

6304698542|3.0|When I originally saw the film many years ago, I felt it was an extremely remarkable piece of &quot;History&quot; which had occurred in a time when the rest of the world was in deep depression prior to the second world war.  Now having recently seen it again and being able to compare it to Sam Mendes stage interpretation of the same story, i feel that the original film leaves a lot to be desired.  Liza Minelli's portrayal of a wide eyed innocent American dancer is historically wrong.  The story is better told when the character reverts to an English girl whose suitor is an American visiting Berlin. It would apprear that the film producers believed they needed Liza to pull off the film and reversed the nationalities of the main characters.<br />I still enjoy watching Caberet, however, my personal memories of the recent staging of Caberet as previously mentioned hold a truer belief in accuracy of history.

B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Bubl's voice is an exceptional instrument. His phrasing and his stylish interpretations are different with each track. There is not a single cut on this CD that sounds the same. Kudos to Bubl, David Foster, and his arranging and orchestration crew. Each track is a little slice of something different and each of them EXTREMELY tasty. His arrangements are artistic, emotional, thoughtful, tasteful, and every other positive word ending in &quot;ful&quot; that I can think of. String orchestrations are lush, full and dripping with good stuff. The big band arrangements simply swing a la Nelson Riddle in his collaborations with Frank Sinatra. Michael puts a personal touch to each song, claiming them for his own. If you love great music, you must get this CD!

B0000029DD|5.0|I'm often asked, &quot;What type of music does he play?&quot; Hard to say (and even harder to follow up with, &quot;Actually... played.&quot;). Jeff Buckley's music defies category, which makes it appealing to those who are appreciative of all genres of music, but naturally it also becomes harder to market. The ephemeral tastes of those who dabble in whatever music is &quot;of the moment,&quot; I predict, won't find what they're looking for here. Those who appreciate a soaring, nearly five-octave vocal range, quality musicianship, and masterful, melodic lyrics should give Jeff Buckley a chance. This is powerful stuff.
B000069KE0|3.0|So, why do you want to purchase this album?  Have a scratched LP copy?  Interested in the wonderful music Chicago produced?  If so, then here's the plusses and minuses of this purchase.  This review is *not* designed to pass judgment on the band as a whole, just about this purchase.<br />This album has great Chicago songs: Wake Up Sunshine, So Much to Say, So Much to Give, Colour My World, Fancy Colours, 25 or 6 to 4...and over the middle stretch of this originally four sided LP, the album has a thematic structure like a rock opera. Unfortunately, the entire first side (from Moving In to In the Country) has no redeeming value. One boring song after another.  Side four (It Better End soon and Where Do We Go From Here) isn't listenable either -- both make lame excuses for Vietnam era songs. If you can't get the great songs any other way, then get this CD.
B0000009S3|5.0|Basically just dropping the name `Mothers of Invention' and releasing this as his first solo album, Mr. Zappa showed, who had been boss all the time, and let the unsuspecting music world cop it in the teeth with this blast of basically instrumental work. Gone were the dropping off into the world of parody or spoken word humour, that had often enlivened, but more often marred `The Mothers' albums. A joke is only funny the first couple of times, but soon becomes annoying, especially after repeated playing in between bits of your favorite music.<br />But here on `Hot Rats' Mr. Zappa surrounds himself with some of the finest musicians in the United States of America, who just happened to also be his best friends, and went from cult figure to International Superstar. In the high brow student world of 1970, if you didn't have the Hot Rats poster in your bed sit, you were considered very square. The album was an absolute `must have'. (Mind you it was also required to wear your hair down to your ankles, platform boots 2 foot tall, huge bell bottom trousers that hid them anyway, say things like \\"Cosmic\\" or \\"Groovy\\" a lot, and end every sentence with \\"Man\\". Eat your heart out Austin Powers, looking back it all seems terribly complicated now.)<br />But that was one thing that Mr. Zappa had mastered, although all of the playing on this album is intricate in the extreme, with great lolloping extended solos and each song has a terribly gripping hum able tune that makes your fingers twitch and your feet tap.<br />The first piece of music presented here for your edification (it would almost be an insult to label them down as just plain old songs) is the wonderfully monickered \\"Peaches En Regalia\\", where Mr. Zappa on guitar, and multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood get to flex their musical muscles. These two musicians are the only two to appear on every track. \\"Peaches En Regalia\\" is certainly one of Mr. Zappa's most commercial and popular tracks and, almost certainly, one of his best. In an amazing way the album starts, leading us into a treasure trove of sound. Yes, this was what started what is called `Jazz/Rock', but at the time it was just a convenient label for journalists to put it under. Mr. Zappa should not take the responsibility for the driveling of some, who tried to follow in his footsteps.<br />Next up is the infamous \\"Willie The Pimp\\" the only vocal track on the album sung by the esteemed Don Van Vliet, better known as `Captain Beefheart', and what lyrics they were too!<br />\\"I'm a little pimp with my hair gassed back<br /> Pair of khaki pants with my shoe shined black\\"<br />You can hear the gleam in the great Captain's eye, the guitar solo that follows will take the roof off your head every time you hear it. And remember, Steve Vai was an apprentice of Mr. Zappa's for many years and has never been able to step out of his shadow.<br />After \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\", and for this album the short \\"Little Umbrellas\\", you get the full version of \\"The Gumbo Variations\\". This had to be severely edited for the vinyl release due to time constraints, but now with the wonders off compact discs, you get the whole thing remastered from the original tapes, all but seventeen minutes (what's three seconds between friends), where the soloists, Mr. Zappa guitar, Ian Underwood everything, and Sugar Cane Harris on violin, all vie for the spotlight, holding your attention with every nuance of sound.<br />Then finally we get \\"It Must Be A Camel\\" (the title of which sounds like something J.K. would say out on the golf course after a bad night), where the legendry Jen Luc Ponty joins the fray to bring it all to a fitting climax.<br />A truly magnificent collection. If it's not in yours, make it so.<br />You may notice the artist referred to as Mr. Zappa through out this review commanded a fair amount of respect, did the Guvnor.<br />Mott the Dog.st.

B000006MS3|5.0|Hasn't anyone done their doctoral thesis on this album?  It's certainly deserving of such treatment.  A psychologist would have a field day deciphering the multi-personality multi-dimensional themes.<br /><br />I totally agree with the reviews suggesting this isn't an album for \\"beginners\\" or Kate newbies or for anyone that watches lots of commercial TV.<br /><br />You have elements of harder rock (Sat In Your Lap), lush treatments (Night of the Swallow), and sort-of-ballads (All the Love), and truly bizarre/occult/psychic dementia (Get Out Of My House, and to a lesser extent, Leave It Open).

Better yet though, purchase Kate's first five albums instead and you'll be so much better off for it.

B0000542DG|5.0|In the final analysis \\"Final Destination\\" benefits from a pair of veterans from \\"The X-Files,\\" director James Wong and co-writer Glen Morgan, and an extremely helpful initial test screening (see the nice little feature on the DVD with regards to the latter).  This film is one of the bloodiest splatter flicks I have seen in some time (it cannot be considered a slasher flick because there is no slasher and I have to add a caveat in that I have not been watching as many films in this genre as was my wont in my younger days).  But rather than focusing on the blood and gore you are distracted by the ingenious ways the dead teenagers in this movie end up becoming dead.  There is something to said for any movie that finds Rube Goldberg to be a creative inspiration.<br />Once upon a time there was a class of high school students who were going to take a class trip to Paris.  Before the plane takes off Alex (Devon Sawa) has a terrifying vision of the plane exploding.  When he wakes up a couple of things from his vision immediately come true and he starts yelling the plane is going to explode.  There is a big commotion and Alex, five other students and a teacher, end up getting kicked off the plane.  The good news, relatively speaking, is that the plane does indeed explode and their lives have been spared.  The bad news, which takes up the remainder of the film, is that having cheated Death the grim reaper wants to settle accounts.  Once again, Alex is ahead of the loop on this one and the question is whether he can convince the rest of the group of what is going on and figure out what to do to stop it from happening before the final credits.<br />\\"Final Destination\\" is a film where the characters are caught up with who is going to die next while the audience is waiting to find out how.  Not \\"how\\" as in what handy implement will Jason find in some \\"Friday the 13th\\" movie but more in the tradition of Vincent Price's \\"Dr. Phibes\\" films.  But the film does not overplay its hand in this respect and mixes long intricate mousetrap scenarios with startling sudden staccato scenes as well.  Bottom line: this is a splatter flick that delivers on the basis of brains as well as blood.<br />This is not to say that the movie is without its flaws, the most notable of which is that parallel to TWA Flight 800, which also involved students on a flight to Paris.  Was there really no one involved in the making of this movie that did not notice this was in extremely bad taste and totally unnecessary?  It could have been any other city on the planet and it did not even have to be on the far side of the ocean.

Not that anybody would have believed him, but at least it was a rationale explanation for his behavior.

Bottom line: this is a splatter flick that delivers on the basis of brains as well as blood.<br />This is not to say that the movie is without its flaws, the most notable of which is that parallel to TWA Flight 800, which also involved students on a flight to Paris.  Was there really no one involved in the making of this movie that did not notice this was in extremely bad taste and totally unnecessary?  It could have been any other city on the planet and it did not even have to be on the far side of the ocean.

B00005JLXC|5.0|Forget that piece of cinematic garbage called 'Spider-man'. Daredevil, one of Marvel's lesser known characters, strikes gold in this gritty, no holds barred film version. Mostly based on the Frank Miller era of DD, this film is everything Spider-man or Batman should have been, and much more. Daredevil literally comes to life in ways you will not expect. The cast is exemplary- Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clark Duncan are all excellent. The film does seem a little on the choppy side, but apparently, it had to be cut to accomodate a PG 13 rating. Overall- a great film, destined to become a cult classic. Without doubt, the best Marvel comics adaption to date. An extended DVD director's cut will be most welcome, and should garner it a 5 star rating....
1559277246|5.0|While it took me about 4 cd's before I got used to this newest reader,  the storyline itself overcame any reluctance I had to continue listening to this eighth entry into the wonderful world of the Plum mysteries.  Stephanie is at her best, bumbling, fumbling and drooling, first over Ranger and then over Morelli.  I like the interaction between Stephanie and the men in her life, both of them bring so much into this story that I'd feel lost without either of them.  And Vinnie's character has a chance to develop in this story, as well as sister Valarie.  As usual Stephanie meets some new zany friends and some new bad bad bad guys.  And they are bad guys.  The book got a little dark here,  but I expected that sooner or later Stephanie would meet up with crooks who weren't bumbling fools.  And Mrs. Plum actually has her moments in this latest offering from the wonderful Ms. Evanovich.  This book is an absolute must read for Plum addicts,  and if you thought you had heard everything in the Morelli/Ranger situation, hold onto your hats!!  I can't say I would recommend this reader for future audio books,  although I did finally get used to her and the accents she used,  but give me Lori Petty or Debbie Mazar any day!!!  And give me a new Plum mystery soon!!!
B000007489|5.0|This is one of the top punk albums of all time. Everything is right with this release. I loved it in the 80's and I still love it now. This is ST before the Punk/Metal crossover that happened on latter releases. ST broke the Punk/Metal boundary, they broke racial boundaries, they broke the social boundaries, they were Suicidal Tendencies.
0060523794|1.0|As a 35 year IBMer, I survived the Cookie Monster years.  I found this book very shallow and self-serving. It may have been written to  justify to the author, in his own mind, why he destroyed what was once the best corporation in the world. He glosses over the 100,000 people he laid off and never even addressed the rape of the pension plan. Forutnately, I didn't buy this book, it was a gift so no more of my money went into his pocket.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This album is horrible and the 5 star reviews on here don't even know how to use proper grammar! Enough said! &gt;:(
B000002KD5|5.0|This album tells the story of what you get when you add two starving musicians from California to a well-known British Blues band. The result it, of course, the Fleetwood Mac that we have all come to know and love.<BR>This album is breathtaking. There isn't a bad song on it. And there's something for everyone...&quot;World Turning,&quot; &quot;Say You Love Me,&quot; and &quot;Blue Letter&quot; will have you singing along in no time. &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; and &quot;Rhiannon&quot; are perfect for the dramatic types. &quot;Crystal&quot; is just beautiful and is sure to grab the attention of everyone listening. <BR>And then there's &quot;Landslide,&quot; which is (simply put) a legend all in itself.<BR>Buy the album...you won't be disappointed.
B000065V9Y|5.0|I just bought this album not knowing any of the other songs on it besides &quot;Steam&quot; and I must say that this is a great album. Much more worldly and and a little brighter than SO, &quot;US&quot; is a marvelous follow-up to the 1986 smash. My favorite songs are the haunting &quot;Loved To Be Loved&quot;, the upbeat &quot;Only Us&quot;, and the closing track &quot;Secret World&quot;. &quot;14 Black Paintings&quot; is like an echoing of the &quot;Passion&quot; soundtrack with it's strong Middle Eastern flutes. Peter Gabriel once again delivers a great set of songs. It would unfortunately be a decade before the follow-up &quot;UP&quot; would be released and that one was worth it. This might sound odd but I think &quot;UP&quot; has some similarities to this, Kind of like PG 3 meets &quot;US&quot;. This album is a must-have. Get all of Gabriel's albums.
B000084T18|5.0|I think that the album from 50 Cent is a great debut. I really liked all the songs, especially &quot;In Da Club&quot;.<br />The album is off the hook and I definitely recommend it to every fan of hip-hop.
B000002OR4|5.0|As other reviewers mention, this score sort of \\"legitmized\\" John Williams as more than a composer of catchy romance-adventure music.  Because Williams is always faithful to the story being told onscreen, it took a film like \\"Schindler's List\\" to allow Williams to lead us into the sublime.  <br />The opening theme is fairly pleasant, kind of mysterious, with a nice violin lead by Itzhak Perlman.  The next track, \\"Jewish Town\\" also lets us off pretty easy.  The violin does have its pathos, but overall it's more stately than sad.  We're still being eased into the dignified, ancient structures of Jewish music.<br />With \\"Immolation,\\" it really begins.  The tension and uncertainty in the strings gives way to the choir; the starving and tormented citizens of Krakow will not be silent.  This piece also begins the smartest tactic of the whole score - Williams keeps using the melody from the opening, but in different keys based on the events of the film.  It's a happy melody the first time; track to track, it becomes less so.<br />\\"Schindler's Workforce\\" is sort of the juggernaut of the score  at over ten minutes.  It's a reprieve from the drama of the  prior two pieces, just as working in the factory is a reprieve from being murdered.  For \\"I Could Have Done More,\\"  the orchestration is subdued, and we start to hear the sublime.  When the key changes to E-minor at 3:46, the last barrier between the listener and the tragedy of the story is removed.<br />With \\"Auschwitz - Birkenau,\\" the violin and strings express the rage and desperation of the death camp.  Williams no longer seeks to comfort us, and reality takes hold.  The choir returns for the gentle, haunting \\"Stolen Memories,\\" and so the tension is briefly set aside.  (Acoustic guitar is an unexpected pleasure here.)  \\"Making The List\\" could be considered the dramatic climax of the score, and the piece which sounds most like something from \\"Star Wars.\\"<br />\\"Give Me Your Names\\" is somewhat maudlin for two minutes...thenit fades back into the opening theme, undiminished for all the turmoil that has come since the start of the score/film.  Genius.  Finally, the closing \\"Reprise\\" of the theme is heartbreaking in its beauty.  It isn't loud or strident, but it sounds like resurrection and redemption and families being reunited at the end of everything.<br />Yes, I've gone on and on and rhapsodized about this score.  If you hear it, you'll understand why.  You'll also get why the word \\"tears\\" is used in so many reviews for this album.
0920668372|5.0|I enjoy this book so much because it really touches my heart. There's always been a special bond portrayed between a mother and her child and this book states everything perfectly, down to the very last line. I cry every single time I read this book because I think of it as simple, children's poetry portraying this special love a mother has for her child and in the end, the way the son portrays his love for his mother. I don't know of anyone who hasn't read or been read this book at a baby shower or at another place. It's completely appropriate for a baby shower and, just incase you decide to read it at a shower, have a box of Kleenex nearby!
B00005NP04|5.0|Take Linda Ronstadt's clear, strong, perfect voice ... stir in Dolly Parton's authenticity and social awareness ... add a dash of Melissa Etheridge's big, arena-ready sound ... and you'll probably get something very close to Martina McBride.  I suppose it's debatable whether Martina McBride is \\"one of the world's best singers,\\" as her producer Paul Worley gushes in the liner notes of this CD.  You won't get any arguments from me, however.  McBride is an unusually strong vocalist, regardless of genre. Her voice is unwavering and her phrasing is absolutely impeccable.  Straddling the line between pop and country, her performances always ring true whether it's the soaring, rock-flavored \\"Safe in the Arms of Love,\\" the down-home raveup \\"When God Fearin' Women Get the Blues,\\" or the hushed heartbreaker, \\"Concrete Angel.\\"<br />As this CD proves, McBride's material has been magnificent throughout her career.  Even the early tracks sound great.  It's nice to have a CD with songs that actually say something, too.  Sure, there are several love songs, but you'll also find social commentary here and there (\\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Concrete Angel\\") that bites without being heavy-handed. In fact, there isn't a dud here, and when's the last time you could say that about a CD containing 19 tracks?  This is country-pop of the highest caliber.  Recent Faith Hill converts would do well to pick up this CD.
B00005JLXC|3.0|Well it's another comic book movie and what can we do.  We have to see it.  Well at least I did.  I did't expect much from this movie considering I barely knew anything about daredevil and of course Ben Affleck.  I mean has he ever been in a great movie?  Anyway, I gave this movie three stars because it was not fantastic, but it didn't completely blow.  Just go into this movie looking for lots of fun unrealistic action.  Two things save this movie.  1) Jennifer Garner, who looks amazing, <br />2)Colin Farrel, who is pretty funny as bullseye.  I won't tell you much about the story because you probably already know it, but there's really not much to tell.  Bad guy versus good guy.  Bottom line, there are much better movies out (The Pianist, The Hours), but if your like me you just want to see this one.

0440237688|4.0|An exciting book which makes you think about the world around you. Youre pleasured about things like music, love and colors and feelings you are able to have. On the first view the story seems to be boring and uninteresting, but after some chapters you notice that it is a very complex system. That explains why the book is not appropriate for people without imagination. However, the open ending can be quite frustrating!

6305291446|4.0|There came a point in the Halloween series where it lost its ideas and just became a hack job of films. The first two movies were great, telling the story of Michael Myers first night of terror over a collective three hours. But after a third film which had nothing to do with Myers, the killer came back as a clone of Jason Vorhees, with none of the freshness of the original film. But then along came Halloween: H20, which disregarded all but the first two films and successfully reunited the killer and Jamie Lee Curtis.<br />The secret to its success is how it ignores the poor sequels and brings the story right back to its origins. Forcing Laurie (Curtis) to confront the terror that has plagued her over the 20 years since that Halloween night, the film pays ample homage to the first two films without feeling like a soulless retread. Instead, it focuses on how such a traumatic event can haunt a person so harshly, their life constantly teetering on the edge of despair. Yes Myers is back, but except for a murderous opening, the film spends its first half on Laurie, on her alcoholism and her relationship with her son, now the age she was on that fateful Halloween night. And when Myers does finally show up, were ready for him, because we know the characters well, we understand them and honestly want to root for them.<br />In addition to paying tribute to some memorable scenes of the original films, Halloween H20 also fits in a fantastic scene with Curtis real life mother Janet Leigh, of the original Psycho. If youd never seen that film, youd never realize what the scene represented. Its beautifully subtle, an absolute surprise for a slasher flick. And without spoiling the end, the film concludes the Myers story in a fitting way (if you ignore the dismal follow-up Halloween: Resurrection, which destroys the fantastic conclusion).<br />For fans of the original Halloween films, the ones that were actually good, Halloween H20 is a fantastic return to form. Consider it the real Halloween III, the final chapter in a great horror trilogy, and ignore all the others.
0440237688|3.0|We live in Germany and we read this book in our English lessons.<BR>Although I thought that I wouldn`t like it because it is a story which takes place in the future it is interesting.<BR>From my point of view I can imagine the feelings of Jonas. <BR>Finally I would recommend this novel because it isn`t like each normal and predictable book!
B00006L85B|5.0|THE KING OF LATIN POP IS BACK ONCE AGAIN. THIS IS A COLLECTIBLE EVERY FAN MUST HAVE. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE OLDER ALBUMS. THESE ARE THE SONGS THAT TAKE YOU BACK. SONGS FROM ARMANDO MANZANERO, AGUSTIN LARA, ROBERTO CANTORAL ECT...THIS CD/DVD COMBO ALSO INCLUDES A LYRIC BOOK AS USUAL. THE CLARITY ON THE DVD IS NOT SO GREAT. IT WAS JUST SOME OF HIS OLDER VIDEOS REVAMPED. ALSO, INCLUDES EXCELLENT BONUS TRACK \\"HASTA QUE VUELVAS\\". I HEAR IT OVER AND OVER.
6305265666|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and definatly my fav Drew Barrymore movie.  It's not like the typical Cinderella fantasy story that is often seen in re-makes.  Danielle (aka Cinderella) is very strong minded, has a beautiful soul, and yet longing for love since her father died.  She is stuck with her wicked step mother and one wicked step-sister(the other one is nice to her).  It is actually the prince who is quite immature and lost in life, until he meets his lovely match.  I try to watch this movie about once a month and i always fall in love with it over and over.  The score, acting, setting, locations are wonderful.  Don't miss this Cindy movie(skip on Maid in Manhattan...blah)!
B0000027DJ|5.0|I'm relatively new to Alice outside of \\"Alice Cooper's Greatest Hits\\". This album has become one of my favorites in a very short time, it's very good, and very consistent. If you like any sort of melodic Hard Rock/Metal, along the lines of Skid Row, Kiss(Revenge), or Bon Jovi, you'll like this. This is still commercial, but in a much more subtle manner then Trash. Hey Stoopid is to Trash what Slave to the Grind is to the self-titled Skid Row album, if you know Skid Row. I highly recommend this.
0151008116|3.0|I was definately looking forward to this one.  Booker Prize!  Canadian writer!  Lots of gushy quotes!<BR> Well, I may have missed something, but while I felt the first half was wonderful and warm and surprising, and the rest of the book had its moments, I just couln't stay particularly excited about a book that turned into a how-to manual on surviving in a life boat with a tiger for 277 days.  Or perhaps I could have taken this for 50 pages or so, but not 150.  It really reminded me of a bunch of children's books I read back in the day: Swallows and Amazons, and Swiss Family Robinson and so on, only with less of a point, or a least less of an entertaining pay off.<BR> Although I will say that the algae island was very good.  And I did like Pi's name.
B0000028PI|3.0|I picked this up for $...one day, not expecting much. It's actually a good, solid album. I don't think it's close to being as good as Hey Stoopid or Trash, or on par with Constrictor, but it's definitely above average. Every song has at least one redeeming quality about it. I think the ballads are stronger then the rockers, with a couple that are top-notch songs. It appears Chris Cornell contributed to some of the song-writing. The overall sound is very 1994 for a melodic hard rock band, and the overall concept works well.
0679405496|5.0|I wasn't particularly looking forward to reading A Passage to India.  Forster, in my mind, seemed to suggest implausible romance, pretty scenery, and Helena Bonham Carter, and I'd never actually bothered to read one of his books.<BR> Now I can hardly wait to read another.  I absolutely loved this book, without quite knowing why it was so magical.  I do know that I found the first chapter absolutely perfect, as it allows the reader to go into a &quot;descriptive section&quot; daze, and then jerks are attention suddenly back to the Marabar caves.  And with the exception of one or two patches that dragged a little but were soon over, I found the rest of the book equally magnetic. <BR> I enjoyed Fortster's deftness in portraying all the characters, not so much as individuals, but in terms of how they felt about each other.  In particular I loved the relationship between Fielding and Aziz, while understanding completely the dislike each had for aspects of the others character.<BR>The ending is marvelous.  So often books that hold your interest like this just peter out, but it's refreshing to find an author like Forster who understands that what makes for an ideal conclusion is to give the readers a taste of what they want, and then hold back the last little bit.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I was first in line to see this movie the day it came out, and I saw it multiple times after.  It was great!!  This movie rates #1 on my list along with \\"The Sorceror's Stone\\" and the Lord of the Rings movies!
B00005QK39|3.0|This is the re-mastered edition of &quot;The Script for a Jesters<br />Tears&quot;.  I purchased this CD because I lost my original one<br />in a house-fire.  Unfortunately, the &quot;alternate versions&quot; of<br />the Tracks offered are rather disappointing and fall short of<br />the true 'Heavy Metal' style which characterised the original<br />release.<br />I especially am disapointed with &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; (both<br />versions on this disc) which takes out the feeling Fish had put<br />in the original release.  If you can find it, get the original<br />CD and not the new remaster one.  The Tracks on the FIRST CD are<br />all the original ones. But the ones on the SECOND CD are rather<br />disapointing. It would be better to buy &quot;B-Sides Themselves&quot; for<br />the original tracks on the second CD. ( If this review has helped you please click on the button!)
B00008K78M|5.0|Laura Pausini is really talented, if you are not a fan, you'll become one. This DVD is so great, I was surprised!  most of it is in italian but has 4 songs in spanish, it also has good extra features and some videos (italian and spanish speaking). Doesn't matter if you don't speak those languages you will be just CAUTIVATED, I assure you. The DVD is region free and was made in Germany. A must see. The concert is in dts and I just can say: Great Laura! We're waiting for another great quality dvd. A video collection would be fantastic. This dvd is essential for any one who enjoy the home theater at it best and admire great singers. Buy it you won't be dissaponted.
B000066I6N|5.0|The man does not disappoint!<br />After a superband like Zeppelin breaks up, it's always a scramble to see which of the former (surviving) members will do well on their own. In the case of Zeppelin, of course, it was all of them. This is because each individual brought to the band not only his immense musical gifts, but also a vast range of musical interests, and an attitude of openness and experimentation. The result: 24 years after John Bonham's tragic passing, Jimmy Page continues to burn down the house, John Paul Jones --- a gifted producer as well as musician and songwriter --- expands his range over rock and acid jazz to the bleeding edge of his work with Diamanda Galas. And Robert Plant brings us Dreamland. And it is exquisite.<br />The overall sound is gentle and psychedelic. Plant's gorgeous, languid voice continues to delight, yet does not overpower the contributions of the brilliant cast of assembled musicians. The songs may be covers, but Plant's arrangements make them his own. Although Plant's distinctive voice is unmistakable, this is not a sequel to Led Zeppelin III. If you enjoyed III, the overall sound of Dreamland will tickle you, but make no mistake, Dreamland is not a look back. It's evolution in motion. Give yourself a treat, and buy this album now.<br />The quest to transcend one's earlier successes can lead an artist into several traps, including ear-tormenting repetition (Stones) and sad attempts to cash in on current flash-in-the-pan trends (Aerosmith). The difficult path is one of continuous discovery and innovation. And this is the path that Plant has chosen. <br />Thanks, Percy.
0446310786|3.0|Harper Lee is a great writer. This book is about how people can be prejudice against other people and how that affects some other people. I htink that this book would be boring to most people, but if you are really in to god books with a message hidden behind it, you should read this book.
B000005JA8|1.0|Sorry, Beefheart fans.  You're not musically [dumb] if you don't like this, YOU JUST HAVE DIFFERENT TASTE.  The smugness of the 5-star reviews is pretty telling.  \\"We're better than other people because we like this crazy music.\\"  Right.  <br />I hate this album with a passion, and you'll find nary a major-label or bubble-gum pop album in my collection.  In general, you either love it or you hate it, but loving it doesn't necessarily make you a Mensa member... this album is different and interesting, but simply not for everybody...  I think that this was interesting and novel, but not at all a listenable, valuable album - and the sanctimonious fans make it even more unattractive.  <br />Give it up.
0792833260|4.0|1988's Rain Man is the story of a young, greedily ambitious car dealer, Charlie Babbitt, who travels from Los Angeles to Cincinnati after his father passes away.  Expecting to be left his father's millions, he finds he is only left with some rose bushes and a classic Buick convertible.  Even more shocking to Charlie is that he finds out the millions have been left to a brother he never knew he had.  His brother, Raymond, is much older and confined to an institution because he is afflicted with autism.  Charlie takes Raymond out of the institution and wants to take him back to L.A. in order to bilk him out of the money.  After Raymond refuses to fly, they set off on a cross-country journey in the Buick.  Initially, Charlie is uncaring and unsympathetic to Raymond.  Raymond is a creature of routine and any deviation from it causes him to become worried and troubled.  Eventually, Charlie softens up and grows to care for his brother and gives in to his routines, but also helps Raymond break some of them.  Dustin Hoffman won his second Best Actor Oscar for his role as Raymond and Tom Cruise gave his first serious and critically acclaimed performance as Charlie.  The film won three other Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for Barry Levinson and Best Original Screenplay for writers Ronald Bass &amp; Barry Morrow. The film can get a little tedious and cloying spots and while Mr. Hoffman's performance is clearly genuine and heart felt, but he sometimes falls into an almost cartoon character with his mannerisms.  That being said, Rain Man is a highly entertaining film that will make you laugh and cry.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I gotta say it up front so you know what you're in for if you're reading this. I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! From the opening scene to the ending one, this was one heck of a lot of fun. Catherine Zeta-Jones WAS Velma. One reviewer said she was born to play this role. The reviewer was right. Who knew she could sing like that and move like that? She lit up the screen. I don't know anything about rap music, so all I knew of Queen Latifah was her name. She was the PERFECT Mama. John C. Reilly just broke my heart with his performance and his show stopper - Mr. Cellophane. He was outstanding. And who knew Richard Gere had that kind of performance in him? Sure he can play suave and cool and you can picture him slithering in under the door. But singing and tap dancing too? He looked like he was having fun, and I had fun watching him. I was prepared for Renee Zellweger to be good. After all, she pulled off Bridget Jones, right? There aren't enough superlatives to describe her performance as Roxie Hart. She not only twisted her husband around her little finger; she did a darn good job of doing the same thing to me.<br />The story line of Chicago may be cynical, and the characters may all represent the shadier side of life. But those kinds of characters do exist. And in this day and age when the media makes a circus out of everything from a child falling down a well to war in a foreign country, it's no stretch to accept that atmosphere in a scenario where a woman kills her lover. There's a case on the front page of newspapers right now that parallels Chicago's story. Still, in spite of all the Razzle Dazzle and the fun, there was still the poignancy of women whose futures were all determined by one mad moment of passion.<br />So, in case I haven't been clear, the cast of this movie was outstanding. So was the music. So were the costumes. I'm still humming \\"He Had It Coming\\". This movie did exactly what it promised to do. It entertained me, and when it was over, I wanted to sit right back down and watch it again. The only thing wrong with the 13 Oscar Nominations it got is that not all the nominees can win because some are competing against each other. If you want to see a movie during which you will catch yourself smiling and tapping your foot and losing all sense of time ---- go see Chicago. You won't be sorry.ack down and watch it again. The only thing wrong with the 13 Oscar Nominations it got is that not all the nominees can win because some are competing against each other.

B00005JLRR|1.0|I'm suprised to see such a high average rating for this movie. I saw it opening night, like I've see every TNG Star Trek film.<br />I have no bad things to say about the subject matter, or the concepts. Even the fact that this is the last mission on the ship for several characters, for different reasons, did not bother me.<br />The problem, for me, was the execution.<br />A machine gun fight with racing dune buggies?<BR>A StarWarsEsqe corridor Blaster Battle?<BR>A HuntForRedOctoberEsque metal catwalk chase scene?<br />This is not Star Trek, folks. This is a desperate studio hiring a \\"non-Star Trek\\" director to try and make this more \\"accessible\\" to non-fans. But you see, the non-fans don't go to see Star Trek. And the fans that went, well, didn't get to see it either.<br />The ending... like I said, I had no problem with the concept of the ending. But they didn't do it right. They didn't give any sense of completion, or reality. They kept you waiting for a miracle until the last second, and then left saying \\"We weren't teasing this time, sorry,\\" and you're left going \\"Whhhhhaaaat? That was real? That really happened? That's the end?\\"<br />Ugh.<br />They say there's almost an hour of cut footage that may hit the DVD when it comes out. Hopefully that'll fix some of these problems. But even so, even though I will definately buy it (that's what collectors DO) I doubt I will watch it any more than I watch the Motion Picture (once every couple years) or even less.<br />What a horrible, worthless end to a fabulous ship and crew.
B00006CXSS|5.0|There really is nothing else to say.  History told like it should be.  A an absolute gem of a movie.  I have watched it 10+ times and no one should miss this epic.
B000058983|5.0|I have owned this cd for a year now. I originally bought it because of all that I read on this site, certainly some conflicting opinions. I am 52 and I had never heard of Arthur Lee and Love but I have been buying many cds from the sixties that I loved on vinyl and I decided to purchase this. At first I thought it was a typical west coast flower power trippy album but after numerous listens this cd is very good and much more. I can well understand the influence it had on artists of the day. Trippy folk rock yes, but a very enjoyable album and one that if you are into this genre it is an essential and highly recommended.
B00008973A|1.0|As a Former cast memeber of the Frist National Company of A Chorus Line, I can truly say that this is Absolute trash.  Horrible choreography, direction, casting! Go see a touring production of the real thing.
1577311523|5.0|\\"The Power of Now\\" is a wonderful book which puts you in control of our life by focusing on the present moment. Although there is little new in this book, the way Tolle emphasizes the power of the present moment is compelling. In addition, I absolutely recommend Dr. Rosalene Glickman's \\"Optimal Thinking - How to Be Your Best Self\\" (Wiley 2002). Glickman shows you how to accept what is out of your control (like the past, the weather, etc) and maximize the present moment with simple questions like \\"What's the best thing I can do under the circumstances?\\" She provides the ultimate, practical roadmap to deal with all disturbing emotions.  If you read both of these books, you will not only have control of your life, but all the nuts and bolts to optimize any situation.
B000088E6D|5.0|Who Is THAT??? My head turned when I heard this voice, Who is he? All right Foster, you've done it AGAIN. This guy has a penchant for finding the best of the best and he's scored once more with Michael Buble'! This guy swings so high you think you might never come down, as for me, I didn't WANT TO! Great presence, phrasing is perfection, pitch, there's nothing this young man lacks. As a professional Jazz vocalist (A Working One!)I am smitten with this wonderful new talent. Mr. Foster, I MUST thank you for bringing us yet another genious that makes my ears smile!
B00006RIO7|4.0|John Kander and Fred Ebb's famed Chicago musical numbers gets a rejuvenation with the direction by Rob Marshall along with his talented and passionate ensemble. The soundtrack has a lush fusion of cabaret jazz, bossa nova and blues to move the dark tale of seduction and celebrity and the revelation turns out to be rapper Queen Latifah in her brilliant rendition of &quot;When You're Good to Mama&quot; with pomp and sass. Zeta-Jones acquits herself well as the prima-donna Velma in the musical sequences like &quot;And all that jazz&quot; and &quot;Cell black Tango&quot; while Zellweger dazzles as Roxie with the enthusiastic Richard Gere as Flynn in &quot;We Both Reached for the Gun&quot;. Though off-film numbers like the hip-hop version of Cell Black Tango and Anastacia's Love is a crime stymies the flow, listeners are rewarded with the zippy &quot;Class&quot; and Danny Elfman's infectious scores. All-in-all, an energetic display of razzle-dazzle that sets our toes tapping.
B00005RHGK|3.0|this film had a great intro, a lot better than most of those final destination type movies with all the pretty faces, kind of like dawson's creek.  now, i know i'm very damn good looking, but not everyone is, especially in america, where most of the population is overweight.  all the women in these films are very attractive and even the men are very attractive (hell some of them are prettier than the women.<br />great intro that was influenced by classics such as texas chainsaw and duel, but it seemed to have no middle.  it jumped into the action with the mysterious person being a demon from another world, eating people for certain parts of their anatomy, i.e. tongue, eyes, libia, etc. and the end was just cheesy with the demon in his little basement sewing bodies while you see the college boy's face with his eyes cut out, so the demon wins in the end.
B000084T18|5.0|...5 stars for sure.  There is no BAD song on this CD.  \\"In Da Club\\" is the standout track of the CD but that doesn't mean the rest is garbage.  Eminem knows what he's doing...<br />1.Intro-only 6 sec long, nothin big<BR>2.What Up Gangsta-Perhaps one of the strongest tracks on here.  Up-beat, good instrumentally and lyrically.<BR>3.Patiently Waiting-Features Eminem, definitely a good colabo, similar rhythem as LOSE YOURSELF...good song<BR>4.Many Men-Good Song but not one of my favorites, there are too many good 1s better than this 1<BR>5.In Da Club-The 2nd single dropped every1 knows it!  Dre is a producing GENIUS.<BR>6.High All The Time-Guess what this 1s about, good beat and a fav of mine.<BR>7.Heat-The only thing ANNOYING about this 1 is the sound of the cocking of the gun in the backround, THROUGH THE WHOLE SONG!  You get over though.<BR>8.If I Can't-Says if he can't do it, than it can't be done.  Great instrumentally and good chorus.<BR>9.Blood Hound-ONE OF THE BEST  I like this one a lot.  Chorus is tight.<BR>10.Back Down-JA RULE DISS.  He gets him pretty good on this.  50 claims he never backs down from any challenge...great battle track.<BR>11.PIMP-Kinda a different vibe instrumentally...okay song though<BR>12.Like My Style-GREAT SONG...Proves G-UNIT is UP and COMING<BR>13.Poor Lil Rich-I like this one...don't know what to say.<BR>14.21 Questions-Unbelieveable track features Nate Dogg.  Slowed beat but great lyrically.<BR>15.Don't Push Me-Features Em in this one and ONE OF MY FAVs.  This one's on repeat...<BR>16.Gotta Make It to Heaven- \\"I Gotta Make it to heaven, I'm goin thru Hell\\"  Phat song...<BR>17.Wanksta-1st single every1 knows it...<BR>18.U Not Like Me-Not too bad but not one of my favorites<BR>19.Life's On the Line-My LEAST Favorite...just because of how it starts out...<BR>...OVERALL, this is one of few CDs I can put in the changer without skippin any tracks.  50 is tha future and Em made a  smart move. THE BEST PART is that EVERY song on here is AMAZING instrumentally (bein produced by Dre & Em) Also, 50 didn't have to use a ton of guest appearances like some we all know (Master P, Diddy, Cash Money, JERMAINE DUPRI especially...etc) and 50 still manages to make a CLASSIC ALBUM.  Go cop dis album...You'll be sorry if you don't.  Get this ALBUM OR DIE TRYIN'...
B0000640VO|5.0|I thought the movie was absolutely wonderful. Sexy, adventurous, funny. Caught my every moment. I didn't move from my spot when I watched it. Amelie is a perfect funfilled movie.
6305313687|5.0|I think this movie is great. Not only it is a great film with exciting moments and unforgettable feelings, but it also gives a very interesting point of view over the problem of racism. <BR>I loved it.<BR>so watch it!
B00006L9ZT|5.0|According to the liner notes that accompany this seven-DVD set of Wagner's &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen,&quot; the composer had no time for critics, especially those who liked to point out a certain lack of logic in his musical dramas.<br />(Take that, Anna Russell! - Entire careers have been based on making fun of the Ring Cycle's plot.)<br />This Met version of the Ring under the direction of James Levine might be called 'traditional' by some and 'stodgy' by others.  There are no Siegfrieds in space suits or Rhine Maidens cavorting in front of a hydroelectric dam.  Special effects have been kept to a minimum--a rather tame dragon (although wonderfully sung by Matti Salminen who also is a great, brooding hulk of a Hagen), no goat-drawn chariots, no flying horses.  In fact there are no horses at all, which makes for a slightly surreal funeral scene in 'G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung' where Br&uuml;nnhilde is supposed to sing to her horse, Grane, then ride him into the flames of Siegfried's funeral pyre.<br />However, the Ring isn't about special effects or acting.  It's about Wagner's glorious music.  I've only seen one other Ring Cycle--Patrice Ch&eacute;reau's 1976 Bayreuth production (also out on DVD)--and he (incorrectly, I think) emphasized the stage drama rather than the music.  He also ignored Wagner's mythical setting and tried to turn the Ring into a statement about nineteenth-century robber-barons.<br />Levine's version, stodgy though it may appear, emphasizes the music.  This is the Ring Cycle you want to start with.  It reflects the spirit of Wagner's intentions (if not quite the actual staging), and the singing is excellent.  This is not the dream cast from the golden age of Wagnerian singers, but wait till you hear Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, ringing out her &quot;Oh hehrstes Wunder!&quot; just after her whole world comes crashing down around her.  If this unearthly cry doesn't send chills down your spine, maybe Wagner isn't for you.  One of the other reviewers felt that Norman was too loud for the other singers, but I think just the opposite is true.  James Morris is a complex, ultimately tragic Wotan.  Hildegard Behrens is a brilliant, intuitive Br&uuml;nnhilde. Their final scene together in 'Die W&auml;lk&uuml;re,' as Wotan puts his daughter to sleep within a ring of fire is one of the high points of this Ring.  But the one truly Wagnerian voice in this production belongs to Jessye Norman.<br />If you'd like to learn more about Wagner's Ring Cycle, read &quot;Wagner's Ring:  Turning the Sky Round&quot; by Father M. Owen Lee (highly recommended) or Charles Osborne's &quot;The World Theatre of Wagner.&quot;orman was too loud for the other singers, but I think just the opposite is true.  James Morris is a complex, ultimately tragic Wotan.  Hildegard Behrens is a brilliant, intuitive Brünnhilde. Their final scene together in 'Die Wälküre,' as Wotan puts his daughter to sleep within a ring of fire is one of the high points of this Ring.

020530902X|5.0|I have a couple of other reviews somewhere in this batch but its been a long time since I wrote them. I just want to say that &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; is still the one in my book.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|The lyrics are heart felt, the melodies are provacative, and over all the very image the two artist of TATU project is an embodiment of what girls of this time are about. The whole cookie cutter look brought on by pop stars Brittany Spears and Mandy More has had its time. Tatu is the new breed of girl icons that stray from the conservative lyrics,innocent visage,... and orthodox sexual preferance.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem has for sure topped himself again. After listening to how great the Marshall Mathers LP was, and with all the popularity it was geting, I didn't think he could top himself. But he proved me wrong, The Eminem Show is his greatest work. There isn't a song on that cd that is bad, although my top six have to be: Superman, Till I Collapse (f/ Nate Dogg), Sing for the moment, Cleaning Out My Closet, Soldier, & Halie's Song. I say those are my favorites, but they are all great songs. As usual Eminem keeps it real with his cocky 1st single like the Slim Shady's LP \\"My Name Is,\\" and Marshall Mathers LP \\"The Real Slim Shady.\\" But on this record he out does himself with \\"Without me,\\" taking stabs at NSYNC (as normal) & Moby (Thankgod!). This album is awesome and I highly reccomend it to any rap music fan.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I first bought this album in Moscow in 2001, when the album was first released.  It became a instant hit in Russia, and I loved the album.  According to the Russian press, they are not real lesbians, but that does not interfere with the album's popularity at all, in fact it only makes it that much more interesting.  THe English lyrics have been altered somewhat, the Russian title to  &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; is, translated, &quot;I've Lost My Mind&quot; (Ya Soshla s Uma).<BR>THe same points are made however.  THe musik is upbeat and fun, and a great listen.<BR>If you liked this album, and are interested in Russian music, some other Russian artists are Strelki, Ruki Vverkh, Linda, Zemfira, and Alsou (whose album is also available in English)  I can only hope that some of these artists make it here also.
B00005KHJR|4.0|This film was exceptionally good as both a horror film (which it is, but in a cerebral way) and as a good mystery (which it also is).  There's some nudity in the film which doesn't contribute to the story but seems to just be there to provide lewd entertainment value.  Aside from that, it's a magnificent film and well worth the cost of the DVD.
6301966562|5.0|This is an excellent, light romantic comedy and Virginia Madsen's second movie (the first being \\"Class\\" in 1983).  It is loosely based on an idea (unacknowledged in the credits) first developed by Kurt Vonnegut in a short story called \\"EPICAC.\\"<br />The story concerns an introverted young architect named Miles, who accidentally imbues his PC with artificial intelligence by downloading an enormous amount of data into it and subsequently spilling champaigne on the motherboard (okay, stop groaning, it's a comic fantasy).  Miles is on his way to befriending his serendipitously made acquaintance when he meets his pretty neighbor Madeline (Madsen), the cellist, who lives upstairs.<br />Unfortunately for Miles, while he is working up the courage to pursue Madeline, Edgar, the computer, has heard her playing music and has also become smitten with her, and the sparks begin to fly in an all's-fair-in-love-and-war, every man/machine for himself/itself classic romatic triangle with a twist.<br />This is a very funny movie which taps tentatively into the larger question of what makes us human.  It's one of those overlooked classics of light entertainment.  After seeing 62 other reviews of this movie here, I begin to wonder what the rights holders are thinking -- 80$?, NO DVD? What's wrong with you people -- are you allergic to money?  Wake up and smell the greenbacks!  Get this thing on DVD, and for a reasonable price and I'm sure that lots of people will snap it up!...
B00000F169|1.0|My God, this movie must be the most boring thing I've seen since My Dinner with Andre.  I wanted to like it...I tried to like it...but I guess I'm just one of the ones who \\"didn't get it\\".  I'm not certain that's such a bad thing.  I understood the premise and the plot, but I didn't crack a smile during the entire film, and I spent half the time looking at my watch in disbelief at how slow time can seem to pass.  One word: monotonous!  I now use my Dark Star DVD as an \\"avant garde\\" coaster for my coffee mug at work.  R.I.P.
B00007BH3Y|4.0|I just watched this movie, and I really loved it. I loved the score too. I thought it sounded like the &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; score. So if you liked that one, then I think you'll like this one. Anyone else agree?
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movies is probably one of my best memories from the eighties, (other than legging's. I really miss them.) Pretty much the entire cast is made up of stars you'd recognise today, -Matthew Broderick, Charlie Sheen, Alan Ruck(Spin City), Jennifer Grey(Dirty Dancing),Ben Stine(He does that boring professor on Visine commercials).<BR>     Ferris Bueller is a popular high school kid who decides to play hooky and has a memorable day of it. The events that occur and the things he gets away with during this day are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and will definately make any one smile. This film is a classic that you'll want to own to play at parties or dull nights in the dorm. Even if you didn't remember the eighties or hated them, I'm sure you'll at least appreciate this product from that decade.
0446677450|5.0|There are a few reviews in here that have some negative commentary about the book... Saying that it is common sense to know the things Kiyosaki talks about in his book. Well, the point of the book is for people who were not taught the common sense of financial intelligence, which is pretty much everyone that doesn't have wealthy parents or was afforded the opportunity to go to an elite business school. This book is for people who need to know the basics and understand how to apply them to their life. If you are a Harvard or Wharton Business School Graduate this is not the book for you. If you are in debt, want to learn how to grow your assets and want to learn how to be financially free when you retire this book is a great place to start!
B0000640VO|5.0|Although I love watching foreign movies and this one came highly recommended, I was reluctant to watch this one as I usually hate comedy/romance movies. But after the first few minutes of the film, I was already in love; this film is so vastly different from other movies from the same category -it's smart and witty.<BR>     What makes it different is the point of view from the main character, Amelie. Being that she is a timid girl with an enormous imagination, the story tastefully draws off her charming creativity and how she uses it to meddle in the lives of those around her. And as any charming movie does, what goes around comes around.<BR>     The acting is superb, the story is clever, and the filmwork is masterful. Even an illiterate person would have fun watching this film. I think maybe the best word to discribe this movie is classic. I can't think of another film that better fits the criteria of what a classic film should be.
0812550706|3.0|if you are older than a teenager you will find the direction of the story pretty obvious. Children are the main characters and adults are to be \\"mistrusted.\\" The aliens are a back-story to the \\"drama\\" of kids working togther as team. Card really needs to tackle deeper topics before he can be taken seriously. He compares himself to Asimov in the new introduction which leaves me speechless.<br />I cannot believe the number of 5 star reviews this novel gets -- please read Neuromancer instead if you are looking for speculative insights about the near-future. Or maybe Snow Crash, but avoid this silly novel about kids who learn how to be \\"team-players\\"
0316666343|5.0|For a book with such a morbid begining, it was great. I couldn't stop reading. It makes you think about how heaven really is and what happens after you die. It was such an exciting book for being so short.
B000002H6C|5.0|Given that this album is 15 years old, I can assume that nearly everyone has already heard it, but for those contemplating getting started with Metallica, ignore anything 1990 and forward. Beginning in 1983, Metallica began moving toward metal history with each step from 'Kill 'em All' through 'Master of Puppets', but 'Justice' was their true prize. This is an epic album for the sophisticated listener.  The lyrics are as good as anything Jaymz has ever done, and the Larz' drums are better than anything he will ever do again (considering his downfall beginning with the black album). Metallica was once my favorite band simply because of 'Justice'.  Their recent garbage has distorted their image - the reigns of supremacy handed over to TOOL - but Justice will never die and will be remembered forever on as perhaps the most incredible album ever conceived.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|as a fellow crazy person i often scowl and stomp about the way that mentaly ill are portrayed. either they are overly sympathetic, or monsterous, or too one sided. but in donnie darko, its the first time ive never yelled SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP at the tv. they nailed it, and everything was done in such a haunting mannor. it was really touching.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I will confess the first fifth of the film is a little bit slow.  After that, run for your life.  It's a blaze of medieval battle, twisted emotions, mythical creatures, magical powers, gorgeous landscapes, and massive strongholds.  This being second in the trilogy, I think we were all worried it wouldn't be as good as the first: It's better!  This one has dragons and probably almost an hour and a half of straight battle.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is my fave cd of all time. The songs speak truths and send messages that need to be heard. The sound of the songs makes you want to sing and dance and shout. I hink everyone can relate to these songs in their own way. Check it out.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|i saw this movie a week ago. The movie's really just about a guy who's selfish and charmless, and has no feelings for kids. He is 38 living a pretty cool life not having to do any work since his rich, and he has never had a relationship lasting over 2 month. One day he finds a sign in a shopping center saying single parents night. He decides to go there. All the people there have children and they are looking for a guy with a kid, so ofcourse he lies and says he has a kid, and he ended up gettin a partener. Not long he and his partener decided to go on a stroll down the park so they did, and the lady brand her baby and her friends son on a walk since her friend was in a bad condition. The boy was feeding the fish and he than threw the whole bred on a duck and actually killed it so they went back home. As they went back to drop off the boy they saw his mum unconsioused from trying to kill herself so they got an ambulance and went to hospital. Not long after the boy starts to becomes friends the selfish guy and the guy actually has feelings for the poor boy and buys him some fashionable stuff like that he won't get bullied. Theres more to the movie but i don't want to rewn it in case you want to see it. Any way overall this was a good film with a fair bit of comedy but it had some boring bits. Any way a fair acting from hugh grant who i don't personally like as an actor but this film he did good. If you like romance you would may aswell watch it and if your a fan of hugh grant then RENT IT!!! BUY IT!!! Any well just to make it more simple heres a rating out of ten for the story, comedy, romance etc.<br />story plot:8(great story)     comedy:5(had some funny bits)     action:0     romance:7(pretty romantic)    sadness:8(sad yes)<br />To be honest i really recomend this movie for little kids and older people, its stupid they rate it M15 because so it had the theme where the boys mum tried to kill herself but the romance and the ending makes up for it oh well any way myopinion good movie!!! and if you have kids go rent it!!!should be PG!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I got this CD for the sole purpose of &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; however, I quickly learned that her music is the most passionate music I have heard in a long time.  Most people my age are used to listening to people screaming at them and not being able to understand all the words. But Ms. Jones teaches us the finer things of life and music with her CD.  I wish there was another one coming out soon, but for now...I will play this CD until it wears out.  My suggestion is to buy this CD for yourself and definitely as a gift for someone you love...they will thank you for it!
B00004Z459|5.0|I was expecting an extremely angry experience with this album. And in many ways I got it, but the rap aspect of it really surprised me. With the trite-ness of Limp Bizkit, Korn, and a handful of other Metal-Rap bands, I wasn't expecting much. <br />(01) Papercut - With coool guitars to start this track out joined by the rapper (not clear on the names) who has a very decent flow to his music, this is a GOOD song. The rhymes are pretty good throughout as well. {5}<br />(02) One Step Closer - You all know this song don't you? I LOVE this song. It has a good guitar riff with a pretty decent set of lyrics. The first half of the song is somewhat... \\"Generation X Noise\\" but at the halfway point when he starts screaming \\"SHUTUP!\\" it's very intense and easy to spaz out to. {4}<br />(03) With You - The rapper starts out this song kinda slow, then it picks up with another good riff on the guitars, and the other singer still has a good scream throughout this song. I love the dub on their voices, too. {4}<br />(04) Points Of Authority - The rapper starts out this song kinda dumb-ly with an awkward rhyme, but the loud singer has a good melodic part while screaming throughout as well. {3}<br />(05) Crawling - The song starts with a loud explosion of guitars with the other singer yelling, and then it slows down so he can sing some soft, melodic verses, before the rapper jumps in with a quick line or two (he seems to have a back seat on this song), before the guitars explode again. The other singer screams, and then it slows down again for some truly beautiful singing. Impressive. {5}<br />(06) Runaway - Another good melodic part by singer #2 and the rapper has a back seat on this song as well. The melody is carried through until the 2 minute mark, where he just starts yelling, with an explosively angry part. {5}<br />(07) By Myself - The rapper takes the forefront on this track with some mediocre rapping, although it progressively gets better over the course of the track. The second singer really knows what he's doing here. He holds the melody together through the mid-Loud parts and joins the noise of the guitars through the LOUD parts with a tortured scream. {4}<br />(08) In The End - The second singer has a really great voice, he starts this track out with a quiet, melody, and gradually progresses a little bit louder (he never really screams in this song, and he still sounds awesome!), and he still has a great melody. The rapper has a really good flow in this song. The dub on the rappers voice is awesome too. One of my favorite tracks on the album. {5}<br />(09) A Place For My Head - This song starts out with the rapper doing a great job! The chorus is kinda awkward. The rapper has SKILLZ! He compares with Eminem's speed in this song. And then it gets loud with the second singer going crazy. Good song. {4}<br />(10) Forgotten - Uh oh. Limp Bizkit flashback. Fortunately, the song gets somewhat better. The rapper does an overall good job in this song, despite sounding like Fred (retch!). It's an ok song. {3}<br />(11) Cure For The Itch - Hm. This song starts wierd, with a wierd sample, and some other wierd samples. The instrumental part is very, very cool though. (It reminds me a lil bit of Aphex Twin.) {4}<br />(12) Pushing Me Away - The second singer has a good melodic part of this song. He really has a great voice. The lyrics are surprisingly well written as well. The rapper has a back seat on this one again, but when he is there, he does a pretty good job. {5}<br />This is a great CD. If you like loud stuff, or if you like melodic stuff and can tolerate loud stuff, you should definitely get this CD. NOW.
0790733900|5.0|This 1967 film begins when Paul Newman, cast as Luke Jackson, is arrested for cutting the tops off parking meters and sent to a southern chain gang prison for a two-year sentence.  Life is harsh for the men who must toil in the sun building roads each day.  But Luke is cool, very cool.  Soon he gains the respect of his fellow prisoners and becomes a leader himself.  He rebels constantly.  Nothing can stop him, not even a double set of chains on his legs. He's the lovable maverick that we all admire.<br />Performances are excellent, especially that of George Kennedy, cast as Luke's buddy.  A youthful Dennis Hopper has a small part also.  Best of all though is the one scene with Jo Van Fleet, cast as Luke's mother, who comes to visit him in prison.  She's clearly dying and is lying in the back of a truck, unable to walk.  She smokes cigarettes constantly and is full of wisdom and grit and gumption.  She talks about how she just can't be like a female dog who don't recognize her pups after they've grown and tells Luke that his old man wasn't much for sticking around but he sure did make her laugh.  She laughs then and gets into a fit of coughing.  Newman does his usual fine job in a challenging part that has him break down at times but yet never lets him lose his sprit.<br />The reason for Luke's rebellion was always a little murky and that was the strength of the screenplay. He never did anything really wrong; he just confronted authority.  And every time he ran away, he kept getting caught.  It also seemed that life on the outside wasn't so great for him and he yearned for the camaraderie of his fellow prisoners, who, by the way were all white as this film takes place in the segregated south.  Sometime, though, the prison seemed more like an army barracks.  There was always plenty of food and they didn't have to work on Sunday.  The men played cards and had some slight recreational activity.  For example, at one point they all took bets on whether or not Luke would be able to eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in the period of one hour.  Guess who won?<br />The story held my interest even though there were no real surprises.  Sometimes though I thought that the actors cast as members of the chain gang were just a little too handsome and well muscled to be a typical cross-section of prisoners, but - after all, this is Hollywood.  However, it's a good film, with good performances.  And I definitely recommend it.be able to eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in the period of one hour.

B00005JK8K|2.0|The story behind this film is intriguing -- Navajo Indians were used as codetalkers in World War II; the Japanese never cracked the code.  That's about the extent of what I learned about the Navajo codetalkers in this film.  This was a gory, shoot-em-up war film, with plenty of Japs (conveniently identifiable by the twigs in their helmets) tumbling to the ground under American fire, lots of arms & legs being blown off, even a decapitation.  The rumble of gunfire serves as background noise at all times.  The Nicholas Cage character is meant to be an enigma -- he is neither particularly interesting nor particularly likeable,and his transformation (from skepticism of his Navajo assignee to respect for the Navajo) seems a bit too sudden.  There are some breathtaking shots of Navajo country at the end of the film, but it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film to see.  If you want a war movie, you won't necessarily be disappointed.  If you want a history lesson, don't spend your money on this.
B00005O5CM|5.0|this is a very very great movie!! Reese did a wonderfull job..as so she did in \\"Freeway\\" i think everyone should see this movie.It reps where i'm from Cali and its funny as hell.This is a movie to get togather with friends and watch .Reese deserves awards for this movie...great job!
0783226063|1.0|David Lynch killed the mystical world that Frank Herbert created.  It diverts so much from the wonderfull book, that most of the plot is lost, and the rest is a botched attempt.  So many things are left out that are key elements to characterization, that if you havent read the book, you have only a shallow idea of what is going on.  But if you have read the book and then watch this, then you are disgusted.  The sci-fi remake is well worth your money, and sticks to the book for the most part, making it a worthy version of Frank Herberts epic.
B000088E6D|5.0|Watch Michael Buble stay at #1, not just because of his stellar Valentine's debut on TODAY. It's a once in a lifetime when a crooner serves up a feast with such originality, when the ingredients include a dab of Sinatra, a shaker of Chet Baker, a sprinkle of Torme, Feinstein and Harry Connick, Jr., with just a little bit added for good measure of Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall. What a joy that Michael Buble has arrived!
B0000640VO|5.0|I was one of those close-minded types who was put off from seeing this movie, as I kept hearing what a great date movie it is. I tend to equate the words &quot;date movie&quot; with &quot;chick flick.&quot; This film will hopefully help me resolve these personal issues.<br /><br />  &quot;Amelie&quot; was my introduction to Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Having now seen this film as well City of Lost Children, I can only say that I hold him in only slightly less regard than God. &quot;Creative Genius&quot; is a term all too bandied about in reviewland, yet it applies in this instance. I can't say that Amelie &quot;changed my life,&quot; but it definitely gave me a fresh perspective.<br />  One of the characteristics I've noticed in the two Jeunet films I've watched, involves his use of interconnecting threads in an otherwise juxtaposed or fractured story line. This is not exactly a unique technique in recent cinema. Paul Thomas Anderson used it quite effectively in &quot;Magnolia.&quot; Likewise David Lynch in &quot;Mullholand Drive,&quot; for just two examples. Jeunet surpasses all of them, however, in terms of playfulness and sheer directorial instinct. It owes also to a sensibility in French cinema that hearkens back most directly to the Jaques Tati era.<br />  The artistic marriage of such an artfully clever director with an actress (Audrey Tautou) seemingly born to play a role can best be chalked up to kismet, synchroneity, harmonic convergence, whatever. I'm just glad they got together, for they make for an irresistable combo.<br />  Highest marks for camera work, script, direction, acting, DVD transfer. This is the whole package. Don't let anything put you off from securing this grand-slam of a film. For something &quot;completely different,&quot; also check out &quot;City of Lost Children.&quot; I can't wait for &quot;Delicatessan&quot; to be released to DVD.<br />BEK
B00005JL96|1.0|Who wants to show their kids a movie about a bunch of desperately unhappy people?  Everywhere Lilo turns there are people trying to make her life miserable.  Then comes Stitch from outer space, who is violent and disrespectful, and this is what is supposed to make Lilo feel like she finally \\"belongs?\\" Not only did I greatly dislike the basic plot, I also found the movie to have SO many ridiculous twists and turns it was as if the writers didn't know where to end it. Horrible from beginning to end, to end, to end...
B0000046X0|5.0|When I first got this album, I was expecting the explosive effect of Mahavishnu Orchestra, so at first I was a little disappointed with the more subtle, flowing mood of the album.  Man, I was wrong!  With a few listens, you start to really notice how well Chick Corea wove songs together, Lenny White's drumming pops out of your speakers, and Stanley Clarke's bass...MONSTROUS!  I'm a total bass freak, especially of late Metallica bassist Cliff Burton, so when I heard Stanley electric solo, I flipped out.  Great lines, total domination of his instrument and a powerful, punchy tone really put Stanley a league ahead of others (except maybe Jaco Pastorius, who rules too).  This album is like flying through clouds--its never too heavy, sometimes it goes fast, other times, it gets light and airy, but its constantly changing.  I've GOT to check out more of their stuff!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|First things first.  Ignore the one-star reviewer that indicts this movie as a \\"cookie cutter\\" and \\"the bastard child of Fight Club and Good Will Hunting.\\"...  However, the reviewers that explain that the movie isn't one-hundred percent accurrate are correct...but who cares?<br />This was the BEST movie of last year.  It is a step up from the slapstick lowest-common denominator trash that Hollywood ordinarily proliferates (it deserves 5 stars for that alone), and at last deals with a valid topic--schizophrenia (I apologize if I misspelled).  At least this movie is on par with Reader's Digest if it is a step away from The New Yorker.<br />To the flaws of the movie... I was dissappointed that the movie didn't show some of Nash's childhood, which would have stood as a foreshadow to the terrors of his later life.  Nash's mental oddity was prevalent in his young years--he tortured furry little animals and tried to electrocute his sister.  I was also bummed that it didn't picture the social issues he had as a youth in his boarding schools which couldn't have been helpful to his volatile temperament.  The movie also should have shown the fact that he had a first wife and a CHILD with her out of wedlock.  They make him seem like some sort of intelligent Forrest Gump.  Finally, they should have pointed out that Alicia divorced him.  They make Alicia look like the paragon of moral guidance and perserverance (she was a good person but they make her look nearly PERFECT).  Even in the DVD special features they have her sitting next to Nash all happy-go-lucky.  Many of the ommissions may have been to avoid exceeding three hours and have the movie labeled an epic.<br />Now the good parts...the movie is ingeniously directed, and many parts of Nash's persona are quite realistic.  It is entertaining, and that's all I really ask for from the degenerate Hollywood anymore.  The acting is superb--especially by Russel Crowe.  The movie actually gives a nice picture of what schizophrenia must be like (however, they ommitted the non-visual aspects like the imaginary phone calls that John heard in his head).<br />Final thought?  The movie deserved Best Picture, even if it isn't perfect, it was the best.  I recommend you research Nash a bit, and read up on Game Theory before you watch it.  I knew John was a schizo coming into the theater so there really wasn't much surprise for me...but you should see the film definitely.
B00005NGSD|3.0|I searced the world over for this album before it was finally rereleased last year.  I've got to say that for all the hype, it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would have been.<br />&quot;In Trance&quot; is my favorite Scorps album, with a wide variety of music going on, and great solos.  With this album, I'd have to say that it could have been a bunch of studio outtakes.  &quot;We'll Burn The Sky&quot; is, however, an excellent song, one of the best the Scorps have ever written, and &quot;Sails of Charon&quot; is interesting too.  At the end of the day, I'd have to say that I was pretty disappointed with this, because I searched for it as if it were the Holy Grail, and it turned out to just be a beer stein instead.
B000088E6D|5.0|It takes a brave man to tackle two songs (Come Fly With Me and Summer Wind) so closely connected with Sinatra, but Buble acquits himself admirably on both tunes, with only minimal &quot;homage&quot; in Come Fly With Me.  Anyway, he owes as much, if not more, to Mel Torme here, and even a tiny bit to Michael Feinstein and Harry Connick.  He does an amazing cover of George Michael's &quot;Kissing A Fool&quot; (his vocals are much better than Michael's, if that can be believed), and probably the most swoony bossa nova version of &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; I've ever heard.  Everybody is touting Peter Cincotti as the New Sinatra, but I think Buble has him beaten.  He's a much better singer, and frankly, cuter.
B000000ZGO|5.0|If James Brown which we all know IS the Godfather of Soul, then Isaac is its' Uncle.  You know, like that uncle we all had that gave us advise when Pops wasn't around, &quot;Boi, listen to yo Uncle now&quot;. But my father always had Isaac playing, I can hear &quot;Cafe Regio&quot; playing now! Good to read some of the reviews from young listeners new to Isaac Hayes.  Wish more would take time to appreciate one of the great pioneers of modern soul.  Like Charlie Parker, Coltrane &amp; Miles who evolutionized Jazz, Isaac took R&amp;B where it never went before and really hasn't gone since.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, he took others songs, and made them his. Like Luther Vandross did.  Ms. Dionne Warwick, who i love and respect as an artist originally recorded many of the songs in question but lacked deep down dirrrty...SOUL! Maybe that's why Whitney Houston was hating on Lauren Hill, and pretending to be the pioneer of today's ladies of Soul(Mary J, Lauren,Jill Scott,etc.) NO Whitney, you lack that deep down Soul, like Dionne that only comes from life's experiences which you've learned all too well by now.  Maybe there's still hope for a Whitney renaissance.   It's not even fair to compare Isaac to any other artist. Isaac's genius is evident throughout all his recordings.  That's the difference between today's artist, where are the musicians?  Is R Kelly, Teddy Riley and a select few that no one can even think of their names the only representation of today's pure original R&amp;B? Man, in the 70's, every group, band or otherwise were musicians. That's why everything was original. Issac is a musical genius, like Quincy Jones, even like my man Prince.  If you listen to &quot;Walk on By&quot; and listen to Dionne's,you're like.....uhhh ok?  If you listen to &quot;By the Time&quot;..and listen to the original.  You're like WHAT THA!? Enough Said! But like Issac said, &quot;everybody has their way of doing,...a thang&quot;, and i'm gonna take it back to Soulsville&quot;.  The Dow has spoken, check out my other Issac reviews on his other Albums. This is one of my favorites.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane by t.A.T.u diserves 5 stars, because these girls are very under~rated and overlooked.  The CD is worth buying.  Not only does it have their awesome hit single -All the Things She said- in this CD but many other great songs.  If you heard and like their song, &quot;All the Things She said&quot; then you will like almost every song on this CD! One of my favorites on the CD is &quot;Not Gonna Get Us.&quot;  A soon as I heard the t.A.T.u single I loved it and the song stood in my head, and I immediatly knew I had to get the 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane CD.  At that time I never heard of them before but the song was just so catchy and good I wanted to hear more of their songs, so I purchased the 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane CD and I don't regret buying it! This CD has become one of my favorites.  The only drawback is the CD is a little short, but it does leave you wanting more and after buying this CD I can't wait to hear the next CD and songs they will make.

B00005RFQ5|3.0|I'm a long time Prince devotee and I've tried and tried to reallylove this album and I just can't.  I appreciate and applaud his daring in doing a jazz themed CD and I genuinely like a few of the tracks, but the all the preaching, convoluted political sttances and anger are off putting.  It doesn't sound like he's having much fun on these recordings.  Another problem is that some songs go on for ages and ages while others are cut short.<br />She Loves Me For Me is a beautiful song, but it's one of teh ones that gets cut before it can fully bloom.  I also like Last December, but it goes on and on and never ends.  The beats of 1+1+1 is 3 are great but they never fully develop.  Are you beginning to see my frustration?<br />There is so much that couldn've madew for an incredible experience but instead, the grooves play second fiddle to the message (if there is one).  Whatever Prince is trying to say is lost on me.  It gets gets burried behind all the posing, proclimations and non-sensical speaches.  And why is he still chanting \\"Free The Slave\\"?  Didn't he get out of his contract with WB?  This is all SO tired.  Whatever hapend to the guy who could get down and funky?  We don't care Prince, we just want you to give us funky... jams again.
B000024D4R|5.0|Well, what can I say? This album is simply one of Floyds best, and possible their most underrated. It's one of their top 3 most essential, along with Wish You Were Here, and Piper At The Gates of Dawn. Please give it a listen. :)
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Over the past few years I've slowly been getting more interested in the Beatles music.  So when this compilation came out I thought what could be a better introductin to them?  Well, I finally got it and I'm very glad I did.<br />I already knew a fair amount of the music before buying it, so I was most interested in hearng the new (for me) songs.  So imagine my surprise when I discovered that all those songs I thought I knew sounded so much more rich than I remembered.  I was captivated by the topics and melodis of Paperback Writer, The Ballad of John and Yoko and Penny Lane and many others.<br />I don't like every song on the CD, but it did it's job in re-inroducing me to old favorites and getting me interested in buying more music.  I'm now in a total Beatles fixation and have bought Sgt. Pepper's with the plan to buy more.  Looks like I'm starting a magical sonic journey!
0789723107|5.0|My situation: I'm a strong OO server-side developer who has suddenly been thrust into the presentation world of web site development.  On all past projects, I've always had specialists on hand to deal with web site design and usability. Now I have to do everything (front-to-back) myself.  I needed resources to get me up to speed quickly.  This book has certainly fits the bill!<br />Lets face it, in today's world where we all have to do more with less (in less time), we don't have time to research all we'd like about web usability.  Per Krug's 3rd law of usability (&quot;Omit (needless) words&quot;), he's done a fantastic job of doing just that with this book.  If you want &quot;the bullet&quot; on good design and usability, this is an exceptional read.  There is very little fluff and lots of tangible &quot;meat&quot; to this book.  <br />I found the chapters on how people use the web and how to write for the web especially useful.  He brings to light many design techniques I've encountered (as a web user), but I never realized the principles on which they were based.  The home page chapter did a great job of highlighting some of the cultural/political challenges assoicated with home page design, as well as the laying out unique design constraints of the home page.  <br />Many technical design books (I've read) do a good job of presenting practical design techniques, but leave it up to the reader to figure out what the underlying design principles are.  This makes it difficult to customize techniques unless you understand the principles.  I walked away with a good understanding of the general principles, as well as some techniques for designing usable web sites.  For me (a top-down kind of learner), this was extremely useful.<br />While this book is not the be-all, end-all solution, its a great jump-start to web design and usability.  It's extremely practical, uses solid real-world examples to illustrate both good and not-so-good designs, and Krug manages to interject some humor throughout.<br />After reading this, you'll never look at web pages the same way again!
B00006AG5N|4.0|I'm not an Elvis fan.  This is the first CD of his that I own.  I don't know what compelled me to be interested in it, but I'm glad I got it.  I've ripped 20 of the included 30 songs for regular listening on my MP3 player.  That's  two thirds of the CD and a better track record than I have with most current offerings.<br />I was expecting to hear some catchy songs on this CD and I wasn't let down.  A Big Hunk O' Love, Devil In Disguise, Teddy bear get me dancing around and having a ball.  But I was impressed that he also sing song slike Crying In The Chapel and In The Ghetto.  People always claim he was versitile, but this collection actually proved it to me.  Oh, and the remix of Way Down is terrific!  One of my favorite tracks.<br />So has teh CD made me a confirmed Elvis fan?  No.  But I won't be so quick to dismiss him as before I had it.  So why not 5 stars?  Well, like I said I only ripped 20 of the songs, soe really grated on me.  But the ones I liked, I enjoy quite a bit.  Pick it up.  You have more chance of being pleasnatly surprised than not.
B000068QY7|4.0|This is definitely the best work of Oasis since Morning Glory. After the erratic Be Here Now and the truly awful Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants, this is a welcome return to form. It features classic Oasis songs, good solid album songs and just a couple of not so good songs.<BR>1. Hindu Times - Great riff, great tune, classic Oasis<BR>2. Force Of Nature - Another fine solid Oasis song<BR>3. Hung In A Bad Place - A fine example of proper rock (have a listen Slipknot!)<BR>4. Stop Crying Your Heart Out - Absolutely fantastic, this is just a wonderful Oasis ballad, a true anthem classic<BR>5. Songbird - Good but short, should be better than it is<BR>6. Little By Little - Words cannot describe it, a true classic<BR>7. A Quick Peep - An unnecessary filler<BR>8. All In The Mind - Good, solid song<BR>9. She Is Love - The one that grows on you most, very nice indeed<BR>10. Born On A Different Cloud - Again, grows on you<BR>11. Better Man - Not so convinced but not bad.<br />There is a secret track but it is dire!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Tobey Maguire is outstanding as Peter Parker, the nerdy high school student who moonlights as Spider-Man. I absolutely loved this movie. It was definitely better on the big screen but you still get the feel of it on DVD. Willem Dafoe plays a terrific villan and is very eerie. I thought it was well written and acted. I highly recommend this movie to all ages. It sure beats some of the other comic book movies that were so awful, words can't describe (Tank-girl, Judge Dredd, Batman Forever, etc) I think it's the best movie to date.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne sounds great. Those of you out there saying you cant believe she got an album contract must be out of your mind. Avril Lavigne is beautiful and has a wonderful voice. Who cares what kind of music she sings (punk,pop whatever) It sounds good and her album is good.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|A mildy amusing film, which pretty much rehashes the same story. It gets a little tiresome and the plot was non existant (I'm sure it was somewhere, I just couldn't find it) Most part 2's aren't as good as the first one, this falls true for MIB too. It had some funny moments, especially about how all Post office employees are aliens. I got this DVD as a present, I don't think I would buy it...
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love this cd is a most have. I love to lsten to it. i love to dance with the song dirrty and the fighter, and the can't hold us down. If you buy this cd you will love it, ignore the people who said that the cd is the worst and if you think that the cd doesn't make sence you are wrong! probably if you are another pop artist fanatic you might think that your artist is the best and the only one who rocks is the one you are into. But take your time to listen to the cd and you will love it.And for those who thinks that the cd is bad because you have heard dirrty, i have to let you know that is not fair that you ignore the whole cd because you don't like one song.Is a most buy cd.If you are a fan its a most have collection.
B00005JL3A|2.0|THIS MOVIE WASNT WAHT I HAD THOUGHT. ITS ALL THE WRONG THING. U THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. IF I WAS U THEN I WOULDNT GO AND SEE IT.
B00005JLXC|5.0|Take the ultimate dare! Whew! This movie looks so great! Okay let me go through all the cast. Ben Affleck. Now at first I said Ben as a superhero, when rappers turn proper! However, Ben looked pretty good in the DD costume! I guess red is his color. Another A+ for the movie. Instead of molded black rubber that show nipples and abs like the motion picture Batman & Robin (a tragedy in the superhero movies line up)Ben sports a garnet red leather jacket complete with pants boots and nightstick! Then theres Elektra played by the youthful Jennifer Garner who stars on ABC's Alias. Clad in a tight black clevage revealing outfit, Jennifer make a good villainess wielding two sharp daggers! Colin Farrell has his fame rising ever so more because he makes a great Bulleye. The fight scenes between him Elektra and DD should be pretty good. Bullseye's weapon of choice: little throwing stars not to be confused with Batarangs! And rounding up the bunch is Mr. Micheal Clark Duncan. And he is The Kingpin. Now in the comics Kingpin is a caucasian, but Mike isnt bad as the Kingpin. He can play a pretty mean part despite what others may say. That DEEP voice does it all! So basically in this movie you can expect, daggers,hi-tech nightsticks that can turn into grappling hooks, throwing stars and a man with a DEEP voice! Waalah! The potential of a good movie. With an all star cast, a love scene, matrix type fighting, and dark setting, Daredevil should certainly be a great movie! I cannot wait to get it on DVD!
B000001GXI|3.0|Bohm and the Berlin are wonderful.  I don't mind the slow tempi as it allows the orchestra and the singers to focus on the sound.  All the male singers are top-notch. Wunderlich, as others have noted, is the best Tamino ever. What a beautiful voice and what a tragedy to lose him so young. <br />However, the women singers are a train wreck, especially Peters, who is simply not even close to being up to the task. Unable to hit her notes, she simply shrieks her way through &quot;Holle Rache.&quot; What was Bohm thinking?<br />So, ultimately, this version is frustratingly flawed. Compare the women singers here to Klemperer's version.  Klemperer not only has the full and creamy-voiced Gundula Janowitz for Pamina, he has Lucia Popp as Queen of the Night, tossing off  pitch perfect bell-like high notes in spectacular fashion. To top it off, Klemperer has Elisabeth Schartzkopf and Christa Ludwig as two of his ladies! Unbelievable. <br />So, if you're only going to get one Magic Flute, it cannot be this one because there are plenty others which are all-around better.  But, if you're going to have several versions, then by all means add this one to your collection for Wunderlich and Bohm. I'm going to burn my own version of The Magic Flute from my various versions and Wunderlich will definitely sing the Tamino role and Lucia Popp will be my Queen of the Night.<br />Perfection.<br />PS: To all those who think that Peters is doing a good job here, please listen to Lucia Popp or Sumo Jo, or even Cheryl Studer to hear how it really should sound. Then you'll understand what we're talking about here.
B00005JLXC|2.0|Most of the reviews I had read already here were actually based on viewing the trailer of Daredevil, and ended with the words \\"I'm sure the movie will be great.\\"<br />Yeah, i saw that trailer too.  It ....<br />In a way, it's sad.  I spent the first hour thinking \\"it'll improve soon. Really.  Just as soon as the flashback stops/ Jennifer Garner turns up/ Bullseye appears.\\"  How can i put this - it DIDN'T.<br />The first warning is the title sequence (yes, it's that bad), curiously reminiscent of.. Spiderman! Surprise. Not the last time I would be thinking that, either.<br />OK, nice first image; gothic, creepy.  That red leather isn't *quite* working, but it's early days, right...?<br />Wrong. Cue a, what, 20 minute flashback that exists purely to pile sentimental ... upon more sentimental ....  I'm not caring already.  The trailer sold me cool fights... um, don't expect a ... thing until the childhood trauma is well and truly driven home with a sledgehammer.  And the really sad thing?  It's nothing new. It's nothing we haven't seen a billion times before, better acted, and most definitely better scripted.<br />After the sentimental stuff, a couple of flashes of how good this could have been, given a little talent: the rendering of the 'radar' sense (whilst entirely illogical) is clever and cinematically works. It's new, it's *different*.  <br />Here, the plot departs from logic with screaming haste.  Yes, we understand little Matt has the radar-sense-thingy.  We do not understand, and are never offered any explanation for, why he is suddenly as agile as Spidey. Only, y'know, lacking any visible webslinging powers. Note to the cack-handed scriptwriter/ director: THIS MAKES NO SENSE. It so obviously exists purely to provide 'cool' visuals in the fight scenes that, quite frankly, aren't even done very well.<br />Moving swiftly on... I don't remember Ben Affleck ever being quite this dire. After an embarrassingly bad courtroom scene, the first action set piece is.. yup, pretty dire. The leather outfit gets worse by the moment. The requisite cool visuals are completely obscured half the time, which left me blinking in confusion as to who or what was supposedly getting their ... kicked.  I was still blinking in confusion a minute later, when I realised someone had been watching the subway scene from The Matrix a little too often... and then comes a little character development that makes me wonder why this guy is our hero, exactly.  <br />Still, that little spark of hope remains... the script perks up with the entrance of Jon Favreau.  The guy's funny, he gets a couple of decent lines, and hey, Elektra's about to turn up...<br />*shudder*  Jennifer Garner can act. Jennifer Garner can fight convincingly on screen. I know this, having sat through a season of Alias.  Guess what?  This script (and fight choreography) doesn't seem to agree.  I kept expecting her to break into one of Sydney's tortured speeches (anything being better than the drivel that passes for character development in this) but no.  The initial showdown between her and Matt in a kid's playground is so barkingly nonsensical that I was staring at the screen in disbelief.<br />And so on and so forth.  It's not even enjoyably bad; it just keeps setting up potentially cool scenarios, only to fail to see them through.  In some ways, it does perk up when Bullseye shows up.  A barely recognisable Colin Farrell gurns his way through as a manic little leprechaun who can't miss a shot to kill anyone with *anything* (old lady with peanut was a classic.  In a completely amoral way...).  Kingpin is, frankly, a bit underwhelming.  On the plus side, some fairly decent songs are used to drown out the bad acting most of the time.. the soundtrack looks half decent, considering...<br />The Valentine day opening means one trailer campaign focuses on the romantic pairing of Matt and Elektra, which is ironic given that this is one of the least convincing screen romances I've ever seen.  She likes him because.. um, well, cos he's blind? He likes her because, hey, she's hot. And she can kick .... For Absolutely No Apparent Reason. I'm guessing a whole chunk of backstory got ditched along the way, but what is unforgiveable is the waste of the only source of tension this plot has in their relationship.  Far as I can see, this should have been what the plot hinged upon. As it is, it's meaningless and shallow, aiming to set up a sequel far too lazily.<br />That's a prospect that really irritates me: a sequel to a film that managed to spend this much money on such an awful script and bad direction (the same guy being responsible for both should give you a clue).  I spent half the plot wondering if anyone had bothered to proofread the script before they went into production, as it unashamedly and amateurly ... half a dozen better movies without drawing breath (mainly Spiderman and the Matrix).  Sure, girls may go to drool over Ben Affleck, but the guy has never looked less attractive (get that flabby, unshaven chin beneath the halloween mask. *urgh*). Sure, guys may go for the action (hmm. Could do much, much better.) They'd all be better off staying home to watch Spiderman again, unfortunately.<BR>Here's me wishing I had...
B00005JLXC|5.0|I was wondering how long it would take to see Frank Miller's version of Daredevil to become a major motion picture.  Although some things have been changed and Bullseye has no costume it's a very good film.  It is more realistic than Spiderman and I'd like to say much better. I think this would make a great TV series because DD fights contemporary criminals like the Kingpin and other parasites of society.  Let's hope we see them again in some type of series.  Daredevil like Spiderman deserves a sequel.
B000002UB6|4.0|Let it Be is a soundtrack without a movie, at least until the film is pieced together and released someday. Recorded prior to Abbey Road, but released afterward, the songs on Let it Be came out of miles of tape mostly recorded live then shelved due to internal squabbles. The material is less than perfect, but that doesn't mean the Beatles don't still blow most other bands away with less than their best.<br />For the late period Beatles, I like Abbey Road better, but this disk is full of emotion and intensity. For a disintegrating band, there are some surprisingly unified pieces, such as &quot;Two of Us&quot; &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; and &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; which feature multi-part vocal with John and Paul. My knock is that these songs could have been better. The martial beat in the breaks of &quot;Two of Us&quot; is stiff, and Ringo's drumming is mostly uninspired.<br />&quot;Across the Universe&quot; still moves me, even with the syrupy strings. I love the &quot;j'ai guru deva ohm...nothing's gonna change my world&quot; part.<br />Paul's &quot;Let it Be&quot; is a classic, but he was right that Phil Spector drenched &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; with overwrought strings.<br />&quot;Get Back&quot; has a locomotive like western shuffle feel and some quirky gender-twisting lyrics. I never thought John Lennon played many lead guitar parts, but when you see the film footage, that's him doing some cool fills and solos. Maybe his best guitar playing on record? Somewhere out there is a version with Paul singing in German!<br />George Harrison gets a little strident on &quot;I Me Mine&quot; but this song rocks. Better is &quot;For You Blue&quot; a little 12-bar blues shuffle with tasty slide guitar.<br />&quot;Dig It&quot; doesn't really qualify as a song, since it's more of a circular political statement and there are no chord changes or bridges and the song goes nowhere. There's an even longer version available on bootleg.<br />&quot;Maggie Mae&quot; is another joke tune, but the record is interspersed with little ditties and bits.<br />Worth a look, but not the Beatles at their best.  Buy Abbey Road and the White Album first.tune, but the record is interspersed with little ditties and bits.<BR>Worth a look, but not the Beatles at their best.

B00006LLJ4|4.0|Why is Steven Spielberg so insistent in using the &#34;Bleach-Bypass&#34; color processing in his films.  Minority Report would have been alot better with just normal colors.  The use of dark shadows can be very effective to create a cold and damp feeling, and it can be done with normal colors and rich black & white, i.e. [[ASIN:B0018CMJSU The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset DVD]] (1972) and [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (1941).   I am not a Tom Cruise fan at all, but I sure did enjoy Colin Farrell being in this film.  Thanks to this DVD company for offering this DVD in Full Screen and Wide Screen.  I will watch and buy full-screen anytime.  I wish film makers would stop using the &#34;Bleach-Bypass&#34; color in films.   This &#34;Minority Report&#34; story was originally developed to be a sequel to [[ASIN:B000IHL52W Total Recall]] (1990) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.   Colin Farrell did star in the remake to Total Recall (2012). [[ASIN:B005LAII3A Total Recall (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] (2012).    Minority Report tv series (FOX-TV 2015-present).  Set 10 years later after Minority Report (2002). Stars  Stark Sands, Meagan Good and Wilmer Valderrama.

B00004XPPC|2.0|I will watch just about any movie with William Holden in it and I have been curious to see the much hyped The Bridge On The River Kwai.  Well, I was disappointed and was very bored by the film.  It made me think of renting Bataan (1943) with a young Desi Arnaz.  Not many bonuses in this DVD.  I do like the computer special effects in &quot;Main Menu&quot; and the selection to show a frame of the rain during &quot;subtitles selection&quot;.  I love the sound of rain.  Idea: Some company should make a DVD of two hours of rain.
B000002GBD|5.0|Nazareth's 1975 hit album Hair of the Dog is one of the best rock albums in history, and this album contains the band's only hit single LOVE HURTS which went Top 10 in early 1976 on the American charts, the title track is a classic too and it's a rock radio staple.<BR>HAIR OF THE DOG<BR>The title track and a hard rock/metal masterpiece which shows the band to be reckoned with, I'll never forget the first time I'd first heard of this song when I was about 10 or 11 years old, I was shocked, and when I first heard of this song on the radio I was totally shocked. 5/5<BR>MISS MISERY<BR>This song kicks major a##, and it should've been another rock radio staple like the title track and it has a great sing along chorus. 5/5<BR>LOVE HURTS<BR>The band's only hit single which hit Top 10 and this song was a classic rock ballad, even though it was their most successful song of all time but it's not one of my favorites. 4/5<BR>CHANGIN' TIMES<BR>This song has it all, great chorus, verses and extended solos, what more do you want from a song. 5/5<BR>BEGGAR'S DAY<BR>This song is in the same vein as the title track and MISS MISERY and it's not quite a classic but it's a good song.<BR>4/5<BR>ROSE IN THE HEATHER<BR>The album's only instrumental and the only real filler track on this album. 3/5<BR>WHISKEY DRINKIN' WOMAN<BR>This song is awesome and boy, aren't there too many alcoholics in the world, oh well, it's an improvement over the last two songs. 5/5<BR>PLEASE DON'T JUDAS ME<BR>The near 10 minute epic about betrayal and despise and this song is haunting, too bad that they don't make as much epics anymore like they used to. 5/5<br />If you're a hard rock/classic rock fan, then you should get this album cause it rocks.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|My son enjoys a variety of music and often will hold out something to share with me, which is what he did with T.A.T.U.<BR>I sat and listened to the entire CD and found myself enjoying it beyond merely *OK*. <BR>After I listened to it and decided I quite liked it, I did an online search to find out what they are all about. What interesting reading. I guess it doesn't much matter to me if they happened because of a 'marketing ploy'. The fact is I enjoyed the CD - which is what's important to me. ...If a lot of people enjoy what they created well then they should make money, eh? I don't get all the fussing about these two girls. It's entertainment, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  A nice change from some of the drivel the local radio stations play! If their subsequent music is as enjoyable- one of us will be spending money to have it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I heard of t.A.T.u. about a month ago from a friend.  He said something about techno russian lesbians.  He's not gay, so he doesn't understand what a big deal it is for a homosexual (or two) to release a CD in America.  He sort of has bad tastes in music and he told me they [were bad].  That night I downloaded all I could to see if I could prove him wrong.  Once again, he was wrong about music.  t.A.T.u. definitely has their own sound, voice, and style.  It's not just the english versions of their songs.  Their russian songs are extraordinary as well.  (ex. Robot, Nas Nie Dogonyat, and La Soshla s Uma.)  This CD is definitely worth it.  t.A.T.u. is worth your time.<br />t.E.A.m. t.A.T.u. member,<BR>tuk_tuk_tuk
B000056KTG|3.0|You can tell by the cover art and song list that this is not the original &quot;Raw Power&quot; albumn.  In fact, all of this has been released before on cds like &quot;Rough Power&quot;, &quot;Rubber Legs&quot;, and &quot;Head On&quot;, ie, alternate versions and demos recorded at the famous &quot;Detroit Rehearsals&quot;.  For me, the pleasure of finding something like this to collect still outweighs being annoyed at having to buy it, but for you it depends on how much you already have, and how much you want.  The music of course is 5 stars, but i gave it 3 as a warning.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|If you like the sound of \\"All the Things She Said\\" you wont be disappointed with the rest of the songs on \\"200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane\\".<br />There are at least several more number one hit songs on this album, (if released) from the 11 there. I couldn't find a bad track from the collection anywhere.<br />This album is a mixture of rock, pop, dance, and a little bluesy, with a fantastic Russian twist thrown in for good measure.<br />And of course the girls ain't bad... Only the music matters to me.<br />I believe that they have an open, honest friendship, and do love each other...<br />But - I do love them.<br />And - I do love their music.<br />I can't stop playing their music, makes one happy...
B00000JCOV|4.0|Surely a successful one! These guys rock. The only thing wrong is that the song &quot;wait and bleed&quot; is way overplayed and MTV-ized, which makes you want to listen to it once, and not play it again for a few months. The anti-everyone and everything song &quot;Surfacing&quot; is my favorite song off this album. Slipknot is a great band to listen to when you are mad at everyone and everything. Their third Cd, Iowa, is better in my opinion.
B000069HK2|5.0|...  I love music of all kinds(in my cd player right now: Disturbed, Thrice, Dashboard Confessional, Maroon 5, and Chopin(classical for folks who don't know..)and i think that this album has good song writing, musicianship, and production.  The songs are catchy, Quinn does quite a few good things with his guitar, the drumming's great, and I think that Bert's vocals and melodies can say a lot.  My personal favorite song is #6 Buried Myself Alive.  Outta the gates, the guitar hits you in the face, and keeps the song moving.  The guitar comes to a nice dynamic change in the verse, and the vocals take over nicely.  I just think it's a well written song, so there's my two cents. As for everyone saying \\"Go buy the Glassjaw album\\", is that really helpful?  I agree, if you like this type of music, go buy the Glassjaw album, it's awesome, but I definatly recommend checking out this album as well, because it's awesome too.  Check out the song clips off the cdnow site, and if you dig it, check out the whole album, it's worth it I think.
B0000640SA|4.0|This is a superb movie.  I would buy it and watch it.  However...be forewarned, the second DVD that is available on the limited release has the most annoying menu structure.  You have to play like you are answering psychological questions in order to continue an aimless hunt for the special features.  I can appreciate creativity and trying to add an extra dimension of fun but this just gets in the way.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a great book. It allows a person to stretch their imagination, and step into a futuristic world. This is a great book for everyone to read! I read this book when I was 13, and I just read it again at the age of 18, and I enjoyed as much the second time as I did the first! <BR>  Reading this book will make you feel fortunate to live in a free, liberal, open society. I bet you have never thought what the world would be like with out color, or music, or even love. This book will help your mind wonder into a place where none of these things exist. <BR>  I highly recommend The Giver to anyone looking to read a great book!!
0380973650|1.0|I bought American Gods because of all the hype and because I had read Neverwhere and loved it. All I can say is that American Gods was a failure... I can handle machco, but the writing was poor and poor writing is unforgivable. Where was his editor? I especially loved lines such as \\"She entered the room through the door.\\" So? She was in a funeral home. What was she going to do, pop in through the window? Neil Gaiman is not a great writer; he is an opportunist taking advantage of a book-buying public no longer capable of reading anything more sophisticated than a three line blip thrown across a televison screen. I wasted my money. Boo hoo.
B000069HK2|5.0|Everyone probably knows about The Used from the popular hit MTV show &quot;The Osbournes&quot; because of Kelly Osbourne and the lead singer.  Even without that kind of exposure they still rock out hard.<br />You can hear the emotion and the power in the lead singers voice.  &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; is a perfect song.  He uses his powerful voice to scream and then sing.  &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; is another song that just rocks out without caring.  He goes from singing to screaming and back to singing all within 2 seconds.  It's hardcore for the hardcore and emo for the emotionals.<br />Then it busts into calmer songs like &quot;On My Own&quot; where he just calms down and plays his acoustic guitar.  Also, &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; shows a lot of emotion and calms down the singer.  It's really a nice mix.<br />The other songs on the CD kick like &quot;Bulimic&quot; and &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot;.  It's a perfect mix of hardcore, punk, emo.  They are even better than Thursday my other favorite in the genre.  I am going to see them in April and hope that this CD is only a small part of their greatness.  Definetly pick it up if you like hardcore with emo tendancies.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This cd has got to be one of the best cd's I own. I think audioslave has completely reinvented rock music as I know it. With the amazing vocals of Chris Cornell and the exciting guitar of Tom Morrello. This is definetly a change for the better. If there's one album to buy this is probably the one.
B000002HAF|5.0|In all honesty The Pixies are one of the greatest bands ever to walk this fine earth and this splendid cd's proof of that.<br />Bone Machine (5/5) Black Francis's constant yelps and Deal's voice create one great opener.<br />Break My Body (4/5)- A great little song.  One of the Pixies many songs about mutilation<br />Something Against You (3/5)- I just really don't dig this song too much.  It is not that I don't like yelling though cause I like both Dead and Rock Music.<br />Broken Face (7/5)- An absolutely superb song, so much soul in this song and Black Francis's unique voc's on this album add up to one thing. Superb<br />Gigantic- (8/5) Possibly one of the best songs ever written.<br />River Euphrates (5/5)- An odd sort of weaved song all adding to one jumbled, but exellent song.<br />Where Is My Mind- (9/5) This is also one of the best songs of all time.  The nonconventional dreamlike instrumentals and faint singing makes a great song.<br />Cactus- (5/5) A great song with great lyrics.<br />Tony's Theme (5/5) Easily a five but maybe a little too goofy to get anything higher.<br />Oh My Golly (5/5) The spanish/english transition works especially good on this song.<br />Vamos (6/5) A total epic.  And then the guitars seemed to explode midway giving it a 6.<br />I'm Amazed (5/5) The beginning of this song [is bad] but the actualy music is great.<br />Brick Is Red (5/5) A nice end song, it is sort of dreary and lo fi giving a nice finishing touch to a excellent album

0786915749|1.0|I guess if your a teenager looking for a written form of Dungeons and Dragons this series may be the best thing it the world to you.  But, if you're an adult that likes character development, plot line development, believable situations (yes, this can happen in a fantasy novel), then don't look here.  I found the characters notably shallow, not self motivated, and frankly overly boring and unbelievable.  The world seemed better thought out than the characters were.  Certain races were so simplistic in their placement in the book showing that there is no real reason for their existance other than to be the 'band-aid' to cover poor planning on the part of the authors.  The interaction between the races is predictably boring and again, not believable.  I bought the first three in this series.  After reading this first one, I'll toss the rest into the garbage.  Look elsewhere if you're seeking a real fantasy novel.  This is teenie-bop heaven.  If you're a kid, have fun.  If you've grown up, try Robin Hobb, Melanie Rawn, Robert Jordan, Tolkien, Stephen Donaldson ... there are too many good authors to list that will keep you enraptured in fantastical worlds.  Don't waste good reading time with this kiddie junk.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|This is a great movie, though I wouldn't recommend showing it to small children due to some violent battle scenes. Mulan is the beautiful young Chinese girl that has a kind of tomboyish way of thinking, way after her time. After having a terrible time at the Matchmaker, she learns that her father, being the only man of the house, is being called off to war. She knows that he is not in fighting health, and that he would surely get hurt in battle. In order to save her father, she cuts her hair and pretends to be a man and goes off to war in his place, posing as a little known son. After going through a rigorous training course, led by the lovable male figure of the movie, she is ready for battle accompanied by Crick-Kee, Mushu the dragon, and her horse. Mulan encounters some face to face combat with the Huns, and eventually is injured. She heals, but the injury revealed her true gender. She is sent home with a strict warning, but overhears a plan of attack on the emperor by the Huns. She rushes to the palace to warn the army, but because of her history, she is not believed. When the Huns arrive, she pulls together the army and engages in a swordfight with the leader of the Huns. After a close escape, she defeats the Hun leader, and watches in amazment as the emperor presents her to the crowd and she sees everywhere, the people of China bowing down in respect to her. She is awarded the position of Emperor's advisor, and the respect and trust of everyone. This movie has some great music, the best by far being \\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\\". It also has some great humor, thanks to Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy. This is one of the best Disney movies that you can get and really has a good lesson to it. You should definitly buy this movie. It's historically accurate, too!

B000084T18|5.0|When nobody thought that 50 Cent could get any hotter, he came out with this fresh CD, which definiey blows away all of his old beats.  With ever song havin its own style, every lyric having its own unique 50 Cent sound to it, I would definitely recommend this CD to any modern music lover.  The only thing i could say about this CD negatively is that i wanted to hear a little more from Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks.  Overall, this CD is the saving grace from all that garbage out rite now.

B000055Y0Y|5.0|This is a marvelous film which you surely will enjoy if you like the genre.  By far the best performance I've seen by Eastwood--<BR>outstanding.  But the real ringer here is John Malkovich--far more intelligent and just as lethal a foe as any faced by our current film heroes.  I agree he should have won an Oscar.  An unforgettable performance.  When he's on the screen, either in person or by phone, the intensity is palpable.  Someone should pit Malkovich as villian against Tommy Lee Jones as hero--that would be very interesting.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I really recommend this cd... it's just one of those that, when you hear, you like, you go search for the lyrics and you find out i'ts not just...love songs, they go out straight from the heart, it's... AMAZING!!!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first heard t.A.T.u.'s single &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; I thought it was a really cool song.  Shortly after I felt I had to buy the album, &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane&quot; to see just how the rest of their music was.  Instantly I fell in love.  This is a wonderful album and I listen to it quite a lot, especially when I'm working out at the gym.
0316666343|5.0|I didn't want to read this book at first.  I had several reasons.  As a rape survivor, I usually try to avoid the topic since it brings up painful memories.  I was sure the story would be depressing  (what else could a child's rape and murder be?), and the world is dark enough these days.  But primarily I didn't want to pick it up since books that are suddenly popular often turn out to be some kind of disappointment, usually too shallow or too shocking.  When I started to read this book, I didn't want to put it down.<br />The first person telling of the murder and rape from a young victim's view sounds so sensationalized.  But Sebold is no yellow journalist.  This is the tender telling of the effects of this killing by someone (revealed early) known to the little girl, a mystery to the family.<br />This is not a murder mystery along the lines of bestselling, popular shock writers.  It isn't written from any kind of formula, but is loosely based on the author's own rape as a college student (though thankfully, she lives to tell her tale).  In this fictionalized story, the murder is never truly solved, or resolved, though eventually everyone knows 'who dunnit.'<br />A soft and thoughtful read, sad but hopeful too as our young victim watches how lives are changed, and how life goes on, after her death.  Look for 'Lucky,&quot; her equally well-written story of the real life rape, and the changes it brings to her life and that of her family.
0440214041|4.0|On one of my many British excursions, I faced one dilemma: a six-hour flight and nothing to read. Desperate, I set out to find something to keep me amused during the aforementioned hours -- and I stumbled upon John Grisham's The Pelican Brief. I admit that I am not a Grisham fan, for I've always thought his books are too commercial and trite, but I am rather impressed with this one. It is quite an entertaining thriller.<br />After having witnessed a murder, Darby Shaw seeks the help of an ambitious reporter. After putting all the pieces together, Shaw discovers that she had been the intended mark. What follows is Grisham's signature twists and thrill rides. The Pelican Brief entertained me throughout the gruesome flight. I enjoyed it. From hereon in, I shall give Grisham the benefit of the doubt...
B00005JLXC|3.0|This movie started off great. Beautiful style, cool visual effects and great development of back story to Daredevil. That was the best part unfortunately. The characters all had very cool introductions and looked amazing and then I just wanted them to do something. ANYTHING!<br />The movie ends in a very unsatisfactory way. Of course we know there will be sequels to the sequels but show us something in the meantime to make us want to come back. The end leaves you feeling somewhere between a commercial break and a season finale but without any actual cliffhanger even, just an 'I'll be back' cliche equivalent. Very disappointing.
078401213X|5.0|The movie \\"Pi\\" is the journey of a mind on a quest, one that is a naturally driven human endeavor to find those secrets of life's many meanings.  \\"Pi\\" seems to have a pre-requisite need of a 150 IQ to be fully understood tho.  The depth of looking for those subtle patterns in nature, can be disruptive to the psychological-dynamics of the working mind.  The grainy black and white texture of the movie is not meant as a pretentiously artistic display, but meant to represent the hazy process of an obsessively focused mind working on a resolution.  \\"Pi\\" is the all-encompassing and all-consuming mental state of 'Tripped Breakers', one that sits on the edge of salvation and/or insanity.  In other words;  A true \\"Twilight Zone\\" state of mental consciousness.<br />If you have ever pondered on a topic that does not fit the ability of the minds capacity to understand, then you know what happens when the mind trips its breakers.  The subject of a God, that always was and always will be, is a good topic to attain this state of tripped breakers.  Just try to ponder on the possibility of a life force, that had no beginning or birth which will extend into infinity or will never die.  Such an ad infinitum going in two directions at the same time is not a concept that can be rationalized by the finite abilities of the human mind.<br />You may believe in a God with no beginning or no end, but rationalizing it is another thing.  Sean Gullette who plays Max Cohen, has an intuitive understanding that a pattern to the mathematical equation of Pi exists, a pattern which will explain many of the mysteries of life itself.  Director Darren Aronofsky gets a triple-kudos for an excellent job of weaving this journey together with those subtle paranoias, that accompany such a mental state as 'Tripped Breakers'.<br />Rating: triple-kudos
B0000636UN|4.0|C'mon,C'mon is a well-paced, well-played release from Sheryl Crow. The tracks, for the most part, are strong and reveal that Ms. Crow still has what it takes to create and display top-notch showmanship. Steve McQueen, Soak Up the Sun, and Over You are arguably the dominant songs in this CD.<br />An all-around, entertaining piece, C'mon,C'mon is, I have found, quite compatible with my workouts, especially if the upcoming task is several minutes on a treadmill or some cross-trainer machine. Along with the aforementioned songs, Lucky Kid is a bouncy number that creates a perk, and it fares quite well in comparison to those compiled exercise CD's.<br />As a quick summary note, if you like the Corrs, then their imported Best Of collection pairs up quite nicely with this Sheryl Crow masterpiece.
6305907145|4.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and that is what inspired me to read the book. It was (is) a sluggish book and it took me quite a wile to get through. The movie on the other hand was lively and enjoyable and the right amount of time. Frances O'Conner is now one of my favorite actresses due to this movie, because she acts so well in here. The mean characters do a wonderful job being mean wile also being sympathetic-which isn't easy to do. To those people who complain about it being &quot;to altered&quot; they should try reading the book- then they may realize how much better a movie it is. Also I believe that Julia is played by Justine Wallach (or whatever her last name is).
B0000060NF|5.0|This is one of the most profound releases of all time. Not only is What's Going On a collection of some of the greatest R&B music ever, but it is simultaneously an American history class and, over thirty years after the fact, a thorough summary of current events that tells it like it is more than any recent State of the Union address.<br />With themes that deal with the ecology, the economy, struggling to make ends meet, and war, Marvin Gaye's lyrics in What's Going On are perhaps more relevant today than they were back during its release in 1971. Unlike so much of today's media and their commentators, Gaye got to the heart of the matter and gave insight to what is important in this country. <br />If only America would wake up and see where things are headed. Listening to this material would be an important start, for it is no Dog and Pony show that seems so pervasive in what has seemed to become a less enlightened, less civilized culture.
0446678430|4.0|This approach will be different from other reviews on this book which focuses on the surface-level mechanics of the facts and the strategies that are very generically presented by the author.  However, in a philosophical context, there are many elements in this book, and it isn't one of those \\"get rich, retire young-how to\\" books.  The variety of concepts in it can help people in sales, in starting their own business, and thinking more carefully of the Risks and Rewards of their actions, whether financial, personal, or professional.  Overcoming self-doubt, fear, negativity, laziness, learning from our failures, and consistently thinking \\"outside of the box,\\" are many things Robert Kiyosaki reminds us of in this piece.  And he's also \\"been there and done it.\\" <br />For Kiyosaki, the concept of failure is important to the learning experience, and what we learn from our failures in life can help us succeed in the future.  Kiyosaki related the failure of his first two businesses and his own self-doubt at a certain period of his life (in the beginning of the book).  He noted this about who his Rich Dad and he think losers are: \\"many losers bet only on sure things....job security, a steady paycheck, garaunteed pension, and interest from a bank account.\\"  another quote: \\"the problem of having a job, is that it gets in the the way of getting rich,\\" his Rich Dad said.  I see this statement as clear and true for not all, but most people.  For example, look around at the people you know.  They've got a \\"job\\" that took up the majority of their mental and physical energy and time.  They bought a home with a mortgage.  Endgame: like a hamster spinning on the wheel.  The illusion of movement.  This person is now the leverage for his/her employer, the one who really makes the money.  <br />Some repeated themes which we should be reminded by is what Kiyosaki stated numerous times in different ways using different real-life examples: \\"What we think is real becomes reality, in most cases\\" (p. 54). He adds that we human beings often try to substantiate and reinforce our beliefs and perceptions of reality.  This can lead to self-defeating behavior and/or missed opportunities to see the opportunities that present themselves in front of us.  \\"One of the most important things to learn is to take control of your reality\\" (p. 54).  If one is a pessimist, has self-doubt, or believes \\"it can't be done,\\" it won't be done.  R.K. reminds us these truisms affect the decisons we make in life.  <br />Throughout the book there is redundancy, but there are mostly positives here. He also incorporates some of the principles of his Cash Flow Quadrant in this piece.  He has the reader fill in a list of things that the reader loves/hates.  Also important is the constant need to ask and answer \\"why\\" you are doing anything in life.  Not the \\"how\\" you do it, but the \\"why.\\"  He correctly asserts that if you know \\"why\\" you you can then focus your energies on the \\"how.\\"  R.K. sheds light on how bad believing in a 401k, and mutual funds is.  This is a practical common-sense guide and a positive motivator.  Read this to keep yourself continually thinking \\"outside the box.\\"
B000008LOV|5.0|...It was as though old friends had knocked on the door and started serenading us. We loved the Travling Wilburys sounds in the early 90s. Unfortunately, we live in the desert southwest, where the summer heat isn't kind to tape. So, after throwing out some warped tape, it never occurred to me to look for them on CD.<BR>We were talking about the Wilburys after listening to the most recent George Harrison CD. I went on Amazon.com and there was what I wanted...!
B000068TPN|4.0|We Were Soldiers is like Braveheart in Vietnam. It's like \\"The Patriot\\" in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.<br />Wallace made this movie and wanted it to be THE Vietnam film. He wanted to \\"Get it right\\". Now all he accomplished is nothing more than a technically stunning, but patriotic and truth-denying Braveheart in Vietnam film.<br />Don't get me wrong. This film is good. But it fails at telling the story of the Vietnam War. Totally.<br />There are nice approaches, but the general audience - who assumingly did not study the history of Vietnam - isn't told anything about the conflict, and how the USofA ruined Vietnam and the surrounding countries.<br />The DVD is good. The Quality is outstanding and the extras are good. If you are into Vietnam, or war movies in general, you should get this.
B00005JLXC|5.0|Being a comic book fan, I was a bit skeptical on how good this movie will be. Boy, this movie does not let me down at all. The film is quite true to the comic itself while it will not let newcomers out in the dark. Daredevil is not your regular superhero, he does not hesitate when giving bad guys their due(whether it be killing them or severely breaking their body parts...). Even the villians are a bit more evil than your \\"regular\\" villans(lets just say an senior citizen gets killed by a peanut).<br />Ben Affleck plays a convincing Matt Murdock(Daredevil). It was also enjoyable seeing one of my favorite Marvel character, Elektra, come to life on the big screen.<br />The film itself basically starts off with Daredevil's origin and leads you to how Daredevil gets a sticky situation between Elektra, Bullseye and Kingpin. The fight scenes were expertly done(thanks to a Hong Kong crew). I was never disappointed in this film. I reccomend it highly!
B000002U82|5.0|Before Roger Waters took over Pink Floyd and filled their music with drab rantings about how much he hates the world, Pink Floyd was the world's number one space-rock band.  &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is their best, most defining effort.  Musically, it seems like an extension of &quot;Echoes&quot;, the twenty-minute epic consisting of all of side two on their previous LP, &quot;Meddle&quot;.  Lyrically, it's a poetic and somewhat cynical view of the world.  Songs like &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; concentrate on the vices and the rush-around of modern life, and &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is an explanation of what can happen to you if they take over.<br />&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; was a truly revolutionary album in many ways that have been noted countless times by historians, critics, and fellow musicians.  But what makes &quot;Dark Side&quot; truly stand the test of time with &quot;normal&quot; audiences is that its messages haven't outdated.  In many ways, it's the ultimate coming-of-age album.  That, combined with the immaculate production and amazing soundscapes within, is the key reason why it continues to sell and be listened to 30+ years after its release.<br />Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is one of the best rock albums of all time.  It stands by itself among Pink Floyd's repertoire.  Previous to it, Pink Floyd were dabbling (&quot;Meddle&quot;-ing?) in the Syd Barrett world of psychedelic space-rock with youthful exuberance, and after it, Waters became essentially a bitter old man and began creating dark, dismal albums like &quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot;, and &quot;The Final Cut&quot;.  &quot;Dark Side&quot; showcases Pink Floyd at the turning point, looking to the future while enjoying the last few years of their official youth.  They may have made more ambitious or more &quot;epic&quot; albums, but they never made one better than &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.
0684867184|3.0|In Comrades, Stephen Ambrose delves into the topic of masculine relationships....fathers, brothers, pals, etc.  Beginning with his relationship with his own brothers, he moves on to explore the relationships of more famous people...Eisenhower and Patton, Lewis and Clark, and even Richard Nixon (in this case, a look at why Nixon had no meaningful relationships with anyone).  Most interesting though, is his coverage of the bonds and friendships formed between men who have served together in combat.  It is a very short read, but well worth it just for the tid-bits of biographical information that typically would not be found in other history books.
B000068TPN|5.0|This was one intense battle that went on around the clock, and it's amazing that the outnumbered US soldiers who fought it didn't come unglued against such odds against a well disciplined<BR>and determined enemy.  Even my wife enjoyed the movie, and she hates war flicks.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is by far one of the BEST SOAD albums out there.. Combining the wonderful SOAD spirit of the first album and the heavy sound of the second one... this album truly ROCKS...<BR>I downloaded parts of this album last year... 25 Leaked songs, 15 of which were recorded with Toxicity...

Go Buy the album and download songs like \\"Defy\\", \\"Waiting for you\\", \\"The Metro\\" and \\"Snowblind\\" in addition... Really worth it..
B0000041XX|5.0|True art, need not to be understood . . . just appreciated.<br />If there is such a concept as 'superb pop art', then this record is probably its best expression.<br />What a wonderful interpretations. Hear them is like touching a piece of heaven.  I hope all of you could share this experience with me.
B00005JLXC|4.0|I just got back from seeing \\"Daredevil.\\" I never read any DD comics when I was younger. I was more interested in X-Men and Spider-man. But I did know who he was and who the characters are. This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. The thing that shocked me the most was how dark this movie is. I can't believe it got away with a PG-13 rating. There's one scene in a bar where the music in the background uses very foul language while Bullseye is murdering a guy. This comes as a pleasant surprise to me as an adult but I worry about parents who take their young kids to see this movie about a super hero is a vigilante. The only thing I really did not like about DD was some of the action scenes. They used wire to help balance the actors and also allow them to make jumps that are not possible. That's fine but they did a horrible job making it look realistic. When a character jumps from one building to another it's as if they are landing on a cloud and they just keep on running before their feet even touch ground. They might as well have left the wire in the movie it's that obvious. But other than that I loved the story and can't wait for Daredevil 2.
B00005JLK1|4.0|This movie is great for horror movie fans, just a straigt up ghost story that's fun to watch and one hell of a kill scene and you get to see it twice also who and why the bad guy is there is an excellent twist
B00000HYXB|5.0|Although I have not yet purchased this alum, i have downloaded many of the tracks online, and from what i have heard, I will buy it very soon.  Is there a song for Beren and Tunivel?  If there is, please let me know in the next review written.  And if you havent read the Silmarillion, you should do so now.
0671027344|5.0|My friend made me read it, and now I am passing it on to all of my friends! Everyone in my school has read it as well. This book has so many twists and turns, that I got a little dizzy. But the ending will shock you! Read it, read it now!
B00005ARDC|5.0|Anyone who downplays the Jesus and Mary Chain connection is just fooling themselves. There may be other influences mixed in there, but bottom line is all JAMC. And I know it's intentional. Let's see...Name: BRMC vs. JAMC, frequent unflattering references to Jesus in lyrics, oceans of melodic feedback, black and white (mostly black) photos taken in the heart of downtrodden cities, mentions of firearms, blurring backlit stages, seriousness to the point of self-caricature, and a coolness that would freeze hades. That said, this album takes the early JAMC formula and creates some fine music. In fact, this album is a much more worthy successor to the JAMC's \\"Sound of Speed\\" than \\"Stoned and Dethroned\\" or (urrghh!) \\"Munki\\" could ever hope to be.<br />Are they derivative? Oh yeah. But you know what? If you're going to pick a band to emulate, why not choose the coolest \\"twins\\" to ever string a guitar? And as a bonus, take their greatest tunes and meld them into your own (semi-) original creations. The songs \\"Love Burns\\", \\"Rifles\\" and \\"Spread Your Love\\" particularly evoke the JAMC gospel. (And if any of you yung 'uns want more of this type of music, you can't go wrong with the JAMC's \\"Psychocandy\\", \\"Darklands\\", \\"Automatic\\", \\"Barbed Wire Kisses\\", \\"Honey's Dead\\" or \\"Sound of Speed\\".)<br />At first, I almost felt guilty liking this band due to my undying loyalty to the JAMC, but sometimes the masters have to pass the torch. And I have yet to find as talented a follow-up as the BRMC. Let's just hope they never try to emulate \\"Munki\\"...
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was broadcast in HDTV, so if I say the picture quality is superb, it's stating the obvious.  Yet I still think it needs to be said.  This series in one of the best excuses for buying a DVD player.  The audio?  Never mind the battle scenes, to measure the quality of the audio mixing and resolution of this box set, just keep your ears open for those typewriter sounds in the 'peaceful' scenes!! If you didn't know better, you'd think someone in your house is really typing on an old-style Underwood.  I had to rush out of the room and check (we do have a manual typewriter)!<br />Of course, I did feel sometime during my viewing that I was watching an extended version of Saving Private Ryan, which gets many repeat viewings from me.  But then I remembered: the movies are based on true stories, I shouldn't be complaining.  If there's a similarity, maybe because much of the creative genius in \\"Ryan\\" was in BOB too.<br />War movie enthusiasts will like the second episode (\\"Day of Days\\", the D-Day parachute drop) and the third (\\"Carentan\\").  The \\"Bastogne\\" episode is more like \\"Battleground (available on VHS)\\", they deal with the same event, more character development than gore, more snow than fire.  You'd get the idea just how cold it was there, and how desperate the defense was.  \\"Points\\" was heart-rending in the end.  And of course, there's the discovery of the concentration camp, which just about snuffs out your breath.  Many Americans went to war with little understanding of what they were fighting for.  Many were wondering what they were doing in Europe, when the first blow against them was struck by the Japanese.  After the finding of the concentration camps, there was no more debate.  They were fighting because a blow has been struck against humanity.<br />The performances were superb, and rightly toned down for the era (not too many swear words).  Damian Lewis has a screen presence that is rare today.<br />The real heroes of the last great war were not the high-profile men who got their names on history books.  The real heroes were the ordinary people who did the jobs that were handed to them, admirably and without fanfare.
B000084T18|5.0|I just got this cd and i really was thinking this was all hype but when i hurd every track its not hype is the real thing. 50 is one of the best rap'ers out there right now but i dont think its time to say his the next 2pac its really to soon to say. Every track is good on here the one with nate dogg(21 Questions) is one of the best tracks on the cd. The good thing about 50 is that he dont care what people say about him he does the damn thing his way like it or not i wish we could say that about alot more rapers out there but we cant he's lyrics are crazy and if i was you i would go cop the cd now cause everyone should just hear what he has to say.
B0000509BZ|1.0|I tried, lordie, I tried to watch the whole thing.  I just couldn't.  &quot;Highlander&quot; is wallowing somewhere near the top of my list of worst films of all time.  What's wrong with it?  Well, pretty much everything.  Christopher Lambert is such a wooden actor he should have tried out for the lead in Nutcracker.  No facial expression, no tone of voice, nothing.  The costumes, particularly the alleged 16th century Scotland getups, are like something out of a Studio 54 disco party.  The makeup --take a look at the layer of beige on Sean Connery, designed to make him look like an Egyptian or Spaniard or something, it's never clear which.  It misses parts of his face.  The music is ham-handed and intrusive, particularly during the fight scenes.  You can tell it's supposed to be exciting because the music gets real LOUD.  The scenery, awful.  There's the scene where Lambert gets dunked in the Scottish lake and discovers he doesn't drown... you can actually see the sides of the swimming pool festooned with plastic water plants.  There's the combat scene with Connery where the castle is made of plastic bricks that tumble down with every sword stroke.  <br />If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was a Monty Python sendup of the real dungeons-and-dragons genre.  Alas, it's not.  It's supposed to be serious.  Test yourself, see if you can watch it until the end.
0446310786|1.0|This book was so boring. I was forced to read it for Freshman English, but I didn't. I just couldn't get into it. It's been called a classic, but it just didn't have enough action. Or anything to relate to! F- for this book.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love this cd so much i can't stop listening to it! The words are wonderfully written i can relate to it. And i love the style of music they use. The beat is great and there voicies are beatiful. I really think everyone should get this cd and the future ones of there's!! Buy this cd!!
6300215717|5.0|This just has to be the most delightful and enjoyable fantasy movie ever. The story is very simple and a bit unbelievable, but the performances of Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck were superb, and made this just a great little movie. In the closing scenes there is just so much emotion shown in the eyes of these two performers, something mostly unseen in today's movies. Totally enjoyable with no nudity, violence or bad language. We highly recommend it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When i first bought this cd, i only bought it cause i liked \\"Cochise\\". I was very suprised that this sounds really not anything like RATM (thank God!!!). My personal favorites are: \\"Cochise\\", \\"Like A Stone\\", \\"Show Me How To Live\\", and \\"What You Are\\". I definitely recommend this to any rock or classic rock fan, I guarantee every song you'll love. Chris Cornell's voice is amazing and Tom Morello's guitar has a awesome distortion tone.
0786245972|5.0|The story is told by Susie, who was murdered by a neighbor.  While Susie is no longer a part of the real world, she is able to observe her family and her neighbor.  Life truly goes on after one dies, and Susie is able to see how her murder has affected her family.<BR>    Is Susie floating around on a cloud with Angels?  No.  Her heaven is beautiful and I think one reason that this story reasonates with so many, is that we want to believe that there is some kind of after life.  Alice Sebold's words and descriptions are absolutely stunning.  Some of her prose moved me to tears.<BR>   This book is certainly graphic in terms of the murder.  However, the remainder of the story is so beautiful that I did not want the story to end.  It is not a crime book, where the murder occurs, is investigated and the killer is found.  Instead, it is a story about a young girl who is murdered and what happens to her and her family after her death.  I have never ready such a moving and unusual book.  If you enjoy well written books and beautifully crafted language, this is a book for you.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I recommend this cd because it is a break through in music. Its not the typical pop music that us Americans are use too. The songs are very catchy and well crafted. If you don't purchase your this cd, your definitely missing out on a group that is soon going to take over the American airwaves. Every song on this album has a different meaning and touches your heart. You can feel every word that they sing and begin to understand what life is like simply growing up. Their not just seeing about Lesbian love...its about life. There doing what Nirvana did, just through a different light. Plus, with the enhancement you get a little glimpse into whats it like to hang around with Yulia &amp; Lena themselves.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie had me depressed for days, Very moving and emotionally draining. EXCELLENT! It's like a &quot;serious&quot; version of Trainspotting but in English &amp; way more of a buzzkill. Granted, this movie ROCKS! Don't get me wrong, Anyone can make a happy feel good movie with hugs and kisses... But this movie, oh man... I'm a loss for words.<br />Acting: Over the top. The movie lets you get to know each of<BR>        the 5 people, How sad each of them are as <BR>        their dreams become nightmares.<br />Soundtrack: Very groovie. <BR>           (I liked it so much I even got the soundtrack CD)<br />The DVD: Packed with DVD goodies!<br />Jennifer Connelly: Hottest Woman Alive!
B000008M54|5.0|This music just speaks to my soul. It is roots music, haunting, beautiful, familiar but refreshing. Mike Scott IS the Waterboys and he truly is a man with a vision. This time it REALLY came through.<br />I loved this so much back in 1988, that I went to see them at the Wiltern in L.A. all 3 nights in a row. I was alternately moved to tears and elated (I am not always so emotional!) I saw them again on a reunion tour at the House of Blues last year and was right in front of the stage. I stood directly in front of Steve Wickham, the man whose sound drove me to buy a fiddle which I still TRY to play! They were great, and I felt the magic again, it was amazing. <br />To me it is simply roots music, the place where the origins of Irish music, Scottish music, American country and blues music all come together and the lines that seperate them are erased. Check out the haunting steel guitar of &quot;When ye Go Away&quot;, of course the title track, and one of my favorite but less traditional songs, &quot;We will not be lovers&quot; for the frantic sounds of the fiddle. I love all the songs and so many are rare and exquisite gems! <br />Enjoy...
B000002KIK|3.0|This album is always criticised, and I can't figure out why. True, it may not be as powerful as PARANOID or MASTER OF REALITY, but this album is better then the one that preceded it, TECHNICAL ECSTACY. NEVER SAY DIE has to be Sabbath's mnost rock-oriented album. The catchy title track gets you on your feet before the bizarre \\"Johnny Blade\\" brings the listener into a mellow state. \\"Junior's Eyes\\" is my favorite song on the album. It is a catchy rocker that just gets you pumped up. \\"Hard Road\\" isn't bad, and \\"Air Dance\\" is by far the most interesting song on the album. I must note that during the making of this album, Ozzy left, and Dave Walker, from the original Fleetwood Mac, joined for a few months. They did not record, but made one live performace, and worked on \\"Junior's Eyes,\\" which there exists a rare recording of. Ozzy returned and got rid of all the Walker material and helped finsish the album. He would be fired from the band in early 1979, and be replaced with Ronnie James Dio.
B000062TU1|5.0|Being 18 and liking Harry Potter makes many of my peers laugh, but I don't care. Harry Potter is awesome for all ages. Having read all of the published books, I greatly anticipate each new movie. &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is the first installment in what is sure to be an acclaimed series. Owning the movie will start a collection that will be priceless someday. I definitley recommend this movie to all Potter fans and to those who are young at heart!
B0000683DH|5.0|Of the original &quot;Classic Star Trek&quot; movies made, Star Trek II has got to be number two on my all-time favorites (with &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; being number 1).  Originally slated as a two hour movie of the week, ST II is a fast paced, action oriented adventure that will hold your attention completely.<br />Montalban reprises his role from the original series as the genetically enhanced Khan.  In his original encounter with Kirk, he was a formidable advisary; by the time the events of ST II take place, his brilliance is tinged with the madness of a man bent on revenge.  Montalban brings his full talent as an actor to bear in his portrayal of Khan, making you draw back each time he appears on screen.<br />The original cast members reprise their various roles and each contribute to the progression of the story.  Shatner, Kelly and Nimoy garner the majority of the screen time; interestingly, this is Kirstie Alley's first break out role.<br />Holding true to the new &quot;director's edition&quot; DVD moniker, director Meyer has included several special features with this updated release.  Most notable among the features is the addition of the extra footage he added when ST II was rebroadcast on ABC's Movie of the Week during the mid 1980s.  While not showstopper sequences, they do add a more rounded perspective to an already finely detailed movie.  There are additional period interviews with Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley, as well as an in-depth look at how Industrial Light &amp; Magic created some of the key special effects sequences for the film.  The ILM footage is remarkable in many aspects, most particularly as there has never been a comprehensive &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look at how the Star Trek universe is created.
0446677450|1.0|..and I stick by my original review. I noticed a lot of Amway/Quixtar jargon in the 5-star reviews. <BR>5%, rat race, rut, stinkin' thinkin', go-to-school-get-a-good-job myth, just to name a few (wow, so original)<br />If you want to use this book for motivation, that's OK, I would think people would want hard facts to back up the author's claims of riches (oops, forgot, facts don't count). The attacks on 1-star reviews by MLM'ers are very tired and predictable from those who are desperately hoping their &quot;business&quot; will make them millionaires.<br />This book does give good basics (spend less than you make, asset/liabilites) but any financial book will give you that.<br />BTW - all my former &quot;retired&quot; uplines now have J-J-J-JOBS to support their &quot;interactive distribution&quot; business'.
B000088E6D|5.0|I saw this young man sing on NBC's Today Show.  It was wonderful and refreshing to hear this performer sing and I immediately went out to purchase his CD.  I had to go to four store as each one was sold out from people hearing him perform.  I finally located the last copy in one store and I couldn't be more satisfied.  This fellow is refreshing and if you miss the old pop music, like Jack Jones, Al Martino, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, you will absolutely love this CD.  I will be on the look out for his future CDs.  I would rate this CD, a magnificant (5) stars.
B0000508U6|5.0|If you're in the mood for some mellow, relaxing music after a hectic day or to listen to while soaking in a bubble bath, Coldplay is for you. When you put on &quot;Parachutes&quot; it takes you to another world and can easily put you to sleep with it's soothing qualities. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to relax and escape from the stresses of the world for an hour or so. Enjoy!
6305657947|5.0|What a fun movie, and a brilliantly produced DVD.  I've had this as part of my collection for some time now, and love to pull it out when I'm in the mood for a thrilling game of cat and mouse.<br />Brosnan and Russo are perfectly cast in this remake of the McQueen classic.  Departing from his customary Bond-esque delivery, Brosnan makes you believe in his world of high-finance (and high art).  Russo plays the insurance investigator/bounty hunter with a certain deliciousness for the chase that lesser actors would not be able to pull off.  Dennis Leary was a pleasant surprise in his supporting role as the detective working with Russo to bring in Brosnan.  His dry wit and &quot;been there, done that&quot; delivery puts the film into a believeable reality.<br />Although not as feature driven as some DVDs, this version does come with a fascinating commentary track from the director, John McTiernan.  If you a film buff, or just have a general curiosity regarding how movies are created, listen in to his discussion.  I found it a wonderful compliment to the film.
B00004Z400|5.0|The Deftones are amazing.  Every album sounds totally different yet exactly the same as their others.  It may not seem possible, but they do it quite well.  White Pony is more mellow than their prior two albums.  Not to say this slbum is soft- they still thrash like no others.  This CD deserves to be rocked over and over again.  Bonus: Cameo my Maynard from Tool.
B00006RU5B|4.0|When I first heard that Chris Cornell was teaming up with Brad, Tom and Tim of RATM, I was... well.. curious to say the least. Considering the fact that Soundgarden (and Cornell's only solo album Euphoria Morning) were totally on the different side of the hard rock spectrum than RATM I had no idea what they were gonna sound like. Then I heard &quot;Cochise,&quot; and it was the perfect combination of RATM and Soundgarden, except a totally new band. I heard the entire CD and it was really really good. Everyone, especially Cornell and Tom Morello, has evolved as musicians. Cornell returns to his aggressive vocal style, as well as his melodic side, and Morello delivers some heavy guitar riffs, and writes some very beautiful and melodic ones, something almost absent in RATM. <BR><br />People throw the name 'supergroup' around, but most supergroups don't sound nearly as inspired as this one. Sans a few throwaway songs (&quot;The Last Remaining Light,&quot; &quot;Light My Way&quot;) Audioslave's debut sounds completely inspired and fresh in the bland world of rock. And for those RATM fans who 'hate' this album because they supposedly 'got softer,' well you're wrong. Evolving as musicians does not make you sellouts or 'soft.' This is an entirely different band than RATM or Soundgarden. It has influences of those two bands, but this is something completely new, and hopefully they will be able to keep it going.
B00006CXXU|3.0|\\"Stripped\\" by Christina Aguilera isn't as good as I had hoped. The singles, \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Dirrty\\", and \\"Beautiful\\" are really the only good songs. All of the other songs are whiny ballads about her hard times. It's great that she can talk/sing about them but I don't really care. If you are a true Christina fan, which i'm not, then you'll probably enjoy the album. But if you are looking for songs that match the upbeat dance feel of \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Come on Over Baby\\", try Britney Spears.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u<BR> What could I say more than the fact that I have never been so impressed by such talented young performers as they are. t.A.T.u consists of two teenage girls of the ages now both 18, whom have been so controversial because of their hit song, \\"All the things she said\\". Mesmerizing the audience with their seductive, sexual need and want for one another, it has caused quite the uproar for those who disagree with these tactics due mostly to the age of when it all started. <BR> What the public does not understand is that their project is to lure the audience in a psycholdelic journey that displays the dark and light of life through the freedom of artistic expression. Somehow, a percentage of an audience has not grasped this theatrical perforance during their journey and instead, this same small percentage has created these negative speculations about the duo. The soon to be smaller percentage, disregards the fact that they have really been taken on a good ride to the point where it has become so believable leaving the audience to react and question everything. <BR> In essence, t.A.T.u should be praised just for these factors because if you listen to their whole cd, you, too, can find that cynical emotion that can be related to in your life at one point of time.<BR> t.A.T.u is doing a great job and I have nothing but total support for these girls for they have already made it BIG everywhere but the U.S. This is where I find it ironic because it is the U.S. who has done nothing but voice how artists have nothing but the right to express themselves freely especially through pure work of art. Because, that is what t.A.T.u is---ART! So, I think that it is time that people stop pretending that this is some sort of shock value to them and to move on and focus on the beautiful lyrics and the well formatted beats that their music has provided to those with the open mind.
B000066NW0|4.0|Im just writing to say that I think Avrils album is one of the best albums I've heard in a while. People being dissapointed because she isn't &quot; punk&quot; should open their ears a little bit more. So what if she isnt exactly punk, the album still outshines many others relased in the last couple of months. Songs like &quot; I'm with you&quot; and &quot;Anything but ordinary&quot; really stand out as the better tracks on the album,and of course &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8r boi&quot;<BR>Although I agree that there are some tracks on the album which could be improved lyrically, it is still entirly credible, as this girl isn't even 18 yet!<BR>If you havnt bought this album yet, and liked Complicated and Sk8r Boi..........what are you waiting for????
B00006M183|5.0|It has been well over 2 years since the seminal alternative rock band released `Binaural.' In that time, many Pearl Jam imitation acts have gained momentum (i.e. Creed, Nickelback) but those derivatives don't add up to the real thing. Also adding to the events, rock music witnessed the loss of Alice In Chains vocalist Layne Staley to an overdose in April 2002. This leaves Pearl Jam as the only band standing in the `grunge' movement of the early 1990s.<br />Now with the early 90s making somewhat of a comeback, with Nirvana's long-awaited `best of' compilation hitting stores, and former Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell teaming up with the 3 remaining members of Rage Against the Machine as Audioslave, `Riot Act' adds to the comeback. In many ways this is as comeback for Pearl Jam, for this marks their strongest set of songs since 1994's experimental `Vitalogy.'<br />Despite a title that sounds violent and one that suggests aggressive music, `Riot Act' is not aggressive the way most people would envision it. A lot of the songs are very melodic and straightforward, with its share of experimentation, showcased in songs like the dark, trippy `You Are' and the chant `Arc.'<br />The only `riotous' aspect of this album are Eddie's Vedder's introspective lyrics. Always known as an effective vocalist, Vedder may not howl as much as he used to, but his voice has improved with age. His lyrics are full of angst and personal situations. In `Love Boat Captain' he makes a reference to the 2000 Roskilde Festival in Denmark, in which 9 fans were trampled to death. Other lyrics are consumed with rage, regret and self-doubt, like in `Ghost' Vedder wails \\"It doesn't hurt when I bleed/But memories they eat me.\\" Also an outspoken political activist on views raging from a woman's right to choose and support for Presidential candidate Ralph Nader, Vedder attacks current President George W. Bush in the half-rock, half-spoken word song `Bushleauger,' saying that `He is not a leader.' The album's final track, `All Or None,' ends the album off in a bleak and pessimistic manner, with a somber jazz-groove written by guitarist Stone Gossard, and Vedder's lyrics and vocals being resonant as ever (`It's a hopeless situation/And I'm starting to believe/That this hopeless situation/Is what I'm trying to achieve').<br />Pearl Jam is a band that has considerably matured as time goes on, and will certainly become legends. `Riot Act' is another addendum to their influential and remarkable output, and proves that Pearl Jam has the longevity a lot of their alternative rock peers and followers do not have.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u. is one of the most amazing groups I think out there. They're down to earth and have an amazing sound. I can't stop listening to the cd it's sooo good. Who cares if they're lesbians all that matters is that their music sounds good and they appriciate their fans!!
B00005ASHM|3.0|&quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; - lyrics are sophomoric, but it's still a good one!<br />&quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; - will it ever end? Just when you think it will, it starts up again.<br />&quot;That's Not Me&quot; - horrible lyrics! And musically, not very good.<br />&quot;Don't Talk&quot; - drags a little, but good musically. Not very good, lyrically.<br />&quot;I'm Waiting For The Day&quot; - good arrangement.<br />&quot;Let's Go Away For A While&quot; - another good arrangement and one of the better compositions on the record.<br />&quot;Sloop John B&quot; - not their song, but a nice arrangement.<br />&quot;God Only Knows&quot; - possibly the best song on the album! Great melody, well written, good arrangement, nice counterpoint at the end.<br />&quot;I Know There's An Answer&quot; - this one is pretty well written, but it annoys me til it gets to the chorus.<br />&quot;Here Today&quot; - generally, I like this one musically, but, like many of the other songs on this record, the lyrics are extremely weak.<br />&quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; - not bad, but by this point on the album, everything starts to sound the same.<br />&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; - a real low point. If this song is so great, why doesn't Lawrence Welk get more credit?<br />&quot;Caroline, No&quot; - another of the best songs on the record.
B00005QZ2J|4.0|Let me first begin by stating that I feel L. Cohen, in addition to being my most personal of favorites, is truly one of the best poets and musicians ever.  So, friends, I'm biased!  But I shall do my best to give you Cohen rookies (for you are a rookie if you don't own this record) an accurate view of this album.  This is one of Cohen's strongest efforts, not unduly related to the fact that listening to &quot;Songs&quot;, and then comparing it to some of his later work, gives you an impressive feel for how he has matured and grown as an artist.  With that said, however, bear in mind that most modern artists will never reach the depth and maturity that Cohen has on this, his first album.  The poetry is very strong on &quot;Songs,&quot; and the grace of his words produces some of his most beloved songs: &quot;Suzanne,&quot; &quot;So Long, Marianne,&quot; and &quot;Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye.&quot;  Do not overlook the track &quot;The Stranger Song;&quot; it's a dark and brilliantly clever love song that sets the pace for some of his later, more post-modernist work (ie, &quot;The Future,&quot; &quot;I'm Your Man&quot;).  &quot;Teachers&quot; is another highlight; Cohen is truly at his best when you must listen very carefully to get all his points - rest assured, you are amply rewarded for listening.  For anyone considering checking into the most delightful and awe-inducing Mr. Cohen beyond a couple of albums (of which &quot;Field Commander Cohen&quot; and the initial &quot;Best of&quot; are great 'novice' fanfare!), this should be first on the list.  The poetry is heart-wrenching, his voice sincere, his heart in his throat.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album is awesome!  I would recomend it for any rocker, even if you are a younger fan of rock, metal, and punk rock!  The song &quot;Back In Black&quot; is great for anyone!  AC/DC is a great band of the 80's.  This is a great album for anyone who likes rock and likes older rock too!  You can't forget about the old rock bands!
6305508550|5.0|An amazing movie. This movie should be a prescribed &quot;study&quot; for business schools and Computer science science courses. Watching first 40 minutes of the movie was like watching my life...simply awesome and hilarous. I must have watched this movie like 50 times but every time I have enjoyed every second of it.
B000084T18|3.0|50 Cent's first album released since having attained massive name recognition does not disappoint.  You know what you're going to get, and, if you include the bonus cuts, you get 18 tracks' worth of it.  \\"It\\" is 50's lazy-yet-infectious flow over melodic-yet-rugged beats, with lyrical content ranging from macho posturing to macho posturing.  Anybody who would mention such output in the same breath as Illmatic, Ready to Die, Nation of Millions, or any other bona fide classic probably became a Hip Hop head five minutes ago when they first saw Eminem on MTV.<br />That said, this is a thoroughly entertaining album.  When the beats are hitting, which is the case on most tracks, 50's aforementioned flow riding the beat is enough to get your head nodding and keep you entertained.  Standout tracks include Don't Push Me, Many Men, and Back Down.  At this point, dissing Ja Rule is about as daring a move as 3rd Bass dumping on Vanilla Ice in \\"Pop Goes the Weasel,\\" but the beat is nice, and the disses are appropriately personal.<br />The downside to this album is that when the beats are lacking, the monosyllabic simplicity of 50's lyrical style and repetitive content aren't enough to carry a track.  One need only listen to P.I.M.P. to understand where I'm coming from.  Additionally, 50 is not a great singer, and so the fact that he insists on singing on every hook is unfortunate.<br />In sum, is you like 50, you'll like this, and if you don't, he's not going to convert you with Get Rich or Die Tryin'.  Then again, given that he sold a staggering 872,000 copies in less than a week, I doubt he's too worried about converts.  A little less singing, and the elimination of a few extraneous tracks would have tightened up the album, but in the final analysis, this is still worth copping.<br />3.5/5
B00005JKLZ|3.0|THE TIME MACHINE is a decent movie, but at 96 minutes, it seems too short for what could have been a film of epic proportions. The exploration of inventor/scientist Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pierce) wanting to go back in time to prevent a tragedy was intriguing, but it was too short lived and not explored enough and then even his venture into the future to witness an earth shattering global catastrophe was also too short lived. One interesting part of the film is his visit to a future New York City library where he interacts with a computerized/hologram librarian played by Orlando Jones (Mad TV, EVOLUTION). Then the story shifts gear to the original H.G. Wells plot line where he goes 800,000 years into the future and meets a humanoid race  called the Eloi and another race of underground dwellers called Morlocks who control the Eloi.  There is a pivotal scene in the film when the Morlocks emerge and attack the Eloi and it resembles a scene from the recent remake of PLANET OF THE APES.  The film becomes predictable from there.  The special effects are top notch, the direction is decent (by H.G. Wells great grandson, Simon Wells - - -a PR ploy if there ever was one!)and some pretty decent support roles by Mark Addy (THE FULL MONTY),pop singer Samantha Mumba, and a strange cameo in the last part of the film by Jeremy Irons as a mutant underground dweller made up to look uncannily like pop singer Edgar Winter. The \\"time machine\\" itself has been making the rounds being displayed at sci-fi and comic book conventions around the country and it is an impressive piece of movie prop. It is listed as one of the most expensive movie props ever constructed for a major motion picture. There was another film version of THE TIME MACHINE in 1960 directed by George Pal and starring Rod Taylor, Alan Young (tv's MISTER ED),and Yvette Mimieux.  Though dated, it is a classic piece of film making.
B000088E6D|5.0|In the wake of all of the re-issues of 50's and 60's so-called \\"lounge music\\" comes a disc that really does live up to this musical classification. Michael Bubl's incredibly agile vocals and smooth delivery recall the golden years of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. The performer, however, is not another copy cat artist; he has style, individuality, and a voice that defines the terms \\"polish\\" and \\"sophistication.\\" Do you relish Nelson Riddle's classic orchestrations? Then get ready for a unique treat!  The instrumental arrangements are nothing short of breathtaking. Buy this disc at once, and I guarantee that it will be locked in place on your CD player for months. These vocal stylings and performances blow Harry Connick out of the water!!
630179513X|2.0|Picking up right where the second movie leaves us Marty McFly learns that Doc has ended up in the old west of Hill Valley and now its up to Marty to get back to him to save his life. With the help of the Doc of 1955 Marty is able to get to the past and take on an old west thug nammed  \\"Mad Dog\\" Tannen. Besides taking on that gun slinging criminal , Doc has fallen in love with a school teacher named Clara who he has to tell the truth to about where he is from. If things weren't bad enough, the DeLorean has no gas and now they have to figure out a way to get back to the future again by getting the time machine to 88mph. Its a true wild west romp and it ends the trillogy in a decent mannor.<br />This movie sorta slows down the pace a bit , and unfortunatly I think a bit to much, when you look back at the two previous to this installment. It lacks the fun and newness of the first and the action and story of the second and pretty much turns into a second rate western with Back to the Future characters in the roles, with them trying to relive the idea of a kid from the 80s trapped in another time period like in the first film, but it just doesn't work for a 1880's setting. Bottom line, while it is a good movie at points, the fun just isn't here as it wants to be.<br />While not as good as the other two it does have its moments. The fun of seeing Doc's lab at the begining in 1955 which has a lot of the hidden jokes from the first within. Some good western jokes like him taking the name \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and a very exciting climax with a huge locomotive pushing the DeLorean on traintracks, all make this movie still worth it and a good one to watch.  Just don't expect the fun time traveling and characters that were in the other two. They stay trapped in the west for most of the movie and the amount of things that just seem to not make sense are very high in this movie. A lot of contradictions show up at various points to things that were well established in other movies (IE Not remembering who put Marty in the tacky clothing he winds up wearing). It is still a must have for anyone that is a fan of the Back to the Future series especialy as it just isn't complete without knowing how it ends or even a fan of a good movie to pass the time. Just don't expect to much as it doesn't deliever like the other two did with flying colors. It does end the trillogy on an up note and something that will make you smile and still want more. It will also make you wish they had more going on in 1985 at the end then the quick rushed ending they seem to come up with.  A fitting end none the less, just could have done much more then they wind up doing and at times it may even leave you unfullfilled.IE Not remembering who put Marty in the tacky clothing he winds up wearing).

B00006FDCJ|5.0|Clint Esatwood's masterpiece of film making give's us a look into the world of the charactor that he brought to life in the 60's,70's, and 80's. Basically the lead, William Munny,is no different than the Man With No Name that Eastwood gave us in his hayday. We get to see life after gunfighting.<BR>     Eastwood's Munny is an ex outlaw who goes out for one last run when a bounty is put on the head's of two cowboy's who one attacked a prostitute and cut her face. Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan one of <BR>Munny's partners who knew him befor Munny met his wife and changed his ways (In the beggining of the film we find out that Munny's wife has passed away).<BR>     The bounty is placed by the working girls of Big Whiskey a small town run by a ruthless and very nasty sheriff named Little Bill played by Gene Hackman (Hackman would win an Oscar for the role). We see just how nasty Little Bill can be when English Bob (Richard Harris) wounders into town looking to collect the bounty.<BR>     Eastwood showed real courage by not being afraid to show his charactor as both older and flawed. <BR>     One of the best thing's about this film is that you get to see the human side of all the people involved. Littler bill building a house and Munny raising pigs show just how diverse the charactors are.<BR>     This film won four Oscars including Best Film Editing, Supporting actor, Best Director (Eastwood) and Best Picture. Eastwood himself was also nomminated for best Actor. If you have never seen this film don't just rent it or see it on tv go out and buy it, you'll be glad you did.

Addenda: Why do they have the putrid sequel to his film listed as an 'essential video' while this one isn't?

B0000027EP|5.0|This was the album that Motorhead was nominated for a grammy for (they would lose the award to Metallica for the black album) and it is one of the best they ever produced. The sense of humor that Lemmy and the rest of Motorhead is lost on only the most uptight and there machine gun like delivery is a welcome listen considering the producer driven tripe that has been forced down our throats in the last few years. Song's like I'm so bad baby, I don't care and Angel City are funny enough to keep the album from becoming too dark with songs like  Like a Nightmare and the beautiful 1916. Going to Brazil may be the most fun on the entire album with it's good time rock and roll feel and it's powerfull delivery makes you wish it was longer, and the tribuite to the Ramones with R.A.M.O.N.E.S seem's very fitting in the wake of Dee Dee's and Joey's death's. This album delivers more than just the usual. 1916 proves to the world that Motorhead is not just another heavy metal band but a real musical force.
B00005TT77|3.0|...provided the only tracks I really liked on this disc.  The other tracks were fine and all, but I am not a big fan of the beatles.  I have Sgt. Pepper's, but I never listen to it anymore.  If I WAS a big fan, I wouldn't buy this, because tributes and covers of songs I like just make me want to listen to the originals.  <br />I listened to my roomate's copy of this because I saw that the three artists I listed above contributed songs.  Here is my review of those songs.<br />First is Chocolate Genius' take on \\"Julia.\\"  Chocolate Genius (Mark Anthony Thompson) is an artist I admire a lot, and one of my favorite songs of his is \\"My Mom.\\"  It's a song about how his mother didn't know who he was anymore as a result of alzheimer's disease.  He sings about how he'll go and see her, and they'll talk and spend quality time together, but she doesn't even know his name.  It is simple, direct, and touching.  It's fitting that he covered \\"Julia,\\" since the song was about Lennon's deceased mother, and he knows how Lennon felt.  Other people have posted that they hated what he did with the song, probably because he took liberties with it, but I feel it has real emotional impact.  The mood of the music is multifaceted, evoking sadness and loss, but also joy.  Well done.<br />Grandaddy's take on \\"Revolution\\" is another track that people seem to hate for not sticking to the original closely enough.  The original seemed too anthemic to me.  If the beatles would have taken a subtle approach, like Grandaddy's rendition, the song wouldn't have shown up in a commercial.  The snotty way Jason Lytle delivers the \\"well, no\\" makes me grin.  The band did a great job of injecting the song with their sound, and it comes off so well I would have thought it was a Grandaddy b-side if I never heard the beatles do it.  And being the young gun that I am, the first time I heard the original was in a commercial.<br />Not much to say about the Nick Cave track.  You either like his voice or you don't.  Ido, and though I don't think much of the song \\"Let it Be,\\" it is interesting to hear him take a stab at it.  It's kind of jarring, and also refreshing, to hear him crooning after listening to song after song of mostly lightweight artists with high voices trying their hardest to mimic the original tracks.  <br />A final note:  Does anyone else find it funny that Sean Penn's *mentally retarded* character in the movie was a beatles fanatic?  What does that say about people who really, really love the beatles?

0767802659|4.0|Starship Troopers could honestly use a few more likeable characters and a more convincing lead, but otherwise, this is as thrilling as movies come, a lightning-paced, hilarious rollercoaster ride of bullets, explosions, gore, raucous humor, and gratuitous nudity.  So yes, this is my kind of film, and I relished every minute of it.<br />Troopers is set sometime in the unnamed future, where South American society is apparently dominated by white, blandly attractive teens with Spanish last names, but look and sound distinctly American.  The whole things plays like a big satire on fasicism, as these teens graduate from high school and sign up as citizens.  Unlucky for them, signing up is almost a guaranteed death warrant, now that the humans have declared war on the Klendathu aliens from a distant star system, giant insectoid creatures that apparently feast on human flesh (once the soldiers get there, that is).  Thus, the movie chronicles the adventures of one such platoon, led by Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), who's assisted by pals Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) and Ace Levy (Jake Busey).  Massive chaos ensues.<br />A lot of people I know see this as a stupid movie.  An equally large amount of other people I know see this as a brilliant satire.  Both can nitpick or examine whatever stupidities or issues they want, I merely see this as a remarkable thrill ride.  On a pure popcorn level, Starship Troopers is easily one of the best sci-fi action films of the 90's (perhaps behind only Jurassic Park and Star Trek: First Contact), so deft as it is at blending action and comedy.<br />Oh, yes, Starship Troopers is a very funny movie, for all the right reasons, too.  The first hour is relatively sparse in action (actually, virtually none at all unless you count that over-the-top football game), but it's more than made up for by the first-rate humor.  Definitely the standout segment must be the training camp scenes, which manages to outdo Full Metal Jacket when it comes to sheer brutality and certainly surpasses it in dark, morbid humor.<br />The first half also nicely plays the introduction of our lead characters, some of whom make an impression and a lot of whom don't.  Casper Van Dien, the vapid, lantern-jawed actor that he is, is most certainly not a good actor, and while I could have gone with a more convincing lead, at least he does well during the action sequences.  Denise Richards is equally vapid as one-half of his love interest.  Faring far better is Dina Meyer, who's kick-... turn as Dizzy is a lot of fun.  Too bad she exits the film too early.  The adult cast is fun, too, especially Clancy Brown as the sadistic, yet caring Drill Sergeant Zim.<br />But Starship Troopers ultimately succeeds because of its action, and what magnificent action it is.  The second hour is like strapping yourself into a rollercoaster.  We're treated to harrowing, Zulu-style battle sequences in which our heroes are surrounded at all sides from ferocious, unstoppable enemies.   The action is blistering, bloody, and appropriately over-the-top.  It's from Paul Verhoeven, would you expect any different?  <br />Starship Troopers succeeds because it's great fun, boosted by awesome special effects and a great score from Basil Poledouris.  I'd sure love to see a sequel, but judging from the box office take, such an option may never see the light of day.  Still, a must see for action fans.

B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael Jackson is definitely one of the most powerful (and controversial) figures in popular music. Aside from the alleged sex abuse scandals, plastic surgery and countless other stories about him, he's made some of the most enduring music to be heard. _Thriller_ and _Bad_ are certified classic albums released during the 1980s. Entering the 1990s, he makes an updated, funky, catchy and addictive album with loads of dance grooves - without losing any of the emotion, passion and sincerity he always injects into his music. However, with the updated production, it still sounds like Michael Jackson...with all those hypnotic vocal nooks and crannies found lurking in many of the tracks, period!<br />Songs like \\"Jam,\\" \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\" and \\"Can't Let Her Get Away\\" are so funky and downright exciting and energetic, they should get many lovers of energetic dance grooves jumping. Sex-tinged numbers like \\"In The Closet\\" and \\"She Drives Me Wild\\" show off Michael's latent sexual interests. There's also diversity to be found (Michael always possessed a certain diversity.) Slower, poignant numbers like \\"Heal The World\\" and \\"Will You Be There\\" are almost certain to tug at your emotions. The former is mainly a \\"wordly\\" pop anthem with it's earthy, mellow melody. All this changes when the choir comes in near the end of the song and a pattern of two semitones are increased from the standard, backing keys twice during the song. The vocal/choiral crescendos send shivers down my body. The latter track some will recognize from the movie \\"Free Willy.\\" Like the former track, it mostly begins softly featuring Michael's plaintive vocals, exotic percussion and the hushed vocals of a choir. Later, you know it'll progress to an emotional high, as Michael goes through this passionate and almost crying vocal performance, backed by the heavenly choir in full-effect by now. Both these tracks nearly send me to tears.<br />\\"Black Or White\\" is the big hit of the album featuring Slash (Guns N' Roses) on guitar. \\"Who Is It\\" has a somber atmosphere combined with a forcefulness that is downright sexy, and \\"Give Into Me\\" is a passionate, intense and smothering number featuring some keyboards (if not synthesizers) and fiery guitar licks.<br />I've always admired Michael Jackson and the music he's made, even with all the scandals, rumors and other stories that have bogged the airwaves.

B000021YQV|3.0|This is not easy for me.  Giving a band that I really admire and listen to atleast once everyday three and a half stars is hard, but I figured that I just had to say this.<BR>     Now, do not get me wrong.  'Toxicity' does have some really amazing works.  Aerials, (Although its been overplayed on every radio station) Forest, Chop Suey, and Deer dance are all spectacular.  However, let me point out the bad songs:  Prison Song, Needles, Bounce, Shimmy, Jet Pilot...it goes on like this!  Why did Prison Song sound like it was recorded over horrible speakers?  Why Did needles have sloppy guitar riffs?  Why did Jet pilot have to be so repetitive?  Why did Shimmy have to be so predictable and tiring?  Why did bounce have to be so much like Shimmy, predictable, tiring, as well as old and used!?  Now, I remember first hearing their Self Titled and loving it.  Afterwards, I listened to it atleast once every day for about two years.  When I decided to get Toxicity, I expected the same kind of music.  SOAD has changed.  Changed for the better?  If they can do great songs like Forest, Chop Suey, Aerials and Science, then they just might release a great album next.  However, if they continue to do first recorded songs such as Needles or Prison song, then they might die out in my book.  I really hope they don't, and although I have a feeling that I'll always be an avid fan, I'm really dissapointed that I have a System CD in which I have to skip over six songs out of fourteen.  Spycho was more than wonderful, yes.  Forest was melodic and pulsatingly talented, showing System at their best.  Aerials took on that Spiders feel that you have to respect.  Chop Suey was dark and an abstracted song in which you could either view it as a religiously connected song or a personal poem.  Science took on a Slayer feel, and when Serj says, 'Spirit Moves through all things' the Song blows me away.  However, if you liked the Self Titled and have not yet picked up Toxicity, buy Steal this Album before going onto this one.  System did, in my opinion, kind of fall into that sophomore slump.  They can, of course, get out of it musically if they try really hard. I hope they do, man I hope they do...<BR>     However, Toxicity was good.  If you have never tried them before, though, then don't pick this album up.  Pick up the other two first.  Please.

0451197968|4.0|This was as really fun, fast read. It is not very long so you can read it in about an afternoon or if you are a slower reader, a day or two. Dont be fooled by the movie, this book is very very different. Other than the name Ben Richards and the fact that there is a game show in the book, it is very different.  This is the fourth of Stephen King's \\"Bachman Books\\".  If you pick this up because of King's name on the front you may be a little let down.  I say this because writing as Bachman, his style is much different.   This is not a horror story in the least bit, but more of a sci-fi thriller.  We follow Ben Richards in this book, as he tries to win money for his family on a gameshow where, you win, or you die. If you can stay a fugitive for more than 30 days, then you win. But this is not easy, and nobody has ever won the game.  The game gives you 24 hours to flee from the law to wherever you want to go, then the gameshows \\"henchmen\\" take chase.  Every page of this book is a thrill ride, which will keep you turning them until the end.  \\"The Running Man\\" along with all the other \\"Bachman Books\\" are a blessing and show King's true talent as the world's best selling author.  This book has an ending that will leave you with your mouth wide open, prepare yourself. Great Book. Go Stephen King, err... Richard Bachman.
0440237688|5.0|\\"The Giver\\", this is a very well written book. I like it because it makes you think about your own society. It made me think about many things, that's why it is a good book. There were many details about everything that happened. The people of that community were so immersed in there society that they didn't know what they were missing, a lot of the things we as a society take for granite. For example the color they didn't see that. Then again that's what we as a society are trying to do overlook people's differences so that everyone is treated equal, but we try and take into consideration people's differences. In conclusion this book has great feeling that most of the characters of this great book did not have.<br />Good job, Mr. Lowry
B00005JLD4|4.0|I could recall the days when we were taught about the \\"stolen generations\\" in our high school in Australia.  It is definitely not a proud chapter in Australia's history & the Government does not wish to sweep it under the carpet & forget about it simply.  Rather, we were taught of the nation's past, lest we forget & then, we can make sure that the Australia of the future shall never be the same again.  It's really unbelievable and inconceivable that the Government of that time really believed that the assimmilation program was the best thing that could happen to the half caste children.  The notion of freedom & individual rights is definitely not considered then.  The premise of the runaway girls to return to their home is both disturbing and moving at the same time, amid the vast & hostile landscape of Australia, and the police that were hot on their trails.  Kenneth Branagh was simply brilliant as the Protector of the Aborigines, who was also called the Devil by the children.  But the stars of the show would have to be those runaway girls who were so natural with their roles.  Noyce, the Director has proven that you don't need to have a big budget to create a powerful and poignant movie.  To these days, land rights are still fought between the Aborigines and the Australian Government, and the living condition of the Aborigines is as bad as the Third World countries or worse.  There is simply a huge gap between their living standard against the rest of Australia, and we wondered have we done enough for them?  Afterall, they are the first settlers of Australia and shouldn't the Government pay more attention to them instead of diverting its attention to a war far away in Iraq?
0805062971|5.0|Like everyone else, after watching Fight Club the movie i had to watch it again just to get everything. I bought the book mainly beacuse i loved the story by Chuck Palahniuk. I've read his other works (Survivor ect) and although they are good, they are lacking when compared to Fight Club. Also just beacuse you've seen the movie doesn't mean that you've got the entire story, the book gives you additional information that really explains certain aspects of the movie. If you haven't read the book, do so! it definatly worth owning
B0000640VO|4.0|This feel-good movie captivated me right from the beginning.  Audrey Tautau is splendid in her role as Amelie, &amp; she carried the weight of the movie brilliantly.  The basis of the story was simple &amp; straight-forward, that they were many lost souls that needed to be saved, &amp; one day, Amelie decided that she would be THAT saviour.  The movie explained to us Amelie's deprived happy childhood &amp; as she grew up, she was a bit of an introvert &amp; she had difficulty in fitting in.  By doing those charitable deeds, Amelie redeemed herself &amp; she felt a sense of rejuvenation.  Deep down, though, she's still a lonely soul herself.  As the saying goes, what goes around comes around.  Those that she helped, they decided to help her in return &amp; they reminded her about the necessity of taking a risk to change her life for the better.  In other words, she's entitled to be happy just as much as they do, &amp; the ending doesn't disappoint.  The two hours spent is probably THE most wonderful two hours I spent this year.  Highly recommended.
B00004SAIQ|5.0|While \\"Strangers in the Night\\" was a great showcase for how great the Schenker edition of this band could be, their studio albums were inconsistent and always included a couple of weak songs. Not so this one. This album has ferocious rockers, a good ballad or two, and finishes off with a great instrumental to cool you down. Michael Schenker is brilliant on this album, and the production is solid (also unlike most of their other albums). Get it... The closest thing to a must-have there is \\"Between the Walls\\", so you have to let how bad you need this be decided by how much you love UFO. A UFO fan should not be without this album.
B000002KGT|5.0|Albums generally do not become classic 20 years after they are released.  They become classic a few years after their release, and their reputation continues to build from there.  Such is the case with \\"Rumours\\".  When this album was released in 1977, it was the eclectic combination of rapid pop songs such as \\"Second Hand News\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" combined with surreal Stevie Nicks' songs like \\"Dreams\\" that created an album that was able to realize the artistic ambitions of rock music.<br />You could write a review only on the range of music on this CD.  Given the number of artists collaborating on this album, you get a blues and country influenced song, \\"Never Going Back Again\\".  There are lush orchestrated rock songs with strong blues influence like \\"Don't Stop\\".  The quiet ballad \\"Songbird\\" sounds as though it would be at home in a lounge.  \\"The Chain\\" with a strong bass backbeat shows influences from metal to blues.  There are songs like \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" that would fit as easily into a country album as a rock album.  \\"Oh Daddy\\" is another ballad that could be almost anything, but has elements of an abusive relationship.  A dark, foreboding song.  \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" is another dark song, poetry and surreal images, rock as art as it can be.<br />The very range of elements, and the excellence with which they are achieved, are why this album became great.  Even though the album was recorded 25+ years ago, the variety and skill of execution plays well today, and allows a new listener to understand why this album is considered one of the greats.<br />Generally I spend a significant amount of time going into what each song contributes, and how the music was performed and so on.  However, this album is one of the few that requires little explanation.  There are few albums that rise to the level of art that is readily accessible (as an example, I also consider R.E.M.'s \\"Automatic for the People\\" in this same category).  This album is one of those.  If you appreciate rock when it becomes art, and the great music in general, you must have this for your collection.te rock when it becomes art, and the great music in general, you must have this for your collection.
B00000JMQE|1.0|To be honest, I've only watched this movie twice. Once at the age of *4* when my dad took me to see it at the theater. I VIVIDLY remember leaving there screaming like a bat out of hell and crying. The second time I saw it on tv 3 years ago. This movie is scarry as all hell even now. Visions of heads in curio-cabinets really messed me up as a child and even now looking back on it I've got goosebumps. This movie was messed up. I'm definantly renting it for movie night tonight with my friends LOL. OMG...wheels for hands! Why did I come to this site??? LOL
B00005JKLZ|3.0|We get to ask a question in this movie that seems to plague our movie industry:  Just because you can make a movie over again, should you?  In the case of this movie, the original was made in 1960 and starred Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, Alan Young and Sebastian Cabot and is now considered a classic George Pal movie.  The special effects then, as now, were state of the art and brilliantly accomplished.  Furthermore, the central theme of the story then was the promise of mankind and civilization, and George's desire to be a part of the propagation of mankind.<br />The story:  Instead of George Wells being the central character, we have Guy Pearce, who you might recognize from \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\", playing Alexander Hartdegen, an inventor who notes in an off-handed way that he knows a clerk by the name of Einstein who has \\"good ideas\\".  Alexander has always been a misfit, as most geniuses are, and when his fiance tragically dies, he feels guilty and drives to create a time machine.  He accidentally ends up in a far future where the moon has been destroyed, which caused the destruction of civilization, and the subsequent evolution into Eloi, Morlocks, and a being that controls the Morlocks.<br />The real star of the movie is the special effects.  The village where the Eloi live is very creative.  The art of the Eloi is stunning.  The underground scenes in the Morlock caverns are suitably dark and forbidding.  However, while the Morlocks are bigger and scarier than the 1960s Morlocks, I found the 1960s version more believable.  Smaller size is an advantage in the underground.  Sensitivity to light is a natural side-effect of underground living.  Furthermore, if the Morlocks has lived underground for millennia, then their eyes would have evolved to see better in dim light conditions, which should have made them much less tolerable of outside light.  Of course the implausibilities stretch even further than that, with Morlocks performing physical feats that seem to defy physics as we know it, and how does that time machine always seem to end up above ground on a flat spot?<br />I was also less pleased with Hartdegen's motivations.  George's motivations in the original were the destiny of mankind and the goal of civilization.  Hartdegen's motivations seem to be to find a woman and settle down creating huge three dimensional sculptures in the far future.  The equivalent in the present would be that someone creates a device that changes society for all time to come, and their goal was to buy a double wide and be able to drink a six-pack a night, while not having to work.<br />I was expecting an intelligent thought-provoking movie equivalent to the 1960 version.  Instead I got a fairly mindless action adventure movie that had all of the flaws of the original with all new flaws added.  While the special effects are excellent, they do not overcome the weak plot.  I was somewhat disappointed.  This movie turns out to be a one-time watch that requires you to disengage your brain before watching.  Three stars for what should have been an improvement over the original.efy physics as we know it, and how does that time machine always seem to end up above ground on a flat spot?<br />I was also less pleased with Hartdegen's motivations.

B00004RFFI|3.0|Like others, I was horrified to witness the convoluted, \\"spiraling out of control\\" spectacle of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton dribbling on and on about their silly relationship. Far more deadly than any tornado I've seen. Not to mention that I had forgotten just how bad Phillip Seymour Hoffman could be. By the way, is this now the standard criterion for cheeseball Hollywood flicks - the resident staple disheveled wacko techno nerd? Personally, I don't need this character unless he's pulled off with aplomb (like the brilliant Steve Buscemi (sp?))<br />The major problem with movies like this (that are action or disaster packed) is that one would like to be pulling for the humans and wanting them to survive, instead of pulling for the disaster to sweep them all away. Yes, the special effects were sometimes fun...<br />One could blame it all on the bad script writing - which is surely justified - but Paxton is such a goofball that he probably would have flucked up a solid script.<br />I give it three stars for the visuals and sound when the actors were not speaking.

B000084T18|5.0|...this CD is HOT!!! 50 Cent is an awsome rapper. This is what rap really should sound like. Eminem, and Dre. are by far the smartest people for signing this guy to their label. I'm telling you if 50 Cent makes CDs like this than Rap will be all good again. This guy kinda reminds me of 2Pac. All the songs on this CD is really good. The guy is so awsome with Eminem also in some of his songs. Some of his lines are funny, and some are deep. And some are just catchy. 50 Cent is what RAP should be. I hope he keeps this up, becuase ever since 2Pac and NOTORIOUS died, Rap has sucked. But if we have rappers like 50 and Em, rap might be the BEST again!!!
B00006LIRI|3.0|Let's get this straight. This CD in no way represents the best of U2 in the 90's. . <br />Okay let's get into it. The CD's first misstep is the inclusion of a sub-par mix of Mysterious Ways were Bono mumbles the worlds at a key point in the song. Somebody must have grabbed the wrong master or something. Anway, bad omen. <br />The inclusion of the Electrical Storm is ok. It just isn't a \\"best of\\" single exactly, so probably not the best move on their part. <br />Then comes the first re-mix. The new version of Gone is just well, fantastic. This should have been released as the new single, just as the Sweetest Thing was remixed for the 80's best of. <BR> <BR>Moving on., the Hands That Built America just seems out of place. The actual movie mix of this track is much better, but even so. Not really worth buying the disc for. <br />Discotheque is the first obvious reworking of history. The moment that made this song worth it's silliness was yanked in the remix (the boom-ya after the bridge). Now the song falls flat on it's face. I think the band was a bit embarrassed about it's excesses in the 90's and is trying to pretend they didn't happen. I wish this remix didn't happen. <BR> <BR>The new mix of Staring At The Sun is ok, but this was another week single to begin with. <BR> <BR>The new mix of Numb is just as bad as the old mix. This song was never very strong and it amazes me it was ever released in the first place. <br />Okay, what's missing. The Fly and Wild Horses were both very strong singles that didn't make it. The Fly actually made the UK version of this CD for some reason. The title track to Zooropa is missing. While not the strongest single, it compares really well to Numb. From Pop I can't believe they left off the best track on the whole disc, Please. But let's not forget the worst omission, The Ground Beneath Her Feet from the Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack. This is one of their best songs ever. How did songs like Staring at the Sun replace it? Beats me. <br />Looking back over the 90's it's truly amazing how lackluster the decade really was for U2 in comparison to the 80's. Not that I mind, I really enjoyed their experimentation. I am sort of upset that they returned so obviously to their original sound lately.
B00005KHJR|2.0|\\"The Wicker Man\\" is yet another cult film that delivers much less than it promises. The problem is that the director - despite being the writer's friend! - doesn't understand how to turn a script that's almost all atmosphere and \\"suggestion\\" into an effectively scary film.<br />A Sturges or Mankiewicz script has almost everything spelled out in the dialog; even an incompetent director couldn't totally ruin it. But a mystery/horror film that builds to a surprise ending needs to start that build at the very beginning and not let up. \\"The Wicker Man\\"'s direction is far too flat and literal for this to occur. And when the trap is sprung (so to speak) at the end, the film slogs to its conclusion, rather than rushing to its violent shock ending.<br />\\"The Wicker Man\\" would have been far more effective had it had been directed by Jacques Tourneur, who repeatedly demonstrated he knew how to scare an audience without actually showing anything. Take, for example, \\"Curse of the Demon.\\" Even without the \\"literal\\" beginning and ending tacked on by the producer, the film is creepily suggestive and even frightening, even though we see little of the supernatural - until the end.<br />Another good example is \\"Mimic.\\" The basic idea is so preposterous that the film can work only on atmosphere - and del Toro delivers. The build-up is so effective that we accept the ridiculous, biologically impossible monsters when they appear.<br />The two-disk \\"Wicker Man\\" set contains the heavily cut theatrical release on the first disk, along with an excellent documentary about the making of the film. The transfer is crisp, with very clean, natural color. The second disk is the longer, less-heavily-cut cut, with the deleted scenes inserted from a 1\\" videotape transfer of that version. The insertions are plainly visible, with no attempt to sharpen the image or correct the color balance.<br />The deluxe set comes in a nice wooden box. Perhaps, when your pet gerbil dies, you could put him in the box and incinerate it.and incinerate it.
B00005KB9X|5.0|Natty Dread is a masterpiece.  Every song has a message, and every song can be listened to over and over again.  Nobody in music can compare to Bob's brilliance.  Natty Dread is surely an album that will live on forever.
B00003CXCW|5.0|There is truth in Norma Desmond's assertion - \\"I *am* big - it's the *pictures* that got small!\\" We're living in the Platinum Age of acting - there have never been so many truly gifted actors around...<br />\\"Sunset Boulevard\\" (strictly speaking, the title is \\"Sunset Blvd.\\") isn't one of them. It comes about as close to absolute perfection as one can imagine.<br />There is personal irony in Norma's remark that \\"We didn't need [no stinking] dialog  - we had faces!\\" Although Gloria Swanson was a major silent star who didn't make the transition to talkies, her turn as Norma Desmond is one of the great performances of sound films. It is superbly subtle and nuanced - not the one-note, over-the-top perfomance you might expect.<br />\\"Sunset Blvd.\\" is one of those rare films in which a sex scene would actually help the story. Unfortunately, it was made while the Production Code was still active, so Billy Wilder could only suggest what was unshowable. He does very well, especially when Joe attempts to comfort Norma after her attempted suicide and her \\"claws\\" drag Joe toward her.<br />Note the subtle humor in Norma Desmond's address - 10086 Sunset Boulevard. In restaurant lingo, \\"86\\" means \\"It's spoiled\\" or \\"We're out of it.\\" (That's why Maxwell Smart was Agent 86.) As a verb, to \\"86\\" something means to cancel or terminate it.<br />Music lovers will appreciate that Franz Waxman had the good sense to steal from Richard Strauss. The first theft occurs when Betty leaves and Joe looks up at Norma on the balcony-we hear the opening notes of the opera, as the guard gazes at Salome, with whom he's obsessed. The second occurs near the end, after Norma has gone mad and is sitting at her mirror. Waxman quotes the \\"Salome's madness\\" chords when someone says the camera crew has arrived.<br />\\"Sunset Blvd.\\" could be remade-Willaim Shatner is rapidly approaching the loopiness needed to do a creditable job as \\"Norman\\" Desmond. (Please - no comments about weird movie characters named Norman.)<br />The DVD transfer is exquisite, with rich blacks, clean whites, and wonderful range of gray tones. It's far superior to the mediocre laserdisk version.<br />The DVD transfer is exquisite, with rich blacks, clean whites, and wonderful range of gray tones.

B000002B7S|4.0|To the casual listener, the only track off this CD that may ring a bell is the title track.  However, the entire CD is great.  Some thought that Ozzy's career was over when Randy (not Johnny!!!) died, but Jake E. Lee does a respectable job filling in.  He's no Randy, but still a talented guitarist.  For those of you who've never been exposed to this masterpiece, here's what I think of each song -<br />Bark at the Moon: One of Ozzy's greatest, and by far Jake's greatest guitar offering.  Speed, killer riffing, and two great solos combine to make this an excellent song. A<br />You're No Different: A \\"keyboard ballad\\" that I like very much. Not much guitar, but a great song, nonetheless. A-<br />Now You See It: Probably my least favorite on the CD.  It just seems that something is missing in this track, it is not fast enough or something. C+<br />Rock and Roll Rebel: A great song with some great riffing by Jake.  I like the tempo of the verses; they move along well. B+<br />Center of Eternity: Yet anoither killer song from this album.  A cool beginning, followed by some furious shredding on Jake's part, plus Ozzy's blistering vocals all combine for a great track. A-<br />So Tired: Ozzy has a sentimental side? Sniff, sniff, I love this song.  It's mostly vocals, but it's a good song. B+<br />Slow Down: This song hits you in the face right off the bat. Ozzy's vocals make this a sort of cheery song.  Very melodic. A-<br />Waiting For Darkness: A slower, more eriee song that is... darkness.  Perfect Ozzy, the lyrics meshing with the background bass and guitar. A-<br />Spiders in the Night: Well, not every album ends with a great song... C<br />While not as guitar-focused as the first two albums, \\"Bark at the Moon\\" is still great in its own right, and much better than \\"The Ultimate Sin\\", which also features Jake E. Lee.  I'd give this 4 1/2 stars if possible.
0441172717|5.0|One of the landmark novels in science fiction, Dune is worthy of its rank as a classic.  Prior to its appearance in the mid-1960s, few science fiction novels even approached its level of depth.<br />The story, which follows Paul Atreides and his growth into the messianic Muad'Dib, is rich in detail.  There is a feudalistic galactic empire with all the attendant political intrigues.  There are numerous religious movements, some operating more scientifically, others quite mystically.  And there is the subtle character of the planet Arrakis (or Dune) itself, whose hostile environment, precious spice resources and devastating sandworms make it not only the most important planet in the galaxy, but also arguably the most interesting planet in science fiction.<br />There is too much here to detail in one review.  While it is not perfect - Herbert does have his writing flaws - the imperfections pale in comparison to the importance of this novel to the genre.  Just as the Lord of the Rings is an essential fantasy read, this book is a must read for any science fiction fan.

B000068PQ0|5.0|For once, you can believe the hype. This album is one of the best recorded in 2002, blending techno and pop rock like no other band can (except maybe Radiohead). Very experimental, very thick, and very enjoyable. I give it five stars simply because I can't see any major flaws. If you like this, also check out anything by Wilco.
B000021YQV|5.0|If you havn't heard Da system at their max, this Cd is the way to go. This CD is where Da System became famous. The highlights include \\"Toxicity\\" (this song rocks!!!) \\"Chop Suey\\" (This song will shape you into a headbanger!!) and \\"Aerials\\" (this song may be slower but it ends the cd with your jaws dropped and wanting the other System CD's) You will always charish this album nomatter how old ya get. I've had the cd for 2 years and It still is my favorite cd including my favorite songs and ARTIST!!! I love this CD and I think you will too!
B00005JLRR|1.0|Just caught the screening of this movie... One and a half hours of my life that I will never get back. All the glitz cannot hide just how bad this movie is. This would have to be the worst Star Trek movie ever made, including the much over rated Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan.<br />There was absolutely no story line in this movie, consequently anyone with an attention span greater than 2 minutes will find this movie utterly boring.
0679805273|5.0|I recieved this book as a gift from my father when I was in High School. I read it over and over so many times I had it memorized. Now when I read it to my son I can show him the pictures and even turn the pages without even looking. This book has inspired me to keep trying when I fail and to believe in myself.
B00007E8V4|4.0|I've been a huge fan of SOAD since their first album. What attracted me to them was their completely original sound. There was no mistaking them. Toxicity had the same effect, very experimental stuff that I really enjoyed. There are quite a few songs on here I like, but there's a couple horrible parts.<br />I'll start with the good in no particular order. Chic-N-Stew. A great song they've been playing live for years, very happy it made it on to a record. Very original and the lyrics are funny. <br />Bubbles has a nice little flavor. Darron's voice complements this song. He doesn't do such a great job in Roulette. He completely ruined that song for me, but it does contain a pretty sweet little solo, which isn't that common for a SOAD song.<br />F**k the System, very quirky, very System, and it sounds good. I like it a lot.<br />Innervision is great lyrically and muscially. Very solid.<br />Ego Brain has a nice, haunting melody, and some Black Sabbathish vibes to it.<br />Thetawaves is a bit repetative, has some cliched SOAD guitar work, and mediocre vocals. Some parts have their merit though.<br />The intro to Mr. Jack is the intro to Spiders. I'm guessing they had to choose between this song and Spiders on their first album. Same idea. There is some very cool harmony in the intro though not found in  Spiders though. Spiders is a bit better, I think. I can't take the name &quot;Mr.Jack&quot; seriously.<br />Now the bad. ADD. I was SO disgusted when I heard this. SOAD managed to sound like every other band out there with this one. They nailed the nu-metal vibe. Congratulations. As a nu-metal song, it's perfect. As a SOAD song, it's filth.<br />All the other songs I left I felt weren't really worth mentioning either because they were a bit below average, average, or just filler.
B00005JHCP|5.0|What a treat this movie was!  Especially seeing Daniel Radcliffe's first role here before he hit puberty!  I was also pleasantly surprised to see Maggie Smith (she plays Professor McGonagall in the Harry Potter movies) here as well; she was excellent as David Copperfield's no-nonsense, but loving, caring great-aunt.  I laughed at Betsy's crowing *No donkeys here* to shoo away the donkeys from her yard.  Daniel did a wonderful, shining job here as young David Copperfield; you can actually tell David's really suffering under his cruel stepfather's rule and Daniel does a fine job portraying the anguish. Daniel really did a good job with the weeping scenes, esp. when he cries at the scene of finding out that awful Murdstone's his new stepfather; you can actually see tears in his big eyes.  I just loved the sad-eyed, slanted-browed look Daniel perfected in this movie; it made me just want to hug him.  Daniel's sooo cute and I love how dramatic he is!  The scenes were historically accurate too, esp. the blacking factory and the debtors' prison and the squalor of those places is very vivid too.  They do a good job also making Daniel a nice mess working in the blacking factory and when he arrives at his aunt Betsy's house; you could see that poor David's been through hell and back.  Just seeing this movie endears me to Daniel Radcliffe even more; Daniel's a very interesting person I'm curious about. Well done!

The additional cd contains the lost \\"Big Tears\\" which Costello explains should have been included in the original album. Also in the second cd are live versions and a cover of the Damned \\"Neat Neat Neat\\". This album and the half dozen or more to follow were among the most influential music being made by the Punk/New Wave . Great stuff.

I have loved Fleetwood Mac my entire life and never though in a million years I could be happy with live versions of their best, but older songs.  Boy was I wrong.<br />Time cast a spell on this group and they were able to use their growth and experience over the years to actually improve upon their best songs.  WOW!<br />Not only do they look great...especially Christine, but they some better than ever.<br />Some musical standouts...Silver Springs.  This song never got the attention it deserved so it particularly nice to see that is front and center in this concert.<br />Bleed To Love Her from Lindsay Buckingham is a truly awesome love song.<br />This is Fleetwood Mac at its very best.

B00005NVDF|3.0|Not on the level of Annie Hall or Manhattan, but it’s still good. &#34;Play It Again, Sam&#34; is not perfect, but it is entertaining, and it has some big laughs, especially when Woody Allen’s character tries to drink alcohol and he spits it out. That reminded me of Annie Hall, when he sneezes a hefty supply of a certain drug. Definitely worth seeing for fans of Mr. Allen's work.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Marvel is just swimming in money,especially Stan Lee. From the Blade movies to Spider-man. Now, here we are with Daredevil. When I go to the theaters, I saw tons of people in line and a bunch of SOLD OUT signs on the showtimes, so I kind of figured the movie would be a box-office,sold out hit, and it was.<br />When I first heard that Ben Afleck was casted as Matt Murdock(DD),I kind of had my doubts about it. I do like Ben Afleck, but I just couldn't see him as a blind man, super-hero, jumping from building to building kicking the [stuffing] out of villains. But, as I was watching the movie, my view on Afleck changed. I can now see him as Daredevil.<br />Anyways, the movie is about a man named Matt Murdock, who when he was a boy, got a chemical accident sprayed into his eyes, causing him to go blind, but enhancing his 4 other senses, to make them a radar. So, of course, he's got to grasp his abilities, learn them, and harness them. After we see him as a boy, we then see Matt Murdock fighting crime in Hell's Kitchen as Daredevil. <br />The villains in the movie, were not in the movie that much and you couldn't really get the feel for them. Elektra barely had any screen time to show off her skills, and Bullseye's fights and razzle,dazzle sharp throwing skills were really short. I really didn't care that Kingpin was black. But, he was the villain with the shortest screen time. I was very surprised in this, because Kingpin is big time in the comics! Casting Micheal Clarke Duncan as Kingpin, didn't bother me at all, because, who else are you gonna get? He's the only huge actor that fits body structure and strength of the Kingpin.<br />Overall, I thought Daredevil was a pretty good, comic book movie. The actings was o.k. and the story line stuck with the movie.After seeing the end and the scene during the credits, I could already tell that Daredevil 2 will be coming out. Let' just hope with all the other comic book hero movies like X-Men 2,The Hulk,Amazing Spider-Man,and the rumored Fantastic 4 and Iron Man, that if they make another Daredevil, that it wont be flushed out and boring because of all the super-hero movies.
0060278250|5.0|I thought this book was one of the best in it's series. I loved how the auther had the little twist in the end. This book made me cry and laugh. I abosutly loved it. Even if you aren't usually into fantasy this will bring you in. Garth Nix is a great writer.
0316666343|3.0|I was SO excited to read this book, the concept sounded so amazing to me.  But I must admit, once I had the book and began reading, it was not as I pictured at all.  I struggled to complete the book which was not what I expected at all.<br />The characters seemed unreal to me and although the author tried to get you in &quot;their shoes,&quot;  I just couldn't &quot;feel&quot; for them, like I wish I had been able too.<br />I'd say its worth the read just for the concept, but the whole time you spend thinking; &quot;I could have wrote this so much  better.&quot;
0380977788|4.0|Lately I have been enjoying sorting through the bumper crop of kids' books, looking for that perfect gift for young relatives. This turned out to be one I can recommend, though with certain reservations.<br />It is a simple, even archetypal, story:<BR>  1. Child is unhappy with some aspect of her life<BR>  2. Child is suddenly offered everything she ever wanted<BR>  3. Offer turns out to be too good to be true and child is threatened by evil forces<BR>  4. Child battles evil and, by discovering new strengths in herself, saves herself and others<BR>  5. Child realizes she already had the ideal world in her regular life and lives happily ever after<br />Along the way Gaiman manages to paint some disturbing but vivid images (the black-button eyes of the \\"other parents\\"); creative details (Coraline busying herself by tallying up every blue item in their flat); and quirky characters that give this world life and keep it from being a trite rendition of the same old same old.<br />It's probably precisely because the story is so well-drawn overall that I'm mystified by what is left hanging and undeveloped. Where did this \\"other mother\\" come from? Where does she go? What about the cat, or the talking mice, or the stone? What is this other world, anyway, and how is it connected with our own? Only the most cursory explanations are given. The creepiest part of the book, the rats' songs, turns out to be something of a red herring. They seem to suggest a final conflict between the worlds (\\"we will be here when you fall\\")--something much more ominous than the story actually gives you.<br />The fact that this short and simple story could have been more doesn't ultimately prevent it from being enjoyable just as it is--at least as a one-time read. My main caveat in recommending it is: know the child! It's not a \\"scary\\" book, exactly, but it is extremely creepy. An imaginative kid is going to find this book getting under his skin in a most unpleasant way. It has scary things hiding behind doors, under beds, and scratching at the window panes at night. The rats' songs made even me want to get up and turn on all the lights. For some kids, that describes their perfect book. Just make sure you have that kind of kid before giving him this!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I knew this movie would be good. I skipped school to go see the first showing. I was that confident! As I left the movie theatre, I knew I had been right. This movie was an absolute thrill. It's been almost 3 months since I saw the movie and I can't hold out much longer. My anticipation is only inceased by knowing that Book 5 comes out 2 days before my birthday. Naturally I haven't seen the DVD yet with its 19 cut/extended scenes, interviews with the actors and (most profoundly)Joanne Kathleen Rowling herself! But I was right about the theatrical release wasn't I?<br />For those of you who refrained from paying [$$$] to see it in the theatre (that's cool, I've done that with other films) I'll give you a brief rundown. Viewers of film 1 may recall how constrained and unreactive the younger actors are. Things happened and they just seemed to take it in stride. This is no longer the case in The Chamber of Secrets. Harry, Ron, and Hermonie show their emotions a lot more making the movie far more believable. The sets also seems much bigger. There are more classrooms and the climax moment when Lockhart, (excellently caste) Harry, and Ron go down to the Chamber just seem to expand the walls of Hogwarts. The Forbidden Forest,too, extends out into a greater and scarier frontier.<BR>The Quidditch field is possibly the most noticable set that seems to have been cursed with an engorgment charm. There are more stands and there is a particularly exciting moment when the Golden Snitch leads Harry and Malfoy into the superstructure of the pitch.<br />Important new members to the cast include, Professor Lockhart, Lucius Malfoy, and Tom Riddle. They all play their parts magnificently and behave as I thought they did in the book.<BR>In short, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets adaptation to the screen was as faithful as the first, but was far more exciting.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This was a truly dazzling film.  It makes you cry with Elsie and Miss. Wilson, makes you laugh with Lady Trentham, and makes you suspicious with the rest of this superior cast. Gosford Park is a film about a shooting party in the countryside of England with dozens of people visiting the mansion. The owner, Sir William McCordle, has been the objection of hatred by many people and that gives a motive for anyone to kill him. Along with the murder, this film is also about the differences in lifestyle of the workers and of the wealthy. The reason I love Gosford Park is that you can see the movie over and over again and see something new. Also, with a cast of 35 people, you can focus yourself on one character and still love the movie. This movie is a soon-to-be classic in my opinion.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|The album is wonderfully put together; the playing is great; the songs are funny-lovely.  All credit to Seor Dylan for his art.

B00007BKVC|5.0|This DVD includes a facinating full length commentary by Ridley Scott which is like a masterclass in film making.  Unlike some directors who aimlessly rambles on Ridley Scott's illustrations and comments are pointed, thoughtful and interesting.<br />This DVD also includes on a separate track a full length commentaries/converstations between Sarandon, Davis and Callie (writer) and is fun, laid back and nostaligic.<br />Also included are deleted scenes and a deleted alternate ending and although interesting illustrates why not including them made for a better edited film.<br />A must for all movie fans of this classic film and a definate must for any aspiring student of film studies.
1570629706|5.0|As a young man, Siddhartha tells his father that he wants to go live among the samanas (wandering ascetics) to learn from them. His father objects, but Siddhartha refuses to move from the spot he is standing on until his father allows him to go or he dies (whichever comes first). With a sad heart, his father, seeing Siddhartha's determination, allows him to go. Siddhartha's friend and \\"disciple\\", Govinda, follows him to live with the samanas in the forest, fasting or begging for alms from the people. From the samanas, Siddhartha learns how to empty himself of worldly desires and to lose himself to become one with the world around him. However, this does not satisfy him.<br />When the Buddha comes to their area, Govinda convinces Siddhartha to go hear what he has to say. Although, the Buddha speaks truth, Siddhartha says, \\"'But one thing this doctrine, so clear, so venerable, does not contain: it does not contain the secret of what the Sublime One himself experienced, he alone among the hundreds of thousands.'\\" Siddhartha says that \\"'This is why I am continuing my wanderings -- not to seek another, better doctrine, because I know there is none, but to leave behind all teachings & all teachers, and either to attain my goal alone or to die.'\\"<br />Govinda stays to become a disciple of the Buddha while Siddhartha sets out to attain enlightenment on his own terms. Finally, he comes to the realization that he has spent his life trying to escape the world and himself. Now, he seeks to find himself. He says, \\"'I shall no longer be instructed by the YOGA VEDA or the ATHARVA VEDA, or the ascetics, or any other doctrine whatsoever. I shall learn from myself, be a pupil of myself, the mystery of Siddhartha.'\\" At this point \\"[h]e look[s] around as if he [is] seeing the world for the first time.\\" And, although, he leaves all formal teachings & teachers behind, the people and experiences he encounters on his journey through life continue to teach him.<br />The story of Siddhartha is the story that many of us live. We follow after various teachings and doctrines. And, eventually, we open our mind to \\"see the world for the first time\\" through our own eyes. I could relate to Siddhartha's spiritual journey up to a certain point; this could be the story of my own spiritual journey. But I'd like to read it again and again as the years progress to see just how much more of it I'm able to relate to as I mature. So much of it seems to be the type of wisdom I'll have to learn for myself and can't quite yet absorb. As the aging Siddhartha says upon becoming reacquainted with Govinda, \\"'Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness.'\\"a is the story that many of us live. We follow after various teachings and doctrines.

B000002KXV|5.0|I had always thought that Steely Dan were the most cynical musical bunch the world had ever known, and had always loved them for it. So who knew that Donald Fagen's first outing after the \\"breakup\\" of Steely Dan would be so warm hearted? Fagen takes a nostalgic look back at his years growing up, listening to jazz, and wishing for the amazing world of science to make the world a better place. All the while, the music maintains the high quality jazz pop hybridizing that Steely Dan fans were expecting from him.<br />There's more affection on \\"The Nightfly's\\" eight songs than Steely Dan put into their entire library. \\"I.G.Y. (What A Beautiful World)\\" has such a bright outlook that you have to remind yourself that this is the man who once sang about the post-nuclear future that followed the \\"assassins, cons and rapers...might as well die.\\" There's longing for the first love in \\"Maxine\\" and a telling remake of Dion and The Belmonts' \\"Ruby Baby\\" to show that, despite the ennui and world-weary tone that Steely Dan often took, Donald Fagen was more of a romantic than we ever suspected.
B000002UAO|5.0|It wasn't too long after the release of RUBBER SOUL that John Lennon made the infamous remark that the band was now &quot;bigger than Jesus.&quot;  While I'll leave it to the philosophers to debate the issue, there's no question as to who sold more records.  Between 1964 and 1965 the Beatles charted ten albums in the Top 10 and placed 25 singles in the Top 40!<br />If they never released another album after RUBBER SOUL, they would still be regarded as one of the most influential artists in pop music history.  The album kicks off with what could have been a huge single, the rollicking &quot;Drive My Car&quot; (which wouldn't be available in the U.S. for another six months when it appeared on YESTERDAY AND TODAY).  Lennon's &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; introduced American ears to the Indian sitar played by George Harrison.  Harrison also got an uprecedented two songs on this album:  The fuzz bass-driven Think For Yourself&quot; and the lovely &quot;If I Needed Someone.&quot;  Even Ringo gets a songwriting credit along with Lennon-McCartney on the very country-sounding &quot;What Goes On.&quot; [Although it should be noted that the original U.S. pressings credited the song only to Lennon-McCartney.]<br />McCartney's standout track is the ballad &quot;Michelle,&quot; but this album is clearly dominated by Lennon with highlights like &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; &quot;The Word,&quot; &quot;In My Life&quot; and &quot;Run for Your Life.&quot;  This is clearly the Beatles best album up to this point and would not be topped until they released REVOLVER the following summer.

0385503954|3.0|The brilliance of this novel eludes me. Although it is very good--well worth reading--it is not the exploration of its theme that I was expecting, that it should be to draw these reviews. They say it is well-crafted, and it is that; they say it is suspenseful, and it is that, as well; but, they also say it is comparable to his Booker Prize-winning book _Amsterdam_, and it isn't even close. It's a notch below it. Everything should come together in the end to reveal its message, theme, and ideas. It doesn't. In the end, it's a good book--well-crafted, well-written, thoroughly engaging, almost perfect. I recommend it, but I don't celebrate it.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones has all the elements to make a sappy made-for-tv movie on CBS. However what astonished me was that despite opportunities to do so on every page, the book doesn't fall into the same traps or take the same shortcuts by way of clich, that network executives and Hallmark writers use to manipulate us. This book manages to deal with subjects that have been subjected for so long to trite, \\"cheese-flavored chemical\\" treatment, but Sebold makes it all real and truthful, and that alone makes this book rare and wonderful.<BR>What really captured me about the book though was the way that it reads much like a mystery or suspense novel. The same feelings keep you up into the night reading this book as if you were reading a thriller. The important difference that makes this work so unique, is that it's not a whodunit. We know that in the first chapter. The mystery is one that is much more real: how do the ordinary people, the loved ones and family, continue on after something so terrible has occurred. In a regular mystery, the great detective would spend a page or two worrying after the poor grieving family before going on miraculously find clues that no one else could find, to ultimately discover the who, how and why. And for the most part we follow these sleuths through every twist and turn, and suspend or disbelief, because the mystery of recovery is something much more implausible. It is not only a frightening possibility to think about what one would do if a loved one died from violence, but many of us see it as an unsolvable mystery: \\"What would you do? I don't know. There's no way to know. I wouldn't be able to deal with it. I better not even think about it because it's information I hope I never need.\\"<BR>But Sebold tackles this more difficult mystery as she follows the family and friends that the murder victim leaves behind. And like any good mystery, there are suspenseful events and unexpected twists. Magic and tragedy are dolled out by fate like traceevidence accidentally dropped at a crime scene.<BR>And though perhaps the story of people dealing with tragedy is not really unique as an idea, the way in which it is laid out, like a mystery writing itself, is much more real and honest, because no written rules on the stages of grief can predict the behavior of such a large group of individuals in pain. And the fact that Sebold tells the story in such an earnest manner, avoiding clich by making it seem that even she doesn't know what will come next, because how can anyone predict how they will survive something so horrible. This book succeeds at a challenge that many serious writers would be afraid to undertake, and one that many lesser writers undertake often not realizing the responsibility they're mistreating. This book can't answer how you or I personally would navigate the murky waters of tragedy, but it shows us honestly and sometimes painfully how some very real characters manage it.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Let me get this out of the way now; I am a huge comic book fan.  So in that context, my view maybe somewhat biased.  From talking to other people who saw the late Thursday showing, I was expecting the second coming of Spawn (a very murky, dreadful movie).  I'm glad that my feelings didn't stop me from seeing this very dark but wonderful movie.<br />Without giving away the basic plot, here's what I thought was the good and the bad about the movie:<br />The Good<br />* Affleck held his own as Matt Murdock/Daredevil<br />* Great shots of Hell's Kitchen gave off a great mood of murkiness<br />* Jon Favreau was hilarious and ate up whatever little screen time he had as Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson<br />* Colin Farrell was great as the zany Bullseye<br />* None of the major characters dies (unlike the Batman series or the more recent Spider-Man movie)<br />* Tons of inside comic book references for geeks like me to appreciate<br />The Bad<br />* Daredevil actually allowed a criminal die when he could've done something to save him - Way out of character and took me out of the movie for a couple of minutes<br />* Not a fan of the sensory-deprivation chamber<br />* No Stick (character introduced by Frank Miller in the comics and helped Murdock adapt to his new powers)<br />* Although necessary, Electra's sais training seemed somewhat forced and disjointed<br />Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie and will go to see the sequel, if there is one.
B000088E6M|5.0|Unlike other people who were anticipating 'Get Rich Or Die Trying', I didn't make any assumptions about this album.  I waited until I actually heard it.  Well let me tell you, this album was worth the wait.  50 Cent always proves that this rap game is for him, especially on mixtapes along with his main G-Unit soldiers Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo.  I am glad that the mainstream audience now knows who he is. I can listen to this album all the way through.  As a matter of fact I love the entire album. <br />These are the songs that I listen to more:<br />What Up Gansta<BR>Patiently Waiting<BR>Many Men<BR>In Da Club<BR>If I Can't<BR>P.I.M.P<BR>Like My Style<BR>Poor Lil Rich<BR>21 Questions<br />*One of the bonus songs 'Life's On The Line' has actually been one of my favorite 50 Cent songs for awhile now. Before he was shot :(<br />I also loved the bonus dvd.  It gave me more of an insight of 50's personlity and lifestyle. :)

B00006L83N|5.0|This is a perfect piece of work! All the musicians sound better and more determined than on their previous record. But I have to admit that I like &quot;V: The new mythology suite&quot; better because of the epic quality of the songwriting. But at the same time, &quot;Odyssey&quot; offers what &quot;V&quot; lacks, just as the two discs of &quot;Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulance&quot; are kind of complementary in style. Another often used phrase that fits for &quot;Odyssey&quot; might be &quot;riff - oriented&quot;. In fact, the title track is an overture, followed by the different stages of the journey, which each are in essence some exellent guitar riffs. <br />One word about the bonus track: GREAT songwriting! It's a good example of how Symphony X sounded before &quot;V&quot;. If you like it, you might love &quot;Pharao&quot; of their astonishing &quot;The Divine Wings Of Tragedy&quot;.<br />By the way: While writing this review, I find that there are three stages of Symphony X: pre &quot;V&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, and post &quot;V&quot;.

(Revised 4/4/05)  ------------------------------------------------------------   (Original comments:)  Wow! As most people know, Jeff Beck took over for Eric Clapton in the old Yardbirds group. His legend preceeds him. I saw him with Rod Stewart in 1968 captivate a sold out crowd with his guitar wizardry and interplay with Stewart's vocals. After Rod went on to greater things with the bass player (Ron Wood, now with the Rolling Stones) Jeff still held his own with his jazz-rock fusion thing, a la Jan Hammer. I think that Stewart left because of Jeff's ego problems, or something. Anyway, back then Jeff based his guitar intonations on something solid -- an excellent copy of Afro-American Blues and Jazz! Nobody will deny that those English cats had the sound down cold -- they were excellent students.     After the Yardbirds and Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart, Jeff continued to get more into the Jazz scene with his trademark special effects guitar work. His most impressive work, magnum opus, if you will, was produced in cooperation with the Fifth Beatle, George Martin, and was titled \\"Wired.\\" Oh, yeah, he got back together with Rod and came out with \\"Flash\\" in the mid '80s, but it was a half-hearted effort.  ------------------------------------------------------------   Jeff came out with \\"Jeff\\" and he's back in the game! On this  CD he was just getting his hands cleaned up. Forget this one  and get his latest.

0316096199|5.0|Alice Sebold's ironically titled memoir, \\"Lucky,\\" is one of those rare and persuasive works of self-examination which plumbs a terrain few wish to explore:  rape.  Violently assaulted, sodomized and raped as a first-year student at Syracuse University, Sebold emerges as a woman able to summon extraordinary couage in the face of catastrophic violation and loss.  \\"Lucky\\" is powerful and precise, evocative and searing, instructive and redemptive.  Ultimately, it is a work which validates the author's immense struggle against victimhood and extols the need for voice and memory in the face of personal degradation.<br />Several recurrent themes appear, transform and reappear in \\"Lucky.\\"  Of primary importance is Sebold's insistence that despite the intervention (often bungled or unsuccessful) of police, family and friends, a rape victim essentially shoulders the responsibility for her own redemption.  \\"You save yourself or remain unsaved.\\"  A corollary emerges to complement this isolative requirement.  Rape victims inhabit a different physical and moral universe.<br />Rape is a watershed event, \\"a planet\\" in which an act of premeditated malice and violence places the victim on the other side of the chasm.  To those who are uninitiated, the pain is unfathomable and unknowable.  When Sebold's erudite, affect-limited father expresses an ignorant incredulity as to what he imagines to be his daughter's supposed non-resistance, she laments that if her own father doesn't understand, what hope is there that any man can.  Hers is an abyss created from fear, confusion, ignorance and denial.<br />A third theme vividly presents itself through the image of ruin.  When Sebold bitterly concedes, \\"No nice boy will ever want me,\\" she internalizes all the \\"horrible words used for rape; I was changed, bloodied, damaged goods, ruined.\\"  One of the quiet but profound virtues of this memoir is how the author slowly wrests dignity and strength from abject degradation and despair.<br />The finalthemes will resonate within any person who has been victimized.  They are the need to fight back, the thirst to gain control and autonomy of one's body and soul, and the want to ally oneself with loving, gentle, strong, understanding compatriots who will nurture a growing quest for justice and redress.  Sebold's ringing, eloquent insistence on breaking silence energizes her post-rape experience.  She learns that there is \\"power to be had in sharing my story.\\"  Bearing witness, pointing her finger at the perpetrator, giving voice to pure, seething rage permit Sebold to shed her weakness, isolation and self-blame.  Sepaking out and choosing to prosectute the rapist are acts of defiance, ownership and reclamation of sovereignty over her body, and, consequently, her spirit.<br />Aligned with voice are her radiant and inspirational professors who augment her sense of possibility and offer the solace and solidarity only a teacher can offer his/her students.  The poet Tess Gallagher is a true heroine, a genuine teacher, artist and friend.  Tobias Wolfe's gentle but firm invocation to \\"remember everything\\" affirms Sebold's assertion that \\"memory could save, that it has power, that often it is the only recourse of the powerless, the oppressed or the brutalized.\\"<br />This necessary and quintessentially inspirational memoir is suffused with pain, false dawns and recurrent tragedy.  Written in part with the detached precision of a journalist and the informed heart of a poet, \\"Lucky\\" compels our identification and respect.
B0000028RR|2.0|After listening to this album several times I have concluded that it is way overrated and doesn't deliver the goods despite of all the 5 star reviews here. Sure its better than linkin park and the lot but that doesn't say much at all. Musically this album cannot compete with with other far more interesting acts of that era such as soundgarden and RHCP whom displayed far more class and intelligence in their sound.<br />The lyrics and vocals sink things much further as they come across as very pretentious and quite obnoxious, with little variation. <br />Halfway through the album I get really tired of it all. Certainly impressionable and anti-everything types will love this but to me what could have been more becomes rather annoying.
B000002H97|3.0|I really can't blame musicians for wanting to change.  Another \\"...And Justice For All\\" would have sounded tired in 1990.  And hey, they even plugged in Jason Newstead's bass here.<br />But there is no question they were looking for gold here.  The songs are very unoriginal, and in many cases uninteresting.  There are more anthems here than on an AC/DC album, and the production of Bob Rock is radio-friendly.  Lars Ulrich continued to get his wish that the drum is the loudest instrument in the mix, and perhaps an unintnentional effect of his ego was how well some of these songs played in bars and clubs.<br />There was no question that Metallica fans were dissapointed, but their target audience was not their fans, and arguably not even themselves. \\"Don't Tread On Me\\", \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Enter Sandman\\" were written for fans they hadn't even acquired yet.  These were fans that had far more purchasing power than their current set, and this albumm propelled them into superstardom while alienting most of their diehard fans.  Thrash metal and power metal has a much smaller base than pop-rock, and for the most part, limited spending money circa 1990.<br />If this album was forgiven for being a sharp left turn, the tour was not.  After enduring yet another showing of the MTV Rockumentary, we couldn't have been less interested in hearing \\"Enter Sandman\\" open the show, a full 45 minutes of noodling that culminated in \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", or even James Hetfield's drumming contest with Lars Ulrich )...  It's loaded with sing-along choruses, slickly produced, and radio-ready.  Is it a good Metallica album? Compared with what was to follow, in retrospect, I would have to answer with a reluctant \\"yes\\".
B000002J0B|4.0|Houses of the Holy is an allright album.  The Song Remains the Same is a great opener, but it is unfortunately somehwhat marred by Plant's singing.  Personally, I think it would've been better in it's original state (an instrumental called \\"The Campaign\\").  The Rain Song is one of those songs that I have to be in the right mood to listen to.  Still good to mellow out to though. Compliments the opener nicely.  Over the Hills and Far Away, though overplayed by many radio stations, is still good.  I think they should've left The Crunge as a B-side and included it only on a rarities album.  Too damn weird.  Dancing Days is a killer song, and I heard the most god-awful cover of it the other day by some crappy artist (not the one on Econmium).  Blasphemy.  D'Yer Mak'Er is another weird song, but this one I can actually stand. Just for the record, it's pronounced Jer-Maker. John Paul Jones sez so.  No Quarter is easily the best song on the album.  Great guitar work, awesome keyboards, nicely done drums, and Plant isn't goosing himself.  Also, at 7 minutes, great potential for long live jams (as seen on the movie \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and on the 1977 bootleg \\"Destroyer\\").  The Ocean is somewhat of a mystery to me.  It's still a good song, but it feels like they tried to write 3 songs at the same time, couldnt decide which direction to go, and just ended up splicing them together.  Still works (kinda).  All in all, not a bad album... just one that takes a bit to get used to.
B000002L9M|5.0|This is the pinnacle of Depeche Mode's career ( well before Violator ) and is their darkest album ( arguably ). From Black Celebration to Question Of Time to the Stripped remix ( Breathing in Fumes ) this album is for anyone who likes DM at their moodiest
B000066NW0|5.0|When I heard her first single &quot;Complicated&quot; I was pretty impressed. So I reluctently bought her CD because I hadn't heard any of her other songs. But when I popped it in my CD player I listened to a few of her other songs and was just...awed. Her voice isn't like any of all the other girls. It has a tomboyish accent which was refreshing believe me. I was really sick of hearing Britney and Spice Girls like voices. But beware, this isn't a punk album. It has it's more of a pop/rock type. Though, unlike many people, think she's a punk-poser. She isn't mimicing anybody and not a punk even though all the magazines say &quot;She's a Hardcore Punk!&quot; She's not. I think she's only trying to express herself in her own way. It's kind of being like your own kind of punk. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who likes pop/rock. So don't let people tell you this isn't a good CD till you try it for yourself. You may like it. If I didn't like her music, I wouldn't be going to her concert in April. <br />Hope this helped out!
B000002OX5|4.0|Hojala las radios fueran asi, seria espectacular, pero lamentablemente no las hay. Esto lo digo ya que el disco esta ambientado como si fuera una radio londinense, con comerciales entre tema y tema (hechos por los mismos who) y todo lo que una radio tiene. En general es un disco muy variado, con exelentes arreglos de voces, al igual que los instrumentales. <BR> Lo que tiene esta version con extra tracks es que hay canciones que no fueron editadas en el sell out original, y que en esta edicion sale todos los temas que grabaron para esas sesiones, y lo entretenido es que en ciertas partes de estos temas &quot;no editados anteriormente&quot; se escuchan partes de lo que seria despues su obra maestra Tommy. <BR>  Este disco es de los fundamentales de The Who en esta edicion especialmente, principalmente por la gran variedad de musica que concentraban sus 4 integrantes.
0151008116|5.0|I read other reader reviews in disbelief! This replaced my previous favorite novel of 20 years--&quot; Slaughterhouse Five&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Another reviewer mentioned Kurt, so I saw the connection. Their is such wisdom mixed with humor in Pi, not to mention generous doses of adventure. And so many passages of sheer beauty. I've highly recommended this to all I know. Do not believe the scathing reviews of pseudo-intellectuals; read this life affirming brilliant novel.
B000055X3U|5.0|Como un disco puede llegar a ser tan, pero tan triste?. Es increible pero esta misma tristeza es la que te llama a escucharlo una y otra vez sin cansarte. Para la gente que escucha musica melancolica onda Coldplay, Radiohead del o.k. computer o the gathering hay que decirle que esto es lo extremo de la melancolia, osea es increible. <BR> Anathema no deja sus raices metal en este disco, no mucho en cuanto a la musica sino mas bien en el sonido, experimentan mas con guitarras acusticas, es una mezcla entre pink floyd, black sabbath y radiohead. Son 13 canciones, todas buenas por su eclectisismo y composicion, lo cual deja a Judgement a mi parecer como la obra maestra de Anathema.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Yes, he is another dude in red tights. And that is a shame. This movie will be endlessly compared to spider-man just because it features a man in tight spandex. ... Daredevil is at least five times better than Spider-man, and there are very few similarities between the two other than the color of their costume. ... Forget about spider-man, block out thoughts of every other superhero movie and watch this film, a very close adaptation of the comic books, with good acting, a good storyline, well choreographed and interesting action scenes (unlike the other red wonder's little diddy) and an enjoyable, satisfying finale. If you look at it that way, it won't disappoint.
B00005614M|5.0|Perhaps I am impartial because I really don't think anything Miles Davis has done has not been without obvious genius and hasn't sounded good.

B000077VR3|5.0|Baz Luhrman is an exceptional avant-garde director and artist. His \\"Red Curtain Trilogy\\" is composesd of Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet and concludes with Moulin Rouge. The \\"Red Curtain\\" refers to the opening curtain rise at the opening of the films. Moulin Rouge is a beautiful film, cinematically lush and romantic to watch. The songs and dancing, the meat of the musical genre, are connected in a sublime fashion, accessible to audiences of all ages, but almost specifically, the MTV and pop generation. Baz Luhrman attempted to revive the musical format on film again, a lost art in Hollywood since the 30's, 40's 50's and 60's. Although a non-musical film in the 60's has been made about the decadent nightclub of 19th century Paris (starring Zsa Zsa Gabor), Luhrman assembled fine actors and singers to tell a tragic story tinged with human emotion, from comedy to heartaching tragedy. <br />Nicole Kidman sizzles as the vibrant, elegant, sexy courtesan Satine, who stirs inspiration and love in the heart of the young writer, Christian (played by Ewan Mcgregor). But there is rivalry for the fair lady's hand. A villainous, pompous and wealthy Duke  also falls for Satine and will stop at nothing to have her. The love triangle becomes complicated when Satine must make love with the Duke in order to save the popular nightclub. But when her love for Christian proves stronger than the domineering Duke's powers, the real tragedy unfolds. Art begins to imitate life as the musical the bohemian actors in Paris put on is a mirror projection of Christian and Satine's love, nearly foiled by a jealous and dark Duke. The songs come from the 80's (Madonna's aterial Girl, Like A Virgin, We Can Be Heroes, Nature Boy, Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong), with the exception of a few selections from the Sound of Music (The Hills Are Alive) and the song popularized by Marilyn Munroe in the late 50's, \\"Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend\\". Added songs for the musical itself are key moments, such asSatine singing about her hope to rise to stardom and to escape from the dissolute life of a courtesan (One Day I'll Fly Away) and the love duet with Ewan Mcgregor (Come What May) which becomes their signature love theme. Another fine moment is when Satine must convince in false act that she no longer loves Christian and will remain in the Moulin Rouge while the cast prepares for the musical that night (The Show Must Go On). Superb performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor as the star-crossed lovers. The costumes and scenery are highly provocative and true to late 19th century Paris. Shots of Montmatre and the Eiffel Tower, touched by fantasy (such as an opera-singing tenor moon sung by Placido Domingo and a Gothic castle for the Duke). Providing the most comic relief is John Leguizamo's performance as the drunk bohemian artist Toulouse Lautrec. This film on DVD is a fine gift for romantics, a great collection on the shelf not only as a musical, but a great romantic story that has not come in a long while.
B00005JLXC|1.0|Before seeing the movie on opening night, I read all of the preceding reviews and came to the conclusion that people all have differing values for any number of different reasons.  Thus,  my review cannot be, should not be, won't be, the final word.  I'm 53, grew up reading Daredevil comics, another person half my age who read the comics, or didn't, will have a different take on it.<br />Regardless of being a fan way back then, the movie should stand on its own, whether you know who Daredevil is or not.  Thus, his origin is given near the beginning in an extended flashback.<br />By the time that is finished there is only about an hour left to the movie and really not enough time to get into anything in depth, and yet the director let some scenes just drag on.<br />Matt Murdock, the blind attorney, seems to have no problem showing off his extraordinary skills to just about anyone whom he wants to impress, and nobody seems to give it more than a momentary surpise.  Well, this is a fantasy, I suppose.  Yeah,  I can buy into Spiderman; but I'm having trouble buying into Daredevil.  Btw, Matt can do all these fantastic things, but can't seem to ever get his hair brushed neatly, go figure.<br />Alright, the movie.   Great acting comes thru.  Colin Farrell: despite having a weird talent, performs magnificently!  He is truly going to have a great future.  Jennifer Garner: great to look at, but for the same reason I stopped watching \\"Alias,\\" I was not happy with her here. Not much of an actress, and the fight scenes with her appear as phony as they do on \\"Alias.\\" Sorry, I was hoping for better on the big screen. The Kingpin: I don't really care if he is white or black, red or yellow.  The man can act, but can the director direct?  Take that as a negative.<br />   I agree with an earlier reviewer that an early fight scene takes place in such a dark room you can't see a thing.  Of course a sensitive blind man has an advantage in the dark, but why waste our time viewing if we can't see a thing happening. An overextended scene at that.<br />    Also, while I'm willing to suspend reality a bit, if a certain person appears near death with a lot of blood loss, how is he all of a sudden able to put it all back together again and fight like nothing has happened to him?  Come on!  Adrenaline, I don't think so.  Just a poor story line, along with a poorly directed film.  <br />   My advice.  If you have to see it, do so before 6PM, or wait for video/cable.  This movie is really an insult to the movie going public.  If the producer thought this movie was going to be a \\"Summer Blockbuster\\" he would have released it then. By releasing it now, without any competition in the same genre, he has a better chance of succeeding.  Daredevil would have been washed away in a summer release, and for good reason.
0316666343|4.0|Not exactly a tear jerker, but more of a endearing perspective on sensitive issues.  the victim of this novel, and also a convincing voice, tells her story in a touching but not excruciatingly painful way.<br />there is not a clear pinnacle in the plot, but in the conclusion it leaves the reader feeling at ease and happy that the novel concluded in a non-dramatic way.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente, a beautiful German actress, The Bourne Identity is a huge success.  Fraught with intense action scenes and rich character development, this movie resounds with the passion of a high speed thriller that will bear many viewings.  I must admit to some trepidation about Matt Damon in an action role given his past roles, this trepidation doesn't bear out though, as he performs admirably in the role of a CIA assassin who has lost his memory.<br />The premise:<br />Jason Bourne is a CIA assassin who is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat.  He has two bullets in his back, an odd little laser device with a Zurich address and no memory as to who he is.  After two weeks on the fishing boat, he heads for Zurich and the search to who he really is.  Once he starts on this quest, he finds that he has some absolutely amazing skills and is almost immediately defending himself from being killed in several different ways.  He is then fortunate enough to find Marie, who he pays to drive him to Paris.  The quickly developed relationship between these two characters is quite beautifully filmed.<br />What ensues is clearly one of the best spy/action thrillers to come out in some time.  This films action sequences will leave you exhausted and the plot line will enthrall you completely.  If this is your type of genre, I highly recommend this film.<br />The Special features are also quite interesting; of note are the alternate ending and the \\"Making of\\" clips.  {ssintrepid}
B00005JLXC|2.0|You'd think that with such an all-star lineup (Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell) they couldn't go wrong.  You'd also think after the huge success of Spiderman that this movie would only end up in dead competition with it.  Also, judging from the previews, the movie looks great.  SO WRONG!  I was laughing the entire time; the corniness was unbelieveable, the ending completely sucked.
B000089A07|3.0|Don't ever try to compare \\"Red Dragon\\" with \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\"  The \\"prequel\\" of the story of Hannibal Lector, which is once made by director Michael \\"Heat\\" Mann as \\"Manhunter\\" before, is just an OK thriller.  You get scared, certainly, but not by the undercurrent phychological power of \\"Lambs,\\" but by sudden big noise and loud, pounding music by Danny Elfman.<br />The story is virtually same as that of \\"Manhunter\\" except that you see Dr. Lector as a civilian in Boltimore, listening to classic music among other law-abiding people (a rare scene, indeed), and that the relation between Dolarhyde and Reba has been explored more.  A retired FBI agent Will Graham agrees to go back in work to investigate the two related bloody murders of families, and to have an aid he meets again Master of Evil, Hannibal Lector, now in maximum-security custody in institution, as you saw in \\"Lams.\\"  But with Lector's cunning trick Graham and his family are exposed to the danger of the still unknown serial killer, who is sure to commit another murder within days.<br />The speed is fast enough to forget the plot holes, and the thrills are provided a lot, thanks to Ted Tally's good script.  The new cast is also effective with Edward Norton as Graham and of course Anthony Hopkins as Lector.  Norton, unlike his predecessor William Pertersen in \\"Manhunter\\", doesn't yell at TV set to \\"think like the killer,\\" which is a good thing.  Philip Seymore Hoffman is also good as a gossip-hungry journalist while my favorite, impressive Harvey Keitel replaces Dennis Farrina role as an FBI partner.<br />But I found two defects in \\"Red Dragon\\"; one of them is that there is no sizzling interaction between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins across the cell wall.  The same set was recreated for this film, I heard, but there is no tension during their dialogues (which I found almost the same as those in \\"Manhunter.\\")  It is curious because they must have decided to remake this one to capitalize on the popularity of Hopkins' Lector, and as if to show that to us, they give more chances for Graham to meet Lector (in \\"Manhunter\\" they meet only once face to face).  The reason for the lower tension might be attributed to Hopkins's less interest, but my feeling is that it should be owing to director's skill.<br />The other flaw is less convincing relation between the characters by Emily Watson and Ralph Fiennes.  It is certain that their roles are given more time, but I frankly say that I find that part boring.  I simply couldn't help thinking that they overact a bit, especially Fiennes with body tattoos and exaggerated gestures, which are bordering on caricature.  As for this sub-plot, Tom Noonan and Joan Allen did a better job.<br />\\"Red Dragon\\" succeeds as fast-paced thriller, but without depth.  Brett Ratner is famous for two \\"Rush Hour\\" films, which are certainly hits, but no definite Jackie Chan film.  If you need a definite Lector, you must watch \\"Lambs\\" again.

Hans Blix looks funny and sounds funny, but the same cannot be said for the Hives. Majorly cool, their enigmatic songs betray description. They are simply fun to listen to. A good place to start your personal tour of the Hives is in fact on this recording (Veni, Vedi, Viscious), is a tune called &quot;Find Another Girl&quot;. Think Beatles + the B52s.

B00001OH7Y|4.0|Scary Monsters saw Bowie's return to a full-bodied rock sound, heavy with guitar and feedback. The catchy Ashes To Ashes revisits Major Tom of Space Oddity while the funky Fashion with its gripping vocals is in a way a rock treatment of a theme from Young Americans - it has become a club classic. Other great tracks include Up The Hill Backwards, Scream Like A Baby and the cover of Tom Verlaine's Kingdom Come. The sound is as heavy as on The Man Who Sold The World but with all the added experiments of the 1970's to create a very 80's hard rock effect. It is definitely more accessible to the rock fan than any of his Eno albums that went before, and better than most of what followed.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I heard and saw T.A.T.U's music vedio on TV,my heart was totally touched by their song. It's just so so so sad I could say.No matter the beats of &quot;All the things she said&quot; or the lyrics in this song, they definitely represent many many things in this world I think.I LOVE T.A.T.U.
B00001OH7X|3.0|This is my least favorite of Bowie's trilogy of albums produced by Brian Eno. It lacks the innovation and freshness of Low, and there are no truly spectacular songs like the title track from Heroes. Perhaps it is that I find the music somewhat clinical and devoid of emotion, but I experience this album as very fragmentary. While not bland, the musical textures and moods are aloof and have an unfinished feel about them. To me, Boys Keep Swinging and Fantastic Voyage are the only memorable songs and `Boys' had a fantastic video clip. The song DJ comments on the disco era in a set of vivid images and the various experiments in rhythm are noteworthy. I'm awarding it 3 stars for its obvious intelligence, but my personal enjoyment of it is limited.
B00005YU1O|1.0|I just finished watching this, thank goodness I rented it and didn't buy it.  This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<BR>I had heard good things about this movie. However, not only does it fail to live up to the hype, the film [stinks]. Instead of having a story, the film follows a character that walks around listening to different people spout various philosophical views on the nature of existence.  These monologues are (I guess) supposed to inspire us to think about life.  The problem is these monologues are grammar-school level simpleton conversations.  It doesn't discuss anything beyond common sense.  Unless you've lived in a cave and never thought about questioning God or why you exist, this movie doesn't give you anything the least bit interesting to digest.  I'm sure the people who worked on this movie must have thought they were really intelligent and deep thinking by talking about these simple concepts.  The reality of it is that this movie is a stupid, complete waste of time.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Hunky Dory was Bowie's last album as a wannabe, just before he found fame with Ziggy Stardust. It's a fascinating work on many levels, displaying lyrical depth, wit and great musical variety, from the music hall pop of Changes, through the sixties pop of Oh You Pretty Things to the cinematic lyricism of Life On Mars, a soaring masterpiece. Another of my favorites is Fill Your Heart, a quirky number with his somersaulting voice over lively piano and cheeky sax. Elements of the folk singer/songwriter are evident on numbers like Song For Bob Dylan while The Supermen reminds me of his later science fiction work. Bowie also salutes Lou Reed and Andy Warhol here, in fact the whole album makes references to his musical influences. It is a bridge between his earlier music hall style and the glamrock that was to follow, and this was just the right mixture to ensure a timeless classic.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|With techno-styled music and lyrics considered taboo in the U.S, t.A.T.u. springs out of Russia with a sound that's gonna take over the music world.  It doesn't matter if they're lesbian, bi or what-have-you, but these girl's are giving it their all.  Lena Katina and Yulia Volkova have arrived to let the world know that love comes in all forms.  Their beautiful accents swirled together with English lyrics give a unique feel to their cover of the Smiths' &quot;How Soon is Now?&quot;  All and all, these girls sound promising.  I hope to hear more of them in the future.
B00001OH7V|4.0|This album follows the pattern of Low, the first one in the Eno trilogy, in its mix of short pop/rock songs and moody instrumentals and semi-instrumentals. Somehow it lacks the trenchant edge of Low, although the title track is truly magnificent in its irony and great emotional impact - his voice sounds as human as on Word On A Wing (from Station To Station) over the wailing drone of the synths as it paints a scenario of lovers meeting beneath the Berlin wall. Truly breathtaking, this song was also released as a single in German and French versions in the seventies. The melancholy Sons Of The Silent Age has a spacey feel, beautiful lyrics and a ghostly chorus, while Blackout is harsh and discordant. I love the sax and the driving beat of V2 Schneider and Bowie's voice intoning the title. Moss Garden is a delicate instrumental, a sound I recognized later in some pieces by e.g. Autechre and Cabaret Voltaire, but the sung Secret Life Of Arabia drags a bit. Heroes remains my favorite of Bowie's trilogy of Eno-produced albums.

I remember when I was younger that cartoon had fascinated me!  This movie is so well done and Beautiful, it's very magical.  Show this movie to your kids and they will love it and even when they be older they still going to love it, just like me!:)
B0000541AM|1.0|The Warriors is one of my favorite films of all time..it is one of the ultimate cult films ever made.  How can they release this DVD with nothing more than a lousy trailer?  Where is the deleted scene that was only seen on ABC TV in NY on the old Friday Night Movie (at the beggining they showed the Warriors, in daylight, hanging out on the boardwalk talking about the trip to the Bronx before the classic \\"wonder Wheel\\" night-train scene)?  How could they have left all this out?  Where is Walter Hill's commentary?????  Where are the interviews with the actors?  The photo galleries? The contest to get an official WARRIORS vest? (OK--maybe I'm pushing it a little bit here). PLEASE Paramount--re-release this.  How can you have released such a lame DVD to a film with such a HUGE and LOYAL following?...
B000006TRV|5.0|A masterpiece in every sense of the word.  Pink Floyd's epic, sprawling tome on loneliness and isolation should be in every serious rock collectors shelf.  There isn't any album out there that sounds anything like this, and probably never will.  It also contains the greatest Pink Floyd song of all time, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;.  Forget Eminem, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, or whoever the flavor of the month is, this IS Rock and Roll.
0316666343|2.0|There is no denying that Sebold is a terrific writer with great prose, but THE LOVELY BONES moves way too slow.  The idea is interesting, and the way our villian is killed is fantastic.  But for such a slow moving book to be such an amazing seller amazes me!  Go figure.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Former Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden mixed toghether, Audioslave has become one of my favorite bands. Guitarist Tom Morello, Drummer Brad Wilk, Bassist Tim Commerford and Vocalist Chris Cornell join up-and let me tell you they make a great band. At first, I doubted Audioslave's potential. I thought, &quot;Ex Grunge vocalist and aggro-punk ex-Rage Against the Machine joining up? Nonsense...&quot;<BR>However, I listened to a few of their songs, and soon I found myself enjoying the few songs I had, and then I couldn't wait for my copy of the album to come! I mainly listen to Nmetal, Heavy metal and such, howevere there are a few exceptions. Audioslave's mix of smooth and melodic-to-potent hard rock vocals and heavy-to-light mix of guitar is just enthralling, and I find myself yearning for a nice mix of light-heavy music, just like Audioslave, while listening to stronger stuff.<BR>Bottomline- If you're a hardcore heavy metal fan, move along.<BR>(N)Metal fan? I trust you'll like Audioslave.<BR>Rap-Rock? You might like them-though be wary, no rap here.<BR>Pop-rock? I'm pretty sure you'll like them.<BR>If you fall in any other category, I'm not sure, but give it a try anyway! I loved it.<BR>However, you might ask why I gave it 4(.5 really) stars, instead of five. It's mainly a personal thing, I find the last few songs to go a bit too slowly for my tastes, and there just isn't a good mix.<BR>A little side note I'd like to make, the begining of the album is the closest to heavy rock, however as the tracks develop, the songs reach a lighter level of rock, until &quot;The Last Remaining Light&quot;.<BR>Try it out.
0792838068|5.0|I'm writing this in 2003 only because a recent conversation I had reminded me of the fact that I could have writen the exact same thing in 1995.  The story is great but the acting is better than anything I've seen in years.  I think that the overall critique of this film was disheartening because people viewed it ,as a depressing movie that brings you down and I could see how.  I would'nt be crazy to say that Cage's performance could be up there with the best of all time. Mind blowing to me
B00006CXSS|5.0|I did not end up seeing this \\"mini series\\" until a week ago after buying it since I heard such amazing reviews about it.  It is more than a \\"mini series\\" it is a full blown out movie.....and it is 10 hours long of continous better than Saving Private Ryan movie!  Ever since I saw it, it rose to the top of my favorite movie list above LOTR, Black Hawk Down, and Saving Private Ryan.  It was just that great!  Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg really know how to put a great film together.  As you have heard a million times, BoB follows the 101st Airborne Easy Company from training to the very end of the war.  Here is a cool fact:  BoB used more pyrotechnics than Saving Private Ryan after making the 2nd episode....and ten were made in total!  You can easily get hooked on all of the characters who could not have been played better by any other actor and the movie is just eye-popping greatness.  It is in general the same type of movie as Saving Private Ryan in where pretty much all of the movie is in the action of war, but BoB just is better.  You will not be displeased by the episode where they jump into the enemy territory from the plane on their first real mission.  One of the great things about this DVD is the \\"external set-up.\\"  The six discs are in a cool zig-zag fold out thing that is totally covered in full color photos.  The tin that it is in is even greater.  Although, I have not yet seen the 80 min. main documentary where the veterans of Easy Company tell the entire story through their own words, the other special features are great.  The best special feature is the video diary made by one of the actors and it shows mostly their time in military boot camp that they had to suffer through before shooting this great movie.  Emotions that this movie can give people are: amazement, sadness, joy, drama, suspense, and a total feeling that you are with Easy Company in all of their missions and objectives.  I would give this DVD/movie 10/5 stars if I could.  My opinion is that you order it right now or sometime very soon.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I just want to say that this cd has brought a remarkable insiration in my life.  There are so many words to explain it that i cant possibly think of.  They shed light on girls around the world who are scared to let out who they are and what they beleive in.  Anyone who is everyone should buy this cd just to experience a little on the wild side.  And if your Russian I'm sure you know what I mean.  Please go buy this cd and make T.A.T.U a worldwide favorite.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|A friend of mine told me about the group and I was schocked.I got  hooked becaouse of the local lyrics.When I first herd the two wemon singing I thought it was a much bigger group like four or six girlls.Amazingly it was only two and it takes a lot of talent and hard work to produce something like this.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Hi, I just want to say that tatu is the best band in all around the world. I love them!!!<BR>The cd is fresh, young and original, buy it, buy it, buy it!!!
B000088E6D|5.0|A Valentines Day gift, this CD is outstanding!!!  Boy can this guy sing!!  Amazing style and confidence in his voice, fantastic arrangements and orchestration.  Michael Buble has a major career ahead of him.  Let's hope he continues with this genre for his follow-up album and doesn't sell out to his age group!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|A few days ago, a thought crossed my mind, a funny thing about this album--I'd had it for less than a week at that point and had never listened to radiohead at all before, but I was listening through OK Computer and had the thought, &quot;I've known this music all my life.&quot;  Which is certainly crazy, but the more I listen to the album, a masterpiece, the more I think it true.  Incredible music, right-on lyrics, and exactly what I would have done had I the talent.  <br />For those of you less neurotic than radiohead and I, don't let the lyrics deter you, which are rather on the intellectual side of rock.  Follow the music, let the lyrics work in later.  The music is powerful and creative, epic, sweeping, and ranging all speeds and rock genres--from dramatic shifts to slow builds, these guys know their stuff.  And their ability to manipulate sounds is spectacular.  Truly art.<br />Interesting note--I recommend all songs except the last, &quot;The Tourist,&quot; but my favorite is &quot;Let Down.&quot;  My favorite part of &quot;Let Down&quot;: listen in the final verse to the singer's voice, and notice how his words seem more instrument than vocal.  Specifically, it sounds to me like he's singing violin.  It's amazing, and just goes to show the music control this band commands.
B00005JKCH|4.0|What kind of movie is Spider-Man? Are you sure you really want to know? This movie is not for the weak of heart...<br /> Summer 2002, millions of die-hard Marvel comic fans were treated to seeing one of their heroes come to life on the big screen. Spider-Man. When I first saw the preview for Spider-Man, it was right before viewing my first PG-13 movie - Lord of the Rings (Another movie for another review). When confronted by the action scenes of the movie, and the grotesque view of the Green Goblin's face, my first thought was \\"Ew gross, another dumb blow-'em-up flick.\\" followed by \\"When will they stop with the previews and just show Lord of the Rings?\\" <br />When the movie came to theaters, however, I checked out some of the reviews at Focus on the Family's Plugged-in website and found that, while it did contain blow-'em-up action scenes and grotesque goblin faces, it did not contain the other junk that usually goes with such movies: swearing every ten seconds by the clock, and more skin than a hospital DOCTOR typically sees. So, after securing permission from my parents, we went to see it. In case you are thinking of seeing it but don't know for sure, or if your kids are hitting you up to go see it, here is as detailed of a review as I can give about the movie's good points and bad points, from the perspective of a 16-year old Christian.<br />In case you are like I was, not knowing about the general basics, here they are:  Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and is transformed into...Spider-Man. Just in time, because Norman Osborn, scientist for OsCorp has just turned into a raving lunatic because of his reckless Human Performance Enhancers test...on himself. Peter/Spidey chooses to protect the city of New York, and ends up in a fight to the death with The Green Goblin. <br />GOOD POINTS: As has been said in other reviews, Spider-Man draws a distinct line between good and evil. When Spider-Man misuses his abilities and refuses to stop a fleeing robber because it \\"wasn't his problem\\" tragic events result. His Aunt recites nearly all of the Lord's Prayer at one point. There are several expressions of \\"Thank God for you\\". When offered a chance to join the Green Goblin, Spider-Man chooses good. The Green Goblin, in fact, is portrayed almost as a demon possession of the father. From a purely secular standpoint, the movie is excellent, with its dazzling special effects, allowing us to see and swing along with Spider-Man through New York City. The soundtrack music by Ben Elfman is but the icing on the cake. The story and plot are also very well formed, but occasionally poorly written. The relationship between Peter and Norman Osborn is especially interesting. When Norman is sane, he accepts Peter as a fellow science whiz and almost like a second son. (Then they both go don their respective costumes and beat each other up.) Harry Osborn, Peter's friend, tells Peter at the end that \\"Spider-Man must pay\\" for something Harry thinks Spider-Man did, he then says \\"But thank God for you Peter. You're the only friend I have.\\" The door is left WIDE open for Spider-Man 2.<br />BAD POINTS: Violence is a key factor. In an attack, Green Goblin drops a bomb-like object to kill his former employers who fired him, and, in a gruesome manner, dispatches them. Spider-Man and Green Goblin slug it out several times, as well as the mandatory explosions and city chaos/blow-'em-up stuff previously mentioned. One key character (who I cannot name) is gored by a blade, nearly bloodless, but intensely violent. Several bad words are used, but unnecessarily so, sadly. The sweet aunt tells the uncle to get off the ladder before he falls on his...um, patootie. I don't remember the D-word being used, but at one point someone makes a remark that is translated \\"You are really making me angry\\". Kirsten Dunst, Spider-Man's honey, is nearly always immodestly dressed, or as I like to say \\"HEY! WHERE'S YOUR SHIRT!?\\" At one point she is chased by four hoods who have obviousintent. Spider-Man rescues her, and they kiss as they rain pours down. Dunst's shirt gets...wet, shall we say. When Peter, after realizing his super strength, goes to a wrestling rink to win the [money]prize, there are several severely immodestly-clad women, but it's not entirely emphasized, and otherwise, there is no nudity or immorality, implied or other.<br />MY THOUGHTS: Kids shouldn't see this movie, in my opinion. If it weren't for the bad language, and lack of clothes (\\"Pants don't cost THAT much, do they?!\\") it would be better, but the fact is that it isn't. For those who know what to be on guard for, it's a great watch.<br />\\"Whatever life has in store for me, I will always remember these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift; my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man.\\"<br />SPIDER-MAN TRIVIA FUN FACT: Stan Lee makes a cameo as a citizen hero who saves a little kid from falling city wreckage. <br />SPIDER-MAN QUESTION: If Spider-Man wears that suit, how does he climb the walls? He has his climbing burrs on his hands covered! <br />SPIDER-MAN QUESTION 2: WHERE DID SPIDY GET THAT ELABORATE SUIT?
B00005JLXC|4.0|After the hugh success of SPIDER-MAN, it was obvious to many film observers that superhero films were back in vogue in a major fashion.  DAREDEVIL is the first film since SPIDER-MAN to test that theory and, while the film isn't perfect, it doesn't disappoint.  This movie tells the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who lost his sight when his eyes are exposed to toxic waste in childhood.  However, his remaining senses are amplified to a superhuman degree.  When his father is murdered by mob enforcers, Murdock decides to fight injustice in his own unique way.  By day, he works as a lawyer while he metes his own dark brand of justice nightly as the red-garbed vigilante, Daredevil.  Eventually, he meets and falls in love with the shipping heiress, Elektra (Jennifer Garner).  However, both of them are drawn into tragedy when they become unwittingly involved in the schemes of the city's crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his half-crazed assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell).  <br />At first glance, Affleck would be an unconventional choice for a superhero lead as he tends to play affable, yet somewhat bland, leading men-types, but he pulls it off quite well. You can believe that this is a man who is driven to fight crime while fighting his own inner demons. Also, with so many other characters competing for attention, Affleck succeeds in making and keeping the character as a major focus in the film.  This is opposed to the Batman films where the hero was lost among the villians and supporting characters. Garner is both beautiful and lethal as his love-interest. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin doesn't have an awful lot to do, but he does make the most of his appearances as the man-mountian behind the crime syndicate.  Colin Farrell is probably the only actor in the film who camps things up a bit as Bullseye, but he succeeds in making him a character to be feared even when we chuckle at his quirks.  <br />Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson obviously has a love for the material, having adapted it from the classic Frank Miller-written comics.  He also keeps the film going at a good clip, keeping the film at just over 100 minutes.  However, it would've been nice to see some character motivations more fleshed-out.  The plotline where Joe Pantoliano's newspaper reporter is looking to expose Daredevil is practically glossed over and it would've been nice to see more of the Kingpin's motivations. But this is mere quibbling on my part.  Johnson and his cast treat the material with respect and the film is never allowed to drag. Indeed, it succeeds where the last 2 Batman films failed in presenting its dark hero.  While DAREDEVIL probably won't reach the heights achieved by SPIDER-MAN, it is still a worthy entry in the superhero derby. Definitely one to recommend.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Yeah, those girls, besides what they're very pretty, they really have created a new kind of music. I really love the music what those girls sing
B000088E6D|5.0|Our being in a society that embraces musical trends rather than true musical talent, I think we are ready to begin to just enjoy the sheer beauty of a great voice, melody and rhythm. Michael Buble performs not just the crooner songs but also rock and pop with a little bit of an edge, which gives him the definite edge over the likes of Harry Connick Jr. He is combination of Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. This is the best album I have heard in a long, long time. There is hope after all!
B000002KD9|5.0|I'm gonna get this off my chest first.  To be honest I have never been a huge Neil Young fan.  Don't get wrong he has done some great stuff throughout his musical career but so have his peers like Stephen Stills and Graham Nash etc; (sometimes they've done better things) and for whatever reason they do not get as much recognition.  However I felt I hadn't really given Neil a chance.  So I decided to pick up two of Neil's most critically acclaimed albums: 'Harvest' and of course 'After The Gold Rush'.<br />Fresh of the success of Deja Vu, Neil Young decide to conquer more ground in 1970 on his own.  'After The Goldrush' was recorded and released to a 'any type of material from CSN&amp;Y' hungry public.  The album was a monster sky rocketing Neil into new levels of super stardom.  <br />It wasn't just hype either.  'After The Goldrush' has some great music on it.The first four tracks are truly gold. Opening with TELL ME WHY; a nice charming acoustic piece.  The title track AFTER THE GOLDRUSH has some awesome lyrics.  ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART is beautiful and of course everyone knows the classic rocker SOUTHERN MAN which rocketed up the charts that year.  TILL THE MORNING COMES is a short ditty that is pleasing but could have made way for an actual song.  OH, LONESOME ME is a slow paced country piece.  It's beautful but a tad depressing for me.  DON'T LET IT BRING YOU DOWN is another classic here.  BIRDS is another beautiful piano piece with excellent vocals.  WHEN YOU DANCE YOU CAN REALLY LOVE is another great rocker.  While I BELIEVE IN YOU is a laid back country rocker with some good guitar and lyrics.  The final track CRIPPLE CREEK FERRY is another short yet pleasing ditty.  However like I said with TILL THE MORNING COMES, it could have made way for actual songs.<br />Overall 'After The Goldrush' is a classic.  If you want to go back to 1970 this is a good CD to take you there.  At first I didn't really like this album.  However after a few more listens I realized the excellence this album possessed.  The lyrics are wonderful.  Neil Young could really write some good music!  He knew how to do a beautiful country ballad and he defiently knew how to rock!  Highly recommend!
B000007T1M|5.0|This is the greatest album I have ever heard... The music is a mixture of raw anger and political distortion that rages out against any sort of typiscopagraphy.  It doesn't allow the mind to settle down and be vulnerable like so much music today.  Its' sound ranges from a hip-hop sancet fest to melodic rucus and the guitar styles of Tony Lommi (from Black Sabbeth) on track 6 are amazing.  It's the most insane self expression I've ever heard with a guitar.  The man's nuts.  Johnathan Davis also puts his spin on things on track 9... emotional, moving, and inspirational, I say.  I was almost brought to tears while listening to it for the first time.  Overall, the album was beautifully crafted to be the funkiest thing I've ever heard.  I recommend it to those of you that enjoy the music stylings of bands like Linkin Park, Alice In Chains, An Elephant In The Courtyard, and Phish.  Enjoy!
B00005N5SF|3.0|Volume 34 of the Star Trek DVD series contains two episodes that have been considered good cause they were supposedly very risqué during the time they aired.  Partly because each has it's own \\"landmark moment in American television\\".  In reality these moments are barely noticable and these two Trek episodes are just as mediocre as the rest that came out of the third season.<br />PLATO'S STEPCHILDREN opens this one.  Yeah I know. I've heard it a thousand times: \\"tv's first interracial kiss\\" between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols.  The truth is (according to Shatner himself) that two scenes of this were shot. One that was actually a kiss and the other that wasn't.  The latter was chosen in the original airing and they have never bothered to put the actual kiss in any reruns.  Therefore technically there is nothing special about this one.  The plot is typical Star Trek and this episode showcases some of the actors most embarassing moments.  Still this is good for a laugh.  Especially when the dwarf Alexander mounts Kirk like a horse and our good Capt. begins to 'neigh'.  Apart from those embarassing moments and a few touching acting scenes between Kirk and Alexander this episode is pretty forgettable.  <br />The second episode here is WINK OF AN EYE which fairs little better than PLATO'S STEPCHILDREN.  For whatever reason I have always felt the sound in this one was muffled.  Maybe it was just me?  Anyways the supposed off camera sex scene between Kirk and the girl isn't very noteworthy.  As a matter of fact I didn't even notice it until another Amazon.com reviewer mentioned it!  The plot to WINK OF AN EYE is interesting but in the long run it's merely the Star Trek crew being invaded by bizarre aliens once again.  As I said many times before, it's been done!  Anybody else notice that the camera work of this episode was almost always on a slant?  Just a thought...<br />Overall these two episodes are definetly watchable but I find neither them are as special as they claim to be.  Keep in mind these were released in 1968 so perhaps they were considered more shocking back then but I find it hard to believe since Star Trek's ratings and popularity were at an all time low when they aired.  Not the best but it's classic Trek so go on try it!  Recommended!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I sort of stumbled upon T.A.T.U. when one of my friends heard them on the radio and spent the next two days trying to hear their song again. I happened to be in the car with her when she succeeded and 'All the Things She Said' came on the radio. I went out and bought the album, without hearing any of the other songs, two days later. Each song has such good messages and mixed in with really good electronica sound- I've had the cd for two months, I still can't stop listening to it. I'll hold my breath for what they will produce next.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Goldeneye not only is the best Bond movei of all time, it came at the best time, Bond fans had been waiting since 1989 when the so-so License to Kill was released...and they definitley filled the gap.  This is a combination of excellent action scenes, funny punch lines, and the best villian since, Auric Goldfinger.  Alec Trevalyan, a former MI6 agent, is actually the head of a terrorist orginazation, Janus, where he also has General Ouromuv, the head of space divison for the Russian military, as well as Xenia Onatopp the beautiful assasian for Janus and former Russian military pilot.  We are also introduced to CIA agent Jack Wade a very likeable, humerous character, and Valentin Zukovsky, a Russian mafia group leader who becomes an ally of 007 on this mission.  And Judi Dench plays an excellent M and puts a twist on the mood of the movie and the future movies.  The action scene on the Russian streets with Bond in the tank is awesome and original.  Brosnan is, in my mind the best Bond ever, w/ Connery in second.  He is the best of all the other Bonds, he has Connery's suave approach, Moore's sense of humor and Dalton's seriousness as more of an assassian than a spy.  Goldeneye also has the best line in it since Goldfiner's \\"No Mr. Bond I expect you to die\\" line.  Where he and Natalya Siminova have just escaped from a train bomb and she asks him if he knows who to disarm the weapon and he responds \\"I suppose that depends on what weapon you're talking about disarming\\".  Goldeneye is an action packed adventure with an incredible opening sequence and it is a very worth-while buy.
B00005JLXC|5.0|I went into this movie not expecting much based on the previews, and came out of the theater thinking it was the third greatest comic book movie ever X-Men and the first Batman being the top two, but this one may tie in my book with Batman. This beats Spiderman which  I feel wasn't as good as people made it sound. I liked it because it was not the typical comic book movie it was dark and had more of an R rating edge to it. The best performance would not be Ben Affleck, but Colin Ferell his part was shorter then I thought it would be but in a few scences you almost root for his character. Michael Clark Duncan is well fitted for the roll of Kingpin, Jennifer Gradner is sexy and dangerous as Electra, and Ben Affleck is not my pick for the roll but is ok as Daredevil. The special effects are no different from Spiderman for the most part of movie, but the fight with Kingpin at the end is one of the best special effects fights ever. If your a fan of the first two batman movies before their dwon fall with the two you should check this out, lets hope with the sequals it won't go the same route as Batman did.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is slowly but (hopefully) surely doing things that his fans have requested:  live albums, filmed concerts, TV appearances, and this box set of unreleased tracks.  A few of these songs are B-sides which may have gained some popularity during the Born in the USA Days, but most of them are unknown unless you've collected bootlegs over the years (I haven't, so these were knew to me as I suspect they were/will be to most fans).  The early demos are really only good for historical value, and I would rather have had 4 original songs than these.  Disc 4 is the weakest material, with the songs often sounding dated and even identical to one another.  Not Bruce's most fertile period, but still some interesting and even good stuff on that disc.  Discs 2 and 3 are the best, with some from Darkness, The River and BIUSA, arguably Bruce's best song-writing periods. (Hmmmm...wonder if that has to do with the presence of the E Street Band?)  Some of these were no great losses when they were kept off of the original albums, but many of them make you wonder what could have been if he had included them.  My biggest complaint is that most of the discs have lots of time left on them, and Bruce could have easily included more unreleased songs (and we know you have it out there, Bruce).  It's not like anything I've heard from him would ever constitute as &quot;filler&quot; to pad the length of the album.<br />All of these songs are listenable, and many of them approach and achieve the greatness of Bruce's better known catalog.  If you're a new fan, I'd start with the original studio albums and the two live albums with Bruce and the E Street Band but this still belongs in your collection.  Hopefully we'll see a Tracks Vol. 2 in a few years.  Until then, there's plenty of music here to keep us happy.
B000069AUI|5.0|I am a new convert to the world of Coldplay, and I must say that they deserve all the accolades they've been given. I just hope it's not too much pressure for them. Coldplay specializes in modern rock-oriented mood music, heavy on the balladry and gushing with soul and emotion, with a resulting unique and honest sound. Singer Chris Martin has a very unconventional style and conveys pure emotion with ease, his tone of voice speaking even more deeply than the lyrics. On the other hand, the surprisingly heavy drumming of Will Champion keeps the songs rooted in rock structure and prevents than from drifting off into new age territory. In fact, Champion's often harsh drumming, along with occasionally jarring sounds from the other musicians, help to remind you through juxtaposition just how beautiful the music of Coldplay really is. The most rocking song on the album, &quot;A Whisper&quot; is a little clumsy but otherwise the album is a seamless tour-de-force of emotion and beauty that is nearly creepy in its effect. Winners are the bluesy and ominous &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; the plaintive and honest &quot;In My Place,&quot; and the aching piano-based dirge &quot;Clocks.&quot; I hope Coldplay aren't scared from the scene by all the public praise that they surely deserve.
B00004Z459|5.0|Here's the deal....Linkin Park is the best. WHo would give one of their songs a 6/10? .......uuhh no!The guys are the best, they sing the best songs, and everyone can relate! Buy this, you won't regret it!
B000006SBY|3.0|For real Bryan Adams Fans, this album is a must-have. You can hear the raw and simple songs from his early years, as a starting point from which his later music has been developping. Altough it is much different from his current smooth songs, you can hear the young Bryan and still recognize the style he developped throughout his career. This album is worthwile buying. Especially the first song (Hidin' from love) is as good as his later &quot;straight from the heart&quot;, but it swings like &quot;summer of 69&quot;. Rocky sweet...
B00005YW4H|5.0|Just buy it, it's wonderful!! You won't regret it, it was worth every penny.  She has a soulful voice and some really great songs.  I'd say she sings ballads with a kind of folky, jazzy, country twist.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I first heard about Tatu from a friend.  I downloaded their single and watched their music video for &quot;All the Things She Said.&quot; That's when I had a new favorite artist.  I dowloaded their songs in Russian and English.  If you like electro/techno music and don't mind their song's contents, you'll probably fall in love with them too.  Their songs on this albums have unique rhythms and their vocal abilities are awesome(don't believe what others said!)  I suggest that everyone who is still reading this, to listen to their music before you judge them.  Don't base singers only on their image.  If you like them in English, you should hear more of their songs in Russian. I can't understand why Americans don't largely embrace songs that aren't in Enlgish(with exceptions of Spanish songs.)  We need more music like Tatu to bring more language into our mainstream music...Here's a little story about my love for Tatu and foreign pop music.  I am a freshman taking German as my foreign language.  When my teacher introduced my class to a German artist, I fell in love with the music.  I am now into Russian and German music, although I cannot understand a lot of it.  Tatu has sparked my interest to learn more languages.
0792844890|4.0|Spaceballs was one of the truly towering movie experiences of my youth. Forced to read during one of those interminable home room \\"quiet reading\\" times of my sixth grade school year, I first encountered the novelization of this movie. It was pretty funny...but it was not the movie (which I later rented).<br />The comedy of Mel Brooks has always been sheer buckshot. There are no \\"smart bombs\\" in his arsenal. He throws everything he's got out there and if it hits, so be it.<br />Spaceballs hits consistently.<br />From Druish Princesses, Colonel Sanders, and Schwarz jokes (which inspired some pretty stupid crank calls-before caller I.D.) to Dark Helmet and Pizza the Hut-this movie is hilarious. Even Joan Rivers has some good lines.<br />This movie specializes in the kind of one-liner that you will find yourself quoting (often inappropriately) for years to come. I would place Spaceballs somewhere between Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Princess Bride in my Pantheon of \\"quotable\\" movies. I have never been able to confront plain yogurt without my thoughts drifting to this movie.<br />For those of you wondering whether you should upgrade from a VHS copy to a DVD the answer is a definite yes. The commentary alone is worth the price of admission. The menu screen is priceless.<br />Before I go, I must make a nod to Rick Moranis. Spaceballs is probably his second best movie after Strange Brew. The role of Dark Helmut shows him at the height of his comedic powers. The final battle with (as he says it) \\"Loooone Star\\" still leaves me rolling with laughter.<br />God has a sense of humor. Otherwise we wouldn't have movies as great as Spaceballs. Get a copy today and share in the cosmic laughter.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This Cd is one of the better ones i have purchased in the last few month's, it has exceptionally good music with no profane language in it, but that doesn't mean it reduces it's quality, it's safe for listener's of all ages and it can be purchased for the low price of 9.96
0451191153|4.0|I know it is against everything Ayn Rand stands for by writing this review, but I will do it anyway.  Her works were written solely for her own sense of achievement and for no other reason.  Thus, the theme of her writings is finding the greater good in the man who can throw all opinions and criticisms of his actions aside and achieve only for himslef in a completely selfish manner.<br />This particular novel centers around the cultural arts, primarily architecture, and one man's struggle to break the mold of traditional designs.  This man is Howard Roark.  He is Rand's ideal man.  He designs and builds only for his own ego and the satisfaction of having done it himself.<br />But, the novel was so much more than that.  It outlines Rand's overall lack of respect for compassion and selflessness.  She, as do I, beleives in a world where all mankind must make do for themselves.  Man is to survive solely on his entrepreneurial insticts and his inner spirit.  All the obstacles that are thrown in front of man on his way to achievement must be overcome only by strict resolve and determination, not by conforming.<br />I enjoyed this book.  Yes, it was lengthy.  Yes, it was difficult to stick with at times.  I'd like to give no rating in honor of Ayn Rand and that it should not matter what I think, or write about the book, but since I have to, it's a Four Star.<br />I would recommend Atlas Shrugged in addition to those who enjoyed this book, or in favor of The Fountainhead as an intro to readers who have not yet been blessed with the writings of Rand.
0316096199|5.0|Alice Sebold's memoir was initially difficult to read due to its graphic subject matter.  However, I found it an invaluable description of how a person experiences trauma, and more importantly, how a person works through their experience over the years to become a better person.   It is clear that surviving a horrific experience is only part of the process.  The main theme of Ms. Sebold's book, that &quot;you save yourself or you remain unsaved&quot;,  appears to be a wake-up call to victims of traumatic events, in my opinion.  She is saying that it is not as easy to move past terrible events as people expect you to do, that it may take years, but it CAN happen, if a person is willing to try.  So, although it was traumatic reading at first, the overall theme of Lucky was positive.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Yes, it's a cliche to say \\"at times i forgot i was listening to a live cd!!\\" but i really did. During \\"The dance of eternity,\\" i had the scenes from a memory cd case lying on my bed, and for 10 seconds i thought it was the studio version. There's not enough to be said about this cd. All the members do a phenomenal job. The \\"through her eyes\\" with a new solo in it is much better, \\"Silent Man\\" with all members playing is really cool, \\"learning to live\\" is just incredible. Portnoy's drumming at the end of \\"finally free\\" (the fill part) is astonishing. Change of Seasons is really cool.. it never ceases to amaze me that these guys can play their best for 3 hours and never skip a beat, riff, bassline, or whatever. The only thing that i thought was bad is in fatal tragedy, Portnoy and Petrucci mess up during \\"there can be no turning back/there can be no peace of mind..\\" but Petrucci makes up for it with a killer solo. Its worth your money if you like dream theater, without a doubt.
0446677450|1.0|In interview after interview, Kiyosaki never divulges how much money he actually has or makes from his investments.  He does not use proper real estate terminology and looks confused if a real estate pro asks a pointed question - which usually results in Kiyosaki quickly turning tail.  His claims regarding education and armed forces service are suspect.  And believe it nor not, he has NEVER revealed who his Rich Dad is!  You would think that at some time he would pay homage to the 'man' who taught him everything, but not once has this occurred.<br />He also gives some very bad advice in this book - casually mentioning making several lowball offers of 50% market value for some properties.  In real life, such an offer would be considered an insult.  He mentions how rich people are better to have as friends since they can give you inside information on companies, allowing you to make better decisions regarding a company's stock.  That's called insider trading and is very much illegal.  And it's a really crass way to look at your relationships with people - whether they can help you get rich rather than be fulfilling friends.  He also advises to buy multiple rental properties in multiple states (why? so you can pay more people to take care of them?) and that you can use a business to buy yourself a Corvette or a Rolex (try explaining that to the IRS).<br />This book is a sham, and did not start selling well until someone affiliated with multi-level marketing Amway (a questionable company that is pretty much a pyramid scheme) bought a bunch of copies.  If you are truly interested in real estate, check out John T. Reed.  His website also rates all the real estate gurus and he has devoted some time to write a scathing review of Kiyosaki after reading his book.<br />So... no one knows how much he makes, he can't answer simple real estate questions, no one knows who Rich Dad is (and many people have tried)...  smell a rat?
B000002UAI|4.0|I listened to this album last night after getting a new turntable.  I adore the Beatles version of &quot;Words of Love&quot;, and have always though &quot;Baby's In Black&quot; was an underrated gem.  Hearing those voices again made me happy and sad at the same time.  Knowing how quickly this was &quot;patched&quot; together, and how tired and frazzled they were at the time, it is an amazing achievement.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is the hardest stuff ive heard since nookie dropped!i used to hate heavy metal until i heard these two gems!Man if i had to pick between the chocololate star fish or the hot dog flavored water, i couldnt decide! I give thsi baby 5, VERY HEAVY stars!<BR>If you like this check out this new band linkin park, i got a feeling they'll both make it to the heavy metal hall of fame!
B000007MVD|5.0|Those two words sum up why I enjoy this disc even more than the 3 Anthologies.  Listening to it I can envision being a girl in 60's England listening to the BBC.  The Beatles really seem to be having a lot of fun, and the performances are outstanding.  I get chills hearing their cover of &quot;Soldier of Love&quot;.  A must have for anyone's collection to understand what it was all about.
B000000LZV|5.0|Of course this is an immortal album that could be filed under your genuine American Road Classic, an incomparable collection of songs by three dudes in a studio for two days in a marathon recording session. <BR>    But wait. I have a problem with this CD. Why, SST, isn't the great song &quot;Mr. Robot's Holy Orders&quot; included on this? &quot;Force fed, sifted, tin can, turn-handled, pop it. Pull toyyyyyy.&quot; It's a really rocking song, and it's much more essential that the conga jam that opens side 2. <br />      They also took out a great cover of &quot;Ain't Talkin' About Love&quot; that you can hear their other take of on &quot;Post Mersh vol. 3&quot;. <BR>      Still, you should definitely, definitely get this. Trade in your Beastie Boys CDs and get a real rock n' roll album that matters.
0684833395|3.0|I found the book, like a majority of the characters in Catch-22, crazy. Basically, after 80 pages, the story was still stagnating. There were plenty of quirky, rebellious characters but all the absurdity just didn't come together for me.  Yeah, there was Yossarian who was paranoid about getting killed, Hungry Joe who yelled in his sleep, Aadvark the navigator who couldn't navigate... So?<br />I kept asking myself, what the hell were all of them doing? Where was the story going? Nowhere. The characters were simply busy being eccentric amidst the madness of war. Which perhaps was what Heller was trying to portray.  Afterall, it was only 10 years after WWII when the book was first published and I guess it connected with a lot of readers then.  The message behind the book is still relevant, no doubt - but apart from the anti-war and anti-establishment theme, I felt Heller didn't have much else to offer. Mildly humorous at times, but sadly, the storyline just didn't progress with enough purpose for my taste.
B00005JLRR|3.0|I feel we cannot judge this film fairly until the director's cut of this film is released.  They hired the writer of \\"Gladiator,\\" the master of the multi-layered epic film and then filmed his long complicated script.  Then the studio insisted that they cut the movie down.  This left many plot threads dangling and questions unresolved.  I know from reading various articles there were more scenes developing B-4's character, explaining the political dealings on Romulus, expanding upon the mental violations of Troi, giving Worf some more to do, looking into Picard's psyche, and expanding the one-second cameos of Wesley and Guinian.  These scenes would have addressed many of the fan criticisms toward the movie and made the storyline feel more complete.  Why hire the \\"Gladiator guy\\" if you don't want an epic film.  Show the full thing.  Fans would much rather see a longer epic film than a short choppy one.  This is probably why there is not much repeat view.  The fans know there is a longer film out there and there waiting for the DVD to see it.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|When first hearing \\"All the things she said\\", i was just taken back. The song was so catchy and was full of great melodies and lyrics. Though their artificial lesbian relationship leaves one to think of how desperate they are for a huge male fan base (they both have boyfriends), i, being a male, didn't truly care; mainly because the album is so great. \\"Not gonna get us\\", \\"All the things she said\\" and \\"Can u see me now?\\" are 3 of the best songs ive heard in a while, and being russian myself, i can even understand some of \\"Ya soshla s uma\\" and \\"nas ne daginyat\\". Some of the songs leave you thinking \\"why???\\" such as \\"Malchik gay\\" (what the hell?) and \\"how soon is now?\\" but altogether the album is worth the price. Its a new sound, rather techno, yet also a mix of pop rock and r&b which makes Tatus sound so original and great. This album is worth it, so check it out.
B000066NW0|5.0|Definently, this is a great cd. The best. I've had it for a while, and I can't stop listening to it. Her music just means so much. To a song writer like myself, she is way insperational. Im not kidding, this is the best cd i have ever heard or ever will..at least untill her next album comes out!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I know it may seem a little extreme, but hey, I bought their CD. ^_^ Their sound is so refreshing, just like anime, ever song has a story. I can relate to the feeling given off by the songs, not being accepted because your different, because you don't meet peoples standards. Well, as t.A.T.u. would say &quot;F#%k Y$U&quot; if you think like that. Well anyway to the main point, it is refreshing and inspiring, especially if your tired of american music. Their music is spiritual and you should definatly check it out if you have any urge for something new and refreshing/spiritual. I almost felt as though I was there with them in Russia.
B00005U1YO|5.0|I heard the most tracks off of 'Come With Us' off of music programs on my comp. This is the first CD I bought by The Chemical Brothers, and is very good. Their first sinlge, 'Star Guitar', is a long song, but is a Techno/Rock kind of song, which in my opinion is The Chemical Brothers best kind of music. Another good song is 'Hoops' which also has a Techno/Rock feeling. I also love the beat, and I can repeat the song all of the time in my CD player. 'My Elastic Eye' follows 'Hoops' because it immediately goes to the track after it. I like that about Techno, how sometimes the same rhytms are used on one track, then the next track. Or how it goes to one song immediately after the song before that. Another good song is 'The State We're In.' This track has vocals from Beth Orton, their third collaboration with her, the first two being Alive Alone' on 'Exit Planet Dust' and 'Where Do I Begin' on 'Dig Your Own Hole.' This song has kind of a slow rock beat (which is what the other Beth Orton collaborations are like), and are all very good. The song following that is 'Denmark', which my brother says kind of sounds like music from a gay Rave (I disagree with him totally.)The track after that is 'Pioneer Skies, which my friend AJ sounds like a mix between Pink Floyd and Rush, which I like. And lastly 'The Test' is their best end song. On vocals is Richard Ashcroft,from the now disbanded The Verve, with their first collaboration with him. The song has a Techno/Rock type sound and is excellent, and I think this is their best end song. If you like Techno/Rock music, you will love The Chemical Brothers' 'Come With Us.'

B00000J8EK|3.0|'Surrender' is the third album I bought by The Chemical Brothers. The first song I heard off of the album was 'Let Forever Be', by their second collaboration with Oasis' Noel Gallagher. 'Let Forever Be' has a different feeling than other songs off of 'Exit Planet Dust' and 'Dig Your Own Hole'. It is more of a House/Rock beat, but it is not displeasing (though a lot of people think it is.)Another song which I heard off the album was another single called 'Hey Boy Hey Girl', which in my opinion is a good song, but not thier best. That song has a Dance/Techno vibe. A good but different type of song is 'Under The Influence', which is a Rave/Dance type song. The only vocals are 'I was under the influence', which in my point of view, gets kind of tedious after awihle. But the vibe of the song is catchy, where in the middle of the song the beat stops, then restarts four times in a row. Another Rave/Dance type song, which follows, is 'Out of control' which is probably the song with the most vocals on the album. The vocals are by a guy named Bobby Gillespie. And the first track, which happens to be my least favorite song, is 'Music:Response.' I do not like this song because it is co-written by a rapper who goes by the name Missy Elliot, who in my view, is a terrible singer. It has sort of a Dance/Rap beat (I extremely hate Rap because they sing way too fu**ing fast.) And the last song on the album is 'Dream On' with vocals by Jonathon Donahue. This is their least effort end song (I think all end songs on albums should go out with a great bang.)So if you like a House/Rave type vibe, get this CD. I just got this CD because I wanted to add it to my Chem. Bros. collection. If you don't like that type of music, I prefer their other three CD's, which are amazing.
B00003CX8J|2.0|X-MEN is one of the worst comic book flicks I have seen yet. The effects and acting in it was good but the characters and plot is bad. The thing I didn't like about this movie is the so called \\"X-MEN\\" act there the first \\"X-MEN\\", what I mean about this is that they are missing some of the X-men, where's Gambit, Beast, etc. Gambit was the coolest but evendentally the studio or the screenwriter didn't think he was cool. The other thing they should have did to make this film better is they should have stayed true to the comic book. Long Live GAMBIT!!
B00006L83N|4.0|If you're ready for some fresh melodic/symphonic heavy metal Symphony X \\"The Odyssey\\" has your fix! If your familiar with bands such as Queensryche, Dream Theatre, or Savatage you will want to pick up this red hot CD. Since their release of \\"V\\"The New Mythology Suite (2000), Symphony X are keeping busy producing a high energy of melodic imaginative symphonic metal. \\"The Odyessy\\", the bands 9th release since 1999, is packed full of highly technical and creatively aggressive melodic sounds. The New Jersey based band is definitely demonstrating their ability to stay focused using well-blended individual persistence and talent. Mike Romeo, who founded the band in 1994, was absolutely on fire. His heavy, distorted riffs and flying solos were coming down strong, however; I did notice some repetitious-riffs herd in other cuts. This 8-track symphonic adventure includes a 24-minute concept song that follows the epic adventures Odysseus. This is by far,their best work on the cd. \\"The Odyessy\\" is worth buying for this track alone. There was a wide mix of material here. This is where band really comes together. The keyboards added an interesting array of melodies and fit well into the arrangements. The rhythm section is strong the bass and the drums are very good in some songs and even better in others. If melodic heavy metal is what your after, then Symphony X `s \\"The Odyessy\\" is a must have cd that will satisfy your needs.<br />by Mike Romcoe<BR>UnRatedMagazine.com
B00005JLXC|5.0|DAREDEVIL is a great movie. The Effects are good and the stunts are excellent. I thought it was better that Spiderman and X-men. I thought it ranked up there with the first Superman and Batman. It confused me how Daredevil fought and after I saw this movie now I have an idea. This is a great comic book flick.
B000002JPA|5.0|This band is phoenominal.Dream theater is by far the best<BR>progressive rock/metal band that I've ever heard.<BR>&quot;Images and words&quot; I can listen to over and over agin.<BR>If you love band's that are very technical mucially<BR>you'll love these guys.Although there are alot of time<BR>changes and solo's and all that good stuff,Let me tell<BR>ya, you won't be dissapointed.Dream theater is I think<BR>one of the most underated band's and they should be<BR>even bigger than what the already are.They are a well<br />known,popular band and they have fans in every state.<BR>They put on a phoenominal show from beginning to end.<BR>in my opinion,it's better to see them live than to listen<BR>to their albums.Remember the saying, what you see is what <BR>you get, well with Dream theater what you hear is what you<BR>get.They play every song to a tee and they never miss a note.<BR>I would suggest to own this album it's a classic and also<BR>it's my favorite album by them.
0307120007|5.0|My son got this book when he was 2 or 3 months old. We would read it to him occasionally as he was getting older. When he got to be about 6 months, he could do most of the things in the book (play peek-a-boo with Paul, pat the bunny, etc.). Now that he is a year, he does everything -- he waves to Paul & Judy, he puts his finger in the ring, smells the flowers, etc. He loves this book so much, the cover has come off and we have to purchase another.<br />The great thing about this book is that there is something fun for them to do on every page, and it grows with your child. The only drawback I found is that it's not super-durable if your child really loves it and reads it over and over and over and over... :-)
B000002LPD|5.0|Many people may know this album best for the anthem/ballad &quot;Right Now&quot;, which to this day is a fantastic, heartfelt song.  But what many perhaps forget is that up until that track, which is the 9th track on the album, all of the tracks are pretty much hard rock.  This in fact is probably the hardest rocking Van Hagar album of them all.<br />Sure &quot;Poundcake&quot; is a bit immature, but is fun hard rock.  &quot;Judgement Day&quot; is an even better rocker, while &quot;Runaround&quot; is fantastically catchy.  &quot;Man On A Mission&quot; could easily be the theme of this album, as Van Halen seemed to be on a mission to flat-out rock on this album.  &quot;The Dream Is Over&quot; is an awesome anthem that starts off rocking hard but mellows out a bit at the chorus--the first sign of things slowing down on the album at all.  And for sure &quot;Top Of The World&quot;, while poppy, is a very positive way to end the album.  This is the closest thing to a second ballad on the album (after &quot;Right Now&quot;), but it still rocks as a closing track.<br />I love all of the Van Hagar albums, ranking only &quot;OU812&quot; under five stars (although that album certainly has many strengths as well).  While &quot;5150&quot; is still my favorite Van Hagar, this one is very close.  A fantastic rock album that was this great band in their prime.  Strongly recommended.
0316666343|5.0|This is a beautiful piece of work.  It addresses many horrific issues without brutalizing the sensibilities of the reader, but makes friends with the reader through familiarity and honesty and humor.  Rather than describe the book, let me tell you that if you do begin it and you do not like it right from the beginning, stop reading it and go elsewhere.  It is an original piece of art and originals, by definition, do not extend the comfort of the familiar.  Judging from this list of reviews, many people were not comforted.<BR>If you do join in the experience of the book, watch for Ruth.  To me, she becomes a common day saint, perhaps the only such being of these times, because she acknowledges and honors the victims of the everyday wars against everyday women.  She is my hero.
B000002IST|5.0|I love the wide variety of Genesis sounds on this album.  From their long, progressive, epic rock tracks to fun pop/rockers to serious, heartfelt ballads, it is all here...and it is all good.<br />The lead track and single &quot;No Son Of Mine&quot; in and of itself emphasizes the diversity to come on this album.  It has both a haunting classic rock and a melodic pop sound...an interesting and very good track.  The fun and hilarity of such tracks as &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot; and &quot;I Can't Dance&quot; is greatly offset by the track in between--the 10-minute epic storytelling &quot;Driving The Last Spike&quot;.  &quot;Never A Time&quot; and &quot;Hold On My Heart&quot; are both nice ballads, while &quot;Dreaming While You Sleep&quot; contains haunting thoughts and images from the point of view of a hit-and-run driver.  &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; is one of those socially concious songs like we have heard Phil Collins sing before, and it is a pretty powerful track.  &quot;Since I Lost You&quot; is very soft, sad, and heartfelt with its message content.  &quot;Fading Lights&quot;, long track that it is, seems like a fitting way to end the album, as Genesis under Phil Collins would fade away after this album.<br />People love to compare the older progressive rock Genesis to the newer pop-based Genesis.  Whatever your favorite version of the band is, there should be at least something that you like on this diverse album.  And for true long-time fans of the band, this should be a real treat, since it encompasses such a wide range of Genesis music from various eras.  Some may say that the album doesn't flow with its various styles, but to me the variety from one track to the next is what makes it so interesting and enjoyable to listen to.
B00006M183|4.0|Just over a decade ago they were upstarts, the                   'latest thing', although, even then, partially                    obscured by the wide shadow cast by their                         brothers in flannel, Nirvana. Now with a catalog                   of consistently excellent albums, Pearl Jam find                 themselves among the standard-bearers to                          which many young rockers aspire, or should.                       Riot Act is another solid work of thoughtful,                     reflective, driving, visceral rock and roll                       presented, warts and all, without embellishment,                  fuss or hype. Essential, minimal, and classic rock                instrumentation. No special guest appearances.                     A band in the purest sense. The stirring                         interplay, especially between the guitars                        (rhythm, lead and bass) of Gossard, McCready,                     Ament, and , occasionally, Vedder brings to the                   'older' mind that of Kantner, Kaukonen and                        Cassady of the Jefferson Airplane-with each                        player seemingly about to skitter off into his                   own space but somehow remaining lashed                           together by the centrifugal force of their                        combined performance. Nevertheless, the                           linchpin of this group remains Eddie Vedder. As                  the primary composer and lyricist , he is, in                     every way, the voice of Pearl Jam. Vedder's                       highly expressive quiver and roar remain among                    the distinctive sounds of rock, despite the fact                  that they have been imitated, but hardly                          duplicated, by what seems like every third rock                    singer of the last 10 years attempting, usually in               vain, to convey sincerity and passion. Pearl Jam                  succeed in their desire to convey sincerity and                   passion, along with anger, despair, desire,                       disgust, regret, and a litany of other elemental                   emotions. But, as with the best of all rock and                  roll, Pearl Jam ultimately project a feeling of                   hope. And these days you can't ask for much                      more than that.
B00005JLXC|5.0|I went and saw this movie the day it came out with one of my friends because she loves Ben and had to see it right away. It's not really my kind of movie (since I've never read a comic book) but I went anyways. The movie itself was pretty interesting. It wasn't great but it wasn't boring.<BR>Jennifer Garner was awesome in it. I would go see it again just for her
B00004WEJZ|2.0|As this is review number 124 I didn't care to read everyone's opinion regarding this movie.  Overall I think it's a decent film, leaning further to the campy style than Connery had in his previous Bond films.  I own a widescreen video and the widescreen dvd. I kept the video for one good reason:<br />THE DVD VERSION IS EDITED!<br />When Bond enters the casino after disposing of the tubby bouncer with a cigarette case (or bomb with a tino gyroscope) the entire scene where he meets Domino (playing Centapede) is gone! As is the following scene where he buys her a drink (another \\"Hard or soft?\\" moment), as is the next scene when Largo meets Bond and invites him to play Domination with him!  This entire sequence is cut! Why? I don't know. Maybe Atari objected.<br />If you insist on buying every James Bond dvd, by all means, buy it. But be warned: you're not seeing the entire movie!
B00003CXPJ|4.0|This movie has \\"Goofy\\" written all over it, but it was entertaining.  I'll admit that the \\"Eu-googly\\" joke was a bit over the top, but Stiller makes Derek Zoolander loveable despite his stupidity.  Although I think it was Owen Wilson who stole the show.  I can totally see him in that type of role.  He's got that good-looking, happy-go-lucky, means-no-harm funniness about him that totally suits the role of Hansel. The script is just goofy funny.  It was meant to poke fun at male models and the modelling world, but still highlights their appeal.  Overall, a great light-hearted no brainer flick to lift your spirits at the end of a bad day.  :)
B000001Y2U|5.0|Virtually all of these reviews talk about the lead singer, Marilyn. The problem with this is when I listen to the CD, I don't just stare at the cover of this record, or that of Mechanical Animals which would give me a better look at him. Basically, I don't look at pictures of the band when I'm listening to the CD, so the image doesn't really matter. I think the songs are excellent, and although I like Cake and Sodomy, and few songs on Holywood more than this, I think this is his most complete album. The first four tracks, Wormboy, Antichrist Superstar, 1996, Minute of Decay, the Reflecting God (after its ridiculous opening lines about ashtrays and burning like cigarettes), and the Man That You Fear are the best, but all of the songs are great. <BR>Now I'll make my mandatory statement about the people behind the music: One of the most interesting things I've ever read was Mr. Manson's claim that everyone focuses on the \\"evil\\" part of his name (Manson), and not the \\"beautiful\\" part (Marilyn). Judging by a number of these reviews, he's right. Many reviewers compare him to Charles Manson, but I didn't see any comparing him to Marilyn Monroe. I think everyone should at least try listening to this CD.
0783226845|5.0|When I first heard of this movie, I had no clue what it was about.  My friend and I saw a teaser poster with Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar dancing the tango labeled \\"Scent of a Woman\\".  Putting two and two together, we went into the theater thinking we were watching a love story until the movie started.  Whoops.  Despite my misgivings in the beginning, I was pleasantly surprised.  What I found was a riveting story of mentor-mentee relationship.  I love movies that involve the master taking young grasshopper under his wing.  Except master is not Mr. Perfect himself.  Both the student and the teacher learn from each other's weaknesses. And despite Lt Col Slade's struggle with his misfortunate blinding accident, his Army core values were still in tact. Hard-working and willing to give up a Thanksgiving weekend to look after an embittered retiree, Slade sees an underlying goodness in Chris O'Donnell's fragile, fence-sitting character, Charlie.  Like most young men his age, he was susceptible to peer pressure and could easily choose the wrong path as his friends had. Slade is blind but easily sees the temptation to compromise the boy's integrity and future. \\"This old bat has sharper radar than the Nautilus\\" Slade tells his young league.  He lays all the cards out for Charlie to see, but knew instinctively it was up to the boy to make his own decision.  Charlie eventually shows his true colors in the face of adversity. Like a good soldier, he never leaves his commander's side even when the danger is self-inflicting.  Character like that is a rarity in anyone and must be preserved! This prompts Slade to reciprocate his support for Charlie who is enrolled in a prestigious school reknowned for producing some of the most important figure heads in America.  \\"Be careful what type of leaders you're making,\\" he warns the school staff.  Charlie learns lessons in life that no school could teach him.<br />Underneath the tough exterior, there was a softer side to Slade.  He definitely had a thing for the ladies.  Instead of playing up a macho cassanova, \\"Mac-Daddy\\" persona predominate in a lot of films today, Slade is quite the charmer and gentlemen.  He's cultured, sophisticated, genteel and surprisingly knowledgeable about women's perfume.  Hence the film's title.  I find that warrior-poet quality incredibly sexy and appealing.  You can't resist a man who makes the tango look so easy and doesn't mind getting \\"all tangled up\\" with you.  A beautiful role played by Pacino earning him a well-deserved oscar which probably was most credited for by his empowering monologue in the end. This is by far his best role in a movie. <br />Lovely film.  Sweet, sad, romantic yet uplifting.  This is truly a classic for the ages.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Despite what some might say, there is nothing \\"chirpy\\" about the cover of \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" - it's even more melancholic than the original. Between the lyrics, their content, and the music, I would have to say that this is already one of my favorite albums. It's a terrific album. The pop/techno sound of the music has an ethereal quality to it. My only regret is that it's so short. I have no problem with their accents and am pleased that the Russian version of two of the songs are included on the disc. We could do with some more international influence. Whether or not this is a marketing scheme, this album is well worth owning. There is nothing empty or mediocre about it. It is touching and emotional, serious and poignant. \\"Malchik Gay\\" is the only lighthearted sounding song on the album, and even that has a somberness to it (if one listens to lyrics, as some people obviously do not). A very intense and passionate masterpiece. I hope T.A.T.U. succeeds.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is definitly the best thing to get for your money! This CD is sooooooo awsome, it shows what a great rapper Eminem is to really be able to express everything going on in this life (good & bad) on paper! Every single song on this track has a catchy beat and although some of his rhymes are a bit chilling you will get addicted and want more,more,more! That was how it was for me. The first time I heard \\"kill you\\" (the second track) I couldn't believe my ears! But then a day later it became my favoraite song! That's how Eminem is: the first time you hear him you are in total shock, but after a while you grow to love him!!!!!!
B00005JKCH|5.0|In the last decade, Hollywood has given us a bunch of bad popcorn movies that sometimes we wonder what the heck is happening with the most powerful film industry in the world.  Well, maybe I should leave out \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"X-Men\\", which were great entertainment flicks.  But here is one of the best movies of 2002: \\"Spider-Man\\".<br />This is perhaps the best popcorn movie I've seen in years.  Great performers, great characters, fantastic story.  It's got almost everything that a good piece of entertainment should have.  The story of a young boy -played here to flawless perfection by Tobey Maguire -who is stung by a super radioactive spider, and his life is changed forever.  His battle with one of his arch-enemies, The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, in a scene-chewing performance), is fantastic considering the bond between their corresponding alter-egos.  Peter Parker's secret crush to Mary Jane (lovely Kirsten Dunst) is perhaps what drew me closer to the Parker/Spidey character, not to mention the twist ending that reminded of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in \\"Casablanca\\".  I really love this movie.<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" came in the same year of \\"Star Wars-Episode II: Attack Of The Clones\\".  When I came out of the theater, after seeing Spidey in action, my heart was filled with fear because it made me wonder \\"a movie about a web-slinging, wall crawling superhero is gonna be better than a \\"Star Wars\\" flick?\\"  And I wasn't mistaken: this film is better than Episode II.<br />As for the DVD, all I have to say is that I love the documentaries; I love the profiles on director Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman; and I definitely love the gag reel with the bloopers.  This is a great DVD.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|T.A.T.U is an awesome band, coming from the country of Russia. There music will captivate you in a beautiful Mind blowing enigma of sounds and lyrics. There song \\"All the things she said\\", has already given them a name for them selves on MTV, Muchmusic, and MTV2. I personally would recommend anyone to this CD. Beleave me<BR>You won't regret it.
B000069AT7|5.0|This is arguably Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, and the presentation of this DVD package is superb.  This edition has the original 1982 presentation of the film: it's impressive how the story of a friendship between an Earth kid and an extra-terrestrial still touches us after twenty years.  I mean, this is a classic.<br />This package also has the longer version of the movie which, in my opinion, doesn't add up to the original.  The CGI E.T. moves nice, and the new F/X shots are quite attractive, but the I find the extra scenes unnecessary, and the edit on the shotgun leaves much to be desired; Spielberg might have disagreed with the idea of a shotgun aiming at Elliot (Henry Thomas) and E.T., but that gives a good sense of threat that keeps you on the edge.<br />As well as the soundtrack CD of John Williams' score, this anniversary edition contains a third DVD with plenty of extras: the documentary regarding Williams' conducting his score live is so fantastic that left with a desire of watching it completely, but there is the audio track on the remastered version DVD of the movie; there is also a documentary on the Williams/Spielberg collaboration, and a documentary regarding the anniversary of the film and the cast's memories of the filming.<br />This is a fantastic package that receives five stars.  Personally I'd give the original 1982 version its five stars, four stars for the remastered anniversary version, and five stars for the documentaries.  As for the soundtrack CD, read my review about it.
B00005MP58|5.0|A sort of eighteen century chick flick. This is an adaptation of Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; which was first published way back in 1816. This already sets a pretty definite mood to the film. Language can be difficult to understand for those who aren't used to it. Lots of formal bowing and that sort of thing. I personally, am pretty used to all this and can enjoy this movie without getting annoyed at all the formal language. I actually think it adds to the subtlety of the wit and sarcasm which both the film and the book possess.<br />The story is about the Bennet family living in Longbourne, England. Mr. Bennet married much lower in society and so most of his fortune has been lost and his five daughters need to marry wealthy men in order to stay alive, basically. This plot puts off a lot of people. I'm not sure why, but it does. So, let me say that this film is really very good. Jane Austen was a literary genious, in my humble opinion, and her wit and skepticism is conveyed very strongly through Miss Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), the heroine of the story. The hero is Mr. Darcy, played by Colin Firth who also played a Mr. Darcy in Bridget Jones's Diary.<br />The characters are so intriquite in this story. Each compliments the other in manner, appearance, and speech. My personal favorite is Mr. Collins, the bumbling clergyman who is keen on complimenting every one beyond what they deserve. He's so crazy and kind of oily and groveling, its really hilarious.<br />I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to give it a try. I can't really put it in a category. I guess, romantic comedy but also a certain amount of drama. And of course in a certain 18th century style.
0316666343|1.0|I admit that I have never read this book, but I read the excerpt and reviews etc. It is disgusting. No earthly human being has any right to write about Heaven, especially associated with what this book is associated with, having never been there. Also, especially because her description is twisted and untrue. Anybody that has ever been to sunday school or church, read the bible or believed in God knows that when you go to Heaven you will be happier than ever before, an that you won't long for earth, and that you will be sinless and pure. So if you're going to write a book about Heaven, which I think is just wrong, make sure your version isn't twisted and messed up. Nobody who writes a book will ever have a true interpretation of Heaven- it is one of those things that is wonderful and a true gift from God, but don't spoil it by rushing and using it, interpreting and writing books about it. That excerpt was upsetting. I suggest any knowledged or normal Christian look at this book with a disapproving eye. GOD BLESS YALL!
B00005JLSC|5.0|This movie blew me away. Not at first, maybe. I walked out of the theater and thought, \\"That was just a lit-tle weird.\\" But now, after two days, I realize how much I loved it. The most surprising success of the film, in my opinion, was Richard Gere. What a voice! He sounds like a genuine vaudeville singer. It's great. Very nasal and some how very American (whatever that might mean). I was very surprised and very pleased, especially since one of his most recent films was \\"Dr. T and the Women.\\" Thank God he's acquired/regained some taste.<br />Besides Richard Gere's singing, the best part of the film was the fantastic court scene. That was some superb directing and editing. I loved how they kept cutting back and forth, not just with the tap dancing (which was really fantastic: way to go Richard Gere!) but with the \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" sequence as well. They were very smooth and breath taking transitions.<br />As to Renée Zellweger, she seemed a little amateur next to Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere, but maybe this was just because her character had an amateur feel. A kind of frightened, naïve kid, really. Or maybe it's because she looks so young next to Zeta-Jones and Gere. Anyway, I still thought she was pretty good. Very Marilyn Monroe-ish at times. Eerily so at points. John C. Reilly's character was very pathetic and very loveable. I hope he dumped Roxie for good and found himself a loving wife. That's another thing that bothered me: Roxie's very self-obssessed behavior after the trial. \\"I can't believe they didn't even want my picture.\\" That was kind of a turn off. I guess it fits in with her character, but I still didn't like it.<br />In terms of music: \\"Razzle Dazzle,\\" \\"We Both Reached For The Gun\\" and \\"Cell Block Tango\\" were by far the best. I also really liked the \\"Nowadays\\" (finale song). The choreography was superb, and the costumes were pretty impressive. I still have \\"He had it coming, he had it coming, he only had himself to blame. If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it, I'm sure that you would have done the same\\" stuck in my head. I personally think I liked this film better than Moulin Rouge, although some disagree with me there. Anyway, I really liked this movie and I advise you all to see it before it leaves theaters. Hope it wins a few Oscars...
B000022TSY|2.0|I watched this the second time in film class in 1970 with a professor who claimed to have watched it 40+ times, teasing out the deeper nuances.  That seemed excessive even given the zeitgeist of the times.  Watching it once would be excessive now but for the insight it gives into the completely vacuous values of the 60's.  Some aspects of the 60's have held up well (Jimi Hendrix still sounds great), but this movie isn't one of them.  If you can listen to Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper babble with the other stoners on the commune about doing your own thing in your own time without bursting out laughing, you need more drugs.  I would give this one star but for the fact that the music is pretty good, it helped launch Jack Nicholson, and Fonda has gone on to do some very good movies and Hopper some great ones.
B00005JLXC|4.0|For those of you who know Ben Affleck as a lesbian-chaser/comedy-only guy, you just may be slightly shocked with his performance in \\"Daredevil\\".  In this comic-based film, Affleck assumes the role of Matt Murdock as well as the \\"justice to be served\\"-minded Daredevil.  But, as in many other comics, his character of Daredevil is hidden from the real world.  And his everyday disposition is portrayed through Matt Murdock, a lawyer.  But what is interesting about Matt is the fact that when he was a kid he was blinded; yet what blinded him only made him stronger in his other four senses.  Then soon after he lost his sight, someone killed his father.  But as he searches for revenge, he becomes more and more insecure about his role.<br />You must understand that this movie is based on a comic book.  And a comic book is meant mainly for kids to be able to understand.  So if you're thinking to yourself, partway into the movie, that the plot is kind of bogus--you're right.  It's meant to be that way.  As I don't want to spoil any of the movie for you, I won't tell you much of what happens.  But as you can imagine, Daredevil runs accross many foes and a few friends.  One of those friends is played by Alias' (on HBO) Jennifer Garner.  She (as the beautifully strong Elektra) becomes, after a impressive fight with Ben, friends with Matt.  But the life story of Elektra is not quite favorable, to say the least.<br />What really makes this movie excellent is not the plot.  It's the direction.  Mark Steven Johnson did an awesome job with, as I said before, a guy who didn't have much of an action background to support him.  But from what I saw on a VH1 All Access show, Affleck and a few others took around two months of training for their roles.  And it shows.  You don't have to be a genius to see that.  And if you're thinking to yourself that the scenes look too fake, you just don't understand.  Another big plus for the movie was the supporting cast.  It features, aside from Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan of \\"The Green Mile\\", Jon Favreau (who gives us some much needed comedy--without him that would've been something the film lacked), and Joe Pantoliano (\\"Memento\\" and \\"The Matrix\\").  There is also a cameo appearance by comic enthusiast and Ben's lifetime friend/co-worker, Kevin Smith.  And if you're a Kevin Smith fan you'll love his appearance as a forensic assistant.  I think Kevin was the only person to use a swear word in the movie.  And fitting it was.  Being that his movies are mostly curse words and vulgarity (not to say that's bad).<br />Although I did not see \\"Spider-man\\", I'm going to assume that \\"Daredevil\\" is somewhat similar to it.  I think that's a fair assumption.  The reason I gave this movie 4 stars, and not five, has to do with Kevin Smith.  Being the big Smith fan I am, I was disappointed to hear that his next project \\"Jersey Girl\\" was to be delayed.  It was delayed because Affleck wanted to play the parts in \\"Daredevil\\" and \\"Jersey Girl\\"; yet this one came first.  Call me shallow or call me stupid, but I don't think that's a way to treat a friend, or a girlfriend (Jennifer Lopez will be co-starring with him in \\"Jersey Girl\\", out this summer).  Anyway, you should see \\"Daredevil\\".  If you enjoy Ben Affleck, action or comics, then this movie is definitely for you.  It's a great action-packed movie with a great cast; and it's one of the best comic book stories I've ever been a part of.

B00004RD54|5.0|Picture the scene, it's a cold snowy friday night in New York, December 21st, 1973. You've just gotten off work and you've busted hump to get to the 2000 seat Academy of Music in time for the concert. There you meet up with all your fellow freaks and sit back inside the warm theater. You light one up. Suddenly the lights dim and the band onstage starts to jam. You look for lou, but he's not on stage. You're swept away by the twin guitars solos. Suddenly some one strolls on stage as the music reaches a crescendo. The crowd gets to it's feet, then those familar guitar riffs ... Sweet Jane! The spotlight shines center stage. The crowd roars!

B00003OSTV|5.0|We have been waiting for the DVD for years now particularly after much less popular titles from this genre such as Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments have since been released on disc.

B00007BH3Y|5.0|&quot;The Hours&quot; tells the story of three women in three different time periods -- 1923, 1951, and 2001. Their stories are interwoven exquisitely, and arch together in a profound, moving fashion. It is the best film of 2002. The score, composed by Philip Glass, tells the story of that story in such a beautiful way that, without it, the film would be a lesser entity, devoid of part of its essence.<br />This is like listening to a symphony, in 14 Movements. Having seen the film, this score will have quite a bit of meaning to you, but even if you haven't seen the movie, the score will should still resonate. It could easily be a stand-alone classical music piece. The tracks all have a similar sound, but yet, are uniquely different. This is a sad score, for it is a (mostly) sad film. Track 3, titled &quot;Something She Has To Do&quot;, is probably my favorite. So somber, so moving.<br />Philip Glass has received an Oscar nomination for his score for &quot;The Hours&quot;. It is well-deserved. His use of strings and piano are excellent. His ability to capture the feeling of the film is top notch. I can't recommend this score, or the movie it was written for, enough. The booklet which accompanies this music is quite comprehensive, featuring an introduction by Michael Cunningham, author of &quot;The Hours&quot;, and then a description of the three women in each of the time periods covered in the movie. <br />As a remembrance of the movie, or as a piece of music all its own, the score to &quot;The Hours&quot; is a sumptuous aural experience that should be treasured for the great achievement that it is.
0679601686|5.0|I cannot even hope to do justice to how well written this book is. For the reasons already stated here by others and many more I love this book! I have read it a good 10 times and I never seem to tire of it. Through a stroke of genius that is purely her, Jane Austen has created timeless characters that manage to capture your heart. The witty banter between Darcy and Elizabeth is always engaging and never fails to bring a smile to my face. Read this book. It is a must for everyone.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I am 33 years old and have been going to and renting (after the invention of VHS) films for the better part of 22 years.<br />I also grew up in South Philadelphia, which explains in part the fact that until 1999, my #1 film of all time was ROCKY (Part 1).<br />That all changed after a snowy day in late 1999 when I was fortunate enough to purchase a ticket to see this film.<br />I've easily seen 600-700 movies in these 22 years, many of which were good, some great films, but this one takes the cake.<br />I was hypnotized from beginning to end, and I now own the DVD and am equally hypnotized each time I watch it, almost 4 years later.<br />Kevin Spacey not only deserved the Oscar he won for Best Actor, but if they gave a Best Actor of the decade award, he would have won that for the 90's (and maybe in my lifetime.... since the late 70's).  His character, while a part of a great ensemble cast, was really , in the end, the driving influence of this unforgettable film.<br />Annette Benning was amazing as well, despite the fact that her character, in the end, was not exactly likeable or sympathetic at all.  She somehow ends the film as a somewhat sympathetic figure, which is attributed directly to Benning's performance.<br />The young actors (Birch and Bentley) are terrific in what amounts to a mature film about some very serious subject matter, they shine.<br />The really underrated performance in this film is that of Chris Cooper as Col. Frank Fitts, yet another example of why he is one of our great, lesser known actors.   Thankfully, since this film, he has gotten his notice, and some meaty roles in other big name films.<br />Lester Burnham will forever go down as one of the most lovable and remembered characters in American film history, and American Beauty will go down as one of the 10 best American films ever made.<br />Deservingly so on both ends.    If you haven't seen this film (what the hell are you waiting for), please do so immediately.<br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Binaural is Pearl Jam's attempt at an all out Classic Rock record, but unfortunately isn't quite classic enough. Being a huge PJ fan i regretfully place this as my least favorite PJ album. I just found most of the songs to be forgettable. Even the hard rockers like 'breakerfall', 'gods dice' and 'grievance' just seem to pass by with a soft buzz. Most of the other song's aren't bad, it's just that Pearl Jam have done much better. Binaural does have a couple of standouts though. 'Insignificance' is stunning and among PJ's best ever songs, and the haunting single 'Nothing as it seems' is also very good. Atleast Pearl Jam followed up thier most dissapointing album with one of the greatest tours ever.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Hole returned in the fall of 1998 with their first new album since 1994's LIVE THROUGH THIS, and the result was CELEBRITY SKIN. There were many changes before this album with Courtney Love, lead singer of Hole, and it shows on the album. Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumpkins lent his pen to 5 of the 12 tracks on SKIN. The topics on the album range from the music industry (like the infectuous \\"Awful\\" and \\"Boys on the Radio\\"), physical abuse (\\"Hit So Hard\\"), her late husband Kurt Cobain's suicide (\\"Reasons to Be Beautiful\\"). On SKIN it seems Courtney is screaming less and is singing with a more subdued voice, which works well with the material. The lyrics are confessional and deep, and it works well. One of my favorites is the subdued track titled \\"Dying\\", and \\"Malibu\\" is another highlight. \\"Use Once & Destroy\\" is an interesting song dealing with drugs, and \\"Heaven Tonight\\" is a fun pop type track. Other highlights among the set include the closing \\"Playing Your Song\\" and \\"Petals\\". Overall a strong album.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is simply a great album. Yes, the songs are long and slow paced. But if you don't have a short attention span, and maybe even if you do, you'll still love this album. I'd say that it's slightly better than Agaetis Byrjun, their previous album. The formula of their songs is obvious. They seem to follow a plot line and the longer they hold you in suspense, the more miraculous the end of each song is.
B000002JPA|3.0|Ok so this CD would be hard to define, I've read many reviews and listened to 2 of Dream Theater's CDs myself after being directed to listen to them by a reviewer on here. Now I could go all out and say OMG wow, what a CD, it's the best ever, but don't be silly. James (Kevin) Labrie, this could be classed as the case of David Lee Roth and Van Halen, his vocals are not exactly the greatest you'll ever hear and we do regress to the hair metal era in some places, this could be where DT made a mistake. However I'll give them it, the playing of their instruments is well, over the top, rather too mechanical in places, but they do actually get the mix right in some places on this album as on the Scenes From A Memory Album. Some of the songs do come as pleasing to the ear, BUT if you're not into certain songs, songs that are very heavy on the guitars and drums, then you could possibly skip them but that wouldn't be your money's worth would it? Hmmmm some of the more &quot;hair metal&quot; songs even sound a bit too simple &quot;Another Day&quot;, they come with lyrics that I agree aren't very thoughtful and if you hate &quot;hair metal&quot;, however melodic and relaxing this song may be then stay away because it is a bit cheesy, I love &quot;hair metal&quot; from certain bands but don't get me wrong, it all becomes the same in the end.<br />But not to focus too much on the things that might put you off. I know how much this band practice on their music and it shows, they have perfect technical ability on their respective instruments and can work wonders with them in that sense, BUT (I know another BUT lol) you can't focus too much on technical perfection in sacrifice of a song :'( we don't have the great hits of the past because of their technical ability, its the god damn SONG, i wish DT would read some of these less bias reviews. I like the band, some of their stuff is promising but never delivers, it seems to always go off into a big metal riffs and guitar solos with very intense drumming.<br />This album can be liked by people who pride in listening to technical perfection, but not people who deteste &quot;hair metal&quot; vocals and unimaginative lyrics, if you want Lyrics go talk to the late Freddie Mercury or even Jon Bon Jovi or Richie Sambora, their lyrics actually have some meaning, I've seen the effect that DT have, they have confused many people anyway. It get's 3 stars because it could be alot better but is a solid debut, I wouldn't try to categorise it into anything but technical perfection in need of a better vocalist DT my friends.
B000002U82|4.0|I feel that this IS the #1 overrated album of all time... not to say it's terrible, very far from it.  It is just not as good as the reputation it has.<BR>Pink Floyd, being an album-based band, needed to make the topic more clear in their songs.  Unlike The Wall, I had to look at the lyrics (specifically &quot;Us and Them&quot;) to find the meaning of it.  That's not to say I don't LOVE this album.  It sounds AWESOME and keeps getting better every time I hear.  It's more of the &quot;first-timer's&quot; album in the sence that; if your just getting into Pink Floyd, get it.  If you've been a Pink Floyd fan forever, you know what I'm talking about.<BR>First get the album, then get another album and see what I mean.  My favorite album from the band is The Wall just because the music tells the story better.  However, I still love this album, not as much as others, but still one of the best.<br />ALBUM BREAK DOWN:<br />Speak to Me/Breathe: Great start.  Begins with the pulsing heart beat then all the right sounds.  Nice lyrics and nice flow.<br />On the Run:  All music, sounds good with the running shoes in the background.<br />Time:  Best song on the album.  Maybe the best Pink Floyd song ever.  Kinda explains what the album's about.  The album is worth it just for this song... awesome.<br />Breathe Reprise:  Many times confused as the ending to &quot;Time,&quot; but its it's own song.  Good song, short but good.<br />The Great Gig in the Sky:  More music... all music.  Some woman yelling, but all music.<br />Us and Them:  Another gem.  Acually about war and sounds great.<br />Any Colour You Like: Again, more music.  Not the best all music track, but still alright.<br />Brain Damage:  Best &quot;going crazy&quot; song out there... can tell the album is ending and is just aweseome.<br />Eclipse:  Not the best ending to an awesome album, but still an awesome song.  Sounds superb and makes you think.  Wish you could make the ending out better though.<br />As you can see Idon't hate the album, just think The Wall is better.<BR> <BR>P.S.: Get it!!
B000002MY3|4.0|This was one of the biggest albums of the 1990's. Alanis came out of the blue with an album of raw and compelling pop/tunes that made the music buying public stop and listen. This monster has gone a whopping 16x platinum and was the biggest female album of all time up until Shania Twain overtook her a few years ago with &quot;Come On Over.&quot; <br />&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; spawned 6 hit singles over the course of 1995-1997. My favorite is the blaring &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; which launched her and this album. A definite 90's classic. Several more followe including the hugely successful &quot;Ironic&quot; and additional top 10 singles &quot;You Learn&quot; and &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; which displayed a slightly more pop approach to Alanis. &quot;All I Really Want&quot; was also a minor hit. Non-singles such as the heart-wrenching &quot;Perfect&quot; *a track I can relate to* are also good. &quot;Forgiven&quot; is also an interesting listen. <br />Of course, after a huge albu like this, Alanis's follow-ups have paled in comparison but have still been successes *FSIJ has gone 3x platinum and URS has gone platinum along with a gold Unplugged album.* If you don't already own this, it's definitely worth purchasing. Some of th best music of the 90's.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|i just saw this movie on hbo....and i was amazed!!!....this is a very different film (well everything that comes out of michael mann vision is quite different!). i just have to say that i loved it. yes, it's slow , long and inconcistant, at is not an action film!  if you want action, get a Jackie Chan film. This movie is amazing!!! And the recreation of the fight scenes are just magical, thanks to master director Michael Mann.<BR>i'm very surpised of what a great actor will smith can be...it just about the roles!!..great acting all the way. Dante Spinoti gives once more an unforgetable cinematographic journey, wich is a tradition in almost all michael mann movies. over all the film is really entertaining. I'm a film student and a huge Michael Mann/Dante Spinoti fan and this film is a great oportunity to see this two masters work together. Class a film all the way. So if you really want to see a different american movie...try this and pay great attention to the visual that cinematic gennius spinoti brings on to this films. The sountrack, like in every Mann movie, is just espectacular!<BR>Don't pay attention to the others people reviews, they are just used to watch the typical every day movie. sorry for the spelling, i'm not from the U.S.A, but this doesn't mean that i don't know a great movie when i see one.
B00005JKED|2.0|I watched Training Day with high expectations, after Denzel Washington's Academy Award.  After watching this film, I can tell you that Denzel deserved his Oscar alright -- he just didn't earn it in this film.  Washington has demonstrated his extraordinary talent in everything from Glory to Philadelpha to The Hurricane, and it is a crime that he received his biggest accolade not for any of those three films, but for this overdone, unconvincing bit of celluloid. There's no question that Washington does quality work here, but leave it to the Academy to confuse an impressive turn in a contrary-to-type role with an Oscar-worthy performance.  (Seemed to be a theme this year, as Halle Berry's good-but-not-great performance in an ugly role took home an Oscar as well, when other of her performances were far more deserving.) In terms of quality, Ethan Hawke's performance as the morally conflicted rookie was far, far more impressive.<br />The real problem, however, is the film, which has its high points, including several high-tension moments between Alonzo and Jake, but devolves into a formulaic good-cop vs. bad-cop story with a totally anti-climactic &lt;I&gt;deus ex machina&lt;I&gt; ending.  Director Fuqua shows promise, but has some growing up to do.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Their best studio effort to date, Sigur Ros' album Agaetis Byrjun makes for a dreamy, haunting listening experience. Birgisson's falsetto vocals display incredible power, particularly for their high range. At times, he waxes throaty, but usually only during bridges in the sweeping, epic tracks. Many of the cuts weigh in at well over seven minutes, sometimes twelve. However, unlike some of the band's other recordings, none of Agaetis Byrjun's songs feel drawn out for the sake of pushing the limits of the listener's patience. Nearly every note feels as though it belongs.
B00003CXAT|4.0|I will not get into the technical aspects of the making of this movie other than to say it is stunning to watch.  This is what movies should be about... entertainment, fun, action, and a pleasure to watch.  When it was first released it was a stunning visual spectacular with all of the special effects of the time that audiences had not really experienced before.  The only complaint I have about the movie is how far it strayed from the book in some instances.  The switching of the 2 children's personalities (in the book the boy was the computer geek and the girl was the follower of dinosaur history) was minor in the scheme of things, but still bothered me somewhat the first time I saw the movie.  They left out the pteradactyl's in this film even though that was a big part of the book.  I am sure there were other things, also, that I cannot recall at this time, but still overall it was a fantastic movie.  I have not seen the DVD as of yet, but I have owned the VHS for a number of years and still enjoy watching it.  I really enjoy movies where I don't have to look for a hidden meaning and just enjoy the show.
6301763041|5.0|A rough little gem, courtesy of our resident sick vile genius, Mr. John Waters. This picture is a startlingly well-executed spoof on those dreadful Elvis movies which we love to hate. Johnny Depp has got the sneer and swagger down pat, and is backed up by a zany array of grotesque suburbanites lovable degenerates. The music is flat brilliant, as is the exuberantly over-the-top choreography (particularly Johnny Depp's in-prison numbers). The lineup of actors runs the gamut from Iggy Pop to Ricki Lake to Traci Lords to SLA darling Patricia Hearst! The dialogue and character development is toe-curling bad, as are fair-sized chunks of the cinematography. But then, Waters had to throw some of his trademarks into this otherwise sweet and practically squeaky clean film. Wrongfully rejected by many hardcore Waters-heads, Cry-Baby (like Hairspray) is a step into more conventional territory for the Baltimore auteur, but still has some of the outrageousness for the benefit of folks without the stomach for his trash masterpieces like Desperate Living or Pink Flamingos. So watch it already. If you don't find something in here you like, then you're too picky.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Animation's pinnacle.  The death of Mufasa is Bambi-esqe for many younger children, but the characters and story in this movie are profound, and the presentation is magnificent.
B00005AQE8|5.0|ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS IF U DONT HAVE IT THEN U SHOULD GO AND GET IT.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I've read Ludlum's books since he first published.  His plots are intricate with more layers than an onion.  Like Tom Clancey, his long and involved story lines do not lend themselves to a 120 minute film abbreviation.  The mini-series with Richard Chamberlin was fairly faithful to the book, this is like the Cliff Notes version, lacking both complexities and conherence of the book.  As a stand alone action movie with a passing nod to the original book, it's OK.  Matt Damon looks much too young for the seasoned spy, Jason Bourne, but he does a good job with what the script offers.  This is a good example of why so few of Ludlum's book became movies.  The film will be enjoyed far more by those who are not Ludlum fans. Don't expect the throw away toung-in-cheek wise cracks that make most action flicks fun.  This one takes itself seriously.
0767811070|5.0|I SEEN THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS GOOD. EVEN THOUGH HE WAS PLAYONG A BAD BOY IN THIS MOVIE I STILL LIKED IT. HE IS ONE GOOD ACTOR AND HE KNOWS WHAT HES DOING. IF U HAVENT SEEN IT THEN U SHOULD GO AND SEE IT.THE ONLY THING I HATED WAS HOW HIS FRIEND DIES AT THE END. THATS THE ONLKY THING I DONT LIKE.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Okay this is the best No Doubt album that I have ever heard, Gwen Stefani and co. created an album that is dance and pop and alturnative. The disk starts out with an intro from the title track Rock Steady, then moves into Hella Good which is just a great song in the first place, then comes Hey Baby, followed by Making Out which is one of the best tracks on the album, you have some more good songs until you get to the song that just shines on the album, Don't Let Me Down, at least that is so in my opinion. You have the single Underneath It All, which is a great song, then you have the new single Running which is the only really ballad on the album. It's just fantastic.
0151006903|4.0|First, you have to enjoy medieval setting and mind-set to enjoy this book. It is a playful romp through the stories, legends, and mythos that formed the mindset of 1200. The sense of wonder and mystery expressed by the characters is joyous. (Imagine spending an entire evening debateing the dimensions of Solomen's castle!) Plus it examines the making of history. Sometimes, is history only a matter of who tells the better sotries and lies? All in all, great fun even if you have to work at bit.
0345413377|5.0|this book is the best of the 3 part series, so good in fact was the whole series that I didn't want it to end!<BR>Get these 3 books, the golden compass, the subtle knife, and the amber spyglass and give them a chance, it's not something that you will regret.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|what can I say? the video &quot;all the things she said&quot; is just incredible. I bought the single and the album. I love t.A.T.u.. Yulia and Lena are just cute. all singles of the LP are fantastic, even the russian ones. The whole album is a kind of rock-alternative but there are also slow songs which are great.
0893860220|5.0|This book is written in question and answer format. Initially it may seem that the advice is a little vague.  However, with continued reading it is clear that this book contains one of the clearest descriptions of what the goal of &quot;enlightenment&quot; is; and a simple path by which to pursue this goal.  The advice is consistent with many other sources such as &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; and &quot;The Power of Now&quot;, but provides a perspective that allows one to begin to understand what it is like to live in this world, yet to really be beyond it. 100 stars would be more appropriate than 5.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B00005N9CV|5.0|i loved this cd alot. Diana Krall is in great form.
B00005BJR0|2.0|I'm one who has seen and own both versions of Blade Runner, unfortunately the original (or \\"Criterion's\\" version) is unavailable on DVD.  The movie as a whole is excellent for a film of 1982, its graphic imagery and imagination matches that of Lucas and the Star Wars Saga of the same time period.  It's visually stunning with more unveiling suspenseful drama than action, to keep you glued to the film.<BR>  <BR>       Where the film falls short however is in the \\"Director's\\" choice of presenting the film.  Alot of Harrison Ford character's thought dialog (found in the Criterion Collection) is axed from the film, in favor of the Director's cut.  This can leave the viewer, who has never seen the film, lost as to what is going on.  The thought dialogs add ALOT to the film, as to who the replicant's are, his knowledge of the replicant's history (when he picks up a set of photos, his thoughts ask \\"why... because replicants don't have families\\" for example.  Information that makes the direction of his search more understandable, \\"vital\\", and less confusing.), his thoughts to why he retired from the Blade Runner force, and more.  The Director's Cut is a real hack job to the original and makes the new script very weak.  I can only hope that the \\"Criterion\\" version may soon be released, as Blade Runner is an excellent film and NEEDS to maintain its original strong storyline.  To those who may be searching, the \\"Criterion\\" version may only be found on the large laser discs (as it's been phased out after the Director's Cut release).
B000062Y98|4.0|At first I thought this album was a five-star, easy.  It is simply stuffed with good things-good song writing for the most part, CRAZY talented musicians, but was the overbearing chamber orchestra in the background and constant choral vocals really neccessary?<BR>Long ago, Blind Guardian started out as just another german thrash metal band, with slightly better song writing than its peers and a lot of influence from science fiction other escapist literature.  They built up, improving musically, definitively breaking from thrash metal with the album Imaginations from the Other Side.  With Nightfall in Middle Earth, Blind Guardian achieved a class by themselves-everything was in place, the stars were aligned, the subject matter was perfect. <BR> A Night at the Opera is an example of a band crashing from its own inertia.  Again, the only people who genuinely HATED this album weren't genre fans.  They expanded their subject matter into  philosophy(The Age of False Innocence, about the emergence of Neitzchean thinking) twentieth century history (Wait for an Answer, which lamented the tragedy of the rise of the Third Reich in Germany) even venturing into religious themes with the opening track, Precious Jerusalem.  <BR>But the production is simply too much.  I liked the songs, hated the production.  I would love to hear these tracks stripped down and remixed without so much extra noise.  As it stands, Night at the Opera is a flawed heavy metal masterpiece.
B000002UAX|5.0|To sum up The White Album with one word is nearly impossible. You may choose \\"eclectic\\". Or perhaps \\"brilliant\\". The word I choose is \\"masterpiece\\". The White Album is my favorite Beatles album. Why? Because never before or since has an album been created with such a sprawling, diverse, fantastic collection of songs with mind-blowing lyrics and brilliant arrangement. I could get into how I feel about each song, but there are just too many. Instead, let me tell you which songs are the best. Some I like because they are beautiful. Others are great rockers. Some make you think. Some make you crank up the stereo and play air guitar. My personal favorites are as follows:<br />Back in the USSR<BR>Glass Onion<BR>Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da<BR>While My Guitar Gently Weeps<BR>Happiness is a Warm Gun<BR>I'm So Tired<BR>Blackbird<BR>Piggies<BR>Rocky Raccoon<BR>Julia<BR>Birthday<BR>Everybody's got something to hide...<BR>Helter Skelter<BR>Long, Long, Long<br />Do yourself a favor and get this album. Make your own decisions about which songs are the best.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd to be honest is to HEAVY for me.They have no rythm in some songs and its sounds sometimes horrible but the 1 song for 5 stars is WAIT AND BLEED without that they wouldint see the likes of me buying this.Wait and Bleed is one of the best songs with so much hate and anger yet it carries some melody.But i listen TO KORN there my favorite and without them i wouldint like SlipKnot.Over all Go By The Cd Now!
B00006AW2P|5.0|This is a fun collection of songs that inspired the Rolling Stones to begin playing music in the first place. Very enjoyable renditions from their R&B roots...
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush Of Blood To The Head is fantastic, the most beautiful album I have heard in a long time, original, poetic, haunting.  I can play it over and over and never get bored of it.  Coldplay performing live are amazing. Chris Martin is fantastic live and looks fantastic ! Green Eyes and The Scientist are my favs but I love every single track on this CD!  Clocks is just beautiful.  Love it all the way !
B00005JKED|5.0|When I saw this film at the theater, it disturbed me and as a result, I didn't think it was that good.  The disturbing part?  Well, the violence and the language!  But that is an integral part of the movie.<br />When the film later was on cable and I reluctantly watched it, and then watched it again, and again, and again.  I found myself mesmerized each time by the acting, in scene after scene.  Denzel and Nathan were very believable and compelling characters.  The scenes with just Nathan were the most riveting!<br />Though the ending is a canned, quick and furious wrap-up to the story, it is the acting that makes this a memorable piece of cinema.
0553801481|5.0|I love the Assassin series! I DON'T love the Liveship series. I see the ties between the two, but I do not agree that one has to have read the ship series to understand the Assassin books...probably because I didn't really understand the ship series! The Fool is such a mystery that I cannot seem to read fast enough to find out more. Poor Fitz, you have to love him. He seems so normal to me - he does dumb things, bad things happen to him...makes you want to jump in and help him. Robin Hobb's characters are so real - what an excellent writer!
B00006LLJ4|2.0|Meant to be a copy of The Matrix and similar &quot;sci fi&quot; movies, i guess.  To me, not much is dumber than a special effects movie in which the special effects are totally unconvincing -- like this.  Very little plot, just an intro used as an excuse for another chase movie.  Everything is blue, for some reason (another irritating affectation).  No daylight ever appears, everyone and everything is blue.  WHY?  also, the &quot;futuristic&quot; cars and street scenes look hokier than Star Trek of 1968.  Could not sit through it.
B000084T18|5.0|dis the hottest joint out right now definately pick it up if you know what good music is
B00000K0DQ|4.0|That this movie stars two of my absolute favorite actors (one of whom has yet to receive the Oscar he deserves) and that it touches on a subject that I have strong feeling about (against the death penalty) would have been enough to get me in the theater to see it.  But what could easily have been a preachy, two-dimensional movie that simply flogged it's message and put sermons in the mouths of the characters instead turned out to be a well-written, well-acted movie that doesn't stray from it's message but also doesn't make cardboard cut-outs of its characters or let them be overwhelmed by the subject matter and message.  This movie had to be as difficult to make as it was to watch.<br />Some will criticize the movie for not showing more of the victims of the character played by Sean Penn.  Of course, those same people will probably also object to the movie's anti-death penalty message.  The truth is that a movie about the victims could have been made - and could still be - but it would simply have been a different movie than the director, producers and others set out to make.<br />What gets glossed over in the criticism is that while this movie never apologizes for it's point of of view, it also never gives short shrift to the other side or attempts to demonize or paint the other side as two dimensional.  That Prejean earnestly reaches out to the families of the victims get's glossed over.  That the movie gives and honest portrayal of the pain and suffering of the victims' families gets glossed over.  That the movie does not downplay Poncelet's crime or guilt, but instead reveals them during the course of the story, gets glossed over.<br />\\"Dead Man Walking\\" takes few, if any, easy ways out.  The character's are all fully human in their portrayal, when it would have been easy to paint any of them as monsters or two-dimensional walking viewpoints. It would have been easy to portray Poncelet as a mere monster, instead of a flawed human being who is guilty of despicable acts, but who feels anger, love, fear and even remorse.  It would have been easy to portray his family as an evil bunch.  It would have been easy to portray the victims' families as bloodthirsty vengance seekers.  Instead, \\"Dead Man Walking\\" simply tells a troubling story that involves human beings, and that doesn't necessarily have a tidy ending.<br />This movie isn't likely to change any minds as far as capital punishment it concerned.  It won't be all the things it should be to all people.  It may simply serve as another means of starting the conversation about the subject, and simply getting people to ask themselves why they believe what they believe in regard to the death penalty.<br />Regardless, it's just a good movie.ble acts, but who feels anger, love, fear and even remorse.

B00005JKHP|4.0|I am a diehard Next Generation fan, and I recently decided to watch all of the Star Trek movies from the beginning in order.  So, Star Trek:  The Motion Picture was the first step.  So, if you are a newbie to the whole Trek genre, listen up!<br />Star Trek:  The Motion Picture is like an extended episode from the series.  The movie involves Kirk's return to the helm of the Enterprise in an effort to save the planet from a mysterious entity that has engulfed and apparently destroyed three Klingon cruisers and is now heading for Earth.  As admiral, he usurps the command of Capt. Decker (played by Stephen Collins, the father from tv's 7th Heaven) and recruits some of his old former shipmates, including Bones, Scotty, Uhura, and Zulu for the mission.  <br />The Enterprise's encounter with the entity (called &quot;V-ger&quot;) creates a stir as it abducts a crew member and sends back a clone as a probe.  Eventually, of course, the good guys win out, but the ending will leave some surprised, others going &quot;oh my god, that's so cheezy&quot;.  You will have to see it for yourself to find out what side you come out on.<br />All in all, not a bad movie.  Entertaining...great to see the old crew (including a younger, slimmer, trimmer William Shatner) get together for a decent adventure in space.  The plot is a bit campy, but nonetheless, very fun!  Recommended!
6303109950|5.0|This isn't what the ol' west was all about. This is what Hollywood films are all about: big casts, large conflict, and compelling characters. It's all set to the backdrop of Tombstone, a large town in the ol' west where Wyat Earp and his two brothers decide to retire to and make a small fortune in silver. Doc Holliday also lives there, winning card games like Mark Maguire makes home runs. But the outlaw gang the Cowboys are menacing the town and stirring up trouble. Reluctantly, the Earps and Holliday come out of retirement to fight back and defend their town. This is an extremely remarkable film with great acting, a thick plot, and some suspense-filled shoot-outs. It's a must-see for any movie buff. One of the best westerns also made.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A friend gave me this CD and since then I have recommended it to all of my friends and have given it for gifts. Nora's voice is soothing, sultry taking the listener to another place. Come Away With Me is well worth the money. I haven't gotten tired of any of the songs after a month. Go get it!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I caught the band's song &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; on the radio and was curious to hear more. These two teenages sing about love and issues that transcend age. Their slight russian lilt adds a exotic element to the songs and the strong beat makes it impossible to not move to. They do have softer ballads on this album for those that like slower music. The album also has two songs entirely in russian. Even in another language you can feel the emotions that these women are feeling. I have already gotten the majority of my friends to go buy this album, and am now trying to spread this great music to people I either barely know or do not know because it is so great.
0312932081|5.0|The premise: In humanity's first encounter with an alien race, all the humans were wiped out.  Since then, human society has been centered on producing military leaders capable of defeating the aliens in our next encounter.  Ender Wiggin is seen as the child who may have the capability of leading humans to victory.  The book chonicles his experiences in Battle School, where he and other kids train for the impending confrontation.  While this plot is the superstructure, it's the substructure of the book that makes it great: young kids bearing enormous responsibility, in a hyper-competititive environment, being used for purposes they do not entirely comprehend.  (SPOLIER WARNING: the next sentence contains information about the ending!)For anyone who's ever put everything they had into some goal or objective and been disasterously surprised by getting what they want, the ending of this book will resonate strongly.  I am not much of a science fiction fan, but this is a great book.
B00006RIO7|4.0|It's been a while since we've seen a musical hit the big screen and done so in an effective way without the usual Hollywood cut and paste versions.  \\"Chicago\\" is by far, the best adapation of a Broadway musical I've seen in a long time.  The soundtrack contains most of the original songs in the show, and the performances are top notch!  Catherine Zeta Jones' polished and sassy 'All That Jazz' is top notch! You can easily tell she's an accomplisehd and trained singer. Richard Gere, bless his heart, manages to pull off a couple of songs with ease, and Rene Zellweger's vocal talents shine through in many of the shows songs. The best surprise of the recording is the newest song 'I Move On', written for the film my Kander and Ebb.  I only wish that the song could have been incorporated into the movie, rather than played over the ending credits when everyone is leaving.  My only regrets about the soundtrack, is the two songs that are labled as 'music inspired by the movie'.  Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim and Macy Gray on an unnecessary, hip-hop, rap crap renedition of 'The Cell Block Tango' is an absolute insult to anyone who is a fan of 'Chicago' and its composers. Anastacias 'If Love Is  A Crime', has a nice beat, but, caters to the intellect of 16-18 year olds.  The song 'Class' is done well by Latifah and Zeta-Jones, and will be seen on the DVD when available.  If this is your first taste of \\"Chicago\\", you're in for a treat. If you're familiar with the original cast recording, or the 1996 revival, you'll appreciate the soundtracks faitfulness to the originals, and its parents, Kander and Ebb.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It has a solid story that is well written. And while your at it, if you like to argue the finer points of Quantum Theory in regards to time travel then this is an added bonus.<br />And what is a movie with out your friendly neighborhood Demon Bunny?
0375757813|4.0|Mansfield Park got better as I read on...<br />The characterizations are typical of Jane Austen: alive, distinct and vivid. Sir Thomas Bertram as Fanny Price's father is vindicated especially when compared to Mr. Price (Mansfield vs. Portsmouth is a part of this distinction). Mrs. Norris's treatment of Fanny is deplorable; her move to the morally banckrupt permanently cements her personality. Fanny herself is not my ideal heroine. Her timidity and repression could use a good dose of Elizabeth Bennet's wit and Emma Woodhouse's confidence. Then again, she would not be Fanny anymore. ..

B000079B0A|5.0|If \\"Light Years\\" was a comeback, then \\"Fever\\" cements sexy Kylie's status as the new Queen of pop! Kylie has already had countless hits under her belt in the UK and Australia, where frenzied fans of hers are aplenty. But with \\"Fever\\", she has even managed to crack the hostile American market. Everyone is already fimiliar with the smash singles \\"Can't Get you out of my head\\", \\"In your eyes\\", \\"Love at first sight\\" (this hidden gem is easily the best song of her career) and \\"Come into my world\\". But don't miss the other tracks, the whole album is replete with consistently catchy electro pop, dance and disco tunes. The amazing thing is how irresistable her brand of disposable pop is! <br />  The repackaged version includes remixes which equal or even better the original versions! \\"Can't get blue monday out of my head\\", \\"Love at first sight\\" (US Ruff and Jam Radio Edit) and the fantastically sexy Fisherspooner mix of \\"Come into my world\\" make this repackaged edition of \\"Fever\\" a must-get even for those who have purchased the original version earlier. <br /> This album will definitely satisfy old Kylie fans and bring her a whole legion of new ones. It's time for the wannabes (Britney Spears and co.) to step aside and let Kylie show you how its done!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Well, I've never reviewed anything on Amazon before but this CD is so amazing I felt compelled to say something.<BR>There's probably not much to add after 450 reviews but if you've only heard Audioslave via \\"Cochise\\", then you are really missing the big picture. Personally, I think \\"Cochise\\" is the weakest song on the CD. Maybe that's only because it's been played to death on the radio. Personal favorites include \\"Like a Stone\\" and \\"The Last Remaining Light\\"  \\"The Last Remaining Light\\" is a wonderfully trippy and atmospheric song.<BR>Enjoy.
6300183211|5.0|This is the best movie i have ever seen. Their is alot of violence and coarse language in this, but it just adds to the realism of the movie. It follows the life of Tony Montana as he comes over to America to go to straight to the top of the drug game. He is a man that gets so greedy and kurupt with power and still wants more. Quite a long movie but every second kept me interested. If you are into gangsta/crime movies you should of seen this 100 times by now.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Out of all the heavy metal cds I have, t.A.T.u.'s album seems a bit out of place in my collection. I love hearing their russian accents as they sing the songs in english. They do have other albums out, which all seem to be remixes. I thought the song &quot;How Soon is Now&quot; was a t.A.T.u. song, but it was originally done by The Smiths. I despise The Smiths, but the t.A.T.u. version of that song was wonderful. I simply can't get enough of Yulia's singing. It's just incredible! You owe it to yourself to buy this album. I got mine for seven bucks. = )

B00006RIO7|5.0|My wife and I went to see this movie on a Fri. night to a half filled theatre however everyone around us, before the movie started, had seen the movie several times---I can now see why, this musical has the best that hollywood can offer in music,dance,lighting,sound-- we plan on seeing it again,plus have ordered the CD soundtrack. Hollywood may be filled with liberals but they sure know their business!!!  Paul Peterson
B00005YXZH|1.0|I can understand why some albums can be highly regarded by the critics. For example, I understand the rave reviews Beck 'Sea Change' has garnished this year..the album may not be for everybody but you have to agree it deserves the credit that's been heaped on it. I can understand the critics going crazy over Radioheads 'O.K. Computer' and 'The Bends'. I can even understand the critics praise for the new Bruce Springsteen album (although for my taste he should have limited it to two or three songs at the most about 9/11). I've always thought of myself as someone who listens to music with open ears and an open mind, and it's definitely not for a lack of trying to like it. I listened to it many times over and really feel it's a case of the blind leading the blind into believing they should really like this.    This is considered a medicore album even by fans of Wilco. Which Journalist was responsible for overhyping this and who were the guilty parties who followed his or her lead? This album has three memorable moments..'Jesus, etc.', 'Kamera', and 'Reservations'. Otherwise, it's VERY forgettable. This is not a CD that even these critics who are praising it will remember in a couple years, let alone play it. Don't believe the hype.
B00008DDXB|5.0|Not only did my ten year old child enjoy this video, I did as well. Although if you are squeamish, it is not for you. This story has snakes,  and lots of them. I also enjoyed the flying car scene and the cute, little creature, who Harry gave his sock.<BR>If I was still a kid,I guarantee you I'd be kinda dissappointed cuz Hermoine was sick & not in on alot of the action. (i e... Back when I was a kid, I watched Batman, & became upset when Batgirl wasn't in on the action.)Other than that...this video rocks.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I really give this 4.9 stars, since I found one of the early action sequences to be a little less than perfect (you get spoiled seeing people like Jackie Chan and Jet Li in action movies), but the Matt Damon does a surprisingly good job with them, and his usual first-rate job of making the character come to life on the screen. <br />The plot is only related to the Ludlum novel -- the screenplay was morphed into a nicely claustrophobic character story about a small community of people up to no good, and the movie is cast to perfection with a wonderful collection of actors who deliver terrific performances. The director also directed &quot;Swingers&quot; and &quot;Go&quot;, and his indy-film background shows through in quite a few scenes where the tension is heightened by the use of handheld cameras and shooting in real locations without a crew.<br />Damon is just outstanding as an amnesiac with a growing sense of dread about himself and his abilities, and Franka Potente has the presence and intelligence to bring off the character of the girl that helps him at first for money, and then later out of a combination of curiosity, tenacity, and aimlessness (she really doesn't have anything better to do). Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles are wonderfully menacing and matter-of-fact as the villians.
0747553556|5.0|This is, by far, the best book that I have ever read. I am in fact a student of culinary arts, and have worked in restaurants since an early age. I believe that every person thinking of owning, working, or eating in resaurants should read this, and in fact live by it. I can't think of a better book that actually tells you what goes on behind those kitchen doors, and in the dark world that is the industry. <br />Tony Bourdain was afraid to say what was really going on and he should be applauded for that.<br />Read it and believe it
B00005JKGI|5.0|This movie made me go out and buy a MINI, I love this movie I bought it on Lazer disc years ago and have been waiting for this to come out on DVD, this movie is a blast from the past, it has some fantastic lines.

B000066NW0|5.0|I really like Avril's cd.  It had lyrics that spoke to me.  The songs (especially Sk8ter Boi) were ones that played over and over again in my head.  I'd recommend it to everyone.  As for Um, no...like you could sing any better.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Hi, I love this song so much. it is a wonderful song.
B00000JGOJ|4.0|The most accurate way I can think of to describe this widely ignored gem is that it's like a full season of a pretty decent television drama whittled down to two hours - and even that sounds far more pejorative than the compliment it's meant to be. The snappy dialogue and interactions are given life and dramatic weight by a universally solid cast (even the actors portraying characters in the weaker story lines are excellent) - that quality alone makes this movie most enjoyable, but the way the director and cinematographer manage to give the film's L.A. setting a truly lush, romantic polish also merits a viewing.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Well...I wasn't much of a beck fan...I just started listening to him lately...i got this album..coz I heard a few songs..and I though they were real good plus they'd got real good reviews by rolling stone and from my experience I've realized that the rs ratings are quite good..now I'm really hooked..Its his voice ,the lyrics..everything..The mood of this album is quite melqncholy...but its really good
B00003CXAY|1.0|The idea is great and there is a lot that could have been done with it. Many praise it because it looks so different -- and unique. But the result is essentially bad. Simply repetitive and boring from start to end. After a few minutes it is enough.<br />... many [individuals] do not rate reviews of \\"great works\\" on what is said, but on what they think it should be said. <BR>And that is the point of this review for the uninformed reader: read with an inquiring mind what the other guys and I myself say here.
B00005JLXC|5.0|With Daredevil, Marvel Comics has yet another spectacular film on their hands.  Credit must go to the writer/director Mark Steven Johnson for adapting the story so perfectly.  Ben Affleck surprises all his critics by giving the performance of a lifetime.  Jennifer Garner continues to dazzle and proves that she's a superb actress, an action heroine, and a beautiful star all rolled into one.  Colin Farrell breathes vibrant life into the psychotic super-assassin, Bullseye. Michael Clark Duncan introduces us to the ruthless Kingpin while John Favreau, Joe Pantoliano, and David Keith are superb in their supporting roles.  Can't wait for the sequels!
0698119347|5.0|This book is just like wacthing a James Bond movie! It's about a kid named Alex who works for MI6 and gets to go undercover. After you read this book the 2nd one even better and I mean that. If you like action you love this!!!
0316666343|2.0|Why is it on the NYT bestsellers' list i have no idea, other than a interesting concept of posthumous narrative, there's nothing more to the novel than gratuitous emtional fluff. I can't believe i bought this book. If you are into that kinda stuff, and have nothing better to do, maybe u can consider buying if from me.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Season 1 of Deep Space Nine lays the groundwork for the best Star Trek series ever produced.<br />DS9 is the \\"forgotten middle child\\" of the Trek series.  It always sat in the shadow of Next Generation and Voyager and was never hyped by Paramount.  yet, we see and feel the effects that started from DS9.  Mentioned numerous times in the movies (First Contact (Defiant makes an appearance), Insurrection (So'Na are collaborators with the Dominion), Nemesis (Remans were ground troops during Dominion War) and even in Voyager (B'Ellana losing her mind at the thought of all the Maquis aare dead, and \\"Prometheus\\" where teh EMH2 mentions to the Doctor that 'The Romulans have not joined in the war against the Dominion.)<br />DS9 was always the series to take risks.  Its moral plays are the best in Trek.  It even took the step of having the enemy destroy much of Starfleet headquarters in the 10-part Series finale!!<br />The writing, the amazing story arcs, the death of a major character, it's moral plays, the study of spirituality, the invasion of Federation space, the struggle for freedom, the amazing acting, the tremendous guest cast, (which included an Oscar winner), the political machinations, the \\"dark side\\" of the Federation, all combine to make one of the best Sci-Fi series of all time.<br />And yes... DS9 had the BEST space battles ever -- this includes the small screen and the big screen.  If you think Star Wars has great space battles, you haven't seen DS9.  Whether it be a couple hundred Klingon ships against the sole space station, or a couple thousand Cardassian/Dominion/Breen ships against the Federation/Klingon/Romulan fleet of a few thousand... it's just one sight to behold.... even on the small screen.<br />I can't wait for the DVD!!!
B00006J9OT|4.0|This live CD is extremely welcome in light of Diana's latest studio release, &quot;The Look of Love.&quot;  The live setting captures Ms. Krall at her best, when she is playing the piano and singing.  She is amazing at both.  Her phrasings on tunes such as &quot;I Love Being Here With You,&quot; or &quot;Maybe You'll Be There&quot; are especially nice.  Additionally, her rendition of &quot;A Case of You&quot; is a treat to say the least.  Her piano work there, along with the pure emotion from her singing is breath-taking.  So, you may ask, why four stars, and not five?  To put it simply, it comes down to a matter of personal preference.  Though this recording captures Krall at her best, she does not fully escape the orchestral arrangements found on her last two studio releases.  I just don't enjoy orchestral arrangements in jazz music.  I think they dull the soul of jazz (This is not to say that orchestral instruments are not useful in jazz, Regina Carter is an example of good jazz violin).  Therefore, I couldn't give this recording the full five stars.  Had it been without the orchestra, it probably would have gotten all five.  Let's not focus on the negative, though.  It is a great live performance from Krall, and is definitely worth buying.
B00005JLSC|1.0|The Brilliant, Innovative, Unforgettable Mr. BOB FOSSE showed us way, way back HOW it was done and HOW to do with \\"SWEET CHARITY\\", \\"CABARET\\", and the utterly sensational and unsurpassed \\"ALL THAT JAZZ\\". Mr. Fosse had and still has that unique ability to take your breath away with his superior and unique visionof the Art of Dance.<br />This movie is a pale shadow of \\"Cabaret\\" - good intentions but no originality - it's an extension of the \\"Take Off\\" number from Mr. Fosse's \\"All That Jazz\\" and possibly unintentional bits of Ken Russsell's magnificent \\"BOYFRIEND\\" [the Zeta Jones entrance ala Glenda Jackson - or better still la Streisand \\"FUNNY GIRL\\" - or legendary Joan Crawford's entrance in \\"Rain\\" - now there was Velma!] ~ [Also the Rolls Royce hood ornament transfer shot].<br />Oh, the bodies are just delicious - especially the ladies \\"She Cargo\\" and what is visible of the gent dancers - all very Fosse .... but IS this also Rob Marshall?<br />Performances ..... not bad - especially the beautiful Zeta Jones [Ava Gardner???], Renee Zellweger only carried limited expression [Madonna? Chalize Theron? Goldie Hawn?] - the original ladies were Leaner ..... and Meaner ...and the SERIOUSLY overlooked RICHARD GERE is an 'eye-opener' - what a snub from the Academy!<br />John C. Reilly? Much better in \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Hours\\" [really nom.worthy there].<br />Sorry, perhaps it's just me -a but that's it folks - pale, pale phantoms - along the lines of the archaic Tiller Girls or perhaps Sondheim's \\"Follies\\" [long overdue for the big screen].<br />Limited appeal....miss Bobbie's original vision though ....
B000067CPX|5.0|This is a great CD.  The Red Hot Chilli Peppers have yet created a delectable masterpiece.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|&quot;Persuasion&quot; is probably one of the most exceedingly brilliant Jane Austen screen adaptations to date. It is the story about a love that has known disappointment and is now quiet, cold and even a little bitter, but has never really died. <br />The fact that &quot;Persuasion&quot; was made on a relatively small budget does not take away from the film. The cinematography is simple and very matter-of-fact which does not outdo the various locations in which the film is set. The main and supporting cast work wonderfully with a magnificant script written by Roger Mitchell. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds as Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth share a certain chemistry that works terrifically for the emotionally charged scenes which have little to do with dialogue and more to do with stolen glances. Sophie Thompson gives a stand-out performance as Anne's sister, Mary Musgrove, a hypochondriac whom nobody can stand. Her lines flow flawlessly out of her mouth.<br />Overall I would give &quot;Persuasion&quot; five stars. It is a film that requires patience because you'll grow to care so much about Anne and Frederick that it will be hard to wait and see whether or not they come together as they are so obviously meant to. Unlike other Jane Austen screen adaptations such as Sense and Sensibility which is a &quot;louder&quot; and more passionate romp through the 1800's (and just as good), everything about Persuasion is very quiet and subtle. The movie relies on the character's silences and facial expressions which often contradict their actions and words, and in doing so have made, overall, a very satisfying love story.
B00004Y87O|5.0|This truely is a great movie,I suggest watching this over & over. To bad this DVD doesn't have the features it deserves hopefully it will soon ...Just found out S.E.EFNY DVD Slated for Dec.2003 release.

1577311523|5.0|I started reading the book a week ago and immediately felt more focused after the first chapter.  I have been reading about Zen Buddhism for about a year now, and while I found it enlightening, I have not read any other book that was as clearly stated.  I am a survivor of many abuses in my early years, and I found that I was constantly reliving these abuses and suffering the pain all over again.  Now, I have a handle on my thinking that was lacking.  I recommend this book to anyone who seriously wants to be at peace.  I think that anyone who is looking for power over others or material gain should not bother.  I also recommend that those who read this book and found that it changed them should read Thiaoouba Prophecy by Michel Desmarquet (sp.?)   <br />I read every review on this site and I feel so hopeful for the future of this planet that so many people understood and are passing the message on.  Perhaps there is hope for a better world in the near future.
B000021YQV|3.0|First of all, let me just say that I was extremely disappointed by this cd.  When I first heard Chop Suey!, I was very impressed by this song.  The istrumentals were amazing, ranging from interesting acoustic chord progressions to cool electric riffs.  In addition, the vocals were great, an unusual mix of great melodies and awe-inspiring vocal harmonies.  However, when prison song came on, all of that originality was nowhere to been found, and Serj resorted to a rap-whine similar to the annoying Fred Durst.  Granted, this comparison is not to be found anywhere else on the cd, but it was still annoying.  In addition, a lot of the songs consist of monotone yelling of repetitive phrases and mushy and nondistinct guitar parts.  However, Some of the songs were very cool, including toxicity, which has an extremely cool guitar part by Malakian.  Indeed, this band seems to alternate between ingenious and totally uninspired, often in the same song.  A case in point is the song Atwa.  I started out with a cool guitar part and harmonies between Malakian and Tankian.  But then the song changes to the dreaded pounding guitar part and monotone vocals.  I just don't get System of a Down.  You want to love them, but you just can't help but get annoyed by some of their stuff.  They certainly have a fresh sound, though, and it is evident that all the members are plenty capable.  Ultimately, I personally think that you can find better elsewhere.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first heard t.A.T.u I wasn't sure but after a few listens I was hooked! I brought the album 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane and I haven't stopped listening to it! It has lots of different styles on it and will appeal to a range of tastes, there is pop, dance, rock and some more melodic songs
0553801481|5.0|Robin Hobb is one of those rare writers who can create a universe that entangles the readers into believing every aspect of it.<br />We pick up Fitz's life 15 years or so after the end of the Farseer series and soon realize that Fitz (Tom Badgerlock) has no more control over his destiny than he did in the previous series.  Called by his innate sense of responsiblity to friends and family, and his overwhelming sense of duty to his country, Fitz again undertakes a perilous journey to save the Kingdom.<br />Unlike the first series though, Fitz embraces the little control that he has on events which surround him and draws strength from from that circumstance.  By recognizing he has little personal choice, he is able to accomplish what must be done.<br />Robin Hobb also brings in some more of the Mad Ship series into this seires, and I hope that a more complete explination of the Elderings (central to the Farseer and Mad Ship series) is in order.<br />I had two quibbles with this book, first it is too much of a recap of the previous series (the curse of the second series) and it seems to me that his adopted son is too young for 15 years to have gone by.
B000084T18|5.0|This album's a banger, I copped it on the day of release. Still in my CD Player a week later. 'Nuff said.
B000065AI3|4.0|You knew Tom Petty was going to stay true to rock and roll from the very beginning. While not as sophisticated as his later work; TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS gives the listener every indication that this band was in it for the long haul. When you hear the first few notes of &quot;Breakdown,&quot; you know there is a darkness here, along with the skill to grab a listener immediately. Sure there are two songs with &quot;rock&quot; in the title, (always a concern)and the band's sound is far from consistent, but you can't hide the energy. A fine debut recording for one of America's great bands.
B00005JLXC|5.0|What I said is true. This movie rocks! What really boosts the movie's quality (not video or audio, but overall viewing) is the music. The music boosts up the action and the action boosts up the movie. Everything is good about it. The only thing I didn't like was Colin Farrel's character for some reason his accent was terrible and just he was ick! But that was the only bad thing other than that the movie was great and the soundtrack is kick butt! There is alot of great action scenes as well as good cameo appearances by Stan Lee (man at crosswalk) and Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob director Kevin Smith (forensics dude at forensics lab, a really funny scene who he shares with the wonderful Joe Pantoliano of Memento fame). A good date movie and a good movie to see on a weekend!
0446677450|4.0|This book provides a great insight into a different way of thinking.  It gives you a basis for how to break the mold of just getting a job and working your whole life to retire at an old age.  It's not a how to book.  It will spark ideas that you can follow up on to generate wealth on your own.  Don't expect this book to tell you exactly what to do with your life.  Use it as a stepping-stone to your education.
0783225970|3.0|Scarface is an all-time classic, though certain aspects of the film appear a bit dated now.  For example, we see the Tony Montana character played by Al Pacino grow addicted to cocaine.  By today's standards, this may seem to be a belabored and trite plot device.  It is important to remember, however, that many of us harbored throughout the early to mid 70's the illusion that cocaine was not addictive, so to many who saw the movie in 1983, this was a new look at the cocaine underworld.  (Compare the Scarface treatment of cocaine trafficing with the more recently released Blow, where we know at the outset of the film more or less how it is going to end.)<br />Another aspect that seems a bit dated is the Hispanic gangster stereotype, as virtually all the film's Hispanic gangster characters (with the possible exception of Steven Bauer's Manny), seem somewhat one-dimensional.  (Compare Scarface's treatment with some of the Hispanic characters in the more recently released Traffic.  Traffic's treatment of Hispanic characters is more nuanced.)<br />These dated aspects, however, don't mean that Scarface is not a great film.  Given the changes the Tony Montana character must go through during the course of the film, as his single-minded quest for the American Dream unravels, I would rate this as one of Al Pacino's greatest performances.<br />The DVD special features are a great feature in the DVD version.<br />Five stars for the movie itself and the extras.<br />The DVD quality, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired.  The quality is grainy, and the film does not appear to have been digitally remastered.<br />1 star for the DVD quality.<br />This is a movie crying out for a new, remastered version, especially as it is currently out of print.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones does remind me of many who have come before her without sounding like any of them.  She interprets each style and genre with elan.  As beautiful as she is, could her voice be even more so?<br />I recommend this CD to anybody who enjoys being swept away and is looking for a aural escape.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I waited ten years to see ANYONE do this musical, on stage or screen, and I was not disappointed in the least.<br />After 199?'s gorgeous but unnoticed film version of Evita and the more recent, painfully abyssmal Moulin Rouge, CHICAGO finally hits home with audiences and critics alike, I will join those who pray this will bring back the movie-musical.<br />The plot can be read in the other reviews on this page, so I won't waste words here.  But the comparisons between courtroom theatrics and sleazy burlesque posed by this musical cannot be ignored.<br />The film is perfectly cast, and one can tell each member had an absolute blast in making the film.  And each is so SURPRISINGLY amazing in the songs, I had to check and see if the voices were dubbed by professional singers.  They weren't.<br />So, for an amazing time, go see CHICAGO.  After seeing Lord of the Rings again, of course. *laugh*<br />Oh, and for the record:  Bob Fosse was the choreographer/director of the original stage show.  The show was written by Kander and Ebb, who wrote Cabaret.
B00005B6C9|4.0|It is, amazingly, the first Bee Gees studio album that I have ever bought, so I did wonder at the start! I heard the title track performed on TV and went out and bought the CD - I wasn't even sure I liked the song. I am still convinced it is the weakest on the album.<br />Whatever! The version I have has two extra tracks and the tracks that follow the title track are all excellent and typify the singles - the singing by Barry, in particular, and the harmonies by all three are brilliant. You can understand what they are singing and the mix of song styles is another strength.<br />Favourite tracks are \\"Just In Case\\" and \\"Promise The Earth\\" (the two bonus tracks), \\"Wedding Day\\" and \\"The Man In The Middle\\", but it's difficult to pick out the best from a strong set.<br />The other reviewers have said it before - they continue to show the young pretenders how it should be done. I hope this great album is seen as an appropriately deserved epitaph for the sad and sudden death of Maurice.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Hey Everybody,<br />  I bought this CD and can't stop<br />listening to it, or watching it(it is enhanced).<br />You all should buy it, and check out  to read more see more and drool<br />over the lovely ladies of T.a.T.u.
B00007E8V4|5.0|What can I say? SoaD just keep getting better and better.This album is a must have to add to your collection.Good strong lyrics,very good guitar solos and the best drummer out of any band I've ever listened too.All these songs are great and with Serj's voice,how can you go wrong?<BR>Life,so unnecessary...
B00003CY6M|4.0|Serendipity may not be the greatest movie ever made in the film industry, but this is definitely a good movie to watch during weekend or whenever u feel like to have an easy relaxing time.<br />like many reviewers said, yes, the moive is sooo predictable that u know what's going to happen next and what the ending will be; the plot is also silly enough that you know what Cusack and Beckinsale did in the movie is called beyond-reality. however, i still found the movie is entertaining, funny and cute enough that i would love to watch it again, again and again.<br />if you are not into chickflicks, i can assure you this movie isnt tailor-made for you; if you believe you have broad movie tastes or are interested in chickflicks, Serendipity would be a perfect choice for your next movie selection.<br />My General opinion: this ISNT something you want include in your DVD/MOVIE collection (unless u are a fan of Cusack and Beckinsale or u absoultely LOVE the movie,) but this is a movie which u want to rent and give it a try. and by the way, both Cusack and Beckinsale did a good job in the movie.
B00006RCNW|5.0|So powerfull and real. I watched the whole series within one week. Hope the second season will be available on DVD soon. From hating this corrupt police guys to loving and wishing they won't get cut. I couldn't help it, but as long as they got the criminals, I didn't mind their corruption.<br />Get going Guys.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Following the success of both X-Men and Spiderman, Marvel brings us yet another succesful comic to film transition. Daredevil, while still maintaining a comic book feel is a much grittier film than both of the previous Marvel releases. In fact, I feel that this film is oriented more towards adult movie-goers than younger ones, although it should be a perfectly acceptable film for older children. <BR> THe casting in this film was superb. Ben Affleck was a perfect selection for the part of the Dardevil. As well, the gorgeous, Jennifer Garner, portrayed a very sexy and lethal Electra. The other supporting characters were also played well by their respective actors/ actresses. <BR> Overall, I give this film a 4. I also highly recommend it to any older fan of the comic hero or action junkies.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is truly fantastic work.  When I first listened to &quot;Warning Sign&quot; I almost cried.  The tones of the music, mixed with the pitch of Chris's voice and lyrics are terrific.  I've read that some people think the music is boring, but the point of buying the CD is that you're into this kind of music!  If you're a punk rocker, why would you buy this CD anyway?  The ONLY problem I have is that there are political statements in the 1st song and in the CD notes.  The other songs have to do with things that everyone can relate to, like emotions, break ups, missing an old girlfriend.  Those songs are the ones you can connect with.  Politics should not be touched, however - go to Fox News or CNN for that stuff.  If you want heartfelt, simple yet perfect lyrics and music, buy this CD!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is a hell of a lot of fun. It is filled with a great pumping rhythm and makes you bump to the beat! There is no folk music or sad sad problems drawn out in horrible harmony. This album may have it's angst ridden lyrics but it is just so much fun to dance to. Many of the songs are written like action movie scripts with lyrics like \\"Not gonna get us\\" and \\"Do we run? Should I hide? For the rest of my life?\\"<br />  I originally bought this CD after hearing \\"All the Things She Said\\" on the radio. Lo and behold this CD kicked my butt and then I got a look at the insert pictures. Hot, my friends. Definitly HOT. The music is awesome, the singers gorgeous. What more could you want?!?! I am definitly waiting impatiently for a new album!
B00003CX9E|5.0|\\"Citizen Kane\\" tells an old story, but what it has to say is as relevant as ever. Everyone knows the basics--Charles Foster Kane is a newspaper publisher who, after his death, is remembered by those close to him. (\\"Close\\" is really the wrong word, as Kane managed to alienate pretty much everyone he knew.) What becomes clear is that nobody really knew Kane; he kept himself removed from the world as he accumulated possessions. The reporters covering his death feel that, if they can identify the meaning of his last word, Rosebud, they will gain some insight into his mind. This is really only a plot device, though. Nothing can fully explain Kane, or any of us. <br />This movie has been so lauded for its technical achievement, the camera angles, etc., that it is easy to overlook the screenplay (by Herman Mankiewicz and Orson Welles) and, especially, the acting. That Welles, at 25, could have portrayed an elderly man so well is astounding. One wants to give credit to the makeup, but it's more than that. We feel that Welles has really lived all those bygone years. Of course the supporting cast members, most of whom had never acted in film, are also excellent. <br />Roger Ebert's commentary on the DVD is really outstanding, and particularly good at pointing out specific shots and camera tricks. There is also a track by Peter Bogdanavich. A documentary, \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\", explores the parallels among Welles, William Randolph Hearst, and the figure of Kane. It is quite well made, and they certainly got a lot of people to talk. But after seeing both Bogdanavich and Ebert explain that many parts of Kane were based not on Hearst, but on other figures, the documentary seems too intent on showing Kane to be an exact double for Hearst. <br />The reason for my title is that, when something has been called \\"the greatest film,\\" people want to approach it with an oppositional attitude. \\"Oh yeah? We'll just see about that!\\" It is better to simply expect a good movie. Notingits influence on later films increases one's admiration. But it is not necessary--\\"Citizen Kane\\" does just fine by itself.
0804106304|5.0|I knew this story was going to be amazing, since I saw part of the movie, but who knew it was going to be inspirational. I could relate to this book so much, it was scary. I could see my grandma's constant need to &quot;out-cook&quot; herself and friend. There was also my mother's need to brag about me and try to push me to be better. To GET that extra 3 points on the test. To BE number 1 in the class. I felt I wasn't alone with these feeling of never being good enough for my mom and not being asian enough. I just hope my mom doesn't think I'm ashamed of her, as many of the women felt in the story...
B00005JLSC|5.0|Oh wow. There are so many words I can use to describe this movie. It's amazing, it's funny, it's sexy, it's sparkling. The goal of this film, an adapted version of the classic Bob Fosse musical, is to, as one character puts it, \\"Give 'em the old Razzle Dazzle\\", in which it most definately meets and exceeds.<br />For those (Like me) who have never actually seen the musical, here's a quick plot synopsis. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger)is an aspiring and slightly ditzy singer, who is cheating on her husband. When her boyfriend tells her that he lied about knowing people in showbiz, Roxie shoots and kills him. So, after her sweet but dull-witted husband (John C. Reilly) rats on her, she goes off to prison, where she meets her idol, Velma Kelley (Catharine Zeta-Jones) once a famous vaudvillian, now hailed as a \\"femme fatale\\". Soon, Roxie too gains stardom with the help of Velma's lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and the ladies are duking it out for the attention of their public.<br />Everyone, from the lead role to the extras, act brilliantly. The song sequences are staged in a revue form, as parts of Roxie's obviously vivid imagination. The costumes and sets and music is all PHENOMENAL! From the first frame until the last, your attention is caught and hooked! This may not be a film of high morals, but you will eventually throw your first reservations to the wind as the story unfolds and that old Razzle Dazzle finally takes hold.
B0000025GW|5.0|I own a copy of every one of Dylan's records. You must listen to each one as a complete and individual work. Don't compare one to another. Most importantly, you must listen.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Despite the presence of an overbearing and over playing guitarist, namely A. Wilson, probably bent on making a name for himself (like his father, the great Gerald Wilson) at Diana's expenses on the recording, Diana never the less continues to shine! As an established artist myself, I realize the difficulty Ms. Krall faced in the production of this concert on both the performance and recording the audio and the subsequent DVD production memorializing the concert.<br />The caliber of musicianship is good and the guest artists on the recording(DeCosta and Pisano) obviously had the artistic maturity to complement Diana's unique skill sets, possibly due to the good fortune (and artistic maturity) they both had in working with the late great Joe Pass (guitar) who knew how to compliment great singers, most notably Ella Fitzgerald. Mr. Pass knew what the concept of artistic restraint meant when highlighting a unique talent!<br />Despite these difficulties, Diana does very well and has grown into the role she deserves.  Having never actually heard Diana Krall, some friends said she borrowed her vocal phrasing too heavily from an early Lou Rawls, but I must accept her talents as delivered on this recording as formidable.<br />The tune \\"Cry Me A River was edited out of the CD and included as an alternate take on the DVD, but might have been included as one of the best pieces on the date were it not for the \\"musical meandering\\" of Mr. Wilson throughout most of the piece.  I guess there are limits to digital editing on these live things!<br />Of special beauty on the CD is the solo piano rendition of the a Joni Michell tune which Diana should be proud to own as testament to her talents.<br />Among the thousands of CD's I have owned, borrowed (or made myself as a musician) this one would make the late Mr. Maher, original publisher of Downbeat Magazine go to a \\"six star rating system.\\"<br />We should come to expect more good recordings from Diana in the future.  Perhaps \\"the Georgia Peach\\" will return as the season's change and Diana can enjoy herself on these live recordings a bit more! She is indeed a \\"triple threat\\" and plays piano like Art Tatum with a \\"left hand from God\\", and a right hand from Bill Evans.<br />Well, people should buy the CD and enjoy it...I did and in deed I do!
0316666343|5.0|This well crafted novel about a murdered girl who watches the life she was once in go on without her is an amazingly intriguing and touching story, with passion, truth and the unimaginable.  Alice Sebold captures her reader's interest in this breath taking story that will give you goosebumps, make you laugh, and want to know more.  The ending is awesome, and unexpected.... This is a must read! Once you finish it, you will want to start it again, so pick up a copy of this book and read it NOW!!!
B000002U82|5.0|742 consecutive weeks on Billboard's Top 200 Album (CD) charts.  No other album or CD, not even Michael Jackson's Thriller has ever come close.  Do I need to say more?<br />Thirty years after it's release, Dark Side Of The Moon sells on average over 500 000 copies each year worldwide.  This album is timeless and a true classic in rock history.
B0000035GN|3.0|This is probably Lou Barlow's finest hour. I'm not familiar with any of his work with Folk Implosion but I would assume that this album surpasses it. Saying that this album is his masterpiece isn't necessarily saying a lot. Sebadoh were always trying to be the best band in the world but they never quite got there. They were constantly shy of being great. That being said this is still a really good record. Although, it is not an all-time classic by any means. &quot;Not a friend&quot; is an excellent song and probably one of Lou's best. The other songs aren't quite as excellent but there is some good tunage to be found. Highlights are: Magnet's Coil, Skull, Rebound, S. Soup, Together or Alone.
B000088E6M|5.0|Hey this albulm is pure lyrical greatness.  It's about time 50 got his breakthru albulm.  I started messin wit 50 like 5 years ago when he was working on the unreleased albulm \\"Power of the Doller\\" and that was banannas too! If you like hip hop you'll do everything in ur power to cop this albulm...and watch the dvd too..tite work!  Wit one disk he MURDERED blueprint: 2!!!  Gzzu Gzzu G-UNIT!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm not even sure where to begin...If you can appreciate a gifted vocalist, PLEASE get this CD. You'll love it. I've listened to the CD counless times and I haven't gotten sick of it and I'm sure I won't. Christina is able to express (or rather, slam) her emotions and experiences into her songs, creating passionate, powerful lyrics. Also, each track is unique; the songs don't all run together. Just buy this CD, you'll thank yourself. Its awesome.
0800177177|5.0|Ever since reading the purple prose and thin plotting of Bram Stoker's original book I had been looking for something that would give it the kicking it deserved. I found it in this movie. The undead monster is more human and more alive than the sadistic vampire-wannabe Van Helsing or the other feckless characters. And I mean that in a very good way.<br />It has strong connections to Fred Saberhagen's pointed and entertaining book \\"The Dracula Tape\\", which everyone who liked the film should go out and read.
B00006F7S4|3.0|I wanted to love this CD, but I just can't buy into the sad Beck. It seems insincere and overproduced. There are a few excellent songs, such as &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; and &quot;Sunday Sun,&quot; but not enough to recommend. Get it used.
0553573403|5.0|Jordan fell by the wayside for me 4 or 5 books back.  It astounds me that anyone still reads his books.  Tad Williams quickly and easily filled the void with Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn and his Otherland series.  Then I read the Song of Fire and Ice series based on reviews I read here and I was converted.  I can't top or add to anything already written about these books.  I highly recommend them for anyone who enjoys fantasy in the slightest.
B00005JLXC|5.0|totally different from what i was expecting. i thought it would be all sugar and happiness, like in spiderman, but the action sequences both surprised me and kept me on the edge of my seat. literally. i dont know how accurate it is based on the comic books, but i think it was worth seeing.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Quite possibly the most perfect album ever made.  That is all that can really be said.  Have been listening to it going on 12 years now and its still perfect.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Well, I can say, while I'm not a Prince follower, I'm still a big fan.  I Recently picked up the Rainbow Children album at my local Rasputin Music (In Northern Cali, the next best place to go, besides Circuit City.)and was amazed by what was passing thru my speakers.  It was trippy, entertaining, beautiful and had all the elements of any Prince CD minus the big time sexual content(which I do miss haha.)  If Prince had chosen to go with Clive Davis to J Records however, I'm sure it would be better.  2 geniuses can do wonders as you know.  But alas, it didn't happen.  Still this is a good album, and is a feast for the ear.
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in Time is a riveting 8 track album that should not be missed by any Maiden fan. The album is even better when you consider that it was written after their huge World Slavery Tour which took a lot of energy from the band. Nevertheless, it is still gold. This album invalidates anyone who says that all Maiden's music sounds the same. This is because they've added synth bass and synth guitar. It is very noticable in the first and title track, Caught Somewhere in Time. The multimedia video of the second song, Wasted Years, recaps all of Maiden's achievements up to point of Somewhere in Time. There are quick shots of their first major performance at the Rainbow when they had put out a mere 2 albums, and of the World Slavery Tour. The third song entitled Sea of Madness is a power-packed action-driven song with plenty of drum work by Nicko. The fourth track is the favorite at Maiden shows which represents Somewhere in Time. I speak, of course, of Heaven Can Wait. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner describes a runner in a cross country race. Stranger in a Strange Land (just the title) is inspired by the book of the same name. The multimedia video of that is live and it allows one to see the elaborate set of a Maiden concert. Deja Vu is my personal favorite for this album. Nicko puts in some great hi-hat work and it has a wonderfully sung chorus.<BR>Alexander the Great caps off the album. The lyrics write the tale of Alexander the Great and his fascinating life. One is reminded of the Egyptian theme from Maiden's previous studio album, Powerslave, with its Egyptian sounding tunes. All in all, Somewhere in Time is a profound and terrific album that is, in two words, \\"A Masterpiece\\".
0312305060|5.0|What an amazing book.  I bought this book a year ago and hadn't read it yet.  Anyway, I was going through some boxes of stuff early this morning and I found this book.  I knew that I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie in theatres so I started reading it around 10 this morning.  With breaks in between, I finished it around 5:30 this afternoon.  I've never NEVER read a book in one day, let alone in one weekend before.  This is the most clearly descriptive, deeply moving, interesting, and wonderfully written book I have ever read.  I CANNOT WAIT to watch the movie.  You should definitely read this.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Michael Chiklis may not have Clint's physical stature, but he's right up there with his no-hold's barred approach to law enforcement. This is a killer series, and you'll root for these Bad Boys to break the case, or some thug's heads in the process.<br />The first episode is worth the purchase, and I've never seen a more gritty. engrossing and compelling pilot in my life. Buy this DVD set and you will not be disappointed.
B00008DDXB|5.0|I cannot possibly say enough good things about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. This movie totally blew away the first one in every possible way, and is easily one of the top movies to have come out last year--only Antwone Fisher can touch it. The friendships were sweet how they always stuck up for one another, the Quidditch match was awesome to see, everyone involved gave wonderful performances, the final showdown between Harry and the Basilisk was just cool, and the scenes with Hagrid, Dumbledore, Dobby and Fawkes the Phoenix were sweet and touching as well. This film is a masterpiece with a mix of just about everything--some frightening, touching and humorous scenes all joined together. I loved this movie and am very happy I got a chance to see it. I just cannot wait to finally own it on VHS. Highly recommended indeed, and to anyone who thinks this movie stunk and that the book was better is free to their opinion, of course, but all I have to say is that after watching this magnificent film, I can't even possibly imagine how the book could be any greater. By the way, I've never read any of the books, just seen the two films, but now I'm not exactly sure if I want to read them anyway. Harry Potter films all the way!!!
B00005AQGJ|4.0|I could not disagree more with my man that said the songs on this album are \\"shoddy\\".   If you are a true 2pac fan then you will love this album.  It is more \\"street\\" than the others, but still has the catchy hooks like his songs that were liked by the masses.  \\"To live and die in LA\\", \\"Hail Mary\\", and \\"Me and my girlfriend\\" are the top songs on this album and are regarded as some of pac's best.  Buy this album,only, (yes only) if you are a true pac fan.
B000053ZRR|5.0|Excellent concert DVD!!!-especially if you have surround sound - I just love them.  They are like fine wine, they just keep getting better with age!!!They are still enjoying what they are doing and sharing it with all of us.  Great footage on DVD - and extra backstage tour interviews with the band.  Keep it up guys and thanks!!!
0871137380|5.0|Great job by a non-military guy, Mark Bowden. Blackhawk Down follows our good and noble volunteer armed forces putting their lives on the line in a hellhole called Mogadishu, Somalia. America was nobly trying to help starving people and weed out terrorist factions that were quietly and cunningly supplied by Saddam Hussein, the tyrant of Baghdad. I think every American should read Mark Bowden's Blackhawk Down, a true story of soldiers that tells you what they do. When I finished reading Blackhawk Down, I wanted to find out about our young men and women and why they become and remain soldiers. To understand why they do it, I went on to read Norman Thomas Remick's West Point: Character Leadership Education... which explains the philosophical foundations of what those young men and women feel, why they do it.
B00003OO3O|5.0|Ask any competent contemporary guitarist about Mr. Schenker and you'll probably hear analogies like 'god' or 'huge influence'. One of the best album covers of the mid seventies, even though it was kind of blurry.
0066214122|4.0|This is Michael Crichton style science fiction adventure at its best. I picked this book up Saturday morning and did not put it down until I finished reading it that evening. He combines well-researched ideas from nanotechnolgy, biotechnology, and computer technology with his vivid imagination and novelist license to create this fast paced story. Predator behavior emerges as swarms of agents evolve to form a network optimized to thrive and prey on their creators. The science behind this story is so well researched the book contains a three page long bibliography of scientific papers on artificial life, evolutionary design, self-organization in biological systems, competition and predation, and swarm intelligence.
0060934913|5.0|This has to be one of the most entertaining books I've read this year.  If you're looking for a witty and amusing book about the restaurant industry, there is no one better out there to read than Tony Bourdain.  If you're an Emeril junkie, a Food Channel addict, or are looking for the next food &quot;bible&quot;, look elsewhere, he will not appeal to you.  But, if you have a sense of humor and are not easily offended, pick up the book and be prepared to laugh out loud.  Happy reading!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|A supergroup for my generation! I know a lot of critics whine about how this band doesn't protest like RATM, but hey, this ain't RATM it's Audioslave! Anyway it's the music thats important--and this music is freakin' awesome. No one sings like Chris Cornell, a great musician in the vain of David Coverdale, Robert Plant and Rob Halford.  Like early Zeppelin this band is awesome and they know it! I'm so glad to have found a metal band so engaging. Heck, even the cover is great, done by the brilliant Storm Thurgeson (there always has to be a person on the cover).
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I really did like this cd.  Coming from the generation who grew up during the Beatles separate careers and John Lennons death, I love being able to introduce their music to my three boys.<br />I have always been a fan and now my sons join me in the celebration of their music.  From the generation born in the early 70's to my son's generation of the early 90's this a great collection of Beatle songs.
B000000W5L|5.0|The double LP Exile On Main Street is a very interesting entry in the Rolling Stones canon. A member of the uninitiated will wonder why this album is held as Mick and Keith's masterpiece--there's no big radio hits. No Sympathy For The Devil, no Satisfaction, no Gimme Shelter, no Jumping Jack Flash to be found here. The only two commercial successes from the album are Tumblin' Dice and Happy.<br />Exile On Main Street is not about the singles. It's all about the weary, dirty ambience. You could almost picture a red-eyed and exhausted Mick and Keith in a trashed bar with a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of Jack Daniels as they were writing and recording revamped blues songs. All the songs bleed together, and sound samey. Mick's singing is pushed back in the mix and the lyrics are near-indecipherable. However, the lousy production is what makes Exile On Main Street so memorable.<br />There's no denying that the songs are all grade-A material. The albums opens with three classics--Rocks Off, Rip This Joint, and the Bo Diddley rewrite Shake Your Hips. Then come Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Torn And Frayed, Loving Cup, Happy, Ventilator Blues, Let It Loose, All Down The Line, Stop Breaking Down, and finishes with the soul of Shine A Light and Soul Survivor.<br />Exile On Main Street is an acquired taste. It took me at least 10 listens straight through to really get into this album. Compared to the other entries in the canon, there are few mainstream concessions or attempts to be accessible. Even Mick couldn't understand what all the fuss over this album was about, and they rarely perform Exile material at concerts. Which is  too bad, because the fans both new and old are missing out on a real gem, albeit an unpolished and rough one.<br />If you're looking for the commercial singles, go buy the compilation Hot Rocks 1963-1971 or Beggar's Banquet through Sticky Fingers. I'd start with those first before getting into this one. The Stones would never make an album approching Exile On Main Street again.oching Exile On Main Street again.
B000000W6X|3.0|While the title track is alluring, the rest isn't as strong and  is more suited for background listening. Most songs hint several ideas using different vocalists but never really hit their mark.<br />The followup album Mezzanine is much stronger and I would recommend that you would seek out that one first.
B00000J7JO|3.0|Californication marked the return of John Fruciante to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After a long absence forced by his drug abuse. After the band released the subpar album and commercial flop One Hot Minute with Dave Navarro on guitar, Fruciante's return reenergized Kiedis, Flea, and Smith.<br /><br />I have to say, I felt for the longest time that Californication was the lowest point in the RHCP discography (excepting One Hot Minute). Aside from the title track, Otherside, Around The World, and Road Trippin', I couldn't find any real standout songs. Where'd the energy and funk of previous releases go?<br /><br />Then it hit me: These guys are in their forties. They shouldn't be expected to put out another Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Indeed, Californication is a continuation of the band's maturation process--Scar Tissue, Savior, and the title track both fully convey a sort of subdued, introspective view of the world that we only got glimpses of with the previous Under The Bridge. The funk is still there, it's just delivered in a different way (and for those who miss the raunch of the old RHCP, take a close look at the lyrics of Emit Remmus and Purple Stain).<br /><br />This is a fairly consistent release, dismissing the lame Get On Top which is a sub-B side that doesn't really fit at all with this album. The midtempo Easily, Emit Remmus, This Velvet Glove, and Parallel Universe are all quality tracks, and the lyrics are mostly good though not high art by any means (\\"Let's get it on with the alligator haters\\"...huh?).<br /><br />Californication is a strong album released from an older and wiser band, but it's not exactly ideal for those who are new to the band. Try Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, so you'll understand how they got here from there.
B000063NPX|5.0|Once in a while, a movie comes along that captures everything moviemaking is about: enthralling stories, beautiful characters and a aura about it that makes throughly unforgettable.  &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is one of those movies.  Based on the European folktale, the movie revolves around Belle, a beautiful but with a suttle eccentricity to her society of the day.  A village where the same thing happens everyday.  But when her father, a struggling inventor, goes missing on a trip to an invention festival, she goes looking for him, and finds him being held prisoner in an ominous castle.  No humans inhabit the dark abode, but those that were once human.  Objects like candlesticks and clocks are living, inhabited by the men and women that once lived in the castle.  Long before Belle found their home, a wandering witch disguised as an old beggar women  asked the master of the castle for shelter from the bitter winter, but he turned her away.  The witch then turned the master into a terrifying beast, and every man, woman and child into everyday objects, until the Master learns to soften his heart and learn to love, and have that person he proclaims love to love him in return.  If the Beast finds that person, the spell on the castle would be lifted.  If not, all those in the caslte are doomed to and eternity as objects and the master is forever a Beast.  Everyone in the castle hopes that Belle is the one to lift the spell.<br />The movie not only delivers the best in the fundamentals of movies, but features stunning animation by being one of the first animated movies to utilize computers with traditional animation.  The ballroom scenes are utterly breathtaking, as is the balconies and buttresses of castles exterior.  And the vocal performances are flawless.  Paige O'Hara is as subtle as her Belle, and Jerry Orbach is surprisingly witty as the fast-talking candlestick Lumiere.  And for Disney villians, the obsessive Gaston is one of the more human, and more compelling.  Not to mention the songs are a delight.  You can't stop singing &quot;Be our Guest&quot; can you?  Go ahead, sing the first verse while you watch one of the best movies (not just animated) ever
B00005CDNF|5.0|This album was released when Abba's future was uncertain. They might have been just another one hit wonder. Waterloo had been a worldwide smash hit, but the other singles from that album flopped. Depending on your viewpoint, this album demonstrates Abba's versatility (if you like it) or it is a mixed bag (if you don't). I love it.<br />The original album (the first eleven tracks) yielded three singles that met with varying degrees of success. I do I do I do I do I do was a big hit in Australia and a number one in New Zealand but a modest hit in Britain. It eventually went top 20 in America. S.O.S. was much more successful in Britain, where it was a top ten hit. It went top 20 in America, where it was the first single taken off the album.<br />Mamma Mia, on the other hand, was a number one hit in Britain and gave Abba a direction to go in for their next album, which would be Arrival. It wasn't very successful in America, where it was only a minor hit. Abba were never able to achieve consistent success in America, perhaps because they rarely visited. They were kept busy elsewhere.<br />Of course, those songs can be found on various Abba compilations, so it is the other tracks that are the reason to buy this now. Tropical loveland and I've been waiting for you are lovely ballads. Rock me and Hey hey Helen veer almost into glam-rock territory. Intermezzo No. 1 is an instrumental that sounds like Benny and Bjorn were trying to write a classical piece - I wonder what it would sound like if played by a philharmonic orchestra. Contrast that with the medley of traditional folk songs - one of two bonus tracks listed here. Apparently this medley was recorded for charity. As far as I know, this is the only time that Abba covered anybody else's songs.<br />So, this is a very varied selection of songs. My version of the CD has a further five bonus tracks, but these can all be found on either the Ring ring or Waterloo albums. This particular album has been re-issued several times on CD, originally with no bonus tracks, then with the five added, then with those five plus Crazy world and the medley, but now with those last two but not the other five. Since anybody who buys this album is likely to buy the two earlier albums anyway, the current track listing with just two bonus tracks makes the most sense.on CD, originally with no bonus tracks, then with the five added, then with those five plus Crazy world and the medley, but now with those last two but not the other five.

BUT, I love jazz music and after hearing some of the snippets and chicagosoundtrack.com, I THOUGHT the album was gonna be great.  Hate the talking during the tracks.  and the music could have had more energy.  If you like jazz, don't get this album.  It's sugar coated by the movie and the actors. <br />I wish I got Craig David's new album instead.

6304539282|5.0|In the year 1977, director George Lucas laucnhed his brand new film throughout the world, unknown to him that it would soon become a classic. It was called \\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\\", and it brought the start of die-hard fans, and it soon, sequals were created. It's \\"Star Wars\\", one of the greatest films ever made!<br />A long time ago, in a galaxy, far, far away, the Jedi Knights are an extinct race of saviors. Now, the Evil Galactic Empire and its Emperor are in control of the universe, and with their ultimate space station, the Death Star, they are invinsible. But with a band of heroes, a band of rebels and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) discover the the station's layout, but they were attacked by Darth Vader, an evil Jedi and the servent of the Emperor.<br />To protect the layout plans, Leia has the droids R2-D2 and C-3P0 carry them to the desert planet Tattoine, where they can deliver it to an old friend of the Republic, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who can give it to the other rebels. But they were captured by creatures called Jawas, and sold to a man named Lars and his nephew, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil), whose past is unknown to him. But when R2 runs away to deliver the message, Luke and 3P0 chase him into the desert, where they are attacked by Sand People. Fortunately, they bump into Obi Wan \\"Old Ben\\" Kenobi, who reveals to Luke that he is the son of a Jedi Knight.<br />And that's where the adventure begins. With Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and a wookie named Chubacca (spelling?), they begin the journey to save the universe from the Emperor, while Luke begins his own journey to become a Jedi, as well as to redeem Darth Vader, who happens to be his own father, Anakin Skywalker!<br />With memmorable lines, good storyline, and a cast of characters, this one is a classic - the work of a true genius (well, he once was). \\"Star Wars\\" belongs in the selves of movie fans, and it will forever be. Though the special effects are plain, the acting is great, far superior to ittwo (please let there be an improvement on the third) prequals, the acting is great. Like I said before, this is a classic!<br />P.S. This concerns the original.
0823003035|5.0|This book is loaded with information that goes beyond just drawing the human figure. As a trained Medical Illustrator I have had the unique priveldge of dissecting the human body and studying its contents and movements for over thirty years.  I have yet to come across a collection of thoughts and instructions as complete as those contained between the covers of this book.  Mr Ryder has a way of breaking down the approach to drawing the human figure that keeps the construction of the whole, or the parts, together at all times.  <br />The book is sectioned into three areas of awareness, the Block-In, the Contour aand Drawing on the Inside. Each section builds on the other. The drawing examples are very well presented. I have found myself reading pages two and three times in order to make sure that I fully comprehend what is being described.  Repeated reading has nothing to do with the way the material is presented; I just want to make sure I comprehend every word of what he is presenting.  What he has to say is very important and worth taking the time to read.<br />I then actually put the techniques to work in my sketch book.  The results are outstanding.  Throughout my career I have wondered off into areas of artistic adventures that have altered my focal point as an artist.  I have discovered that there are missing links in my training.  Mr Ryders approach has helped restore that focus.   I strongly feel that this book should on the shelf of any artist interested in drawing the figure or portraits.  <br />As with any book, the words are only as good as the reader is willing to put them to use.  Mr Ryder has done a wonderful job of organizing his thoughts and feelings about drawing the human figure.  You will not be disappointed in adding this book to your collection.
0312305060|4.0|The Hours is a novel about three women whose lives share a common thread. That thread is the novel Mrs. Dalloway. One women is Virginia Woolf, the author of Mrs. Dalloway. Her story seems very loosely based (with much literary license) on the facts of Virginia Woolf's life. Then there is Clarissa Vaughan, a modern version of Mrs. Dalloway, who is nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by a friend of hers at a young age. Like the Woolf character of Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa Vaughan is also preparing to give a party. The third woman is Mrs. Brown, who is coping with her life as best she can, as she reads the novel, Mrs. Dalloway in her spare and stolen moments. This is a story that seems to dance between these three women, with the novel as the dance partner they all share at different moments. I read this two years ago and totally disliked it. This time I read Mrs. Dalloway first (although I feel that a novel should preferably stand on it's own feet)to try to gain an understanding of the style and meaning of this connecting link. I really gained a new appreciation for this novel and the gentle intertwining of the lives of these three women that Michael Cunningham has crafted in the intricate style of Virginia Woolf's writings. The delicate link between these women is more than just depression and a novel named Mrs. Dalloway. This is a novel crafted of intricate layers that, in the final chapters, gently unwrap themselves to reveal the real person that intimately joins these three women together.
0790729644|5.0|Unforgiven is clearly among the top westerns ever made.  This movie is simple, dark and yet highly complex in its superb script and the outstanding performances by all concerned.  Few westerns will draw you into the lead characters as this one does.  Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and the sorely missed Richard Harris all deserved awards for their collective performances.  What is a western without Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman!<br />The premise:<br />Welcome to Big Whiskey Wyoming, where in a small \\"billiards\\" saloon, a cowboy gets angry at a whore and, with the help of his buddy, cuts her face up.  The other \\"women\\" of the establishment, pool their money and start telling everybody that they're offering a reward to whoever kills these two young cowboys.  This is precipitated by Gene Hackmans character Little Bill, who essentially doesn't punish them for their crime.  <br />Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, who in his earlier days was every bit one of the worst, meanest gunslingers in the west.  Some ten years prior to the events at the beginning of this fine film, William Munny met his wife Claudia, who turned this serious gunslinger into a family man, unfortunately for him and his little children, his wife died three years prior.  He is now a poor pig farmer, with two little children.<br />The son of one of his old riding buddies has heard about this reward and seeks out William Munnys assistance in tracking down these unpunished criminals.  After some hesitation, he seeks out his friend Ned, played by Morgan Freeman, one of the finest actors of our day.  The three of them head north to seek out the reward.<br />What follows is clearly a movie that while, for the better part is melodramatic; it is that melodrama that is gripping.  All those who received accolades for this fine film, richly deserved those accolades.<br />This exceptional film that graced the silver screen so beautifully and then the home theater, deserves a hallowed place on onesDVD rack and is perfectly well suited to repeated viewings.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all, even those who may not find themselves interested in westerns will find this film highly compelling.  {ssintrepid}

B00005JKZT|5.0|this movie filled my expectations and then some.  my man legolas kicked some major orc [behind], gimli was hillarious and aragorn was as serious as in the first movie with just a little more ferocity added in.  the sequences with frodo, sam and gollum were well shot.  lastly treebeard and the rest of the ents were some serious competitors for sauruman at orthanc.  overall the movie was great, the soundtrack was great(everyone loves that uplifting title song) and the cg was state of the art.  ...
B000088E6D|1.0|Unfortunately, the politics of the industry avoid the real talent. This album is produced well, but that's because David Foster is who he is. The tracks sound all the same, and no song has power or range.
B00002E224|1.0|I know someone who loves this movie but I have never heard of it. Neither has any person I know or any person in the whole town knows of this movie. Can this movie be really that good? She paid a one day shipping fee for this art film. I read the reviews and it sounded like it was very complicated and boring. Rated R !!???? Are you kidding me. Little children can't even watch this movie. Anyways, when I watch this movie. Maybe I will have a different opinion.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Amazing. Brilliant. Incredible. The most beautifully powerful lyrics I have heard in years: \\"tell me how you've never felt...\\" on \\"Show Me Love,\\" for example.  Driving beats, floating melodies, empirical declarations of defiant youth, love, despair, and frustation within the mindset of a suicidal world. <br />This is the first album in years that has actually forced me to sit still and listen to it over and over and over again. I can't stop. Groundbreaking, socially relevant emo hardcore lesbian neopunk synthpop.<br />The true credit for all of this, though, obviously goes to the producers, who have crafted a sonic masterwork around their vocal proteges. Personally, I could do without the endless promotion and the pimping of the \\"lesbian catholic school girl\\" image, but the actual music more than speaks for itself. <br />Thank you, thank you, thank you. I want more.
B00007BH5C|5.0|The tide has come in for Howard Shore, with his compositions for the Lord of the Rings movies. He began composing in August of 2002, and reprised his efforts from The Fellowship. The music fits perfectly for each sequence, from the mournful sounds of Gollum's Song, to the triumphant strains of Forth Eorlingas. Shore's theme for Rohan is so fitting to the medieval air that the Rings movies carry.<br />Here's my brief commentary on highlights from the CD.<br />Foundations in Stone begins as the movie begins: An air journey over the snowy mountains, and then a plunge into them to find Gandalf in the midst of his cataclysmic confrontation with the Balrog. In the first movie, we left Gandalf and fled with the Fellowship. In this movie, we plummet with him as he battles midair with the Balrog. The choir that we heard in track 13 of the first soundtrack comes back to provide the same &quot;ancient powers&quot; sound; desperate strains of fittingly cataclysmic-sounding voices. An absolute wonder. Indeed, this track could be considered the grandiose sequel to Fellowship's Track 13.<br />Track 4 is rather ghoulish, and should only be played if you wish to relive the moment when Frodo is pulled down into the marsh, or if you want to play theme music for Halloween. It's not a tune worth re-listening to, but brilliant in that Shore can convey such horror in his music as is shown in the movie.<br />Track 5 is the next really good one: We join Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as the trek across the plains of Middle-Earth in pursuit of the band of Uruk-hai and their kidnapped hobbit-friends. The magnificent tune of the Fellowship is reprised.<br />Track 6 finds the three Fellowship members joined up with the newly-returned Gandalf the White, and the four trek to Rohan to meet with King Théoden. We hear the theme for Rohan played on a violin-like instrument (Hardinger), and then an intense moment when Gandalf casts out a spirit of weakness from Théoden, and then glory as Théoden risesanew from his throne.<br />Track 12 finds our magnificent four along with warriors from Rohan battling Warg-riders, and then arriving at the stronghold of Helm's Deep.<br />Track 15 conveys the sound of preparing for battle, and then hope un-looked for comes in the form of a large troop of Elves. The music is a welcome variation on the mournful tune from Lothlorién ; almost a military march tune. Great stuff.<br />Track 16 is by far the best of the CD: The warriors of Helm's Deep make a valiant last stand, and look up to see Gandalf the White ride to their rescue with Eomer Roosevelt and his Rough Riders of Rohan in tow. This track is stacked with music from the cleansing of Isengard as well. The track opens with a choir building up to the majestic ride forth from Rohan and ensuing battle. Then a glorious rendition of the Rohan theme as Gandalf arrives, and then it all turns dreamlike as the tide of the battle is turned. I get chills just thinking about it. Simply the best track in the CD.<br />Track 18 is just a nice tune, as the hobbits overcome some of their dangers and continue on in their trek to Mordor and the fiery Mount Doom. It turns sour as we find Gollum plotting to lead our hobbit heroes into a trap, and warms into track 19, Gollum's Song.<br />Track 19 is a sad theme for Gollum. The singer supposedly has a pretty voice, but in the song it is rather sad and raspy. But then, appropriate for Gollum. It climaxes in a majestic brass version of the Theme for Rohan. Excellent ending to the movie and the regular soundtrack.<br />Wonderful music, all told. Worth buying, especially since it helps to relive movie moments.
B000002MFN|5.0|Hello...<br />Madonna got it erotica music right with this cd...<br />My fave 2 tracks are &quot;Erotica&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;... Both different but very good...  I also absolutely love &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; and &quot;Bad Girl&quot; is a fun song.  &quot;Rain&quot; is a beautiful melancholic song that chills me out...<br />Again, if you're a Madonna fan you'll love it...  <br />...peace...
B0000640VO|5.0|This is one of the most unique films I have ever seen.  It is simply a beautiful piece of cinema.  By the end of the movie, you feel such a connection with the character, Amelie, and you wish her nothing but happiness and love.  This movie is everything I look for--amusing, quirky, and original.
B000006045|5.0|Hello...<br />This cd is absolutely brilliant... My fave track is &quot;Teardrop&quot; with &quot;Intertia Creeps&quot; right behind it... I bought it immediately after I heard a dj friend spin &quot;Teardrop&quot; to close out a barefoot dance I attend on occasion... Not one cent was wasted - every track is worth it's weight in chocolate...
B00006RCPM|4.0|Those who choose to give up their freedom to gain security often find that having done so, they have sacrificed the former in vain not to gain the latter.  The dark world of MINORITY REPORT explores this theme in both visuals and in a vision of justice that leaves the term bereft of the meaning with which we usually associate it.  Director Steven Spielberg abandons the sense of wonder that usually accompanies his epics.  In JURASSIC PARK and ET, Spielberg allows his inner child to present a vision of humanity that allows his cast to face danger knowing full well that the danger has a wonder indelibly etched within.  In MINORITY REPORT, however, he harkens back to one of his earliest efforts in DUEL to show how one man can be beset by a sneaky violence totally beyond his power to control or to predict. <br />Tom Cruise, as policeman John Anderton, is a composite of many roles that he has done over a long career.  He is dedicated, action-oriented, smart--and flawed.  When his child is kidnapped and killed, he takes to drugs to forget the pain and guilt that he carries for allowing it to happen.  Immediately after his son's death, a scientist discovers a way to use human precognitive abilities to spot a murder before it happens, thus allowing policemen like him to arrest them, but before the crime actually occurs.  This police state power of course comes into conflict with the ACLU, who in one all too brief scene, argues that it is simply wrong to do that.  During the course of his investigation, Cruise as Anderton, comes too close to the hidden flaw in the entire setup--that the ability of the precogs is not as infallible as trumpeted, and he is set up as one who plans his own murder and thus must be apprehended by his own men.<br />Now there is nothing inherently wrong with taking the basic premise from the story by Philip K. Dick, but Spielberg, in his attempts to imbue his film with a gloominess not present in the story presents a movie that is at once a darkly spectacular treat for the eyes if not a test for the patience of a viewer who soon enough recognizes the oldest of tricks in a detective thriller: the placing of false clues and even more false clues to keep the viewer involved.  As I watched, I tended to overlook the grimness of the photography. Much of the film seems to have been shot with a filter that screened out any color brighter than light tan.  The spectacular car scenes that show Anderton plunging from one vertically placed vehicle to another while at supersonic speeds are a sight to behold.  Then there is the acting of both Cruise and Max von Sydow as the police chief, both of whom bounce off each other at all the right moments.  There is a father-son subtext between them that gives their relationship a resonance not seen since Dustin Hoffman had his molars examined by Sir Lawrence Olivier in MARATHAN MAN.  MINORITY REPORT is the sort of fine science fiction film that thrills the first time one sees it, but I suspect that its witheringly dark grubby underside will prevent one from wishing repeated viewings.

B000051VWW|4.0|Stuart Mathewman is the lead guitarist and the musical genious and writer of the music behind Sade. Sade Adu is the writer and vocalist and also writes some music for the band, Got it? After nearly being on Hiatus for approximatley 8 years (since 1993) and given the title &quot;Queen of mellow !&quot; After she took a long break ..in 1994, bands like &quot;Portishead and Tricky&quot; emerged giving birth to what we call Trip Hop! Which was just a trippier version of what Sade delivered on her &quot;1992 Love Deluxe lp.&quot; 8 years later (2000) Sade finally returned with a unexpected style that was more accoustic and reggie based. Surprising the industry, a style that many don't know of in Reggie called &quot;Lover's Rock&quot;. Everyone in the industry expected her to follow the path of this new style that evolved from there previous music, but they passed it on to Santessa there Protege. Illustrating they can keep up with there successors without doing it predictably for there own lp. Some will argue that Massive Attack spawed Trip Hop? Well that is entirely true, but Sade spawned the jazzy, mellow and Female vocal sensiblity of it! Massive's style was simply weird and the vocals ranged from eclectic Male Vocals to Reggie Vocals and all of it wasn't downtempo in the beginning. Santessa is the album I think Sade would have made if she had freedom and didn't have to worry about commercial sales. <br />&quot;Lover's Rock&quot; is a great album but not the path or progression I would have choosen for her. I think Sade ultimatley knew what everyone expected of her and the band and ultimatley did something different. This cd is more bare in sound and goes against everything Trip Hop Stands for. &quot;If you are looking for the more Sade classic sound &quot;Everything But the Girl's-&quot;Walking Wounded&quot; lp is a product of Sade's evolution. Also definitley go and check for Santessa's (Delirium) which is written and produced by Stuart Mathewman and Sade! It is definitley the album that I think she wanted to give the public but was affraid of lack of commercial success! &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; is a beautiful effort but shows no maturity or growth for the group. Nor does it musically creates the complexity that you would expect after almost a decade of being gone! Lyrically the album lives up to Sade's traditional material. There may be a while before we can see what is next from this band so in the mean time check for Santessa a innovative works from the band!<br />Arish
B00005BJWO|4.0|I would buy it for Jackal but because i am not that psycho kind of guy and didn't like 12 monkeys so much i can't really say which one is better! 12 Monkeys is a psychological film that needs some thinking in order to enjoy it and the jackal is an excellent action film that doesn't need further comments. I would like to add that both Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis cooperate really well in the film and that the jackal gets sick sometimes in the film because of too much blood. Despite that i think they are both films worth watching them and nice to spend your time with!
B000002H33|5.0|I cannot say enough about this album.  It is the greatest composition by Metallica and in the whole metal genre.  You like solos? How bout 4 of them?  Not on the whole album, in one song: Welcome Home (Sanitarium).  Orion is the most beautiful rock song I have ever heard.  The intro of Battery starts out the album beautifully.  Master of Puppets has over 9 different musical themes and 4 changes in tempo.  Disposable Heroes has a solo that &quot;never ends&quot;.  Damage Inc. has an incredible bass intro with heavy, loud riffs played 1000 miles an hour. In short, Metallica=pure musicians.  This is my favorite album of all time and I listen to it weekly.  This album got me into metal.  BUY IT!
B000071ZZI|4.0|Damon is very dynamic as Jason Bourne. Fantastic and unexpectedly dynamic as never before, Damon along with his German girl give a terrific show especially in the action sequences. Franka Potente is excellent. It is a genuine, satisfying spy story that can make you feel pleased after watching it. Well directed and with good cast as both bad and good guys are great. The sound is also carefully designed and gives you the impression that you are followed too. It may be not so close to the book but...it is better! So don't care and enjoy! <BR> A little note that should made, for whoever didn't understand it, is that in the ending scene, the island where Damon finds his German beauty is the Greek island Mykonos!!!  Have Fun!
B00007E8O5|5.0|Cantrell's degradation trip is pure musical genius. If you are complaining about the crappy music your are being forced to listen to on the radio and on MTV pick up the degredation trip double cd. It is the best 25 bucks i have spend in a long time. You get your money's worth the first time you listen to it. The song 31/32 is the best thing to come along since Alice in chains unplugged. The single cd is still great but if you really want to get the full Cantrell experience pick up the double cd. you will not be dissapionted if you have any musical taste whatsoever.
0446310786|5.0|What can I say? The most powerful, influential, beautifully-written piece of literature of ALL time... that's saying a lot. To Kill a Mockingbird teaches us about the depths of human nature--prejudice, courage, fear, joys, hopes... Lee's use of projecting these ideas through the medium of childhood innocence and questioning works so well.. it's artfully and masterfully done in such a poignant, yet effective way. This novel will definitely move you and leave you speechless. Harper Lee is a genious of a writer. <br />EVERYONE, and I mean EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING, should have a chance to read this book sometime in their lives. It crosses all cultures, race, and creed. It's not just a read--it's an EXPERIENCE.
0671798154|5.0|Why did it take me so long to find this author?  Five Past Midnight is another great World War II novel, that zooms in at a fast pace, on a central hero in the American Rangers.  He receives support for his mission from several other unexpected and atypical heroes.  As a student of history, particularly military history, I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  I learned more about Nazi Germany, at the same time that I raced along with the main hero on his mission.  I felt like I was there with him all the way, and glad that I was not the one doing the mission.  James Bond has nothing on CPT Jack Cray, but unlike Bond, Cray has the personal problems that go with his type of work.  In my mind, this makes Cray more like the real heroes we see in the American military all the time.  Being an Army Reservist, I admit to a prejudice in favor of people who serve their country, even if I did start as a draftee.<br />This was the first Thayer book that I read, in paperback, and I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought in hardback, so I can reread it for years to come.  I now have 11 more Thayer books to look forward to reading.  Find his books fast, before everyone else discovers how good Thayer is, because his older books will start to disappear when they do.
B00005JLXC|5.0|For us who are \\"Daredevil\\" enthusiasts, I am sure there will be much debate as to the films re-telling of Daredevil's orgins.  Regardless, in essence, this movie stays pretty true to the Daredevil mythos.  Johnson's movie explores Matt Murdock's (Daredevil) tortured soul as he fights for the oppressed by day as the lawyer Murdock, and at night by Hell Kitchen's savior, Daredevil.<br />Johnson's strength is that he jumbles most of the major Daredevil characters (Kingpin, Electra, Foggy, Urich, and Bullseye) without loosing sight of the central character - Daredevil.  The Batman movies missed this important step in developing the four Warner Movies.  Johnson does this masterfully, as he brings the comic book to life.<br />Secondly, Johnson could have taken the easy way out, and not bring up Matt's religious struggel between being a good Catholic and living in the realities of this world.  Johnson handles this well by interweeving Matt's faith and struggel without being preachy. He struck a great balance.<br />All the actors pull their parts off and Afflect, who has the hardest part in selling Daredevil, does a good job.  Especially well acted is Michael Clarke Duncan portraying the Kingpin.  Further, Foggey is played perfectly.<br />The action/fight scences are also very well done.  Johnson's familarity with the martial arts shows and it is another superhero movie that excells in this area (the fights are far superior to the Batman, X-Men, Spawn,and Spiderman movies, only Blade rivals the movie in this area).<br />Daredevil has always been my second favoriate hero  (Batman is first), but this movie is superior to the Batman films as the plot and charcters are handled extremely well.  See DAREDEVIL the Movie, even if you are not a comic book fan, this movie is downright entertaining.
B000068OCS|5.0|After I unwrapped this DVD, I re-played it constantly throughout the day.  This is the most addictive DVD I've ever owned.  The whole point of this film is to take things that form the background of modern life (landscapes, industry, technology, transportation, etc.) and bring them squarely into the foreground.  The musical score contributes heavily to this process.  The opening sequence, which switches from Anasazi pictographs to an ultra-slow-motion closeup view of a Saturn-V liftoff, has an almost religious feel to it.  Koyaanisqatsi was made over a period of about 6 years and was released in 1983.  Many aspects of this film have been imitated in movies, television, and advertising since then.  However, few people have actually seen this masterpiece, and it was nearly impossible to get ahold of prior to this recent DVD release.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Despite the low rating I gave this album, I am not a Britney Spears hater. I'm just stating my opinion about this album, and I think it could have been a whole lot better. One thing I'd like to mention first is that everyone knows there are a lot of Britney haters, and for this album a lot of people (parents, mostly) are saying that she's not being as good a role model as she was on her previous albums because of the subject matter and what not. Well, people, you can't be a teenybopper forever. People DO have to grow up. That's why there are things called birthdays.<br />So why do I think this album isn't that great? Well, a lot of the songs on here don't really go anywhere, especially \\"Bombastic Love\\"; and \\"Cinderella\\" is a metaphor gone wrong. In fact, if it were up to me, I'd take \\"Overprotected\\", \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" and maybe even \\"Boys\\" and call it a day.<br />Also, most of the songs on this album have Britney going to the club and trying to get shy guys to dance up on her. And when you get past that, you'll find filler like the unnecessary remake of Joan Jett's \\"I Love Rock `N' Roll\\" and \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" (sorry, I never liked that song).<br />I understand Britney has matured, but I don't know about the material she has on this record. Let's hope album four comes out better.
0385484518|5.0|Mitch Albom was living the high life as one of the top sports columnists in the nation. He traveled, met famous athletes most people only dream about and was in demand. On the outside, he seemed to have the perfect life. But on the inside, he was struggling with it all and wondering if there was something more.<br />One day he sees a news clip of a professor, Morrie Schwartz, that he had during his time at Brandeis. Despite their close relationship, the two had lost touch and Mitch is saddened to discover that his lively teacher is now in the final months of his life. As a result, Mitch seeks to salvage the friendship that has been lost for decades and in doing so gains more than he could have ever hoped for. <br />For fourteen Tuesdays, Mitch flies hundreds of miles to talk to Morrie. Only, they don't just make small talk and catch up. <br />They discuss things that some people never talk about their entire lives. Death, culture, marriage, forgiveness. No topic is off limits and Morrie spouts wisdom about every subject Mitch mentions. <br />Morrie's teaching methods are somewhat unconventional as well. He teaches with love and acceptance, with openness and humor. Even on the most trying of days, when his disease is robbing him of his life, Morrie greets the day with open arms and true contentment, ready to share his wisdom with the world. <br />Tuesdays with Morrie is an unusual story that almost everyone can relate to. Through wit and humor, Morrie manages to instill in Mitch and the book's readers the true purpose of life, while unselfishly allowing readers to witness his final days. <br />Similar to Ishmael, this enlightening book has changed several lives for the better. Morrie's thoughts are not profound, however, they are often forgotten in the world today, making Tuesdays with Morrie a pleasant reminder.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|T.a.t.u's album &quot;200km/h in the wrong lane&quot; is a perfect style for all ages as it has very mixed styles from song to song. There is a cover version of &quot;How soon is now?&quot; which was originally released by The Smiths. I think they have done that song great justice! I particularly like track number 1 on the album as it resembles the sound of &quot;prodigy&quot; and if that was the sound they were aiming for they have done a great job!  With the style of music in the album it is proving to be a success for Julia and Lena and with three weeks at number one in the UK chart under their belt it is bound to go even further!
0783225857|5.0|This movie was shown to my 10th grade english class upon the completion of our \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" novel unit (that goes without saying, really). Most of my class didn't enjoy the film, but me being the old movie lover that I am, I instantly fell in love with the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has read the book, or who is looking to read the book. The movie did leave out several important parts of the book, but nonetheless, it is a great American classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and the DVD special features are great!
B00005JKJA|2.0|This movie reminds me of the famous \\"last-season-was-all-a-dream\\" Dallas episode.  Who wants to invest 2 hours in a movie only to find that all of the plot strands never DO connect and the excuse is, well, the whole movie was a dream and that's why nothing makes sense?  A lot of other reviewers purported to like this, and I don't want to impugn their honesty, but to me it's just another case of \\"the emperor has no clothes.\\"<br />I give it 2 stars because the pieces were interesting for about half the movie.  Oh, another \\"minus\\" -- the spanish language version of \\"crying\\" was ENDLESS>
0446677450|1.0|This book is the most repetitive, meandering scribble I have ever read. If you have the philosophy to invest your money in something that gives you a return, then you don't need this book. This is not a how-to book.
0064471837|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It combines magic and technology to create a new world that is in some ways completely alien and in some ways frighteningly like our own. The book is centered around a girl named Sabriel, who is the heir to the post Abhorsen-a post whose job is, in essence, to keep dead folks dead and not let them kill living folks. With a set of 7 mystical bells and the help of the sarcastic, mysterious Mogget, Sabriel sets out to rescue her father and defeat the evil Kerrigor. A novel that will literally keep you spellbound through the last page and leave you hungering for more. I recommend this to anyone who has ever picked up a book. A word to the wise: Read Lirael after you finish this, and don't be put off by the length (700 pages)-it goes by very fast.
B000002JPA|5.0|It goes without saying that this album is great. If you're a Dream Theater fan you're probably familiar with most of the songs, and you KNOW Metropolis and Pull me Under. These are very good songs, and deserve the recognition they get. However, I just read a review saying that besides Metropolis, Learning to Live, Pull me Under, and Take the Time, the album is full of filler.. (He gave the album 5 stars, i'm not trying to attack him) but that's simply not true. Under a Glass Moon remains one of my favorites, with a really cool chorus with heavy riffs and mystical keyboard in the background, and then a KILLER guitar solo by Petrucci that is one of his best. Another Day is beautiful, a nice slow song by Dream Theater, (They have plenty of great ones), and Surrounded and Wait for Sleep are both solid. I don't have When Dream and Day Unite, but I have everything else, and Dream Theater has never let me down yet. 5 Stars to the best band in the world.
B0000028M7|5.0|The is the most raw, hardcore, uncompromising, honest, twisted album i've ever heard...people don't say things like this out loud, in their head, maybe, but on an album...if you are on drugs, you won't be after this album...this album is out of control, it's straight from hell...hold on tight, your ears could bleed...personal favorite - \\"Junkhead\\" - ...\\"What's my drug of choice? Well, what have you got? I don't go broke and i do it a lottttt....\\"......oh my god, can you say stuff like this...thanks Layne, you gave everything to us, R.I.P., you deserve it, man....
B00007LL7O|5.0|I enjoy artistic albums and this CD could not get any more artistic. It is wonderful and very addictive. Once you listen to it once, you'll want to listen to it again. I was expecting it to be something like Infinite, but it's not and it is definatley origanal. If you have never heard Stratovarius, then it would be fine to start here. If you are a Stratovarius fan, I reccomend this CD. I also have a very flexable taste in music, so opinions my differ from mine. But this is just what I personally thought of this CD.
B00006M183|4.0|Although I do like &quot;I am mine&quot; and &quot;Green Disease&quot;...&quot;Thumbing my way&quot; is very personal and touching...why even explain in words when someone pours himself out to the public...it's a sacrifice, it's brave...and i give thanks...
B00007G207|5.0|Even if you're not one to enjoy foreign films, make a point of seeing this one.  This movie is truly a modern classic.  It slowly endears itself to you, and the ending is beautiful -- leaves you with a lump in your throat that you just can't shake.  <br />Also noteworthy is the score, which is easily one of the best filmscores of all times.  There's no way you CAN'T like this music -- pick up the CD and I guarantee it will become one of the permanent CDs in your 5-disc player.
0553269631|5.0|I first remember reading this book in high school and ever since then, it has become one of my favorite books.  Perhaps it Was because I was in high school -- a most vulnerable and lonely time for some teenagers -- that this book moved me.<BR>Carson McCullers writes about the lonely lives in a small southern town.  Whether through an awkward girl, a drunk, a sexually confused man, or a deaf mute, Ms. McCullers manages to convey the loneliness and beauty of these characters.  I have never read a book that spoke so distinctly about those feelings we always feel, but can never put into words.  This, along with the Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger, Tell Me that You Love Me, Junie Moon by Majorie Kellog, and McCullers' Member of the Wedding, is one of those rare books that speaks to the human condition, that puts into words all those strange feelings you could never quite articulate.  A truly beautiful, sensitive, and poetic book.  Read it!
0884271153|1.0|It's not luck is another novel about Mr. Rogo and his career. Where the first novel (the Goal) introduced a number of concepts relating to manufacturing, this one tries to convince us that the nowadays VP of a group magically discovers the definition and use of Marketing halfway through the book (who promotes a guy to a VP position without the guy knowing at least the basics about marketing?). Another revelation he magically puts on us is that Knowledge Managament is a very important concept, as well as the revelation that the book value of a company is different from the real value. Sigh, this is taught in every MBA course in existence (at least it should be). Furthermore, we should believe that the main character who is obviously severely brain-damaged (together with his apple-pie family), yet manages to become CEO of a large conglomerate? The author is hailed like a genius that has discovered so much truths... like the resource based-view of the firm (even though he doesn't understand that this is what he has discovered).<br />If you do find this believable, I have some dotcom stocks to sell you, I promise that they will soon rebound...<br />The Goal is worth reading, but this book is a waste of paper and money, buy something else, like a Barbara Cartland novel.
B00005JLXC|2.0|We have seen it all before. I gave this movie a second star because some of the effects were cool, but the organization and character development get zero stars.  I found it difficult to care about the main characters.  The back-story is dumped into the beginning of the film like a frozen bit in a hamburger.  I feel there was a great story hidden somewhere in this mess, but it just didn't make it to the screen.
0767822617|4.0|This film, starring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, helped propel Redford to superstardom. While Barbra Streisand was already a superstar, with the release of both The Sting and The Way We Were in 1973, Robert Redford's future in the film industry was assured.<br /><br />In this film, revolving around the class of 1937, Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) is a strident, political activist who is way to the left. Working her way through college, Katie is not the most popular figure on campus, but rather, the butt of jokes, often at her expense. She is a young, working class, Jewish woman with an edge and a bit of a chip on her shoulder. Humorless and dour, with her wild fro of hair, she is an individualist who is dedicated to causes that she feels will make the world a better place. She does not hesitate to speak her mind. This stance often finds her on the outside looking in. Barbra Streisand is really just playing the same role that she played in all her early films with an added passion that resonates throughout the film. At times, however, I found her performance grating.<br /><br />Hubbell Gardner (Robert Redford), on the other hand, is the quintessential Wasp, living the American dream. Blessed with All-American, golden boy good looks, charm, and grace, burnished by privilege, Hubbell is a poster boy for the old guard. He is a living icon for Wasp values. He is more than the sum of his parts, however, as he is also an aspiring writer with a way with words. While Katie, undeniably, has a crush on him, she despises his world. Hubbell, ever the gentleman, sees a spark in Katie that somehow draws him to her. Yet, while in college they are never more than passing acquaintances.<br /><br />Years later, they meet up again. This time, Katie has since improved her appearance, and Hubbell has written his first book. Katie is still sweet on Hubbell, and her energy, intensity, and zest for life attract him. The title song of this film adds to its bittersweet quality and went on to win an Academy Award in 1973 for Best Song.\\" Sung by Ms. Streisand, it became a chart topping  hit.went on to win an Academy Award in 1973 for Best Song.\\" Sung by Ms. Streisand, it became a chart topping  hit.
B000084T18|5.0|I have anxiously awaited the release of 50 cent's new album ever since hearing the track &quot;Places to Go&quot; on the 8 mile soundtrack, and after hearing the album for the first time, I feel that he will be a force to be rekoned with.  The album displays so many different tracks with different beats that he should be nominated for a Grammy next year.  This is the best album I have heard in a long time, and probably will be for a while.
0446677450|3.0|Robert Kiyosaki's premise that people should build tangible assets and spend less and more wisely is very good, but some of his stated facts are wrong and makes the book lose some credibility. For one, he mentions that the corporate tax rate is less than the personal tax rate, but that fact applies only to incomes less than $; most folks/corporation earn considerably more than $...  Also Robert says airline pilots have over 100,000 hours of flight experience; that number for senior captains is closer to 25,000 hours. A few other facts were very iffy from my experience in financial dealings which taints all of his statistics in my view. If the book can convince some of the younger generation to start building real assets and spend wisely, then the book will be of great service.
B00005JLRR|2.0|AVERAGe in every department: plot, acting, special effects. YOu'll get absolutey nothing more than average quality to this picture.<br />It's not bad, but I forgot about it as soon as I walked out from the theater, contrary to other films in the series.
0316666343|3.0|I don't quite understand what the hype is about.  The story moved too slowly for me.  There was a lot of description and detail - a lot of which I felt unnecessary - that slowed the story down.  This is a contemplative book, not a page-turner.  More time is spent on long descriptions than on the events of the story.  Also, there is no sense of justice for Susie's murder.  Mr. Harvey's ultimate fate seems hallow and empty and the murder is never solved.  The family never gets a real sense of closure, but just kind of falls to pieces ...  Not a depressing book, but far from satisfying, either.
6304981635|4.0|Considered by some critics to be the definitive martial-arts film, Bruce Lee's \\"Enter the Dragon\\" (1973) is comic-book escapism on a grand scale. Robert Clouse received credit as director, but there's no doubt that Lee handled the terrific action sequences. The fights are almost nonstop as Lee performs impossible feats with lightning-fast, effortless precision.  Though unoriginal in terms of scripting, \\"Enter the Dragon\\" represents Lee's finest 90 minutes on screen while featuring some of the best martial-arts choreography captured on film. It remains a spectacular swan song to his brief career. (For the Warner Home Video \\"special edition,\\" two scenes were restored that provide insight into Lee's character and his motivation for tracking down the villainous Han. Despite good intentions, the additional scenes are ruined by horrendous dubbing. Hopefully, Warner will reissue \\"Enter the Dragon\\" in its original version.)
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this CD and the first time I listened to it, I almost fell asleep.  Not because it was boring, but because it was soothing and relaxing; not loud and obnoxious.  This would be a great gift for even a 10 year old.  My daughter loves it(she's 12).  BUY THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!!!
B000084T18|5.0|SInce 2000 when we heared a smart mouth rapper spit about how his gona rob the rap industry's elite, we been waiting on this guy 50 cent album.. with the florish amount of street albums he put out and when he got signed to shady/aftermaqth everyone went nutts.. yo this album is not a classic but its the best out now and its exactly what u expect from 50.. really grimmy thuged out street lyrics.. My fav cut is between HEAT and U like my style. Whats best on this album is the production of Dr. Dre(4 kuts the most since xzibits Restless) RocWilder, eminem, D12's Kon Artist(denaun Porter) Megeherts, Digga and a few up and coming producers the albums beats get 5 mics, the lyric content 4.5.. Sorry but G units llyd bands and tony yayo dont really spit on this album as we are used to hearing the tre-o but its not needed becuz the G unit album is on deck.. this is the best album out dont waste time tryin to find it at the ,malls people there gone.. 50 made his albuims thru the bootlegs and i say its about time to see a officail 50 album.. 3 bonus cut that we all know the super played out wanksta , the classic your not like me and ur lifes on the line help to add to the flava, i say he should have put thicker then water, bad news and cross my path instead but ohh well.. yo the albums hot cop it and get that Nas God's Son now thats a classic..<BR>1
B00007BH5C|5.0|... The LOTR trilogy is thought as one single gigantic 9-hour movie. So, to achieve this, some parts of the musical score HAVE to reoccur, like the theme of the One Ring, the fellowship theme or the Isengard/Uruk-hai theme. <BR>Above all, there's quite alot new stuff on this album, like Rohan's theme or the Ents' theme and you have also to consider that this Soundtrack gives us only half of the movies' score.<br />It's simply one of the most beautiful and haunting scores I've ever heard. The most stunning tracks are Foundations Of Stone, Forth Eorlingas! and Isengard Unleashed, mainly because of their amazing choral pieces.
B0000025C0|5.0|Everyone wants to compare this album to the all-time legendary debut by this classic band.  I will be the first to agree that it isn't quite as good, but the truth is that this album overall stands up in quality.  The sonic, produced sound is very much in place.  The only drop-off in quality is with the last two songs, &quot;Used To Bad News&quot; and &quot;Don't Be Afraid&quot;.  I would bet that when Tom Schultz talks about having to rush this album out due to record company pressure, he is refering to those two songs.  They are still very good tracks--just not the absolute best by Boston standards.<br />The album is still overall an absolute classic.  The leadoff title track is absolutely one of their best songs ever, with perfect guitar playing and Brad Delp at his legendary vocal best.  &quot;Feelin' Satisfied&quot; is another impossibly melodic rocker.  &quot;A Man I'll Never Be&quot; is an epic power ballad.  &quot;Party&quot; is another fun rocker.  The production is still flawless on this album.<br />In summary, this album does not deserved to be maligned and compared unfavorably to the first one.  The people who obsessively do that must be the same ones who have that &quot;flavor of the week&quot; corporate pop music mentality that has contributed to popular music's demise over the past decade-plus.  This album has been, is, and always will be a melodic and classic rock masterpiece.
B00006G8O1|4.0|This was an enjoyable view, nearly wrapped up neatly at the end.  Similar to Night Schylaman's more popular film, 'Sixth Sense', it explores Time Theories in a unique fashion.  <BR>Donnie Darko is a teen with 'mental problems', (actually, likely more a product of the attempted 'cures'), who begins to see a man dressed in a rabbit suit with a human skull mask for a head.  The rabbit sends him off on adventures of vaguely then increasing destructive behavior.  The first and most destructive mission was a trip to sleep at the golf course where the rabbit informs him that the world would end in less than a month, on Oct. 31th.  While he was gone, a jet engine falls through the roof into his bedroom, thus his absence saves his life.<BR>Donnie becomes interested in Time Travel, partially through the rabbit's goadings, and begins to 'see' people's paths as they walk through space and time. <BR>This film was a good watch, and well executed given the difficult subject.  Highly recommended for Sci-Fi fans.
B000002O51|5.0|Okay, we all know that it took 8 years from the previous release for this album to come out, a trend that has continued with each release by this legendary band since then.  What should not be missed, however, is that this album is every bit as good as &quot;Don't Look Back&quot;, if not better.  It is a melodic rock masterpiece.<br />Starting off an album with a ballad is not always the best idea on a rock album, but it works here very well with the classic &quot;Amanda&quot;.  The song is a pretty, heartfelt love song that went to # 1 and caused the album to do the same.  The rock comes soon enough with track 2, the top 10 &quot;We're Ready&quot;.  A great track that is often overlooked.  Even better is &quot;Cool the Engines&quot;, with a sonic rock sound that rivals anything on the first two albums.<br />The best track of all, in my opinion, is the gorgeous anthem &quot;Can'tcha Say&quot; with its touching message and amazing vocal/guitar combination.  This was a top 20 hit that should have been a # 1--both rocking and ballad-like at the same time.  A fantastic track.  &quot;I Think I Like It and the closing &quot;Hollyann&quot; are other melodic highlights, while to me the only weakness is &quot;My Destination&quot; due to it being ridiculously similar to &quot;Amanda&quot;.  It is still a nice song, though.<br />This album admitedly does not rock quite as much as the first two Boston albums, but it does still rock in spots and absolutely stands up in quality.  It amazes me that rock stations don't play anything off this album and haven't for years now.  For sure, it is a classic album that belongs in any classic and melodic rock fan's collection.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Miramax's Chicago in definateltly the best movie of the year.  winning golden globes and being nominated for 13 academy awards doesnt look too bad on its resumer either.  Set in the 1920's, the adaptation of bob Fosse's musical is a sure fire entertainer, and anyone who doesn't enjoy it has bad taste in movies. Roxy Hart (Zellweger) is a woman who is destined to be on the stage,  but is always turned down.  Velma Kelley (Zeta-Jones) is a preformer who is arrested for killing her husband and sister.  When Roxy murders the man she has been cheating on her husband with, she begins to be put in the spotlight.  When she hires the best, most manipulative lawyer in Chicago, Billie Flynn (Gere), Velma feels Roxy is stealing her thunder.  Zellweger and Jones both pull out their roles fabulously, while Richard Gere is the only casting mistake, that cannot ruin the film,  Chicago.
B000002O5L|5.0|13 years after his debut release, Tom Petty decided to an album without the Heartbreakers.  Released in 1989, it proved to be his best album ever.  Each and every song on here is a gem.<br />Most rock music fans know the classic hits like the understated yet fiesty &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot;, the melodious &quot;Free Fallin'&quot;, and the best driving song of all time, the rocking &quot;Runnin' Down a Dream&quot;.  Equally as great are other rock radio releases and more minor singles like the catchy, somewhat melodic &quot;Love Is A Long Road&quot; and the mellow, mystical &quot;Face in the Crowd&quot;.  &quot;Yer So Bad&quot; is also simply rollicking good fun, as is the closing rocker &quot;Zombie Zoo&quot;.  The melodies of &quot;Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot; and the catchy sound of &quot;A Mind With a Heart of Its Own&quot; are also memorable.<br /><br />The truth is, all 12 tracks from this album are memorable to me this many years after its release.  Not many albums are of this incredible quality from beginning to end.  Tom Petty has had an absolutely brilliant career of writing and recording music, and this one simply represents him at his peak.  I recommend many Tom Petty albums, but I would say that this one is absolutely the best of the best.  Highly recommended for classic rock collectors who enjoy the brilliant simplicity of music such as this.  Then again, what artist has been anything like this man the past 25 years or so?  None that I can think of.  TP is one of a kind, and this is an absolute classic.
0066620996|4.0|Good to Great offers some great insights to the things companies need to do (and keep doing) to achieve lasting greatness.  Like most truths, these insights apply not only to large corporations, but also to small businesses, and even to individuals' personal lives.  One of these insights is what the book calls the hedgehog concept which involves focusing on the right simple idea.  Because the book applies this concept, it is a relatively quick and easy read.  I was not a fan of Collins' earlier book, Built to Last, but fortunately Collins seems to have taken his new book to heart and gone from good (or worse) to great.

B00006JKLI|5.0|Ok, I am a cynic when it comes to the industry telling me that the latest and greatest is later and greater than what they last sold me on. The last time it really was true was back in 1986 when I got my first CD player. Well, it's happened again. I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW THIS DVD AUDIO FORMAT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!! Do whatever it takes and buy this. I thought I knew every note and nuance on Fragile. I was wrong. I mean, my CATS stopped walking around to listen to Steve Howe's opening guitar HOVER over my head, suspended in mid air for an eternity! Steve was inside my living room. Jon's vocals, Wakemans floor moving organs and synths, Squire and Bruford in house-shaking POWER! Not rattling, not vibrating, actually like an earthquake. You will not be dissapointed and nothing I said can come close to what its like....if its between food and this DVD then don't eat today....buy this DVD!!!...
B000084T18|5.0|this cd has to be one of the best rap cds i've listened to in years. i love it. hasn't left my cd player since i got it and it's gonna be there for a while. Eminem definitly produced some talent and his input on patiently waiting is unbelievable... go out and get this cd

B000002JR8|5.0|Wow, this album is truely the prime example of a metal album. Every metal band thats about to go to the studio should listen to this first. This is without a doubt my favorite Pantera album. \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" wastes no time getting the boys doing what they do best just tearing it up. \\"Becoming\\" has become a classic that almost every nu-metal or metal band does with the high pitch riffs of Dimebag. \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" needs no introduction if you haven't heard this then go back to Nickelback or something. \\"I'm Broken\\" is very grooving and heavy track that has become a trademark in the band's setlist. \\"Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills\\" is probably one of the more disturbing Pantera songs that Phil has written. \\"Slaughtered\\" perfectly showcases just why this album is so heavy. Phil screams at the top of his voice and growls during the verses. The ending cover song of Black Sabbath \\"Planet Caravan\\" upstages even the original. Along with Metallica's Master of Puppets, this album is a must have if your going to get into metal.
B0000039PW|5.0|Man, what can I say about the BI.G, which has not just been said, but proved on this album by his immense tallent and genieus to be the best lyricist of ALL time. From when the first beat dropped in the track \\"things gun changed\\" to the last beat of \\"sucicidal thoughts\\", I was completely glued to the tape deck!!!. Track After Track, HIT after HIT man, for real, this guy will never be outdone. If it was not for this guy, and this particular album, Id probably be listening to the spice girls for my kicks..............<br />If you know what I'm on .. then \\"keep it real\\"<BR>This Aint no Cliche. Its A MUST FOR EVERYONE COLLECTION!!! So make sure you dont sell yourself short and get your hands on a copy!!!!<br />Peace out
0385473788|5.0|I haven't finished this book, but I started it last night and I am on page 235. It is so fascinating- especially because anything that surprises you, any action or happening, you know that it truly did happen. I am loving reading it, because it's funny and her feelings are very true and realistic. The only part I am confused about is torward the end she stops talking about the happenings around her but more about her feelings- I wanted to hear a little of both, a happy medium but it is kind of hard to follow because you are not sure exactly what she's talking about.Other than that, it is so awesome! I know it will be sad, the ending, but enough said about that. I hope you enjoy it!
0066214122|5.0|For two days, I could barely put this book down. This time Crichton's plot revolves around nano computers and an unemployed father of three, Jack, who believes his wife is having an affair. Jack's real problems begin the instant his infant daughter wakes up screaming in the night from a mysterious rash but in short order he's called upon to save the world from uncontrollable swarms of deadly nano computers. (Luckily Jack's an unemployed computer code writer, and it's his code on predator and prey behavior that the tiny computers are running on.) <BR> <BR>Prey reminds me both of The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, with a great balance of story and science. The concepts in Prey are quite realistic and terrifying and the suspense in the last half of the book is incredible. (Plus, Michael Crichton was years ahead of his time with the misuse of cloning theme used in Jurassic Park, so I think that adds an element of credibility to his ideas.) <br />I admit that there are a couple of too convenient contrivances, and the ultimate outcome is somewhat sudden and movie-ish (Without a doubt there will be a movie version) but Prey remains a great story. I enjoyed it immensely and can't wait for Crichton's next!
B00003CXXM|3.0|I started reading this book on a vacation and got so enthralled that I actually read when I got home (I don't read much at home).  I intentionally waited to see the movie until I had finished the book.  Big mistake.  I was so disgusted by the &quot;free adaptation&quot; that I could not even enjoy the movie.  Every second was filled with &quot;wait a second, that's not how it was supposed to be.&quot;  It wasn't until months later when I saw the movie again on DVD that I even was able to evaluate it on its own.  From watching the DVD and totally ignoring what I remember of the book, the film isn't too bad, but there should be some kind of warning before films that are &quot;freely adapted&quot; from books, especially ones as good as The Bourne Identity.
B000002UKS|4.0|This album is very nearly perfect, and is by far the Foo Fighters best.  I only have two problems with this CD that made me give it four stars.  First, February Stars is total trash.  Not only do I have to skip it when I listen to the CD, I start to feel depressed at the end of Enough Space because I know that February Stars is coming.  It's that bad.  Second, I like the song Walking After You, but it goes on for a minute or so too long.  I wish they would have stopped when the song was obviously over, but instead they kept going.  That said, Everlong and My Poor Brain are two of the finest songs ever, and certainly make up for those two problems, and the rest of the CD also is very good.
B000001FE0|5.0|As a huge fan of the Brothers Gibb, I have every album/cd they have ever released commercially, and this is by far their crowning achievement.  &quot;Odessa&quot; is a magnum opus full of richly melodic and exquisitely beautiful songs.  The haunting title track gives me goose bumps every time I hear the opening and <BR>ending verses.  &quot;Lamplight&quot; is one of the Bee Gees' most gorgeous and vocally complex songs, with Robin showcasing his unique and trademark &quot;drainpipe&quot; vibrato to its fullest extent.<BR>And &quot;Odessa&quot; contains my two all-time favorite Bee Gees songs: &quot;Melody Fair&quot; &amp; &quot;First of May&quot;.  &quot;Melody Fair&quot; has, unquestionably and without a doubt, the most beautiful, well, melody I have ever heard in a pop song.  It conveys an air of childlike innocence more perfectly than any other song I've ever heard.  And &quot;First of May&quot;  is a beautifully written and arranged vignette, telling an achingly poignant tale of love and loss.  This song holds the distinction of being the second song that ever made me cry the first time I heard it; the first being<BR>&quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; by the Beatles.  &quot;Odessa&quot; is also the first and only Bee Gees album to showcase instrumental songs: &quot;Seven Seas Symphony&quot;, &quot;With All Nations&quot;  and &quot;The British Opera.&quot;  Simply put, I ADORE this album.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Last Summer's Spider-Man reeled in mass amounts of dollars for Marvel, and that's not where it stops. More movies are coming out, and the most recent one is Daredevil. Not as mainstream to non-comic fans as Spider-Man and Batman (more than likely because DD never had his own show), Daredevil is a very dark comic movie, unlike X-Men and Spider-Man, but like the original Batman and Spawn.<br />Now, I am NOT an Affleck fan. I don't have anything aganist him, but I'm not a fan, and I wasn't as excited about this movie as I was for X-Men and Spider-Man, because I'm not used to Daredevil (for reasons suggested above), and because Ben Affleck. He seems like the last person to do Daredevil. Let's just hope Seann William Scott isn't really The Hulk...<br />Now the story, even though I'm not sure how true it is to the original comic: 12-year old Matt Murdoc lives with his pro-boxer father in Hell's Kitchen. Well, one day Matt takes a short cut through a chemical site, and sees his dad harassing a man. In a state of confusion and anger, Matt runs off, and is blinded by a chemical spilled out of a can into his eyes. But, frm his blindness, gains super-human powers to his remaining senses. His dad is killed later by Kingpin, the man who seemingly runs all crime in New York. He vows to keep the city safe for the rest of his life, and becomes Daredevil. <br />Now, in Daredevil there are two main villians: the highly entertaining Bullseye (who dies way too soon), and a black Kingpin, who I can remember from an appearence in a Spider-Man cartoon.<br />I reccomend this if you are just looking for a good action movie, or are a comic book nut, or if you're overly obsessed with Ben Affleck. And there's a cameo with Kevin \\"Silent Bob\\" Smith in here as well...
B000002OMN|5.0|Damn. I was blown away when I heard this CD!!! I'd Do Anything for Love is one of the best songs ever written. All types of emotions are caught on this CD. From hating your life, to falling in love and things going from bad to worse, this CD has at least one song people can relate to. GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!
B00006JKLI|5.0|This DVD-Audio version is full of revelations-the separation and clarity of the vocals, guitar riffs, fat bass lines, ethereal keyboards, and tiniest snare rattles; the ambiance of the solo pieces (esp. Cans &amp; Brahms, Mood for a Day, and We Have Heaven). Its like hearing these songs for the first time. Really, they sound that different! A fantanstic high-resolution 5.1 mix. Go out and get a DVD-A player right now!
B000056NX5|5.0|This is a fantastic version of my all time favorite musical. Jesus and Judas Play their parts perfectly. Much better than the 1973 version b/c it's more realistic, and more intense musically. Get this if you like Jim Steinman and Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell, and you might still like it even if you don't.
0060989157|5.0|It is refreshing for a band to pen a book that isn't the usual self-promoting, self-indulgent ... that stains the book market.  I came away with no respect for these guys, but found them somewhat likable in that they came clean and didn't try to paint themselves as \\"rock gods\\".  In their honesty, they portray themselves as difficult, and relate their lack of maturity in business, music, and life.  They admit to poor performances and criticize their own music in the drug-induced efforts of Theatre of Pain and Girls, Girls, Girls.  Definitely a good read.  The book ranks right up there with the Zeppelin bio Hammer of the Gods and the Doors bio Break on Through.
B000002UB3|5.0|Take the greatest band in the history of rock. Make them hate each other to the point of disgust. Then put them in a recording studio to record their last album. Will it rock? Will it suck? No, neither. It will become the greatest rock album of all time. Not Revolver, not Sgt. Pepper. Abbey Road was The Beatles' exclamation point. And at the heels of their breakup, all they had to offer was some of the best material these boys from Liverpool ever recorded. From Lennon's \\"Come Together\\" to Harrison's historic love song \\"Something\\" to McCartney's epic medleys at the end, this album can convert any Beatle hater. Perhaps the true genius behind all of this was producer George Martin, who somehow found a way to convince the quartet to come together (no pun intended) and record \\"the way we used to.\\" Already all but decided on splitting (after all, they couldn't agree on anything at this point), The Beatles reluctantly said yes to their longtime producer and walked into the studio on Abbey Road to create this masterpiece. Its melodies are like every other Beatle album - infectious. Its songwriting shows true craftsmanship. Its production is phenomenal. And this album contains the greatest B-side ever (for you kiddies, that's the second half of the album ... \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and on). The only drawbacks on this album are Ringo's \\"Octopus's Garden\\" (I've tried, but I still don't like that song) and ladder part of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" ... just a minute too long for me. Had there been a more rocking guitar solo (I don't know, maybe invite Clapton again), I may have accepted it a little more. Nonetheless, Abbey still remains The Beatles' greatest achievement.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Renee Zellweger stars in this musical ode to the jazz-era.  She plays Roxie, a not-too-bright star-wannabe who idolizes Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, Velma, a ruthless cabaret singer-dancer.  Both women just happen to be killers and are in jail at the same time.  Queen Latifah plays Mama, the easily-bribed matron.  Richard Gere plays Roxie and Velma's attorney, Billy Flynn.<br /><br />  The musical numbers are big, loud, and splashy, and exist mostly in Roxie's imagination.  All of the stars do their own singing and dancing, and are all surprisingly good.  The music deserves five stars.  What I didnd't like were the script and cast.  The pace of the film is frenetic; watching it is exhausting.  I would have liked some quiet moments, but that isn't what this film is about.<br /><br />  While all the stars were good, I found the casting just plain odd.  Renee Zellweger still looks like Briget Jones; Zeta-Jones is practically unrecognizable in that make-up and wig and is way too one-dimensional.  Gere can sing and dance, but it's  so strange seeing him do it!  He just doesn't look like a singing/dancing lawyer.<br /><br />  The script and cast rate three stars from me; the wonderful music gets 5 stars.
B00006JDVV|2.0|I put my philosophical brain to rest and intended to just go along with the thrill ride of this movie however the ride just wasn't very exciting or adventurous. Richard Zanuck (who also produced Jaws) just fails to elicit the same fear or cinematic enthusiasm with these giant fire breathing creatures.<br />I can enjoy science fiction with minimal special effects if they are good. The visual special effects of this movie, however were just plain mediocre. Although a dark medieval mood was created, the darkness actually detracted from much of the visual effect. Vivid images of the dragons were lacking and the basic premise of the movie was so severly bland that the special effects just aren't capable of making up for that.<br />The DTS Surround Sound effects were good and the powerplay between characters played by Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale add something worthwhile.<br />The good surround sound and special visual effects which created enormous, flying, fire breathing dragons just are not enough to raise this movie from the depths of a fiery cinematic hell.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I bought the &quot;AI:Artificial Intelligence&quot; DeLuxe Double DVD set with all the bells and whistles for about eight dollars at a used bookstore. That should have been the tipoff right there.<br /><br /> I can't imagine what sort of demographic the target audience for this movie could be. However, calling AI &quot;Sceince Fiction&quot; is a stretch, since most of what takes place is more in the realm of fantasy. Modern sceince basically tells us what can be possible, and based on what is known about what is and is not possible, something like the scenario described will never happen.<br /><br /> Overall, the movie looks and feels like a tired version of Pinnochio, an awful story in its own right. The screenplay is basically built around this non-human kid-thing with feelings that eventually gets caught up in a quagmire of its own making. Like the wooden puppet created by Gepetto, it wants to be a real boy.<br /><br /> AI is not about what may or may not take place in the future, because the question of whether or not human beings can create life itself is rather supercilious. Instead, much of what takes place in AI is more in the realm of fantasy, because the story itself is based on physical implausibility.<br /><br /> For example, the human characters in the story look, act and behave pretty much like human beings do in the twenty-first century. In the event that human beings were ever able to create high-functioning entities from inanimate matter in the complexity this film describes at great length, then they would cease to resemble human beings. By that time, the human race would have evolved into some form that would make all of us look like neanderthals.<br /><br /> AI is not sceince fiction, anymore than &quot;High Noon&quot; was a western. AI is a morality play, pure and simple. The message has more to do with the acceptance of artificial intelligence as a gateway to Godlike empowerment, sans spirituality. The future of the world as portrayed in AI is immoral, without feeling, without compassion. It is heartless, cold, and if you get the message behind AI, we're all headed that way.<br /><br /> In the future, those quiet, Sunday picnics with your kids in the back yard will be lost and gone forever, because on the next lot over are a man and woman who like to get dressed up in leather and get into some great S and M action with you and your wife. You won't even think about your kids, because they'll be entertained at an amusement park filled with freaks and geeks as characters in fantasy games.<br /><br /> Instantaneous travel to anywhere on earth will be available to all citizens; Plans to make everything from methampetamine to bombs made from fertilizer and fuel oil will be sold by vending machines; Devil worship will become obsolete because the concept of spirituality will be dead; Violent, pornographic images will become contemporary art that can be purchased at discount stores.<br /><br /> But none of this will matter anyway, because by that time, all human beings will understand that the pursuit of Artificial Intelligence, not love or procreation, not the human pursuits of art, literature, or music and certainly not metaphysics, is the reason that the human race must continue to exist.<br /><br /> The story of Pinnochio was cold, but this scenario is a sheer wall of ice. The human characters portrayed are, basically, less human than the robots they are struggling to create. They react to situations in ways that seem rather arbitrary and almost nonsensical at times, given the circumstances.<br /><br /> More than likely, if you believe in some concept of God (whether it involves Allah, Jesus, Buddah, or Cosmic Muffin), and you are trying to maintain some measure of hope, then &quot;AI&quot; probably is not for you.<br /><br /> It was truly a hateful experience to watch this dog. The thing seemed to go on and on, forever. Then, when I thought it was going to finally end, the aliens showed up. I can't tell you how cheated I felt. The next day, I sold it back to the store that I bought it from. I couldn't wait to get rid of it.<br /><br /> Oh well... Word of mouth took this film out of the theatres and hopefully, word of mouth will erase this pile of garbage from history.t it from. I couldn't wait to get rid of it.      Oh well...

0553108034|5.0|I highly recommend this book, but make sure you read &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; first. It will be much more enjoyable, and the story and characters will make much more sense if you do.<br />   This is how a fantasy epic should be written. In comparison, J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is slow and stilted, Raymond Feist's &quot;Magician&quot; is a predictable bore and Robert Jordan's &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; is plodding. The only other fantasy I've enjoyed as much is Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea trilogy -- although George R.R. Martin's series is very different.<br />   Martin grabs you from the first page and doesn't let you go. His characters are believable and interesting, the dialogue true. Unlike other fantasy epics that feature the same old cast -- innocent protagonist, helpful wizard and bold warrior (not to mention knockoffs of elves, trolls, goblins, etc.) -- Martin's characters are all human and very real.<br />   &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; has much more magic than the first book, and it is presented with originality. For example, instead of having dragons fly around and simply roast everyone to a crisp, he features them as immature pups that do very little in the novel except increase magic users' abilities (you'll understand what I'm talking about when you read the book).<br />   There's more of the intrigue, betrayal and gripping suspense that is featured in the first book, and one of my favorite characters of all time, Tyrion, plays a very prominent role. If you're rooting for this guy, you won't be disappointed.<br />   I can't say enough about this book and am eagerly starting on the third in the series.
B00005MP58|5.0|I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I have viewed this program over 40 times. And I am a middle-aged man. I have read the novel 3 times though it will probably be some time before I read it again. Like the film adaptation, I wish someone would contemporize the language, just a little bit, to make it easier to read. It wouldn't take many subtle changes to bring it alive again for modern readers.<br />This film adaptation and the performances are excellent. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are wonderful to watch. Darcy's angst is palpable as he is drawn to Elizabeth Bennet in spite of the difference in social class and the impropriety of her family.<br />It must be time to watch it again.....
B00005OAIE|3.0|The lyrics are amazing, John's voice is amazing, the songs are usually amazing but not on this album.  If you want a CD that has an accurate representation of John's incredible talent, buy Inside Wants Out or Any Given Thursday.  The beauty of John's lyrics, guitar, and vocals is ruined by the over-polished, over-produced sound.  However, John is certainly one of the most talented musicians; the less than usual quality of this album is not his fault.

B000088E6M|5.0|I Brought this CD when it first came out.  I just can't put it down. There is nothing to skip over.  I don't even skip over the intro.  Every song on here could be a single.  50 said it best when he said he said &quot;If David can go after Goliath with a stone/then I can go at Nas and Jigga for the throne.&quot;  I think he is on the level.  I look for big things on his Sophmore release.  The song that I listen to the most though is 21 questions.  It is a very good song.  It is something the fellas can sing to they girl and get good responses.  50 outshines anybody who drops and album this year.  If you don't have it then get it. G-G-G-G-G- Unit
0151008116|5.0|I'm a little surprised at the extremely negative comments from some of the reviewers here.  Martel's parable on &quot;truth&quot; is told from the viewpoint of one of the more engaging characters of recent fiction.  Pi's discourses on his growing up in Pondicherry are good reading if for no other reason than that Pi &quot;tells&quot; his story so well and his &quot;adventures&quot; on the life boat are a great tale.  I'm not sure I agree with Martel's apparent premise, that we can't tell what the truth is so why not go with the most comforting or whatever but nevertheless, he has put his idea forward in an engaging and witty way that I enjoyed from beginning to end.
B0000508U6|5.0|I cant say enough about this cd.  I had no idea who Coldplay was until I heard &quot;Yellow&quot; and after listening to that, I got interested. After listening to Parachutes, I was left in amazement. Each song was beautifully made and the lyrics were incredible.  My personal favorite is Shiver.   If you want a cd that exemplifies music at its best, go out and get Parachutes by Coldplay, you won't regret it.
0553573403|5.0|Being a fantasy book enthusiast is alot like searching for gold during the 19th century gold rush.  You have to slog through alot of dirt, mud and general filth in order to find just a few nuggets of the shiny stuff.  George R.R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is probably the biggest nugget that I have yet found.<br />The book defies hasty description.  I've read that it can be summed up as a \\"War of the Roses\\" type setting with different families vying for power, but that simply does not do the book justice.  Court intrigue, sex, violence; Martin does not shy away from the worst descriptions.  And boy can Martin write!<br />Every character is unique and interesting-there are no cardboard cut-out figues who can be neatly seperated into good and bad. The story is told through multiple points of views, from a medieval kingdom/town type setting to old wind-swept outposts to fascinating foreign lands and cultures. However, the part of the book that hooked me most was its unpredicatable nature. \\"Good guys\\" die with unsettling regularity; I defy anyone to read the book and claim that they could have predicted events.<br />So there you have it.  An exciting fantasy from an author who knows how to write and that actually gets better as the series progresses. Get it now!
B00005YW4H|3.0|While my rating may infuriate Norah Jones's diehard fans, I found this CD to be pleasant but not extraordinary. It's certainly not a CD you can play at anytime because of its solemn, and somewhat depressing, playlist. She's better than most of the young talent out there but that's only because there's a mediocre level of talent in popular music. On the positive side, she should get better with age if she has the right material.
B00000BKE1|2.0|If I wasn't such a nice guy, I'd say that Iron Maiden (i.e. Steve Harris) have written the same song over and over again with a little variation from time to time. And this release \\"Fear of the dark\\" is no exception. The title track is by far the best song but that doesn't really say much. \\"Fear of the dark\\" is mainly for [real]Maiden fans, others will find much more pleasure in earlier efforts like \\"The number of the beast\\" or \\"Piece of mind\\".
B00005N919|5.0|On a scale from 1 to 10, I give this masterpiece a 12!!!<BR>Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas team up to make this the ultimate murder thriller.  It gets kind of rough in places, but this film works your mind til the very end.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I never ever buy albums on listening to one song, until I heard 'all the things she said'. I bought the album almost straight away and I am absolutely intoxicated by it! Definitely an album which when you sit back, relax and close your eyes, takes you to another place.<BR>The few tracks sung in their native tongue are beautiful. Never know russian could sound so good.<BR>Absolute talent - hope their next album is half as good as this one!!!

B000002IWQ|4.0|This 1993 release continues the re-evolution that Rush began with Presto and Roll the Bones, renewing their strength as THE hard rock power trio. Overlooked in a period when Nirvana, Pearl Jam and a host of now defunct grunge/alternative/modern rock bands were the music du jour, this record really rocks!<br />I wouldn't call this a starter disk, but it blows away all of the mid-eighties synth/tech stuff.<br />It's true that the music is polished, perhaps over-produced, but I would expect nothing less from the seasoned veterans Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart. As musicians, they still run circles around their younger contemporaries.<br />Animate kicks off with some powerful groove bass and drums and a hint of organ, with Lifeson's guitar layered above it all. I like the lyrics &quot;goddess in my garden/sister in my soul/angel in my armor/actress in my role&quot; because it echoes the idea of Counterparts. We all have the duality of male/female, yin/yang, light/shadow to deal with, and this song cycle deals with a lot of these issues.<br />Stick It Out starts off with a crunchy AC/DC type riff and I have to admit that some Whitesnake lyrical imagery comes to mind, but there's a lot more depth here. It's about letting your emotions out and not holding back in life.<br />Cut to the Chase builds into a groove, then enter the guitars and this tune has some terrific intensity. I like that Geddy Lee has tempered his bass to more funky lines than busy melodies, and Peart's drumming is balanced well in the mix.<br />&quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; is the power ballad of the set, with acoustic guitars, keyboards and social issues that touch more personal notes than is typical of the usual detachment of Peart's lyrics.<br />Other cuts I enjoy include &quot;Between Sun and Moon&quot; with its uplifting spirit, and &quot;Alien Shore&quot; with more hints of the Counterparts theme with &quot;you and I, we are strangers by one chromosome/slave to the hormone, body and soul&quot; and brilliant guitars by Lifeson. &quot;Double Agent&quot; has some interesting twists and turns, a good use of spoken lyric &quot;on the edge of sleep/I was drifting for half the night...&quot; and cool fusion rhythm a la vintage Rush.<br />There's even a new instrumental &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; where Geddy Lee gets to show off some bass skills, and Lifeson moves through a range of styles and sounds. Do you catch a hint of Yes when you hear this one?<br />&quot;Cold Fire&quot; examines a relationship in more realistic terms. &quot;She said just don't disappoint me/you know how complex women are/I'll be aournd/If you don't let me down/too far.&quot;<br />This disk has strengths all the way through, which makes it a satisfying listen, and means that I'll listen to it with some regularity.<br />The disk package is also one of Rush's better presentations, with clever photos on the Counterparts theme, little puzzles, and pictures of the band members that display their sense of humor and outside interests.guitars by Lifeson. &quot;Double Agent&quot; has some interesting twists and turns, a good use of spoken lyric &quot;on the edge of sleep/I was drifting for half the night...&quot; and cool fusion rhythm a la vintage Rush.<BR>There's even a new instrumental &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; where Geddy Lee gets to show off some bass skills, and Lifeson moves through a range of styles and sounds.

1563898586|5.0|For those who think that reading comic books are a waste of time and that graphic novels aren't anywhere near real literature, this is one comic you should check out and which maybe even change your mind. The illustrations are amazing, capturing the essence of the time period in which the story takes place. The story is written by the great Alan Moore (what more needs to be said), so the plot is intense; the action fierce; and the characters fully developed. That in itself is enough to purchase this little book. However, besides great illustrations and an excellent story, this graphic novel taught me more about 19th century literature than I ever learned during my four years as an undergraduate English major. I read a great deal and love 19th century literature and history, but I was only able to pick up on about 60% of the references in the story on my own. The rest I had to look up. It was a wonderful educating experience that has opened my eyes to a whole dimension of stories I never knew existed before. Nevertheless, the immense references and allusions should not scare the uneducated reader away. Even if you have never read any 19th century literature and know very little about the period in history, the story is still an excellent read and thoroughly enjoyable. Happy reading.
0140288503|4.0|I am fascinated with the events of Black Hawk Down in 1993 and studying them. This book gives all the information needed! At only 14, I am not a huge fan of war novels, but this one is special. Unlike most war novels, which tend to be too &quot;technical&quot;, this novel actually lets you feel a sense of compassion for the characters. Other war books commonly can't do that.<br />The book, I think, is very interesting. Not only does it give you complete analysis, but I feel like I am a person there, even more so than I did when watching the film. Mark Bowden keeps the premise simple to understand, which makes it easier and more engaging for people to read and follow. The descriptions are insightful and vivid, and the feelings of the characters are comprehensively described in the book. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the Black Hawk Down incident.
B00005OWEG|3.0|I will save you a synopsis of this film - I'll assume you have a working knowledge of the film.  This is a review of the Redux DVD.<br />The added scenes were a mixed bag.  The long-discussed French plantation sequence has been restored and included.  I think this bizarre set piece brings the movie closer to the original Conrad source, as it touches on the absurdity of the situation Willard and the sailors find themselves in.  But the sequence was overlong and seemed not to further the story but simply to narrate many of the themes Coppola already expressed in the original film.  The added portions of the Kilgore segment seemed completely out of character.  Yes, Willard bonds with the sailors when he steals the surfboard, but it is completely out of context with the rest of their experience together.  The sailors don't like him, and he resents being on the ship with them.  That makes this sequence gratuitous.<br />Speaking of gratuitous, the medivac scene with the bunnies is a disapointing addition.  What was the point of that, other than to see the playmates' breasts?  If you want gratuitous female nudity, there are thousands of other DVDs out there for you.  Why tarnish a movie masterpiece with this scene more worthy of an American Pie sequel?<br />I was also very disappointed by the extras, or lack thereof.  A movie this good deserves a full package of extras.  No movie in recent memory has a more colorful behind-the-scenes story, and I would have loved to have seen this story represented in this disc.  And finally, no audio commentary?  Why?<br />The only reason this disc gets 3 stars is becuase of the source material.  Otherwise, this DVD is very disappointing.
B00000AFWW|5.0|When this album came out in '98, my non-Hole fan friends couldn't understand my dissatisfaction with it.  \\"It sounds okay.  And that Celebrity Skin song is catchy.\\"  I didn't know how to explain the betrayal I felt that Ms. love went from Teenage Whore to Violet to...Petals?  And I came up with this weak meatphor: Tori Amos and Rage Against the Machine are both good artists.  However, if Rage decided to pull out a piano and sing introspective songs--and performed them as well as Tori has for the last decade --we would hate it.  We'd scream \\"Stick to what you know!\\"  After about forty more listens and four months, I changed my mind.  This album IS Hole, just a little more stuble and, yes, a bit more quiet.<br />Lyrically, this album is as distinctive Courtney Love as ever.  She deals with many of her trademark issues: abuse, love/sex, death, celebrity and superficiality.  The lyrics could have been in any Live Through This song and would have fit semlessly.  But the input of such collaborators/producers as Billy Corgan is felt on many songs, as many reviewers have pointed out.  But I think two very important influences have not been mentioned: Los Angeles and time.<br />While Live Through This fit in with the what was coming out of Seattle in the early 90s, Celebrity Skin is very Los Angeles.  Courtney Love even said this album was about \\"being an LA woman.\\"  In Malibu, you could swaer it was stolen from the Go-Gos--so poppy and upbeat.  But time has also worked on Courtney.  She has since cleaned up her addictions, starred in a few movies, modelled for Versace and continued to rasie her daughter.  Also, the loss of Hole bassist Kisten Plaff in '94 and replacement with the very capacable Melissa Auf Der Maur changed the band.  Courtney's a different person.  And Hole's a different band.<br />The true stand-outs on this album are Hit So Hard, Reasons to be Beautiful, Boys on the Radio, and Petals.  Many of these are ballads (I discovered Hole can write decent ballads!).  Hit So Hard is incredibly melodic, while Reasons to be Beautiful is one of the best put-together rock songs of the late-90s.  Hole fans will remember Boys on the Radio as Sugarcoma (as performed on MTV's Hole Unplugged).  It has the same verses, but a chorus and bridge was added.  The chorus is hauting (\\"In your endless summer night/I'll be on the other side/When you're beautiful and dying/all the world that you've denied/When the water is too deep/you can close your eyes and really sleep/Tonight, Tonight\\").  Petals, the final track of the album, is a culmination: mournful and soft, it ends the album beautifully.<br />Everyone from Courtney to informed passerby knew this album couldn't be released without speculation about Kurt-related lyrics.  As a game, my friends and I sat around and tried to make the lyrics be about Kurt (but we were drunk and bored).  So many can be twisted, but many seem to be intentionally directed to him.  The oft-mentioned exmaple is from Reason To Be Beautiful.  Towards in the end, Courtney sings, \\"It's better to rise than fade away,\\" an obvious reply to Kurt's suicide note's Neil Young quote, \\"It's better to burn out than fade away.\\"  Also seemingly obvous is Playing Your Song.  The whole song is about an exploited musician whose fans resurrected malls to sell his music and betray everything he stood for.<br />Is this album Live Through This, Part 2?  No.  Is it \\"punk\\" or \\"grunge\\"?  Probably not (whatever those terms mean now, anyway).  Is it a incredible power-pop album?  Absolutely!s!).

B000002J20|5.0|There is no middle ground with Tales from Topographic Oceans - you either love it or wonder how Yes could go so wrong.<br />I happen to love it.  It does not rock the same way that the songs on Close to the Edge and Fragile rock.  This is a composition of Mahlerian length.  The original LP was a double album with only four songs - one side per song at an average of 20 minutes per song.  <br />But the results!  The opening Revealing Science of God has amazing vocals and great instrumental interludes.  The final Rituals builds to a great climax and ends with one of the loveliest moments in Yes.  The Remembering has great keyboard work by Wakeman and also builds nicely.  OK, for me The Ancient does wander off course despite Steve Howe's excellent guitar work.  But for such a long album that's the only weak spot.<br />This is not a dance album or an album to jam to, despite some great rock moments.  This is for you to listen to on the headphones and meditate/dream/whatever.  True this is a LONG journey, but there is so much you will encounter along the way.<br />If I was stuck on a desert island and could only have one Yes CD with me, I'd probably select Close to the Edge - but I'd want this one too if I could.  Close to the Edge may be my favorite Yes album, but Tales may be their best.  Certainly their most amazing.
B000002L9J|5.0|the whole albums incredible and Morrissey was the best thing to happen to 80's pop.
B00008DDXC|3.0|Chamber of Secres is my favorite among the Harry Potter books but I had mixed feelings about the film version.  The special effects are eye popping and the pace is amazing for a film over 2 1/2 hours long.  The actors, young and old, do a fine acting job and this is a good final bow for great British actor Richard Harris as Dumbledore.<br />That said, the movie leaves something to be desired.  I will try not to spoil anything with the plot, since these are basically mystery stories.  In the book Rowlings carefully keeps certain characters in front of you or on the periphery so when you find out exactly what is happening and why, it makes sense.  Rowlings is devious in her plotting and great with red herrings but she does play fair.<br />In the Chris Columbus film there are important characters and plot elements that are shown once and do not recur until the very end.  So if you don't know the book, when you reach the conclusion of this film I could see viewers going \\"Who was that again?\\"  The adult characters in particular, mostly excellent British actors, seem to be having cameo roles when they play more important roles in the book (although Kenneth Branaugh is a wonderfully self centered Lockhart).  <br />I realize you cannot put any book onto the screen exactly.  Things have to be rearranged or removed or the film will go on forever.  So I do not mind that we see next to nothing of Neville Longbottom in this film - he is a rather unimportant character in this particular story.    <br />The result is a film that hits the important plot elements of the story but builds up little suspense or mystery.  It has magical special effects but the real magic of Rowling's books remains elusive.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I thought this film was wonderfully done. It takes a lot of work to take something from the stage to the screen. This brilliantlly-made film was brought to life with its hip musical numbers that make you want to get out of your seat and break into song, and with its breathtaking cast, but this could not have been nearly as good without the performance of Catherine Zeta-Jones, who's performance I was taken aback by. The set design is not as creative as Moulin Rouge, but this movie is much easier to get into. I totally recommend this film for everyone, even if you're not into musicals.
B00005JLRR|2.0|In this 10th installment of the Star Trek franchise we are lucky enough to be graced by the presence of Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Levar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, and last but certainly not least the beautiful Deanna Troi now turned Deanna Troi Riker at the beginning of the film played by Marina Sirtis.  This film while attempting to cater to a general audience, is still a film about family.  The crew of the Enterprise has become family as well as part of our television heritage over the last 15 years.  So naturally the beginning of the film focuses on what's going on with the family, and also more importantly how they are beginning to part.  It has been 4 years since we last saw them in the anything but perfect \\"Insurrection,\\" the 3rd in the Next Gen series of the franchise.  This time we are not in the trusted hands of Jonathan Frakes who can take a script like \\"Insurrection\\" and make it watchable using technique and getting solid performances by his fellow cast mates.  This time we are in the hands of experienced action director Stuart Baird, who tries to generalize Star Trek and make it accessible to everyone forgetting the material is very limited in audience span to begin with.  Therefore, in the process delevers us some bologna on wheat direction as to where this film is going and the essence of what it is suppose to be...  A Star Trek picture.  This film does not work anyone hard and that is the generalization of it.  The cast's talents are not being displayed to their fullest, at least not their most important talents that would be crucial to the film.  Brent Spiner who plays one of my personal favorite characters Data, sings a dreaded song called \\"Blue Skies.\\"  A song that I have a painful memory of, being an actor myself.  Through the rest of the film, he proves to be the bright and shining point playing Data the android who has reached the end of his quest for humanity in this film and now understands and behaves more like humans than ever before.  Data and B4 were in essence the same except for technological advances between them making Data more advanced.  I thought that the idea of making another android other than Lore from the TV series was a juvenile ... attempt at creating hope for a fifth film role reprisal from Spiner now 53, who is getting too old for the part.  Star Trek is truly ending and the signaling for the end was the beginning of \\"Voyager\\", the fourth television installment of the franchise.  We know longer get fed intelligent situations that involve ethical and moral dillemnas, we now get fed [a movie] that involves monsters that are computer rendered and sometimes makeup assisted, and CGI ships that look totally unconvincing as opposed to motion control that was used in the earlier days and was much more costly, we get these big behemoth looking enemy battle ships that look as threatening as my 9 year old little brother on a motorized horse ride.  Star Trek has boldly gone where no one has gone before...  In the past.  But, just because we were excited by it then, doesn't mean we want to repeat the same journeys over and over again for another 40 years.  To Star Trek:  Shape up!  Or report to spacedock to be decommisioned.
0060278269|5.0|Basically, i gave this book 5 stars because it did a very good job of finishing the quest begun in LIRAEL and tying that book in with SABRIEL (both of which, if you haven't read them and you're reading this review, you should STOP NOW and GET THEM FIRST - they are AWESOME!! and a must-read preclude to even have a clue as to what ...is going on in ABHORSEN)<BR>interesting diversion. anyway, the story begun in LIRAEL is nicely tied up, with lots of inconsequential implications that can be resolved (and probably will be, i hope, given the author's style) in a follow-up book. <BR>ABOUT THIS BOOK - Lirael, her nephew Sam, the Dog and Mogget leave the Abhorsen's House after a bit of maneuvering (they have to take an unexpected way out b/c many dead are waiting on either side of the river, led by Chlorr of the Mask, who makes her debut reappearance) and begin working towards getting to the Red Lake, not without some problems, setbacks, and a lot of mud on the way. eventually they make it there, attempt to rescue Nick, and lose the Hemispheres (Orannis) to Hedge. <BR>In time, Lirael fully realizes the ramifications and consequences of Orannis gaining freedom, and discovers how to re-bind him, using her talent as a Remambrancer. <BR>All the main charachters of the previous few books are reunited in an effort to re-bind Orranis that is a repeat of history. I'll let you decide whether or not they succeed, but it was extremely cool to read. <BR>For those of you who've read this book and are reading this to see what other people think (as I usually do) - i liked it alot. but the hand - thing at the end was gross.  ...other than being creeped out in the last chapter or so, this was an awesome book! can't reccomend it highly enough! (but too short!)
0767830555|5.0|For me this movie is good, because it showed me that I am not allow. Yes, if you didnt live alone for yourself for a long time, dont reflect on how... well how frustrating life is, especially for young lonely man it is kind of hard to understand it. If you have family and friends you never get into that mood. But if you live all by yourself for weeks, months or years you may understand that. My feelings go upside down, sometimes I work very hard and have a \\"normal\\" life. The other day, I lay at home or walk or drive. But it is more than this \\"feeling alone in a crowd\\"-stuff. Thoughts come to your mind about the world, life, whatever in a very unusual way. It is really difficult to expresse it.<BR>Look at the docu about the movie, especially the parts where they talk abour DeNiros character and how they wrote the script.<BR>Than you may get, what Taxidriver is really about, but you have to be a Taxidriver to know what it is to be one of use.<BR>For the \\"hero\\"-thing. HE IS NO HERO. Only public opinion in the movie make him that. The movie doesnt want to say he is a hero. <BR>Then if you are like a Taxidriver you go with a girl to adult-movie without thinking, because you are still in your one world and stuff. You think, I must go out with her, but all what your mind comes up with is the adult-cinema because you go there all the time. <BR>Well whatever, FOR ME IT IS A GREAT HELP to feel better and go get that I am not the one person God or however wanted to judge. I dont know what other people see it it...
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Heartwarming studio chickflick about Hugh Grant bonding with a little boy...this description didn't send me rushing to the cinema, despite the Nick Hornsby brand. But shockingly, About a Boy isn't a standard Hollywood prefab romcom or sentimental twaddle -- it's an actual film, sharply written, evocatively directed, beautifully acted.<br />The caustic British wit immediately sets the film apart from its studio comedy brethren -- its actually, frequently funny. The characters feel real, lived in. The superb dual voiceover is potent rebuke to those still peddling the convential wisdom that vo's are &quot;uncinematic&quot; (if this includes you you're immediately assigned &quot;Election&quot; and &quot;Adaptation&quot;), working comfortably inside our protagonists' heads without any dreaded 'literary' staining, bringing their vibrant inner lives to comic life.<br />So instead of the false life lessons and maudlin sentimentality films of this sort so often trade in, we get a moving, witty story about...okay, yeah...Hugh Grant bonding with a little boy. But that's no reason not to rent it.<br />The widescreen picture is gorgeous (another nice departure from drearily filmed studio comedies) and the disc comes with numerous, lengthy deleted scenes that are virtually all terrific, and well worth viewing.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This movie has just moved onto my all time favorite list.  The plot is unique, touching, interesting and never gets boring.<br />While I am not a major Hugh Grant fan, I think that he is endearing, and  real, in this film.  As a 38 year old bachelor, it is clear that \\"island living\\" has isolated him from almost all the love and meaning that life has to offer.  (Think, \\"no man is an island.\\")  Through the course of the movie, he becomes entwined in the lives of others, and he finally finds that life on a (deserted) island may be a little lonely after all.<br />The supporting cast, as in many British movies, are very real and provide depth and interest to the film.  Marcus and his mother are both delightfully complex.<br />Great characters, insightful story, no violence, no slapstick, no gratuitous sex, and plenty of quirky plot devices all contribute to make this a new favorite.
0884271536|3.0|Surpisingly, few of the reviews here touch on the quality of the writing in Critical Chain.  In The Goal, Goldratt had the help of Jeff Cox to write a book that was not only instructive, but a pleasure to read as well.  Apparently Goldratt decided to write this book on his own, and overall it suffers for it.  It reads like a first draft in need of a significant rewrite, and Goldratt's editor did not do a very good job of editing.  The point of view shifts frequently, the sentences are overly wordy, and he commits the cardinal sin of writing -- he doesn't show, he tell's.<br />The book accomplishes its goal of applying the Theory of Constraints to Project Management, it's just very sloppy in the execution of that goal.  Perhaps its saving grace is that it is a very quick read.
0316666343|5.0|This is a most amazing book, for it manages to tell seamlessly tell the story of many disparate people who are all affected deeply by the murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon. Salmon narrates from \\"her\\" heaven (which Sebold is careful to differentite from any else's idea of heaven). Because of this creative device, the author can see into any mind and any life. This omnisicent viewpoint--once popular, but now out of favor--truly makes the book vibrate with feeling.<br />The characters are beautifully drawn and their reactions believeable. The writing, especially the descriptions of Susie's heaven is so lush and sweet. Susie is never bitter, never vindictive, never judgmental, just an impartial observer on what was too short of a life.<br />Some people feel the description of Susie's death is too grisly, but I found it sensibly succinct, without any lingering on gore or depravity. In fact, I doubt I've ever seen this subject handled better.<br />Tiny gripes: the bad guy is dispatched too cleanly, the cops are way too bungling to be believed, and there are some editing glitches when seasons get mixed up. Certainly none of these are enough to ruin the reading experience.<br />This is a true treat for any reader.
B000002IMG|5.0|I saw this band with Rob Halford back on the 14th of february... They are currently number 4 on my top 5 bands list...P>These guys should have gotten MUCH more recognition. Seriously, I think they're better than metallica and ALMOST as good as slayer.<br />Chuck Billy is an awesome frontman, one of metal's finest. He reminds me of James Hetfield with more range, and he has an amazing stage presence. Eric Peterson is a solid rhythm guitarist, and is very underrated. Maybe it's because he was playing with a guitar god known as Alex Skolnick...  Very few metal guitarists can play like this guy. Hammet, King, Hanneman, Hetfield, Spitz: forget it: Alex shreds them all. Just listen to the intro to \\"The New Order\\", or the heavy riff to \\"Disciples of the Watch\\"(my favorite testament song), or the Instrumental \\"Musical Death: A Dirge\\". The New Order in particular. Not to say the rest of the song isn't killer, cause it is, but the intro definately stands out as the best part of the whole song. Trial By Fire is another classic. The chorus is catchy, but this doesn't take away from the song's heaviness. The Preacher is also great, especially where Chuck screams \\"THE PREACHER!!!\\". Onto the instrumental. This is definately my favorite instrumental ever. you can just feel the heart and emotion in the soloing. Especially on the 3rd solo by Alex, 2:54 into the song. Eric Peterson also gets to show off his talents, as he plays the 2nd solo. These 2 were really amazing together... Buy this, not a single weak track, and it's heavy all the way through with amazing guitar work.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u.'s English debut album, 200 KM/H in the Wrong Lane is a must buy for any fan of pop music.  The entire cd is full of infectuous melodies, while at the same time, provides a very great message about not being afraid to be who you are.  These girls have a lot of talent and this is easily seen in their first single, \\"All the Things She Said,\\" which has reached the #1 spot in many countries all over the world.  This song is just a sample of the great songs on the cd.  Malchik Gay is an excellent song with great bass lines and guitar melodies with the girls intoxicating voices.  The next single to be released, \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" is truly a highlight, with its dance beat and techno-pop influence, it is sure to become a big hit.  There is really no 'bad' song on the album.  t.A.T.u. proves that you can be a pop singer and still send out an important message.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Personally I liked that film - especially the soundtrack. A film is of course not a history lesson. Still I don't see the harm if the producers had cared to stay closer to the circumstantial facts. Armory and clothing came close enough, except for crossbows, the Alsacean breed of the dog  and the cell phone an extra had dropped in the second part. Especially Lucilla's haute couture came straight from wall paintings in Pompeii. <br />It looks good on the screen to see the Roman infantry trot up to their enemies in close formation and take cover behind their shields when the barbarians fired a volley of arrows. However that's not how it was done in those days. The Roman legioner was not a Greek hoplite who held formation with shields locked. The Roman infantry man had three paces of open space to his neighbors left and right, giving room for his moves. The second rank spread accordingly covering the gaps behind the first rank etc. <br />So instead of losing momentum and stop to receive the arrows and take the full shock of the opponent's onrush the Roman legion would pick up the pace, discharge their \\"pilum\\" - the spear or javelin- and go straight for the kill. A legioner coming at you would do exactly the same move, Shaka used to teach his Zulu warriors 1,500 years later: a sweeping move with the shield would deflect the opponents defense and the sword or assagai would go straight for the kill in one decisive stab into the undefended side. <br />Both, Shaka and the Romans kept the blade deliberately short, so that the fighter had to go on close quarter - which actually is an advantage because it leaves the opponent fewer options for fancy moves. Perhaps Hollywood is thinking that this industrial killing technique doesn't make good film-copy? In Shaka Zulu's case it was still effective enough to annihilate a complete British brigade fully equipped with Springfield rifles and field artillery. <br />The main thing of course are the gladiatorial combat scenes. In the film it is very simple: every gladiator is a slave (or convicted criminal), every encounter a fight to the death. Not so in ancient Rome: many gladiators were actually free born people from all walks of life - in one instance even an emperor - who had chosen the arena as a career. But like the professional boxers in modern times, or the Japanese sumo wrestlers, a fully trained gladiator was obliged to enlist in the stable of a licensed impresario. <br />Not every fight was a mortal combat. In fact far less than 30% of all combats ended with a kill. Gladiators fought for money, even slaves received a purse. (Slavery in antiquity didn't mean loss of wages: an enslaved mason received the same minimum wages as his free colleague, the difference being that the slave's owner took out his cut.) There were contract rates for different kinds of performance; comparably low for feigned combats to show off the combatants skills in good clean entertainment at, say, weddings and funerals. Only an extremely rich patron could actually afford to pay the rates for mortal encounters. <br />Historians also like to quibble at Proximo's accusation that Marcus Aurelius had shut down the arenas, apparently for humanitarian reasons. The truth here is that Marcus Aurelius, a civilian to boot, was forced to fend off an invasion from Persia. His generals performed brilliantly and even invaded Iraqi territory. But among the trophies they also brought back the small pox. The epidemic ravaged the Empire for a whole 15 years and reduced the army to a mere skeleton force, of which every hostile tribe from across the border took due notice. So the civilian Marcus Aurelius suddenly found himself confronted with the task to rebuild the army practically from scratch and to wage war on the intruders. He partly accomplished this by drafting all the gladiators, whether free or slave, from all over the empire. So the arenas closed for lack of fighters. So far I see no reason why the film could not have reflected these facts more faithfully. <br />That the emperor was assassinated is Hollywood's favorite myth. There is no evidence for a plot on his life. As a matter of fact - but this would of course spoil the story - Commodus was already co-emperor for six years before Marcus Aurelius died in the camp of exhaustion and disease. This was the whole idea: one Caesar at home and one in the field, so that the surviver would guarantee continuity. Commodus continued to reign without causing complaints for another six years, and only changed to the worse after a failed plot on his life. From then on his eccentricities ruined his reputation and he died in 192 from a mysterious \\"accident\\" in the gym.
B00003CXA6|5.0|How many times have you read a book and loved it, that you go to see the movie and love it as well? Not often, generally when a book catches your heart and mind, you hate the film. To Kill a Mockingbird comes to mind as being one that is superb in both formats. I so love Harper Lee's book, yet the film version catches my heart in the same way. Gettysburg gets on that short list.<br />Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize Winning \\"Killer Angels\\" took the pivotal 3-day battle of the Civil War - Gettysburg - and gave you the pathos, the sheer frustration, the anger of a battle that slaughter so many. He gave you Lee, who did not want to fight there, a General who time and again defied all battlefield codes of do not divide your forces in the face of the enemy, who proved a defencive army could defeat a superior offence thrust. He was forced to fight where he did not want - in an offencive battle (same mistake that cost William Wallace Falkirk!). For the first time, Lee was forced fight with the loss of Jackson; with Stuart bent of rubbing the face of his father-in-law and the whole union army in the fact he could right around them, leaving Lee open with no screening, no intelligence as to where the Union army was; to one general who could not follow his orders; to Longstreet 'his old warhorse' who followed them to the letter sending men into a suicidal charge knowing he was sending them to their death. <br />Martin Sheen brings this Lee alive, so it's amazing to learn he was the 4th choice for the role. Tom Berringer is brilliant as Longstreet, with wonderful performances by Sam Elliot a Brig. Gen. John Buford, Jeff Daniels as Col Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the mesmerising Kevin Conway as Sgt. 'Buster' Kilrain his long suffering aid, John Diehl (Miami Vice) giving the impassioned speech as representatives of Maine soldiers who just want to go home, William Morgan Sheppard as Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, pleading for reason in the insanity, Stephen Lang (Manhunter) as the flamboyant Pickett and most especially, the dying Richard Jordon as Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead. His speech to Longstreet is just so painful on two levels. I have always loved Jordon's work, watching him from being introduced in films to this his final role. He was a brilliant actor who died way too young, one I so miss, and his genius shines in his final hour, just as it was Armistead's final hour. It just does not get any more poignant than that. <br />Also, there are neat cameos of Ken Burns as Hancock's aid and Ted Turner (the film's money-bank)as Col. Waller T. Patton (uncredited).<br />Please note: Gods and General is the prequel to this, written by Shaara's son Jeff. Ronald F. Maxwell is the director of both films, with Jeff Daniels reprising his role as Chamberlain, as well are C. Thomas Howell as his \\"don't call me Lawrence\\" brother and Kevin Conway as his Sergeant. Stephan Lang is in this film as well, but not as Pickett, but playing Stonewall Jackson - Bill Campbell will play Pickett. Robert Duvall, the incomparable, takes over as Lee (wonder which he was 1,2 or 3 choice for Gettysburg??) and Bruce Boxleitner (????) is now playing Longstreet (I shall withhold opinions on that casting change).<br />In this wide-screen format, you get the full experience. Stunning realisation of Shaara's masterpiece.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This DVD is the reason that people like me buy DVDs.  There a re a lot of extras that give you insight into the film making process.  You learn little tidbits that you would never have learned, and it doesn't hurt that the movie itself is fantastic!
B000002JSP|5.0|This record is probably the least appreciated album Led Zeppelin ever made, but I find it to be one of their strongest and most varied albums.  Stereo Review gave this album a &quot;recording of special merit&quot; because of its very ambitious embracing of various styles.  &quot;In the Evening&quot; opens the album with a classic riff much in the vein of &quot;Custard Pie&quot; or &quot;trampLED Under Foot&quot;.<BR>&quot;Southbound Suarez&quot; is a piano-based rocker that reminds me of Elton John's &quot;Rock of the Westies.&quot;  Page seems to step back on this album, letting much of the attention center on John Paul Jones.  &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; has a terrific drum solo, and was a left-field hit -- it's not heavy metal. It wouldn't be out of place on a mid-seventies Elton John album either.  &quot;Hot Dog&quot; is a rockabilly track, almost a throwaway, but its sprightliness and hammy performace by Plant make it a pleasure to listen to everytime.  <BR>     &quot;Carouselambra&quot; is a trance-rock piece, based on a very simple keyboard riff by Jones.  It really doesn't figure to be a success, but the excellent production by Page and the spaced out feeling make even this ten minute monster work.  It's quite in the same vein as &quot;In the Light&quot; from Physical Graffiti.  &quot;All my Love&quot; is a tender ballad, and should have been a hit.  Anyway, it got alot of FM exposure.  The synthesized strings really put this song in the realms of the winners.  Unfortunately, the last track, &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl,&quot; peters out with a blues reminicent of &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; or &quot;Tea for One&quot;, without the memorable guitar solos.  It's over produced, too. <BR>     This album has so many moods, textures, and variances, as well as showcasing all four members of Zep, that it just doesn't make sense to regulate this album as the weakest of their catalog.  It certainly is much better than &quot;Presence.&quot;  That album was so lacking in variation that I challenge most Zeppelin fans to tell the difference between &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; and &quot;Hots on for Nowhere.&quot;  It's quite a match for &quot;Physical Graffiti,&quot; except that it's got far less filler.  As I say, most Zeppelin fans don't like this album, but if you're into Led Zeppelin as a top 40 band, this album is for you.
B000075BFK|3.0|2pac's new record? Why does that sound so really strange? The man been dead for almost complete 7 years now, and is still making plantuim hits off unreleased material (or is really \\"unreleased?\\"...)<BR>That right there is prove and an engraved fact, that 2pac IS the best rapper to ever touch a mic. Period. ... Still livin' through wires and speakers.<br />The reason I gave this album 3 stars is quite simple. I hate the beats. Songs like \\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\" have intence lyrics, but with a simple 1, 2 snare, easy bassline, with few effects. Whats that all about? I was expecting another \\"Hit Em Up\\" type beat, with ferious 'Pac lyrics and disses. Perhaps its my fault for expecting to much from a dead man (or is he?...)<br />There are few other beats on this album that just sound to modern. I say that like its a bad thing, because it is a bad thing. One thing that drew me to Pac way back in the day was his \\"Thuggish\\" like beats, like \\"2 of Amerikaz Most wanted\\" or \\"Troublesome 96\\" \\"Bomb First\\"<br />'Military Minds' is once again, strong lyrics, but the beat just doesn't fit Pac. It's a nice beat, but it just doesn't fit the subject about what hes talking about.<br />Some beats on here are really nice fitting, like \\"There U Go\\" is a relaxed beat. \\"Still Ballin\\" is the best beat on the entire CD in my opinion. Trick daddy does an awesome job as well. BTW - Its strange 2pac's says Trick's name in the song...<br />The Intro really sets the CD off, I love the reporter and the rain and storm effects in the background. It's quite intence. Leaves some goose bumps on your arms.<br />\\"Never Be Peace\\" is funky, but once again - The beat just isn't \\"Pacish\\".<br />Overall - Avid Pac listeners will understand, and be happy with the album. But new Pac listeners should really start with the Greatest Hits album - A collection of the best Pac songs, ever. Then move on To 7 day theory, if you want some dark lyrics, with murderess beats. \\"All Eyez on Me\\" is of course, mostly car music, window down perferably.<br />I love Pac. ...
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent comes through with a solid debut album, but don't dare compare it to Nas's Illmatic or Jigga's Reasonable Doubt.  A few tracks are just fillers.  Tracks 2-8 are solid bangers that get heavy rotation in my player.  But after that, the CD goes down until 21 Questions and Don't Push Me, which end the album very well.  &quot;If David can go against Goliath with a stone, I can go at Nas and Jigga both for the throne.&quot;  Sorry, but 50 is not up to par with Jigga and definantly no where near Nas.  For now, he'll have to settle for third in NYC.
B000059GEH|5.0|And so we follow the escapades of three models as they take a luxury apartment together in the hopes of snaring a rich husband in this delightful comedy starring Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, and then-newcomer Marilyn Monroe.<br />Bacall is the ringleader, the level-headed woman who seems as tough as nails. Seems she got burned once years before with a poor guy, and she's not letting that happen again, no siree. The other ladies, Grable and Monroe, don't have quite her hard-nosed ambition, so there's lots to laugh at as Grable digs more working class fellas and near-sighted but not wearing her glasses Monroe can never quite tell who she's talking to. All three women have great wardrobes and as they're models in the storyline, there's even an opportunity to have a mini-fashion show with ensembles that otherwise wouldn't fit into the plot. <br />The supporting cast is solid too, with exceptional work from the married man who thinks he can have an illicit liaison with Grable, and the always wonderful William Powell as the silver fox older man Bacall is trying to lasso for herself, stubbornly refusing the advances of loutish seeming Cameron Mitchell. Of course, if I were in this movie, I wouldn't have to convince myself to go with Powell! But I guess I'll have to console myself with the millionaires in my own life instead. David Wayne does one of his better jobs as a four-eyed millionaire on the lam who finds himself sitting next to Monroe on a plane bound for -- but that's part of the gag!   <br />I really enjoy myself every time I watch &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; as every gal winds up following her heart anyway to a satisfactory conclusion. It's certainly &quot;How to&quot; have a good time with the telly tonight!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first listened to their music, it was on the advice of a good friend of mine. I love techno music, with its raunchy undertones and fast beats. And when I heard that this band was not only techno, but lesbian, I rushed to listen to them. I was immediately hooked. But was saddened when I also learned that many people (mostly men) were bashing the idea that these two girls were actually lesbian. I understand that most people (mostly men) cann't accept that a woman would have no use for them, and especially when that girl is so young. But I don't recall so much bad mouthing when the openly lesbian group fem2fem first came on the tecno scene. These women, with their adult sound and seductive videos, were welcomed by the majority, lesbian and men alike. So, it leaves me to believe that most people (mostly men) cannot truly phathom that a girl, at any age before 24, could possibly know what they want if they come to realization that they are in fact homosexual. These girls have given a positive voice to the millions of teenage homosexuals in the world, and by bad mouthing them and constantly questioning their true sexuality (which doesn't really matter anyway), the big picture has once again been lost. These girls are the voice of a new generation of homosexual teenagers who find themselves lost in the endless shuffle of what is expected to be \\"normal.\\" I say, Good For These Girls who are saying what so many teenage homosexuals cannot say to anyone, not even the people who gave them life. Does it really matter if they are truly lesbian or not? Or should people (mostly men) concentrate on the fact that they are helping people? Think about it!
B00005JKCH|1.0|If The Green Goblin is so interested in who Spider-Man is, why doesn't he take off Spider-Man's mask when he is unconcious with him on the rooftop?  Possibly because he is stupid.  And very lame.  The only good thing about this movie is when Kirsten DUnst is wet.  Cause she's fiiiiiiiiine.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|'Thriller' has sold 26 million copies in the US and 47 million worldwide. It also spawned 7 Top 10 hits but this isn't necessarily why this album is so great. <br />This album is a classic not because it sold so many copies and had so many hit singles though. If the songs were not hit singles, they still would be classics. It's about the music on this CD, first and foremost, nothing else. <br />Thriller was revolutionary in its time. The sounds and styles incoporated on this album were new at the time, a time of dying disco and underground punk. Thriller succeded in it's ability to trancsend racial barriers. The ability to transcend racial boundaries. Thriller was not only huge with whites and african americans, it was popular all around the world. One of the first true international successes. <br />There's pop, rock, r & b and dance rhythms; slow, fast and midtempo songs. <br />'Wanna Be Startin' Something' gets the album moving. It's a disco inferno and builds up to a chanting crescendo. The next two songs slow things down after the frenzied opening. <br />'Baby Be Mine' is a nice mid-tempo song. <br />'The Girl Is Mine' is the superstar duet with Paul McCartney. The song shows off both artists' vocal talents as they trade verses fighting over a girl's affection. You can almost see the song as a passing of the torch from the Beatles to Jackson as the world's biggest act. <br />The humorous 'Thriller' follows and it contains Vincent Price's debut as a rapper. <br />'Beat It' is the song that pushed the album into the cultural phenomenon that it was. By employing guitar god Eddie Van Halen on the song, Jackson was able to break out of the mold of an R & B artist and reach a vast white audience. Jackson showed he was able to transcend all labels and reach listeners of all colors and musical tastes. <br />'Billie Jean', the first number one song on the album follows and was shown on the Motown 25th anniversary special that helped show Jackson's amazing dancing abilities and push album sales through the roof. It was also the first video by a black artist to gain major airplay on the predominately white MTV, setting the stage for other black artists like Prince to start reaching a more diverse audience. <br />'Human Nature' is a pretty ballad and 'P.Y.T.' has more of a hard edge. His sister Janet sings back up on the tune. <br />The album closes with another ballad 'The Lady In My Life'. 'The Lady In My Life' is probably Michael's greatest love song. His voice on this one is pure vocal beauty. A great song for a great artist born in a great time in music. <br />So if you don't already have Thriller, buy it because of the music, not because of the fanfare that goes with it. <br />An absolute classic.
6305910103|5.0|So, round two of my quest to watch all of the Star Trek movies in order from the beginning:  The Wrath of Khan.  Often touted as the best of the ST movies, Star Trek II involves the villainous Khan (ruthlessly portrayed by Ricardo Montalban), a criminal, genetically-advanced human, exiled to a barren planet forever...until now.  <br />By chance, Federation ship Reliant unknowingly explores the planet on which he is held captive, and Khan's visitors soon find themselves trapped...coerced to serve his evil deeds under the influence of an indigenous brain parasite.  Of course, Khan's plan is to find his original captor (Captain turned Admiral James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner) and avenge the death of his wife as well as his exile to a dead planet.    <br />The movie follows Khan's pursuit of Kirk and escalates to a battle of proportions only Star Trek could deliver.  Montalban gives an excellent performance of Khan, although his psychotic vengeance too often seems to override his allegedly \\"superior intellect.\\"  Making her movie debut, Kirstie Alley (aka Rebecca Howe from tv's \\"Cheers\\") portrays the stoic \\"by the book\\" cadet Saavic....oddly enough, she makes a great Vulcan.  Although I hardly understand how her long flowing mane of brown hair could possibly pass Federation regulations (just watch the movie, you'll see what I mean).<br />As the ultimate blow to the film, Spock comes to his ultimate demise in this movie.  However, those familiar with the entire series of movies will know that this is indeed not the end (vis a vis ST III:  The Search for Spock), and that the dramatic send-off of his character in Wrath of Khan is one of the most poignant (and controversial) in ST history.<br />To sum it up, ST II is great fun!  Even if you're a Star Trek peon like me, you'll find it quite entertaining!  :)
B00003CXXM|2.0|Fans of Robert Ludlum please avoid this movie.  The movie adaptation takes extreme liberties with the novel.  In the novel, Jason Bourne was an identity created by the US intelligence community in a counter mission to entrap the world's most notorious assassin, Carlos the Jackal.  After Jason is shot and found floating in the Mediterranian, Jason Bourne can only slowly recall pieces of that knowledge and we the reader don't know the whole story either.  What made the novel so exciting was the discovery process which we undergo with Jason.  We learn about his language skills, weapons training, and martial arts ability.  Is he a killer or at least a very dangerous man?  As Jason tries to piece together his memory, Jason forces Marie into helping him elude his pursuers.  Can she trust him when he says he won't hurt her?  It would seem inconsistent with his ruthlessness and training?  The tension present in the book was sorely missing in the movie.  In summary, the movie replaces this masterwork with a relatively simplistic tale of a CIA assassin with amnesia running \\"off the reservation\\" and creating a potentially embarrassing international incident that needs to be cleaned up.    <br />By the way, the \\"alternate\\" ending is nothing but a teaser to sucker fans of the movie/novel to rent or worse buy this DVD.  I am offering no spoilers in saying that the \\"alternate\\" ending only differs slightly from the original ending.  The major improvement is the lack of corny dialogue which is replaced mostly by kissing.
B00005MP58|5.0|There is an absolutely hilarious scene about an hour or so into the series.  The bennett family is at a village gathering. The whole family (except Jane) has by turns rendered Elizabeth speechless with embarrassment--in front of the ever proud Mr Darcy.  <br />The youngest daughter has lambasted the assembly with a musical performance to rival the worst Idol's Simon has endured. The middle sisters have invented a new level of crassness to the art of flirting.  Mr Collins, the ever unctuous, has committed a horrendous faux pas - a scene that makes one realize what a great actor Colin Firth is, how DID he manage to keep a straight face.  And to top it off Mr Collins is about to threaten the company with a musical encore to rival the youngest sister's now infamous performance, when the eldest Bingley sister rushes up to the piano and furiously plays a Mozart sonata.<br />Ever into the breach, the magic of Mozart.<br />This movie/series has it all.  Austen authenticity, riots of laughter, unmatched social commentary by way of brilliantly witty dialogue (all of it direct from the original writer's lips), great performances, and at its heart the best love story ever.  Best casting of leads in recent memory.
0062502182|4.0|This book is a good read for teenagers. I read it when I was one, and was very inspired. More recently I reread it, and found it nothing special. I think the story is very simplistic, the development of characters not very deep, even when it comes to the main character. It is a good book as a pastime, or even to deliver the message (chase your dreams).
B000063CMK|3.0|This album shows quite a bit of potential, and it it obvious that Pain of Salvation are a talented band.  I'll try to weigh out some of the positives and negatives.<br />On the plus side, there is definitely some great music here.  The guitar and piano/keyboard interplay is very good on several of the tracks.  The drum and bass work are consistently effective.  Also, even though the singing varies widely, it is usually pretty good.  <br />However, there are a few negatives that keep this album from being the &quot;brilliant masterpiece&quot; that some misguided fans apparantly think it is.  First of all, the widely varying singing is occasionally poor.  Second, the band really doesn't display that much technical skill.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this - but Pain of Salvation bills themelves as a prog-metal band, and to be a band of that genre, you have to show some chops.  I don't think Pain of Salvation is quite up to the task.  I felt they placed far too much emphasis on a mediocre story-line.  Also, the time signature changes on &quot;Rope End&quot; are very choppy and awkward, and the singing on &quot;Fandango&quot; doesn't match the music at times.  Furthermore, the ballad called &quot;This Heart of Mine&quot; is downright poor.  These mistakes may be excusable for a new band, but Pain of Salvation have been around for several years.<br />Overall, this is a good, solid album from Pain of Salvation.  But it falls short in a couple of areas and gets 3 stars as a result.
0385503954|4.0|Our book club decided to take on British dramatist Ian McEwan, representing a departure from our normal servings of mystery and thriller best sellers. \\"Atonement\\" is the author's eleventh book, including two of short stories and eight novels, all penned over the last two decades or so. We're treated to a three-part story: half the book describes a scene set in a 1930's English mansion in which 13-year-old Briony, an aspiring writer who lives mentally in her own fantasies much of the time, witnesses first a sexual encounter between her older sister Cecilia and essentially a foster son, gardener Robbie, both recent college grads, and later that same day, the rape of her cousin Lola. She is convinced in her own mind that the perpetrator was Robbie and largely on her unflagging testimony, he goes to prison. Much of the story is told through little more than mental meanderings, whole sections without dialogue but just one character's inner thoughts. No doubt this technique is what has earned the author his repute for intimate characterization.<br />In the second shorter part, Robbie has gone off to war (WW-II) and is part of the British retreat to and rescue at Dunkirk. The imagery of this section was so vivid, it was almost like a movie unreeling in the reader's mind, attesting to McEwan's gift for descriptive, evocative prose. Finally in the last section, Briony is grown up and a wartime nurse trainee. A brief encounter with Cecilia and Robbie, reunited lovers, discusses her desire to recant her misguided testimony and help clear Robbie's name. In a somewhat remarkable epilogue, it is revealed she spends the rest of her life writing about her guilt and regret, naming the real culprit in a book to be published after the deaths of the players.<br />At first we found this tale a little tedious, even dull. Yet we had the {correct} feeling we waited on the verge of a big event, after which the story line did not disappoint, and we started turning pages considerably faster. We have here a true drama, where characters and their thoughts and emotions are more important than in a melodrama where actions and deeds tend to take precedence. McEwan has much to say about life, relationships, and truth and consequences. He has the craft to not merely entertain, but to provoke reflection and incite thought. Scary!We have here a true drama, where characters and their thoughts and emotions are more important than in a melodrama where actions and deeds tend to take precedence. McEwan has much to say about life, relationships, and truth and consequences. He has the craft to not merely entertain, but to provoke reflection and incite thought. Scary!
B00005JLRR|2.0|THe trouble with this movie is that it seem to be run in auto-pilot. It looks more like an TV episode with extra-budget than a real feature film. I liked INSURRECTION much more.<br />Of course, we´re dealing here with charismatic characters that we all love, so we tend to be kind to the movie flaws. And there are not many. THe plo, altough its resemblanc with THE WRATH OF KHAN, is good. The acting is fair. It´s just the \\"feeling\\" that is not right, I can not explain it properly... Something is wrong here...
B000002GQJ|4.0|i've been listening to the lp version...don't know how it sounds on cd. but i think this album was well done. if you think the album ..., atleast the vocals are good, justin has a great voice. considering i usually listen to bands like misfits, that shows you something about the quality of the album.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is a very unique book.  Mersault, the main character, is an amoral person, who floats through life as things seem to happen to him without plan or purpose.  He eventually commits a murder, in a manner that it is not clear why.<br />To me, it was a tale about sense and judgment.  The author created a microcosm, inside the character, of what the world would be like if there were no morals.  The bonds existing between human beings are removed, and all that is left is an empty and unemotional person.<br />I highly recommend it, as a picture of where the world would be if we removed the shared experiences of humans.
B00005JLXC|5.0|When i first saw a preview for daredevil i thought it was just like any other superhero story, and then when it came out and some of the critics didnt like it, i was like oh jeez this is going to be a bad movie, but i was mistakin. When i saw daredevil a couple of nights ago i was totally shocked at how great of a movie it is. its got a wonderful story line, and it really makes you think of how hard it would be to be blind. i am so happy i went to see daredevil and i cant wait for it to come out on video, because it is one of my most favorite movies of all time!
0679746048|5.0|I read this book 3 times within the last 2 years. It takes you into a new world. You can invision the place in which she stays. The descriptions are wonderfull.

B00003CXA6|4.0|In a time when most war movies seem to have to throw in the requisite love story or use fiction, its refreshing to see a movie that could double as a documentary.<BR>Many people were turned off by the length of the movie, but I wasn't.  In fact, the movie probably could have been longer especially as they went into some of the tatical discussions.<BR>The acting in this movie was top notch, although I was a little put off by some of the fake beards, but oh well.  The battle scenes in this movie were very intriguing, especially the Pickett's Charge scene.  The speech before hand was pretty cool as it highlights what makes people go to war.<BR>However the best part of the movie was the portrayal by Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain.  He played the citizen-soldier to a T.  Watching him, I could somehow imagine the person who was thrust into a role that he wasn't really comfortable doing.  He did the reluctant warrior really well.  When he gave the orders to affix bayonets, chills went down my spine.<BR>Having said this, I can't wait for Gods and Generals.
0151008116|5.0|Judging by the many reviews I've read of this book, it's an almost irresistable temptation to plumb the metaphoric significance of its every passage. Although I enjoy reading books on multiple levels, my recommendation to prospective readers is to get this book and simply let it take you along for the ride. I found it at turns surprising, captivating, poignant and moving. I found Martel's writing here to be spare and graceful, so much so that the story flows practically seamlessly. The central story is sandwiched between a slowly developing prologue and a mercifully brief epilogue, and though I'm tempted to describe it as a cross between &quot;Calvin &amp; Hobbes&quot; and &quot;Castaway,&quot; I'd be doing it a disservice. For maximum reading pleasure I found I had to suspend my disbelief in the same way I did for books like &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; but this book is so hugely entertaining and satisfying, I did so naturally and willingly. This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. Don't miss it.
0060537639|3.0|The book 1421 provides a well supported, yet controversial, thesis that would only further the inaccuracies in many of the modern history books provided to the western public. Menzies provides maps, personal logs from European as well Asian explorers, DNA evidence, carbon dating from wrecks believed to be Chinese junks, and historical documents to support his claims that the Chinese were the first to circumnavigate and map the globe. Despite his overwhelming amounts of evidence, much of the book seems to leave out key facts and is, at best, moderately written.<br /> Menzies left out sizable amounts of the journeys described, and it is evident that he probably spent more time on the first chapters than the later chapters. He also has a tendency to write of stories and surroundings that have little or no significance in respect to the travels of the ancient Chinese. The writing style exhibited by Menzies in 1421 is lacking, often going off on tangents and skipping over certain facts and details that would have been very useful in proving his thesis.<br /> Also, due to Menzies' background his book will likely be declared unscholarly and be disregarded by the majority of scholars and professors as merely another outrageous theory. As for future releases of this book, it would likely be much more welcome if produced by a person with a highly respected historical background. Future editions would also be better received if published in five volumes; the first four dedicated to each of the four voyages, and the last of the five being an encyclopedia of the supporting evidence (with scans of the involved maps and documents).<br /> Overall the book provides more factual (and plausible) evidence as to how the Piri Reis and the Bimini Stones came to be than any other widely read western author to date and provides a well supported thesis.<br /> Menzies' 1421 has earned an eternal place in my personal collection and will be an entertaining read for any audience. Menzies shouldbe applauded for his rather controversial work.

B000066796|4.0|Being rather slow on the uptake, I did not see Kate and Leopold in theater and watched it on video for the first time a couple nights ago. I must confess I have never seen Meg Ryan in a film before, nor Liev Schreiber. I absolutely fell in love with Schreiber. His acting is superb. Meg Ryan, however, was disappointing. At times it was painfully honest that she was acting, and she looked bored. Yet another brainless blonde romantic part? However, Hugh Jackman as the Duke, Leopold, did a smashing job and helped change this film from yet another sappy romance into a story full of laughs and love and just a little bit more.<br />The idea of time travel, though intrical to the plot, wasn't delved into too deeply. Nor in this version of the film (non-bonus) was it revealed that Stuart (Kate's ex-boyfriend) and the Duke were related, thus many of the motivations weren't clearly explained. It would have helped if that bit of the plot had been left in, but still, the pretzel twisted idea of having to go back in time in order to move forward and so on was cute, if a bit hackneyed. As in every good romance, love ultimately triumphs and wedding bells ring.<br />Can I recommend this movie? If you like light, comic romances and aren't sick of Meg Ryan or time travel, definitely.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I went to see Chicago on Friday 2/14/03 and then again the next day and the day after that.  I cant seem to get this movie out of my head.  It's one the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.  First of all I felt like the movie was worth the 9 dollars I paid to see it.  Catherine is amazing in this movie, Renee is going to be the next Julia Roberts, she is going to blow up after this, and Richard was surprisingly good when it comes to the vocal department.  Queen Latifah was also amazing in the movie, although I felt one person could have played that part better, and that is Nell Carter, RIP, but Queen did great.  The music is amazing, considering I went to buy the soundtrack 10 min after seeing it on valentines day.  The dancing is amazing, the fianl number with Renee and Catherine floored me, and when the movie was over the people at the movie were clapping and cheering as if we were at the broadway show.  Roxie and Velma made you cheer for them. Anyone who went to see this and says it was'nt good, obviously has no idea of what a GREAT movie is.  I would go see it again and again.  When it comes out on DVD you know who will be first in line.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Although I thoroughly enjoyed CHICAGO the movie, I admit a strong preference for the Broadway version, which is far more intimate and raw than the cotton-candy color of Rob Marshall's debut film. Sure enough, the leads are superb - Renee Zellweger reafirms my belief that she is one of the great actresses of our time, while Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply BRILLIANT - surely an Oscar awaits her on March 23rd for her vivid portrayal of Velma Kelly. John C Reilly is a grand \\"Mr. Celophane\\" and THE Queen, Latifah, is a hoot at Mama, the prison warden. Richard Gere is just OK in a largely supporting role that never really gets under your skin - maybe that's why he was passed over by the Academy - his role has bite, but it's gums, not teeth that clamp down on you.<br />The musical zips and hums itself along as a half fantasy, half reality saga...a tale of desperate women driven to desperate acts by the nasty men who use and abuse them. And therein lies the problem. What the movie Chicago doesn't deliver, and the stage version does in spades, is a sense of intimacy...a motive that's more fully realized on stage because the audience is both witness to a crime, and a jury of peers to the irrepressible Roxie Hart. Movies of hit musicals rarely achieve the spectacle one feels on stage, and Chicago is better than MOST movie musicals to be sure. Still, it doesn't MOVE the audience because its two dimensional vision never makes you feel like anything but a movie-viewer. That may be enough for some, but it left this moviegoer - with Broadway down the street - tapping his feet, but never fully engaged. Anyone without the benefit of huge stage musicals at your doorstep would be wise to take a trip to the Windy City... it's that good a movie. The score is wonderful, the songs will keep you humming for days, and again, the performers are terrific, through and through. Yet - this CHICAGO can't hold a candle to the original Fosse stage show, and the movie never fully takes flight. <br />Finally, many folks are forcing comparisons between Chicago and last year's musical treasure, \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" In my opinion, the Baz Lurhman spectacle was a superior film, for the exect same reasons Chicago is a better stage event. Moulin was filled with unexpected pleasures - you never knew what would happen next even though the melodies and lyrics were familiar to us baby boomers. Where Moulin soared, Chicago just sizzles. And that's not a BAD thing, it's just less grand, less inspired and not quite as original.
0786868694|2.0|I obtained this book after being smitten with the Nigella Bites TV show, and am disappointing with book compared to on the on-air version. True, the book contains the recipes I've seen on TV. In fact, it reads like a printed version of the TV script, and nothing else. Rather than being filled with more in-depth information and additional recipes that didn't make in into the short time of an episode (as I would have hoped), the limited content of the book is padded in metallic-inked graphics, more like a &quot;coffee table book&quot; than a cookbook. Most of the recipes are special-occasion, junk-food-type items; this is not a good basic cookbook. Nigella's earlier cookbooks do appear from a quick look to be more substantial; perhaps one of them would have been a better choice.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Recorded in a beach house in Southern California, Morning View reflects the sandy shoreline and moving waters through its quiescent yet eloquent atmosphere. Whether labelled as a sellout or a step up in maturity, it is distinctively different from the previous albums. The sound is very harmonious through the significance of acoustics juxtaposed against layers of strings, making this a peaceful and insightful recording. Although Incubus is often portrayed as \\"just another MTV band\\" and associated with the \\"Nu-Metal\\" crowd, this album has proved that their emotions are genuine and their talents are real.<br />\\"Nice To Know You\\" is an effective introduction to Morning View as heavy riffs are blended evenly with softer melodies. \\"Circles\\" is a track which is reminiscent of old Incubus packed with lots of raw energy. However, the intensity of the songs fade out and is soon contradicted with the soothing acoustics of \\"11 a.m.\\", \\"Mexico\\", and \\"Echo\\". \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" exhibits utter most tranquility and inner peace through some oriental influences. This new approach indicates both sophistication and musical development on the part of the band. It drags out to 7 minutes, making it thought provoking and less commercial. However, the standout track is clearly \\"Warning\\". Brandon's vocals shine when distributed with outstanding lyrics and melodies. This song represents the climax of the album by emphasizing the overall theme to the audience.<br />Incubus is a band that is both underrated and often misrepresented by the media, being MTV. An extremely talented group of musicians with a gifted vocalist, they are capable of a very successful future. But there are some sections the band should try to improve on, espicially the lyrics. They are at times too simplistic and clash with the music. The choruses also tend to get repetitive frequently shown on \\"I Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Nice To Know You\\". Aside from that, they acquire what few bands have today; an important message, and a positive intuition towards life.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is probably one of the best cds i have ever bought!  The songs have awesome beats, and every single one of them talks about true life!  It's a great cd for adults and kids alike.
B00005JGAB|5.0|It's kind of hard to not like this album. I mean, it has all of the Ramones classics on it. Songs like \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\", \\"53RD & 3RD\\", \\"Loudmouth\\", \\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow The World\\", & \\"Beat On The Brat\\" are so original, & fun to listen to. This was an album that was done cheap, but the quality is price-less. Hey Ho, Let's Go!
1587990717|5.0|the tone of this immensely enjoyable book is neither arrogant nor bombasic. it is simply that the author is irreverent and does not respect rich businessmen to the extent he likes scientists and thinkers. also he tends to dislike people who takes themselves seriously, particularly media journalists.<BR>another point: taleb's book contradicts the tenets of &quot;against the gods&quot;. for taleb probability is qualitative and essentially non measurable. it is just a way of thinking, a way of being. nothing to do with any other book on randomness like dennet. <BR>i love this book
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I am the KING of movie renters, of the people I know.  I had seen all my local video store had to offer, except one movie - Donnie Darko.  I didn't know why this movie was always out whenever I came by, but my curiosity began to swell with every week that passed.  Finally one day, it was in, and I rented it.  I wasn't expecting much, since I had heard nothing about it, so I sat down and prepared myself for a visit to the land of mediocre.<br />I've never been so wrong.<br />This movie sucked me in from the very first frame...  The caliber of acting, script, direction, soundtrack, editing, casting, wardrobe... Everything!  The storyline is killer! I just love when you expect nothing and get it all!  This movie is my personal pick for best all around rental of last year.<br />As soon as I finished viewing the movie, I went to the bathroom, went to the kitchen and made a snack, put on my night clothes, and watched it AGAIN!  Donnie Darko is the kind of movie that you can realize something new every time you see it.  It truly is a BRILLIANT piece of cinema. I of course bought the DVD the very next day (thank you Amazon.com!), and have watched it a good 15 times since.  I've lent my copy to other friends, who have immediately gone out and gotten their own copy, and thanked me for hooking them up with such a fantastic movie.<br />This movie isn't a \\"must rent\\"  It's a \\"must own\\".<br />My hat is off to Drew Barrymoore and her production company. What a smart movie.<br />I'll end this review with a little piece of advice to anyone about to see this work of art:  Pay attention. Even when there's nothing going on, there's something going on.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I personally just LOVE this movie!  I mean I am a teenage, blonde girl who generally falls into what many people see as Elle.  But I know many people who are not blondes, or girls, or even teenagers who just loved this movie!  It's a movie that eveyone will enjoy!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This is the most amazing album to come out in a long time. It is the work of a genius. The lyrics are perfect and the melodies are beautiful. There isn't a single song to be skipped over. The album flows so well, starting with the post 9/11 anthem New York, New York and ending across the country with the perfect ending Goodnight Hollywood Blvd. The highlights of this album are Wildflowers, Firecracker, Sylvia Plath, and When the Stars Go Blue. This is the best album by Ryan Adams, and that, in my opinion, says a lot.
0385503954|4.0|Atonement is a complex, at times difficult, read and is not for everyone.  McEwan has an immense vocabulary and does not present the story the way the typical bestselling author does.  The reader must be very patient, but Atonement is well worth the read.
0316666343|1.0|This book is horrible.  It was a nice novel up until the last 10 pages or so and then it got really disurbing.  She was writing a sweet, funny, touching book and then it got perverted and weird.  The ending is not at all what it should have been --it leaves you feeling like you've watched kiddy porn.  Don't bother reading this book - left me feeling really uneasy and troubled.
B00000F566|5.0|See this movie! If you're anything like me(a hopeless romantic)you'll never be the same again!I've had it on video for ten years and watch it as often as I can.  I used to dance all throughout my childhood (tap, ballet, jazz, etc), but as soon as I saw this movie when I was 15, I switched to Latin-American dancing and it's been my profession ever since.The music and the love displayed in this movie really makes you want to get up and express yourself through dance. Patrick Swayze is a joy to watch.  Throughout my entire career I have never seen a man dance as well as him. Any woman or girl who hasn't seen this movie will fall in love with it instantly, but I also believe it is good for men to see this movie to get a taste of what women really want -not just a hunky guy, but a man who can show his true feelings.
0060934913|5.0|I recommened anyone who it going or thinking about going to culinary school to read this book.  Everything in this book is true and if your a chef you can identify with what he has to say. This book just scratches the surface on what goes on in the kitchen.  I just couldn't put this book down!
B00006ZSAD|4.0|Ahhhhh(sigh)! that's exactly what this album made me say when I first heard it. It made me feel all warm and snoozy. It's one of those rare albums that ALWAYS put you into a particular mood when you want it to, just like the Flamin' Lips latest release always puts me into a giddy stupor. If ever I'm feeling stressed or in a slightly irritant mood,then on it goes and I'm 'cured' instantly. Beware though, as I have not been able to put it on without listening to it the whole way through,resulting in ALOT of (well)spent time. If Portishead disband tomorrow, then maybe I won't be completely devastated, because miss Gibbons and her Rustin Man will know how to sooth my soul.
0800141660|5.0|Actors competing with one another - Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and even the youngest sister; Emma, the mature and sensible, Kate bubbling with romance, Hugh befitting to the situation and Alan, the silent lover and what not. Can there be so many good things in a movie? The movie, based on the classic novel by Jane Austen and beautifully screenplayed by Emma Thompson and directed by Ang Lee.<br />The story revolves around thee Dashwood sisters who were once rich and famous but losing all of them and searching towards their destiny. The Goddess of wealth or happiness does not seem to be on their way for long and even if, not lasting. The elder sister Elinor - the sensible - and loves Ferras; the younger Marianne is very romantic and attracted deeply to Willoughby when Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. However his love is known only by Elinor until Marianne comes to know finally.<br />If rich and perfect English locations, great costumes, superb and eloquent language, fine piece of acting are there to appreciate in the movie, Emma Thompson's great acting along with Screenplay adds further to it. <br />Great movie to watch! If you would like to possess the novel, you got to add the DVD also into your collection.
B00005ATQG|5.0|The three important themes in this movie that were emphasized were, one, respect the power of sex; two, respect for other people's feelings; three, with certain exceptions, no person is all bad (James Mason's character). A GREAT FILM, DEFINITELY WORTH DISCUSSING.
B000084T18|5.0|50's worth the hype he's been getting.  Get Rich or Die Trying is the best rap debute since Jigga's Reasonable doubt.  Although 50's lyrics are nothing new and his flow is only average, the album has fat beats and is true to the gangsta rap form.  This album has already gone platinum and will continue to be hot.  I strongly suggest you pick up this one cause it looks like the the crown jewel of '03.  For those non believers, this album reminds me of 'Pac.
B005NFJAT4|2.0|This review is specifically for the blu-ray transfer, not the film itself (which is just fine). On blu-ray, the film appears to be too dark, and even muddy, in some scenes. Most of the scenes do appear to be alright, visually, but I found a problem with roughly 25% of the scenes. As I mentioned, they're either too dark, and even blurry in some cases. The contrast between scenes with sunlight and scenes with little light is incredibly harsh. Even if you have all the lights turned off while watching this film, you'll still have a hard time making out details in the darker scenes.<br /><br />Visually, the film looks more dated than it should be. It was filmed in 1992 if I remember correctly, but it looks as if it were filmed in 1975, at least in some scenes! I would suggest that this film needs to be visually remastered and re-released in the future. The blu-ray quality did not meet my standards.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This is a TRUE PAC FAN CD. This is the best of his CD'S. Bomb First is the best intro. In the begining, you think you can hear softley \\"Suge Shot Me,\\" but no one will ever know what is being said. Hail Mary is a freaky song that sends a chill down your back, but it is one of the best Pac songs ever, and one of the best on the CD. To Live and Die in LA is a great song which is probably the mellowist on the CD. A great one for the African-Americans is White Manz world. 2Pac raps about being black and that it makes him proud to be black. But the 2 Best songs on this CD are number 10 and 11, Me and My Girlfriend, which Jay-Z later redid and attempted to make better. But he didn't He is slower and has Beyonce Knowles feat, which throws this whole song off. Pac's version is more rap and faster then Jay-Z's version. Lastly, number 11 Hold ya Head is a great song to listen to when you are feeling down. It shows 2Pac went through struggles and he is sick of them. This is my favorite 2Pac CD, and it is the best of the Pac CD'S. This is a must, you HAVE TO BUY THIS CD!
0151008116|4.0|The book jacket of Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, declares that it is a novel \\"that may, as one character claims, make you believe in God.\\"  Life of Pi tells the story of Piscine Molitor Patel, a young Indian boy who finds himself stranded in a lifeboat on the Pacific Ocean with an odd crew of companions, one of which is a tiger.  Martel's vivid and imaginative storytelling makes it so the reader experiences Pi's adventure with him:  the feelings of isolation being adrift on the Pacific Ocean, the overwhelming loss of being orphaned, the fierce competition for survival, and the overwhelming fear of what each new day may bring.  <BR>Although the way Martel ends the book leaves something to be desired(dredging up some minor characters to figure out the real life of pi), the book is a worthy read if just for Martel's vivid descriptions of life at sea and the book's spirit of adventure and survival.
B000002GC2|5.0|Even though this c/d is more than 10 years old, it still holds up as great listening. James Ingram is just totally soulful, and Quincy Jones is a genius.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Ok, so you have to hear the CD to get my reference to `Sam Hall...Sam Hall'.  Folks, I can add little else to what has been said here.  Cash has created another masterpiece, and further solidifies himself as an American Icon.  Personally, I love \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Hurt\\",  \\"The Man Comes Around\\" and of course, \\"Sam Hall\\".  Heck, I love em all.  Nuff said!
0380789019|4.0|A really fun book to read, exactly as it should be and completely compelling and spellbinding, with none of the credibility gaps this kind of story is prey to.  Just great fun!
B00005KAQP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies-- it's SO funny, and there are great songs that I can listen to over and over!<BR> A tacky casino singer witnesses a murder committed by a mob, and the police hide her away in a convent until they can set a trial date. She meets a bunch of nuns that each have their own individual personalities (something that makes this movie so much fun) and is instructed to join the AWFUL nun's choir by the strict Reverend Mother. Then she discovers that she can actually help the choir to be great, and that there is really a lot of talent in that group.<BR>If you haven't seen it, you're missing out! Go and rent it!<BR>Better yet, buy the DVD--that way you can watch the wonderful concert scenes over and over again through the magic of chapter selection--
B000002B2X|5.0|The first of two Ep's by alice in chains being 1994's \\"jar of flies\\" and 1992's \\"sap.\\" Both are exceptionaly good, but the crisp/muddy sometimes riffs of there studio meterial is of an absence on here. Except for track 2, \\"got me wrong\\" which may very well possibly be one of the most underrated alice in chains tunes in there carrer. The only problem with this is the recording quality, they could of turned up the guitars and the vocals just a tab bit more, but oh well I find that more to be part of the experience.<br />Only 4 songs, but 5 star tunes. Sap starts off with \\"brother\\" with it's highly rythmyic yet sorta erie type vocals from stayley. The only main base electic tune, \\"got me wrong\\" is one of the main reason why I bought this, almost as if a b-side to facelift. \\"right turn\\" is definetly a treat for grunge fans and AIC fans alike, features chris cornell of soundgarden and mark arm of mudhoney and hearing them all going on the vocals is pretty much musical bliss. The soft and somber \\"am I inside\\" is a apt closeing for sap, dark but good. While hidden track #5 is a little out of place, but I find it houmourous.
0151008116|3.0|A decent story, but not terribly innovative or original. Certainly not deserving of any major prizes or all the hype and adulation it has received, but worth reading for entertainment. And no, it will not change your life or make you find God. Like it was that easy.
B000063WDH|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM! it's hard for me to understand how the record industry has overlooked this recording.  while the nominees for the 2003 grammy awards is filled with unworthy candidates (ie brittany spears, nelly, nickelback.....)the black keys don't even get on the radio. The album is very blues infuenced but with a garage band touch.  It doesn't do the album any justice to explain what it sounds like, so if you like great rock music by this album now.
0792846443|5.0|Misery is an exceedingly good adaptation of the original novel by Stephen King.  The novel features one of King's most tightly-wound, increasingly suspenseful tales, and this movie faithfully brings the novel to life on the big screen.  Paul Sheldon, America's best selling writer, creator of Misery Chastain and chronicler of her romantic and human struggles and successes, has just finished writing a \\"serious\\" novel he hopes will give him the stature he desires.  On his trip home with the manuscript, a fierce blizzard causes him to lose control of his car.  Annie Wilkes, his number one fan, finds his car at the bottom of a hill, pulls Sheldon out of it, and takes him home to nurse back to health.  As Sheldon begins to adjust to his new surroundings, he is increasingly bothered by his caregiver's erratic mood swings.  He soon finds himself a virtual prisoner in her house, essentially unable to move with his two mangled legs.  When Annie reads his brand new book, she is exceedingly unhappy with it.  When she gets the newly published Misery Chastain novel and finds out that her beloved Misty is dead, she begins unleashing her fury on Sheldon and insisting he resurrect Misty in a new novel written especially for her.  All this time, the small mountain town's husband-and-wife police force search for any sign of the missing author (albeit halfheartedly).  Eventually, Sheldon realizes escape is something only he can achieve for himself.<br />James Caan is quite good as Paul Sheldon, but Kathy Bates simply is Annie Wilkes.  Her performance as this complicated, mentally disturbed super-fan broods over this entire movie, making it the riveting thriller it is.  Lauren Bacall, in what is an overlooked but rather amazing casting coup, lends her talents to the movie in the role of Sheldon's literary agent, while Richard Farnsworth and perennial King favorite Frances Sternhagen round out a truly excellent cast.  King actually held out on this project until such time as it could be placed in the more than capable hands of director Rob Reiner.  King had a special affection for this particular story, and he was not going to allow a second-rate adaptation of it to come to the big screen.<br />The suspense of this story is basically psychological in nature, but there are two scenes of far more physical suffering.  The hobbling scene is memorable to say the least, and another incident toward the end introduces a little blood to the film, but overall this is a movie that all lovers of suspense and human drama can appreciate.  There are a lot of bad movies based on terrific Stephen King stories and novels, but this movie captures the powerful magic of the original novel as effectively as any King movie ever has.placed in the more than capable hands of director Rob Reiner.

B0000636UN|5.0|There's a ton of so-called &quot;rock&quot; music being produced these days and I don't have time to spend listening to the radio to prospect for new music like I did when I was younger. As a result, I mostly listen to &quot;classic&quot; rock music from the '60's and '70's. I also complain a lot about the lack of quality contemporary rock. I haven't heard 95% of the contemporary rock available, so perhaps I shouldn't be so critical, but it is also true that I have, with few exceptions, been disappointed by the newer music I've tried. Bands like Oasis, Third Eye Blind, Blind Melon and the Goo Goo Dolls have been a letdown to me.<br />Over the last several years I had seen and heard Sheryl Crow, but had not been impressed enough to really pay attention. Then, a few months ago, I saw her as the opening act for the Stones when they played San Francisco. Liking what I heard, I picked up a copy of C'MON C'MON. I'm glad I did. This is, the best contemporary rock CD I've listened to in quite a while. It has a nice mix of bouncy rockers and slower ballads, witty lyrical observations and poignant personal statements. Catchy hooks and pretty melodies abound. The rockers are the ones I like best, and there are several good ones here. Besides &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;, which has received lots of airplay, other personal favorites include &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, &quot;You're An Original&quot;, &quot;Lucky  Kid&quot;, &quot;Abilene&quot;, and &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;. There really isn't a clinker on the entire CD, though.<br />Characterized by excellent songwriting, crisp musicianship, and  Crow's fine vocals, C'MON C'MON is an outstanding CD. Not perfect. There are several great guest players on this album (i.e. Stevie Nicks) and they are mostly lost in the production. Stevie sings backing vocals on a couple of the songs, but you'd never know it was her. A duet somewhere would have been nice. That's a very minor criticism, however. This is a terrific cd and a worthy addition to any rock music collection.ition to any rock music collection.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This, movie, to describe, there are no words. To many people it may semm a &quot;low point in stielbergh's career', but to everbody else, it is the high point. This is a movie you will rent again and again until you finally buy it. the characters are perfect, and they match who they play, it is just a great allround movie
B00003CXAT|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters when I was in middle school.  I was left in shock by this wonderful film by Spielburg.  He does a great job of making these dinosaus beautiful and terrifying at the same time.  <br />If you have read the book by Michael Crichton and have not seen this flick, you may be dissappointed.  Many aspects of this film were changed, leaving a very different outcome, and pretty much film in general.  But even though it doesn't follow the book, it is still one heck of a movie.<br />The widescreen edition DVD has a great look and great sound that makes you feel as if you are in a theater.  The sound of the T-Rex screaming will leave you will chills, thinking that the huge reptile is standing outside of your door.  <br />This is a must have in your DVD collection for any MC, Spielburg, or dino fan.
B00005JL96|5.0|I have watched Disney movies all my life (since I was born which was about 15 years ago) and have not seen one this good. I have one complaint though about the reviewers on this review board. To Doting and Concerned Parents: LOOK ON THE BACK OF COVERS AT THE RATINGS! This movie was rated PG by the MPAA for mild sci-fi action violence. This is what you ignorant people are thinking, Hmm, I think I'll take my kids to a movie with lots of violence even though I know its not good for them. You're stupid! Just shut up and go read your mommy magazines. Sit down and shut up! Movies that are rated G are for all audiences and are not inappropriate for kids. Movies that are rated PG are for ages 6 and up due to minor objectionable content. Get the picture! Anyway, now that I got the other \\"PARENT\\" readers in their place, onto why I think \\"L&S\\" is a great movie for parents with kids 6 AND OLDER, not 5 and YOUNGER. <br />Lilo and Stitch is a cute story because it has great family values. One of the values that I admired about this movie is the one thing that alot of people noticed and love. The phrase \\"Ohana means family an family mean no one gets left behind\\". This is a phrase to live by. If you follow that phrase, you can have a great life with your family. Now parents who are concerned about this movie: there is some minor objectionable content in the movie. There are some minor Star Wars style laser gun fights that might scare your young ones. In all the years that Disney has put out movies, you don't think that they'd start ruining their reputation by throwing in bad words is stupid. There are some rude words if that's what you meant. There are some instances of that but its all minor (words like \\"stupidhead\\" are used and that's not bad). This movie is okay for kids over 6. It's not recommended at all for kids younger than that specified age so don't try to sneak it in. Anyway, this is a really cute family movie to watch with your family on a Sunday night.
B00003CXA6|5.0|If you are a Civil War freak, this movie is for you.  No ands ifs or buts about it, this movie is great.  This movie is based on the best selling novel by Michael Shaara called \\"The Killer Angels\\".  I read the book before I saw the movie and it was excellent.  I was not to sure what to expect when I was given this movie, but was shocked as to how well it was done.  The movie mimics the book wonderfully, and the acting is great, filled with an all-star cast.  <br />The three days of the battle are shown with all the heart and sadness that one can bear.  You get a feel of what the soldiers were put through during this terrible war, and during the turning point and most famous battle of the Civil War.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the greatest American History movie of all time.
B000000LZV|5.0|Impossible to classify other than really, really good. Musical styles are all over the board. Extremely expressive music.
1577311523|3.0|First of all, I need to come clean: I have not read the book, just the reviews. I'm sure that this book has value for many people. Please, just realize that Buddhism (and probably other religions/philosophies) have long taught the same thing. Many Buddhist meditations are about stilling the mind and dealing with afflictive emotions (anger, greed, lust, etc.).<br />If you like this book, that's great, but please be aware that these ideas have been around for some time. You may also benefit from books on Buddhist meditation, no matter what your religious affiliation or faith.
0440237688|5.0|In Lowry's book you are transported to a place devoid of emotion; a place where there are no past mistakes to look back and learn from. That is unless you are \\"The Reciever of Memory.\\" In the socieyt where our main character, Jonas, lives there is only one person who carries all of the memories for the entire society. This method is used to shelter the society from uneccessary problems such as bad weather, love, and pain. The idea works except one person must hold the burden for everyone. <br />In her book Lowry's provides detailed descriptions of such complicated emotions as anger, grief, and true happiness so that you can experience them yourself. The book is not purely for entertainment value, it definitely will evoke some serious thinking. By the end of this novel it is guaranteed you will feel everything Jonas has been through.
0316666343|5.0|While I am a voracious reader, I have never taken the time to actually pen my own review. After reading The Lovely Bones, I realized that maybe I just hadn't read a book that struck that kind of chord for me before. This book grabbed you from the first paragraph and didn't let go. It was written with such an intesity that at times I had to put it down just to regroup to continue reading with the attention that the book demanded. The viewpoint was refreshingly different and the characters were flawed...which keeps this book from being over-the-top. The ending was a little anti-climactic- but I forgive the author, I was infinitely pleased by the content. There isn't anyone in the world that I wouldn't recommend this book to.
B00005B36H|5.0|I just read a couple of reviews that say this is not &quot;Tool's best stuff&quot; - I completely disagree.  While I love Aenima and Undertow, I cherish Lateralus.  I think it's the final evolution of the genre.  The messages are more constructive than Tool's previous albums, and the album as a whole has a deeper substance.  From mathematical algorithms used in the instrumentals, to spiritual references in the lyrics; this album picks up where the track &quot;Third Eye&quot; left us and takes us into the great beyond.  I also like it much more than A Perfect Circle and the Tapeworm that I've heard.  Unfortunately the album has a feel that makes me think Maynard has brought the band to its final destination, and will retire it.  I sincerely hope this isn't true.
B00005ABX0|1.0|This is, without a doubt, among the worst The Beach Boys had to offer. These two LPs \\"Smiley Smile\\" and \\"Wild Honey\\" put together as a 2-fer CD are certainly among the worst I've ever heard EVER!  Unlike contemporaries of their day like The Beatles, The Hollies, The Stones, etc. - their music never matured. Why \\"Pet Sounds\\" was ever compared to The Beatles \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is another mystery to me. There is NO comparison. These two LPs on this 2-fer CD prove that The Beach Boys should have hung it up and stayed out of the studio until they got their collective acts cleaned up. They also proved they were no match for the Beatles. These two albums are simply nothing but childish trash. Vocally, the Beach Boys sound terribly flat and as if they each quickly smoked a pack of cigarettes before going into the recording studio to sing (or attempt to sing). The only decent song on this CD is \\"Good Vibrations\\" which can be found on numerous other CDs. So, don't buy it here! \\"Heroes and Villans\\" is passable as are \\"Darlin\\" and \\"Here Comes The Night.\\" However, their dance remake in the latter part of the 70s of \\"Here Comes The Night\\" is BY FAR better vocally and musically and the best rendition of \\"Darlin\\" is by singer Paul Davis. So, check those out instead. Perhaps the biggest atrocity on this CD is their version of the Stevie Wonder classic \\"I Was Made To Love Her.\\" They absolutely murder this great song. Brian Wilson wanted us to Smiley \\"SMILE\\" when we listened to the first LP on this 2-fer (which is, by far, the WORST of the two and among the worst LPs I've ever heard in my 42 years on this planet); but all it made me do was grimace! It should have been called Frowny Frown instead of Smiley Smile! What a disaster this LP was. Wild Honey was at least listenable, but not much better lyrically or vocally. Musically, it does have some merit, although not much! But, if you want feel good music of this type, buy some Four Seasons instead. Now, THEY could harmonize and matured withthe times. If you want CDs with substance.... well, you could buy just about anything other than this; but, Sgt. Pepper would be a start. The Beatles certainly proved they were far superior to the Beach Boys with Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, etc. They matured as vocalists and songwriters and left Brian Wilson and Company in the dust (or on the beach, burning... with envy!) If you want The Beach Boys, buy a hits collection! Whatever you do, save your money. I wish I had. Don't buy this one. This 2-fer is nothing but garbage. The ONLY reason Capitol ever released these two LPs years ago is because it was The Beach Boys. Capitol would have laughed anyone else out of their offices if they had come in with this mindless drivel. Just look at the song titles: Vegetables, W. Woodpecker Symphony, She's Goin Bald, Gettin' Hungry, etc. Yes! They are as BAD as they sound. Don't waste your money on this one!
B0000028RR|5.0|Only two albums, of the many i have listened to, do NOT have a dud track. The first is &quot;Doggystyle&quot; (Snoop Doggy Dogg). &quot;Rage against the machine&quot; (RATM) is the second. Coincidentally, they were both debut albums. As a big hip hop/rap fan, RATM is the only metal band i consider worthy of being called true hip hop/metal. The imitations today, are a joke compared to Rage. They have a unique sound that can never be reproduced. All 10 songs are well made, truthful, and still extremely relevant today. Predictably, i would have to say that &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; is my favourite, but 99% of listeners will still love the other 9 tracks. Rage are the pioneers of their genre, and they will never be topped in my mind. Its just a shame they only produced 3 albums before they broke up :(
B00000F14B|4.0|There is no contest.  Watching the new Disney version made me run to this site to buy the old version!  It is sad to think that Broderick's Professor Hill may be all our children will know of the Music Man.    Preston was a genius.  Shirley Jones plays Marian as she should be played: intelligent but woefully romantic, and a bit of a mystery.  Get this version for a family nite in.
B000084T18|5.0|50 is the greatest out there. With da instant hit \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"In Da Club\\" no one can match the kid. He is the best he is bringing back GANGSTA music, not like DEATH ROW but it is back. He brings a sense of a BIG FUTURE for hip hop. I know the SOURCE magazine better give is 5 MICS. He is bringing back some of his old hits along with the new ones. The best song on the album to me is \\"Not Like Me\\". It is raw and clear cut, i know it is old but u gotta feel tha song. \\"Many Men\\" is a hit also i would expect it to be his next single off of da album. Everywhere I go all I hear is 50, 50, 50. Right now it is ALL ABOUT 50 CENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000075BFK|5.0|Ok well #1, I burned this album and its really good.  The intro really sets the stage for him but it also ruins the courage for the fans that 2pac will come back because it is becoming a little more public.  Its a great album 5 stars.  I am a huge fan so I hope for me and my fellow fans either April 7, 2003 or what I think the date will be July 7, 2003 will be the best day in the history of Hip-hop.  If his next album is released on June 30th, 7 days before 7/7/03, I will go crazy.  7/7/03: The Rebirth
B00006J9OT|5.0|Boy, am I glad I bought the \\"Live in Paris\\" CD. I was hesitant at first, because except for Billy Joel's \\"Just the Way You Are\\", I already own all of DK's recordings of the songs in this set, as well as the DVD version of the concert.<br />However, the repertoire is lovingly pared down to a well-rounded selection from the original nearly two-hour performance. And without the visual distraction of watching gorgeous Diana in person, it hit me how much more punch the live versions pack over the pristine-perfect studio versions. That's not to say the live sound quality isn't extraordinary: it is. But Diana's delivery itself is so intense, focused, and emotional, it's truly like hearing the songs for the first time. In particular, \\"A Case of You\\" and \\"Maybe You'll Be There\\" are so heartfelt, direct, just this side of the tragic, even the ever-so-slight silent beats speak volumes. These renditions alone would be worth the price of the CD. But every song is is stunning and exciting.<br />\\"Live in Paris\\" epitomizes the skill that Diana brings to music interpretation that is so lacking in today's bellowing, acrobatic \\"American Idol\\" approach, where all the lyrical meaning is obliterated to Kingdom Come.<br />I have some pop-music enthusiast friends who are perplexed by Diana's ingratiation into mainstream pop. They find her \\"scotch and wild honey\\" contralto too unlike the current acceptable music trends. They just don't get it! Listening to DK is like sitting across from her at a table in an intimate cafe while she confides all of life's intimacies. Then she turns around and sets your heart pounding with an up-tempo number like \\"East of the Sun\\" or \\"Devil May Care\\".<br />If you were like me and held off on buying \\"Live in Paris\\" because you thought you had it all, here is all that and more. Do yourself a favor and get it. As they say in Paree, it's the creme de la creme.
0440237688|5.0|Although written on a 5th grade level, \\"The Giver\\" is a book for all ages. It illistrates the importance of having and sharing memories with one another. Jonas, the Giver, and the community learn a great deal about learning what it means to trully live, love, feel, and see. The story proves that without pain there is no passion, and without hate there is no love. I trully enjoyed the book and I recomend it for everyone to read. After reading the book make sure to sit down with a family member and share an intimate memory. The Giver recieves two thumbs up and five golden stars.
B000000OU4|5.0|I lent this CD to my neighbor and started thinking about it for the first time in a few years. I looked it up on Amazon.com on a lark - wow, I had never seen the internet when this came out!<br />I think one perspective missing in the reviews here is that this album came out at a time before a \\"smooth jazz\\" radio station had carved out an infamous spot on the dial in every<br />American metropolis. I.e. back then it didn't sound like a cheesy Peter White album with an upgraded guitar player. Unless you lived close to San Clemente, CA, you probably hadn't heard enough round grooves with jazz guitar to make you puke before this came out.<br />Personally, I'd like to hear Metheny do a groove project every few years. The good stuff on this album is my favorite Metheny music, and that's saying something.
B00007LL7O|5.0|I cannot fathom the fact that someone could give Elements 1 a bad rating!  Artistry and power metal go hand in hand.  Anyone who believes this record to be \\"way too artistic\\" is not a proper power metal fan; they are most likely a death or noise metal fan.  I bought the Elements Pt. 1 limited box set for about $...  The first thing that caught my attention was the fabulous images and art work of the box.  Wow!  Perhaps the best cover I have ever seen- absolutely stunning!  This brilliancy continues throughtout the CD insert and onto the disc itself.  Stratovarius dropped some major cashola on the album art, let me say.  Of course the graphics are merely frosting, what matters is the music- Stratovarius do NOT disappoint.  Elegant and extremely well produced songs from beginning to finale!  The music is not all lightning fast as the band mixes slow material with the blazers- this is really smart.  Many power metal bands just cook throughout their albums which makes for a boring experience as there are no aural dynamics.  Elements has beautiful choral arrangements coupled with pertinent lyrics.  Jorg Michael's drum attack is powerful and awe inspiring.  He happens to be one of my favorite drummers.  Timo Tolkki's guitar work is most deliciously tasteful; it does not dominate every song- this allows the compositions to \\"breathe\\" with meaning and fire.  Kotipelto's voice is stunning and smooth, he is a real singer, not a screamer.  My box set came with an additional CD of bonus material- 3 tracks.  There's also a cool sticker and an expanded booklet separate from the CD insert.  My only gripe (and it's a small one at that) is that the main disc came as a standard jewel case, not as a digipak.  A digipak set-up of Elements would have been the perfect last touch.  Be that as it may, overall presentation (music and art work) deserves more than just a five star rating!  Buy this album!  It will be on everyone's top ten list come the end of 2003, just you wait and see!-DavidNewman
B00006RU5B|5.0|At first thought, no one could ever imagine how it would be like to add the voice of Chris Cornell, to the ever groove of Rage Against The Machine. Well, now we know. It is an awesome experience to listen to this two powerful forces collaborate, combine their musical talents together and achieve what they have achieved. They do not belong in any genre of today's music, for they belong in their own world of great music. Cornell's voice is at his best with his perfect melodic interpertration while Morello's riffs are certainly one of the most creative he has ever written. One just cannot stop to appreciate such beautiful music that they have created. The perfect group, and the perfect CD to show that nu metal is really getting tiresome. You won't regret buying, it'll stay in your player till another one of thier album comes out.
B0000042H4|4.0|The Solti &quot;Ring&quot; is often reviewed as though it were a single recording. Of course it isn't; it's four opera recordings, made over a period of eight years.  Each recording was a separate project, and inevitably, some are better than others.  They all share Solti's nervous, energetic approach to Wagner; it certainly doesn't sound like the &quot;long line&quot; approach to Wagner, and is often criticized on that basis.  But there's more than one way to conduct a masterpiece, and Solti's approach justifies itself with its sense of drama and musical storytelling; it's as valid an approach as any other, and superbly executed by the Vienna Philharmonic and the sound engineers.<br />&quot;Rheingold&quot; shook up the recording industry in 1959 with its advances in sound quality and its huge sales. While the sound is still impressive today, the cast has been surpassed on later recordings. Essentially it's a good, solid Vienna repertory cast of the late '50s, with the exception of Flagstad's cameo as Fricka -- which, to be honest, is not all that great.  The best thing on the recording is the Alberich of Gustav Neidlinger.<br />&quot;Walkure&quot; was the last of these operas to be recorded, and the sessions were interrupted by conflicts with the orchestra; this perhaps contributed to Hans Hotter sounding considerably less than his best as Wotan.  The set is still worthwhile, especially for Regine Crespin's Sieglinde, the starry lineup of Valkyries, and Christa Ludwig's Fricka. But there are many recordings of &quot;Walkure,&quot; and some of them are preferable to this one.<br />&quot;Siegfried&quot; also had troubled sessions, mainly because the original Siegfried, Ernst Kozub, was fired for having failed to learn the part properly. Wolfgang Windgassen was the only other possible choice at the time, and while his voice was hardly ideal, he's probably better than anyone who has recorded the role since then.  Hotter is better here than in &quot;Walkure,&quot; and everyone else is fine.  This is probably a first choice for this opera, but you'll have to hear the old Melchior recordings to hear a really ideally-sung Siegfried.<br />&quot;Gotterdammerung&quot; is by far the best in Solti's cycle, and, not coincidentally, had the most trouble-free sessions. This is one of those rare opera recordings where everything went right; there are no weak links in this cast (from the stars right down to young soon-to-be-stars like Lucia Popp and Helen Watts) and the use of sound effects and stereo staging creates a truly theatrical experience even without visuals.<br />So if you're buying just one recording in Solti's &quot;Ring,&quot; make it &quot;Gotterdammerung.&quot;  If you want to buy the &quot;Ring&quot; under a single conductor, Solti's is probably the best bet (the weakest parts aren't as bad as, say, the weakest parts of Karajan's or Levine's &quot;Ring&quot;s). Otherwise, get &quot;Gotterdammerung&quot; and possibly &quot;Siegfried,&quot; and then get &quot;Walkure&quot; by Karajan or Leinsdorf, and &quot;Rheingold&quot; by Karajan or Levine.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Have you been wandering the movie store aisles looking for a nice flick to watch at home with a bucket of popcorn? And you wandered into the horror section just to pass the time? And you know you hate horror? Or even if you do... Well, 'It' is nw my favorite movie. I was afraid of it when I was younger but now that I'm 12, this movie isn't scary at all.<br />Take it from me, my mom HATES scary movie. She absolutely HATES them. But she willingly sat down and watched this movie with me. It can be a little exciting at parts though. (Horror fans, I am like you. I need a good scary movie. But this is just so odd and marvelous). A stephen king clasic! Horror fans will love it, and people who hate them, well, you'll enjoy it more than you thought you would.<br />But to those people who need to know the \\"scary\\" parts before they see it, here goes. (NOTE: DONT READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED!!!!!) <br />1. Clown in storm drain kills kid. <BR>2. Freakish clown face and odd voice.<BR>3. Occasional \\"razor sharp teeth\\" from clown.<BR>4.

6300246787|5.0|My husband and I watch this movie over and over. We both do a re-enactment of the Old West the 1860's to the 1890's era, and I make all of my costumes and hats. He plays Wyatt Earp and I play Josie. We so much appreciate the quality of work and hours that went into this production. We would really like to have it in DVD.Is there any possibility that it will be coming out in DVD? There is nothing about this movie that we don't like. Superb! Fantastic! Please bring it back to the stores for sale again. We are afraid that our copy is going to wear out. If only they made movies like that one, now! Thank you so much for the wonderful production!  Sincerely yours, Geri Carnahan-----

B000063USY|1.0|Hollywood has reached an all time low with this movie.  Even the fact that I'm female (i know there are others out there like me too) even I had to laugh at this movie.  First it doesn't show the real street racing.  Every person had their cars picture perfect and what not.  You go out here on the East Coast, you got all kinds whether its stock, sleeper, ricey or whatever.  Nobody's get together is like that.  Second, the information was wrong.  I laughed so many times at the almost humilating wrongness of the movie.  Almost makes me embarressed to drive a Honda (which i do, and i'm proud).  I saw this movie once and not because I wanted to, and I strongly recommend the real tuners and racers out there to just skip this movie and F &amp; F 2 all together.  except for Vin Diesel.  If he wasn't in it, I would have turned it off after I saw Brian shifting 6-7 times in a 5 speed eclipse.  i think i'm gonna be sick now.
0316666343|4.0|This is a beautifully written story from the perspective of a young murdered girl, Susie, who now resides in heaven.  We are able to know what Susie's heaven is like, what she is doing there and how she feels about the people left behind her, here on earth.<br />The story deals with the aftermath of her death and how everyone is affected by her murder.  The grieving process is depicted in an insightful and accurate manner.<br />I thought that the book was both funny and sad.  The characters are memorable and fascinating in their attempts to deal with the loss of one of their own.  It is a story that will stay with you for some time, even after the cover is closed.
B000002UD0|5.0|Any John Lennon album without Yoko automatically gets 5 stars in my book!  This album was written and recorded during John's &quot;Lost Weekend&quot;.  Some think it was great when he went back to Yoko and ended their separation.  I think the &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; should have been extended indefinitely.<br />This album, though, yes, it does have filler, bristles with urgency.  John's singing on &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; is rivaled in excllence only by his efforts on &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;.  On &quot;POB&quot; John was singing about his pain in a cathartic effort to make it go away.  &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; offers no Dr. Janov quick-fix for misery.  John's in pain, and he's only got Nilsson's bloody Brandy Alexanders to soothe him.  This gives his performances a real edge of desparation.<br />John, along with his gal-pal, May Pang, was actually attempting to discover himself as a real person, an individual, during the sessions for &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;.  He didn't have The Beatles or Brian Epstein making decisions for him.  He didn't have the dictatorial control of Yoko Ono hovering around him.  I felt excited for John during this period.  He could've broken free and discovered himself for himself.  <br />Within months after the release of &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; John went slinking back to the Yoko cocoon where he would curl up in the fetal position and let her make the decisions once again for the rest of his life.  We wouldn't get another recording from John until 1980.  Again, he would be making a John/Yoko recording.  He would be dead before the end of that year.
0345448898|5.0|This trilogy is amazing!! I was immediately hooked, right from the beginning of the first one. It was so good that after finishing it I went to the library as soon as I could to see if there were the other two. You can imagine my disappointment when I found that they were not there! But I was so hooked up by the series that I had to go to the nearest book shop and see if it had them! Luckily for me it did and I have never been so addicted to a trilogy like this. While reading it I was continually wishing that I would get to the end and see how it would end (I also had homework to do) but at the same time I wished that the books were never ending! Unfortunately they are not infinite but they're so good that I'm sure that no matter how many times I read them I will never get bored of them! The trilogy is a very good combination of fantasy and quantum physics!
0066214122|4.0|This novel was not up to normal Crichton standards.  The last 150 pages were exciting and made it hard to put down, but the first 150 pages were boring and almost caused me to quit reading it.  I was expecting a story like Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Congo, or Timeline that got you into the action fast as well as taught you about the science and technology Crichton is covering in the story. <BR>He did cover how the emerging nanotechnology of molecular robots combined with biotechnology and computer technology could get out of control on its own.  These molecular robots swarmed together and developed emergent behavior (learning new responses to new stimuli) based on a predator model which becomes life-threatening to those who created them.<BR>The book is worth reading, but not one that enthralls the reader from beginning to end.
B000069HJM|2.0|John's &quot;Reg Strikes Back&quot; sounds like this album.<br />This album is listenable, but that is about it.  It IS more listenable than &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; but is not a CD that you will carry in the car.<br />It is very cheerful, especially considering 'tramp's back catalog of gloom and doom.  Not much like &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; (it predecessor) to which I can and do still listen occasionally.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is so solid from beginning to end.  These are hard core beats.  I can't remember a more definitive album since Easy_e and Dre ran NWA.  50 cent is strong....eminem and Dre have themselves a winner.  I am addicted to these beats.  I cant stop listening.
0780631684|5.0|This movie was the best horror movie I'd seen in a very long time.  Devon Sawa plays his character well, and I particularly enjoy the first scene on the airplane where he realizes that his vision is turning into reality.  His premonition saves the lives of 6 people.  Death is not ready to surrender though, and one by one the survivors encounter the grim reaper on much more...morbid circumstances.  Watch for the scene when the teacher dies, that is by far the most gory of the whole movie in my opinion and I had to cover my eyes.  This is a horror movie that teens and adults will enjoy.  Looking forward to going to see the second one!
044651652X|4.0|I picked this book up because of the familiar title and after reading it I fell in love with Robert James Waller and his ideas. The Bridges of Madison County was a wonderful love story - the kind that every girl wishes could happn to them. I found myself admiring both Francesca and Robert for their decisions and their maturity in handling the circumstances. I feel that the sort of love that Robert James Waller wrote abut in The Bridges of Madison County is rare in today's society and this book was a nice reminder that it can still exist!
0553212478|5.0|Mary Shelley had no idea when she wrote this that centuries later it would be enjoyed, or that the idea presented in the book would actually be an issue.  She presents the issue of \\"playing\\" God or creating life.  This is the very issue that we are dealing with now as far as cloning goes.  What are the consequences of creating a creature?  According to Shelley we may be overwhelmed with what we have done, and be unable to control the outcome.  Frankenstein is a book that everyone should read and think about long and hard.  For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction...  A great read, don't miss it!
B000084T18|5.0|I got this album on the first day it came out, poped it in my CD player and ..., all the songs were good. Thats rare that all the songs are realy good. 50 is showing that he is the hottest new rapper out there and he really proved it by this album. I have no personal favorite but i love patiently waiting, many men, high all the time, and in da club. I love the whole CD. If your getting one CD this year make it 50 Cent.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Thank you Andrew W.K. for the most refreshing album I have heard in a looong time!  This album has restored my faith in music again.  Melodic, powerful, fun, intense, angry, happy...this album has it all.  Get this album now!!!  Long live the genius that is Andrew W.K.!!!
0345446798|5.0|This is not only wonderful to read, but surrounded with useful food for thought. Patricia has a refreshing outlook into the canine mind. <BR>Well worth the time and money!
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is one of the most awesome blues discs I have come across.  It's actually older than I am, but the sound is awesome.  It was playing in the other room, and I kept wondering who was yelling at me!  Muddy's known for his electric side, but this doesn't lose anything by going acoustic.  With Buddy Guy and Willie Dixon as the backing band, how can you go wrong.  A great CD for those interested in the REAL blues.
B0000062S0|5.0|I avoided this one when it came out, wary of the possibility of an embarassing superstar-reunion-type situation. I bought it used, on a whim, not really expecting much. But I'm eating my words with a spoon. This is truly one of the finest albums I have ever heard. Each of the songs is strong, and together, they create a powerful collection, completely deserving of the Grammy won in 1999 (for &quot;Most High&quot;).<br />Jimmy Page's performance is a terrific surprise. While no one can fault his godlike capability with his instrument, many of his post-Zep solo efforts have seemed a little cold and clinical. Here, he weaves a lush wall of sound that is not only a mindblowing ride up and down the fingerboard, but is also warm, passionate, yearning, experimental. Plant's voice has retained its visceral beauty; this album expands his thematic and emotional ranges. The songwriting is powerful: solid, mature lyrics paired with impeccable musical composition. It's like Zeppelin all grown up --- this is what the band *could* have achieved if not for John Bonham's untimely passing. The only way it could have been improved (not that it needs improvement) would be if John Paul Jones had made an appearance. For anyone who hasn't checked out JPJ's solo work, especially the eponymous &quot;Zooma&quot;, you're missing out.<br />If you enjoyed the &quot;No Quarter&quot; version of &quot;Nobody's Fault but Mine,&quot; and Plant's latest, &quot;Dreamland,&quot; you will *love* this album.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Seriously, this cd ROCKS! I listen to the whole cd, nonstop. Its one of those CD's where.. you dont have to skip any songs. ALlLLLLlLlLlL of them are awesome. I especially like the song 30 mins. . I say you get the cd... whats not to love?
B000084T18|5.0|Tupac died. Biggie Died. 50 has just been born or should I say reborn. This is the real deal folks. If you've been looking for something, anything to put in your CD player worthy enough for the shuffle button, buy this album. Ask yourself, did we really have to worry about a Dre and Eminem production which features a street rapper whose flow has already gone ghetto platinum. We love Dre! We love Eminem! Now, we will love 50!
B00005JLXC|4.0|Having grown up in the time when DD first came out, I had doubts the film could do the comics justice. Ben A just did not come across as being the right one for the part. I was wrong; the movie actually inserted the emotional factor which can't be garnered from just reading. If you're a DD fan, you'll love it; if not, you'll still like it.
B000067CPX|5.0|Definitely softer (i.e. more melodic &amp; less frenzied) than other RHCP albums - but great stuff - I got it as an xmas present from my wife who bought it just for the Zephyr track.  Can't wait for the summer - hanging out with a beer and pumping this out for the neighbors :)<br />Enjoy - great songs, fun, not too serious.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is one of the best movies we have seen in a very long time!!  It's no wonder it's been nominated 13 times.  Photography is exceeded only by choreography...would recommend to anyone who likes music!  Rene Zellwieger shines as Roxie and Richard Ghere brings out a side never seen before.
B000059QY3|5.0|Obviously a lot of effort has been put into this production to give this classical work a fresh new look. The set is stylishly simple, worked especially well for the first two Acts. The costumes are sumptuous, especially those of Violetta's. The orchestra is lush and clear. Sir Georg Solti, who is on camera during overture and some of the instrumental passages, leads the music into a world that's extremely touching. But the most distinguished of this production is Angela Gheorghiu, in the role of Violetta. Gheorghiu has brought life to this Verdi's tragic heroine. Her vocal power and beautiful looks have won many of the audience, including me. She is exquisite or even unique in her way of acting, including her facial expression, hand and body gesture, reflecting her deep connection with the character. Her Violetta is full of drama and range, which is everything you'd imagine for this character: her arrogance, her kindness, her weakness, and her vulnerability. Vocally she is very strong. She certainly is one of the greatest sopranos in the world, if not the greatest. It is a joy to watch her singing. Because of all the brilliancies about Angela Gheorghiu, it must be hard to find a tenor who can match her vocal ability and her stage presence at the same time. Frank Lopardo, although with a good tenor voice, is unable to bring any depth to Alfredo due to his limited acting. Other than singing Alfredo's music lines (half the times with his eyes closed), he wasn't trying hard in his acting. <BR>The freshness would be totally succeeded, if not for the staging that still falls into the conventions of its own tradition and some weaknesses in the acting, but still it is a great production, and Gheorghiu can be the only reason to own this DVD.
B0000636UN|4.0|After many albums and many hits Sheryl is back with a new studio album. \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" finds Crow at her best, as it combines the best elements which made her previous releases enjoyable.<br />   Most of the disc goes in a  light rock direction which fits her voice really well, and the moods of the cd do not vary alot from track to track. \\"Steve McQueen\\" is a catchy rock song which you will have stuck in your head for days...well, at least the chorus bit where she sings \\"Like Steve McQueen , all I need's a fast machine , I'm gonna make it all right\\". Single \\"Soak up the sun\\" has got the traditional Sheryl sound though her voice is not at her best.<br />    The standout track is for sure \\"It's so easy\\", a ballad featuring Don Henley which after three and a half minutes will leave you wanting more. It goes in a similar way to Aerosmith big hit \\"Crazy\\" and it has \\"smash hit\\" written all over it.<br />   Others songs that work really well for Crow are \\"Safe and sound\\" which will have you thinking if it was stolen from a Natalie Imbruglia album and \\"Abilene\\" which reminds of Sheryl's previous works.<br />   When it comes to lyrics the album seems not to find a direction. The songs are both beautiful and thoughtful (\\"Diamond Road\\", \\"Safe and sound\\") or plain stupid (\\"Soak up the sun\\") though these are usually enjoyable for their musicality. So, you won't be paying attention to if that song you've been singing all week contains intelligent lyrics.<br />   With an entire album produced herself you can tell she knows what she's doing. She knows what works best for her and made of \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" her best album to date.
B000069AUI|4.0|I liked Parachutes. It was sweet and swell. But it took a few listens to grow on me as a whole. A Rush of Blood to the Head, however, leapt into my heart within the first 10 seconds of \\"Politik\\". The band charges into songs like \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" and \\"Clocks\\" with a hitherto unknown intensity. Best of all is the seething title track. I was (dare I say it) shocked to hear Chris Martin (of all people) intone \\"I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down/I'm gonna put it six feet underground\\". Sexy! Throught its 54 minutes, the album brims with confidence and maturity. No sophomore jinx here. Highly recommmended.<br />Key Tracks: \\"Politik\\", \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", \\"Clocks\\", \\"Daylight\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"A Whisper\\"
B00004YRQA|4.0|This card isnt subject to having a block size (unlike the PS1 cards), which means that you can put over 15 save files on it easily, unlike the PS1 card that took one block for one save, no matter how big or small the save file was.  Sorry but there is not much really to review here.
B00006RU5B|2.0|It lacks the fire of both early Soundgarden and early RATM.  The songs are there, they sound like &quot;rock&quot;, but they also sound like the very reason kids today are looking elsewhere.<br />There is nothing here you haven't heard already, but that would be excusable if it just had a little fire going.  Rock'n'roll is yelling into a microphone with a loud wailing guitar and a thundering base. Here we have the dictionary definition of rock'n'roll, sans anything that would endear the listener. What made Soundgarden and RATM great is what makes this mediocre. That both bands were waning before this is notable.<br />They only sound truly inspired every so many songs, and usually they can't even get a full 4 minutes out of it.  The sound is great, the chops are there, and the music goes in one ear and out the other.
B000001EL3|5.0|Being a cd released to a mostly Teenage crowd (back in the 70s) it appeals to mostly teens.  The songs lyrics more than speak for that.  Its a great classic rock CD, all of the songs are for the most part harmless IMO.  The only one track that speaks a bit heavy metal (and satanism) is God Of Thunder.  And being one of the albums which characterize's KISS in the 70s (in their peak) it is one of the albums which is attributed to the band most often (this and the Alive! album).   Its definitely a must have for anyones rock collection.  You should particulary enjoy Beth, Shout It Out Loud, Detroit Rock City, God Of Thunder and King Of The Nighttime world.<BR>This cd has the last unnanounced track  that was on the original unremastered copy (the unnanounced &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Party&quot; it was Great Expectations recorded backwards, which was meant to parody what Christians and Parents were saying that playing KISS's music backwards gave a Satanic subliminal message of some sort) dont worry it isnt much, except for something of a comedic value.  This cd sounds much better than the original release because of its being re-recorded using better technology.<BR>This album went Gold fairly quickly, do I need to say more?
0151006903|3.0|In Voltaire's Candide a motley group of characters traipse around the world encountering one disaster after another. Candide, although structured as a comic adventure, had as its real purpose the ridicule and savaging of  the Catholic church. <br />Eco's Baudolino has a similar purpose: to ridicule and savage the Christian faith, especially its reliance on relics, and the brutality of the Christian knights toward their kinsman of the same faith. However, Baudolinos story has a special charm in that we participate in some actual history of the period (the Fourth Crusade).<br />Unfortunately, I was put off by the many half-human creatures and monsters Eco creates for Baudolino to encounter.  I kept trying to understand why the author felt compelled  to create such characters when the historical narrative was interesting enough.  For me the creatures were distracting or, in the case of the beautiful female satyr, whom Baudolino romances, disgusting.<br />Although Baudolino's adventures have much more depth and interest than Candide's, the unreal creatures in Baudolino left me with an unsatisfactory feeling.
B000002GBB|1.0|STYX hit it big with Grand Illusion in 1977. Unfortunately, Pieces of 8 is merely a repeat of Grand Illusion. No new musical direction is advanced here. The songs are a step under those of the &quot;Grand Illusion&quot; and one has to wonder if they were simply the songs that didn't make the cut. Styx would soon see that they needed to evolve to continue their survival and they did with flying colors on CORNERSTONE.
B000088E6M|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums yet.  It's a flawless blend of some of the illest lyrics and incredible beats I've heard yet.  Em and Dre have discovered themselves a legend in the making.  Not since Styles P have I heard such an amazingly talented lyricist who knows how to keep it straight up gangsta!  50 -- keep doing your thing, baby!
B000002JSR|5.0|Thats the great thing about bands as good as Led Zeppelin, even their lost studio scraps and out takes, while it may be their worst, is still great by general standards. Poor Tom, Darlene, and Ozone Baby could've been highlights of other albums had they actually been put on. Wearing and Tearing is what could be considerd Zeppelin's grunge masterpiece, and the 2 live tracks that were put on are some excellent performences. While ill agree this should be one of your last Zeppelins albums to put into your collection, by all means do not forget it, or you'll be losing their final act of 1 of the greatest bands ever.
0385503954|3.0|A friend warned me that the first 50 pages were very slow going, but that he thought it picked up after that.  At 65, 70, 75 pages it was still creeping along.<br />It may well be all that the five-star reviewers say it is. But if you're the &quot;get on with it&quot; type who has another 10 books in your read pile, I think you'll be apt to move on to the next book relatively quickly.
B00000I07Q|5.0|New Jersey is by far the climax of Bon Jovi's carrer and of 80's metal. Bad medicine, Lay your Hands on Me, Born to be my Baby, and 99 in the shade are prime examples of what metal is supposed to be about, good times and good lyrics, not just trying to pump it full of swears. Then there are the excellent power ballads such as I'll be there for you and Wild is the Wind, which are some of Bon Jovi's best. And of course, the short filler tract Ride Cowboy Ride, which is actually surprsingly good. It really is a shame how this Album gets overshadowed by Slippery when wet, which is excellent by all means, but this is just so much better. All new fans should pick up this album 1st, then you'll be hooked on Bopn Jovi for life.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this CD - every song. I'm all for people having there own opinions, but really. If you think she sounds like Britney then I'd suggest that perhaps you are not that that great at - how shall I put it? - listening. Anyone who has even semi-good hearing can tell the difference between them. <BR>And you know what? It's -really- sad judging her on her clothes. And Scotlabdwho cares if she can't skate? Who cares if she isn't that punky? And who really cares if some of her lyrics are just for fun? Maybe some people should pay more attention to her music, than Avril Lavigne herself. If -she- wanted to be rated on, she wouldn't be a singer. Her songs are what's important. You don't like them? Fine. But I don't see how you'd get anywhere but dissing -her.- I very much doubt you even know her personally - so if you put her down, then you are looking to be very shallow, I'm afraid.
B000002BYD|5.0|A friend of mine picked up this album before I had a chance to get it, so my first tastes came in small doses.  Those tastes were convincing enough to get me to pick up my own copy.  The biggest selling point for me, initially, was the lyricism of &quot;Yield.&quot;  The songs &quot;Given to Fly,&quot; &quot;Wishlist,&quot; &quot;Do the Evolution,&quot; and &quot;In Hiding&quot; contain some of the finest lyrics that Pearl Jam has ever put to music.  Terribly moving and, more often than not, challenging, these lyrics prove &quot;Yield&quot; is really quite a self-contradicting name for the album (unless you're looking at it from the vantage of the listener yielding to it).<br />Apart from impressive lyrics, the instrumentation on this album places it among the best of the late nineties.  From flat-out garage rock, to groovy funk rock--from opus rock that's very reminiscent of Zeppelin, to beautiful ballads--this album gives the listener their money's worth.  As some others have said, this is a great introductory album for those just becoming familiar with the band.  It's also a good album to pick up if you're one of those unfortunate (read: stupid) folks who felt that everything started to go downhill for PJ after Vs. and didn't bother to pick up any more of their CDs.<br />One of my favorite lyrics from the album (dig the acoustic, and Ed singing ever so gently):<BR>&quot;Stunned by my own reflection.  It's looking back--sees me too clearly.  And I swore I'd never go there again, not unlike a friend that lightly drags you down.....&quot;    from &quot;Pilate&quot;
0440237688|4.0|I found The Giver to be a shockingly realistic portrayal of what a conformist future may be like. Everything and everyone is the same, and variation is rare if it exists at all. It is here we find Jonas, a 11 year old boy about to turn 12. <br />When a person comes of age at 12, they are assigned a job to do for the rest of their life. Because of this, I thought that the book may have had communist undertones. More in the sense of a Utopian communism than a communism in reality. Everyone is the same, and has the same things. The world is ideal. There is no pain, suffering, war, or grief.<br />I feel that The Giver flawlessly depicts the struggle of an individual in a society that is unwilling to change. Jonas is forced to deal with how he feels, and the knowledge he is different from everyone else. I found the plainess of the other characters to be an excellent foil for Jonas's differences.<br />The book leads to a stunning conclusion I found to be a perfect ending to the story.
0316666343|5.0|If you take a pass on reading this book, you will be missing one of the most unique, unusual, and creative fiction stories that has been on the market for many years. The only other books that are so unique, unusual, and creative are the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Lord Of The Ring&quot; type books (in fiction), and, &quot;West Point:...&quot; (Norman Thomas Remick) in nonfiction (creative nonfiction). If you want an unusual experience, you shouldn't miss reading Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;.
B000063DIH|4.0|Let me preface this review by stating that I feel weel qualified in reviewing this album since I have been listening to metal/hard rock since 1976.  I have been listening to Maiden since '79.  This album is fantastic overall.  There are a few weak moments, but the superior songs far outnumber those lapses.  The main problem is the absence of Adrian Smith and a thin production which makes Nicko's drums sound like a machine.  Janick's studio work is fair (his live show is cheesy and annoying).  It takes a lot of getting used to, but the lyrics and time changes are excellent overall.  This is definitely not their best work, but still very enjoyable and with some great tunes which would have benefitted from Adrian and a more classical production (like the wicker man type of sound).  Up the Irons, lads...........
B000069CWE|5.0|I AM THE BIGGEST LINKIN PARK FAN and all i have to say is this is a great album.  the reason i can say that is because i had all my friends listen to this cd when they were in my truck and all they listen to is rap this rap that.  and they told me why haven't i listened to this group before.  it's quite simple...people always here there songs on the radio like one step closer, in the end, and crawling.  the problem with that is, they play it out!  that makes people not want to listen to the cd, well at least in my friends case.  and all i have to say is GET THIS CD.  i like every song ever made by linkin park and right now you could just start any song and w/in the first 3 seconds of the song i could tell you what it was.  AND I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO GET THE METEORA CD, WHICH COMES OUT ON MARCH 25.  I KNOW I WILL!

B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is leaving the heavier, darker sounds behind more and more as with this album only Tempus Vernum has the ominous Gothic sound to it. The rest of the tracks leave you spellbound with either her signature moving piano pieces or absolutely beautiful vocals. A Day Without Rain opens the album in much the same mood as Watermark did, but then the title track and Wild Child bring such a lovely, hopeful tone that it is hard not to be enchanted with the disc by those two songs alone. After a break with two songs reminiscent of her older sound, Enya continues with more music that lets you simply relax and daydream. Simply beautiful and without a doubt necessary for anyone that likes any Enya song.
B000002KD9|5.0|Wow! What an album. After hearing my buddy's play their version of &quot;When you dance...&quot;, I couldn't get the song out of my head.<BR>So, I had to get the album, Great song! I only had &quot;Decade&quot; and CSNY's &quot;So Far&quot; as far as Neil stuff goes, Oh and Harvest Moon.<BR>Anyhow, now I'm on the search for all the best Neil, Stills, CSNY etc... really good stuff!<br />-jp
B00004T37H|5.0|Ok, I don't have the VHS, but I rented it and I love it!!! Its an mix of adventure, action, and romance. I never really wanted to see this movie at first, but I saw it and rented it. I LOVE IT!!! You have to see it if you like anime.
0767817710|5.0|The Quick and the Dead is an old time favorite of mine that is of course if you can count an eight year old movie as an \\"old time\\" favorite.  One thing is for sure, it couldn't go wrong with this phenomenal cast; Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, Gary Sinise and a Sci-Fi favorite of mine, Lance Henriksen.  This wonderful western is also quite blessed with the original idea of having a heroine in Sharon Stone, given the rarity of a female lead in a western.  Given her exceptional beauty and her extraordinary acting skills, she melds into this role with perfection.<br />The premise:<br />Welcome to Redemption, your typical old west town.  Herod, played by Gene Hackman, is in the villain role, which befits his talents well, since he's at his best as the villain.  Herod is a long time criminal who controls Redemption from the ground up.  He's arranged for a \\"Quick Draw\\" contest for gunslingers.  Ellen, played superbly by the ever beautiful Sharon Stone comes to town with more than just a quick draw competition on her mind.  Cort, played by the then burgeoning superstar, Russell Crowe is a former outlaw and friend of Herods, who has found the lord.  Kid, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, prior to his huge break in \\"Titanic\\" does an acceptable job as the Herod's son and competitor.  Let the competition begin!  Also mentionable along with these outstanding actors are several others, and a number of actors that always to seem to find their small parts in westerns, with an outstanding script, a traditional \\"western\\" score and here we have a fantastic western.<br />I highly recommend this exceptional film to any and all fans of the western genre or to those that rarely allow themselves to be taken back to the wild, wild west, for it is indeed a wonderful trip and just a plain old fun western.<br />Special features:  If you're a special features hound, this one will leave more than disappointed, as its one and only special feature is a theatrical trailer.  For me, as far as this movie is concerned, who cares because this one is just about the escapism of the movie itself!  {ssintrepid}
0060005424|5.0|Garth Nix is a great writer! I loved this book. It had me just page burning and now I'm so glad that the 3rd book in the series is out because, well I can't tell you as you will have to read it yourself. (Plus I love the use of the Clayr vs the Claryoint!) Also the dog really does steal the story once he appears.

0316096199|4.0|The author went through a terrible experience, rape, and describes the experience in a way that makes you feel you are really there.  She also takes you through the aftermath, including later identifying her rapist and going through a trial.  It may be difficult stuff, but it needs to be said.
6300183211|5.0|Brian De Palma's epic blood soaked remake of the 1932 Paul Muni gangster classic may not have gotten all the critical acclaim in the world, but it stands as a landmark performance of the great Al Pacino.  Pacino brings to the screen one of his most well known characters in his career as Tony Montana; a cuban refugee who rises to power in Miami's cocaine underworld.  Along with him is his best friend Manny (Steve Bauer) and the two begin working for Frank (Robert Loggia), a slimy, manipulative excess driven drug kingpin whose wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) Tony soon develops an obsession for.  Oliver Stone wrote the script and helped make Tony one of the most unforgettable characters in all of American cinema.  Scarface has since become a cult classic and contains some of the most memorable lines of dialogue in film, not to mention the most rampant use of profanity that would not be topped for years to come.  The only problem I ever had with Scarface was it's length; clocking in at nearly 3 hours, there are times when the film drags, but that is only a minor complaint.  All in all, if you want to see one of Al Pacino's finest performances (aside from Devil's Advocate, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, or anything beginning with the title The Godfather), then consider Scarface essential viewing, but be warned, this is not a film for all tastes.
B00007BK2N|4.0|24 Hour Party People is not your usual film fare. It tells the true story of the birth of punk music in Manchester, England in an almost documentary approach.<br />That technique is what makes this film work. I'm not a big punk music fan, and the whole culture surrounding it is strange to me, not something I could ever get into, but through the use of the character/narrator Tony Wilson (played by Steve Coogan), this strange world is clearly explained in a humorous but honest commentary. As Wilson interacts with characters in the 70s through 90s, he occasionally breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience from a present-day perspective, in a way providing that 20-20 hind-sight everyone has long after the fact.<br />What this film achieves the most in, however, is the way it blends documentary footage into the film. The whole thing is filmed with a hand-held camera in such a fashion that you almost are fooled into thinking it is a documentary, at least, until Wilson breaks that fourth wall again to remind you. It's a great technique that sets this movie apart from others based on true events.<br />The only real flaw is how time passes without the film ever really letting on. It begins in 1976, and after what feels like a few months, suddenly its 1980. Then, the film continues in what feels like a few years, but when the end title cards come up, it says it's 1997. No one visually aged, and no time cards ever let me know what year it was. For those that already know the story, I'm sure they weren't confused, but it is confusing for those not familiar with it.<br />Still, 24 Hour Party People is really for those who were a part of that era, the fans of punk music. It's not a film I would eagerly sit and watch over and over, but those interested in this subject likely would. This one is highly recommend to 80s punk fans, and is worth checking out for those who love film experiments.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema. Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife. That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise. The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened. Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories. Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos. Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side. Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well. Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor. All in all, those looking for something delightfully different and intelligent should definitely give Memento a well deserved look.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I was certainly surprised about this one. About a Boy is a fantastic story paralleling the lives of a grown man (Hugh Grant) and a young boy.<br />Now, being no Hugh Grant fan, I thought his presence in the film would be a great distraction all the way through, even if the story was good. But Grant manages to become his character, a listless man living off the royalties of his father's one hit wonder. I forgot the actor and was tricked into seeing the character, and the results opened my eyes to a fantastic film.<br />What really makes this film work (aside from Grant's performance) is how it parallels the lives of Grant and the young boy, who keeps coming by his apartment uninvited looking for a father figure. Cutting from one shot of the boy doing or thinking (in voice over) one thing to Grant doing or thinking the same thing works splendidly. There are plenty of laughs, as well as feel-good moments in the film, without ever getting melodramatic or cheesy. It treads that fine line meticulously, and comes out a clear winner in the end.<br />The music is well placed amongst the visuals of the film. Instead of taking current pop hits picked for their popularity, the songs have a direct correlation to the plot and situations, combining music and visuals in perfect harmony. The supporting cast, including Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense) is equally fantastic.<br />The film is a complete joy from beginning to end. If you're tired of manipulative feel good (or feel sad) films, check out this refreshingly good movie. Highly recommended.
0375414932|5.0|this novel is so brilliant, so swiftly paced and poetically composed, i can hardly do it justice.  i have read (and taught in university courses) Boyd's books over and over again down the years (a fav is The New Confessions) and Any Human Heart rates right up there with the best work he's done.  there's a real melancholia evident here--so those who are looking for the hilarity of such early works as A Good Man in Africa or On the Yankee Station are gonna be puzzled a tad.  Logan Mountstuart is a great creation...so pleased, especially as i didn't like Armadillo and The Blue Afternoon--despite the fact that, with Ian McEwan, Wm Boyd is my favorite contemporary novelist.  get this as soon as you can...
B00005JLXC|1.0|To be honest I'm getting a little sick of these comic book movies, and the worst part is my friends don't care so I'm constantly being dragged to see these bad movies.<br /> If movies like \\"X-Men\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", & \\"Daredevil\\" had been released 10-12 years ago I would be having a blast at the movies, but that's not the case. And I'm not interested in comics anymore, and I don't remember the story-lines concerning the characters.<br /> One of the many reasons I didn't like \\"Spider-Man\\" was because I didn't feel Toby Maguire was a good choice for the lead. I don't think of him as a heroic leading man type, Affleck on the other hand is liked by the ladies so he stands more of a chance at pulling off the role despite the fact he has no talent as an actor. And in all honestly I could of liked this movie more than \\"Spider-Man\\" or \\"X-Men\\", but, here's why I didn't.<br /> First of all Affleck seems a bit to smug to me in this movie. He acts too much like a know it all. I didn't like his interruptation of the character. My second problem acting wise has to do with the \\"Bullseye\\" character played by Colin Farrell. A person I think has been OVER-used in Hollywood in just a short amount of time. Already in the past year has has appeared in \\"Minority Report\\" (Which is a good movie) and \\"The Recruit\\" (Another good movie) but here he plays \\"Bullseye\\" like a vilgilante gang member. Not at all what I was expecting this character to be like. I pictured the character to clearly be evil a little disturbed, but, smart, slick, sneaky and sly as a fox. Colin Farrell plays him like yes he's evil, insane, and a biker. Totally a wrong choice. But who's to blame? Farrell or the director? Also, I can't understand why Michael Clarke Duncan was chosen in his part. It all seemed wrong.<br /> I did some reading when I went home about the daredevil character. I read my old marvel comic trading cards and read that daredevil and Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner) meet while in college. Which doesn't happen in this movie. I also never read anything about daredevil's dad being a boxing, but, that may just be my fault. Going back to Garner though, she just isn't given a good role. Infact no one really is well written in this movie. And Garner doesn't really make the character believeable.<br /> I have one question for everyone, this was never explained in the movie, why does \\"Daredevil\\" sleep in water? That confused me.<br /> For those who liked \\"Spider-Man\\" and \\"X-Men\\" I really doubt you'll be coming out of \\"Daredevil\\" enjoying it. It's a film I think so far, is one of the worst of the year (and I'm sure that opinion will stick).<br /> Bottom-line: A silly poorly written comic book movie that didn't seem to bring it's characters to life, the way \\"Spider-Man\\" did. We really don't believe in what we're seeing. A missed chance at what could of been a good movie.happen in this movie.

B000002KKC|4.0|So how do you follow-up Rumours, one of the biggest albums of all time?  Well, with more of the same, of course.  As the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br />With Tusk, Lindsey Buckingham and Fleetwood Mac don't just break it, they beat it to a pulp and throw it over the ledge.  <br />Not that you would know from the first song.  &quot;Over and Over&quot; probably left listeners comforted thinking, &quot;Ah, more of the same.  In fact, it's even more easy listening.  I'll be hearing this song forever on the light FM stations.&quot;<br />Nothing can prepare the listener for the frenetic, goofy, and bizarrely produced &quot;The Ledge&quot;.  Definitely not a radio-ready song.  And from there the album launches into its' schizophenic concept. Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks's songs are for the most part enormously satisfying pop, while Buckingham's songs are vehicles for strange riffs, instrumentation, production, and lyrics.  If Rumours documented his break-up with Stevie, Tusk displays how breaking up with the love of your life can really play with your mind.<br />How weird is the production?  Listen to &quot;Not That Funny&quot; sometime by turning the spekaers all the way to the left channel, and then replay the song with the speakers all the way to the right.  One side sounds like a dumb, silly kids Casio, the other side has some of the dirtiest sounding guitar ever.  <br />If you're looking for a good, weird listening experience, forget your Frank Zappas, your Nick Caves, or Flaming Lips.  Becuase those are all examples of artists who retain a particular sound, and don't really ever venture outside and beyond it.  With Tusk, Fleetwood Mac proved themselves to be a much riskier, strange entity than anything that anyone - probably even THEY - could have realised.

B000002I25|5.0|This CD is soooooooo great! This is one of the first cds that i have ever bought. Every song on it is great so you don't have to keep skipping songs to find one you like. Even though I am only a teenage, i enjoy this CD as much as any old person who bought the vinyl when it first came out. This is a CD I suggest you buy!!
B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi is an audiovisual time capsule. It shows America at a time of great transition--with microcomputers, global outsourcing, and technology on the brink of relegating the American worker to obsolescence. Filmed between 1977 and 1982, Koyaanisqatsi takes place on the doorstep of automation. Throughout the film, and especially during \\"The Grid\\" sequence, we observe several examples of the outmoded 1970s economy: <br />1) Pontiac TransAms being assembled by factory workers. Car assembly has been mostly automated.<br />2) TVs being assembled by American workers. I can't name a single company that still manufactures TV's in the US.<br />3) Thousands of workers streaming from a Lockheed plant--a vestige of Cold War military build-up.<br />4) Letters being visually inspected by US postal workers. Text recognition technolgy has since automated this process.<br />Koyaanisqatsi contains many shots of corporations/businesses that are defunct or on the verge of bankruptcy. Examples from the film include:<br />1) K-Mart: the film contains two tracking shots of K-Mart cash registers. K-Mart filed for bankruptcy in 2001.<br />2) United Airlines: During \\"Vessels,\\" we view two UA 747-200s taxiing at LAX (accompanied by Philip Glass's sublime score). Today, UA is undergoing a massive corporate restructuring.<br />3) Chemical Bank: The Grand Central Station sequence contains a shot of Chemical Bank \\"Express\\". What ever happened to Chemical Bank?<br />I agree with the reviewer who claims that Koyaanisqatsi is an ode to-not indictment of-modern technology. However, most of what we see in the film, especially during \\"The Grid\\" sequence, is no longer modern by today's standards. During \\"The Grid,\\" we experience a spellbinding time-lapse ride along the Embarcadero Freeway in San Francisco, which was subsequently demolished in the name of new urbanism. For any fan of modernity (in the late 1970s and early 1980s sense), Koyaanisqatsi is essential viewing.
0780631684|4.0|Imagine that you unknowingly cheat death.  A group of teenagers do just that only we learn that death does not take kindly to being cheated.  As these teenagers begin to learn that they should have died and didn't they also begin to learn that Death hasn't forgot about them.  This movie is a interesting look at the idea of death.  The plot is good and the acting is not half bad.  Although the end of the movie may take one too many twists for you to keep up with.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|It's hard to believe most of the reviews on this website.  Levine's 1990 Ring is the most magnificent thing I've ever seen done on the stage, and the film is nearly flawless.  This production converted me to Wagner.  In a word, it is magnificent.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is an awsome CD. One of the few you can buy and listen to the whole things straight through. It's full of great energetic music and God, these girl can sing. It's my favorite &quot;get up and move&quot; CD. The lyrics are written quite well and their accents make their music even more unique. There's just something about these girls voices that makes you want to listen to more. I love this CD!
B00003CXCW|5.0|A must have for the old black and white classic movie buff! Interesting story, seems real to life story. Guy loses car; old has been starlet takes him in because he is a writer. In the end she dooms herself! I say the butler help build her fake reality world. The best thing on the DVD was the extra features, that showed a map where the main parts of filming were at and if the buildings or car is still their! Great commentary!
B0000203YT|3.0|Shakespeare in Love is a movie mainly designed for commercial success, as most movies are, but in this movie this point comes out very clearly. Even though that things don't fit in the plot, they are in the movie, because the viewers just expect them. This contributes to the flat storyline. <br />The target audience is definitely women. 80% of this movie is a sentimental lovestory. There are some funny dialogues and some intelligent turn points in the story, but they are clearly in the minority. Shakespeare would never like a movie like that. Action beneath the surface is not represented, but simple stereotype characters act in their typical way. Maybe women like that, just like they like BSB or NSync, but anyone who cannot stand these Boygroups won't enjoy this movie.

B000002MQ9|5.0|While Dead Can Dance's music was always more baroque and eclectic than the 'goth' label might suggest, _Within the Realm of a Dying Sun_ is certainly one of the more brooding entries in their back catalogue. Of their early material (which is to say, before the more overtly 'ethnic' stylings of _Into the Labyrinth_ onwards), this is by far the best. Making superb use of Lisa Gerrard's astonishing vocal range, it runs the full gamut from dark-and-langourous to soaring inspiration. As usual, Perry's vocal contributions take a little longer to get used to; 'Xavier' sounds like 80s pop, albeit DCD-style.<br />It also contains 'Cantara', which for me is Dead Can Dance's best single track, and a reason to buy the album in itself: a glorious, undulating kaleidoscope of sound that just begs you to turn up the hi-fi...
B00005JKHP|3.0|The Good Things<br />*Neat special effects.  Lots of cool models and lots of interesting imagery.<br />*Interesting story.<br />*Even though the characters seemed dull at first, they are all right.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very long and slow.  It resembles \\"2001:  A Space Odyssey\\" more than \\"Star Trek.\\"<br />*Decker and the bald girl (and possibly Spock) serve as the main characters, while Kirk and everybody else is subdued.<br />*Some inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise (like their God-awful uniforms...).<br /><br />This film is mildly interesting, but hardly does justice to the \\"Star Trek\\" universe.  It is probably better to see this as a different, original space opera than as a \\"Star Trek\\" film.
6305841861|5.0|Its nice to see a comedy with such wonderful pacing. The movie just keeps going and going. I never wanted it to end. Both the first and second films were hilarious, but humor wasn't the first films intention. I've always liked Bruce Campbell and this is where he shines brightest. Nothing can top the chainsaw, the sawed off shotgun, and how its summed up by one word: &quot;groovy&quot;
B00006RAKP|4.0|This 2CD plus bonus mini-CD set, released in a second straight Christmas season dominated by comprehensive classic rock reissues, aspired to be the final definitive statement on Elton John's 30-year reign atop the pop charts.<br />But despite a well-written essay and photographs, and an extra disc featuring duets with Luciano Pavarotti and Alejandro Safina (an unbelievably overwrought \\"Your Song\\") , this collection fails against Elton's three previously released best-ofs.<br />Elton's first such collection from 1974 remains one of pop/rock diamonds. He, songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, producer Gus Dudgeon (who with John coordinated this set) mixed fast and slow, hard and soft, pulling pop music and cultural influences left and right to create one of music's most fertile, creative five year success runs. Repeated here, songs from that collection are missing (\\"Border Song\\") or truncated (\\"Daniel\\" and \\"Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting\\") Moreover, \\"Friends,\\" among Elton's beloved songs, is missing and would have been a great value-add.<br />His second volume from 1977 chronicled his three years as the world's most popular singing star. Yet two #1 radio hits from that collection missed this set, his bombastic \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and his audacious, reggae-tinged take on the Beatles \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\\" Elton made those tracks from respective rock superstars his own, sealing his dominance of the era.<br />Elton's 1976-86 greatest hits collection, released by two different labels, covered his resurgent 80s career linked closely to the return of his piano-ballad style and acknowledgement from artists he influenced (everyone from George Michael to Guns n' Roses). Yet some remarkable songs from even that set (especially \\"Blue Eyes\\" and 1979's Thom Bell-produced \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love\\") are noticeable by their absence. Any would have formed a more compelling third disc than, say, 1990's flaccid Elton-Michael duet on \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.\\"<br />Even the artwork looks slipshod. The cover recreates a 70s pencil-style drawing on white cover, with dates (1970-2002) indicating a short life, not a long career Elton defiantly announced was \\"To Be Continued\\" on his 4CD box set. Yet its hard arguing with the songs here, most correctly chronicling Elton's gradual shift from camp rocker to soft rock balladeer to Broadway and film composer/ classical collaborator. This set is recommended for casual fans or those wanting one spot for Elton's biggest hits. But fans wanting to dig deeper into Elton John's music and the pop culture he epitomised are better served by the three individual sets.>Even the artwork looks slipshod.

B00005MNP7|5.0|Eat to the Beat, is a superb album, a fine follow-up to the mega selling \\"Parallel Lines\\". In fact, I'm surprised that \\"Eat to the Beat\\" wasn't as big, if ever there was an album of PERFECT POWER POP SONGS, this is it!!! Dreaming, Atomic, The Hardest Part and Union City Blues, are just incredible rock nuggets. Blondie did score 3 hits in the US & 4 in the UK with this release. Dreaming and Atomic, are without any doubt, 2 of the finest rock songs in history, Deborah Harry sounds amazing on the Super Sexy Disco back drop of \\"Atomic\\" and her Powerful vocals on \\"Dreaming\\" are unforgettable. With songs like \\"Shayla\\" and \\"Sound a Sleep\\" she is pure and intoxicating sweetness. The edgy and funky \\"The Hardest Part\\" is just awesome Blondie at it's best and sexiest, and should have been a mega hit, if it weren't for \\"Call Me\\" being a mega hit at the time of it's release in 1980. Eat to the Beat is a sturdy and healthy portion of fine New Wave Rock, from one of Rock's Ultimate Bands. From start to end, Eat to the Beat will have you singing and bopping around, and isn't that what music is all about.
B00005JG6R|5.0|This is a great movie full of colorful artistry and strong language. It has brief nudity and a strong violence content, which is great for those who love the True animation experience. I have owned this video for many of years and it is a part of my collection including Ghost in the Shell and Vampire D.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Parallel Lines is nothing less than a Masterpiece. Constantly ranked in the Top 100 best albums of all time, not to mention sellers of all time, some 21 million copies internationally by 2003. Blondie soared to superstar status not only on the music charts 1978-1979 with this album, but forever placed them as POP ICONS. Blondie are truly among rock music's elite. If ever there was a perfect POP/ROCK Album, Parallel Lines is it. In a time where 6 singles off 1 album was unheard of, Blondie did the unthinkable and rode the International charts. Deborah Harry is simply sweet as honey, on songs like &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; and &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; a UK #1 in 79. Although &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; was the 5th biggest sellling single in the UK in 1979, it was never released in the USA, but recieved a fair amount of FM airplay. Parallel Lines is not without it's edgy moments, as evident on songs like &quot;11:59&quot;, &quot;One way or another&quot; and &quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot;, we see Deborah Harry singing with frantic release. The world would forever be changed with the release of the Mega Smash &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;, without a doubt one of the 50 biggest rock songs of all time. The techno beat of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; sold millions of copies worldwide, hit #1 in the US/UK/CAN and some 19 other countries. The number #2 song of the year in the UK, Heart of Glass is still as vibrant a song today, as it was in 1979, fresh and still ultra cool. The technobeat of &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; inspires Dance music even today. Parallel lines rode the charts for 2 years and was the #9 USA and #1 UK best selling album of the year in 1979. Parallel Lines was produced by legendary producer &quot;Mike Chapman&quot;, who produced 3 other all time classics, all from 1979. Pat Benatar's &quot;In the heat of the Night&quot;, The Knack's &quot;Get the Knack&quot; and another 1979 BLONDIE album &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot;. Parallel lines is an outstanding album, full of intelligent and catchy lyrics, and great grooves. This album does not have a weak track on it, this is a consumers dream, full of value and rock history. Parallel lines is a Classic album in every sense.
B00006690G|4.0|i think this is a good album but some of the songs are a bit too boring but some are amazing like <br />1) sing for the moment<BR>2) cleaning out my closet<BR>3) white america<br />this albums good but not his best
B000000OYQ|4.0|First thing is first, I love Zeppelin, and I love Page. He was the man inspiration for me to pick up the guitar. Upon listening to this album I felt somewhat confused, why the hell did Page pick these singers?? Percy sounds ok... but just ok. The other two I could definitly live without. The only tracks that seem to work here are the instrumentals, the regular songs would have been good upon the choice of different vocalists. I personally think that Page should have made this a Page/Plant collaboration... it would have been that much better (though it would not have been possible at the time). Anyway, this is a pretty meat and potatos album. Very simple and to the point. Page shows he can still play the guitar like days of yore. I giving 4 stars though I would like to give 3 1/2 based on the vocalists that ruin their respective songs. When's the next Page solo album coming?
0316666343|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the book.  It's a great story...about a girl (Susie) who watches her family and friends from above trying to cope with her murder (and trying to deal with it herself)...but I had a hard time getting into the characters.  They were a bit dull to me (except maybe for the Grandmother)  The description of Susie's heaven was rather boring as well.  I think Sebold could have made this a little more interesting.  I also wanted to know more of what was going on in the head of the murderer...but we didn't get to spend much time there either.  The story itself was enough to keep me interested...and the ending was the best part (to me.)
B00008BXJG|5.0|Well we've all heard all the songs but this time we get to hear them newly remastered.  The remaster makes everything sounds so much more clear and it's a great improvment over the 1994 remaster release.  But the main reason to get these new releases is to see all the new artwork.  The linear notes are interesting to read and the new photos are spectacular.  If you're a die hard AC/DC fan like myself then you'll absolutly love the new Highway to Hell.
B000088E6M|5.0|I had never even heard of 50 cent, but I must say this album is banging.  I just put it on and let it play all the way through.  I would at least give it a listen, I'm sure you will get it once you hear it though.  All in all I'm happy with the purchase.
B000066NW0|5.0|i actually like this a bit more than michelle branch SPIRIT ROOM album. i don't care if her style is a punk or not, or if her tie is lame. the girl can sing and can carry the tune really well. and that's all that matters to me.

0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry creates a perfect world in her novel, The Giver.  With suspense, foreshadowing, and many other well-used techniques, Lowry paints a story of a young boy, Jonas, who is given the burden of becoming the next Receiver for his community.  The Receiver is the person who has to nurture all the memories of the world, from the past and present, yet not be able to share his discoveries with anyone else.   Jonas eventually becomes overwhelmed by this task, and persuades the Giver, the previous Receiver, to change the world, as they know it.  <br />Lowrys illustration of this Utopia is wonderful.  It forces the reader to think about the benefits and the problems of a perfect, uniform world. Lowrys precise writing leaves the reader pondering these questions: Is peace worth losing all color and beauty in a world?  Is unity worth losing all personal identity?  Are all utopias mind-numbing and monotonous?<br />Personally, I truly enjoyed The Giver.  It was an easy read, yet so full of questions and morals.  I thought the end was very abrupt, but it only added to the effectiveness of the book.  It made me think even more about the messages Lowry was cleverly trying to portray.
0553812173|4.0|The book is a little complicated in the beggining, Erikson doesn't start of in the beggining of the story. What he does is throw you in halfway through and lets you pick up on things fromt there. The easiest way to go about understanding the book is to just read it, most everything is explained later in the book, and while you might not believe it at first you will come to understand it and then you will be like, &quot;Holy cr@p, that makes sense&quot; and have a smile on your face. It is fun to go back and understand and it makes the book so much more enjoyable when the author doesnt waste half of his time talking about how the character looks. Had Erikson done this, the book would have been over 1000 pages but I loved it because I got to make the characters look like what I wanted, instead of the author forcing a look on me, and also because i didnt have to completely make a character up, he did it right in the middle. Over all, you just need to get past the first 200 pages or so and you will love it, things will start to make since and you will understand what everyone is doing. Until that point look forward to the bridgeburners PoV, they should be able to get you past the first 200 pages. Once there youll have amazing characters like Crokus, Rallick Nom, and last and definetly not least my favorite character- Kruppe. Just read it, youll love it!
B00000294R|5.0|Big L had some serious potential.  His rhyme style was unmatched back then.  Every track he comes off smoothly with wit and ill multi-syllable wordplay.  The only bad thing about Lifestylez, is that the beats aren't a fraction as dope as L's lyrics, but then again that's a good thing because it makes you pay more attention to his verbal wizadry than the beat he's terrorizing.  On this album you also get a sneak peak at two of today's biggest stars. For instance, Cam'ron (who used to go by Killa Cam) who rips it up on the ill posse cut, &quot;8 iz Enuff&quot;, which also features a not so well known, but definitely dope Uptown MC, Herb McGruff.  On &quot;Da Graveyard&quot; blesses us with a pre-Reasonable Doubt 'Really YOUNG' Hova.  If you are a fan of real hip-hop and dope mcing, this is a MUST HAVE to your collection.

B00005B36H|4.0|i love the sound on this album. the guitars have such an edge, and the production is just perfect. i thought anime was a hair weaker in the songwriting and undertow was not as adventurous. this album is my favorite tool album. the great thing about tool is that the music is its own language, seperate and different from the words. i thought this album, with songs like parbol & parabola, just hit the listener fast and leave you breathless. It would seem the band are becoming more prominent and they are relying less on voice. the arrangements are more sinister and complex and the band seems more confident to shine while maynard is not neccesarily taking a backseat but sharing the stage with his bandmates. the results are wonderful. <BR> with every album, tool combine the familiar with the experimental and they progress. they always move forward but they do not want to leave their fans out in the cold so they combine old familiar \\"things\\" to keep you safe and warm for the trip you take with them. i do not feel they re-tread old territory at all. this album is much more atmospheric. i felt undertow was too repititive. all songs sound too close in sound to each other. (they did better on anime)<BR> this album is such a gem. i adore it. everyone has their opinion and every tool fan has an opinion. they are not right nor is anyone wrong. it is all a matter of taste. give it a listen for yourself.
0553260111|3.0|I thought this book was OK, up until page 200 or so.  I became very busy at work, and did not read it for a while. I found the plot twists and innumerable characters in the book so confusing to get back into I did not finish the book.  Maybe one day I will pick it up again, but I really think there are better books I can spend my time with.
B00000099Y|4.0|tool are one of the best bands to come out in the last ten years. i love their dark edge, their superior music ability and astonishing songwriting ability. unfortunately, for me, i find that each song is a mix of greatness and too much too soon. i find, at times, are more musicians than songwriters. they are without a doubt, great musicians but sometimes i find the drums, when simple and tasteful, are at their best. the guitar chords sing and scream and it is in simplicity that they shine best. <BR> i find when everyone plays less but with more feeling, the total package is so intoxicating i fall down on myself. maynard's voice is one of the most distinct and striking voices i have ever heard and he sings and screams with equal merit. i love the tones and riffs the guitars dazzle me with. there are some magnificent songs but, i find they are diminished with overplaying. there are moments of brillinace and moments of not so greatness and moments that just canot be explined with mere words.  all in all a very intense but still 4 star xperience. <BR> tool, for those of you not familiar with their work, are a band of musicians. this translates into alot of progressions, musically. they start quiet, build loud and before its over they have changed moods many times. i find they use major instead of minor chords to give it a different feel. i, particularly, enjoy the guitar sound on this record as well as lateralus. it has more bite than earlier works. it is music with an edge. the drums are not your simple bass and snare combination. instead, you get complex beats using toms and off beats and odd timings to off set the music and jazz it up a little. i really think this is where they shine (all great bands, in my opinion, are great because they have a great drummer. tool are no exception) tool really stand apart from the pack.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Several years ago I saw Aronofsky's 'Pi' and was impressed with its style and intelligence. But I felt cheated because by concentrating on style he sacrificed opportunities to allow the audience to get lost in the story--which is, let's face it, why a lot of people go to films.  <br />That shortcoming is definitively rectified in this, the director's next effort.  Sure--this time he didn't have to start from scratch with the writing, he had Selby to work from. But he's managed to keep his stylistic brilliance and wit, even improve on it (e.g. the dilating pupils, jumping fridge and deafening teeth-grinding) and still provide a showcase for the actors & story.  Selby writes about addiction and that is a big theme of this movie.  But the story is really about tragic results when characters seek a better life for themselves and those they love, but their imagination of where to look for their dreams is limited to destructive spaces.  <br />About the acting: we all knew Burstyn is an exceptional actor, though sparsely seen lately; let's hope that changes.  But Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly *all* surprised me here.  I didn't realize they had it in them.  And (character) actor Christopher McDonald is brilliant as the real and hallucination versions of the pseudo-evangelical tv personality.<br />About the music: Clint Mansell did the amazing score and I even bought the soundtrack.  Kronos quartet's theme was used on trailers for The Two Towers last fall and always gives me goosebumps.<br />I see a lot of films and am hard pressed to think of ten that hung over me for days like this one did.  I'd rank it with some of my all-time favourites in the gutwrenching genre: Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and to a lesser extent Memento.
B00003CXFU|5.0|Wow!  This is not another Pretty Woman by any means.  Julia's character is a struggling mother who has no question in her mind as to the right and wrong of a whole town's situation, and she isn't afraid to hunt down the evidence and the answers she needs. Erin Brockovich is based on the true story of a woman at the end of her means who is scratching and clawing to keep from drowning while supporting her children, and saving a town.  Roberts does an exceptional job portraying Brockovich.<br />Kudos to both Julia for a job well done, and Erin for making her life what she wanted it to be, while helping those who couldn't have done it on their own.

Jerry never allowed his obesity, drug addiction, alcoholism, poor hygiene, or his tasteful relationship with \\"mountain girl\\" to deter him from producing music on the scale of Beethoven and Mozart. He could turn a three chord, twelve bar tune into a symphony of sound---like the music of the spheres! What a man! What a talent! I named my son \\"Jerry\\" because I want him to grow up to be just like the divine Mr. Garcia! What a role model for the youth of America!Bath, what bath? Shave? What's a shave? Diet? Are you kidding? ...
B00005JLO2|5.0|...I thought \\"the Four Feathers\\" was a fantastic movie. This movie offered a lot: romance, action, drama, etc....I love this movie!!!! The acting was great, the settings were great, good plot.... I am definitely going to add it to my DVD collection.
B000084T18|5.0|In a world with only decient cuts for rap these days 50 cent is in quite another direction.  This entire cd is a master piece from start to finish.  Many say 50 didn't live up to the hype but in my opinion he far surpassed it.  Many claim 50 doesn't have any depth but when listenin to tracks like \\"Many Men\\" you can't deny theres more than just cash, hos, and cars in this man's perspective.  At this time besides NAS there is no one more real than 50.  How many emmcees do you kno that have been shot 9 times and lived to talk about it?  While he has some strait up tight tracks like \\"What up Gangsta\\" \\"In da Club\\" and \\"Patiently Waitin\\". He also has many thought provoking tracks like \\"high all the time\\" and \\"Many Men\\".  This is the best out there at the moment.  This is one of those few cds that you never skip a track on.  The main point: cop this one, you won't be dissapointed.
0440237688|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Not only was it interesting but it was also an easy read.  In the beginning, it started of by giving some backround to the story and their beliefs of the community.  Then as the story goes on it shows how the boy learns that there is more to what he was brought up to know to be true.  Towards the end of the book, he becomes rebellious as he starts to realize the truth. The giver's job was to give the memories of life to the receiver who turned out to be Jonas our main character and with those he felt that everyone should have the memories that the giver has fed to him. The only part I did not like to well was the ending.  It was sort of a cliff hanger.
B00005JLSC|5.0|If you haven't seen \\"Chicago\\" yet you are missing out. Be sure to see it before the Academy Awards - and make sure you see it before it leaves the theater. Renee Zellweger gives the performance of a lifetime and you will fall in love with her character Roxie Hart. Catherine Zeta-Jones is amazing; her voice and dancing ability will \\"razzle dazzle\\" you. Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Richard Gere all give an extroadinary performance! You will leave the theater stunned and amazed. You cannot see this movie only once - so go see it soon!
B00007L4IA|3.0|Usually, whenever Hollywood shoots a remake of a previous film, the producers hope that the newer version will not be simply an update with some technological advances thrown in. They are likely to suggest that their remake emphasizes certain themes that were lacking in the original. The enduring success of the 1939 version of THE FOUR FEATHERS was clearly to be seen as an ideal melding of character and spectacle. Some forty years later, a new generation of producers updated the A. E. W. Mason story into a mess that was neither character nor spectacle. Then twenty five years after that, the newest generation of producers believed that they learned enough about the second version's debacle to enhance the lasting appeal of the original. Sadly, what director Shekhar Kapur has managed to accomplish is to emphasize the spectacle at the cost of the characterization. <br />What made the first version resonate in the minds of the audience was the credible metamorphosis of Harry Faversham from a mindset of self-inflicted cowardice to a continent spanning set of acts of self-sacrifice that nearly everyone--except oddly enough for Harry himself--saw as incredible heroic. Heath Ledger, as Harry, sleepwalks through a role that demands that he show far more inner turmoil than he does. One minute he is quite sure that as a newly minted lieutenant in the British Army he has no desire to serve. To Harry's credit, he justifies his refusal on the grounds that as the son of a former officer, he was expected to serve even if he had serious reservations. But if his moral qualms were strong enough to risk the censure of family, peers, and fiance, then he ought not have been so quick to shift gears and head for the Sudan where his regiment was beseiged by armies of the Mahdi, a radical Muslim fundamentalist who has sworn to rid his country of what he sees as the morally debilitating influence of Western ideology. It is not unlikely that with the recent ratchiting up of tension between a more modern version of radical Muslim ideology and a Western culture that rings as debilitating to extremists now as then that the producers would emphasize that aspect of the film. The problem with that is that in so doing, the film leaves the realm of entertainment to that of the filmed polemic. There is a scene midway through that updates the role of the suicide bomber. Just before Harry's regiment is attacked by the main body of the Mahdi's forces, a small detachment of Sudanese attack the British on horseback, even though they know that to do so is suicide. They are shot out of their saddles by accurate British rifle fire, much to the consternation of the ones shooting. It is impossible to view this scene as anything other than as a thinly veiled reference to the current crop of suicide bombers willing to die merely to kill the enemy. As Harry is watching this battle, he sets a tone for himself that he follows for the remainder of the film. He watches far more than he participates. In the first film with John Clements as Harry, Clements played Harry as one who does far more than he watches. That Harry took charge. Ledger's Harry had only a few scenes of face to face confrontation with the Mahdi's soldiers, and even then his actions are invariably accompanied by excessive histrionics. Of far more interest is his friend Jack, who defends Harry from the accusations of cowardice by their peers, but then has the great bad luck to fall in love with Ethne (Kate Hudson), who promptly dumps Harry as soon as she learns of his decision to resign his commission. <br />The major problem of this latest version of a man who is given four feathers as a symbol of his cowardice is that he does not really do enough to warrant being the focus of interest. One gets the feeling that Jack and the survivors of the British Army could have been served equally well by a local Sudanese (Dijmon Hounsou) who is one of the few characters whose credibility is established early on and runs trueto form until the closing credits. The ending is no surprise to those who have seen the earlier version. What may be of surprise is that those same viewers can rightfully conclude that as a film that was supposed to combine action with strong character, THE FOUR FEATHERS is as morally deficient as those white feathers that floated so symbolically and obtrusively throughout.
B000056NX5|4.0|Gale Edwards succeeds in liberating JCSS from the inspiration of HAIR and other time-locked musicals of the late 60s/early 70s era as memorialized in Jewison's dated film.<br />Musically more consistent then Jewison's version. The backing tracks are closer to the original 'soundtrack' (which is still the best for pure listening). This version lacks Carl Anderson's and Ted Neely's vocal tension, but makes up for it with the secondary characters (notably a Pilate and a Herod that improve greatly on the Jewison version). <br />The Jewison film was already dated when it first appeared in theaters--it had a tired, hippy dippy look that was an embarrassment to look at. <br />This version has a more modern avant-garde approach (portraying Herod as manic broadway impressario which is implied in the Superstar lyrics anyway and the use of Darth Vader like clothing for the Roman soldiers). This version is likely to be the filmed version that others have to top and it may be 20 years before someone attempts it. It does use sparse stage settings that school/community theaters are likely to use as either a model or inspiration for their own avant garde stagings that juxtapose 20th (or 21st) century elements with more traditional Roman elements.
B00005U1YO|3.0|I've seen nothing but rave reviews for The Chemical Brothers' latest album, and since I'm a fan of theirs, I decided to check it out. The album is good, but I don't think it's worth ALL the hype.<br />The album starts off great with the title track, which will make you want to do just that. Then you'll move on to the equally catchy \\"It Began In Afrika\\" and then my personal favorite, \\"Galaxy Bounce\\". Other tracks to check for are \\"The Test\\" and the change-of-pace \\"The State We're In\\".<br />The rest of the songs on the album aren't wack or anything, but they don't seem to stand out when measured against past CB jams like \\"Block Rockin' Beats\\" or \\"Setting Sun\\". Also, I think it would have been wiser to release one of the aforementioned standout tracks rather than \\"Star Guitar\\", which isn't as strong as some of the other songs.<br />There aren't necessarily any songs worth skipping on Come With Us, but it isn't classic material either. Still, there are enough good moments here for you to get your dance on.
B000002H70|5.0|I never cared much for The Cure or even knew one song but in an episode of 'South Park' when Rob Smith fights Barbara Streisand, Stan yells &quot;'Disintegration' is the best album ever&quot;, so I eventually picked it up and is great. Any miserable musician is fine with me but when they add hard work and talent it really pays off. Smith's voice can really shine in the Pink Floyd Roger Water mold. He picks his spots to add lyrics which shows how much he cares for the music. In 'Fascination Street' the best part is when he invokes 'Let's move to the beat' and he could have said this two or three times during the song but that would have watered it down for approval. None of that here, just an English band showing its genius.
014017821X|5.0|up until recently, i had heard ms. carter's name mentioned in conversation but i'm all the happier for having finally read a collection of her short stories. we've all heard about the adult fairytales which exist & many of us have even read a few here or other. whether you picked up one of anne rice's trilogies written under a pseudonym or found another author's collection of modern fables, you'd have to admit that almost all of us were intrigued by the grown-up fairytales at one point in time or another. well, i'd like to say for starters that i've read the anne rice books & a few others who have taken classic myths, legends, or fairytales & given their twist to the story but none of them have captivated me nearly as much as the bloody chamber has done. it's difficult to say which story perhaps is the best although i love the company of wolves. this having been my favorite film for nearly a decade, i was excited to see that ms. carter wrote the original short story as well as the screenplay. some of the others great stories which i love are ofcourse the book title, the courtship of mr. lyon which is simply gorgeous, & the tiger's bride. although i don't want to pidgeon hole her writing in any particular category but she remind me a bit of joyce carol oates or margaret atwood although i enjoy ms.carter's work a bit more i believe. her attention to detail is almost divine & the ironic humor here only makes the read that much more pleasurable. although not quite graphic, there are layers of sensuality are fleshed out on every page which are tastefully done so as not to offend too many readers.  although not excesseviley gory, her books are often steeped in violence which may not be suitable for all readers. excellent read highly recommended. it's a shame we no longer angel carter in the world of literature & i'm sure her writing is greatly missed by many.
0440237688|3.0|I liked reading this book. It was very easy reading and has some little brain teaser like ideas that make you think about things. I felt that Lois Lowry has some very interesting messages to share with the readers. I think it is a book that almost anyone would like to read.
B000002J1F|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Close to the Edge,\\" due no small part to Chris Squire's monstrous bass riffs and the vast array of quirky changes in the music.  \\"Fragile\\" preceded that album, but to me it seems like the more accessable of the two.  \\"Roundabout\\" is probably the clear cut example of that, with its success on radio, but overall, the songs on here are a bit shorter and more \\"organized,\\" that is to say, having memorable parts and fewer weird time signatures.  As usual, Chris Squire's bass playing totally floors me, being very loud and pronounced (he's probably the only bass player that uses a pick that I can really admire...sorry, I'm a die hard Jaco Pastorius/Cliff Burton/Roger Patterson fan, so I think finger picking rules!), but the drumming and guitar riffing on here really grabs me too.  I'd reccommend anyone who is new to Yes to pick up this album AND \\"Close to the Edge,\\" because both albums are totally fantastic, although \\"Fragile\\" would probably be the best choice for those not really into prog/art rock because of the catchier songs.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd is the best hardcore cd ever. I heard of them by a certain song called Spit It Out and I loved it. But afterwards I forgot about them and I was ordering cds from Columbia House and needed one more cd and got this. Once I heard it I was hooked. Well it really doesn't matter how much I like it b/c my mom  took it away from me b/c i was only 10 and she won't give it back. Later
B000000WG4|5.0|I love the film the Exorcist, so after hearing the creepy sounding \\"Tubular Bells\\" often and having them conjure up feelings of cold autumn days, I really had to check out the album behind the film, at least so that I could have something to frighten people.  What I found was something more beautiful and complex than I could have ever expected.  The music took on a beautiful, rather than \\"creepy\\" quality after having heard this several times through.  Its amazing what Mike Oldfield has created here--its as if he has created modern classical music.  The music goes through so many different changes and moods, complete with fantastic musical ideas and playing, that you'd never guess it was all played by one man.  How did he do this?!<BR>  The first part is the Exorcist theme we all know and love, but there's way more to it than that.  I actually prefer the second movement to the first, because it builds nicely and features the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  The part I'm talking about is the after the wierd cookie-monster death metal vocal part, at about 16:30, before the Irish pub music.  Whenever I hear that part it seriously takes me away to somewhere beautiful.  GODLY!!!  Just this part is worth $[amount].  Seriously.<BR>  Now, the few flaws.  The cookie monster part is just really weird, interrupting the lovely flow of the second movement.  There's a few other parts too, that may seem out of place, but if you remember that this is supposed to be a symphony to water, the whole piece does represent the spectrum of changes in water.  <BR>  This is simply a masterpiece of music.  I don't know where you'd be able to categorize it.  It needs to be heard, enjoyed, and respected.  I've never heard any of Oldfield's other stuff, but this is beyond words.  Godly, masterpiece, genious, all can be used to describe this, but you won't get the full idea unless you listen to it with an open mind.
0060537639|4.0|First and foremost, 1421 is a great read.  This book is interesting, written with passion, and will make you think.<br />I felt the best thing about 1421 is the job it did on why Zheng He and the Ming Dynasty fleets were shut down, dismantled, and records destroyed.  Menzies answers this question much better than Louise Levathes in &quot;When China Ruled the Seas&quot; and Tsai in the new biography of Zhu Di.  Menzies talks not only about the monetary and human costs of maintaining such a large fleet, but more importantly ties it into the Mandate of Heaven and the Dynastic cycle.  Menzies shows how something like a lightening strike and a fire can be seen as losing the Mandate of Heaven and thus a reason to change your ways.<br />Now its pretty much undisputed that the Chinese made it to the Southern Tip of Africa.  This is in the standard history books, the question is did they reach north and south america and australia like Gavin Menzies asserts.<br />The bottom line is based on one book, we can not answer this question.  Menzies makes a strong case, a case that makes you think, but its not a slam dunk or a closed case.  I think it will take more time and more historians and archeologists to answer that question.<br />The evidence is interesting.  Plants in north and south america that came from Asia, language, DNA, animals.  Almost a columbian exchange from China.  The discussion of maps, wrecked ships, journals, Menzies knowledge of the seas.  All make for a good case, but I need more.<br />I highly recommend this book.  Think about its conclusions and let's see where this all leads.  I also recommend reading this along with Blue Latitudes by Tony Horwitz which is about Captain Cook.  Think about all that Zheng He and Cook accomplished.  Two incredible, larger than life, and all to human heroes of history.
B000002J1B|4.0|After reading many conflicting reviews of this album I decided that I just had to check out this contraversial masterpiece.  What can I say?  Is it really the Spinal Tap-esque &quot;free style jazz escapade?&quot;  Is it noisy?  Yes and no.  There is definatly a lot of self-indulgent and/or acid inspired noisy segments on here, but it does take place over some rather complex fusion.  &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; is actually a really great song, with only the weird parts between the eight and twelve minute mark producing any minor discomfort to my ears.  The ending is TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL.  The only thing more beautiful than that I've heard is the mellow section at the end of Mike Oldfield's &quot;Tubular Bells: Part 2&quot; after the 16:30 minute mark, and before the Irish pub music kicks in.  The rest of the track is definatly Yes, just with a lot of different changes going on.  Its like they've gone totally manic or something.  &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; is the masterpiece of this album, and had there only been this song on here, I would have given it five stars.  Which leads us to the other two songs...not nearly as impressive!  I found them to be pretty demented, to say the least.  Seriously.  Quasi-happy, but very demented.  I don't listen to them very often, needless to say.  If you like catchy songs, AVOID THIS ALBUM!  If you enjoyed &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (the song) and Oldfield's &quot;Tubular Bells,&quot; (&quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; is quite similar to that piece in the sense that it goes through many moods while featuring some pretty ridiculous parts), you'll be floored by this!  I certainly was.  Oh, yeah, let's not forget the Chris Squire's bass playing rules.
1577311523|5.0|I find it intriguing how this book has garnered many responses at opposite extremes -- either people loved it, or they hated it. I have to admit that when I first picked it off the bookshelf, I put it right back. To look at things from the perspective that my mind could be my own worst enemy was, to say the least, quite intimidating. <br />But being the counselor I am, I recognized a response in myself that I see all the time in therapy: the \\"don't go there\\" shutdown clients sometimes go into when you get too close to the root of a problem. <br />Eckhart Tolle \\"goes there\\". He reveals the mind for what it truly is. No, it's not something we need to get rid of, and in fact it helps us immensely in the appropriate situations. But the problem is, it often takes over. It drowns out the Real You with its incessant chatter. It runs amok and is capable of causing all sorts of misery. Only if you can see through this, and recognize the mind for what it truly is, can you break through and find enlightenment. <br />It's not easy to accept. No one said the truth was easy. But if you are ready for it, Eckhart Tolle and The Power of Now definitely deliver the truth. Face it if you dare, and watch your life change for the better. I highly recommend this fascinating book.
B00004I9VE|5.0|This is a fantastic album...I don't need to say anymore about it. As for the SACD, it is very well done. I wish it had been in multichannel, but oh well. The high sounds are much clearer, without that digital sheen; the drum intro to Billie Jean actually startled me with its harsh sound. This is a result of the original eq, not the SACD. The sacd is much more &quot;present&quot; than the cd, somehow the soundstage is better although the mix is identical to the cd. I have to counter an earlier review: very few of the sounds on this album are digital, only sounds from the two digital synthesizers used (like the intro to Beat It). Most of the sounds are analog synths. By 'digital' the review may have meant synthesized. But hey, it was the 80s. The only downside to the SACD is that it brings out the flaws and harshness of old 80s signal processing, like the reverbs and such. Oh well, a great album and good SACD.
B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth decided to push all the boundaries and explore diverse styles, while still staying true to their melodic thrash metal roots, with their fifth album SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES (not based on the Ray Bradbury book of the same name).  You get a little bit of everything from Iced Earth's classic metal sound on this release, from introspective ballads, to powerful thrash blasters, and even some progressive territory in the form of the magnificent three-part &quot;Something Wicked&quot; suite that closes the album.  Although THE DARK SAGA and HORROR SHOW are infintely superior albums in my humble opinion, SOMETHING WICKED is a great album in its own right, even if it does take a few listens to fully appreciate.<br />&quot;Burning Times&quot; kicks things off with a meancing start, sounding like a lost Black Sabbath song with better vocals.  The three ballads - &quot;Melancholy (Holy Martyr),&quot; &quot;Watching Over Me,&quot; and &quot;Blessed Are You&quot; - are all very good and provide a nice change of pace.  I'm still getting used to &quot;Blessed Are You&quot; however.  I know it's a song for the fans, but the lyrics are kind of sappy and corny.  Anyway, that's just me.  &quot;My Own Savior&quot; is a riff-heavy monster filled with attitude and a clever, self-affacing chorus, and &quot;Reaping Stone&quot; just flat out rocks with a moody bassline and slinky guitar riff.  &quot;1776&quot; is kind of like an Iron Maiden instrumental for the new millennium, and I love the little flute solo towards the end.  It gives it a decidedly patriotic feel.<br />The highlight of the record is the aforementioned &quot;Something Wicked&quot; trilogy, which perfectly showcases Jon Schaffer's creative songwriting abilities.  Matt Barlow really shines on this epic, going from soft-spoken vocals, to ferocious growls, and high-pitched wails to really set the mood.  &quot;Prophecy,&quot; the first part, is very ominious and foreboding with some really excellent bass work from James MacDonough.  &quot;Birth of the Wicked&quot; (part 2) is the best of the thrash songs, with a chorus that will rattle in your mind for days.  The finale &quot;Coming Curse&quot; begins with a spooky piano intro before erupting into a full-on metal assault.  I won't describe any details in the story, but it is very well-written, and Schaffer plans to continue the story on a new IE concept album due out in 2005.  Can't wait for it now!<br />SOMETHING WICKED is a killer metal album, and shows that IE have never failed to do no wrong.  It's not my favorite IE album, but it's still good nonetheless.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This must've been the opportunity of a lifetime for Howard Shore and obviously the producers knew what they were doing when they picked him to score the trilogy.  He can produce the power and depth without being too heavy-handed, like say... someone whose name starts with Danny. ;o)<BR>I was, surprisingly, most pleased with the more solemn tracks (partial or whole).  Evenstar, Breath of Life, The Leave Taking, Forth Eorlingas and Isengard Unleashed are my favs.  The scenes between Aragorn and Arwyn along with their accompanying tracks are incredibly moving... still brings me to tears.  <BR>Unlike some, I'm not so STUCK on the LOTR-FOTR soundtrack that I'm unable to &quot;hear&quot; this one. However, I'll have to agree with the poster that said something to the effect of the final track (Gollum's Song) sounding like a Bond track on sedatives... Yes it has great lyrics, but it just didn't work for me. Otherwise, this is one of the best soundtracks ever.  Put on a pair of quality headphones to really hear Shore's rich textures and melodic subtleties.
B00005YUPO|2.0|Regrettably, Baby Bach just doesn't have the infant-mesmerizing magic of the Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart DVDs. The toys are not very interesting, many are static, and many seem to be there only to sell more toys.

B000089CJI|4.0|The postal service is a pairing of James Tamborello (Dntel, Figurine) with Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie). Tamborello makes the beats and Gibbard does the singing. Basically, the sound here is very reminiscent of homogenic-era Bjork, with click beats and some minor four-on-the-floor bass thumps. Gibbard throws down some his best melodies in years although he stumbles a bit lyrically. The lead single, \\"Such Great Heights,\\" is a wonderful combination of electro and indie, as is \\"the District Sleeps Alone Tonight.\\" There is a certain amount of monotony to the album, as some of the tracks start to sound the same after awhile, but the relatively short run time keeps things from getting too stale. <br />As a fan of both Dntel, Figurine, and DCFC, I thoroughly enjoy this album and would recommend it to anybody. If you like the \\"dream of evan and chan\\" from last year's \\"Life is Full of Possibilities\\" album then you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLSC|4.0|The Twenties aren't the only thing roaring in this silver screen remake of the Broadway hit of the same name.  \\"Chicago\\" roars with energy and verve, with nearly every scene exploding with attitude like a grenade.  Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are just dynamite as Roxie and Velma, two women who have been nabbed by the law for offing the men who did them wrong.  Hoping to beat the murder rap, they take sides with the town's most prestigious lawyer (a vibrant Richard Gere), and from there begins a storyline involving crime, greed, scandal, and the shameless pursuit of fame.  But the film's revelation is Queen Latifah's supporting role as the prison's Matron Mama.  Her sultry rendition of \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" will immediately end any doubt as to whether she deserved her Academy Award nomination.  But props have to go to Zellweger and Zeta-Jones, who tear up the screen at every musical number they perform.  The voices are on point, and the choreography is breathtakingly alive.  \\"Chicago\\" isn't going to make us forget about, say, \\"West Side Story,\\" but it's good enough to give you a jolt of energy.  And considering the sad state Hollywood is in, that's saying a lot.
0316666343|5.0|When I read the description of this book it really intrigued me, but I was afraid it would be morbid. I was very surprised on how the characters drew me in to their lives. It is not so much about the murder of a young girl but how her family and friends cope with the tragedy of losing her, and how she deals with heaven. Over the years she watches over her loved ones and follows the murder investigation. She sees her siblings growing up and her parents dealing with the pain. But what I found most interesting was Alice Sebolds vision of heaven. And how she developes the character of the girl in heaven. I was very content with the ending, and if they ever make a movie of the book,I hope they don't change it. A very thoughtful read.
031286504X|5.0|Our protagonist has a problem; everyone is a flesh-eating vampire but him. Sound familiar?  It ought to if you watch horror films: Vincent Price acted in a film based on this book, called 'The Last Man On Earth', and George Romero gives this film credit for an inspiration for 'Night of the Living Dead'.  later, Charlton Heston starred in 'Omega Man' based on the same book.  In fact, many later zombie, end of the world, and vampire films owe homage to this book.<br />Richard Matheson provides a delightful and sometimes terrifying read as he weaves his dark world where death and decay is the rule of the day, and the man-of-the-hour doesn't enjoy the role in which he's been placed.  Plague has spread everywhere, affecting everyone aside from Robert Neville.  His neighbor from hell, Ben Cortman, leads the neighborhood vampires, always trying at night to eat Bob.  His days are filled with shopping from a degrading food supply, building weapons, and killing sleeping vampires. His nights are filled with an incessant and nightmarish attack on his abode by said vampires, who are after his blood.<br />This book deserves to rest on your shelf next to Dracula, Frankenstein, Poe and Lovecraft.
B00001U0DP|4.0|I agree with what many of the other reviewers have written.  This movie remains one of my favorites because of the romance and comedy, as well as the brutal realism.  The first time I watched it it was hard to get into, partially because I watched the dubbed version.  I think hearing the actors' real voices adds so much emotion and inflection that isn't captured in the dubbing.  It is a sweet look into the Italian culture, romance, as well as a glimpse of the tragedy of the Holocaust from the perspective of those who were most affected by it.  I personally don't think it ever would have worked, to fool a child like that, children are more perceptive than any of us would think.  But that's when you turn around and say \\"it's just a movie.\\"  It was a very well-done movie that touched my heart.
0553801511|4.0|A few nice surprises and the plot seems to be moving along.
6304383177|5.0|This is a terrific, old fashioned, madcap, screwball comedy. Deftly directed by Howard Hawkes, the pace is frenetic from the get-go and never lets up. Starring Cary Grant, as a straight-laced paleontologist, and Katherine Hepburn, as an impulsive and beautiful heiress, this film is simply about as good as comedy gets.<br />The plot itself is simple. David Huxley (Cary Grant), a noted paleontologist, is trying to get a philanthropical grant of money for his museum from a wealthy donor. In his quest for this charitable gift, he runs into Susan (Katherine Hepburn), who, unbeknownst to him, is the niece and prospective heiress to his potential philanthropist's fortune. Once David meets up with this madcap heiress, his life will never be the same.<br />The film is noted for its highly improbable situations, its rat-a-tat-tat, stacatto delivery of lines, its frenetic pacing, and impeccable comedic timing. Toss in a missing dinosaur bone, a little dog with a fondness for such, a domesticated leopard (if there is such a thing), a not so tame leopard, a great cast and script, and voila, one ends up with a great film!<br />Cary Grant is marvelous as David Huxley, the straight-laced, befuddled man of science who is drawn into improbable situations by Susan. Katherine Hepburn is sensational as Susan, the airhead heiress whose hair-brained ideas just lead to trouble. Of course, Susan falls for David, and the games begin. In addition to Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, the film has notable performances by Charles Ruggles, as big game hunter Major Applegate, Barry Fitzgerald as the hapless hired hand, Mr. Gogarty, and Walter Catlett, as Slocum, the criminally stupid town constable.<br />It is with good reason that this film made The Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 best comedies ever made. It is an assessment with which I heartily concur. This is a superlative, vintage film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!

0440180295|5.0|The best word to describe this book is Excellent, capital E intentional. This book comes in a time of Vonnegut's writing career where he was both a great teacher and a great artist. This is a culmination of those teachings, put together in a uniquely artistic manner.<br />The story is an anti-war exploration of the meaning of life. Rather, as the back covers proclaims, it is an odyssey through time. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, hops back and forth among his memories (in time) in an effort to put together the fractured reality which exists there. Along the way, Vonnegut creates resonances which make for superb reading. I don't think I overstate the case when I call it brilliant.<br />Pilgrim, in this odyssey, finds that time does not proceed linearly, as we perceive it. Time merely is. If an event exists, it always exists since there is no past, present, nor future. Pilgrim learns this when he is abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Another tidbit he learns is that war is unavoidable. However, war doesn't exist in every moment in time, so the Tralfamadorians choose to visit those moments when there is no war.<br />On one hand, this is an absurd statement for an anti-war book. If Pilgrim finds that war is inevitable, how are we to believe we can avoid situations like Dresden? I don't think this is Vonnegut's message, exactly. Tralfamadorians choose to spend their conscious time in moments when war isn't. Since we live linearly, we should likewise choose to exist in moments when there is no war. If we could, most of us would choose to spend our time in moments of peace. So perhaps war is inevitable, but we don't need to live through it right now.<br />It's hard for me to imagine anyone who wouldn't like this book. I suppose if you were too young to understand, it may be unthrilling. Aside from that, you can assume that war hawks will dismiss it as gibberish, since Vonnegut does not portray war as glorious. As strange as it sounds, Vonnegut would probably call it gibberish too. <br />An excellent book, even if it is gibberish.
0060523794|4.0|REVIEW:  This book falls into the standard popular management/business book category for the mass market similar to the book published about a year earlier by another retiring prominent CEO of a large multinational company, &quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot;.  However, there are significant differences between the two and the main differences are reflected in the titles.  As the titles suggest, &quot;Jack&quot; is more of an autobiography told in a very opinionated manner whereas Gerstner's book is more about the company during Gerstner's years and how (in broad terms) the company transitioned to a more flexible, entrepreneurial organization.<br />The book is organized into five parts: (1) Gerstner's beginnings at IBM, (2) Strategy, (3) Culture, (4) Lessons Learned, and (5) Observations.  The first four parts are mostly about IBM and the transformation whereas the last section is mostly about Gerstner's views on industry, society, journalists, etc.  I highly enjoyed sections 1-4 but felt section 5 didn't really fit the book purpose and it seemed almost as though the editor/publisher convinced him to add the section in order to make the book the standard size.  The problem with section 5 is that Gerstner's states clearly that he believes the book should be about IBM and the turnaround, but section 5 is a half hearted attempt to give some personal musings about miscellanious things that at best seem like good political opinions and at worst sound like whinings.<br />However, excepting section 5, I got more out of this book more than Welch's.  Gerstner clearly tries to lead the reader to greater understanding of the IBM situation, the thinking behind the decisions that were made, and the resulting turnaround.  He does this in a style that doesn't suggest his answers are universal ones.  He recognizes that imparting better understanding rather than the right answers is the appropriate goal for helping others to achieve better results in complex environments.  Thisbook probably doesn't deserve a permanant place on your bookshelf (i.e. it is unlikely to be a classic), but if your looking for better understanding of the IBM turnaround or of large business in general, this is a good book to read.  If your looking for a better understanding of an individual CEO read Welch's book.<br />STRENGTHS:  Written in the standard style of popular business books so it has fairly short chapters and is easy to read.  Doesn't try to espouse too much theory or universal answers.  Does a good job at explaining why certain decisions were made and certain strategies selected.  Doesn't get bogged down in stock prices and financial data.<br />WEAKNESSES:  Section 5, Gerstner's observations I thought was off target and weaker than the remainder of the book.  Little insight into Gerstner himself (but that wasn't the book's intention).  Some sections were a bit too brief and could've used additional detail.
B00006AW2S|5.0|This release has stood the test of time, as have the Stones!  The group records more of their own original material from this point on and rarely look back.  Fans get Satisfaction - an anthem of the band's to this day, as well as many other fine tracks!
0812550706|5.0|There are certain books that seem as though they change your way of thinking, your opinions and reactions to the world around you.  In many ways, Ender's Game does just that, and it does it without being obvious.<br />There are over a thousand reviews posted here, so I don't think I need to tell the storyline here, most of you already know it.  What is important to note is how the storyline is nothing but a diversion.  What is at the heart of this book is human nature; why we do what we do and think what we think.  Many of us relate to Ender, to his isolation and his feeling that he just isn't the same as those around him.<br />Orson Scott Card offers several dichotomies here, and Ender himself is nothing but an exercise in duality.  This works.  I've read this book half a dozen times and have used in in my college English curriculum.  It had that much of an effect on me.<br />Many of my students reject the sci-fi element of the book in the beginning but almost all of them come to a point where they appreciate what this book has to say.  <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is amazed at the workings of human nature.  It doesn't portend to have all the answers, but it certainly will make you think, and you'll enjoy the process.<br />This is destined to be a classic, if it isn't one already.
1891252089|3.0|First the positive -- a good review of basic yoga principles, good pictures, and the coil binding.  I bought the book for a) the good reviews, and b) frankly, the coil binding.<br />The not-so-positive has more to do with me than the book -- if you're a rank beginner like myself, get this book once you're comfortable with the basic poses and have begun to put together a home practice.  I had only taken a couple of drop-in Ashtanga classes before I bought this book.  I reviewed it from cover to cover when I got it over a month ago, and haven't cracked it since because I was so intimidated.  I've since signed up for a beginner class, where I can get some direct feedback and learn alternate poses (to be fair, Swenson does offer alternatives), and also to get a better sense of the flow of yoga and absorb some of the gestalt.  You can't get that from a book.  I'll probably return to this book once I figure out what I'm doing, and what place yoga has in my life.
6305171769|3.0|\\"Halloween H2O\\" takes place twenty years after the events in the original \\"Halloween\\".  Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this installment as Laurie Strode.  She has faked her own death and is now head mistress at Hillcrest, a private school in California. She also has a seventeen-year-old son named John (Josh Hartnett).  Each Halloween, Laurie is forced to remember the events of twenty years earlier, but this year proves different from previous ones; Michael has returned.  After breaking into a nurse's house in Illinois and obtaining information on Laurie, Michael has made his way to Laurie's school.  Once there Michael goes on another killing spree while trying to find Laurie.<br />I thought this movie was good, but not nearly as good as the original.  This movie did have some good parts, and some of the scenes were good, but I was left wanting more at the end.  Also, this is a very short move (only about 80 minutes), and I think the producers could have done a better job if they would have made it a little longer.  On the plus side, it was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis back in the Halloween series, and she does give a good performance, as does Josh Hartnett.<br />I'm sure that horror movie fans will like this movie, just don't expect anything like the original.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera has one thing that separates her from all other pop stars. She has a voice. And a pretty damn good one at that. The title, \\"Stripped\\" is a very fitting one indeed. Sure, a lot more of her clothes came off to make this album, but the title refers to herself, as a person, stripped for all to see. This album gives a lot of insight to her life, past and present, and all the troubles she had to endure. The first single, \\"Dirrty\\" was probably the albums one weakness, and caused me to omit the fifth star. But I do not condem her for that. She was just expressing herself as an individual. As for the second single \\"Beautiful\\", was just that. The song \\"Infatuation\\" was very unique sounding, not quite like others she has done before. \\"I'm OK\\" had very expressive lyrics and \\"Singing my Song\\" was meaningful as well. All in all, this album has many levels, expressing Aguileras innermost thoughts and hidden past. Her voice is magnificant and though her image to some may be trashy or slutty, I think she's a girl who knows what she wants, proven in this exemplary album. Even if pop music isn't you cup of tea, Aguilera isn't the same \\"Genie in a Bottle.\\" This album is worth buying.
B00007BK2N|4.0|I dont have much knoledge about the early 80's rave scene besides what i gathered from this film. If what i have seen in this film is accurate, then Tony Wilson is probably the most important figure in dance music. He is the true genius behind all the raves and mega clubs all around the world. In his own words (in the film) he says &quot;This is it..the begning of rave culture...this is where people started to Applaud the DJ, not the musicians, the DJ...they are applauding the Medium...&quot;. This is an important film.<br />Stylistically this movi is crazy!...cinematography, in this film is very remnicent of Human Traffic or Trainspotting. All the elelments that made those 2 movis classics are present in this one....thick cockney accents, intelligent dialogues, an amazing soundtrack and beautiful images of post industrial england. Steve Coogan's (who plays Tony Wilson) acting is absolutely superb and he displays this ingenius nattative style in the film...he fits right into his role...no other person could have done it better. Because his acting is so good ...he overshadows the other actors and that works both against and for the film. The story is clearly divided into two distinct parts...the rise and the fall of Factory Records(Tony Wilsons lable...to which New Order and Happy Mondays were signed to) and the Hacienda (the club night that turned into its own club...some of the earliest raves happened there). The &quot;Rise&quot; part of the film is absolutely distorted and crazy...true to the ethos of that perticular time. But i do feel it could have been done a little bit better. &quot;The Fall&quot; part of the film is done in a much better manner. You can accuratelly access what actually happened. <br />In the special features of the DVD there is a small section called &quot;Manchester the Movi&quot;. In that section sombody says (a Happy Monday member i think) Elgland has &quot;Lock Stock...&quot;, Sheffild has &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, Edinburgh has &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, Cardiff has &quot;Human Traffic&quot; (ok he dint mention Human Traffic...but i feel he should have...) and now finally Manchester has &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. Tony Wilson loved the city of Manchester and that is clearly evident in the film.<br />I would like to think there is going to be another film for &quot;Bristol&quot; the city Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky put on the map...hopefully one day it will happen.
B000066NW0|2.0|After hearing many great things about this 'new' artist, Avril Lavigne, I figured to spend the extra 12 bucks to buy the C.D. But after listening through it, plus seeing her many &quot;in your face&quot; T.V. and magazine appearances, I was very confused by her image. One minute I'm listening to the very anti-preppy, punk rockish &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and the next minute I'm listening to the very popish &quot;I'm With You&quot;. Sure she writes her own lyrics, and I will give her credit for that. But then when you hear a song like &quot;I'm With You&quot; and dont even know what she's singing about it becomes a bit agrivating. Though she says she's been called the &quot;Anti-Britney&quot; or the &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot;, I find this album to be very poppy and I was hardly impressed. Her voice is nothing special and her image is way off. I do not reccomend this C.D. to anyone who is a punk or rock music fan.
B0000584V3|5.0|Now i love death metal...bands like vader, hate eternal, nile, eternal lies, in flames, soilwork, and death. I like Black Metal..dimmu borgir, cradle of filth, burzum, and dark funeral. <BR>Yes, i even like some regular metal...mushroomhead, mudvayne, and disturbed(though not as much). But Opeth is different from all of these bands and gengres themselves. This is art that is hard to put into any category. The brilliance of this album(and all there albums)is hard to put into words. It just goes down deep and touches you in a way that other bands just can't do...they can't even come close. Its aggressive, emotional, passive, and blends together perfectly. This is a band for the true music lover. Its definitely not for linkin park, blink 182, sum 41, and chevelle geeks. If you just like aggressive or just like only mellow music, this is not for you. If you like true musical art, or would like to hear it. Opeth is for you. Blackwater Park is the best album by them. Deliverance comes in second. Because this music is soooo \\"advanced\\" it may take a couple listens for you to get the full essence. take care!
B000002MP2|5.0|the problem with most punk bands today is that their music becomes too pop. They forget what they are in music for and become sellouts. This is the case with some bands like blink182 and Good Charolette who at first had a very punk tune but then they changed. Greenday has always stayed the same. The same type of music, the same meanings behind each of the songs. Thats what i like about them. this cd is my all time favorite greenday cd. With great songs like basket case and longview. I suggest that if you are sick of the bands that turn to &quot;pop-punk&quot; that you buy this cd.
B000088E6M|5.0|This Album got to be the best of the year.  50 Cent is doing his thing.  If u dont got it u better cop it
B000089CPF|4.0|Joey Burns and John Covertino's Calexico was pretty much written off as a sun-baked side project until their sophomore release, The Black Light, appeared on the scene. Taking its cue from Cormac McCarthy's heat-warped perspectives of the American Southwest, the record was neon tumbleweed tequila music that floated above an undercurrent of violence with cinematic grace. It was a major step forward in defining the band's sound and served notice that they would not be following the spaghetti-western chuck wagon. Instead, the album celebrated the magically real convergence of culture that occurs in the borderlands, explicitly linking their name and physical geography to a musical one.<br />Calexico's third release, The Hot Rail, continued to expand on this formula. It was an album that unfolded with a filmic fluidity to reveal desert noir folk singers and Technicolor mariachi bands playing for pretty girls throwing flowers and men sharpening knives. Not surprisingly, it was their most successful record to date.<br />Feast of Wire may soon change that, as the band once again ups the ante by widening their scope of sound. Cool West Coast jazz, eerie string sections, and dub are added to the storytelling folk, mariachi horns, kitschy border ballads, and sun-cracked soundscapes that rounded out previous efforts. If that sounds like a handful, it's because it is. Lesser talents wouldn't be able to hold it all together, but Calexico seamlessly blends these disparate parts into one of their most satisfying listens yet.<br />Sure, with so much to hear and such a range of styles, the album can take a couple of listens before it starts to bloom. That said, after these requisite spins, one can't help but admire how smoothly Feast of Wire glides from track to track, style to style. As on past albums, the band does an excellent job sequencing the record by situating slower instrumental passages between the more traditional songs. These musical bridges help bind the album together and create a total listening experience that is becoming increasingly rare today. For example, after the Marty Robbins-influenced border ballad \\"Across the Wire,\\" the band segues into \\"Dub Latina,\\" a trippy, melodica laced instrumental which in turn flows into the rousing \\"Guero Canelo\\" with its speak and spell rapping and ebullient background singers. It's a heady mix, and though the three songs couldn't be more different, they end up making a wonderful suite within the record.<br />Likewise, the gothic, string-laden \\"Black Heart,\\" which is unlike anything the band has done before, dissolves into pulsing synths at the beginning of \\"Pepita\\" before ushering in a multitude of beautifully picked acoustic guitars and a forlorn-sounding pedal steel. The disturbingly pretty pop song \\"Not Even Stevie Nicks ...\\" immediately follows, telling the tale of a man driving his car off a cliff and being found later, \\"in the motor.\\" I guess if the Gold Dust Woman can't help, there's no point in thinking about tomorrow.<br />And while Feast of Wire continues to reveal new sounds at every turn, the most surprising track on the album comes near the end when the band falls into the cool jazz of \\"Crumble.\\" It's wholly unexpected, approximating the sound of what Miles Davis' Sketches of Spain would have been like were it a collaboration with Charles Mingus. It's perfectly placed to knock out any last vestiges of resistance, leaving even the most hardened listener to break into a smile.<br />As the final track, \\"No Doze,\\" slowly recedes with a moaning cello and static, it becomes crystal clear that Burns and Covertino threw the maps out the window long ago and are blazing their own trail through the musical desert. How could you not want to follow along behind?<br />-- Barin McGrath
B00006F83Y|3.0|This CD is feels very dark to me and I like that.  I also really like the way this CD changes pace.  You can definately hear the Grohl effect.  If you like dark melodic hooks Songs for the deaf is full of them.  Doesn't hold up for very well to repeated listens - Three starts for Grohl!<br />Tim
B00005JLO2|2.0|Having seen both the TV version starring Beau Bridges and the 1939 version with Sir Ralph Richardson, I can categorically say that this current release is an insult to the previous films and certainly to the book.<br />First, this lacks any character development, and portrays Harry Faversham as a coward when, in fact, he was a conscientious objector (with the same fear anyone going to war would have).  Second (and as a consequence of the first), the moral messages of cowardice, valor, honor, and redemption are conspicuous by their absence.<br />There were some good scenes but I think this film is a tribute to missed opportunities.  Given the technology today, it could have been a magnificent film instead of a \\"rush to market\\" poorly told story.<br />I give this two stars because of the physical aspects of the film... beautiful scenery and I think the casting was good or, at least, had the potential had they been exposed to a decent script and direction with a sense of purpose.  This film is as much an epic drama as was the latest Pearl Harbor. Both are losers in my opinion.  Don't buy this and don't even bother renting it.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I rented this movie on dvd it was kind of scratched which kinda made me mad but that's not important right now what was interesting was how a girl got to be the double Hayley and never be seen that must of been fun to be a double of Hayley Mills I mean If I was a double of Hayley that would of been a blast I mean they were best friends on the set actually this whole dvd was intersting they had to use a split screen to do two Hayley's It's amazing now a days how they film movies with one actress playing two people like the 98' remake of Parent Trap. I loved this movie and I especially want you to see it
B000002V0Q|4.0|To tell you the truth, when I first thought about writing a review for this album I was tempted to give it 3 stars.  All I had heard prior to getting this was the 80s Megadeth, namely Peace Sells...But Whos Buying?  and the ULTIMATE thrash masterwork that is Rust In Peace.  <br />Upon first hearing this album, the song Skin O' My Teeth bursting into my speakers, I was INSTANTLY disappointed.  The song did nothing for me, sound too happy, was too slow, and I thought to myself that Megadeth had lost their touch.  I listened to the whole album and thought that it wasn't even near as good as it should have been.<br />However, this album is a GROWER.  I mean a real grower, as in you start off not liking it so much and after it sinks in, you find yourself bobbing your head up and down, singing along, and having a rollicking good time listening to the thing.  <br />I now think this album is simply, EXCEPTIONAL.  Comparisons to Metallica's Black Album  are inevitable, and I would also say necessary, as this was Mustaine's self-proclaimed 'Black Album killer'.  It not only kills the Black Album, it SLAYS it.  <br />Countdown to Extinction is one of the grooviest albums I've ever heard, the speed of Rust In Peace is sort of gone, but in it's place comes something that Rust lacked - sheer groove.  These songs are mid-paced, but man they make your head really bob up and down, the groove of this album is almost infectious.  In fact it's contagious.  I love it.<br />Also, Mustaine's lyrics are in fine fine form, only in a few moments (Psychotron being the prime example), does he come off as cheesy or lame.  The song Captive Honour (my favourite) has what I feel to be the best lyrics I've ever heard from him:<br />\\"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,<BR>Have you reached a verdict?\\"<BR>\\"We have your honour,<BR>We find the defendent guilty on all counts,<BR>For crimes against ALLL of humanity\\"<BR>\\"By the power vested in me by the state,<BR>I sentence you to be indisposed with NOOO chance of parole,<BR>For LIFE\\"<br />\\"LIFE!!???  WHADDA YA MEAN LIFE!!??  I AIN'T GOT A LIFE!!!!\\"<br />HAHHAH, I LOVE that bit, always makes me grin moronically, great stuff.  <br />Anyways...Marty Friedman is still is fine form, his solos still blister along, and are nicely melodic.  Menza's drumming is slightly disappointing though, rather subdued and boring after the FURY of his attack on Rust In Peace.<br />The reasons I gave this album 4 stars and not 5 are:<br />1.  Menza's drumming = boring<BR>2.  Psychotron, Skin O' My Teeth and High Speed Dirt are ALL boring and generic songs that offer nothing redeeming in terms of interesting riffs and melodies.  However, I find all the rest to be great tracks, particularly Captive Honour, which is BRILLIANT.  Hehe.<BR>3.  This was the start of what would lead to the ... album Cpytic Writings and the album that was ten times ... Risk.<BR>4.  I MISS the speed and the epicness, the grooviness is cool but sometimes I just want them to break out crazy Rust In Peace style.<BR>5.  It's not Rust In Peace.  Haha.<br />So overall, a fine fine fine entrance into the 90s for Megadeth.  Nothing could EVER top Rust In Peace, and so I'm not trying to judge it in comparison to that album...although its hard to avoid certainly...and all the guys saying that Countdown is better than Rust In Peace must be insane, NO WAY.  It's good but hells no, Rust In Peace is the best, Countdown don't come close sorry.<br />Conclusion - A groovy, great album with a few plunkers.
B000046PVN|5.0|The first totally complete version of the score for Superman: The Movie is one of the most spectacular soundtrack releases ever.  John Williams' entire score for the movie is here along with several alternate cues and other tracks that have never been released before.  The opening bars of the Superman fanfare are among the most recognizable of all super hero movies.  No music for a superhero even compares to the score for Superman, which is clearly superior to the music for the next 3 Superman movies, as well as to the scores for Batman, X-Men and Spiderman.  Along with the 2 cd's that contain the score, there is a booklet that contains pictures from the production, costumes and a breakdown of the tracks from the soundtrack.  It is a clearly superior soundtrack and a must for ay collector, soundtrack enthusiast or John Williams fan.

B000067CPX|5.0|For some of my favorite rock acts that date back to the 1980s, I am a bit hard on them when they become too mellow in the modern day compared to their hard rocking roots.  In some of those cases, it doesn't feel that they are being totally true to themselves musically.  However, I don't at all get that feeling when I listen to this album by the Red Hot Chili Pepers.  After all, they are not following any trend but simply putting out the music they want to.  Who else out there sounds similar to them?  No one that I can think of.<br />Like the amazing \\"Californication\\", the sound on this album is mellower and more melodic and the obscenities are minimal.  The vocals are better than ever, and the bass still cranks--even on the mellowest of the tracks.<br />The lead title track, also the first single released, is a great melodic catchy track with some \\"funk\\" still present in the song.  \\"Universally Speaking\\" is kind of a mid-temp track that is very melodic.  \\"This Is The Place\\" retains a little of the old funk element and has an exceptional bass line (even for these guys).  \\"The Zephyr Song\\" is a very pretty mid-tempo track with an unforgetable melodic chorus, while \\"Can't Stop\\" is very catchy and perhaps the funkiest song on the album.  \\"I Could Die For You\\" and \\"Midnight\\" are other melodic hightlights, \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" is another funky highlight, \\"Cabron\\" is very different with its Spanish sound and nice melodies, and \\"Tear\\" is an outstanding slow track.  The closing track \\"Venice Queen\\" is interesting and mellow overall as well.<br />I was also a fan of the Chili Pepers in the more hard core days of the legendary \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" album, but this current direction they have gone in is to me equally as good.  Don't think for a moment that these guys can't still rock.  They have simply added a diversity to their music and toned it down a bit over time.  The results are continued musical excellence.  I think that any RHCP fan should appreciate this album, but definitely buy if your favorite previous album by them is \\"Californication\\".
B000062TU1|5.0|I am sure many of you have heard the story line of \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" so I won't go into detail about the movie. I have seen some reviews to where I thought I was reading a Movie Critic column out of the New York Times. Don't over analyze this movie. It is a based on the Harry Potter book series that is intended for children, but has an appeasement for adults as well. The reason why I gave this five stars is simple: it is a family movie that has no profanity, sexual suggestions, or nuditiy. <br />The purpose of this review is to give an honest assessment of the DVD and if it is worth the money. In my opinion the answer is \\"Yes.\\" This movie is bound to be a classic in children's cinema and will have the same stature as \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"E.T.\\" <br />There are a lot of things we can spend $$$ on....why not invest it on a good family movie that you will have for years to come.
B000002L5I|5.0|This album was destined to become a modern day classic from the time it was released.  With the single \\"Blue On Black\\", blues rock had made it back onto rock radio in the late 1990s, which was very refreshing at the time.  For sure, tracks like \\"Slow Ride\\", \\"Everything Is Broken\\", and the other big rock radio track \\"Somehow, Somewhere, Someway\\" are all great jams.  \\"(Long) Gone\\" and \\"King's Highway\\" are among the other many highlights.  There are not really a lot of slow tracks on this (or any KWS) album, but for sure the track \\"I Found Love (When I Found You)\\" is a great slower song.<br />The reasons for comparing KWS to Stevie Ray Vaughan are obvious, and I wouldn't go as far as to say KWS is quite as good.  Nonetheless, he is right up there as a blues-rock artist.  If he continues to perform and put out new material (it has been awhile now), his status will someday be legendary.
B000002KXO|2.0|If not for Lindsey Buckingham this album would have been great.  He openly admits songwriting is not a strong point for him. He has had only one exelent song since Rumors and thats Big Love.  Stevie and Christens' songs were great especally Gypsy, Straight Back, and Thats Alright, Hold Me, and Love in Store.  I heard Stevie say that Gypsy was going to go on her Wild Heart album luckly for Fleetwood Mac, she gave it to them.  I think Lindsey Buckingham is unfortanately a has-been.  I hate to say that but it true.  Over all I would rank this a 2 star.
0671027573|5.0|This book was GREAT!  No other words can describe it.  Once I started I could not put it down.  I made a friend read it (doesn't read often) and she fell in love with it.  She now owns a copy of it as well.<br />Not only will you fall in love with the characters, you will cry with them too.  This book will keep you going until the bitter end!!!<br />I recommend this book to everyone!  It was just that good!!!  Have fun reading.
B00007E8V4|4.0|No, its not because Toxicity sold so many records and i automatically yell Sellout. I think it was radio that came to SOAD and not the other way around. I like this one better because they don't mesh songs that sound alike together. On Toxicity \\"Needles\\", \\"Deer Dance\\", and \\"Jet Pilot\\", sound like one song with just breaks in between. I also think their were some filler songs that could've been replaced by some of the songs on this one. For example \\"Shimmy\\" is not one of the most thought out songs they've ever recorded. I think they should've replaced it with \\"Mr. Jack\\" or \\"Boom\\". \\"Mr. Jack\\" is kind of the \\"Cop Killer\\" Body Count so long ago. It slams law enforcement for whatever reasons. \\"Boom\\" as you've probably seen on MTV2 is an anti-war song that ties in real well considering our country's present situation. Whether you agree or disagree, you gotta admit its a great song. \\"Highway Song\\" is probably my favorite track on drums as John slams with great intensity. \\"Roulette shows a melody with an acoustic song, and the band lyrically diversifies this song from others. It was written seven years ago and doesn't have a thing to do with politics or humor. I was dissappointed to see The Metro, Blue, Temper, Dam, Storaged, Marmalade, Snowblind, Virginity, or Outer Space make the album. But hey that makes room for another Steal This Album. I don't think either efforts upstage the self titled for its diversity and uniqueness.
B00005MP58|4.0|I just forced my husband to watch this over the weekend so I am somewhat P &amp; P obsessed right now. What can I say about this mini-series...if you love the book, this the mini-series for you. It remains faithful to the original work and the performences are excellent. I did feel they rushed the ending a bit-- showing the wedding instead of showing how they all ended up (like the novel). Also, there is some great dialogue between Darcy and Elizabeth in the novel in which Elizabeth asks Darcy when he loved her, etc. This was not put in the mini-series, so I think it was less romantic...the ending was so rushed, we didn't get to see them flirting and getting to know each other better. <BR>The reason I gave this DVD four stars instead of five is because of the DVD itself. This is a special edition DVD,but there is really nothing in it that makes it special...only a featurette. There is no commentary, no intereviews, no deleted scenes or anything. There aren't even subtitles...it's just a normal DVD- nothing special about it. The picture quality was quite good, however. All in all, I recommend it for all Austen (and especially P &amp; P) fans.
B0000028VT|4.0|This is most likely the most simple record Mariah has ever made.It consists of 99% ballads, which of course is not a problem, cause slower material has always been Mariah's strength.The ballads on here aren't as dramatic as on \\"Emotions\\", and not as complex and deep as on \\"Butterfly\\". Rather they are just meat and potatoes.Really sweet, with light melodies that flow together perefctly, creating for easy, enjoyable listening.<br />1.Dreamlover-Mariah flirts with modern r n'b on this up-tempo.A cute little song,light-hearted, and summery, but nothing that makes it's mark.<br />2.Hero-\\"Vintage Mariah\\".lol.Yeah, I just think it's a very inspirational, up-lifting song.It's one of Mariah's simplest songs in terms of vocals and arangements, but I mean, that's what suits this song best.<br />3.Anytime You Need a Friend-A gospel ballad.Not one of my favorites.<br />4.Musicbox-My fave song here.This ballad is just gorgeous.The melody is beautiful, and she sings it with so much emotion.<br />5.Now That I know-Forgettable up-tempo.<br />6.Never Forget You-A really sunny ballad written by Babyface.One of my favorites here.<br />7.Without You-Possibly Mariah's best cover.She turns in a performance of so much depth,and soul that I dare the original performers to rival this.<br />8.Just To Hold You Once Again-A haunting ballad.Love it.<br />9.I've Been Thinking About You-Another lifeless pop song.There was no need for the up-tempos on this album.I think they were just here for the sake of just being here.They add nothing to the record whatsoever, and just take up space.<br />10.All I've Ever Wanted-A dreamy,beautiful ballad, and the perfect one to end the album with.<br />Again, even though there were only 10 tracks, it didn't seem like anything was missing.Anyone who has a spot in their heart for ballads(like me!)will love this, as it is coming from one of the best voices-ever.And all the ballads on here are top-notch.
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing only the song &quot;Yellow&quot;. That is a great song, but so are &quot;Spies&quot;, &quot;Shiver&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;... Basically, there is not a song on this CD I do not like. That doesn't happen often, when you buy a disc for one song and end up liking every song on it, which only makes me appreciate this one all the more. They have a fresh, distinct sound, which seems to be carried forward into their new CD &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. I have only heard &quot;Clocks&quot; from that one, but I have it on order and can't wait for it to arrive!<br />I also like Sarah MacLachlan, Sheryl Crow, Peter Gabriel, Morcheeba, Train, Creed, MatchBox 20, Natalie Merchant, REM, Enya, and Dido. If you have these tastes in common with me, then ColdPlay is a MUST!
B000002BQK|5.0|Words do not begin to describe how beautiful this record is I honestly do not understand how ANYONE can have any complaints about this record whatsoever, it is absolutely flawless. More than that, it's completely honest,and deep. I like her previous albums, but none of them sounded inspired.You could take each ballad and substituite it for the next one, and you wouldn't notice.You could do the same with the uptempos, and so on. Practically everything she sang up until this point was uninspired, and you could tell it wasn't really the music Mariah had her heart in. Then came Mariah's divorce, and Mariah decided to show the world that there was a true artist underneath all the hype, that Mariah was more than just the all-american sweetheart with the golden voice. And boy, did she succeed. Butterfly is up there with my favorite albums of all time, and is with no doubt one of the best albums of the 90's.It is so honest, and heartfelt, each and every single song is brimming with emotion. And ANYONE who has ever had any doubt about Mariah's lyrical abilities can roll over.Mariah presents some of the best lyrics ever written by a female artist. Lyrics which are personal,meaningful, and quietly empowering.When she sings of love, she sounds sensual,and longing, not as though she were told to write some gushy fluff. Whatever she is saying on this album, you know it is comming from the heart. The music on this album is incredible.It is so well produced, that every vocal,every beat,everysound just glides together to create a smooth plethora of beauty.The music on this album is kind of like really,really smooth r n'b mixed with some hip hop,and soul.While her voice has clearly lost a lot of it's prowess, it nevertheless is incredible, and is demonstrated to it's most effective extent. Never has she sounded as though she were enjoying herself so much.This album is the definition of music.This is what all music should be like-creative,different,honest, and the results are of course beautiful. The first track is \\"Honey\\"-This track has awesome beats, and makes you wanna dance like crazy.It's hip,saucy,and classy.Track two is \\"Butterfly\\"-The title track is a full-bodied, original ballad with great lyrics.Track three is \\"My All\\"-What a timeless and beautiful song this is.I'll never get tired of it.There is so much emotion in her voice on this one.<BR>Track four is \\"The Roof\\"-An upbeat track, not as fast as Honey though.Dark,pulsating beats, paired with seductive lyrics and breathy vocals create one heck of a song.Track five is \\"Fourth of July\\"-I love this song so much.Beautiful lyrics, and some of the sweetest emotions I've ever heard.Just a wonderful relaxing song. \\"Breakdown\\" is track six, and is a lite mid-tempo hip hop track.Very original,and sweet.Don't be fooled by the title.This song is quite light-hearted. Track seven is \\"Babydoll\\"-one of my favorites on here.The verses start out dry, and then the song breaks out into a passioante concoction of hip-hop soul.This song is totally unique, and despite the title, is very sexy(I wana be your babydoll.wrap me up nice and tight,love me all through the night.Cover me with velvet kisses wrap me up and hold me close,and softly whisper to me,you wanna be my babydoll).Things cool down with track eight,\\"Close My Eyes\\"-a soft midtempo ballad, with very gentle vocals.The lyrics are about how throughout the difficult times in her life, sometimes it's just helped to calm herself down, and look at things through a clearer,more peacful perspective.A lovely song.Track nine is \\"Whenever You Call\\"-There's a duet with Brian Mcnight which can be found on her #1's collection.I prefer this version better though.It's a really beautiful ballad, and her voice is just amazing.Track ten is\\"Fly Away,Butterfly Reprise\\"-Although well done, I don't enjoy this song and never listen to it.It's kind of like a dance version of \\"Butterfly\\".I don't really see the point to it.Track eleven is a cover of the obscure Prince song \\"The Beautiful Ones\\".The cover is amazing, and although it takes patience (it clocks in around 7 min!!) the wait is well worth it.At the end things just explode.It features Sisquo of the band \\"Dru Hill\\".While Sisquo is good, he cannot keep up with Mariah on the song, and would've been best left off.The closing track is\\"Outside\\"-This is the best ballad I've ever heard in my life.THE BEST SONG ON THE CD,and my favorite Mariah song in general.It has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard, and she just completely belts it out at the end. This song shows the best of Mariah Carey, and it really IS NOT your everyday ballad. There you have it.That's \\"Butterfly\\" for you folks.Butterfly is so much more deep and intricate than you would ever imagine.If you don't love every single song the first time you hear it, that's ok, because, with each listen things get better and better.Trust me,eventually you WILL love every song on here.This is the album that made me love Mariah oh-so much.This was the last I ever saw of Mariah, but I'm glad that before she went, she was able to make something so beautiful.
B000009EAD|5.0|This is, without a doubt, THE definitive Iced Earth album. Heavy, fast, intense at times; light, slow, quiet at others. This is the album to buy if you're first getting into Iced Earth. It shows the best of everyone's abilities; band leader/rhythm guitarist/songwriter John Schaffer's heavy riffs and melodies, not to mention his superb songwriting skills, are among their best here. Matthew Barlow shows off the best of his vocal ranges on this album, hitting such high screeches and deep growls...one of the best vocalists alive, that's for sure. And Larry Tarnowski's lead guitar riffs are superb, as always. This album is full of unpredictable moments of heaviness and melody, except in the way the songs were arranged: heavy-soft-heavy-soft-heavy-soft-heavy-swaggering-heavy...and then there's the \\"Something Wicked\\" trilogy at the end. I'll get to that later. Meanwhile, a song-by-song review:<br />BURNING TIMES--\\"It doesn't matter what you've done, in my words you are a sinner...\\" I get chills every time at Matthew Barlow's growls in the chorus. A fairly fast-paced riff masterpiece, (with bells chiming at the beginning and end, similar to NIGHT OF THE STORMRIDER's \\"Angel's Holocaust\\", this is a great album-starter.<br />MELANCHOLY (HOLY MARTYR)--At first I was somewhat unimpressed by this song, mostly for the gentle, quivering, almost weak vocals at the beginning, but since then I've learned that this is a song about Christ on the cross, and his resulting sorrow--and I realized the vocals couldn't have been better. Soft acoustic passages in the intro and verses are nice breathers before heavier, lingering riffs and a beautiful solo.<br />DISCIPLES OF THE LIE--WOW! Probably one of the heaviest songs on the album, not to mention most intense. Starts off fast, ends fast. Matthew's howls of fury in the chorus...mindblowing. Drums really stand out in this song, too. Instead of a guitar solo, there is a haunting keyboard solo over the rhythm section, and then the vocals and guitars kick back in behind it...ooooh, good stuff.<br />WATCHING OVER ME--A good breather after \\"Disciples\\", this is a wonderful tribute to a late friend of John Schaffer's, who died in a motorcycle accident shortly before Iced Earth's first album came out. Quiet acoustic passages and a wonderful solo (performed by producer Jim Morris). Excellent stuff.<br />STAND ALONE--Far better than Godsmack's recent song of the same name (no relation otherwise), and with a better message: \\"Listen not to ones who preach/ Those who feel you're a freak...\\". This is a good song to listen to when depressed from peer torment. Excellent, heavy, angry, but soothing. Gotta love the little post-chorus solos! And whoever said this ... Metallica's \\"Blackened\\" should see a psychiatrist.<br />CONSEQUENCES--And back to the mellow...wow...this is a song that deserves lighters held high. Sad, quiet choruses, acoustic/clean electric guitars...the whole song is quiet for the most part, until the bridge, where heavier riffs come in to back a powerful and climatic solo. Matthew Barlow's screeches at the end of the bridge are perfect. My favorite slow song on here.<br />MY OWN SAVIOR--Great headbanging song. Fast, intense, and a good \\"... off\\" chorus to shout at while blaring this from your stereo. I love the quieter pre-chorus parts; sort of a place to take a breather before screaming your head off. Yeah, DEFINATELY a good headbanging song.<br />REAPING STONE--This is the only song on the album that I'd give less than 5 stars to. It's Iced Earth, don't get me wrong, but...it seems to \\"swagger\\" too much. The lyrics start off interesting, with a woman lost in the woods who runs accross some cursed \\"reaping stone\\", but then the rest of the song seems too focused on the seductive words of the reaping stone, as sung to her. It might have been better if the song described just what was happening to her. Good music though; the bridge is reminiscent of Metallica's \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\"--NOT a ..., but SIMILAR. I like it like that. Okay song, but my least favorite on the album, possibly out of all Iced Earth's stuff.<br />1776--INSTRUMENTAL TIME! This song is fast, intense, amazing! Furiously lightning-paced, and a beautiful flute solo over a good drumroll in the bridge. Excellent instrumental, one of my all-time favorites from Iced Earth!<br />BLESSED ARE YOU--This is a song dedicated to all the millions of fans of Iced Earth out there; heavy yet melodic, with a great opening of clean guitars and singing. A great way of saying thanks--YOU ARE VERY WELCOME!<br />------SOMETHING WICKED (trilogy)-------<br />PROPHECY--My favorite song out of the trilogy, quite possibly on the whole album. Good 'n' heavy, nice guitar solo, and a couple sweet bass solos!  Best part of the song would have to be just before the bridge, where the tempo rears up like some gigantic beast, then launches into this ultra-heavy and fast thrash monster.  While the song is generally heavy throughout, the chorus riffs are so heavy and perfect...OOH! ...and then there's the plot. Ages ago, a race of beings foresaw the coming of the human race, which would threaten to wipe them extinct. They seek to create a savior for their kind, who will be born aeons later to wreak havoc on mankind. A chilling, Lovecraftian plot, this song ends with an honestly frightening (to me, anyway) sound: the tick-tock of a clock, signifying the passing of time as they prepare to bring about our doom.<br />BIRTH OF THE WICKED--The Watcher has been born! The story continues through this fast thrash piece, but not as chilling (to me) as \\"Prophecy\\".<br />THE COMING CURSE--The Watcher has begun his wreaking of havoc upon all! Here we find that he has begun the absolute apocalypse. John Schaffer stated that this trilogy of songs is sort of a precursor to a whole other story, one which we can assume will be a future concept album as the Watcher brings about the end of mankind and the return of his own kind. Can't wait!
B000002AVF|4.0|This is a very good album, and one that certaintly did not dissapoint.I don't think that it ranks among her best recordings, but it's a very consistent,satisfying record.This album was the perfect mix of pop/r n'b, and one that you couldn't really categorize.On this album, you can hear Mariah breaking out,from her all-american,diva style, and into something of her own.<br />1-Fantasy-This song is fun, and perfectly sung.But the remix is way better.It gives the song more edge, and makes it more distinctive.<br />2.Underneath The Stars-A more personal song, telling a simple story about a romance Mariah once had.The lyrics paint a picture in your head and the whole song is just very sweet and relaxing.It's a song about love, but one that doesn't fall under the adult contemporary genre.<br />3. One Sweet Day, feat Boyz II Men-Can you say BIG HIT?All the hype aside, I think it's just a lovely song, with a great chorus, and a nice blend of vocals.<br />4.Open Arms-Originally, this song was done by Journey.But, I don't know how anyone can top this.Her voice completely soars in the chorus.Beautiful.<br />5.Always Be My Baby-A really fun up-beat song that always puts me in a good mood.It's definately one of Mariah's more memorable up-tempos.<br />6.I Am Free-A gospel-ly tune which sounds like something from emotions.It's a really nice song, but her voice isn't in it's best form here.<br />7.When I Saw You-One of those hoplessely romantic songs that sounds like it could belong in a movie.It's really pretty.<br />8.Long Ago-A faster song, which up to that point was the most r n'b Mariah had gone.It's ok,but it doesn't add anything to the record, and could've easily been left off.<br />9.Melt Away-A really sweet song with Babyface written all over it(he did collaborate on the song, so that explains it).Even though there have been a million songs like this done before(especially the chorus)I do enjoy listening to it, especially when I want to chill.<br />10.Forever-This song isbeautiful.There's a bit of a 50's edge to it, and I love the backup singers on the bridge of the song.Everything about this song works.<br />11.Daydream Interlude(Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix)-There's really no point to it.It's like a club/dance version of \\"Fantasy\\", except, it's the length of an interlude.<br />12.Looking In-This song alone is worth the entire cd.It has one of the saddest, most beautiful tunes I've ever heard, and some of the best, most deepest lyrics Mariah has written.<br /> This album isn't anything groundbreaking, but it certaintly is a really well put-together recording, and one of the best additions to both pop and r n'b throughout the 90's.
B00006BTCA|1.0|yeah, you heard me, ONE STAR.<br />ok, so this band was SO hyped up, as some sort of rebirth of NYC post punk. yeah, was i excited? you bet.<br />what did i get? a bunch of socially (and fashionably) inept hipsters ripping off everyone from the smiths (say hello to the angels) to joy division (....every single track).<br />i hear all this business about complex song structures and melodies, ARE WE LISTENING TO THE SAME ALBUM?? i mean i guess on paper saying &quot;HEY WE'RE TOO COOL FOR A CHORUS IN THIS SONG, LETS JUST GO ON A BORING TANGENT AND SING LIKE THAT GUY FROM THAT BAND WHO KILLED HIMSELF&quot; might seem like a good idea to a bunch of people without ears or taste, but to the rest of us? come ON!<br />i really really hate this band, and i dont understand how they get away with being a total cover band.
B0000028P8|4.0|Her live mtv concert in 1992(I think), was what shut up all the critics, and naysayers who didn't believe Mariah could deliver.She sure can, and not only did she prove them wrong, she made them roll over!The live arrangements were soulful,and kicked a*&amp;.And the back-up singers and band were just incredible, and they added so much sass and sauce to the whole performance.I wish that there were more songs, though. But, that is really my only complaint.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|A tradition has been built on this movie. Both of my sons run cross-country for their high school and before the big championship meet at the end of the season, the team watches the opening scene with George C. Scott giving his classic speech to the troops with the background of that huge flag behind him. And the movie just gets better from there. Near-perfect performances from Scott and Karl Malden with an equally strong supporting cast. Some of the historical details have been glossed over, but that's ok; it actually strengths the film overall. And who can forget the wonderful theme music?! <br />My grandfather served under Patton in Germany, and he brought home an intense admiration of his commanding general, which seems to be the tomes of this movie. Even while presenting some of Patton's faults, the viewer is left with an image of a larger-than-life American hero.
0792844882|4.0|Hokey story of bimbo with a past who blows into Las Vegas and finds herself the highlight of show.  Some interesting moments, though acting is mediocre.  For some reason, though, it holds your interest throughout and I've acquired it as part of my DVD library.  Don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This album is the reason I fell for Nickelback.  And no, it wasn't just because of the big hits.  They're great, but the rest of the album is just awesome.  It really never quits.  The guitar work sucks you in and won't let go.  Definitely ad this album to your collection.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine were by no means the first to mix rap and rock (that was Aerosmith and Run DMC with their collaboration on a remake of \\"Walk This Way\\"), but they were the first rock band fronted by a rapper.  And this is their best album.  The politically charged lyrics of Zack de la Rocha and the riffs of Tom Morello make this the best rock/rap recording in the history of the rock/rap genre.<br />As far as playing technique, Tom Morello couldn't hold a candle to people like Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eddie Van Halen.  But as a riffmeister, Morello is the best in the business.  His riffs are simple and easy to learn, but at the same time are mind-blowing.  I guarantee that if you were to look at a \\"Best Guitar Riffs of All Time\\" list, you would definitely find something by RATM there.  Though RATM were fronted by a rapper, you will find none of the \\"yo yo Rage in the house\\" B.S. here.  Zack de la Rocha actually has a message, preaching his political views over some of the best riffs in rock & roll history.  Every song has a message of some sort.  Despite being as popular as they were, they never let that get to their heads, and they always stuck to their guns until the day de la Rocha parted ways with RATM.<br />Every song on the album is a gem.  The album's opener, \\"Bombtrack,\\" starts off softly then kicks into high gear, setting the standard for this great album of rapped politics and excellent riff 'n' roll.  \\"Killing In the Name\\" is arguably the best song in the RATM catalogue.  The riffs are among Morello's best ever.  The bass driven \\"Bullet In The Head\\" showcases the bass talents of Tim Commerford (here known as Timmy C., he changes his name for every RATM album), along with great riffing.  \\"Wake Up\\" recalls Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\" in one section, and again features excellent riffing.  The album's closer, \\"Freedom,\\" is an amazing track that clocks in at 6 minutes, the closest thing RATM has ever done to an epic.  There are many different sectionswith great riffs galore and awesome lyrics to boot.<br />This album is definitely recommended to any rock fan.  Unlike Limp Bizkit and Crazy Town, RATM is a rap/rock band that it is OK for fans of real good music to like, as it is OK for those of us to enjoy System of a Down, while the ignorant nu-metal fans can enjoy them as well.  This is a raw, rocking, B.S. free album that is highly recommended.<br />5/5
B00000J2PH|5.0|A treasure!  Incredibly beautiful acoustic piano lines, vocals, with layer upon layer.  After you hear Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow you'll never be able to listen to the Shirelles' version again without grimacing.  And her version of Natural Woman is up there with Aretha's!  Subsequent albums have never matched the experience.  Still fresh after all these years.
0385335482|4.0|I loved this book. I found it a little slow at first. I kept wondering if the whole book would be following the main character around on her shopping sprees. A little tedious at first. But when the plot got going, I couldn't put it down. I would cringe at the messes she got herself in and found myself mentally screaming \\"no, don't do it\\". I bought this book and the sequel \\"Shopaholic takes Manhatten\\" at the same time. I'm so glad I did. Therefore, I was fortunate to have the second installment at my fingertips as I couldn't wait to see what trouble she would get herself into in NYC. Easy read. Great beach, bathtub, airplane, lazy day, etc. book to read.
B000088E6M|4.0|50 CENT ALBUM IS THE BEST ALBUM OUT RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE HE SET A NEW TREND OUT ON THE STREETS 4 US WITH THE WANKSTAS 2 ALL JOKES ON JA RULE. HE IS OFF THE CHAINZ, ALL THE SONGS IN THE ALBUM HAS A DIFFERENT VIBE, ITS DEFINETLY DIFFERENT MATERIAL COMPARED TO ALL THESE COMMERCIAL RAPPERS THATS OUT RIGHT NOW. HE IS NOT NEW TO THE GAME BUT WITH WANKSTA AND WITH IN THE CLUB HE DEFINETLY MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF IN THE RAP GAME. I GIVE HIS ALBUM A 4 BECAUSE SOME OF THE SONGS WERE MAKING ME A LIL DEPRESS BECAUSE HE KEPT PUTTING OUT THE MESSAGE ABOUT GUNS, VIOLANCE AND HIS CLICK CALLED G UNIT , BUT OVERALL THE ALBUM IS REAL GANGSTA SO I SUGGEST U KNOW A LIL ABOUT THE STREETS BEFORE U PURCHASE THIS ALBUM BECUASE YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND IT. HE IS DEFINETLY NOT LIKE EMINEM AND DRE I FEEL HE IS LYRICALLY BETTER THAT IS MY OWN OPINION. MY FAVORITE SONGS IN THIS ALBUM ARE MANY MEN,PATIENLY WAITING, WHAT UP GANGSTA, BACK DOWN,P.I.M.P, AND DONT PUSH ME. THE REST OF THE SONGS ARE ALRIGHT BUT I DONT REALLY CARE TO MUCH FOR IT. OVERALL IT GETS A 4 CUZ ITS REAL GOOD AND ITS REAL. <br />IF U LIKE MY REVIEW GO BUY IT THEN!!!! G UNIT...
B00004ZAV3|5.0|That the Beatles 1, released in 2000, would see the once-Fabs again top the charts, is a testament to the strength of their songs. There's nothing here not already available on other disks, but if you were a fledgling Beatles fan (are there any?) then this would be a good place to start for a taste.<br />This is a concise piece of history, from 1963-1970, and one can listen to the growth and evolution of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in a single sitting. Not only did they grow as musicians and songwriters, but the technology grew with them, or they forced it to grow.<br />&quot;Love Me Do&quot; kicks things off with primitive harmonica and rhythms, then there's smash after smash with &quot;She Loves You,&quot; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&quot; &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; and Beatlemania in full bloom. This disk just doesn't let up. It keeps right on going with &quot;Help!&quot; &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; &quot;Come Together,&quot; and &quot;Let it Be.&quot; What other artist can boast a hits package of 27 cuts with no filler? My criticism would be that this isn't even a definitive set, and I agree with what seem to be obvious omissions. But heck, why stop here. Get The Beatles 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 (The Red and Blue Albums) for more great music, more depth and song lyrics included. Again, this is just a starter set to whet your appetite.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I am in my late twenties and I loved this movie!  I had stopped watching \\"cartoons\\" but my friend who is 31 got this movie for Christmas, and I watched it twice at her house.  Now I have to get my own copy.  I'm just trying to find the best deal.  This movie has a great story and is very funny.  I love to laugh.  I'm going to check out the other \\"kiddie\\" movies that I passed over because I thought I was too old
B00000J2L8|5.0|This is certainly a cynical view of the military-industrial machinations of the Cold War combatants, but it's all kinds of funny.<br />From &quot;Peace is Our Profession&quot; to &quot;You can't fight in here, this is the war room!&quot;, this movie hits on every joke.  Peter Sellers is great in three roles, and George C. Scott (as General Turgidson) is one of the funniest characters in movie history.<br />They say that the best satire contains an element of truth, and this axiom certainly holds for this movie.  The funniest (or most disturbing, perhaps) thing about this movie is that it really doesn't seem that far out of the realm of possibility of things that could've happened in the early sixties, in the era of McCarthyism and the Red Menace.  I think Kubrick hit the nail squarely on the head here, and created a classic.
B00005JLXC|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this movie. It is about a guy named Matt Murdock, and he is a laywer. By day, of course. He is the super hero Dardevil, and he is played by Ben Affleck. I saw this movie for my birthday party, and I just loved it. My favorite character was Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner), because she was so cool! Her cool Sais did the trick, probably. This movie definitely deserves a sequel, because of the cool ending. I'm not going to spoil it though! Also, when I saw it, I just thought Bullseye was so cool, and so mean! Dardevil's costume wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worst either. Elektra had an awesome costume. I liked the action and the comedy!

0375707972|3.0|Once again, I read an \\"Oprah Pick\\" without realizing it until afterword. Anyway... this is a superficially simple novel that, for all its flaws, is worth spending a little time thinking about. The foremost thing to realize about it, is that it's main theme concerns postwar Germany's grappling with the legacy of the Holocaust. It's about those who were adults during the war, and the next generation. It's about how that younger generation (of which Schlink is certainly a member) reacted to the generation and individuals who participated in the Holocaust.<br />Recounted in memoir form, the story begins with the tale of a 15-year-old boy and his sexual affair with a 36-year-old tram female tram conductor. The man tells of this time with a certain air of nostalgia that is somewhat understandable. And yet, if one thinks about the ages of the two people, it's also horrific. Make the boy a girl, and make the conductor a man, the psychological dynamic becomes rather clear. This is a problematic element in the novel, and one that is never dealt with in any way.<br />Years after their affair had ended, the now young man discovers that his older lover was a concentration camp guard and was involved in an incident in which a number of prisoners were locked inside a burning church. The twist in the matter is that she fails to properly defend herself of the charges of being the ringleader in the incident because she is secretly illiterate. Clearly the author isn't trying to excuse her war crimes in any way, or imply that she's somehow not really at fault. In prison she learns to read and studies the Holocaust in great deal, and importantly, decides that there is no redemption or atonement available for what she did.<br />But does the author mean this to apply to all Nazis? Or just those who fell into it? And what precisely does that mean? And, and important, but unexplored point, why does he chose to mention at the very beginning that she is Romanian, and never again? So, plenty to think about and discuss. I found the writing to be very precise and clean, an apparently excellent translation, although others' tastes may vary. Someone should translate and publish his crime novels.o think about and discuss.

B00005OAIE|3.0|From the moment I heard of the name John Mayer, I was expected by one of my closest friends to cherish his music and hold his name in equation with great music. I used a free coupon I had for my BMG music membership to order the album \\"Room for Squares\\". I received it a week or so later and proceeded to sit in my room, uninterrupted, listening to his music. The first song gripped me right off the bat. It felt true. The lyrics were, in a word, perfect. They agreed with my perceptions of the high school I had graduated just a year previous. I fricking hated that place and everything it represented. I wasn't part of the prom king community nor did I take kindly to being spoken to in a condescending way. I identified with the song and hold it in high regard to this day. That song is \\"No Such Thing.\\"<br />The second song on the album made my heart sink. It demonstrated a lack of true musical talent. The music for that song, \\"Georgia\\", wasn't nearly as intricate or involving as that for \\"No Such Thing.\\" Also, I picked up on a certain urgency on John Mayer's part to cram too many words into the melody. The words, how they were sang, and how they flowed, didn't mesh with the music.<br />This was only the beginning of my disappointment. My faith was temporarily renewed when I listened to \\"Neon,\\" which seemed to demonstrate the same kind of mastery over melody and lyric that \\"No Such Thing\\" had. The rest of the album shared the same downward spiral pattern of \\"Georgia.\\" And \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" made me smack my head. This was a deliberate attempt to get on the good side of easily manipulated teenage girls who were just growing out of the Spears-Aguilera phase, and with boy bands like Backstreet Boys and N'Sync pretty much out of the picture, Mayer is the perfect transference device for that baseless adoration.<br />I began to wonder as I looked through the liner notes for the CD exactly what it was I was picking up on. Such wonderful songs were \\"No Such Thing,\\" \\"Neon,\\" and even \\"Love Song for No One\\", and such great poetry was the album as a whole, but why were the remaining songs on the disc so devoid of true musical feeling? Then I saw it: the lyrics of \\"No Such Thing,\\" \\"Neon,\\" and \\"Love Song for No One\\" were set to the music John Mayer had written with a partner (Clay Cook). This was my answer. Mayer pretty much fails as a composer. The music he writes himself is too simple to be combined with such poetic, complicated lyrics. On the whole, I respect John Mayer's ability as a lyricist. But I think he would've been better off as the coffee house poet who occasionally strums his guitar to accent certain stanzas. His talent on this album is evident, but it is not nearly that which merits a Best New Artist Grammy, or any Grammy whatsoever. This is a musician who has a lot to work on before he can achieve the true greatness many young people feel he has already achieved.<br />I give this album an overall positive rating because of Mayer's lyrical talents and for the feat of getting two great songs on one album (something not easily done), but make no mistake: \\"Room for Squares\\" definitely has room for improvement.and even \\"Love Song for No One\\", and such great poetry was the album as a whole, but why were the remaining songs on the disc so devoid of true musical feeling?

B00006FDCD|5.0|A TV movie which receives a 5 star rating?  I know, I can't believe I'm giving the movie this much stars.  In fact, I can.<br />IT proves to be one of King's top notch bestsellers and certainly one of his most chilling works.<BR>'It' is a personification of all the evil that lurks beneath Maine, an evil that only children can see.<br />The film focuses on a particular group of youngsters of whom 'It' preys on the most.  It tells each child's own experience with 'It' and also focuses on their horrific experiences with 'It'.  Tim Curry plays the murderous clown with unholy relish.  As well as this, the musical score within the movie is enough to scare anyone for months.<BR>I'll say no more; watch the movie...if you dare
0060537639|5.0|This part of history has been neglected, and it is about time It is about time for this for it to be set straight. As explained in the book, The records were mostly destroyed when China turned inward. The Chinese themselves have not claimed credit for the voyages of Zheng He. Further research could no doubt be done, especially in finding evidence of Chinese landings at a variety of places. Nevertheless, this is an important book and well written. A minor defect is the confusion resulting from the recording of Chinese names sometimes in official pinyin and sometimes in Wade-Giles romanization.
B00006690G|5.0|Ok, this a quality CD let me start off with that.  No... actually I changed my mind, let me start over.  This is a quality CD for people over the age of 18 haha.  Okay.  This CD has a lot of Eminem and his aggressive sounds that make him sound amazingly good with his sick beats and styles, but my point i'm trying to make is (mom & dad...)  definately don't let your child buy it.  ...   I hope you make the right choice!  (RIP SAndra)
B00006AW2M|4.0|This album does have some great moments on it, although it's not too many people's favourite Stones' albums.  It was recorded in the midst of Mick, Keith and Brian's infamous drug busts.  This album features one of their sweetest ballads \\"She's a Rainbow\\" (at least until the violins screech a rather eerie coda with an abrasive guitar riff to follow), which helped sell a few gaudy looking computers in the 1990's.  \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" was supposedly contrived from the alienation Mick felt during the infamous drug busts and there's a cool sounding mellotron provided by Brian and some eerie piano work from Nicky Hopkins (I think this was his debut with the Stones).  \\"Citadel\\" could fit in as part of any 1960's sci-fi soundtrack (Brian provides saxophone and probably a glockenspiel, whatever that clinking sound is at the chorus and Keith's guitar riff is a nice touch).  Bill Wyman contributes his 1st song as he sings \\"In Another Land\\" (although Bill isn't much of a singer, this song features a cool harpsicord by Nicky).  \\"2000 Man\\" is sort of a country rock meets Motown song (that's Bill snoring at the beginning).  \\"The Lantern\\" has some eerie lyrics set to a gospel-flavoured piano and some funky guitar licks.  \\"Sing This All Together\\" is a singalong which supposedly features John and Paul in the chorus.  Not as clever is \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" as Mick moans and screams in the microphone for 5 minutes, not unlike \\"Goin' Home.\\"  Keith sounds bored playing the same chords for 5 minutes.  You can hear Mick audibly asking at the beginning \\"Where's that joint?\\"  \\"On With the Show\\" is about a sleazy pub- \\"Your wife will never know that you're not really working late!\\"  The worst song is \\"Gomper\\" with a sloppy repetitive jam ( a sitar, a Hammond organ and some self-conscious Eastern philosophy).  All in all, not a bad album but the Stones would prove on the next album Beggars Banquet that they were the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, not the World's Greatest Psychedellic Band.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Loosely based on the 1954 murder case of Sam Sheppard - whose son fights to clear his father's name to this day - 1960s television created an added dose of drama by allowing The Fugitive (the late David Janssen) to escape from prison, and hunt down the man who murdered his wife in cold blood.<br />Perhaps never in the history of TV was a plotline so ripe for the treatment (and budget) afforded by the big screen - and, perhaps, never has it been done so well.<br />Harrison Ford plays Doctor Richard Kimble, a Chicago-area vascular surgeon (\\"What the hell is that?\\" asks one of his pursuers. \\"Someone who makes a lot more money than you,\\" answers another in the easy, natural humor of two people who've worked together for years) who seems, at first, too good to be true. A philanthropist respected by the community, loved by his colleagues and adored by his wife, you can't help but wonder if there's trouble in paradise, despite the shadowy presence of Helen Kimble's (Sela Ward, bringing remarkable life to a dead woman, thanks to flashbacks) killer.<br />Chicago's finest quickly come to the same conclusion, and a damning 911 phone call by the dying victim seals Kimble's fate - a death sentence!<br />Fate, however, has other ideas. One of four survivors of the most spectacular - and controversial - train wreck ever captured on film, Kimble sets off to blend in to the Windy City's skyline long enough to find the man who took Helen from him. He has plenty of clues to start him on the trail; his biggest enemy not so much his pursuers as time itself.<br />Deputy United States Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), meantime, is as dogged as his prey; so determined to capture \\"my man\\" that, when confronted by the fugitive Kimble and his professed innocence, snaps back, \\"I don't care!\\"<br />Though Gerard isn't \\"out to solve a puzzle here,\\" Kimble is, and with equal persistence. The plot that led to the death of his wife is revealed in tense, dramatic fashion to the audience as Kimble himself learns it - and learns who has betrayed him.<br />What remains, of course, is whether his time has run out.<br />Ford's Kimble is what many people would consider an oxymoron: A truly benevolent, honest doctor. Best known as the almost-reckless Indiana Jones, Ford plays Kimble as a highly intelligent man who uses his wits and a level head to keep one step in front of not one, but two groups of adversaries.<br />Hot on Kimble's heels, Jones' Gerard does Ford one better by creating a lawman walking the thin line between pursuit and obsession. \\"Never argue with the big dog,\\" Gerard admonishes his team, when Kimble shows up \\"not dead yet\\" - proof, yet again, that \\"the big dog is always right.\\"<br />Hunter and prey, cat and mouse, Jones and Ford present real people trapped in a deadly game. The viewer quickly bonds with Kimble and roots for his success, while not quite able to root against Gerard. \\"It's alright if you catch him,\\" we seem to be saying, \\"just, not yet!\\"<br />A supporting cast including Joe Pantoliano, Jeroen Krabbe and Julianne Moore (in a small, but pivotal role) is equally up to the task; never did anyone's performance feel like they were acting, and the rich range of emotions coupled with crisp pacing, a riveting storyline and a properly brassy soundtrack adds up to one of the finest films ever made.<br />Virtually every person on Earth has seen The Fugitive; buy the DVD, and you'll never forget why.
