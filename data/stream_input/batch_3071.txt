B0027Z5DM6|4.0|Good movie, but some scenes were too sexual.Good message,good effects, not a good lenguage.in general it is okay Thanks you.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|I read the book and love the movie just as much. I have watched so many times. I would recommend it.
B00EU98VVC|5.0|If you are new to Tyr this is the album to start with! Then you will get every thing they have ever made!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Really liked it!! Complicated and simple, clean finish. If you're not into fantasy, don't let that part get you bogged down, definitely worth finishing!
B002DJSBMA|5.0|Very good movie. Brad Pitt is awesome and Anthony Hopkins is as great as usual in this very funny movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well developed and compelling characters.  A glimpse into Afghanistan's tragic history from the perspective of it's people.  Hard to put down.
B000I9X7M6|4.0|I like it. I think Romeo and Juliet have great chemistry. it's definitely not your traditional Romeo and Juliet but still entertaining
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy crush can be addicting and a lot of fun, but it basically comes down to luck and some of the levels take a long time to get through.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Like other 1 star reviewer said It is soooooo BORING!!! I would give it 0 star if I could. DO NOT BUY this book!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy hookup to wireless network.  Can stream anything on your computer as long as computer is on the same wireless network.  Have to install the google cast add on to chrome browser.  However, if desktop is wired V. wireless, then streaming from the desktop might not work.  But who uses their desktop anyway, lol!  This device shines using your smartphone to control all aspects of viewing.  Cast youtube and netflix right from any smartphone.  The smartphone is your new remote control.  Doesn't run down the phone battery at all.  Once the video is cast, Google Chromecast player takes over and phone hibernates.  On old HDMI TV's you will need to plugin the Google Chromecast to an electrical outlet to get power (AC adapter included).  YouTube and Netflix both load up fast on a 10mb/s connection, contrary to other reports.  1080p looks as good as DirecTV.  Hopefully as time goes on, new apps will be added.  For $35 this is a home run!
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|Not too much fun and pretty slow.  A bit of a waste of space - not much action or entertainment at all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that this is on the kindle now!!! I am so addicted to this game! Now I can play it on my kindle more then on my phone.
B00BD6EJRK|3.0|I edited with this app fine by when  I tried to do a collage it won't let me . I can't put pictures from my kindle gallery in it. I can take a new pic but not incorporate saved one's. It gives stopped working msg
B0097EWK3A|4.0|It kept my interest in this case<br />I am looking forward to the next generation of this case<br />I am hoping that it is as this case
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|Nail gun is not as heavy as the gun it is replacing, has a nice grip and a nice feel to it.  Makita tools are well made and I have had good luck with them.
B000MDDSB8|1.0|I find it amazing that anyone would produce such a piece of junk!!!  Do not waste your money!!  Bad bad !
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Twilight fans beware: these are not the sparkly sappy vampires you are used to. Dracula is the real deal. If you want a magical fairy tale love triangle romance novel then this book is not for you. Dracula is the one that started it all and is the prototype for all those soft glittery excuses for vampires floating about nowadays. He is evil. He is a maniacal genius. He rips people's throats out without as much as a backward glance. He can control wolves and has power over people's minds. When I read this book I have to hide under the covers with a flashlight for fear that Dracula will flap up in his bat form and see me through my window. If you want to be challenged by some beautiful late-19th century diction and simultaneously be scared out of your mind, then this is the novel for you.
006202406X|5.0|Okay, if you have not read the first two book in this series, START there, with Divergent and read no further in this review! If you are looking to as to how the book is before you buy it ... YES! READ IT!! I will let you know right up front that this book was an emotional zip-line that you MUST ride! To sum it up in the only way I can is this .... Veronica Roth has balls of cold hard steel! My hat is off to her! Bravo!<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ***<br /><br />Dear Ms. Roth,<br /><br />  I would like to personally say THANK YOU for keeping it real and having the cojones to do what you felt was needed to keep the story true to itself. I have no doubt that you knew good and well people were going to react in a not so favorable way, and yet you still remained true to the story and I can not express how \\"upsettingly awesome\\" it was to read! I cried, I rejoiced, and I found myself believing in hope. Life does not always have a happy ending, and I believe Tris and Four remained true to their characters all the way to the last word of the novel! So thank you, so very much, for giving me a story whose ending was a great reminder that integrity, courage, and being true to one's self, sometimes for the greater good, is the most honorable testimony to one's life there is. It was a beautiful, bittersweet ending to an amazing series. Thank you!<br /><br />A fellow artist, and now unyielding fan,<br />Rhea Cryingwolf
B00ECUARO8|3.0|It was OK better ending would of made the movie more enjoyable storyline was predictable acting was fair yeah just OK
B003M6EAXM|5.0|love it loved it loved it what else is there to say Jack Baur rocks. best show ever put on TV
B0038ZITIE|5.0|There is so much to love about the corny and awesome version of flash gordon.  The characters, the bad acting and the marginal special effects coupled with queen music is so much fun.  My entire family loves this movie and the kids put it on repeat.  Visually the movie is stunning, and has a 70's kinda feel to it, but the story and the great casting for this make it a marvelous flick.  Timothy Dalton (yes James Bond) and Max Von Sedow as Mind rock!
B0049J0DC8|5.0|This is classic pixar. Fun for the whole family. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are great as Buzz Light year and Woody.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm stating it now, spoilers!<br /><br />I often read books to escape my life and live another for awhile. But I can't judge a book because it doesn't give me an easy time with that escape. If it make me think and question and enjoy, then I will always read.<br /><br />I sometimes feel authors are never as brave as they should be. They are scared to deliver the hard facts of what a war world is like. I feel the same on shows... Authors or writers are scared that if they kill someone that the fandom praises, they will loose out on sales or making it to the top list. But Roth did what had to be done, she ended the book as realistic and forth coming as it was always set to be. To judge her for making a Dauntless decision is not fair. And I've never felt something as much as I felt as Tobias finally sails down the Zip Line, screaming at the top of his lungs. He was everything Tris ever saw in him and ever hope to experience with him in that moment.<br /><br />A lot people have sworn off this book because why? It'll make them feel something? I feel sadness, hope, giddiness and dread. I feel like my life is worth returning to. I feel like an impact has been made by such a strong and concise outcome.<br /><br />I would have hated the ending if there were no consequences to everything that happened since I started the Divergent series. There are no plot holes or loose ends. There is just what was suppose to be: A future and a History.<br /><br />Tris is a hero and so is Roth. To write something with so much meaning on every page is true talent.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to read the Divergent Series. Don't be afraid to feel something at the end of such an extraordinary story. Be Brave.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Not only is it addicting, it is fun. The pace is just the right speed. The graphics are good. The story line is entertaining and battles are challenging.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Markus Zusak writing is like poetry.  It's insightful, thoughtful and beautiful.  Even if the story wasn't that good his writing is worth reading, but the story is amazing.  You feel these characters and become attached to them.  The Book Thief is a wonderful read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive so now I play for a good hour kindly put it away then it is usually 3-4 hours later I go back to it.<br />I really love this game and I recommend it to anyone who likes a candy challange.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This app is easy to use.. many options included. Was easy to explain to novices how to use it.<br /><br />I would recommend it to all.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Such an excellent show!  It lasted only one season, but quality acting and strangely believable for a show about a crew of space smugglers. The show is a compelling blend of science fiction, cowboy western, government conspiracies, and genuine personal relationships.<br /><br />Sounds bizzarre?<br /><br />Under Josh Whedon's guiding hand, it really works. Watch it. Buy it. Then rewatch to pick up on all the character quirks you missed the first few times. Most of the cast are part of Whedon's cyclical crew of actors and you'll likely recognize them from other roles in the Whedon-verse or beyond.
1250038820|5.0|This is a beautiful book and will make a fabulous gift for any occasion. I bought three hardcover and plan on buying a few more for the end of the year gifts.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|Akash does a great job communicating succinctly, effectively and practices what he preaches for demonstration! Im looking forward to my audience feedback at my next talk. Thanks Akash
B00005AWMF|5.0|Amazing! Adorable! Sweet!! Back in time for my mind, the same vibration to my body! Excellent compilation. If you love Sade you must have it!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I enjoy this show.  Good writing, good characters, but some of the situations are a bit far-fetched, specifically it seems as if nothing could be accomplished without Kalinda.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This has many riddles and puzzles ranging of easy to difficult. Love these games that make me look at the whole picture.
B00EO10M54|5.0|I really like Miley's new CD. She has definitely matured from her Hannah Montana days and I love her new sound. My favorite songs on this CD are:<br /><br />-Adore You<br />-We Can't Stop<br />-Wrecking Ball<br />-Drive<br />-Someone Else
B00F91RYL8|4.0|The movie keeps you on the end of your seat,  brad pitt plays his role so naturally it makes the normally &#34;over the top&#34; story line seem plausible.  Not normally a fan of movies with such as theme, this movie keeps you entertained for the entire ride and is well worth the 90 minutes
B004742Y68|4.0|I remember this film being scarier when I saw it as a child, but I still think it's a classic!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Very interesting read! Great advice. I enjoyed the back story of his life. I just wish it would have been a little longer.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I learned a lot from this book.  It made a lot of difficult looking knots much more understandable.<br />I have just recently started making items with Paracord and this book has made it even more interesting
B006M4F67A|3.0|It is okay. I get bored with the game easily. I wish the game was in a larger size, it is difficult to see the small cards therefore you can't work quickly.
B00ESNE696|5.0|This is the best season yet!  I did not go along with Alicia messing around with Will.  I like seeing her and her husband teaming up and I hope to see the family as one unit soon.  Last night was the best episode I have seen since the show started.  It had your adrenaline pumping from beginning to end.  I loved it!!!  Keep up the good work and the best will be yet to come!  Thanks Gina
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I definitely liked this book. The fact that it was already on the kindle helped. However, I wish that this book could be deleted f necessary just to save space on the memory.
147676459X|5.0|I cant believe how awesome this book is. I read the blog, and was very pleased that Allie put in extra stories and way more awesome pictures.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would gladly give it five stars and more if I could.  A great game with loads of fun.<br />Gladys Nash
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Many times found myself reading, nodding, smiling.<br />So many similarities to my own experience with my cat, but also very different.<br />A story with a great deal of warmth.<br />All the best to you Mr. Bowen, and to Bob.  Well done.
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|Lip sync off-movie had to keep reloading-Not a good experience-Have found that the &#34;Free&#34; movies all have this issue.<br />Not real happy with the Prime Video.
B002IDDRT8|5.0|This is the best of two worlds in multiple ways.  The past meets the future in this action packed film where ancient Vikings battle a creature from outer space.  What a great concept! A new twist on the origin of dragon legends. Lots of fighting, great monster, explosions, suspense, humor and just a very light touch of romance. Well balanced with wide audience appeal. Exciting and fun. Highly recommended.
B006PIXKVW|3.0|Lip sync off-movie had to keep reloading-Not a good experience-Have found that the &#34;Free&#34; movies all have this issue.<br />Not real happy with the Prime Video.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I love this film.  It is complex and you cannot absorb it fully in just one watching. Each time I watch it I see new subtle connections  and nuances. The story is intricately interwoven through multiple periods in time. Multi dimensional cause and effect. If you are looking to passive entertained this is not the film.  This film requires intellectual engagement and is thought provoking. The soundtrack is seductively haunting. Cinematography is beautiful and creative. I had to buy it so I could watch it enough to explore it entirely. I think that it was not very popular in the theatres because of its complexity.  However as a video that can be rewound and repeated it is a great engaging film.  Highly recommended if you want to explore substance and not just entertainment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to get on Kindle, I love the game even though I can't seem to get passed number 23 and will continue trying.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|As a take on the Wizard of OZ story this was less than I expected.  I fell asleep on it twice and finally gave up. TV quality production and story line. I expected more.
B0080MPUUK|4.0|This is a good flick. The first half shows Woody in his usual Jewish self cracking jokes. It is well done but this is pretty common for his movies. The second half of the show is much better.  So stick with it.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This is a great action movie with intrigue and suspense. Fun and exciting. Not predictable with interesting turns. Highly recommended.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|In the back of the free pocket calendar books once given by Hallmark, I remember the little list of flowers and their meanings, along with the birthstone for each month and the appropriate gifts for certain wedding anniversaries.  Maybe they are still there?  As a child I imagined the romance and beauty these lists represented.  In The Language of Flowers, Diffenbaugh has woven the painful and damaged (yet believable) emotions of a young woman who finds beauty - and power - in flowers, into a character who overcomes her deep fears and guilt to find a life with love and meaning - a life beyond the meaning of the flowers that sustained her for so long and are still integral to her.  Some of the premises may be slightly flawed and some events improbable, but I was so captivated by the story and happy with the ending, that - just as the various characters forgive one another - I forgave any imperfections. I don't want to make this book sound too abstract.  It's a great read for anyone who likes character development and I think it has suspense - But it is not the book for someone who wants action packed into the pages.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Fun, action packed with a touch of romance.  Great CGI effects, vivid scenes. Definitely family friendly. Giants might scare really young children (under 5) Nice modern remake of an old story. Highly recommended.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|yo doomsday creeper even thow I have no idea who you are I agree that bio war is the best (he rocks!!!)
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Star Trek movies are always very well done! From the first ones with Capt Kirk to present day. Simply excellent!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that candy crush saga is totally awesome! It rules! definitely one of the best games out there  (and this is not Grace Clayton okay?)
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Perfect for family time.  The movie is very well done and the characters are hilarious.  Trust me you will enjoy it.
B009ZQJ0ME|2.0|Interesting premise - but the movie just doesn't work despite a decent cast. Wouldn't be my first choice - but maybe second or third.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best free app. Does all your basic math simply. Can not ask for more on a phone. Better than my G3 app
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I was never a gamer, but I saw this in the app store and thought I'd give it a try. So much fun and easy to play. The story kept me interested, without the frustration I experience with console games and my inability to figure out how the controller works. I'm playing for yhr second time now after getting a few dozen other hos games under my belt. Still as fun as the first time.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Really like this movie. My girls and now my granddaughter love it. My granddaughter watches it every time she comes over. f your an Elvis fan you'll love the music. Very enjoyable.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is a very endearing story of one man's journey to come to terms with his own shortcomings and find the love of someone special.  I loved the narrator/main character.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book! So refreshing.  Fun read, and fast.  I highly recommend this.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This was highly recommended to me by several people, so I jumped right on it.  I found parts interesting and thought provoking on many levels, but just as often hard to follow.
B0058PJ6NE|2.0|This version stops working and it seems the only way to get it back working is to uninstall and re-install. Free ver actually appears more reliable.
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|CSS can be somewhat difficult to get your head around. The author does an excellent job in the included tutorials.
B00902S0IS|5.0|One of  the classic sci-fi movies worth watching over and over! A terrific combination of plot , acting and special effects. Brilliantly done
B0093QHWLC|4.0|Nicely done older film. Each of the main actors do an excellent job of selling their characters. The plot is good and will keep you attention through this movie. This is not for younger children simply because the plot line and subject is geared more toward adult. thinking.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. AND I AM GIVING IT AS A GIFT FOR A GUY. I AM SURE HE WILL LIKE IT.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I fell asleep during this movie. It never seems to get off the ground. Mayhem, death, explosions and such are so run of the mill and ordinary. I know I sound jaded, but as an average viewer, each of the main players have turned out work that is so much better than this thing. I would maybe watch it again if it where free and I had something else to do and could use it as background noise.
0679745203|4.0|study of relationships during and after WWII, thought the picturing of the Indian person who checked out the mines was very good, and also that this is from a perspective of and English speaking person, but not the usual American-at least as now 21st century.  That there is such a study of the relating of the people, i thought very educational.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well done, kept my interest from beginning to end. Based on true events this kept me engaged from beginning to end. You develop a connection with the characters and I kept wondering &#34;what would I do if caught in this situation.&#34; The actors where believable and well played.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. So touching and just fills up your whole heart. John green is perfection.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I really didn't know what to expect on this film. From the previews of a plane upside down, one gets the impression that this might be an action film. This is not that film. Great performance from Denzel Washington, good story line, and a &#34;do the right thing&#34; message makes this film well worth watching.
B00BXI0IHS|2.0|So well written, such thorough research, and SO boring! I just could not care for Alma, Ambrose or any of them really. Found myself skipping pages just to get through the endless chapters.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Totally slanted view here. I am a fan of all the Bond films. This one in particular grabs your from the beginning and takes you on a ride of non-stop action. We get to meet new characters and say goodbye to some of our favorites. Some parts don't quite fit, like the piece where Bond removes some evidence from his body, (I went back several times to find when he acquired this evidence, never could find when it happened), but overall well worth watching. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and cant get enough.  I talk about it to my friends who also play.  My husband kids me about how much I play but I just remind him to take the trash out as these candies wont crush themselves.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to play on my Fire.  Works great and can play with my Facebook friends.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I read book one. I stopped. I read reviews and decided reading it was worth it because it was free. Then I realized what this series really is. It's just like the games you play on your phone. Is it a good story? Yes. Could it be much more thought out? Yes. Just when it gets really good does it ask you for more money? Yes. It cannot compare to books by Rowling, Tolkien, Martin, and Sanderson. This is another author taking advantage of the genre, writing not to create an epic story like us fantasy readers want, but to create a profit off a series comprised of 200 page books.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|An awesome game, so much fun. Great graphics. Easy way to upgrade an advance without having to use real money.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|It is as good as the movie , great to listen two . My daughter has it all the time , I never get it back .
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was interesting, as usual more hype than substance.  I am happy I watched it, would recommend. Will probably watch sequel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The candy crunching switching barrels of fun a free game that will have you hooked in no tome at all on your own  or with you face book friemss
B00F880BWG|5.0|TWD has become my guilty pleasure. Drama, suspense, excellent character development, and an intriguing plot set in a post world apocalypse, make this more than 'another horror story.' Great job AMC.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game and so happy it's come to kindle that everyone is getting one for Christmas. Thank you<br />Love it really
B008EL25LE|4.0|The gameplay is very fun but can get repetitive after a while. The graphics are good and the different kinds of puzzles will have you thinking of new ways to solve them. The story is there to give some sense to the puzzles but you can pretty much ignore it.<br /><br />Overall, it's fun and entertaining... at least for a while.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I loved this book, made me laugh a lot, I couldn't stop reading<br />The story is fiction but somehow you wanted to be truly real
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My kindle fire hd was loading slow and acted like it had a virus.When I found this app and purchased it I ran it right away.Now it's working like new again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had this book on my Kindle for some time and was looking forward to the read; I found it just &#34;so-so&#34; -nothing really special.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I can't get the app to load. I've tried to download the app twice. But it will only load about 50% then closes automatically.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i WAS SO HAPPY WHEN KINDLE FINALLY GOT CANDY CRUSH.  ITS SO ADDICTIVE AND I WAS TIRED OF PLAYING ON MY PHONE,  REALLY LOVE THIS GAME AND MY KINDLE FIRE HD IS FANTASTIC.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This game brought back alot of memories growing up and playing pinball machines. I use to play them for hours upon end and this one I tend  to play right much. I think you will enjoy it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Hated to see the book end.  Hope the third book is out soon.  It was very good reading. I would consider it historical fiction.
B005DOKK7Q|3.0|The product was great, but it did not fit my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet.  It was exactly what I was looking for unfortunately I cannot use it.
B00G8YZ48K|2.0|The show has gone downhill, now its more about drama between people rather than survival. 3 episodes in and almost nothing has happened.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great book ! One of my favorite from the series. Very on your toes type of book ! Must read series
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is too addictive I have lost to much time off my life...haha I like this game because it lets you connect with facebook and see were your friends are.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  As a psychologist I can also add that the description of Don his thinking behaving as an  Autistic/ Asperger is dead on.  The book simultaneously funny, warm hearted and wise.
B008220DIC|5.0|It's not about the plot, it's about the journey and the characters. The acting is phenomenal, the shots are exhilerating. Filmmaking at its best.
B00DDQTKHM|4.0|I think it is great that he has done so well - obviously, or else I wouldn't be reading this book. However, I KNOW he has done well, but he will say so at least every few pages. Nonetheless, I am picking up some great information.
B00942Y35S|5.0|This was a surprisingly good movie. I can't believe I never heard of it before. I would recommend it to everyone.  Very family friendly with a great storyline.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|I grew up with Harry Potter, and now my son is experiencing the magic for himself. As he finishes each book, I am buying the ultimate edition movie for him. This set was perfect. We will enjoy the extras for years to come.
B00064WSN2|3.0|I thought the price was too low to be the 30th Edition and I was right. I have several other King Crimson 30th Edition disc and they are GREAT! This is just a single regular disc with no DVD or high quality recordings. I love the music though.
B00008O89K|5.0|Got to love the classic Conan and the bad accent. Even with the cheesy costumes and effects, it's a great movie.
147676459X|5.0|I've been a fan of Allie Brosh's (Allie? Can I call her Allie? Is that weird?) blog for years now, so I was never not buying her book. Her blog is less a series of wordy posts about what happened that day and more comic strip about fish murders, spiders, spaghatta nadles, and the single strangest childhood since Drew Barrymore's.<br /><br />Her book? It's an offline edition of her blog. So in other words, it's just about perfect. Some new...chapters? Posts? What do you even call these? Anyway, parts of the book are new, others are from the blog, all put together in something approaching a coherent narrative. I'm not terribly upset about blog posts being included in the book. It wouldn't make sense without some of them, and some others are just so good and so well-known that to leave them out would make the book incomplete.<br /><br />It's much bigger than I had expected, containing a good eighteen chapterposts from 10 to 50 pages long each, but that doesn't matter because you'll read the whole thing in one sitting if you're not a communist. The first chapter alone has swearing at a two-year-old, time travel, and nudity of the most gratuitous sort. In that order.<br /><br />The thing about this book (and Allie's blog) is...beyond the laughs, she's actually really good. Her two posts on what depression is like (both included here) are the best explanations I've ever seen. And what look initially like simple stick figure drawings are actually surprisingly detailed illustrations that convey a full range of emotion. The art is good, the stories are fantastic, and her telling of them is what makes it all work. Most importantly of all, the cover is a pleasing shade of yellow.<br /><br />Buy a copy for yourself. Buy one for the office, one for the house, one to keep in the gentleman's closet, one for your neighbors, one for everyone you know for Christmas. You'll like it, they'll like it, it'll class up both your workplace and your toilet.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Every book BILL BRYSON writes I<br />Is both interesting and enjoyable including this one, however<br />AT HOME  is my favorite.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|\\"The Blind Side\\" was one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. Sandra Bullock, always a great actor who can adapt to a wide variety of rolls, does an outstanding job of portraying Leigh Anne Tuohy, the socially upper-class Memphis society woman who has compassion on Michael Oher, the overgrown kid from the projects, and who not only adopts treats him as a member of her own family but gives him the strength and courage to believe in himself. Quinton Aaron, in his debut as a lead actor, plays the part of Oher in a way that is truly believable.<br /><br />But the acting is just part of what makes this a great film. The true story of a woman who is willing to step way out of her comfort zone and put her life and reputation on the line for a kid it would be easy to ignore (or fear) is more than just heartwarming. It is a testimony to what can be accomplished if one is willing to put his or her principles into action. It is also a testimony to how far someone who has come to believe in himself because someone else believes in him can go in life. (Although we know the end result before the movie begins--namely, that Michael Oher eventually will be a first-round draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens--this in no way detracts from the suspense and the excitement of the movie itself.)<br /><br />This is not just a movie for the football fan. In fact, Oher's skills as a football player are simply the background for the main storyline and the message the film conveys.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it links with my Facebook game.  Most of my friends play. Very challenging and addicting. Once you start, beware you can't stop......unless you run out of lives.  Good thing most of my friends play.. I think there is a strategy to the game just have not figured out the secret yet.  Any tips will be welcome.  YOU will love it.  Get it before it goes away again as a mobile app.  Does extremely well on my KINDLE FIRE.

140006922X|1.0|This book is absolute trash.<br /><br />You do realize that the author is a devout Muslim right? How unbiased do you think a devout Muslim is going to be when writing a book about Jesus Christ?<br /><br />Imagine is a devout catholic or Jew wrote a book about Muhammad. there would be riots in the damn streets and the liberal media would say it was justified. Yet this brazen insult to Christianity passes by as if it were scholarly work.<br /><br />How far you have fallen mankind.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|Wow! There's so much power in this short story, it blows me away. Duncan Whitehead is a great writer and this story An Actor's Life is a quick read. You will want to put the time aside to read it through in one sitting once you meet Terry Sparkes, the actor. First I liked him. Then I disliked him. Then I felt sorry for him. My emotions were everywhere. It's amazing that a writer can create that much emotional turmoil in a short story. As a wordy person who has to edit a lot, I feel this is truly a gift.<br /><br />Why I think this story is a good read for everyone who breaths on this earth, no matter your path, is because there are many life lessons in this story. Of course, it depends on where you are in your life what you take from it. Throughout, Terry Sparkes is a huge fan of another actor, Sir Michael Brookes who is up for two more Oscars. He, of course, is rooting for Mr. Brookes and can't wait until Oscar night.<br /><br />The ending will throw you I'm sure. I love to guess the endings along the way not just of books, but also with crime shows. Sometimes I'm right on, but this time I have to say I was shocked. What a clever ending.<br /><br />This book has prompted me to definitely place Mr. Whitehead on my list of reading material. I high recommend this short story. Don't miss it!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read just about everything King has written over the years and some how the gore does not stand out like the insightful pearls that course through his work, those passages of profound beauty that put this author in a league of his own. A paradoxical writer whose girttyness is matched by his insights.  Some times I will be reading waiting for the net exciting suspenseful vignette,  and something so absolutely beautiful and profound will jump off the page at me I an struck dumb, and go and re read it over and over. I have always said I am going to re read all his books and pull out all those beautiful phrases and pages.<br />this story can be read with or without the shining. I read the shining so many years ago it hardly registered but the main character, Dan so very real to me. the story line seems so entirely plausable while reading .It is only after finishing the book  upon reflection I say yes that was scinecefiction, No that just could not have happened.  Or could it????  the only thing I dont like about a Stephen King book is that the story has to end.  I wanted to read this story forever.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was a really big fan.<br />If you're like me, you have been waiting with great anticipation for the final book to come out. I was so excited the day it finally auto-loaded to my Kindle! I start reading, so ripe with anticipation, and then bam....alternating views for Tris and Tobias. Hmmm, okay, let's see how this goes? Excitement back on, a bit more reading and..wait a minute, how much just happened so fast and why did that person just die again?! Okay, no problem, omitting long details and story line to get to the good stuff....reading, reading, reading, minimal action, kissing, angry, making up, kissing...lack of detail, rushing the story, who cares about that, about time that happened (where is the excitement, I'm almost done here) and finally! Here we go!! WTH?!?!? Why did that happen, wait, that makes no sense! That's not \\"shocking\\" it's just unnecessary and depressing! That's the end, oh that's BS, what a waste!<br />That was a couple days ago. Read the reviews and you'll get the gist, the ending is downright frustrating, disappointing and unnecessary! The book is sparatic, rushed, leaves a lot of questions (that you really don't care what the answer is) and did I mention the ending will infuriate you to know end!!<br />The other reviews really sum it up, I was a huge fan until the end and I can honestly say that is now gone. If you are going to read this, and chances are you will since you read the first two, then please just stop and the end of Chapt.43, assume all the plans worked (I'm not saying they didn't) and save yourself the destruction of this otherwise great series. I know this only make you want to read it more, but please save yourself, as the rest of us are already destroyed! Too bad =-(

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Allegiant is a terrible disappointment. Incoherent, preachy, sad but not in that good-n-dark-dystopian way - just sad. Sad characters, sad circumstances, sad writing. Where did Four's balls go? Why make Tris a harpy? Ugh & double ugh. I really enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent so I was very eager for the big ending. It just drags and drags and drags. Ms Roth - please do a do-over. Just throw this one out and re-write it right.

006202406X|1.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I've never rated a book before but felt the need to in this case.  I would rate the first 90% of this series 5 stars without a question, perhaps my favorite of all time.  The last 10% ruined my entire experience, I would give it 0 stars if I could.  The worst part is, I loved the third book up until the end.  Not only did the end ruin the third book, it ruined the entire series.  It's so upsetting because if there was even an average ending, this may have become my favorite trilogy of all time.  The ending was so uncreative, so predictable (in the worst way), and so depressing that it made me upset on multiple levels... Not just about the characters and the ending itself but upset with the author for destroying what could have been such a great work.<br /><br />After reading the first two books, I recommended the series to everyone I knew.  Now I feel horrible that I dragged them into this.  I would warn anyone who hasn't started reading this series not to get involved, there is nothing worse than investing your time, energy, and emotion into a storyline that ends so poorly.  Even if you've read the first two books, I'd argue that you shouldn't read this one and just create your own ending, anything you think of will be bette than the ending VR chose.<br /><br />VR's explanation of why she killed off Tris makes me even more upset because she could have had a deeper, more meaningful ending that did even more justice to story without killing her.  How about giving Caleb a chance to redeem himself and save Tris at the end to show his ability to overcome his fears, not be a coward, right his previous wrong, and demonstrate himself as a more complex character?  How about showing that Tris could learn not only the lesson of what true sacrifice is but survive, truly learn the lesson of how valuable life is, and learn deeper lessons about life in the long-term?  VR said she didn't want Tris to just \\"ride off into the sunset after saving the day\\"...Who said that was the only option?  There are so many options for an ending where Tris plays a major contributing role to society utilizing her many talents and demonstrating her complexity as a character through her ultimate path in life.  I can write about the options for pages and pages... So many better ways to end it than how it did.<br /><br />As uncommon and unlikely as it is, I can only hope that VR publishes an alternate ending.  In a way, I think she owes that to her fans and her readers if she cares about them at all.  There is a 0% chance that I'm watching these movies if they're going to end the same way.  VR is setting herself up for some massive backlash and criticism if millions of people watch these movies only to be setup with this same level of disappointment at the end...
B00F880BWG|5.0|Love this show!! It keeps getting better and better!! Great cast, terrific story lines...and it doesn't get better than Daryl and Sheriff Rick!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|My husband and I love this series, and yes, partly because David Attenborough rocks! His voice is the best narrative for this as it's easy to listen to and peaceful. The filming is jaw-dropping and it's the kind of dvd you can watch more than once. I would recommend this item.

B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|I enjoyed the firm a great deal and liked some of Grisham's other novels okay.  This one was not well written at all, it was slow, plodding and there was a lot of legal stuff, and how to do it on an estate litigation and very little in the way of an entertaining or compelling story.  Very little to advance the story and the characters were not too interesting.
B000MVIAUY|5.0|Favorite show! Jensen ackles forever! :) I'm a dean fan forever! He's amazing! I love this show and could watch it all day everyday!

The product was in excellent condition.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to my family and friends.  The acting in it was superb.  I hope that more  movies like this one will be made in the future.  It is a film that demonstrates what Christ can do in our lives if we let Him.  It speaks of salvation through faith in Christ and how our heart is changed in a new relationship with the living God.

B00BWQW73E|3.0|Brad Stone did a lot of research and the result is a glimpse into the history of one of the world's most exciting companies.  More than 300 interviews with current and past employees -- myself included -- netted an intriguing collection of stories.  More significantly, his book communicates an important set of business principles and a taste of the difficult decisions Jeff Bezos made along the way.<br /><br />I'm currently retired, but spent 10 years working alongside Jeff and the incredible team he assembled, so I have first-hand knowledge of much of the period the book covers.  While I found it rather interesting, lots of stories are missing or just inaccurate.  Brad painted a one-dimensional picture of Jeff as a ruthless capitalist. He completely missed his warmth, his humor, and his empathy -- all qualities abundantly present in the man.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Jeff is his laugh.  But Brad's quote from me implies exactly the opposite:  \\"You can't misunderstand it,\\" says Rick Dalzell, Amazon's former chief information officer, who says Bezos often wields his laugh when others fail to meet his lofty standards. \\"It's disarming and punishing. He's punishing you.\\"  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  In actuality, Jeff's laugh is spontaneous, sincere, warm and endearing.  It diffuses stressful situations. Clearly, Brad misunderstood me.<br /><br />The story of Jeff and Amazon is a fascinating one and deserves to be told in all its complexity.  Even with the details this book contains, there's a whole lot more that's been left out, making this an incomplete and somewhat unbalanced telling of Jeff's and Amazon's story.

006202406X|1.0|When I see a young person post a review that starts with \\"I feel dead inside\\" it makes me furious at this author. She violated the trust of her readers. I am an adult and I was devastated. I almost feel like this was an \\"aha - gotcha\\" on the part of the author. I loved Divergent and had recommended it to others, including a book club....I had purchased it for my niece...the list goes on. After finishing this book the first thing I did was text my sister and tell her not to let her tender-hearted adolescent daughter read it. Divergent was such a great book. Tris, like Katniss of Hunger Games, is someone that showed women that we can be smart and strong...and that good things happen to good people(?!) This book? I won't get into the multitude of challenges (both Tris and Tobias having exactly the same voice, the redundancies, story lines that started but went nowhere, etc.), all of which could be overlooked for a great story.  But killing off the main character? I bet the folks in the movie industry aren't very happy right about now. Going to see a movie when you know the main character is going to be killed off? Ummm, not gonna happen. And I'm guessing the movie reviewers will be sharing the ending with potential movie-goers who have not read the books which isn't going to help the box office. I'm thinking the movie is a one-and-done like Beautiful Creatures rather than what they're hoping will be a repeat of four high-grossing Twilights. And as far as I'm concerened I won't be reading anything else by this author. I don't trust her. Bottom line, this was a cruel thing to do. As one young person posted in a review \\"Life sucks enough as it is.\\" Shame on this author.

1451666179|5.0|I, like most internet denizens, am a huge fan of the blog Hyperbole and a Half.  The first time someone linked me to one of the entries I thought that Allie Brosh might be stalking me and recording my life, since it hit so very close to home.  When she announced that she had a book coming out, I paid attention.<br /><br />Now, it's finally here!  Let me tell you: it is worth paying money for.<br /><br />Many blogs have resulted in a book deal, but sometimes they lose something in the transition to print.  Brosh is as hilarious, authentic, and insightful as ever in her memoir.  Some of the most popular internet pieces are in the book (not \\"Alot\\"), often with more material.  But even more of HYPERBOLE AND A HALF is completely new, never-before-seen stuff.  And it is good.  It is staying-up-late-and-waking-up-other-people-with-your-laughter good.<br /><br />HYPERBOLE AND A HALF isn't perfect.  It helps to be familiar with Brosh's blog, because sometimes things get introduced without much explanation.  For instance, her boyfriend Duncan starts appearing in chapters quite a bit before he gets named.  However, part of Brosh's charm has always been that she isn't too slick, her art well balanced and proportioned yet clearly done with MS Paint.  Another part is her honesty, which was very important when she started writing about depression.<br /><br />Much of the new material does deal with Brosh's depression (as well as her dogs).  She makes you feel what living with depression with is like, and she does it while making you bust a gut with laughter.  At the same time, there are bits that will tempt the waterworks. particularly if you know someone with or have depression yourself.<br /><br />If you're wondering why you should buy something you can get for free, then know that there is a ton of new material.  Know that you're supporting Brosh and allowing her to spend more time creating.  If you're unfamiliar with Brosh, then buy this book and be prepared to fall in love.  Then go forth and buy a copy for everyone on your holiday shopping list.  Get two copies for the dog lovers.hen go forth and buy a copy for everyone on your holiday shopping list.

B00EUS9JF0|4.0|This is not the typical review, but a Little side-by-side comparison with another member of rock and British royalty, Sir Elton John and his new álbum, Diving Board.<br />Let me begin to say that these two records are far above the current music you hear on radio/TV/anywhere else, but I´d like to point  out some different approaches these two highly distinguished songwriters/performers/legends have taken:<br />1- Both musicians have a touring band for many, many years, but Paul uses his in the álbum, and Elton chose sessión musicians (no match for Davey Johnstone and Nigel Olsson). The spontaneity is lost<br />2- Sir Elton´s álbum mood is somewhat somber and moody, but Paul´s is cheerful and upbeat<br />3-While Elton´s may sound like a revamped Madman Across the Water sans the heavy string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster, Paul´s sounds like a Wings álbum without Linda, so in many ways they both are revisiting their past.<br />4- Choice of producers: T Bone Burnett is not really a rock/pop producer, and Paul opted for a variety of mostly tried and true rock/pop current production stars to give his álbum a contemporary touch.<br />5- Final commnets: both performers have lost some of their vocal range with age, but I think both sound better now than 40 years ago......like a good wine improving with time

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Starting this post off, I thought I would lay out my setup:<br />TV: LG 47LM6700<br />Color Calibration: Custom - similar to what is found on forums/websites starting with C ;-)<br />3D Settings: Depth = 15 (50% increase from standard – starts at 10, max 20), Viewpoint= +5 (50% increase from standard, starts at 0, range of +/-10).<br /><br />First thing I want to mention is that the color was excellent.  Bright, vivid colors throughout the movie while in 3D mode.<br /><br />The first 3D aspect I want to talk about is the gimmick/“pop-out” experience of the movie.  While the movie lacked any MAJOR notable pop-out scenes, it does have occasional pop-out moments (especially in the battle scenes).  If you are looking for “in your face” gimmicks all over the place, this probably isn’t the best movie for you.  There are definitely a lot of places they could have incorporated more wow factor in that regard.  The movie has a slight feel to it of having a glass window between the action and your couch.  That is NOT to say that you will not be fully immersed in the experience (more to come on this when I discuss depth), but they really left something to be wanted in the gimmick area (if that is what you are looking for).  Overall, I felt that this did not deteriorate the quality of the 3D experience in any way.  It would have been nice to occasionally have the sword swinging/missile flying at you, but I can live without it because of how well I think they did with the 3D experience as a whole.<br /><br />Now, let me tell you what I LOVED about the experience (yes, I feel this movie really does capture 3D as an experience).  Perhaps it is because I recently tweaked my 3D settings (although I did reset everything to factory just to see if it was the settings and noticed little change) to have a little more depth/pop, but I felt that this was one of the BEST 3D movies I have seen at home in terms of DEPTH.  One would be very hard pressed to find a scene in which theycould not FEEL the depth of the scene.  The use of environment is outstanding and really brings the viewer into many of the scenes.  You can feel the dimensional layers as if you were standing inside of them for most of the movie.  They really use anything and everything in a way that creates a realistic and enjoyable 3D environment.  The rain scenes are especially amazing and really make you feel like you might need an umbrella.  Pillars, People, and particles are EVERYWHERE and add to the depth in a way that is not often experienced.  Things as simple as Sparks flying in-front of and behind the pilots allow the viewer to be engulfed.  I was worried about the underwater scenes (after watching it in 2D) losing depth, but boy was I mistaken.  The use of airbubbles continued to impress and as with out of water, the dust (well in underwater case, sand? Haha) makes you want to run for cover.  As much as I loved the depth, I do feel like they really had a glass wall between the audience and the movie.  It is noticeable especially as the rain splatters n and ocean waves crash into the screen.  I didn’t really lose anything because of those features, and personally, I think they really help bring it all together.  I just wanted to make sure and point that out in case you are someone who does not like that sort of visual effect.<br /><br />Overall, I this would have to be one of the best overall Home 3D experiences I have had.
B00BRUYQFC|1.0|On the very first song he the words are difficult to hear because he sounds l ill me a screeching girl. Very disappointing indeed no matter what Jimmy Fallonhas to say about it!
B0001YRVN4|4.0|When I received the product turned out that was a bit battered deck. It is clear that the DVDs are new and without any brand, but the packaging was bringing no protection whatsoever. In discussing this with the seller very kindly offered me a partial refund for the inconvenience and for him to change my view never to buy from them refunded me everything. If a vendor can rectify his mistake in that way, it means that it is reliable and you can never trust the quality of their products. Thank you.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Once you start watching you can't stop!  Raw, gritty & emotional, these characters draw you in and never disappoint!  They take you on a roller coaster of emotions...
0061730327|5.0|What a great lifestory!  I loved learning about this young man's family, friends and difficulties growing up.  He not only survived but, with his curiosity, was able to discover, learn and thrive.  May this inspire others to do the same!
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I like some of the songs but not all I do like his voice  and the popular songs that i have heard
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This is a really sweet movie, and the best romantic comedy I have seen in a very long time. I highly recommend renting/buying this film!!
B004UPAIDK|5.0|Loved this flick.  One of the must view classic horror flicks up there with Frankenstein and Dracula.  &#34;Who's laughing now?&#34;  Kind of corny very kitsch.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Love the game but the graphics appear bad. I may have delete and download it again. Hopefully it fixes the problem
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Has a longtime King fan, I hadn't read much from him over the last 10 years, as I just couldn't seem to get into his books anymore. This is old style King and worth every nickel I spent for it. Could'nt put it down!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's fun you get addicted quick. I enjoy playing it everyday before work and after work. And waiting on friends to release you.
B00846REIS|2.0|I feel it was trying to be like a 50 shades of grey book. A bit of a rip off.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I love the game. The paint jobs are pretty cool but the robots are even cooler. If you could build your own robot like in the original game.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|I suppose there is only so much you can do to alter the factory engineered sound, through the factory speakers. I've found myself developing several audio profiles and finally realizing that the factory setting has the best (full range) sound. I'm not say it is a bad app, I'm just saying it really doesn't change the audio production enough to justify the effort.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was already playing this on my computer but got a Kindle Fire for my birthday in June and use it more.  Was disappointed when I couldn't use it there.  Love it even more on my kindle.  Graphics are sharper and easier to se
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I loved this show when it was on, so it's wonderful to watch it again.  There are scattered commentaries throughout that are fun to watch and listen to the actors/actresses talk about a certain episode.  It's too bad there aren't more TV shows like this nowadays.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|What a read!  This is a page-turner . . . and in the end a book about humanity in the midst of the carnage of war.
B00BAXFDLM|4.0|This story seemed to be a mixture of Banks' Culture,  Herbert's Dune, with a healthy splash of Le Guin's Left Hand of Darkness. Not a bad combination. I enjoyed it very much. It was fresh yet familiar. Other worldly but human. A good story that didn't bog me down with details and let me fill in the blanks with my own imagery the way that William Gibson lays it down. Good job, Anne. I look forward to whatever comes next.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|What fun to follow Bill Bryson's curious mind as he explores the summer of 1927.  From the astonishing Babe Ruth to the exploits of Charles Lindbergh, you'll learn about the history of the day as if you were living it.
1250038820|4.0|I pre-ordered 8 (yes, 8) Humans of New York hardbacks--1 for me, 7 for gifts. Being a huge design nerd, very particular about gifts, and on a budget, I was making a big gamble. It paid off. I live in New York and all of my and my husband's relatives (the giftees) are in small towns far, far away. Most of them aren't \\"internet people,\\" they'd never, ever, ever follow a blog. For me, I like something tangible. I like books on my shelves, my coffee table, my night stand...I think it's going to be a great, appreciated gift, not just because of the quality but because how HONY captures the city. It's not Hollywood. Some glamour. Some gritty. It's just everyday New York.<br /><br />If you accept it's a picture book (unlike the blog), you won't miss anything. As a fan, I would have liked more stories included, but I still think for design and content it's a solid 4 stars. For someone like my grandparents who don't know the blog, the missing stories won't be noticed at all.
B00AALX5SI|5.0|This was an insightful look into this young woman's life for a year. What were her managers thinking? She is hard working and ever the professional giving it her all even though the constant shows start to mentally and physically take a toll. She even performs through heartbreak. Ms. Perry is obviously talented and appears to be a really nice person to boot.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game. It's a computer classic and I love playing it. It's honestly the only game app I use! Love love love it
B0029VMKJC|5.0|I was the carpool driver when me and five-six passengers went to see this in Santa Monica when it came out.  Everyone wanted to leave except me.  I wouldn't exactly say that I loved it - but it certainly was unforgetable!  I was the only person in the audience still watching it!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is really fun for me because i like games that make me think . So , my only problem with this app is that if u wanna buy coins, theyre kinda expensive for me and sometimes (REMEMBER this is in MY opinion) that sometimes they're a bit hard/complicated for me, BUT overall the app is crazy.......GOOD
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This another very good set from Susan Boyle. I liked the selection of songs. Her voice is still quite simply amazing. I didn't really care for the duet w/Elvis -it wasn't bad just not up to the rest of the CD.<br /><br />My only two complaints (and they are both very minor) are I would have liked to have had 2 or 3 more songs - the CD would have easily have accommodated them. The second is I think the music was about 1 or 2 notches too loud on some of the songs almost covering up her wonderful voice.<br /><br />I liked the new song 'Miracle Hymn' from soon to be released movie, 'The Christmas Candle'. Susan will be making her movie debut in this movie which is to be released on November 22. Her voice was so very clear sounding that it was simply amazing.<br /><br />I never really liked 'In the Bleak Midwinter' but Susan's A cappella version is enough to make me reconsider my opinion. Her voice is so pure an youthful that it was simply stunning.<br /><br />My favorites were 'The Christmas Waltz', 'The Little Drummer Boy, I'll be Home for Christmas' and 'Have Yourself a Very Merry Chrustmas'. The 'Lords Prayer' was also very good.<br /><br />Her duet with Johnny Mathis on 'When a Child is Born' was a nice touch.<br /><br />I would rate this a very strong 4.5 to 4.75 out of 5. Highly recommended for lovers of Christmas music or Susan's great voice.
0765348276|5.0|Inspired by Heinlein's Starship Troopers (not the silly movie, the great book), Sclazi creates a scenario us older folks can relate to.  What would you do if you could get your body renewed at the age of 75?  Explores the ethics of war, of the draft, and is a fast moving, fun, easy read.  Just enjoyable.  Sclazi is a great storyteller, keeps you engaged and you are drawn to the central characters.  Expect surprises along the way.  This and the others in the series are all fun, entertaining and fascinating reads.  Do yourself a favor, buy it now!!
B000FCKPHG|5.0|This is an essential read for everyone starting a project that takes them out of their comfort zone. Will read again.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its a good time waster really,but gets boring after awhile.there's not really anything wrong with it.just get boring after awhile.plus when I play it,I get hungry :P
B00BKZUVGM|1.0|The style of the writing was so different than the others, and the history closes so abruptly and dramatically. I just didn ' t like it and I really loved the other ones. In one word \\"disappointed\\".
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|pretty good for fans of deer hunter 2005 with medium graphics yeah yeah yeah lol deep yolo mc swag mum dash sap
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|super addicting game would recommend it to anyone played it once and haven't been able to stop fuuny thing is my friends had told me about how fun it was and I didn't believe them until I tried it myself
B005544TRQ|2.0|This show is just too busy with individual character behavior, and does not present the storyline well at all.<br />I won't watch the other episodes. Again, boring.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hate this book It didn't help at all I wouldn't waste storage on this book<br /><br />Afford to B-) vs k
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Three stars for period costume presentation. The acting was good, but, no award material.<br />The story did have a very good plot, and it was played out well.<br />However, the ending did seem quite out of place, and disappointing for the next season to come,
B008AIGWVA|2.0|BORING!!!!!! I tried this, but found it to be for a child. I of course unsubscribed. Goodbye to you Ben.
B00B3EJ292|4.0|I found this to be a charming romantic story of an ordinary looking and clever but clownish Italian Jew, who woos a beautiful aristocratic woman in a humorous way during WWII. They have a son, and then the movie takes a much darker turn. Roberto Benigni is literally simply brilliant. I watched with my 11 year-old daughter, who has developed an interest in Holocaust literature (Diary of Anne Frank, Boy in the Striped Pajamas). It was a great &#34;date night&#34;. Next I plan to introduce her to Schindler's List!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Although I like the first JJ Abrams movie more, this is still a great entertaining film.  The Blu-Ray and digital copies are up to standards.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but likely won't read any more in the series.  This reads very similar to the Mistborn series (to the point where at times I felt like I was reading the same book), though perhaps skews a bit younger.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys are such a talented group of artists.  I play their videos and music in my classroom for my children.  I have enjoyed all of their CD's/music.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|having the political concerns of the day interwoven with the lives of people it is easy to come to care about -
B001BANK32|4.0|It was very interesting and scarey.  I saw the movie, and it was even scarier.  I gave it four because I could put it down and come back later, read some more,  and finally finish it.
B001MIVTVS|3.0|I had looked for this recording for years and not been able to find it.  There were a couple of songs I remembered and wanted badly to hear again.  Somehow, it just didn't stack up to expectations.  Some distant memories are best left as just that.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good book, not amazing but a pleasant read.  We read it in my book club and had some great conversation about the controversial topics and different story lines. There's a lot to think about from the different choices each character has made and how the circle of decisions and karma will come back to get you.
B00C4QVQV0|1.0|Already had the non-HD version of this movie and am disappointed to have accidentally placed this order and now have two of essentially the same product with no way to return this purchase
B000J63LS8|3.0|Howards End is regarded as a classic, but I did not find it deserved to be classified as such.<br />There are two main aspects of the book: one is the insight it gives to the reader about English society round the turn of the nineteenth century; the other is the story itself. On the first count it is commendable, but on the second count it is a disappointment.<br /><br />Great insight can be obtained from the book especially in relation to gender roles and relations, class distinctions and the upper class belief in doing good for the lower class, as well as their  snobbery.  For instance men believed that  men were for war, and while they might give the impression to the women that they could fight, in a real battle women could not win as they had no muscles, only nerves. Another example is the attitude that when someone ( a poor person)'s cat is killed, the solution is just to pay the owner of the cat.<br /><br />There are many comic episodes in the book. For instance , the reference to people at Stettin, and whether there is such a thing as Stettininity.  The book is well written, and characterisation is interesting- Tibby is a delightful young man, who is only concerned about what immediately affects him.<br /><br />The main drawback of the book is the actual story. Quite often it was dull and you had to force yourself to carry on reading it. There were also many aspects which seemed unreal. Not to give the story away, Margaret's attitude when she found out what was in mrs Wilcox's letter about Howards End seems incredible. So does the decision at some stage for Margaret to leave her husband, to go away with her sister.<br /><br />Finally, not sure why the book is called Howards End.
B00296A4F4|4.0|Great season to get things going. Enjoyed each weekly session.  The music and dancing makes the show. The Madonna week was the best to me.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Season two was entertaining.  We enjoyed the additional twists.  We are not sure where it will go from here, but we can not wait until season three.  Well done USA!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Have used the YouVersion Bible for 4 years on my cell phone and it is now on my Kindle Fire HD. I have access to the &#34;Word&#34;  at all times.  I also the several of the devotions that are available.  It is an awesome tool that is always at my finger tips.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This is a excellent Zombie MOVIE.  The actors are great in this movie especially brad pitt , different movies  who has been doing  a lot of different movies lately.  BRAD is a great actor and can play any part.  Ms Patricia A. Harris
B001SZ8Y72|5.0|Good humor, great story line. A movie I would not mind watching again. This is one for the collection!! Great!
B000GOUMPI|5.0|I have been listening to some audible books and wanted to listen to Stephen King's new Doctor Sleep but felt I needed to listen to the Shining first, which lead me to wanting to rewatch this movie.  It was easy and convenient to order and watch online.<br /><br />Heeeerrrre's Johnny!
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I wish we'd watched the free trailer before paying to download the movie. I think my husband described it aptly when he said, &#34;It's like watching a modern version of the old Japanese Godzilla & Mothra movies.&#34; Yup! The only difference is that Pacific Rim has no subtitles, and it was in color. Color could not turn this sow's ear into a silk purse. Avoid it all costs!
1451666179|5.0|I got home from work yesterday and finished reading it before I went to bed. I was laughing so much it hurt. Worth every penny!
159562015X|1.0|Product was rated very good condition and the book itself was.  However, it was missing a very integral part...the access code to take a test offered by the author.<br /><br />If there the product was incomplete, the seller's copy should have said so.  Product was returned.<br />As for the author's content of the book, it is very, very interesting.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I stink like poo and pee mixed together with diabetes and prostate cancer maggots and decomposed squirrel to a worm
B00F880BWG|5.0|First, I should say I am a huge fan of the zombie genre, in general.  If it has to do with zombies, I will at least give it a chance.  That being said, just because something has to do with zombies, doesn't mean I will like it.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is an awesome show.  It is torture, having to wait a week between episodes.  They do almost as good a job of leaving you on the edge of your seat, begging for more, at the end of an episode, as the show Lost did.<br /><br />Watch the show.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|Cary Grant is as charming as ever and all the actors play wonderfully with each other in a heartfelt, charming, and moral Christmas story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very fun and addictive! The only thing I don't like is that you always have to pay extra if you use to many turns or you want to get to another level or for a power up. All in all great game
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Can have my computer, my kindle books and games if I want anywhere I need them. Civilization on the go
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I've been reading Stephen King novels now for over twenty years. Dr. Sleep was a pretty good read with a typical S.K. plot narrative culminating with the typical &#34;do or die&#34; climax similar to &#34;The Stand&#34; or &#34;It&#34;. Is it a better or scarier read than it's preceding story &#34;The Shining?&#34; I think not. The suspense was just as captivating; it is a page turner just as you would expect from S.K., but certainly not his best. What is it of Dr. Sleep that asserts its inferiority compared to his other, perhaps better, works in his macabre collection of works? His characterization of an alcoholic's fight for sobriety interwoven with the story line speaks well for his research (of alcoholism, the A.A.'s mode of operation,etc...) but takes away from the energy he normally places in the conflicts between his usually wonderfully written characters and their usually complex dynamics when interacting with each other. The slip between the real world and phantasmagoric is at times clunky and at others, smooth and surreal. It is this clunky, choppy interaction between worlds that pulls the reader away from her or his imersion in the story. This coupled with Rose the Hats ( the main villain/horror in this story) troupe-who come off most times like one demensional hill billy characters- remind the reader that they are reading a story. It is much akin to getting a restless sleep where you are tossing and turning throughout the night and wake up tired and for those reading the book, dissatisfied.<br />  S.K.'s gift is that he does a really good job of pulling you into the surreal and leaving you in a dreamy state that invites you in and becomes a nightmare roller coaster. Dr. Sleep is just as inventive as any of his other novels you are never allowed to be bored with his horror inventions, they are unique to him, and that's great. In an interview S.K. Mentioned his concerned attention to detail in getting a protagonist alcoholic's perspective just right. His son mentioned that he needed to include a scene where the addict bottoms out, S.K. realizing this is an important motivation to place in his protagonist's reasoning for his future actions made this bottoming out scene the driving force behind the whole novel. If he had placed just as much emphasis on intermingling his trademark macabre with his theme it would have been a better ride to take with him.
141694737X|3.0|Received this as a gift. My son loves lifting open the flaps and can identify each of the animals in the book now, which is a plus.<br /><br />However, I'm not too keen on the message. The author wrote to the zoo asking for a pet, gave very vague instructions not just once but multiple times, and was only satisfied when receiving a pet that had no business being in a zoo in the first place. How very fitting to have this so highly recommended by my mother in law =(
1616550414|5.0|Full of excellent sketches, facts, and  fit for all Legend of Zelda fans, young and old! The book is informative and pleasing to the eye.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book is a must read. It is clear and explained many of my own life's experiences. I cannot recommend it enough. I love the fact that it is written by a skeptic for I think it is a very healthy attitude.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Great to have, makes it easy to review films and photos - and tweak your settings.<br />The one down side is the responsiveness. My 2006 COWON D2 player has a better touch screen.<br />The technology seems old - but this is no smart phone, so this does not  concern me too much, all I need is the settings and review - and this product delivers.<br /><br />It should be bundled with the original product.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|I love this movie I'm so glad I made my boy friend watch it with me he loved it too
B00C2IN76C|5.0|A seedy hero who was both a good guy and a bad guy is killed, leaving secrets behind of a plan to devastate the world.
B003204MQS|5.0|This is a good movie to watch in the dark loud. I liked it boy friend wants to watch all of them whoop whoop
B0016BP0PW|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. It introduced my son to the music from The Beatles! Worth the money, awesome!!!
0385349947|5.0|As a professional woman in her late-20s, I found this book to be helpful and inspiring. I see examples from Sandberg's book in my life every day - women downplaying their roles at work, attributing their success to others, and feeling like they don't deserve the position/accolades they've received (\\"imposter syndrome\\"). I have even seen, as Sandberg describes, young women literally not sitting at the table where decisions are made. Acknowledging that women are socialized to downplay our own achievements may help us overcome it, and finally take the credit we earn. I recommend this book not just to women in the workplace, but also to men, as it provides compelling examples of how male leaders can also help close the gender gap in the workplace.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Great great movie!!!  As good or if not better than the first!  Recommended for ALL ages!  Team Oozma Kappa forever!!!
B007SVPZMW|3.0|I personally like something a little more challenging.  This is more for younger kids.  As an adult I can either beat it or tie it every game.
1594204217|4.0|Like Mr. Pollan's other books, this one made me reexamine my eating & cooking habits.  However, I did not enjoy it as much as his other books.  It started to feel repetitive.
1476747016|5.0|If you are a fan of the Pusheen blog, you will love this book. It is many of the same comics from the blog with perhaps a few originals. The quality of the book is very good for being a paperback. The cover is glossy and embossed. The pages are thick and sturdy. The inks on the illustrations are vibrant. The first few blank pages in the beginning are a cute Pusheen stationary.<br /><br />It is a very cute book. I wanted it to put a smile on my face in the midst of a very hectic semester of college. Success! It will be adorable on my bookshelf, and I am sure my friends and young relatives will appreciate it.
0446672653|4.0|i have read Dr. Brian Weiss previous books and i have to say that it gives me a peaceful feeling and quite lite on my soul once i finish it. it makes me feel that i should not get so emotional and upset for things etc.
0743487486|5.0|This book shares with the reader a wonderful way to work with our children.  If you are wanting tools to ensure a life long dialogue and open exchange with your children, this book is a great place to start.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|This was funny in parts but the first Hangover movie was the best of the three. I am glad I saw it though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best.  Game.  Ever.  But beware....you could lose your job, family, &amp; friends because of this game. Could increase smoking habits as well. But whatever!!! It's so fun!!!!
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|The haters will creep in soon, I'm sure, but &#34;Reflektor&#34; is epic, gorgeous and thoughtful work with so much to discover and embrace.  They still sound like the beginning and the end of the world happening simultaneously, only this time you can dance to it.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|As real as a script can be with the best actors performing like it is the real thing. Loved all the previous 2 and this ends the story just right.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This is a great movie to add to your collection! Family friendly!I love the soundtrack too!! I often play it in the background as I attend to other tasks!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We love this app! My boys go check it every morning to see what to wear. Usually because they want to wear something thats not appropriate for the days weather so it's very helpful on my end to prove to them that its better to wear something other than shorts now that its 30 degrees out in the morning
B003A060TW|5.0|Great packaging, awesome sounds quality on vinyl, and every single track on this album is amazing. What else could you ask for? Oh yeah, it's also dirt cheap and the cover art looks great on display.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|If I could have thrown my Kindle Copy of this book away in disgust I would have.  I read every page as a commitment to the discipline of reading.  The author's idea was phenomenal and then was poorly and traditionally played out in her conclusion.  I was sad at the end of the book for the weak construction of the second half of the book rather than for the trauma of the characters.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|saw it on PBS and had to have it as a gift for my mothers 90th birthday party. she loved it too!
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I like most Tom Cruise movies, and this is no exception, it grabs your attention from the very begining, and keeps it through to the end.
B008Y1YK0I|3.0|I bought the Blu-Ray restored version because I wanted to see what a really great movie, recorded on film, not digitally, would look and sound like on my new high-end Panasonic Plasma TV (P50GT50 - INCREDIBLE! and bought from Amazon!), Yamaha RX-V775 AV Receiver, and speakers looked and sounded like. The picture is glorious. The cinematography is perfect. The brilliance of the desert is amazing. But, when I heard it, I panicked because the audio is distorted. Since this was the very first blu-ray (or any DVD) I had played on my new setup, I thought it was my setup, but after checking it out on Amazon streaming, Netflix, TV, and a few other DVD's, I realized (thankfully) that this particular edition of Lawrence of Arabia is gorgeous to view and painful to hear.<br /><br />The sound isn't the worst I've heard, but it is distorted enough that it is noticeable and grating. I'd buy a different version or wait for the next release in the hope they fix the sound.
B00DJ4PIBK|1.0|I was looking for a nice addition to our Christmas traditions and have been looking for an advent calendar.  What better than Lego friends since my 5yr old loves them!  Unfortunately, the advent itself is the box, not the legos - very cheesy.  Returned immediately.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It gives you notifications when you have an email....and I have a kindle fire and it never runs slow it anything like that...very efficient to use...great app..if you're doubting getting it....GET IT.! :D
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I NEVER write reviews since they're a matter of opinions and everyone is entitled to theirs, no matter how good or bad their preferences are, but this book really is a total waste of money and time. I agree with whoever asked if a teenager had written this. This book is so unrealistic it falls into absurdity. It's a classic fairy tale gone sexual. The rich, handsome, millionaire falls for the virginal, beautiful maiden. Come on! Give me a break! I can't imagine how it would appeal to any adult.
1400031001|5.0|The book was listed as good but it was in excellent condition.  No dog ears, markings, smudges.  Surprising as it was a library book. Very pleased with seller.  Recommend.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have this game on the PC, on my iphone, and now on my Kindle HD.  It was fun to start at the beginning again and see how much better I have gotten since the iphone playthrough.  Tons of replay value, and hundreds of hours on this game.  Wow.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the first 10 rooms... looking forward to more. Great way to spend a few minutes... hope the update is released soon.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|A year ago, this was my favorite &#34;directions&#34; app.  But now that Google bought their technology and traffic and map info, I am using the newest Google Maps instead.  This one still has a fond place in my heart, and was my map app of choice for several years.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I first started reading Wool I didn't realize that it was a post or mid apocalyptic novel.  The writing was so captivating and characters voices were so clear. I just got sucked in.  And I hate post apocalyptic novels. Yet I found myself reading book after book from cover to cover.  Maddeningly addictive.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love how I can listen to any radio station in town, or across the country.  I also like the podcasting choices, i have listened to many episodes of This American Life (highly recommend that show).  And this app is easy and reliable and doesn't crash, unlike some other radio app's i have tried.  I bought the Pro version on my iphone, and I can also record live radio on it for listening later.  Very nice app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My fiance and I absolutely love this show. It is so well done, and we cannot wait for the next season to come out. I have recently watched all three seasons from start to finish because I missed it so much. I cannot watch regular American network television anymore because of shows like this. Truly a must watch!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great read lots of handy reflections with inspirational moments it is like receiving gifts from the universe. Much gratitude for putting this all together in one handy book
B00513DGIO|2.0|First let me say that this book has a lot of interesting hypotheses. Did trade evolve from credit arrangements? Is there a connection between violence and credit that we should move away from? It is well written, thoroughly researched, and persuasive in style. The problem is that for someone writing on economic topics, the author is severely deficient in the most basic economic calculations.<br /><br />For example he says at one point: \\"Clearly money didn't arise to make barter more efficient, since they had no reason to barter in the first place.\\"  But a basic analysis of Recardo's law of comparative advantage demonstrates, mathematically, that we do benefit from a division of labor and trading of the products. The route of human discovery of this benefit may be as indirect as his theory suggests, but one can't help but wonder if his parsing of the evidence is guided by a complete misconception of why we trade. He seems to think that purchasing government services (i.e. getting taxed) was a primary driver for using trade. Yet private production is the primary source of wealth creation in any healthy economy. Wouldn't that activity draw more demand for trade than government services?<br /><br />He interestingly argues that the firm is basically communistic because people share resources and don't trade within the corporate unit. Yet employees have unequal salaries, are there voluntarily, and use the assets of the companies owners and are required to return them. He confuses joint ownership and responsibility with communism where there is (supposedly) universal ownership and responsibility. Just because they aren't formally trading, doesn't mean it's communism.<br /><br />This faulty thinking makes you question his read of the archaeological evidence that he presents in volumes. Most of us don't have that kind of background. He makes me wish I could find a solid economic thinker who does.
B006AN78XS|5.0|I love the historical fiction element of this movie, and I usually do NOT like Woody Allen, so that is saying a lot!  I liked it so much that I ordered it so my whole family could watch, and they loved it too!
1742204120|5.0|First, thus is the thicket travel book in my library as it has  1250 pages and is more than likely a travel book that you may not be traveling with. It is really very comprehensive. Outside of a few color maps in the front and a few blue or black and white city or area maps throughout the book there are not many maps and there is no large map in the back of the book such as one finds in many Lonely Planet travel books.<br /><br />India is such a large country that one could hardly travel extensively in a single trip all over the country. Thus I looked at a couple of sections for possible travel as I have not traveled to India. I found a lot of great information about customs, getting around, lodging and dining.. There is a section covering bus travel and train travel, which I found interesting.<br /><br />There is a directory from A to Z in the back of the book and a review of this section alone should give you a good indicator as to whether travel to India is for you or not.<br />This travel guide is well worth adding to your travel library even if you are not planning an immediate trip to India.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved this movie, and our whole family watched it.  Meaningful, and original plot.  A very pleasant surprise with cool plot twists and an amazing storyline.  I seldom like movies based on books, but this one was good!
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Casting, directing and cinematography are great, but the story is getting too recycled for me.  I wonder if the new direction is worth saving.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|So disappointing.  So many stars, so little shine!  I can NOT believe this movie was THIS bad.  Expensive sets and special effects result in zero plot and wasted talent.
B009LDCXNY|3.0|Season 8 was a pretty weak season for Supernatural. The thing that keeps this show going are the main actors, and not because they are great actors but because they are good looking guys. I'm not sure which guy is which, but the actor who plays Sam is the better looking of the two guys. The actor who is Dean is just an average looking guy. I think at the end of the day though it is the coolness of these guys on camera and of course the dark story lines. That said the writing was pretty bad this season. I don't even follow this \\"Men of Letters\\" subplot. It does nothing for me. And the Sam character just won't stop talking about wanting to split up with his brother to live a simple conservative life, and one without hunting things. The Dean character believes he can have no real life, and he doesn't feel he can go on without his brother. For more seasons than I can remember now it has been Dean pulling Sam along, keeping him from quitting the life of hunting demons, monsters, vampires, ghouls, etc. There is supposed this rich story line of the struggle of Sam and Dean to stay together, to love each other as brothers, to keep the family together. The problem is that that story line has been so overused to where it is nauseating. I mentally zone out when Dean has one of his heart to heart talks with Sam. It's just more of the same.  And as for writing, the writers are jumping to the chase. In the first episode of 8 Dean was abruptly out of purgatory. The other story of the Dick character and the \\"big mouths\\" from last season was over so quick to where I kept wondering why it wasn't continuing. The thing is Sam and Dean offed Dick so fast in the last episode of season 7 to where I barely realized that whole story line had concluded.<br /><br />This season we saw Dean rescue a ghostly version of Bobby Springer from Hell. Yes, Dean came through a back door in Hell and found Bobby in like five minutes, and then they were out of Hell and Bobby made it back to heaven. Stuff happens so fast because so much is glossed over. I realize it would cost a lot of money and it would be complicated to have an extended stay in Hell but the pop in to Hell was a bit of a joke. The pop out of purgatory was also a bit of a joke. And of course a whole year had passed and the viewer doesn't feel a bit of that time. That time passage wasn't believable at all. When Dean went to hell the first time it was fairly believable, but the writers just didn't do anything with their story this time.<br /><br />I watch Supernatural because the characters are cool and handsome. Part of me wants to be one of these guys. Part of me wants to live vicariously through these characters. And who doesn't love the gothic stuff that makes Supernatural what it is? The writers and actors go through the motions almost predicting in many stories that they will suddenly not be on the air anymore. The viewers are loyal to the show. The network is behind the show because the fans love it. Too bad the writers can't develop better stories now.<br /><br />I'll tune in and I'll continue to buy the show as long as it is on the air though. Killing off the Bobby character was also a big mistake.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have this on my phone, I play it on Facebook, and now it's on my favorite device ! Thank you king.com....... I'm hoping Pet Rescue is coming soon
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|This album deserves a few play throughs to be truly appreciated. In regards to the negative reviews.... there will always be people who fight change. Those are the people dogging this album for not being like previous NIN albums.<br /><br />If you appreciate awesomely produced music and intelligent lyrics, grab the album. You won't be disappointed.
0547884591|4.0|I ordered this book after reading The 4 Hour Body and being on the Slow Carb Diet for the past year and a half.  The book was interesting, but I was actually hoping it would have more recipes than were featured.  There was a lot of information that was interesting but not really that practical.

B00FAX6XQC|3.0|passes time easy enough and graphics and picture is good. Easy controls for on my kindle and doesn't kill my battery
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Really well thought out characters, as is always the case with Flynn's books. The plot line is brilliant and makes the book a real page turner. She covers all bases when she writes. Very creepy read in the best possible way. Moments of this book will always stay with me.
B00EVW013E|3.0|Slow start, characters were no particularly believable, could have easily been a Disney Movie. We saw Olympus Has Fallen before saw this there was no comparison -- that was a first class action movie; this was more &#34;A Team.&#34;
B00594XOZU|1.0|THE KINDLE FIRE IS WORSE THEN A DELL COMPUTER. SCREW YOU FOR DELETING THIS OFF THE STORE. APPLE IS BETTER THEN THIS CRAP
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Ridiculous underdeveloped characters', weak dialogue, and even the famous erotic bits were disappointing. Probably read worse. This light weight novel would be up there with The Da Vinci Code as an over hyped commercial and very disappointing read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kids and I all love playing this game it is something that brings us together that we all enjoy doing together.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Great capping of the series. My family enjoyed the whole of the series from beginning to the end. The writer(s) and the actors did a good job.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I read many reviews for this and other calculators being offered for free on the Kindle Fire HD and I also tried a couple of the other ones out. This one meets my needs perfectly.<br />One of the reviews I read mentioned that the Plus didn't make sense, but I was able to find that if you swipe your finger across the memory keys at the top of the keyboard, the memory keys go into hiding and some other function keys--pi, square, square root and 1/x is dedicated to those keys. These are good keys to have for college.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|I simply can't review anything by Elvis Costello. I can't be objective. I will always give it 5 stars. He has been my (and my wife's) favorite since we first saw him on SNL in 1977. But EC with the Roots... Do you really even need to HEAR this to know it's gonna be great!? It IS BTW.
B00BE97ONM|1.0|Read the first chapter of this book and deleted from my machine. It was too much.<br />I know that gore and fear are integral parts of books from this genre, but when it gets that bad, it's too much.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book made me cry but I also liked the realistic end (even though it made me cry). Can't wait for the movie
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|This was my first Rebus book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  With so many authors relying on blood, gore and sadism, it is refreshing to come across an author with the ability to define a crime through careful psychollogical and physical character analysis and a particularly fine sense of place literally and metaphorically.<br />Having found the TV series quite dark, I found the book easy to read and was compelled to finish it.  If I was ever in trouble, I would hope to have John Rebus on my side.<br />I now have a standard by which to judge others.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|I really enjoyed this game! The only problem is that I wish there were more levels! I had trouble getting passed a few levels and had to skip them, but that is the fun of the game! The urge to proceed! You should totally download it!! *This game is great for kids ten and up! My five year old sister had difficulty playing it. But I, a 15 year old, loved it!*
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I liked the book.  It was long but very much worth the read. Usual Brown but that why I read it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It did keep me going.  It was hard to put down.  I wanted to know exactly what had happened.  I recommend it.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Lovely movie throughout. Kept my attention and was incredibly well casted and acted. Cried because of shear laughter as well as the touching moments.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Heart pounding, mind twisting, could not stop reading n can't wait to star the next!!! People have compared to Fifty Shades and there is no comparison I believe this story line is better!!!
B009WUBERW|5.0|I love this movie and the first Expendables also. All casts are so good at this movie. Enjoy this at your best time with your partner. Watch it as much as you can.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|I just loved this movie. I watched it the first time through my Prime account, for free. It is one of those that I liked so much I went ahead and bought it. Very very good movie!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The new Chromecast was announced on Sept 29, 2015
B001LM1456|5.0|After watching The Avengers, I went through and watched all the individual movies of the super heros. Edward Norton is a great actor to begin with, but really does justice to this role.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this book down! This book is made for the reader with an open mind and open heart.  I learned to feel for every character as if I knew them personally.  This is a heart-wrenching story, and it deserves its place as a number one best seller.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was surprised at how enjoyable this game is. A time waster for sure but much better than endless solitaire. My only complaint is the amount of time I have to wait to play again after losing my &quot;lives&quot;.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|I believe this movie will be the way we find life &#34;out there&#34;.  The opening just shows what signals we humans are sending out from Earth.  My problem comes with the religious or rather non-religious nature of finding life out there, it just bothers me.  It is one great movie, watch it, enjoy it and watch it again.  You see I'm right.<br /><br />Can't speak about the &#34;Keepcase&#34;  every movie comes with a fairly nice dvd case so, this one is nothing special.  That does not take anything away from the movie buy it and enjoy.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Difficult to read from an emotional aspect. Often could not understand the driving force behind being a sniper. But difficult not to respect and like Chris Kyle. He had retired from the military but died for his country, a hero.
B006S08RLU|2.0|Yep, a wacky French film.  You have to be a connoisseur of all things French to enjoy this and understand the film's direction.
B004G600A4|5.0|I'm a young adult who loves the classics that I grew up with and tend to dislike much of the modern children's movies because they &#34;just don't compare&#34;. Tangled is a Disney movie I would be / and / am happy to add to my collection of classics that I will be showing my children.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone I could.<br /><br />As my review for the specific used DVD I had ordered from here, also five stars. I received it on time, the packaging and playback of the DVD were exactly as described by the seller; a couple signs of use on the dvd case but the DVD itself played flawlessly.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|They come along once and a while, but casting the right actors and creating the right characters apparently isn't easy.  But this is a case where the writers and directors &#34;write and direct&#34; the the actors strengths and weakness and let the characters organically develop. Even watching the series a second time, it reminds me why I loved it so much.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Perfect for my age and everyone<br />Better than the hunger games too<br />Suzanne is a great author i thought all her  books are amazing
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved it! I read this book because of the introduction of Stephen King's new book, Doctor Sleep. The new book focuses on the child in The Shining, Danny. It had been years since I had seen the movie or read The Shining, so I treated myself to a second read. The characters were so well-developed over a period of time. The horror of the story was balanced by how well-grounded Danny's character was. One of King's finest. Now I can't wait to read Doctor Sleep.<br />Kathleen Kearns
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Let me begin by qualifying that I know that the chromecast is designed to only work with certain &#34;apps&#34; such as Netflix, YouTube, Play, and Chrome (to a certain extent). I also know they have plans to add additional content in the future. but I'm not banking on that. Personally, my wife and I watch a lot of YouTube channels and Netflix together, and I couldn't be more pleased with the quality and ease of doing this directly from my phone onto our television. We also have a Blu-Ray player with certain video apps (like Netflix), but I actually find it easier to use the Chromecast since it's directly on my phone. The quality is great with one exception of the sound being slightly delayed (but this is an easy fix on the receiver).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Cheap!<br />- YouTube playlists that make it easy to watch several videos or a playlist in a row.<br />- Easy to set up, easy to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Slight sound delay, but nothing to complain about (my wife doesn't even notice).
B00F880BWG|4.0|The new season starts out slow.  It gets you into the characters and what's been going on with them without spelling it out.  A good way to start the new season.  Seemed like something was missing but I can't place what it was.  Still, very good episode and excited to watch more.
B00008QSA5|5.0|I have this album on the old vinyl but while I still listen to it on the turntable I decided to get a cd and perhaps save the vinyl for the future.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Couldn't stop till it was finished.<br /><br />Couldn't stop reading. Ending was wonderfully done. Would definitely tell my friends about it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|While the end seemed a bit rushed (like, OMG, I have to finish in 25 pages!)...it is overall a very good read.  Both true to life's ugly realities as well as the durability of the human character.<br />it is both sad and uplifting and a great reminder of the difficulty of life without a safety net or an expectation of human charity.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Went back and watched the whole first three seasons. It is such a good show. Just wondering how they are going to end this show....
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I wanted English version was sent a French cover- not impressed, the picture was deceiving, it's disappointing. Thanks for wasting my money
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book had me cringing from the start, badly enough that I didn't get much farther. A book being Fantasy does not mean believability can be left at the door.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|Loved the series and couldn't wait to have a copy to watch again, awesome and addictive show,I love it! Thanks
0399215921|2.0|After reading this book my daughter who is 6 said she did not enjoy it because it was not a complete story. We bought it because she needed a book to go along with her spider costume for school and this seemed like the obvious choice. She is an avid reader and very good with story lines and this did not meet her criteria I guess.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read! I don't read often, but I did love this series! Went perfectly with the first book. Why do I have to write so much?
B009O2XY12|4.0|This was something different and I enjoy the chances.  I like to be challenged as it keeps me alert. Thank you.

B00G32QIEG|2.0|I wanted to fnd this entertaining, but I just couldn'r get into the movie.  There was a great cast of characters, however the bland scripting and overly fake animation made the movie fall flat.  It was only OK for me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shinning was always one of my favorite SK books, I always wondered what happened to Danny.  I really enjoyed the story and the character development of Danny as he &#34;fights his demons&#34;.  This book was a non-stop page turner, I do not want to give any of it away, it was a great read.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Loved Tess of the D'urbervilles. I was not familiar with this story and when I began watching it, I was drawn right in from the first moment. Loved the Scenery, period clothing, and the story line. The characters were awesome and my heart hurt for poor Tess through out the whole story. Her secret and shame was a lot for a young girl to bear, but the writers brought all the raw pain and the brief escape from it to the audience in a beautiful way. I love through Amazon the ability to sit and watch as many episodes as I want  in a row until the very end of the series. I was like a fish drawn in from episode to episode until the final end. Highly recomend if you like viewing romantic and drama style movies. This story will grip your heart and leave you yearning for more!
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|My son loves this movie, he is 2 and wants to watch this movie over and over again.  As a parent, it is one of the few we can handle the repetition with.  We purchased this as a streaming movie which was a great idea, the original Monsters Inc. movie received many scratches from a toddler...now all we have to do is select the movie for him to watch and it is all streamed in, no disc problems.  Again, the move is great for all ages.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Seth Hubbard was dying of terminal cancer and in extreme pain, so it was not altogether surprising that he had chosen to end his own life. Much more surprising was that, the day before, he had handwritten a new will, leaving the bulk of his substantial fortune to his black housekeeper and specifically cutting out his own children and grandchildren. He had also left clear instructions that he wanted Jake Brigance to be the legal representative for his estate and to fight any challenges to the will `to the bitter end.'<br /><br />This book takes up the story of Jake Brigance three years after the end of the Carl Lee Hailey trial ([[ASIN:B003IDMUWC A Time To Kill]]). Jake still hasn't recovered financially from the loss of his house, and the expected rush of clients after the Hailey trial hasn't materialised. So the idea of a case like this, with a guaranteed generous hourly rate for his work, strongly appeals. And when it becomes clear that Seth's family intend to throw everything they have into challenging the will it looks like it'll be a long case. Jake's determined to take the dispute before a jury, mainly because he loves the thrill of a court appearance.<br /><br />The question of why Seth would have left such a will is a matter of hot debate, with the majority view being that Lettie Lang must have been something more to him than just a housekeeper. But Lettie seems as bewildered as everyone else and maintains that their relationship was never more than that of employer and employee. So Jake's old boss, Lucien, and Lettie's daughter Portia set out to investigate the past...<br /><br />Grisham shows all his usual skill in this book - a great first chapter that hooks the reader straight away, an interesting plot, strong characterisation and the suspense of a jury trial with both sides pulling unexpected ambushes at the last moment. As in A Time to Kill, race is a major theme - the general feeling that Seth should not have cut out his own children is compounded by a belief amongst some of the white people that no black person deserves to have been left so much money. Greed figures prominently too - the greed of Seth's unloving children scrambling for their share, Lettie being inundated with requests for help from relatives she wasn't even aware she had, and, not least, the greed of the lawyers all trying to manipulate the case so that they get a healthy cut of the proceeds of the estate.<br /><br />This book doesn't have quite the same impact as A Time to Kill - Grisham has toned down the overt racism of the earlier book, presumably so as not to offend modern sensibilities, but it leaves this one feeling a bit sanitised. However, as a standalone, this is a very readable and enjoyable story. The twists were a bit obvious, I thought, meaning that the ending didn't have as much surprise value as I feel Grisham intended, and the last chapter was pretty saccharin even for Grisham, as well as seeming a bit too rushed and neat. But the quality of the writing, the characterisation and the contrast of darkness and humour mean that this still stands up well as one of Grisham's better books, leaving me hoping he will revisit Ford County and Jake Brigance again in the future. 4½ stars for me - so rounded up.a belief amongst some of the white people that no black person deserves to have been left so much money.

Do yourself a favour and just give them a try. Rick's books are witty, sad, funny, and full of adventure. The writing style is easy going but not overly simple either.

B00FRMCYQ4|2.0|Both my boys love this movie but with that being said it is probably the worst kids movies I've ever seen. I wanted to turn it off after 20 mins. The taco guy really killed it for me. He was super annoying. The story was weak. It could've been a much better movie if it was thought out more

Some of th  levels you zip through and others you are stuck on for weeks! Keeps it interesting! I think it look  especially good on the Kindle - thanks for bringing  it back!
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|Ripping yarn! Beautifully written and a real page turner. John Grisham continues to impress and must rate as one of the best modern writers.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|I always loved this movie but watching it again with my 12 year old daughter was the best experience. Clean and safe entertainment.

Tight camera angles, interior shots to capture the tension on the faces of the actors, and moves that come across as plausible (unlike, say, anything from the Fast and Spurious franchise) will have you cheering!<br />Warning, if you don't handle &#34;self surgery&#34; then give yourself an excuse to grab a snack while Bobbie D  works to pull a bullet out of his gullet!
B00DMK6WN4|3.0|The movie is great but the packaging was ripped. I had to cut the plastic cover off it was torn so badly and now there's really no way to identify which movie it is without opening the cover
006202406X|1.0|I absolutely love the first two books of this trilogy, but the final book was a huge let down!! Thank goodness this was the end because I don't think I could force myself to read any more!<br />sad waste of time and money!
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Great for boys-  just a classic that older kids will love and it's fun for parents, too.  If you haven't seen it, you should.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Love her voice.  I think that 21 so an amazing album...so many of the songs have become hit singles! Marvelous
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was such an amazing end to a beautifully written story. I will miss these characters, but am so satisfied with their journey.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm a total candy crush addict. please don't ever take it away from us. I would be very sad. very sad...
0385743564|4.0|Pretty good fantasy book.  I would have liked a little more info on how the Epics came to be - why only certain people were affected.<br />This is the first Brandon Sanderson book I've read other than his work on the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  I would recommend it to all readers who enjoy fantasy.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This show is wonderful and although i miss the 10th doctor Matt Smith is wonderful. If you've liked doctor who up to here you will not be let down.
B00F35BV64|5.0|A thrill ride from beginning to end!  I hope there will be another installment in the star trek franchise. Keep them coming!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it cannot stop playing it,well recommended did get stuck a few times ,my daughter helped me out. Cannot wait for more
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I love this game, I just downloaded the game.<br />the tutorial is a big plus for this app.<br />I created my first rocket, saw it blast off and it was a great experience<br />this is a scientific experience, not your ordinary physics game<br />highly recommended.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this tv series.  All the characters are great and the story line is perfect. Can't wait to watch season 3.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This story is very full. It answers many questions with few loose ends. I loved it and can't wait to read the rest of the series. I think it's wonderful that there is so much thought behind everything in the story...
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works great. It even wakes up my eight year old. She actually downloaded the app on her kindle first and then showed me. We are not morning people.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am rehooked again!! It's nice having a bigger screen than my phone; plus this game always makes my phone freeze... but not on my Kindle.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We are Harry Potter fans at our house so we are super pleased with this purchase. Having all the DVDs in one case is perfect. It was shipped to my door on time. I am very satisfied.
B00BX3KZAS|3.0|The album overall is just ok. The only song I can really listen to all the way through is Scream For Silence. It's one of the slower songs, but the riffs are great. It's almost as good as Angels Don't Kill. Other than that, the solos don't really stand out, the vocals have got significantly worse, and there aren't really any memorable songs. The only thing I can say was great on this album is the drumming. The song Damaged Beyond Repair is cool to listen to only because of the drums. The rest of the song including the solo is just completely lacking. Bodom Blue Moon is an ok thrashy song, but it gets old quick. Other than the songs mentioned, the rest get old really fast, and just don't show what Bodom can really do. Also, Dead Man's Hand On You is the slowest song they've ever done, but to me it just sounds awkward because it's so slow. I've always looked forward to the solos from Bodom, because that's what got me into them in the first place. On this album, they are severely lacking. Also, like i said, Alexi's vocals are getting really bad. He used to growl and it sounded really cool, but now he just yells.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Personally didn't like the writers style and found it difficult to become absorbed in it. Really had to push myself to even finish it
B006LA6IW2|5.0|This s is the first book I have read that boldly tells the truth about the current war in Iraq. Even more it is fascinating to learn about Seal training and there lives during a military conflict. A special highlight in this book is the comments from Chris` wife.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game for kids and adults!  My 7 and 4 yr old loves it as much as I do.
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|I only went through four of the 'brain ecercises' before I called it quits. It seems like all of the activities are memory type exercises and not especially entertaining. The app is free so I can't complain too much I guess.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series, is without a doubt, some of the best drama ever put on television!  The character development is rich and the story line consistant and enticing.  Watch out, though.  The last episode will probably surprise you, and may irritate you!  All in good fun, though!
0140157352|2.0|This book was probably great and groundbreaking when it was first published in the 1980s.<br /><br />Currently, however, the advice is common sense and if not, it's googleable.<br /><br />&#34;Don't be mean&#34;, &#34;keep an open mind&#34;--there, now you know how to negotiate.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  Didn't like that Matthew died though.  I would highly recommend this series. Can't wait to watch season 4.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Firstly, I absolutely loved this book.  But, it was so different from any book I've ever read before.  When I first started reading it I thought of the parables in the bible...kind of or the old fables.  There is a morality of a people that you strongly feel in this story.  It shows how one decision affects another person's life and their decisions affect another...and so on.  The story line was very unusual and interesting.  In real life people march through their life and often times we don't look back in the past to see what has happened after we have hurt someone, given broken promises, etc....  It was an eye opener because it did show you.  The family the author selected to have the main characters from was dirt poor but they had so much strength of character. This book is a very warm and moving story of many lives entwined together, that just can't help enrich your life.  Awesome book!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show!  Wished it was all free with prime :-) exciting!  Thank you.  Don't have anything else to say filling up the required spots
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy books I've ever read.  I'm 53 years old and &#34;fantasy&#34; is the genre I prefer to read so I've read many other books in this genre.  Hunger Games just grabs you!  I read it in one big gulp of time...raced through it and since then have reread it many times.  The movie is out and I've seen it but the book is the BEST!!  The author really created characters that you could love and know in your life.  It is like you step in the book and feel like you fit in.  The plot is so real and you wish in your heart that you could do the same thing for your little sister--but aren't sure if you could.  Taking one child of both sexes from each district is such a horrible price to pay for a past rebellion.  It is fast paced and seems more horrid because they are children...hard to get your mind around that fact.  You won't go wrong with this one---enjoy!
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I made one major mistake reading this book, it means I'm now going to have to buy the rest of them.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I already made a review of this, but it didn't go through.  I thoroughly LOVED the whole series.  Thank you for offering it on Amazon Prime.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I don't think this futuristic action-movie got great reviews when it came out, but I just watched it and thought it was really pretty good.  And my neighbors borrowed it and liked it a lot too.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I have not had a book in a long time that I finished in a day. I was amazed at how close you felt to Robert during this short story. This was a really good read.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|best album ever！every track just make me sway. anyone who loves traditional pop or jazz music really should got one！
B000G6R7B8|5.0|After not wearing a watch for many years I decided to finally pick one up. The idea of a mechanical automatic was intriguing to me, and coupled with an interesting color, is what led me to purchase this particular one. A watch built on essentially nothing but simple machines and powered by my own movement just sounds cool. I have not regretted it at all.<br /><br />I expected to lose/gain 10 seconds a day and it has done much better than that. One thing that isn't really mentioned is that depending on the position in which you rest the watch will affect the time it gains or loses. For example, I would lay the watch flat initially and it would gain around 3 to 4 seconds every night I did that which is actually pretty good. Some sites suggest resting it on its side with the crown pointed up to lose time. This did not work. However, resting it sitting straight up, so that the back was leaning against a wall or box, this DID lose some time. After wearing this watch for 10 days I have a net gain of 12 seconds, which it appears I'll be able to get down even further with this new resting trick I learned.<br /><br />I think the most important thing about the watch though is the size and the comfort. I think I bailed on previous watches because of this. The case is on the smaller side, but I think this improves the comfort and fit. Shirtsleeves don't snag on it, and my wrist does not feel weighed down. The strap, which is probably the least impressive part of the watch, is SO important. It is very comfortable. I think metal bands tend to irritate, or pull at the hair. This does neither.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially if you are just starting to wear watches. Best part is you have a choice of color across this model; black, green, and blue.
B002H3T3TM|5.0|fantastic vocal performance，big wonderful stage，all these make this one worth it！Hd quality makes me feel like seeing a real concert！
B008EL25LE|5.0|don't really care about the plot of the game. just loved the game play. Thanks for making it the free app of the day!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|good album with some wonderful tracks！some of them makes me reflect some epics！his voice is so fantastic！no one can refuse this one！
B000FC0V3E|5.0|I had to read this book in high school and didn't really get it.  It was our book club book selection and I was amazed at how great it is.  Highly recommend another look for anyone who experienced what I did (still do not understand why this book would be good for high schoolers - oh well)
B000NVIXDW|5.0|oooo！i just can't help loving this album！michael buble is my favorite singer all time！the songs in this album are great！
B00007ELEL|3.0|I wanted to really like this film. I watch a lot of movies-and not shlock. I am quite discerning. This one was an iconic movie that I had not ever gotten the chance to see. It was the Coen Brothers, had Jeff, Steve,Julianne,...and I had just ran across something where they were discussing the \\"zen\\" of \\"the dude\\" in the sense of the character really being something of a spiritual character indirectly. So I got it on Amazon and anticipated viewing it....It was.....okay. Maybe the problem is that I had expectations based on the mystique and word of mouth. I found some parts really funny. I found some things a little...\\"meh.\\"...There were some areas where the performances were outstanding. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't near what I was expecting. And \\"The dude\\" is far from anything Zen...there were no insights in his character,I found nothing really deep or spiritual about him......It wasn't a total waste...just not what it was hyped to be.
B0042KZJR8|5.0|2cds. more songs. besides the wonderful song 《hollywood》，i also wanna prise the beautiful ballad 《end of may》. the other tracks are good，too.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am hooked on this show.  I think the writing is great. I enjoy the blurred lines of reality and fiction with the interestingguest stars.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This is a fascinating documentary which takes a number of unexpected turns.  It is both funny, sad, and frightening.  Definitely worth watching.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one, like the rest, did not disappoint!  Again, I found that I couldn't put a Grisham novel down....
B00APB79ZI|2.0|I'm so sad when I tried to use it when I was done it fell right apart =( I was so disappointed. My big birthday gift and it's now in the garbage.  I'm 9 .  Very sad.
006202406X|4.0|I am soooo not the type of person who reviews anything, but after all the backlash this book has been getting I decided to write one. My sister and I are both fans of the series and share many of our books, so she read Allegiant first and finished it last week. She told me not to read it, that it would make me hate the series. But I could not go along with that idea because I felt like I needed to make my own decision about the book or what would I say when people asked me why I didn't like it. And I am GLAD I did read it.  No, it didn't have a happily ever after, and yes it was sad, but that does no mean that the author ruined the series or that she should not have written it that way because she owed it to the readers to make a happy ending. I believe that the series was ended exactly how it was meant to end and that I am grateful I made the choice to ignore all the hype and anger that have plagued his book. I hope other people who are questioning whether or not to read it will make the same decision. After all, it is only a book and you should not judge it because you have heard negative things about it or have heard spoilers. READ IT, and you can understand the context of the book and make your own decision. Try not to let other people's negativity cloud your judgement and hopefully you will be satisfied with the books as well!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book will stay with you.  Thought about the characters for days after I finished reading it.  It is an interesting moral and ethical dilemma!  Read until 4 in the morning ... Highly recommend it!
B00884GR0W|5.0|Well just wanted to say this is a good game and ask for many more feature updates. I'll save the in depth review for other people
B005HED11Y|2.0|I grew up with the original series. While the modernized effects are clever, they take something away from the era in which the show was originally created. Plus, I have a 60&#34; plasma that auto detects screen format and extrapolates 4:3 picture source to 16:9, each time a newer digitized screen exits back to the original screen size the set temporarily resets itself as well thus the picture reverts to 4:3 while the signal is reprocessed. This only happens on auto detect, the series has to be watched at 4:3 dimension to avoid this issue.
B0093X805W|4.0|I am a first year teacher and read it to my 2nd grade class (all boys) from my Kindle during DEAR time. They LOVED it so much that I am now reading them the sequel. :)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My son got me hooked on the Doctor.  I would say half the shows are fun, the other half can be quite moving.  Start at the first and if you make it to the show where Rose meets her father you'll be hooked.
B003B0JLYW|5.0|Would highly recommend this book to friends! Gets one to view conditional - thinking on a whole new level; such an eye opener!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I was fascinated throughout this entire movie.  You will not believe the size (and location) of the restaurant and kitchen and the passionate man who runs this place with an iron fist yet tender heart.  I fell in love with Jiro and his devotion to his craft of making sushi.  Whooda thunk!  Watch and then watch again.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I love the Doctor Who series and thought this season was great, but because this season is the first in the new Dr. Who, its not as good as the rest of the seasons.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Awesome read, definitely a page turner.  A modern day classic.  Don't take my word for it, read it Yourself!!!!  i've read this 3 times already and it doesn't get old.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is AWESOME it shows how to give patients and  skill. All of the . Levels are fun and cool. I would a least recommend t h is game. And who doesn't like candy!!!
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a fun game, the kids just love the idea that they get to grow things and change the person whenever they want<br />LOVE it
B000VMFDW2|5.0|The actual combat history of the individual Marine fighting in a gory, terror-filled war that all Marines at one time or another determined was so immoral as to make them teeter in the verge of insanity. Written by a man who went on to achieve a Ph.D degree and who taught for 30 years.<br /><br />The HBO series script for The Pacific was probably 80% based on this mans and a Mr. Lekie's experiences (Helmet For a Pillow) as related in their books.<br /><br />The United States today could not field the numbers or quality of Marines today that served in the Pacific during WWII.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is achallenging but enjoyable game.  can become addictive as you try another time.  No cons to mention about this game
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read the best book I have ever read high Buffy Gucci Hecht
B000065K6N|5.0|Always loved this movie, and it is impossible to find in stores so it only made sense to get it this cheap on amazon!
B002RXVOX0|5.0|love this movie. puts a whole new spin on dracula himself. beautifully written and well portrayed. couldnt ask for a better movie
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|i was almost out of storage just in junk files i got 3.5 mb cleared must get it c: c:
B00A6WSTIW|5.0|I would recommend this movie for anyone that likes shark movies such as Jaws. Great movie, cast and plot. Thanks
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written and intriguing! I will read more by this author. Well worth the cost. Five stars are well deserved.
B004K58GSO|5.0|Great John Wayne movie and a great western. I wish amazon showed more like this that you didn't have to pay for.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I liked them but they are not excellent,even so , I want to continue with the forth one....that i will buy soon
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love it great game best app ever very addictive.sometimes challenging but overall good game need more games like it.it totally stands alone
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The most addicive -madding - frustrating game in the world.  And I love it!!  Be warned. You can't quit once you start!
B00280LYIC|5.0|this was one of my top ten favorite books by far. I love all the detail. I would absolutely read it again
B009JBZH54|4.0|This is a great collection of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The blu rays are excellent and look great. The disc booklet and holders are neat and well made and continue the dark blue and black theme as seen on the box. The box itself is less than desirable in its presentation and feel, but works. The accompanying book seems to be an advertising crackerjack-ish prize to entice you to buy the real book it is sourced from. It's nice but nothing special. The real specials, are the special features. Loads of making of documentaries and behind the scenes featurettes. No noticeable differences in picture quality or sound that I can detect from the single movie blu ray release and this when comparing TDKR. A great buy if you want Nolan's Dark Knight in the highest possible picture quality and sound in one package.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Very easy to set up and operate right out of the box.  The sounds is very clear.  No fancy bells and whistles, but just what I was looking for.  Perfect hands-free solution for those who don't want to wear a device on their ear.
B008V2THJE|4.0|Interesting characters and plot. This was one my wife and I really liked. I would recommend it to anyone. Loved it.
0679882820|5.0|Our son loves this book, and has for quite some time. He has learned different sounds because of it to, and loves to interact with us when we're reading it. Love Dr. Seuss!
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|I love this movie. Might be because I love the actors. I just felt it had a good amount of action mixed with an unreal story line.Go in open minded still because it is always necessary to have few expectations with movies nowadays. I expected I wouldn't like it and now I own it.
B0011Z0ZZS|5.0|Great collection of songs. Found the album by accident while on vacation and can't stop listening to it. Well done.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I like to watch random tv shows and I enjoy law shows, so this suffices. Plus I have amazon prime and it is free so I can watch it whenever I want and I can follow the series at my lesiure.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great book I really liked the character development, you really feel like you know all of them by the end of the book.  This book is also an easy read, normally sci fi is difficult to read because the writer needs to create different languages, names of worlds and the like, where this book is an easy read.  Highly recommended and I will read the follow up Ender Books.
B003G4W49C|5.0|what a great book! from the beginning you are pulled into a world masterfully crafted by Card. I especially enjoyed the plight of Enders morality towards the end of the book. I look forward to reading the rest in the series.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|This is a great under-rated movie with  fantastic music!  Original storyline, easy to watch and perfect choice for random movie night streaming.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I have to say Brad Pitt redeemed himself in this movie. Now days when I see him in a movie I'm thinking that Brad Pitt playing a part but in this movie you really forget about Brad and get sucked in by the actual movie. Great job Brad!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|As good as S1.  Jessica Lange is brilliant.  Waiting for :Coven with  Kathy Bates!  I am now addicted to American Horror!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I could read Allie's writings for hours and hours!!!! Need another book Allie!!!! Try explaining to your husband at 11pm why you just snort laughed!
B008EL25LE|5.0|I am new to the android game experience.  Exquisite background, music, and challenging to play. Not boring, has many levels.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I do understand why they feel the need to kill off a right after a baby is born? That are other ways for dramatic ends.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|In all honesty, I was more satisfied with this ending than I was with Mockingjay. Everything that happened was being lead up to, but it still caught me by surprise. The fuss may be that it isn't the stereotypical happy ending... But it doesn't need to be. Life doesn't end with perfect little boxes wrapped in a bow. Sometimes tragedy shapes us more than we want to admit and this ending addresses that.<br /><br />The beginning felt slow at first, especially after the pace of Insurgent, but when it picked up it never really stopped.<br /><br />I do agree that the Four chapters had the exact same voice of Tris, but maybe it's because they came from the same factions? But that didn't distract me.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this book and series.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|Great halloween movie for the whole family. Wholesome and funny. Appeals to adults and kids alike. Grab some popcorn and enjoy.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Loved watching yet another great season!  This show is one of my favorites by far and totally worth the watch.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|This is one of the hardest movies I've sat through this year. It is also one of the films that you must see this year.<br /><br />There has been much controversy from Seaworld claiming that the film is virtually exaggerating their facts. I don't think this has helped the theme park at all, and I wish more people had seen this to see that there is so much evidence supporting 'Blackfish's argument. It is gripping, moving and frustrating in the strongest of ways.<br /><br />This is documentary film-making at it's strongest. There is also the argument that you don't get a balanced argument, and that the film lacks Seaworld's side of the story. But they cover the ground pretty perfectly in their absence, they virtually get every other aspect, whether it be the transcript from the courtroom, or the trainers, or the original capturers of the orcas. This film will affect you emotionally, and will probably change your view of killer whale performances.<br /><br />It doesn't try to manipulate you, even though that is the point of the movie, but it just shows you the facts, and the footage that they have, and it gives you an argument. And I definitely agree with that argument. The film leaves you feeling a little angry and sad.<br /><br />I admittedly went to Seaworld when I was a child. But when you view it from this perspective, it suddenly becomes ludicrous. It reminds you that these are real animals, being forced to perform to people, so that they can eat their sweets and see the funny looking whale perform. It's crazy.<br /><br />I actually found it hard to watch at times, and it just completely captivated me. It is one of the best documentaries I've seen in years, and is definitely one of my top films of 2013.<br /><br />A heartbreaking, moving, scary, and gripping documentary.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Ended too soon. Fast read. Characters  felt real. Recommend  this book for anyone who likes to read a heart warming and a heart wrenching novel
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Was on a plane and saw the opening of Series 1.  Was intrigued as I didn't see the name of the series as I didn't notice the beginning of the movie and the flight ended the show just prior to landing.  Took about a week to  find out the name.  We love looking at the Crime Fighting, Dope Smokin' Lawyers that will do literally anything to win a case.  It's similar to Batman and Robin as a team and their leader is a simply classy and &#34;GORGEOUS&#34; African American woman Gina Torres  as Jessica Pearson and &#34;Smokin Hot&#34; Paralegal Megan Markle as &#34;Rachel&#34;.  The series is written very well we love the dynamics and the twisting and turning nature of it.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Wow...usual excellence in story telling from Allie Brosh. I loved the choice of favorites from the blog. Loved all the new stories. She is a true comedian.
B000I55YV2|5.0|I liked the Mini chase parts, great action keeps you on the edge of your seat worth watching again and again
B008EL25LE|5.0|Nice game and really cool graphics.  Plays very easily.  I got it for free, but would pay for this game.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Not only a great movie and great acting, give a great history lesion for the 60s though 90s, fun to see the way we where and ware we came from.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The best series on tv.a suspense horror drama that pulls you in that will leave you wanting more and more!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Finally a fantasy book where the characters have believable adult personalities. No angsty self centered melodramatic teenagers and no romance novel style unnecessary &#34;love&#34; scenes.  I enjoyed this book from start to finish the whole time wondering what will happen next!
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Outstanding action series about a \\"bike club\\", in Charming Calif.  A show that makes you cheer for the bad guys. I wouldn't let my child watch it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I watched this when it was originally aired, loved it them and continue to love it on Amazon. Anyone interested in English history must see this.  While Jonathon Rhys Myers was not what I would imagine Henry VIII looking like, a little too healthy and lean looking, he did an excellent job. The grittier aspects of his rule are seen with all of the intrigue and drama. We glimpse into the inner workings of court and it is addictive. Highly recommend for anyone interested in Henry and all his wives.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|I gave it a 4 star because you can't stop once you begin.  It's almost as bad stopping as candy crush saga.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addicting!!!! this is a very good way to waste the rest of your day.... hope you didn't have plans!<br /><br />enjoy it while its free
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great. Couldn't stop watching. The characters were interesting and each episode had new twists and turns. The name doesn't do it justice.
1449305172|5.0|Ashs book contains a ton of practical advice for startup founders as well as product manager/owners. It became something like a product management bible for us within a short time and we use it heavily to learn how to interview customers, track our product development etc. etc.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good app is proving very useful on my new kindle Fire HD. Tells me everything I need to know .Well done guys.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book explains what I've been fighting with for the last 12 years, the force that keeps dragging me down and stopping me from creating what I know is inside me. Now I need to put his words into actions.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|Very meaty, long, captivating. Draws you in a stays with you long after it's finished. The painting itself is perfect for the story and you can understand the attraction. I didn't like the summing up at the end, very poor but I still gave it five stars, don't bother to read the last 10-20 pages.
B003M13LJQ|5.0|Look, many people did not watch the full \\"Pilot\\", but that episode did explain some stuff, you have to watch the full season to fully understand the concept of the show, if you did not watch back then (1960s). Season one has Eccleston as the first doctor, (Ninth for the older watchers) Season 2 has David Tennant as the second doctor (10th for the older watchers), one of the best, and season 5 or 6, I cant remember, has Matt Smith as the 3rd (11th for the older watchers)<br />In the end, the first season isnt all that epic, but it has some good plots and story-lines, also introduces some characters that will come back in later seasons, like the Prime Minister.<br /><br />But, \\"Spoilers!\\"~River Song
B00EK0UBPU|4.0|Well set in time and place through very clever use of language. Loved the length of the book. Well deserving of the Booker Prize.
B0089LOG02|5.0|And the way the stories were told, interwoven, but not at all the same.  So hopeful, triumph over tragedy,  indomitable human spirits, persevering through loss, sadness, abandonment, even hopelessness.  Very uplifting, but not sappy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally...candy crush saga available on kindle! Much easier to play than on my phone. Awesome! Fun to compete with family and friends to see who is farthest along in the game. Very challenging...can't wait to see what higher levels have in store.

B00F8LPH90|5.0|While I couldn't down load this to my Kindle Fire (yet)(hint hint) I do paly it on another device and I have fun playing it, when I feel like I have the time, it fun trying to hit them and not the civilains.

0060837020|5.0|I read this when it was first published but lost my copy.  I got interested about the the institution, McLean Hospital, and made a reading list including this. Also read Gracefully Insane, Girl Interrupted and Mount Misery.  So enlightening!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is so much fun. It is completely addicting, for some reason it's not like all the other games like this and it is totally worth the download.
0679746048|5.0|I created a reading list centered on McLean Hospital and mental health care.  I saw this movie when it came out, but never read the book till now.  Well worth reading!
1451666179|5.0|Sometimes you fall in love with an awesome blogger, rejoice when you find out they got a book deal, but when you finally get the book, it fails to meet expectations.<br /><br />Allie Brosh is not one of those people. This book is worth every minute we've waited over the last couple years. It's perfect.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|A fantastic  and entertaining read. I highly recommend this book to all who enjoy fiction. It was a highly inventive new way of war and  mystery in one book with many mysterious beings and lots of surprises.<br /><br />Bob

B001EO748M|4.0|Good series but the actor playing &#34;King Henry&#34; and &#34;Anne Bolyen&#34; are so hard to accept- Just not really believable- Hard to get over it
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|This is something my son looked up himself and wanted to get, and he has now made all of us bracelets. He is enjoying it very much. The directions were good enough that he figured it out all by himself (although he is also very bright, of course!).
B00E7Z7D2M|3.0|My first exposure to the talented Houston native Robert Glasper came through listening to my fathers copy of the first volume of this series [[ASIN:B0067Q04AM Black Radio]] on his car CD player on the way back from a trip to the record store together a couple of years ago. The more I learned about the pianists musical vision and intent,the more it was appealing. It had a flavor about it all similar to Miles Davis: the idea that the available standards jazz artists were using to improvise over were becoming shopworn,and certainly not vital enough to build original compositions from. Glasper was seeking to reinvent the quality of the jazz standard itself for the modern age-and therefore original jazz composition as well. There was no cynical inner critic telling me anything to the effect that \\"So his verbiage and rhetoric is encouraging as to his ideals. Can he musically live up to his visions?\\". Listening without prejudice gave me to hear that this talented jazz pianist was more than capable of delivering-bringing in Erykah Badu and even an odd cover choice in Nirvana at the end. When news came to me that he was releasing volume 2 of the this project,I was very excited and wanted to investigate more of what my father had originally introduced me to. Suffice it to say it was not exactly the direction he seemed to be starting out in.<br /><br />  Where songs such as \\"Calls\\" with Jill Scott and Brandy's dancable \\"What We Are Doing\\" are quality songs,there's something about the approach of this album that...just bothered me. Much of it comes down to generationalism I suppose. In the 70's fusion innovators were too looking to expand the instrumental spectrum of jazz-and were met with a negative backlash by frightened and angry critics confronting electric instruments and newer sounds they didn't quite understand. Yet that musical genre was centered around Miles Davis,a perfectionist who spun off the earliest and more revered fusion bands based on other perfectionist band leaders/musicians. Something about Glasper's musical approach here is a little too safe. While his piano playing and compositions are highly advanced,scaling and often incredible,he seems to settle for an overly minimal,under-produced instrumental sound for almost the entire album. And the Norah Jones duet of \\"Let It Ride\\" is mainly just a by-the-numbers drum-n-bass song sounding as if it were recorded in 1997. The two songs that could've been ingenious in Stevie Wonder's \\"Jesus Children\\" with Lalah Hathaway and Malcolm Jamal Warner and the closing \\"Lovely Day\\",sung with an original style vocorder,sound almost embarrassingly flat and amateurish. The intricate chords and harmony changes of the originals are completely absent in favor of a plodding repetition of the chorus with no resolution whatsoever.<br /><br />  On many articles I've read Robert Glasper is described as a \\"neo soul\\" oriented jazz musician. And that could be the source of some of this albums major flaws as I view them. The strong Afrocentricity/Latin percussion as well as the progressive rock of the 70's funk era allowed the musical quality of the original fusion-from Weather Report to the funkified Crusaders,to stand out very individually. The groundwork Glasper is basing his new jazz standards on here is hip-hop oriented neo soul that emphasizes spare \\"naturalness\\" over instrumental harmony and production to such a degree,a lot of the music is almost completely soulless. On the tracks \\"Persevere\\" and \\"I Stand Alone\\" featuring Common,Snoop Dogg and Luke James have some Tipper Sticker worthy language (this album didn't get one by the way) on it that...frankly didn't contrast with the socially positive and liberating lyrics espoused throughout the rest of the album. Overall this album is uneasy. Glasper plays Fender Rhodes quite well here but never really stretches out on it. Again the key is awkwardly safe music here. Its a bit disappointing to me in that I wanted to offer readers of this a positiveand glowing review. And considering the..well frighteningly negative comments I've been getting on my reviews of late? It just feels nice to be nice. So in all fairness,for what this is it's very competently performed and the guests singers/rappers are all incomparably talented-even as performers here. But in the spirit of honest Robert Glasper simply didn't hit the mark on this album.and glowing review.

B008EEHRAU|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie, it is simple , fun , with hint of drama.  I personally cannot eat that much sweets yet I find it amusing how chocolate is used to save a town. It is not intended to be a over-dramatized piece just light  and fun like chocolate!<br />I have no complaints about this film.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a lot of fun. I like how bananas are the coins of the game and minions are just as cute as the movie. ;) worth trying at the very least.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Not a big Clutch fan when we purchased this CD, but now I am! I saw them live in 2005 and they were good, but not really my type of metal. However, this album is much better. A lot harder than some of their other stuff. I am a fan now!
B0061S073A|3.0|My 5 yr old son has a Nabi but even in kid-mode he was able to access the Amazon app store through his games and make a ton of purchases without knowing how to read a thing.<br /><br />After finding out that Amazon only supports parental controls on in-app purchases but does nothing to prevent app purchases from their app store, I needed to find a way to keep my son away from the store.<br /><br />I found Kids Place and knew it would be great. I installed it and immediately went through and set my pin and allowed his apps. The issue is that some of his games cannot be run within the Kids Place environment. When he plays those games I have to take him out of Kids Place and put him back in the regular Nabi kids area, then I cross my fingers that he doesn't wander back into the Amazon App Store.<br /><br />Kids Place is a great alternative, though and I have him playing within this app most of the time.<br /><br />After brainstorming with an Amazon call center rep, she gave me the idea to just turn off the wi-fi during those times that my son is out in the regular Nabi area. That way he can't access the app store. So for those moments, I will have wi-fi turned off.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love the way the characters are developing and the addition of the new group should make it more interesting. Can't wait until season 4.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The first few episodes were more like their version of a drama.<br />About 1/3 the way through it got back to its usual humor.<br />In summary it was worth getting.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Love this show can't wait to see season 9th. Love the way the characters develop along the journey too there are always surprises around the corner.
B007TKBD4G|5.0|So I had heard two or three songs from the album and decided to give the full album a shot since I really liked the tunes.<br /><br />From beginning to end their music makes you happy.  I replayed the vinyl about three times since I fell in love with all of their songs.  I will have to back track and grab their previous album now as well.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I am a huge fan. This series has loads of action and a fantastic cast of characters. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The ability to put my computer in the tv is amazing and for the price it can't be beat. The issue is when you stream sports it is laggy and jitters even on the highest quality stream.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  It felt like I knew the characters . That's a good writer ! Don't make writting reviews difficult  . Except what reader writes
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|As a huge fan of Donna Summer, I was very excited to get a copy of this new album of new remixes. Out of 13 tracks, I was able to easily appreciate the beauty of 10 tracks from the album. In fact, this album could have just contained only 10 tracks and nothing else. Except for a new song \\"La Dolce Vita,\\" all other classic Donna songs like \\"Love To Love You Baby,\\" \\"Hot Stuff,\\" \\"Bad Girls,\\" \\"Sunset People,\\" MacArthur Park,\\" and 2 versions of \\"I Feel Love\\" are given a fresh reworking. I was expecting to be disappointed with \\"Last Dance\\" but, believe it or not, I was not disappointed at all. In fact, I liked the reworking of this classic very much. However, my personal favorite is \\"Love Is In Control\\" which is the very first remix I heard on You Tube months ago prior to the Oct. 22 release. I must admit I was totally blown away with the new version because it was a refreshing new version of the original Quincy Jones classic with a great arrangement while still keeping those original, fantastic Donna vocals. Here are the album's 10 best tracks:<br /><br />1. Love To Love You Baby (Giorgio Moroder feat. Chris Cox Remix) 4:21 - top 5 pick.<br />2. Hot Stuff (Frankie Knuckles and Eric Kupper As Director's Cut Signature Mix) 5:59 - top 5 pick (a big favorite).<br />3. I Feel Love (Afrojack Remix) 5:59 - one of the noisiest remixes ever!<br />4. Love Is In Control (Finger On The Trigger)(Chromeo and Oliver Remix) 4:01- top 5 pick (my original favorite).<br />5. Sunset People (Hot Chip Dub Edit) 7:38 - kinda anemic version of the original.<br />6. Bad Girls (Gigamesh Remix) 5:22 - top 5 pick (my personal favorite after hearing the remixes over and over again).<br />7. MacArthur Park (Laidback Luke Remix) 5:40 - quite good remix!<br />8. I Feel Love (Benga Remix) 7:13 (more of a dub version which does not feature the whole song).<br />9. Last Dance (Masters At Work Remix Short Version)6:30 - top 5 pick (another favorite).<br />10. La Dolce Vita 4:13 - wonderful collaboration ofDonna and Giorgio.<br /><br />Well, what can I say about the three (3) other tracks aside from the fact that they don't belong or have any place in this remix album?<br /><br />1. Dim All The Lights (Duke Dumont Remix) 6:01<br /><br />This remix should have been titled \\"Dance Your Heart Away\\" because this is what you hear repeatedly and irritatingly throughout the song (and some \\"dim the lights sweet darling\\"). While this song started promisingly with a great beat, it continues doing so until the end of the song without any highs or lows. In fact, we don't even hear the whole song or even parts of it! This is truly a lost opportunity to come up with a great remix.<br /><br />2. Working The Midnight Shift (Holy Ghost! Remix)5:29<br /><br />This could have been a great Donna Summer remix with a great beat and a wonderful arrangement but, unfortunately, we don't hear Donna's vocals on this song. Oh my! So why is this song included in this album and credited to Donna Summer? Instead they used someone else's voice (a certain Tiffany Roth). Why??? I really wonder why Executive Producer Bruce Sudano allowed this injustice to happen. Holy Ghost! Maybe they should have just included that \\"Our Love\\" remix in place of this.<br /><br />3. On The Radio (Jacques Greene Remix) 5:58<br /><br />Finally, this remix, in my opinion holds the distinction of being the worst Donna Summer remix I have ever heard! The remixer murdered the classic song! During the first minute of the song, I thought I was given a defective cd by Amazon but I realized it was part of the remix. I could not stand hearing \\"On The Radio\\" with Donna's vocals sounding like she was being drowned and sounding like a broken record. What an insult to the vocals of my beloved diva! This remix is fit for drug addicts getting high on drugs who think noise is music. This remix does not deserve to be in this album or any other Donna Summer album, or any album for that matter (but there was a reader who actually loved thismix).<br /><br />Most of the reviews on this remix album have been predominantly harsh and unfair to the producers. While this is not a perfect remix album with at least 3 bum tracks, the rest of the remixes are not bad at all. As a huge Donna fan, I have derived extreme joy and pleasure listening to reworked versions of Hot Stuff, Love Is In Control, Love To Love You Baby, Bad Girls and Last Dance. Repeated listening has made these remixes grow on me. Imagine Donna's immortal vocals on new arrangements of her classic hits. It's like Donna has lived again and the listening experience simply brought tears to my eyes.
B001NA2NM4|3.0|Very old fashion. Not clear as to what they were up to. Story line was strange. Guess we are spoiled by today's better scrip writers and photography.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was disappointed to learn that Danny took up drinking; I thought he knew better. Then again, we often know as kids what is white and what black... and then life happens. It's not always pretty, and it's often scary, but it's real, and so is this Dan. Thank you, Mr. King, for another great story with bright, scary colors. But thanks most of all for letting us see that white is the brightest.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|What a compelling series!  It hooks you and leaves you wanting to know more. It is not appropriate for all ages because of violence and sexually explicit scenes.  Actually, the violence is a little too graphic so be sure to consider this before watching.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Arctic Monkeys manage to outdo themselves yet again with AM.  As hard-working a band as you'll find, they manage to mature and adjust their sound (thanks to some unpredictable, diverse influences) and with each album but produce top quality.  A great mixture of tempo, style with consistency of Turner's unparalleled song-writing with ever-maturing presence, Helders' highly-praised drumming, Cook's skillful guitar riffs, and O'Malley's superb and highly underrated bass.  Arabella, Knee Socks, and Do I Wanna Know? stand out the most for me.
B00ET3VHZG|2.0|There doesn't seem to be any difference in the difficulty levels. Even &#34;newbie&#34; is very difficult. It needs some fine tuning.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|great followup to a great first novel! can't wait for the next one!  read it in 4  days straight. love it!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great book! So many twists and turns and sneaky plots with unexpected deaths can't wait to read the next book loved it!
B00C3N9J7C|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Fields and this follows in the exact same vein. It's a classic sophomore album that doesn't seem as comfortable in its own skin as the first effort did, but it's safe to say if you liked the first album, you'll like this. The continuation of mellow melodies, artful but sometimes uncomfortable distortion, and haunting vocals still make this a winner and worth a place in your music rotation.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I don't normally buy albums as only a few songs are actually even good. This album is more than amazing, I think I've heard all their song on the radio at one point (which is pretty amazing). I'm not even the biggest country fan, but this country rock is becoming huge. For $10 plus the mp3 versions this was a must buy and I highly recommend it over buying just one or two tracks through mp3!
B0015GDVTU|4.0|Loved the characters...<br />I'm planning the letter campaign ( for my family) even though I'm not hosting an aneurism ... that I know of...
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I loved this game!!! For a phone game this has a lot of depth and is addicting. The first time I played it I spent 5 hours on it, 5!!! that's for a phone game that cost $2.50. So needless to say I felt like I got my moneys worth in the first swing.<br /><br />The game is about you running a gaming company. You hire and train employees to help develop video games. As you play new technology, new consoles, and new game types open up. There is a sense of challenge and reward with some fun risk on putting more features into a new game to give it a boost in sales. I highly recommend this to gamers, and for sure to those gamers that want to develop games as career because this puts you in the driver seat of your own company.
0786890932|4.0|The book gives some character details that there is never time for in a movie. I also enjoy the Irish way of speaking...
B00F91G5BS|2.0|Just plain boring.  It was more about military procedures than the trials of a family making it to safety. If you like that, then maybe this is for you.  Not much end of the world type scary stuff.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim is the only movie of 2013 thus far that has lived up to it's promise.  By far the best movie of the year.  Ultraviolet sucks though.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best ever made for TV horror series.  I think the first season was better, but this one is great too!
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Prog rock at its finest---tipuch of Spock's Beard and Flower Kings,but very professional and incredibly original. Best piece is the the 19 minute closer but don't skip anything to get to it!.
B000VZJUGY|5.0|This a great NIN cd! one of my favorites. Trent Reznor kicks it in this version.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock or metal.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Well, actually, the title of the review just about covers it. But I need more words to satisfy Amazon. Like.
B0070ZLZ1G|1.0|This book basically challenges the notion of that the &#34;cognitive hypothesis&#34; is a reliable indicator of success for children, and instead proposes that strength of character should be the focus for both parents and educators. This premise is stated somewhat bluntly in the first few pages of the book, and the rest of the text is a meandering, repetitive, disconnected set of observations of different educational and extra-curricular programs around the country.<br /><br />There was no compelling body of evidence presented (in the form of studies or really any quantifiable measure) that should convince the reader that education should fundamentally refocus from instruction of facts to development of character or aptitude. As a matter of fact, the Spiegel/chess instruction essay is excruciatingly detailed on the human triumph of chess mastery, only to conclude with the laughably depressing reality that the chess star at the center if the story was unable to pass a standardized aptitude test that would require him to know geometry or locate Africa on a map.<br /><br />I have a one year old daughter, and I am convinced that I am a sub-par parent because I don't read to her every night. When I do, it's often articles from popular mechanics because I hate the Hungry Caterpillar. I don't teach her the colors or the alphabet because I get bored with it faster than she does. I don't feel prepared to prepare her for success. So, then the kindle sample for this book offered the possibility that encouraging curiosity and supporting a persistence to learn might actually be more constructive than doing the hard work of flash cards or math drills, of course like any other lazy parent, I fell for it!<br /><br />Don't be a sucker like me. Load up on the Dr.Suesses and Eric freaking Carles.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not easy to xscape but fun it took me 5 days to win the game but I would do it over again.
B004ZJZPX4|5.0|Awesome cast,  I'm not into giving away the in's & out's of the movie.<br /><br />Cast  makes the movie & great script,  can't ask for much more.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00F30S0Y0|1.0|Did you ever buy a CD because you heard one song before it was released and loved it, only to find that the rest of the album is terrible?  That's my experience with Reflektor.  The title track is definitely one of the best songs of the year, but the rest is muddled, tepid and weak.  Disc one is filled with half-hearted electronica/disco tracks that never get off the ground.  Disc two is more mellow, but murky and meandering throughout.  Reflektor has been overhyped to the extreme.  I'm glad so many people love it, but I sure don't.
B0012Q732O|2.0|I enjoy cheesy movies which make no pretense of being historically accurate, but just set out to give the viewer a good time. However, the first requirement in such a movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously. In this movie, Roland Emmerich commits the cardinal sin of trying to make this a drama. As a result the movie simply hasn't enough fun to make up for the liberties he takes with history.<br /><br />The special effects are good, but the acting is non-existent and the story is so feeble as to hardly merit the name. I found it in the $5 bargain bin and still overpaid.
B0077DBZXO|5.0|When my grandson stays over, he picks a &#34;big bed & popcorn&#34; movie to watch before falling asleep.  I was happy when he pick Puss in Boots because I really do like this one!  I think for me it's the portrayal by the voice actors, where for him, it's the fairy tale aspect. Fun little movie for a 4 year old & Gramma!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|This book has not grabbed my interest enough to even get out of chapter one.  Wishing I hadn't wasted my money.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very addictive.  Once I have started to play it I can't put it down till the energy has run out.  Can't wait for extra levels to be added. Definitely worth playing.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This writer is actually making money from this. That's the worst part of my shame in reading the book...I wasted my time and money...I only read it through in order to find out what Christian's problem was, which turns out, was not worth it in the end. After repetitive sex (&#34;oh no, not boring unimaginative sex again!&#34;)...and the promotion and acceptance of female degradation. I had enough.<br />But the worst part was the writing.<br />I mean really?...&#34;Aaargh&#34;?!<br />I wanted to know what all the hooplah was about...well, I guess our teens are not learning about real literature these days. Because that's the best I can give it. A possible &#34;teen&#34; book. But I wouldn't wish it on them either, as I truly hope our future leaders are better than this.<br />And now they're talking about a movie. Does the I.Q. quotient dip any lower in america? Any self-respecting actor would be wise not to ruin their career for this story. Sleez, porn, degradation, simpering trash.<br />Absolutely not recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best $35 I ever spent on an entertainment device. It actually plays Netflix at a higher quality than any of the existing players I had, makes Youtube an awesome source of entertainment for everyone, makes Hulu worthwhile, and even plays HBO Go via a Chrome tab at better quality than plugging my Samsung Chromebook in directly via HDMI. I have no complaints.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun! I love the graphics and all the activities. Never gets boring! I love it.
B00B19DW0E|4.0|Classic dystopian fare that still holds up 30+ years after launch. Right up there with Halloween as one of John Carpenter's two best films.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|She is such a wonderful writer! The words just flow. I love how I can walk away from the book and not pick it up for a week and remember every detail of what I had read previously
B0042U94UQ|4.0|This is a great children's movie. It's cute and imaginative. And it's got great humor in it so the adults watching can enjoy it too.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King and have read everything he has written but have not been to excited over his last couple of books.  The last good read was Under the Dome.  Even his short book tying into the Dark Tower series &#60;my favorite&#62; was okay.  But Doctor Sleep shows Stephen still has some great writing left in him.  I wont give to much away but the way he dives back into the life of Danny Torrence and the father like son relationship.  We see Danny at his worst before he finally turns his life around for the better.  Thanks to his gift of the Shinning of course that soon turns his life back on to a frighting roller coaster ride.  The True Knot represent evil at its darkest core by giving us such real people to be afraid of.  Who would ever think RV people could be so devious and deliciously dark. Rose the Hat is one of the greatest villains King has written since Randal Flagg and she deserves to be feared for her dark view on all us rubes &#60;normal people&#62;. With the help of some friends and one of the most powerful Shiners Abra Stone, we get a page turner were you just don't want to put the book down. King Writes the Abra character with love and shows even more of a child growing up with special powers she and her family do not understand.  A good look at the shining experience from birth much more than we got in the first book.  King keeps our hearts beating fast until the final confrontation in the worst place for Danny ever.  The characters are well written and not overly explained to death &#60;as some times happens, we don't need a back story on everyone&#62;.  Danny's fight with alcoholism and his gift/curse are well represented and King really does return us to the characters we have missed so much over the years.  Even the True Knot evil as they are show how people need to stick together no matter what, in this case their own survival.  I would set aside a weekend to read this cause you will not want to put it down.  Thank you Mister King for this treasure.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I simply love this movie. It's one of Pixar's great creations. It's imaginative, fun, and appropriate for the entire family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive and as game progresses it gets more challenging. Great for kids and adults. Sweets with out all the calories.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Digitally, Marvel is amazing. This brings so many extraordinary actors together to create an epic story. It's great fun and I can't wait to see the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for the kindle fire HD. It's way much better,with the bigger screen. No glitches at all, all data from before was memorized, from Facebook. Great job guys.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I love this movie. It touched me very deeply. Besides for the amazing actors, it is based on a true story which is one of courage, hope, and of friendship in the most unlikely way. It's very dear to me.
B00881VLCE|5.0|No pieces falling from the table and no sore back and neck from bending forward all the time. Pure bliss!
B00AFEX83C|5.0|At first I didn't want to watch this movie because the topic of monsters didn't really speak to me. I never should have doubted Pixar. It is adorable and fills me with a cozy, warm feeling and is appropriate for all ages. Love it, love it, love it.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I think it was a really cool moviei liked for a movie because it was very funny .bwe all liked it in the family.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|This movie really did justice to Wolverine's character. It's imaginative and creative, even if it is sad. Anyone who is a fan of X-Men and/or Wolverine should watch this.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|THIS NEW Grisham is a great example if the author at his country best. I have always thought  \\"A Time to Kill\\" was one of his best, and I was glad to revisit Jake, Ford County and all the rest. However, I did miss Sandra Bulloch!
B005FPT51K|5.0|I have bought 4 different monitors before this one. One just went dead after a few months, one halfway died (lost visual but had sound), and the last two had the worst reception ever. I was worried about the wifi reaching through our house because we already have issues with signal strength. No problem with this monitor at all. Pic is clear, sound is great, no lost signal, and I couldnt be more happy. Sucks I wasted all that time and money on the other ones but now I can relax.... ahhhhhhh
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is the Master!  I couldn't put this book down and lost a lot of sleep!  Very creative and clever.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|haven't laughed as hard in years.<br />runs the gamet of emotions and it isn't<br />  even a great movie.<br />if you like laughing, this is the one.
B005XUC398|4.0|the strength of the characters keep this interesting, and the great actors keep it alive; i can't think of anyone who would willingly watch a movie about financial meltdown on wall street without the characters....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had heard about this game, and had been wanting to play it for while, but wanted to wait for something to come up.<br /><br />So when the  latest Kindle Tablet Version came out, I went, and took that  chance. I've only reached somewhere around level 20, and I've started to like it so much.<br /><br />I can't be too sure HOW good this is, but one try of this game, and you may end up liking it right from the get-go. I think this would be Bejeweled, but with candy treats. And that's good enough for me.<br /><br />5 stars even, and a 7 out  of 10 for the Candy Crush Saga game.<br /><br />Get your sweet tooth on. ;)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|a female lead in a world with not enough strong female leads; the silliness of some of the scenes takes some of the edge off the violence, and it leaves you setup for the sequel. enjoyable entertainment, not much more.
B009LDD54K|3.0|We did not feel that it was as good as the 1st and 2nd season.  We were not happy with Nukie's wife character development.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The book has likable characters and an interesting plot line.  Bored with his life, Harold takes off on a walk and discovers himself along the way.  Equally as interesting is the change in his relationship with his wife as he continues walking.  It's a fairly light read but stayed with me afterward.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. I have completed several of these FlipPix Art apps. 5&times;5 are great for young ones and the 15&times;15 and 20&times;20 are challenging but do-able for adults.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I just couldn't get into it, boring, I really like the fish tank one though!. Skip this one and you will be glad you did.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|IT MAKES YOU NOT WANT TO STOP READING ONCE YOU START!  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT, BEST BOOK SO FAR BY STEPHEN KING!
B009GEYX5E|4.0|Great for an  aunt of mine who showed me her 600 polaroid camera - an indicated she was sad she could not use it anymore, I sent it as a gift and my aunt was so excited!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is a challenge and fun at the same time.  its a fun way to kill time and challenging enough to want to keep going and defeating the next level. thank you Amazon!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Took a little bit of time to get into it - but once I did, it was incredible.  I totally recommend this book and even if you find it slow to begin with, keep reading!
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|i was always curious as to how jason would be to see live and what kind of music he would showcase as i was not very knowledgeable about him until recently.  without knowing his catalogue of songs, from the get go of this dvd, i was a fan. he knows how to weave the audience into his web and make them feel like they are the only one in the audience.  hes down to earth sophistication makes him even more likeable.  the show is obviously about how facny a production can be, but about the incredible and unpretentious music he write.  i loved this particular dvd from beginning to end and hoping that the newest tour, love is a four letter word will also be available to purchase in the coming months.  treat yourself to this one if your a avid fan or just a fan!
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Pacific rim is a conglomerate which marries together the classic Japanese monster films (think Godzilla) with a dash of something like Iron Man and Transformers thrown in for good measure. Just think if the creatures HP Lovecraft wrote about battled against gigantic robots and you have a good idea of what this movie is like. As an added plus,put guillermo del toro in charge of putting all these ideas together and what you have is a movie with an intriguing premise, and impressive visuals to boot.<br /><br />What I love about the robots (or Jagers as their called in the film) is that while their both huge and extreamley powerful,(Where told in one scene in particular a certain Jager has 50 diesel engines per square inch of muscle fiber) stomping through the eye's of hurricanes and towering over the biggest sky scrappers,they still have a great sense of vulnerability about them. None of these machines are invincible and seem to be just as flawed and vulnerable as the people who created them. For being able to convey both these ideas at once is very impressive if you ask me.<br />Pacific Rim cleverly weaves together all the extravaganza of a summer block buster while being able to also maintain interesting human characters that are more than just convenient plot points. Their execution is a step behind the effects but serviceable nonetheless.<br />The biggest downfall of Pacific Rim is probably the lack of  “del Toroism” in this film if that makes any since. His touch is certainly their but is less prevalent than in his other films and feels a bit buried underneath  all the cannon fodder.<br /><br />The 3D.<br />I have to say this film is a huge 3D achievement. From beginning to end your visuals are constantly treated to some of the best 3D to date,with the only downfall being a sparse scene here or their without 3D transfer. City landscapes,the cold barren Antarctic,military compounds,all look gorgeous in 3D and I felt like I was riding in a Jager myself the wholeway threw.<br /><br />In conclusion Pacific Rim is a great ride and worth every extra penny for the 3D. Some fan of del Toro may feel a bit disappointed his touch is a little less noticeable here,but I consider that a back handed compliment for what's otherwise a great film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some swearing, but soo good. I loved it. I craved reading this book! Fantastic job John Green! I'd recommend it to teens and young adults mainly.
B0009X4UW2|5.0|The tape works perfectly, and the casing is without any cracks. It's a wonderful thing to own, and the music has that perfect vintage sound. It's basically what I expected, and what I expected was a Joshua Tree tape that worked, and didn't have the songs from the Deluxe Edition. So, I'm happy. DanoutaDan
B003O86FMW|5.0|Must read the Mockingjay because the ending of Catching Fire is not enough. But overall I love the book! Definitely recommend it.
B001HN694K|5.0|The seller was fast in shipping and item was as described. I love this movie with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter.The visual effects are really great as are all the characters. A excellent remake of the Disney classic that everyone will love.
0380730405|4.0|I loved the movie and loved the book.  There were some things that I found a little frustrating but I'm sure this is because I love the movie version so much.  I found it to be very well written. Definitely left me slightly dissatisfied, wanting more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this games aight. i like it i think it can be a bit slow at times but its okay. there are other games out there that are better. but this is a good time waster.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Having never read any of her books, I enjoyed this book so much I promptly ordered more...suspensful and a great cast of characters
B005LAIH4A|3.0|My kids weren't thrilled after watching this movie but we got it for such a great deal that I don't regret the purchase. I thought the storyline was boring and slow in some places.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this show!! Watched both seasons in 3 days! I wish I was friends with Harvey and Mike! Funny, serious, and amazing!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Brandt Legg and I can tell you it won't be the last. I was very intrigued by his writing. I love books that keep me interested and looking forward to turning to the next page. This book did just that. The characters and story are extremely well put together and I was very impressed with Brandt Legg's writing. Highly recommended!
1451666179|5.0|Subject is not a typo or spelling error. Regular readers of Hyperbole and a half will understand.<br />I Laughed Till I Cried.<br /><br />The Binding seems a bit weak but the content is great.<br /><br />Thanks Allie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game to play to pass the time very addicting would definitely recommend. Very interactive you can connect to Facebook which i like.
1449305172|5.0|Ash summarizes all the right principles in this easy to understand and easy to follow book, Running Lean. Must read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|good game makes you think ....challenging and sometimes mind boggling . reviews were accurate glad that. we choose to. use this game
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Flawless direction and marvelous acting performances make this a classic. The rawness and honesty of the photography, script and story brings you in, as you are hypnotized by brutality, naivety, treason and the pursuit of the American dream.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Ordered this for some freinds to catch up on walking dead worked great. Love the waking dead it is the best.
B00821OX98|5.0|You have to suspend your disbelief, but it's a lot of fun to watch the action unfold. I really the characters and the sense of family and friendship that evolve. It's real wo being over the top cheesy.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I just saw this original \\"Carrie\\" after having seen it on TV decades ago. I decided to make it my traditional Halloween evening film. I was afraid that on the second time around, since I had such a vivid memory of the first viewing, that there would be longish dull stretches. But there were none! And that is REALLY important for a classic, where you can savor every single scene. I will tread lightly for those few who have not seen it once. The pace is incredibly tight. Not once are there a few minutes where the story lags. Of course, Sissy Spacek is absolutely the perfect actor to play Carrie, at the perfect age, but she could not carry the movie alone. Piper Laurie is a truly scary character. I would not stay in the same house with her for more than five minutes. When she visits a neighbor, I imagine that the neighbor's skin began to crawl after only a few seconds. And yet, the difference between her and a lot of mothers is probably not that great. She is just creepy enough to push one over the edge. Aside from Spacek, I suggest the actors who contribute the most to the film are those who play Carrie White's classmates, Amy Irving, William Katt, John Travolta, Nancy Allen, P. J. Soles, Michael Talbot, and Edie McClurg. Betty Buckley is believable as the gym teacher, but the teens steal scenes from her. This was Travolta's first important movie role, even before he was cast as Vinnie Barbarino on \\"Welcome Back, Kotter.\\" He is good, but Katt and the four girls are even better. And, for you who have not yet seen it, this film has one of the very best climaxes of any horror film I have ever seen. I think for that we must thank Stephen King, who, I believe, used the same ending in more than one of his other books.<br /><br />I happened to look up the careers of the actors I mentioned, and I believe a lot of credit has to be given to the casting director, since for virtually every actor, including Betty Buckley, this was one of their first film appearances.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Good game, but more of the same, can be a little predictable. Nice graphics, good sound. Great as a free game but not sure if worth the full price.
0802473156|5.0|A must read for anyone contemplating a meaningful relationship with the opposite sex, whether it be marriage or a companionship.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was absolutely and completely blown away by shear technical genius of the way this novel was constructed.  It is like an onion once you start peeling back the layers - there is more and more there, and there is an interconnectedness and intertwining that all comes together in the end (absolutely no spoilers here).  Much in the way that each Seinfeld episode wove a number of separate plots together seamlessly, Liane Moriarty manages to do the same, but on a much darker, deeper level.<br /><br />Somehow, though some of the characters are initially difficult to get to know, I found myself feel empathy, finally, for each and every one of them.  If you're looking for a great mystery, good character development and something to get your thoughts moving, this is it.  Only after I finished did I read about the inspiration for this story - I remember the original story and was deeply, deeply touched by the tragedy of it.... check it out WHEN YOU FINISH THE BOOK!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This movie was painfully slow and boring.  Waste of time and $.  A movie for women only. I guess if your GF or wife wants to watch it just enjoy the gorgeous 1929 Duesenberg Model J.  Which doesn't belong in a film taking place in 1922.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I completely, utterly and thoroughly enjoyed this read, even though I had heard about the spoiler and was DREADING it as part of the plot - in fact, when I heard about that, I started not to read it.  The jaunty, flighty Bridget is still there - only there are more layers to her along with more responsibility (two young children).  I am surprised by the number of negative reviews, but I recognize that even a fictional character is allowed to grow and change.  Her dating efforts, half-hearted attempted at a career and her wry, self-deprecating comments about herself all add up to a delicious dessert buffet for this reader!<br /><br />Sorry, all of you Bridgetistas who wanted a rehash of the other books.  Life changes, sometimes not for the better for all of us... even our beloved Bridget wasn't exempt from this!
0061906220|5.0|After a year and a half reading this book it has not grown old to an almost 6 year old or the parents reading it.  The book is engaging and has a certain giggle factor to it that is always amusing.  Having a child blurt out the answer to the questions in the book  always bring a smile to my face. The interwoven song is simple to pick up and really adds to the experience. It is also a go to gift for friends who are having birthday parties for their young kids.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I was completely swept up by this series.  Intense characters and the storyline is quite original.  I was surprised by the differences between the movie and the first book; they should have stuck a little more tightly to the storyline in the book - it definitely makes more sense.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Been using this product for about 2 months and it's one of the Best Android Apps I've bought.  It can improve your battery life by probably 1-13% if you use it's Boost feature every-time your phone or tablet is going to be in Stand-By mode for the night or a few hours.I recommend this product.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I wasn't sure how these would be for me, new actors and new storylines.  These movies are fabulous!  Go, J.J. Adams, Go!  Please keep revamping.  My only complaint... there's one scene toward the end of Into Darkness, based on a scene in the original that kind of made me giggle and roll my eyes.  Sorry, I don't think Spock would be so dramatic!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works right out of the box. And it's cheap! Great way to watch Netflix on an older t.v!<br />It repleaced a Wii for that purpose and the image quality is WAY better...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank you, Stephen King, for another fabulous addition to my library!  I love all of SK's books but there is something to be said for revisiting old friends.  Black House was  a great way to revisit Jack from the Talisman, and this book, Dr. Sleep is a great look at Danny Torrance from the Shining.  I always wonder what happens to the characters after the story ends, and this gives us a look back into Danny's life.  SK's character development is wonderful, his storytelling is captivating.  The only trouble is the wait between new books!
B00F880BWG|5.0|Skillful mix of character-driven storytelling and suspense/horror. Acting for the most part is stellar. Special effects are cutting-edge believable. I love watching this show, and usually watch each episode two to three times.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Chose this for family movie night and the kids loved it.  My oldest found it a bit scary at times, but nothing that kept him from watching.
B0091WQ58E|5.0|Always a fan of Sherlock Holmes and his author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle but this adds a bit of modern twist. The film keeps to the usual standards that we expect from Holmes but shows a bit more of his conflicted mind.  People forget that Holmes was also a drug user to keep his powerful mind from overloading, so the peculiarities shown in the film are actually somewhat believable.  I enjoy the scenery design, costumes and the more powerful role that Dr. Watson portrayed.  Even if it's not a true &#34;social commentary film&#34;, it is entertainment and that's usually why I watch movies.
B008Y212PI|4.0|very fun. a bit repetitive at times but fun overall. somthing to pass the time while waiting either at the doctors or in the school pick up line. great for kids on a road trip.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|A much different sound than most of the music I listen to but still drew me in somehow.  I can't really put my finger on why I like it as much as I do but it just works.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Exciting book, action packed and very well written. Keep up the great work, cause I am hooked now on the Jack Reacher series!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This movie was so great.  It told everything that I didn't know.  I still can't believe it but I will be watching it again and again.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I love it because it is action packed and very descriptive. I love the human side of it also, explaining the decisions and thoughts of the characters. A great read if you love this kind of book. Keep them coming Lee Child!
159562015X|5.0|Strengthsfinder is something everybody must do to become self-aware and create an action plan for tapping into their individual strengths. Its all made easy in this one book. Item came as described and in excellent packaging. I received the item on time as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is phenomenal and has arguably the best ending of any book (rivaling with the Harry potter series). In the middle some readers may find it slow, but it is all worth while when you read the last two chapters.
B00E0SX118|4.0|Its like an updated Flintstones. Graphics and story line were great. Mult level humor suiitable for all ages. Would recommend this movie for the entire family.
0763644765|4.0|I gave this book to a friend's daughter when she turned 2.  Now at over 3 years old and fully potty trained, she still loves this book and practices reading it quite often.  The pictures are fun and the story seems to remain interesting to young children long after it has been read several dozen times.<br /><br />The book has also held up to throwing, some water splashed from the tub and various other acts of toddler abuse.
B005HED08I|5.0|Awesome show, after watching this I realized why people still like it. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of good science fiction.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I am not a huge book reader and usually do not finish books.  But this book was so much fun and  brought back so many fun memories that I had a hard time putting it down.
B00000J2PH|4.0|Love Carole King and never got this &#34;album&#34;- it's good~ need to be in the mood to listen to it however- brings back memories. I'm 52yo now so I just got in on the tail end of her early years- but she's still a huge influence in ALL MUSIC. Love her!<br />Item was in good condition from Amazon also.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Colorful, active game. Making you want to continue to the next level to see how far you can go, before you use up your lives.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is easy to use and easy to win.  The ads are frequent, and you have to use your tablet's corner status to get to the SKIP option.
B00EBRWN80|2.0|I thought this was a good idea but was not able to access many of the tv channels because of my geographical location, which was a shame.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Had to download and attempt to install the app numerous times but it has finally loaded. Controls easy to understand and a overall fun game.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This app did a great job clean junk off my kindle.  Easy to follow. I have recommended. To my friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love to play candy crush I have almost become addicted to it lol, so to finally have it where we could get it on Kindle from Amazon was wonderful it is just as much fun and addicted on amazon as it is on Facebook.
159420411X|4.0|Nate Silver came into fame for his forecast of the presidential election in 2012. That matched his success in 2008 for also getting the presidential election correct. His book, The Signal and the Noise, is built upon that success.<br /><br />We learn that Silver is not a political pundit, but a numbers geek. He started with statistical analysis of baseball while toiling away for the accounting firm KPMG. The next step was online poker, using his analysis to be a better poker player. That made him a lot of money, for a while. Then he turned to political analysis where he caught broader attention.<br /><br />But the book is not a biography, or pages of Silver trumpeting his own horn. It's a book about the success and failures of using data to forecast future events. Silver slices the data into two categories. The Signal is the truth and the Noise it what distracts us from the truth. In today's market, information is not a scarce commodity. However, we perceive it selectively and subjectively. Our biggest failure is not paying attention to our own distortion. We never make perfectly objective predictions. They are always tainted by our subjective point of view.<br /><br />Silver looks at the statistical analysis used in several fields:<br /><br />  the housing bubble and mortgage securities crisis<br />  television political pundits<br />  baseball<br />  weather<br />  earthquakes<br />  economic forecasts<br />  flu epidemics<br />  poker<br /><br />Taken from a scientific perspective, predictions can be tested. Silver tests them.<br /><br />For example, look at weather forecasts. If the forecast calls for a 20% chance of rain, it should rain on 20% of the days that have that prediction. Silver backtests the performance of weather forecasters. He finds that some consistently over-forecast rain, raising a 5% chance to 20%. That way the audience will be less disappointed if it rains. Silver also compares long term forecasts to average conditions for that day. It turns out that the long term forecast is more likely to be wrong than merely relying on the historic average.<br /><br />But weather forecasting has improved. Hurricane prediction is an area that has seen measurable improvement. Over the past 25 years the hurricane landfall prediction for three days in advance has decreased from a 350 mile radius to a 100 mile radius.<br /><br />There is plenty in this book for compliance professionals. The first topic in The Signal and the Noise is the rating agencies and the financial crisis of 2008. He uses an example of S&P's rating of CDO tranches. In achieving the AAA rating, S&P predicted that there was only a 0.12% probability that it would fail to pay out in the next five years. The reality is that the failure was 28%. The actual default rate was more than 200 times higher than predicted.out that the long term forecast is more likely to be wrong than merely relying on the historic average.<br /><br />But weather forecasting has improved.

B009CF3MEK|3.0|purchased it to see the original making of it, I saw the one with Leonardo DiCaprio and I really liked it but had never seen original, I enjoyed the newest version best but this one was good too.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|This is what I was hoping for from the resurgent Testament.<br /><br />I got Testament Live in London and was frustrated with the camera editing. As is so often the case with music videos, the video editor in Live in London 1) did not know where to focus the camera during various parts of the song, such as the guitar solos, 2) the video editor in Live in London felt the need to change camera angles to the beat. This gets very distracting. The Dark Roots of Thrash video was obviously done by a fan who avoided both these pitfalls. The crowd is also very good, and the camera shots of the headbanging and the pit are good. (One suggestion, someone should do a helmet cam in the pit!) There are quick edits of camera angles, but I did not find them distracting - to get an example of the editing style of the video, check out the Rise Up! video on youtube. The first reviewer did not like the minor video slow motion and other effects - I can say they were kept to a minimum and I liked them - they were very lightly used and did not distract from the songs or the show. And note that I am very sensitive to bad video editing.<br /><br />For reference, you can check out Rise Up! on You Tube which is the first song off of this release. Some in the comments have criticized the mixing as \\"too polished\\" for Testament -- but actually, that is one of the main reasons that I did not get into Testament earlier - I always thought their mixing was too mid-rangy -- But their last two albums have been great, so I have been getting into their back catalogue. With this perspective in mind, I think the polish in the mix is a welcome thing - it allows you to enjoy the musicianship of this band. Now understand that this is concert flat out thrash --- so I am assuming you want your metal heavy and fast. The audio mix is excellent. I somewhat suspect studio overdubs, but I don't care because the sound quality is great - again better than Live in London. The only songs I wish they had included are Electric Crown and Souls of Black, (I also would have liked a live version of Cold Embrace) but other than that they really nail the song selection in the set list.<br /><br />Hoglan is amazing on the drums, and Skolnick kills it on every solo. Chuck Billy is a beast of a front man, and leads this thrash machine through the paces with a smile. Loved it.<br /><br />Testament shows that they are part of the Big Five of Thrash.
B0043X1FL8|4.0|purchased for my son. Why do you require so many words? This is so stupid. This is so stupid. This is so stupid.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome and challenging at the same time.  never bored with it. recommended to everyone.  wish it was available on widows 8 phones though.
B00000IQV7|4.0|purchased for my son. Why do you require so many words? This is so stupid. This is so stupid. This is so stupid.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn should consult an expert next time to avoid some glaring plot-flaws, however, if you're not a retired detective like myself), then those implausible details won't stand out to distract you from her skilled writing style. I found this read hard to put down, and Flynn gets points for keeping readers on the edge of their seats, waiting for the next shoe to drop.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|I lived the movie.  Had an interesting plot and some twists I didn't expect.  Great actors in the movie.  If you like Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise you will like this movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|I usually HATE movies that are based on books but they did a good job with this one.  Looking forward to the sequels.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I loved it, great StarTrek movie.  If you are a Treky you will love it.  Great special effects, great play off the original Khan episode, all around good StarTrek
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is another classic. Grisham has been the master forever. I was just settling in for a good read when the story twisted, turned and took off in an unexpected route leaving me surprised and puzzled. The conclusion peeked my sense of fairness. Grisham left me satisfied, something that can always be expected.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Surprise that Shane Black directed this,Maybe this is what the franchised need action and adventure. One of the best!! .
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I did not enjoy this book. In brief, I did not enjoy this book because by the end, it occurred to me that it was just a terribly long-winded list that could be entitled \\"Potentially Invasive Things that Nameless Tech Corporation Is Planning to Do to You\\". The subtitle would be \\"And a Stupid Girl Too!\\". Although this pretty much sums up my thoughts on the book, I'll attempt to be more specific without spoiling.<br /><br />The book is about \\"The Circle\\", a hybrid Microsoft/Google/Facebook/Amazon mega-company that wishes to insert itself into every part of people's lives. The central character is a selfish, myopic dimwit named Mae who gets sucked in by the shiny company campus and soon enough is sucked into the party line as well. Mae appears to be some kind of robot who is very good at taking orders and not so good at actual thinking. I'd call her one-dimensional but that would be an insult to the first dimension. The \\"plot\\", such as it is, involves Mae's descent into the Cult of the Circle while the Circle reaches its tentacles out in an attempt at Total! World! Domination! [insert maniacal cackle here]. By the end, I was hoping that Mae would be eaten and crapped out by a shark.<br /><br />The whole thing is just ridiculous. It's not ridiculous enough to cross into campy fun, or sharp enough to cross into satire. It's just a massive thought dump with no character development and no real plot. Don't waste your coin on this one.
B0057F869U|5.0|I Highly recommend this movie. Mia and Michael have great chemistry and give solid performances. Very much like the book.
1742204147|5.0|I have always wanted to visit Japan, and it doesn't look like I will make it there anytime soon. Nevertheless, with the help of the lonely planet guidebook to Japan, and Google Earth, I am on my way. Let's say you want to check out Hokusai, one of Japan's best known Artists. Bam! The lonely planet guidebook to Japan got your back. There is a Hokusai Museum in Obuse, a lovely little town northeast of Nagano. Hokusai did a lot of his work there, and over 30 of his works are on display. His most famous work, The Great Wave off Kanagawa, might not be there, as it was last seen in 2012 at The British Museum, but with the help of the guidebook, you can find the prefecture of Kanagawa, along with the other 35 views of Mt Fuji, the series from whence it came.<br /><br />Maybe you are more concerned with more recent Art, such as Anime, or Japanese Animation. You might want to check out the Ghibli (pronounced \\"Jiburi\\") Museum, home to Ghibli Studios and designed by master animator Hayao Miyazaki himself. Even if you are unfamiliar with Spirited Away or their other films, you will love the fairy tale atmosphere and the climbable Cat Bus.<br /><br />One of my favorite books from the Japanese is 1968 Noble Prize in Literature Winner Yasunari Kawabata's Snow Country. If I were to indulge my whim of visiting Northern Japan, and other sights important to Japanese Authors such as Yukio Mishima, Junichiro Tanizaki, Soseki Natsume, and Ryunosuke Atkutagawa, this guidebook would be indispensable. The same could be said of my long cherished dream of exploring sites from the films of Akira Kurosawa or Nagisa Oshima.<br /><br />For those of a spiritual bent, there are ancient Buddhist and Shinto Temples, and the old capitol, Kyoto; or for the die hard live-for-the-momentsters, sake bars, discos, the sprawling metropolis Tokyo, and the Sapporo Beer Festival.<br /><br />More than just a list of sights and locations to visit, there is also lots of helpful information for the traveler. There is a Survival Guide, and help navigating the complex waters of Japanese Etiquette. There is a primer of basic spoken Japanese, and even tips on what sorts of electric sockets you might encounter. There is a lot of invaluable information to the traveler packed into its 880 pages, as well as a pull out map and links to further online resources. Chris Rowthorn was the Coordinating Author, and his team of Andrew Bender, Laura Crawford, and Trent Holden do an excellent job of holding down the fort.is a Survival Guide, and help navigating the complex waters of Japanese Etiquette.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It really gets you in its grip, it seems to take you over and you just do not want to let it beat you.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|One of the best movies of this year. Id want my whole family to see this movie, its great for all to see
B004EF65QA|5.0|Excellent production! I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Mr Thornton is almost equal to Mr Darcy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think we should be aloud to download minecraft for anybody who wants to play minecraft like me I want to play minevraft
B000ZN8036|5.0|Excelente
0880796863|5.0|This is the deck I learned Tarot on and have never felt comfortable with the other decks. I purchased this to replace the deck I had that disappeared in a recent move. Received it quickly and was exactly as expected. Very happy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A really good read, very well written. Not exactly what I expected, and, from what I've heard, very different from the movie, but keep you wanting to turn the next page.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|While this novel has a number of elements to it, Ms. Moriarty deftly pulls them together in the end.  The story is both intriguing and thought provoking----what would YOU do?!
B008Q00PHY|4.0|Travolta carries the film but overall it was a good movie. If you like shoot em ups - this is one for you.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Nice easy read was not looking for a book of education just a fun read and this book was great for that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. 're-read this just in time for movie release. You must read this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great time suck, relaxing music. I assumed doing a puzzle in the computer wouldn't be as good as the real thing, but I was wrong
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|From the first scene of season 1, episode 1, I was hooked.  The cast is the best they could have assembled.  Watching Vic, and his team crumble, and the fallout from the rest of the department was some of the best writing, I've ever seen.  A very strong and tightly written show.  I would give 10 stars if I could.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is an excellent book as it engages you completely. I could not put it down and I did not want it to end. I did wonder about some of Meredith's  motives and would like to know if she was jaded by her work or if she loved Victoria. What happened to Grant 's father?  What's next for Victoria, Grant, Catherine, and baby Hazel? Does Bloom survive?  This is a book deserving of a sequel.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|The moment I noticed that they have space flight but can't even construct a proper seat for a 7 hour space flight, I knew this was going to be weird. Why do they construct their space ships from chicken carcasses, toilet paper and dinosaur bones. Was I actually watching the Flintstones? Why does a smart suit turn black in a green forest when danger approaches then later in patch of clover, turn white? Why won't it camo-up? Not smart. Having big bird come in and save the day when temperature dropped was to Narnia and too convenient. Why did the general send out the drones to look for the Ursa *after* he already sent his only child out on a suicide quest?<br /><br />I am a fan of this Smiths and I think Will Smith is a great guy and a great actor so I expect better stuff to come in the future. By the time I got to the end of the film I realized why this film was a stinker like The Last Air Bender - it's another M. Night Shyamalan movie, from which we expect too much. I blame him for making that kid run around like he's looking for a bathroom throughout the flick. I bet those two never work together again. If they do, I think most of us will pass. I know I will.
0393316041|5.0|What a fantastic book thus far! A very interesting man and a phenomenal story. Book was a little warped, overall a good product.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting.  Love sending and receiving lives with my family and friends.  My parents are in their 70's and are hooked on it.
1451666179|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Hyperbole and a Half blog, and I've been waiting and waiting for the book to come out.  It arrived today and I told myself I would read it slowly, stretching it out for a while, but instead I devoured it.  I'm so glad I got this book--it has some of my favorite comics from the blog, plus many new ones that made me laugh out loud--and I look forward to rereading it many times in the future.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This series keeps moving forward at a good pace, and this book keeps you glued to the pages all the way through.  The new characters introduced in this book are well rounded and interesting.  Cassandra Clare does a great job keeping the story line interesting; I was not disappointed with this installment of the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this game is great because....we'll who cares its awesome!!!who ever thinks this game isn't has lost their mind!!!
B008RYWN06|1.0|What else needs to be said? Worthless remaster that makes a mockery of a classic LP. Avoid this digital vinyl.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My daughter ADORES this movie.  She's five, and I feel comfortable letting her watch it without having to worry about content.  We saw it for the first time on Disney Channel and watched it pretty much every time it came on for the next month.  I was going to wait and buy it for her for Christmas, but she couldn't seem to wait that long, so I bought it as a suprise for her. It reminds me of the Disney Channel movies from when I was a kid.  Worth every penny!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved seeing what Danny did with his life! Great story kept me intreged and involved. King really gave new life to the original.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|This movie was good.  I had to restart it a couple of times, being distracted by other things.  But once I sat down to watch it, I thought it was very good.  I'm not much a fan of sequels, as they always seem to disappoint, but this was solid.
B0000640VO|3.0|I want to give this movie 5 stars, I really love it. Sadly the DVD I ordered while it was less expensive was also missing about 8 minutes of the movie. Such a great story, how Amelie lives her quiet life and how it changes dramatically in days
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Having grandchildren presents a great opportunity for watching a host of animations and dramas geared to young children.  Some are very engrossing.  This, not so much.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Awesome book. If you read &#34;a Time To Kill&#34; and enjoyed it, you will be doing yourself a favor by reading this one.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved this movie; it's exactly the kind you can watch again and again. I tried buying it used for cheap at stores in town, but never managed. I was trying to purchase a few new movies for my hospital bag (I'm expecting!) and was excited to find this as cheap as I did. The case it came in wasn't a normal plastic one, but I normally throw them away so I can conveniently store them in a large CD wallet to conserve space.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Just GREAT!  What a great &#34;Sargent Pepper&#34; for this band!  The recording sounds wonderful, mixing in the studio to perfection.  Thanks guys!  I just wonder how those French Montreal folks like this English singing band?  They are certainly still fresh, exploring, and fun.  I just LOVE this!  I am almost 68, they are keeping up with me!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|This album is awesome! True it is not another Teenage Dream, but artists need to evolve. Also comparing Prism to Teenage Dream is like comparing Teenage Dream to One of the Boys.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|Of course, my son HAD to complete the main character set of Chuggington with Koko!  Her quality is as phenomenal as all the other Chuggington chuggers!  There are no stickers, the wheels are firmly attached, and the magnets wont come off!  I definitely recommend this set to anyone!
B008BC24RQ|5.0|Perfect. The Gone With The Wind of Dracula movies. Sunday afternoon on a rainy Fall day, make the popcorn moive.
B004HHKFIY|5.0|The quality of this chugger is phenomenal!  I was really worried that there would be stickers for my son to pull off.  To my surprise, there were no stickers at all, it's all in the plastic!  The magnets work great and I'm finding that it's compatable with most of our track!  The only difficulty we have is going under low bridges that are not from the Chuggington set.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This series is wonderful. The mystery is great, I just couldn't put it down. There is quite a bit of extreme violence in this book so it's not for the faint of heart!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My son enjoys playing with these animals on legos and his wooden train table too!  I enjoy how versitile the little people and creatures are!  They are well built!  I was concerned that the word &#34;zoo&#34; on the lady would be a sticker but it's not.  There's no assembly needed either so remove from the packaging and play~!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was an interesting read and it's obvious that Eben experienced something, but his argument for it being a proof of heaven was not convincing to me or anyone else in my book club. Essentially everyone found it an interesting read, but did not find it changing their views of heaven, religion, or the afterlife from what they were before reading the book.
B004QSYSZ0|5.0|My son absolutely loves Chuggington!  We ran into a problem though because he wanted a place for his \\"chuggers\\" to sleep.  So we purchased the Chuggington Round House!  Mind you, he's only 2 1/2 years old but he can work the round about with ease!  I would recommend this product to anyone!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is an excellent album. It is prolific and catchy. I especially love Neon Cathedral and Same Love - absolutely amazing!
B004Q0SQ24|5.0|My son LOVES Chuggington!  And I enjoy the safety factors of Chuggington toys!  There are no stickers and no easily-removable parts!  The magnets work great and wont come off.  The wheels are very secure and work really well!  My only complaint is the height of the chuggers.  If you've got a lot of bridges from other sets, it may be difficult to push one of these chuggers underneath.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great mystery, that I could not put down. Lots of twists and turns. This is Gillian Flynn's best book as far as I'm concerned.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy how fun this game is. it makes you think and I like the puzzles. nice challenges as well.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Not going to &#34;spoil&#34; it for the readers and say don't read it.  You may have another opinion.  I will simply say don't rush to buy it.  It's not worth it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I figured I should read this book because everyone was creating such a buzz about it. It was a good book for those who like romance novels but nothing overly spectacular like many people have made it out to be. It's not something I'd rush to read again but was good if you like romance novels.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.Second half really picks<br />up,so don't give up.Was hoping the story wouldn't<br />head to South America,but it did.I don't understand the fascination with that for Grisham.<br />Most books of his with the South American twist(a lot of them),start to bore me quickly,<br />but this didn't go there until later in book,and didn't have me picturing a darn map in my head.<br />Played well with the story.Much better book than his last several.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Similarly as I posted about the first book, It was a god read but I didn't find it to be overly spectacular like many made it out to be. Good book to read if you Iike romance novels but nothing to rush out for.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|A fun movie that our whole family enjoyed. It is great for the child's imagination. It held the attention of my 2 1/2 year old.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Similarly as I posted about the first bad second  book, It was a god read but I didn't find it to be overly spectacular like many made it out to be. Good book to read if you Iike romance novels but nothing to rush out for.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Has been a great tool. Had no real problems all the years I had the mail system. Yahoo mail has easy to understand system and wonderful customer support.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loved it. It's easy to use and super convenient. We also bought one for his grandpa and that required a little explaining since he wasn't used to these kind of things. So we downloaded the app for him and he's got the hang of it already. Great product!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Good read expands on the first book very well.  And much like the first book you are drawn into the story as the charictors develope
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Super good I'm 14 and love using it for homeschool<br />Its a great app for anyone. I say get it its free so no money  needed.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book.  Story flowed very well and kept you interested as it drew you into the story further and further with every chapter
B0082RHRHC|5.0|No other book keeps me wanting to read and 're-read until eternity. It just confirms my faith in God.<br />Uhh
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Great series! TNG is still my favorite, but we enjoyed watching this series again from start to finish. We see something we missed with each viewing.
044042321X|5.0|Awesome experience!! Even though the story was already perfect, the illustrations and dialogues between the character, backgrounds and the designs gave this novel an excellent sensation to the reader.. I would say a must have for the Game of Thrones fans!!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Another spin on the overworked zombie genre. If you loved the book you will be unimpressed, if you havent by all means watch.<br /><br />Action is good, pace is fast, graphics are great.
B008220C92|5.0|The DVD was sent promptly and unopened. No scrapes on the package or any sign of tampering. La de da
B004LFO0ME|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />An excellent music selection! I have always been a big fan! I can't wait to place my next order!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Yvonne
B00EZPCZ5O|3.0|I've always been a fan of AFI and the audio fidelity on their albums has always been top notch. I will also say that even if I didn't particularly like any of their previous albums at first listen, they grew on me proving that AFI knew something that I didn't before they released an album. The songs on Burials are agreeable to me, but the audio quality is laughable and I'm suprised I seem to be the only one saying so. It literally sounds like it's streaming on Youtube or FM radio. Almost as if the last guy in line forgot to hold a button when bouncing the songs down or something. I thought it might be something to do with the fact that i have the \\"Best Buy Version\\" (as it was impoted into iTunes), but listening to the stream of the iTunes version (I know, streaming again, but iTunes has a very true to CD stream in terms of audio quality) it appears to be the same. The drums sound weird as hell and clippy too. And there is a TON of reverb going on. It sounds like something i would record in my basement. So my assessment is the songs are good but they SOUND like crap. That might not be a big deal to some people, but it bothers the hell out of me.
B008HTQ28K|1.0|So boring I thought it was written by someone else. Totally predictable and definitely not a thriller. A total waste of money
B00821OX98|5.0|I liked this TV series very much. The story is well constructed, and the casting is great. Enjoy a quite different niche this Alien invasion story is about.
0735619670|5.0|Phenomenal book  has help me tremendously in my career as software engineer.<br /><br />it steps you through build great software whether you are a C#, C++, JAVA, Python...etc developer this is a must have for all developers and software engineers alike
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome game easy to play with great levels wish there were more moves in some levels but over all not bad
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Very exciting movie.  Story is unbelievable but the action and acting is great.  Not gory but still nicely scary.  Loved it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|this is a must see.  Yes some parts of the singing are VERY bad, but hey not every actor is meant to play a part and some casting directors forget to check small things like singing ability.  But if you are a Les Miserables fan, then this will hold you over between showings of the traveling company in your city and others close to you.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I was disappointed when the series ended.  I really enjoyed watching the first season.  I'm looking forward to the new ones.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|I'll definitely read the rest of the series at some point.I like the mix of old and new. Love mixing of the cultures.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I was poised to LOVE this book, but I didn't. I enjoyed it, but it did not blow my mind like it has to others. I did really like the characters, but something just felt off to me.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|This show just gets better and better!! I'm so excited about Silas being in the picture this season and with all the plot twists with Katherine being human.
0812550757|5.0|For me, this is 180 degrees from Ender's Game. And it works for me. The story works here. The writing is better. I don't think we were as deep into Ender's head-space this time through. I think we should have been a little deeper in there, but it works well as is.<br />So, we're a couple millennia on from the events in the first book. A scientist dies, and his &#34;adopted&#34; daughter calls for the Speaker for the Dead. Along the way, she changes her mind, but in the process her own husband dies and one of her children calls for a Speaker. Add to that the pequeninos, the 'Piggies.' One of the more interesting alien races. I think they as an alien race work better than any other would have.<br />This is definitely worth the read. I think the interplay between The Church and The Speaker works well also as conflict. Yes, there is a small pinch of religion in here. It works without being too overbearing.<br />This is a great book that will have you thinking on some level about what is the &#34;right&#34; thing to do.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever, one of the few I would actually re-read many times. Great book.
0316322407|4.0|As I started this book, I couldn't help but wonder if a teenager's account of her life would be more than than just a rehashing of her horrible attack by the Taliban.  Fortunately, this book does offer a lot more about herself, her family, as well as her war-torn country's life which I found very interesting and learned a lot about the fragile conflicts in Pakistan over the last decade.<br /><br />My only qualm is that Malala doesn't always speak in this book.  The story is hers, mostly, but you can tell that someone else is speaking too, and that person is Christina Lamb.  Although the book is written wonderfully, it is easy to hear Lamb's voice as you read.  For example, the word \\"hospital\\" is used many times throughout the book, but, each time it is used, it is not preceded with a definite or indefinite article which is the same way people in Britain use the word; after I read the book, I saw that the blurb about Lamb said she lives in London.  Also the book gives very detailed accounts that happened when Malala was obviously in a coma or, at times, thousands of miles away from such events.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and would recommend it for people to learn about this brave girl's life as well as the problems that still persist in Pakistan.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because Christina Lamb, the ghost writer in this book, speaks a little too loudly and slightly grabs the story away from Malala Yousafzai.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I enjoy playing the game. got my wife to start playing and we spend the evenings playing. we loose track of time alot
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|I had to force myself to keep watching this at the beginning. If I hadn't paid for it I would have probably turned it off. Having lost my spouse it was a little hard to bear.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is fun and relaxing. Enjoy playing it on my rest time. Being a senior citizen + it is a good exercise for the mind
B00005V9IL|5.0|Loved it when I say it in the theater. Still love it on DVD.<br />As a SCUBA diver, anything underwater is great.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's addicting.. A great game... Once you get into Candy Crush, it is hard to put down. Nice touch with the time outs.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Well researched, with real-life examples gathered from an ex-FBI agent, this book explains non-verbal behaviour from the perspective of what happens in the limbic brain at the time each pattern is displayed.<br />After reading this you will not only better observe other peoples' body language but also pay more attention to your own. As I begun to make the connection between how I feel and the non-verbal behaviour I display, my life has changed in a major way.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|When I bought my kindle fire I was looking for a fun game of bingo. This is definitely fun. I am hooked to playing everyday
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just didn't want to put it down.<br />Very good romance.<br />Any woman or man that wants to spice up love life!!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is the best weather app that I have found for kindle Fire. It has a lot of features and does not take much time to load.
0786956291|5.0|If you have always enjoyed rpgs this is the one product you must purchase IMMEDIATELY. Unfortunately if there are less than three people the game becomes dull and will make you feel like you wasted money on it. ONLY purchase this item if you have a group of commited players, or head over to the offical dungeons and dragons website and search for a group of players!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I love deer hunting, thought this game would be fun. However, I'd rather spend my money on real hunting not play hunting.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great way to pass the time. Although with some of the new updates, there has been a lot of glitches.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a lover of great characters, so I was concerned when the first few apparent main characters got killed off at the beginning of the book, but then things really took off.  If you indulge teh first chapter or so, which sets the stage, you will be rewarded to a very interesting story.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Love this show and how well the producers integrate so much excellent drama in a 45 minute program. Great entertainment.
006202406X|2.0|The writer to me wrote the book just to write it... there is no actual soty here. She makes the characters go through so much for nothing and in such a moring and repetitive way. Death of a heroin can be ok, but the way she did it was so shameful. To me it was her trying to fill in some ideas.... and the fillers where just disastrous. The ending is not just sad, which is ok cause not every book has to have a happy ending, byt COME ON... make it mean something... dont just kill her cause it will be a surprise to the readers... make it mean something. And btw the constant exchange with Tobias and Tris well it was messy and not well done. I was so disappointed. I finished it because my colleague was reading it too but if it wasnt for her I think I would have just let is sit for a while.
0307341550|5.0|Another great book!  I literally couldn't stop reading it and was disappointed when it came to an end.  Luckily, I just bought her newest book :-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good but not the best of the three.  I'm looking forward to the movie.  I didn't expect the twist or the person Katniss ended up with. Overall it was an enjoyable read!
B00G32QIEG|3.0|2013-10-30
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a book to intrigue you and then make you consider so many life possibilities IF you only knew the secrets! But do we want to know the secrets?
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This has many options for ship building and my 9 and 11 year old kids love the game.  They are having fun dealing the the different physics of the game.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The ending could have been better and it was kind of confusing but it was still a great book with lots of details.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this series even more than the Catching Fire series.  The ending gave closure to the series most don't have that closure.  I think that both my kids would enjoy these books.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|Very pleased. I use the one card draw to get ready for my day!<br />Try! Offers a calm perspective and support.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this series that gives a glimpse into what life was like for the British elite and their support staffs back in the early 1900's. It's interesting to see the roles of the butler, valet's, footmen, maids and cooks. They seem to spend every waking moment hard at work supporting the Lord of the house and his family. There are a lot of sad events in this series which tends to be a downer but overall it is an excellent series. Can't wait for season 4!
B00B769XB8|5.0|Do I really have to say more? My husband and I loved this movie. What a great take on classic Hansel and Gretel. Plus Jeremy Renner...grrrrrowww.
B009H7SCMA|4.0|Before I read this book, I didn’t know that books can be written this way. I am reluctant to call it erotica, which typically contains little character development. The characters in this book are far from perfect, but I cared about them. I wanted them to succeed, to get what they want and defeat their opponents. Above all, I wanted them to be able to change their lives, their predetermined destinies for the classes they belong to. Despite a seemingly happy ending, however, what we learn is they can’t.<br /><br />The tension, jointly created by sports and love affairs, is skillfully maintained throughout the book. I also like a lot of the descriptions in which words are accurately chosen. I was somehow disturbed by the frequent changes of point-of-view, though, especially during the first quarter of the book. There are advantages of knowing exactly what everybody is thinking; on the other hand, sexual play is at its best when the situation is ambiguous. And for a “chinless wonder” like Algy, there is no need to go inside his head to know what he’s thinking. The actions are enough.<br /><br />Overall, there is a lot of drama in the book, which isn’t likely to happen in real life. But there were moments when I saw the clamor fading away, and the dark, cold reality behind. There is nothing wrong with being naked in public; it is only wrong when people aren’t given a fair chance to prove themselves. For anybody who thinks there is no literary value in erotic stories, I suggest that they read this book.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I definitively enjoyed the first film more then this, but I still liked this one. If I had to say what let me down (without spoiling it for anyone) I expected more from the Kahn character and felt like they should have placed more emphasis on him, especially considering how important a villain he was to this series in the past.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I can't resist at least one game a day. It is always a challenge and and a brief diversion. Who doesn't love candy?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|this book is so well written. I finished it in a few days and the author really keeps the reader engaged through out the whole thing. it would mAke a great movie.
B00G32TD98|5.0|I just love these types of movies ,anything that involves possession and this movie did not disappoint , best horror movie in sometime now.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The end of the story came too soon. I had to start the next book almost immediately. I most enjoyable read.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|JJ Abrams delivers again.  If you liked his first Star Trek reboot you'll like this.  There is plenty of action and the story keeps you entertained.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Shipped quickly, and works like advertised, no problems. The keys are a little smaller than I thought they would be but overall I am satisfied with this transaction.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun app to play. Once you start it is hard to quit always a challenge  to play. Never a dull moment. If you like to play games and have fun this is the app for you.not to mention that they are cute.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Our kid loves them, we have the giraffe as well. It stays in his mouth and he rubs the feet and that calms him down as well.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|Fine way to honor Adam Brown and his family. I was left feeling that he was a very special person to have been able to overcome the adversities that got in his way
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game was great and fine to play and I had a lot of fun with it for awhile. I would even buy gold in the game and would only use it for speeding up certain processes but not really to buy more expensive dragon eggs. So, here is a WARNING for you to save any gold absolutely do Not click on any dragon in the store if you have #1 any gold in the amount of the dragon you just want to look at and #2 have an open nest. In my opinion these guys happily stole my money because of a glitch they aren't willing to consider.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game that anyone can play. It's impossible to predict just how the candies will land because they rearrange with each move so it's fun to see how many match up as they fill the screen after each play and you get multiple matches and scores
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I gave only 4 stars cause since an update a couple months ago it really hasn't been using my words and adding them to the library esp using bad words.  But i only use swipe function.  Love swipe so glad Swift key got it
B009V3KKXY|4.0|I do like the author, the book, the illustrations are great, the elaboration of the knots is perfectly detailed…<br />but I have to admit that I was looking for more &#34;sea-kind&#34; knots, such as bell ropes, fenders, handles for sea-chests.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|The story takes shape in a strange old bookstore from the point of view of the new clerk, who quickly realizes there's more going on than what's apparent on the surface. The underlying mystery and the intersection of technology in their search provides for a refreshingly different, and wholly entertaining, read that will fly by.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like the game. Haven't spent anything on it just play till my energy runs out.  I must say that I don't like the notifications it sends out once your rewards are ready for pick up! Even if my kindle fire is turned down you can still hear it. Can be annoying in the late hours.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This game is incredibly addictive. Very simple and very complex at the same time. Lots of cool missions and a sandbox mode as well. Definitely worth every penny.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|This is the best haunted Movie I have seen in a LONG TIME!!! Wow is all I can say!!! If you liked&#34; Rose Red&#34; you will LOVE this one!!!!!!<br />If you never seen&#34; Rose Red&#34; ,well watch it,,&#34;The Conjuring is WAY better!! But remember&#34; Rose Red&#34; Was Great!!!
B00F91H666|2.0|The movie was OK, especially the minor special effects,  but lacked any real story. You don't know what actually happened (so quickly) to cause the disaster...and you don't grow to know the characters or even care about them. And too much time is spent during the last predictable &#34;resolution&#34; which was supposed to be suspenseful. I understand there's a book which I don't know anything about...but to put it another way, my girlfriend usually can't watch good horror/scary films, but this one (which she was interested int due to Brad's appearance), made her actually laugh during the scary scenes...was left hoping for more.
055357342X|5.0|This comment applies to all the books in this series. In each chapter, Georg R.R. Martin tells the story from a certain character's perspective, and there are so many characters in his list. The more I read, the more I was amazed by his ability to understand a mind of different people in order to tell the story from that mind. One chapter he is a noble lord, then another a 9-year-old boy, then a warrior's mother, then a dreamy teenage girl. In some chapter we see things from the 'bad guy's view, or a hotheaded knight, or an exile queen.<br />Most of the authors I have read will have a specific set of characteristics and attitudes of the main character that is the signature of him/her, which is more or less the characteristics and attitudes of the auther him/herself. But when Martin delivers this novel in such a way, I was in awe. How can one possibly understand so many different minds? That is brilliant.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Makes you think and surprise ending. Don't think I will see movie, afraid it will ruin book.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE MOVIE BUT I'M DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH YOUR BOOK. I FOUND MYSELF FALLING IN LOVE WITH HOWL ALONG WITH SOPHIE. I ALSO LOVE THE IDEA OF SOPHIE HAVING HER OWN POWERS.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Another home run for this author. Heartbreaking, yet a page turner until the end. The characters heartfelt emotions are so deeply felt by the reader you'll remember them for many splendid suns to come.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|hooked on this game!!  wish I didn't have to wait so long before games though  it takes forever for 20 minutes to pass!!
B00DWFQ2TI|5.0|i dont have the clean cut version, but i will say this is a great album. lot of great songs, cabaret, murder, drink you away and not a bad thing, you got it on are my favorites. true blood has a spook dark feel to it but i like it, very seasonal! great job JT!
B008Q0AP2E|4.0|Love the film. Still holds up. Great cast and beautiful sets, and photography.  Read the books.  You won't be disappointed.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Maybe just some of the surprise wasn't there that was in the first round.  The whole scaling Caesars Palace with bed sheets was a little hokey as I expected most of the movie to at least be in the realm of reality - things that could/would actually happen.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Exciting plot twists and interesting story development.  I couldn't put this book down and every chapter made me rethink my perceptions of the characters.  Keeps you guessing until the end.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Avengers is the best movie ever. Enough said. I would highly suggest sitting down and watching this repeatedly without getting up
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I got Planet Earth for my partner for his birthday a few years ago, and we still enjoy watching it frequently. The coverage of different climates and plant/animal life is fascinating and stunning. The behind-the-scenes clips about how the folks involved got their footage and other experiences while reporting are great too! A must-watch for anyone with an interest in nature and wildlife around the world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I could play this all day, but I have other things I have to get done.  Fun game and interesting plus a little bit frustrating. Am I going to \\"buy\\" other levels to keep  playing..... no.  I'll play what I can and when I get tired of playing the same levels I will delete it.  I would rather play bejeweled 3.  But this is real close to it.  Thanks.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|This was a very well done movie on the origins of the X-men and what formed many of theirs and the villains back story. I enjoyed most of it save for a boring at times story. The actors were all great and really seemed to inhibit there parts.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Just downloaded this app today and it is a very fun game.  You won't be disappointed if you like the hidden picture games.  Except for having to wait for your rewards I still rate this game a five star game.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|Was is bad ? no not really but was it good no, not really. Normally I'd watch something like this again but this wasn't that kind of movie. It was average and not as god as the first.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Hated it, loved it, all at the same time. Broke my heart ,horrible ending :( will make you cry. This is no way to end a series
B001IF277K|4.0|It did its job to power a backup phone for a few days while I replaced another. NO heavy usage so hard to say much beyond that
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|There was an air of mystery from the beginning and I<br />enjoyed the writing style, kept my interest in all the characters to the finish
B000T433CO|4.0|This was a great movie that was not ruined by Cameron Diaz and that's a great things. Enjoyed the plot if not a bit unbelievable and seeing Eli Wallach still acting at a high level was awesome. This is a staple for us during the holidays.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan for decades. I've read them all. I enjoyed the follow-up on our little man from The Shining very much.  As expected, he is not without his flaws, but raises to the occasion when confronted with evil. Excellent character development and story line. I would recommend this book!
B001AQO3XS|4.0|Great movie for what it was. Its corny, over the top, and downright ridiculous...yet good fun. Was nice to see it in Bluray and watch it with the kid. Still not quite sure what he though of it.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Strap on fuels tanks, engines, command pods, parachutes and more and then shoot for the planet of your choice. You'll probably die a firery death, or overshoot ,run out of fuel and then drift endlessly though the void, but luckily dying is fun too.<br /><br />This is an awesome little physics and space game. Well worth the money.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Not as good as Taken and this although not a ripoff of it, it has the same actor so invariably you mind will compare the two.
B000026F4H|5.0|Besides a list of joyful, high quality guitar pieces, performed with personal warmth and intimacy, the last track, &#34;It's been something seeing you again,&#34;  transcends the world with the meaning of its lyric.  /Rue Cromwell
B003YOZNBU|2.0|This was quite terrible and you could tell whenever it came out it was quite the afterthought. Great idea but the execution wasn't there
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Based on reviews I read I expected something more in the way of plot.  It just kind of chugged along, like the Mississippi itself, leading to an uneventful conclusion.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Just a bit behind Santa Claus the movie for me (not the tim allen one). This was a great movie that we always watch on the holidays
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|If you thought you were safe, think again. This is a an unbelievable account of our nations nuclear weapons policy of over past few decades.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|This was something I got on a lightning deal as a stocking stuffer. I didn't expect much but after a few days this was in regular rotation. A nice cross between alternative and rock, with a hint of the The Boss inspiriation.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Great book to regain your health those that are suffering from many ailments related to the way you eat and how it affects not only your health but your brain too
B003ZDZ1WG|2.0|Yes there were the hits but that would be about it. The filler wasn't enough to warrant repeated listenings. It was meh
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I am totally addicted to this show.  So disappointed that Season 3 is not Prime :/<br />But it's a great show.
B005URRCUY|4.0|Got this as a gift and liked it a lot. I'm not too up on the music now days but a good overall CD to rock out to
B00499QUK2|5.0|Love the series and the actors are a new find. No aware of these actors but glad to meet them. Love the mini-movie feel and that I get a true story out of each episode. Glad I decided to take a look.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|Was this terrible ? No, but it sure came close. It was dumb fun and it held an 8 yearolds attention well enough
B008133MDK|5.0|Never read the books but the stories are captivating and the actors are great. Love that each it like a mini-movie. Surprised that there are so few episodes each season but then realized that as mini-movies it allows better story development. Cannot wait for season 3.
B004ZN9RWK|2.0|I didn't give it one start because a certain person in my house likes Pink Floyd. To me it's garbage music and terrible. That is all
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time Candy Crush mad it's way to the kindle. I'm a candy crush junkie ! I play on my laptop cell phone &amp; now on my kindle fire. Happy girl.....
B0093QHWLC|1.0|While the theme of the movie was nice, the language was just absurd. I got to where we could not focus on the movie because we heard soooo much foul language in regular conversation. I would have been different if the mood was really tense every time they used the language but it was in normal conversation scenarios. In the real world, I don't know any people that use that kind of language in regular conversation. So, to use it throughout a movie where it really does not add anything other than just having foul language, it ruined the movie for my wife and I.
B00FGJNS72|5.0|Polaris is the best software I have used so far to look at and modify MS office documents.  It meets my needs when on the go.
B005PK57IK|4.0|The entire season was excellent as usual.  The final episode is a real cliff hanger - can't give any details without giving the excitement away.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|LOVE SUPERNATURAL AND THIS DVD SET. I PURCHASED IT FOR AN AMAZING DEAL ON AMAZON WITH FREE PRIME SHIPPING! ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF THE SHOW WILL LOVE THIS SEASON! GRANTED, IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS SEASONS BUT WHO CAN REALLY COMPLAIN WITH JENSEN AND JARED IN EVERY EPISODE? THOUGHT SO.
B003K16P50|5.0|Great movie, great book.  I am always glad when a good book is made into a movie that actually captures the essence of the book.  If I had a choice though, I would choose the book over the movie.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Love the Walking dead and the fact its filmed just down the road from us is pretty cool too!  We recognize a lot of the places in the show.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a great book.  I enjoyed the twists and turns created by Gillian Flynn.  She is a master story teller.
B00ENFS0F0|5.0|This is a great TV show. And still is after all this time. So sad they can't make Tv shows like is any more.I am getting every season. But do wait until they come down to about $50.00 a season..
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I know the app is free, but just like many other games, its free until a certain point where it doesn't force, but almost makes you buy credits so that you can keep playing.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is an older movie, but one that was filmed with a great story line.  A young girl is upset that she has to (once again) babysit her baby brother.  In her anger, she &#34;wishes&#34; that the goblins would come and take her brother away... which they do.  The movie is about the ins and outs of a very odd labyrinth which she must solve in order to save her brother from becoming the possession of the Goblin king.  David Bowie sings several songs in the movie, but is not the main focus.  This is a good family movie
0307476073|5.0|Great book, great TRUE story, I would love to meet this girl in person. This is a great read for anyone who travels or wants to travel.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is brilliant.  I can't say enough,  It speaks for itself (if you don't believe me, just download the sample).
B005HSL626|5.0|I bought this a million years ago and forgot to write a review, you get addicted and then soon enough you get sick of it, download it for free for a month of fun.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|This sounded like a fun premise: a murdered cop gets the chance to wipe some stains off his record by serving with a group of afterlife policemen who hunt rogue ghosts. A bit like a supernatural &#34;Men in Black,&#34; really. Unfortunately, &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; didn't live up to its premise.<br /><br />Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) is a cop with a secret. During a drug bust he and his partner turned up some mysterious chunks of gold which, in a moment of weakness, they hid instead of turning in. He wants to use the gold to make a better life for himself and his wife, but after a conversation with her, he decides to do the right thing and turn it in instead. But before he can do so, he's murdered by a close ally and finds himself shanghaied into the R.I.P.D.--the Rest in Peace Department. There, he's paired with sarcastic, out-of-control old-timey sheriff Roy (Jeff Bridges) and set to the task of hunting down rogue ghosts, or 'deados,' that plague humanity.<br /><br />All of the characters are one-note: Nick is the freewheeling Action Good Guy, Roy is the Acerbic Old-Timer with a Hidden Tragedy, and it never gets any deeper than that. Mary Louise Parker is probably the most appealing as Proctor, the sarcastic Tough Police Chief, but she wasn't given nearly enough to do and seemed to exist mainly to prop up Roy and Nick. Kevin Bacon is Hayes, Nick's former partner, who I'm fairly sure was sleepwalking through 90% of the movie.<br /><br />The story never moves beyond plain action movie setpieces with a minimum of supernatural trappings on top. I have a high tolerance for silly and insubstantial action, but &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34; just felt mechanical. You could almost see it checking off the to-do list. &#34;Okay, we have the high-speed chase . . . the moment where the stakes are raised because oh *#&$, the heroes messed up . . . the egregious slow-mo . . . Done. You're entertained now.&#34; No, &#34;R.I.P.D.&#34;, I'm not.<br /><br />I give it two stars for the promising premise and a few moments of genuine laughs. Overall, though, I'd say skip it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun..VERY addicting! If not for the 5 lives given at a time..I would play it all day! LOVE THIS GAME!
B005PK553C|4.0|Scary and fun! I couldn't stop watching it. The characters, both dead and alive, are outstanding. Good twists to keep every show a surprise. Looking forward to Season 2.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's a well done series with a great cast,  good stories and good humor. .  It is well worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and the graphics are great, but I don't like how it can be somewhat hard to make the money you need to buy things like good saddles and bridle. But like I said over all it is a really fun game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love  this apps so much and I can play if for ever please get this app it's awesome but I have problems with sometime but hardly<br />It's just when I want to buy like if I want the goth girl it's just has a lot of line but it might not do that to you
B00471Z3CI|4.0|I remember being terrified from this movie when I was in my teens.  We just showed it to our 12 & 13 year old daughters and they loved it.  The story holds up even after 30 years and is still scary.  Of course it's fun to see all the things from the 80's that date it, but the base story is still scary and could be done in any time period.  We were in total delight when the oldest screamed at a part toward the end. :)
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|AWSOME! The storyline great was great.  They did a great job on the characters.  Kept me watching. I like the way they introduced Kahn, and Carol Marcus. Great Job!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This was a great game but I just updated it and now it won't open. It just brings me to the Amazon app store. I'd give it a better rating if this update hadn't screwed things up.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|It's ok but it won't work sometimes unless u rate it<br />Thank God it's free if I had to pay it would be a rip off. I say that because most of the times it doesn't work and the record button part never works
B0019IB0II|5.0|This book is a wonderful read and highly enlightening for anyone that wants a deeper understanding of how our brains work and help us integrate this life experience . So much to contemplate from reading this. So heart opening and real.<br />I found reading this and then reading The Reason I Jump, brought forward so many thoughts about how Jill's work is invaluable to anyone working with an autistic child, just as it is for anyone working with a person recovering from a stroke. Excellent books!
B00821OX98|5.0|I'd heard of this show but somehow missed it on television. I watched the first two seasons in three days, it was that good. Wonderful writing, characterizations, and settings. Sometimes series like these lose their focus. Not this one. It keeps evolving.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I love this movie, I have also read the book and I feel that it did a good job at capturing the highlights and had thematic additions that I enjoyed. I recommend the book (Wettest County in the World) and the movie!
B00DJWV11I|3.0|The story being told from a male point of view made it an interesting change of pace. Is it just me or does Drew remind you of Harvey on the TV series Suits?  It didn't hurt that I could picture him. Over all the book was entertaining. I would read more by this author.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great product specially given its low price. There is a lag in the audio on tv when a video is played on my computer. Would recommend using the chromecast for picture vieweing, website surfing etc.. not really made for video in my opinion.
B00ECJ18HO|4.0|I'm not a big mystery fan but try to read a classic now and then to broaden my horizons.  This was really well done and I can see why it is a classic.  Kept me interested throughout and held many surprises along the way.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Both SG1 and SG Atlantis are terrific shows.  I can watch the episodes over and over.  Also the SG1 movies are great.  Star gate Universe lost something.  They made big mistakes with that spin off.  They also alienated the fans by ending SG Atlantis too soon.<br />A lot of action and different series not like so many shows that are just the same old thing over and over.  Both SG1 and SGAtlantis present shows with characters  and situation unlike most any show that came before.  Start with SG1 and follow the stories until the spin off then watch both SG1 and atlantis together, until the end.  Then you have the SG1 movies to finish off the series.  There is also Star Gate universe which was ok but they just didn't give you a cast you want to really interact with or care about.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Little disappointed that I can not use with my laptop but it works well with my tablet and droid smartphone.
B000QELMF2|5.0|Beautiful detail on this figure.  delighted with it.  Very good price compared to the shop.  I look forward to giving it to my daughter as part of her collection.
B00BGD8CFK|3.0|Using this for a 5s. I didn't have high expectations coming in as cases are quite disposable these days.  I chose it for it's looks and to have some protection while being slim.  It looks great and is the right amount of slim. It has enough overlap so that the screen does not touch when face down with only a small lip.  It's lacking grip on the back and sometimes I have to snap the phone all the way back into place when I remove from my pocket.  Other than those two aspects i'm pretty happy.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I hadn't read any Steven King for some years and now I remember why.  He sets up a story that leads into a frightening scene and then drops it.  Make up your own ending.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great book! Its a fun ride with twists and turns and some great surprises! Good for most ages!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you thank you for finally getting to the Kindle fire.  As a Candy Crush addict this just helps fed the addiction so much more for me.  Especially since I don't have a cell phone!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read this year! Maybe because all the references to things i love and grew up with but its just a very fun ride! If you love video games and 80s pop culture you must read this book....go read it now!
B001EC2IT4|3.0|Enjoyed the funny antics on how ghosts and humans should get along. Have fun with this movie.  Great for Halloween!
B00G32OER4|4.0|The story was compelling. The movie was not cheesey. The acting was believable. I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for a FRIGHT NIGHT!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great fun game building your own city, telling your vehicles where to go. Once you get stuck and have no more credits to continue your quest to the next level you have to buy credits to get farther or start all over again for free. Does not have a log in feature that I can see so you lose your game status if you reinstall it again at a later time for instance when your tablet crashes and you have to do a factory reset. Needs to have a log in feature so you can continue where you left off in the game and continue with your purchased credits you haven't used yet.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I had not watched one episode of this series when it aired originally, but made a mental note to get to one day. Thrilled to find the complete series on Amazon's Prime Videos and am currently blitzing thru each and every show. I can highly recommend it! This series is fantastic! Acting is superior and writing incredible! Kindle Fire has excellent sound quality and I just can't say enough about this series or the ease of use/downloading on the Kindle Fire! Thanks Amazon!
B008602KQI|5.0|The books are always better to read, but this movie was still and awesome movie, it is a must see!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual Stephen King writes another great book.  Must read for any fan of The Shining.  Some surprise twists and turns.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love the game, and colors, my kids and myself love it, it's easy to play and keeps your mind busy!
B001BANK32|5.0|Read this book when it first came out and loved it.  Bought it for my Kindle Fire to read again before Stephen King's sequel &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34; came out to refresh my memory.  Still as chilling and scary as I remember.  So much better then the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|In  my opinion this is his best yet. As a southerner I see his characters as believable. It seems as if he knows some of the attorneys in my part of the world. His locations of timberlands and sawmills are logical. I know people with the same flaws and/or ambitions as those in his story. This one I will read again.
B004BCNVOA|4.0|Best known for her edgy pop style music and portraying the power of a very strong willed woman in most of her songs, singer and songwriter Pink certainly has not swayed from this in her \\"Raise Your glass\\" video from her latest album: Greatest hits...So far!!!    Pink wouldn't have it any other way with her tribute to the \\"underdogs\\" of the world in her video...from her magnificent portrayal of Rosie the Riveter, a tribute to the social movement of the working woman during WWII, or her quirky way of bringing out the nerd in all of us by joining a fellow nerd on the school dance floor, unaffected by those around.    There are alot of visual statements throughout the video that take us on a ride through what may be deemed as \\"not normal\\" or \\"unaccepted\\", to a celebration of these characters who are considered out of place in society, such as hanging with the city gangsters and skateboarders, or singing at a wedding of two gay men or just celebrating our differences regardless of race, color or religion.    Pink does not shy on raising the eyebrows of her audience in such scenes as sumo wrestling Big Business on Wall Street, slaying a Matador instead of a bull, the milking of women's breasts to feed a calf and sleeping with religious figures, waking to her empty drink and stating \\"this sucks\\".    In one interview Pink stated,\\" the reason I wrote Raise Your Glass is because it's a celebration of being an underdog. Instead of becoming a cover girl and endorsement girl and a popular girl and having number ones - I mean I've had one number one in my entire career - I just hit the road and pounded the pavement and became a touring artist. That has been a huge accomplishment for me. You don't have to be popular when you're a touring artist; you just have to be good. This album is a celebration and a thank you to everybody for hanging out with me for so long.\\"    Overload? No.  It's awesome and not any different than what we expect from someone such as Pink. What better entertainer to shoot such a video who sings \\"so raise your glass if you are wrong-in all the right ways-all my underdogs-we will never ever be anything but loud and nitty gritty dirty little freaks\\".    Seriously think of where we have all been in some of these situations.  Were we accepting or embarrassed by the actions of ourselves or others?  Pink is trying to make us think and be aware of our personal uniqueness and have us look into ourselves and not be afraid to stand up for ourselves.  Underdogs, freaks & fools, time to raise your glass!    Watch it here:[...]
B005HP2JAM|4.0|Although the video quality was an initial disappointment, the narrative combined to create a thrilling history of an early storyteller.<br />I was deeply moved by the film.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I  don't normally watch commercial TV programming because it just doesn't measure up. I was surprised at how good this series was and really enjoyed seeing it commercial free on Amazon Prime.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Game is not free. You cant play without being asked for money to continue. I hate that. If you want more money just charge up front for the game. Total B.S...Waste of time.

B00ECU1A6C|3.0|My 8 year old loves My Little Pony. And we discovered during a recent car ride that a friend of her 11 year old brother also loves them. A BRONY! In my car! The car ride became far more entertaining after that--just listening to an 8 year old boy go from talking about Nerf guns to the various attributes of different ponies...awesomely entertaining.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot sit through this movie. But apparently 8 year old girls and some 11 year old boys can...
B00FEB09VA|5.0|I thought this was wonderful as did my husband. We were looking for a movie to watch one evening & this was perfect for us. We laughed and cried (even my husband).  It was very touching!!
B0000UJDLM|4.0|My 8 year old daughter can quote almost every line of this movie. For years they had heard me say, &#34;Noooooo disassemble number 5&#34; and had no idea what I was talking about. My 11 year old son who is a budding computer programmer also enjoyed the movie. They were entertained by the 80s aspect of it too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and was so excited when Amazon finally decided to get  with the program and  have it available for us kindle owners. I was beginning to regret getting the kindle over a tablet but not anymore my Kindle is complete!

B00BJ64FU0|4.0|Protip:  When you're reading the &#34;Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,&#34; stop when you reach the chapter entitled &#34;The Final Problem&#34;  STOP reading.  Read &#34;Hound of the Baskervilles,&#34; then go back, read Final Problem, and continue as normal.  This is the proper chronological order, as HOB does not take into account events of FP, and FP is the prequel event to the book immediately following HOB.<br /><br />But aside from that, this is a great book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|entertaining, fun and definitly passes the time. great app that works great on my kindle fire. would recommend this  to friends
0316228583|2.0|Our book club read this book, as many are fans of her work...but of the dozen women that started it, only three of us read the entire book - -no one liked it.  The story is well written, but there was not a single character to care about.  With J. K. Rowling's talent - -she could write any story - -so why this one?!!  Would not recommend it -- -nor will I buy another of her books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive, I can't stop playing it. And it is a great game for waiting for the doctor, or any appointment. My daughter is contained and quiet while waiting.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I had no idea who Passenger was before his single, Let Her Go was released on the radio.  I bought the album on a whim because I love that song and I've since said that the purchase was one of the better life decisions I've made.  I absolutely love the album.  There is a song or two that I don't love as much as the rest, but the vast majority of them have either touching or hilarious lyrics, great music, and are easy to sing along to like a fool in the car.<br /><br />Not all of the lyrics are suitable for kids, so you'll get some sideways glances from any children old enough to understand some of the (bad) words.  But, I find the honesty in his songs so refreshing that I just sort of gloss over those words.  They work and they make sense in every case.  His voice is so different from all of the pop junk that is out today- it's soothing and interesting at the same time.<br /><br />If you like Let Her Go, you'll love the album.  I know I did.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|There are plenty of post-apocalyptic books out there nowadays, but Brandon Sanderson is such an epic novelist, such a great writer and he does not disappoint in this novel. It is well written, fast paced and leaves you with enough twists and surprises that you are hungrily wanting more! Well done!
B005LAII62|5.0|IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not an animated movie that should be seen by any small child. I would say age 12+ due to occasional foul language and certain situations. If your child is a preteen or teen then there should be no major problems.<br /><br />I'm 28 and must say I highly enjoyed the movie! I thought the characters were perfect, the story unraveled well and at a good pace and it really kept me interested. I was dying to know how it was going to end and I must say I was satisfied by the finish.<br /><br />The main plot of the story is that a schoolkid named Normon is constantly ostracized and put down by most others (from classmates to his family) because he can see and talk to ghosts. He spends a good amount of time watching scary movies and talking to his grandma (who happens to have passed away but still inhabits Norman's family's home). He goes to school and most people just don't understand where he's coming from, like, ever. He goes through the school day trying to pay attention to what happens around him but often he is distracted by ghosts that are everywhere!<br /><br />What I really, really liked about the movie was the message of how someone who is sometimes very gifted can be a total outcast in life. I thought that the ending with Agatha (or how she puts it \\"Aggy\\") was extremely heartfelt. There are quite a few spots in the movie that will make you stop and think, \\"Aww!!\\".<br /><br />Some of the inappropriate (at least for children) stuff that occurs is the use of words like \\"jackass\\", \\"hell\\", a schoolkid mentioning the \\"adult movie store\\" nearby and the same schoolkid touching Norman's older sister's butt (although it's just implied and not actually shown). Basically if you are 12 or older there probably isn't anything that will stun you too much (unless you grew up highly religious and you aren't even allowed to say stuff like \\"holy cow\\" or the similar).<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />5 stars!<br /><br />P.S. My favorite characters were the chubby kid, Norman and Norman's mother.he chubby kid, Norman and Norman's mother.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King demonstrates in this novel why he is a bestselling writer.  I always considered The Stand to be my favorite King novel.  However, I am afraid that Dr. Sleep has surpassed The Stand.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I enjoy the series  and on my second viewing.  missed some of the dialog first time around.,<br />but I don't care for the daughter, maybe it's the way she's written into the series.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Would recommend for all ages. Excellent story line and well drawn.  Brings out the meaning of Christmas in a way that all ages can understand.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Love the show as I mentioned  in season 3,  same feelinf about the daughter.  other wise  it would get four stars

125000098X|5.0|Archer is a fantastic author.  I never skip a page in any of his books.  Can hardly wait until 2014 when the next in his series of The Chronicle comes out.  I have read almost all of his other books.  The man is so well educated and has such a overwhelming imagination.  I recommend his books (ALL OF THEM) to everyone who likes to read.  And, re-read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A Secret - who knows what one little secret can do?  The lives of these great characters are all effected by this one life changing secret.  The fact that the secret is a secret for so long through the book makes this a fun read.  I enjoyed trying to figure it out and seeing how each character interacted.  Funny, sad and a make you think book.
1250000971|5.0|see above.  Archer is the best author around.  The English authors do not have to dwell on pages of sexual encounters between two people in bed.  If you are a grown-up, you have enough imagination of your own to fill in the blanks and not have to read about people sticking their tongues in each other's mouths.  Or, going into graphic details of a man entering a woman's vaginal.  We Americans, I think, are somewhat immoral.  However, we get enough of that from Nora Roberts and company.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|this movie reminded me of the Matrix with a lot of sifi, it was good but I would not rent it over
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|My son loves trains. I have bought many tracks and trains and the Chuggington series is by far his favorite. I disagree with the other reviews. I have not had problems with mine fitting other sets.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|its a zombie movie, it was good for what it was I will not rent this movie over but it was ok
B004HHKFIY|5.0|If your child likes Chuggington this is a must have. My son does so many creative things with trains. When adding trains he \\"knows\\" it is so much more fun! A must have for your little one.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|So I was turned onto this series by my husband. I have to say as the story goes on I find myself reading faster to see what is going to happen. Love this series and I will continue to read this series :)

B00EUUJID6|5.0|As always Il Volo comes through as the bright new stars that they are.  Their voices are magnificent, singly and when put together are out of this world.  They give new life and joy to the Christmas songs with which we are familiar.  Bravo and bravo!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Lots of twists turns and surprises in this book in the 'Game of Thrones' series. I am nearly finished and can't wait to start the next book.'<br />It is a long book. but worth reading every word.<br />Just remember,'winter is coming.'
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game.  Very addictive.  You have to be connected with Facebook with friends so you can get the full advantage of the game. If not you will have to pay for lives if you don't have to wait.
B000A6EXNO|5.0|Added this to my D800.  When looking through the viewfinder, keeps distracting side light out of your eye enabling you see clearly and see the readings in the camera.  Worth getting.
B001NAT05W|2.0|What a horrible, sad little film. I was excited about Catwoman for several reasons: I like Batman, Spiderman, X-Men, and those other super-people stories; I have a cat; AND...Halle Berry [well, I don't have her, but you know what I mean..]. As it turned out, however, the only thing redeemable about this flick was Berry's bod in her outfit, hence the bonus star. Everything else was miserable and warranted the most dismal 1-star ranking.<br /><br />So what's the problem, you ask? Character development was atrocious. Berry's character dies near the beginning, and I didn't even care. There's no reason to! We only just met her, and her demise is handed to her in such a way as to be completely unrelateable to normal people's experiences. At least batman experienced a mugging gone horribly wrong, spiderman had his crush as did superman, and the X-men/people experienced xenophobia and were a statement about humankind's treatment of the Other.<br /><br />But Catwoman? Vacuous. She dies a lame death, and is magically given life again and powers by some cartoonish cat's stank fish breath. The subsequent stunt work is awful, and the editors tried to conceal this fact with rapid-fire images lasting less than a second from a dozen different angles, leaving your head spinning. Utterly unimpressed. With batman and superman, we see the develop of a costume from personal parts of their life--it's a process--THAT is character development. With Catwoman, she puts on some leather bit from her closet that was foreshadowed at the beginning. Big deal. She flirts with some cop dude, but there's no romance there, nothing trying to keep them apart that they have to fight for, and in the end the relationship is all but forgotten, so why should we care about her or them as a couple? We shouldn't, and don't.<br /><br />Lastly, all the best superhero-type stories are fighting for something big. Something noble. Sometimes that thing is external, sometimes it's an internal struggle, and other times it's a smart mix of both (X-Men). What is the focus of Catwoman's battle? Addictive makeup/skincare-products that put ONE person in the hospital briefly. BFD.<br /><br />Don't waste your $3 on this cat vomit.it's a smart mix of both (X-Men). What is the focus of Catwoman's battle? Addictive makeup/skincare-products that put ONE person in the hospital briefly. BFD.<br /><br />Don't waste your $3 on this cat vomit.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|Wanted a case that I could quickly access my most used filters.  Quickly attaches to my belt.  Velcro and a snap keeps it safely in place and within easy reach when I need the filters.
B0000062GE|5.0|Yes, awesome CD, loved every track. Too bad a lot of people did not get to discover the band at their peak.

1419705849|5.0|I love it and I knew it was good because my daughter read it many times, which give me some quiet time in the house.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Im hooked on this game and excited to see that I can play it on my kindle fire. Best game ever!!!
B00EEDJM2Q|3.0|Animation is fun, for my non-puzzle mind it was a bit challenging. It was good to pass short periods of time waiting, or when I wanted a mindless time-passer. I think it would be fun for kids and would help exercise pattern recognition. I used it for a month or two and moved on.
B00BATKPBE|3.0|This is a nice look at Dawkins' early life, his family and where he lived his formative years.  For those interested in him as a scientist or as a spokesperson for humanist/non-theist views, this will give some background to the man.  If you have read his previous books, it is also a nice add-on.  Beyond that, it is &#34;just okay&#34;.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Usually, when I'm playing movies while drawing or gaming, I can keep abreast of the plot and action... but this film did not keep my attention at all. The visuals were cute, the actors appeared to be okay, but it wasn't as imaginative as I expected. When they can combine modern special effects while maintaining the charm of the original, THEN it will keep my attention!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was great so many twist and turns. I will continue to watch and enjoy. Very refreshing I will recommend to family and friends.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|So far, this app has been very useful in keeping up my calendar. I wish it had more icons (the icons are cute and fun but WAY too normal... they should have icons for geeks, not just soccer moms!), I note that most of them would appeal to teenage girls and women anyway... where's the guy appeal? (Not that I'm a guy)<br /><br />The meat of this app, however, works extremely well and I enjoy it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Wonderful book!  Beautifully written. But, I am in mourning.  No 3rd book, yet.  I miss the characters. I miss the world. Highly recommend these books.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very satisfying in that wonderfully disturbing way that Mr. Stephen King does oh so well.  Thank you for all the delightfully imaginative frights.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wish I hadn't started the trilogy. I wish I hadn't started the trilogy.  I wish I hadn't started the trilogy!  Books one and two fair.  Book three felt rushed and poorly conceived.  There are thousands of titles that I may read over a lifetime, but tens of thousands of good books out there.  When I find an author that has disappointed, I must move on and leave that author behind, especially when I invested so much time in reading a trilogy.  As an aside, I also hated the ending.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Almost never go wrong buying a cd from Tedeschi Trucks Band they were both excellent in their own careers and are better together.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Thankfully, this novel validated my feeling that the \\"story\\" that was told to the people in Chicago in Insurgent (book 2) didn't make sense.  However, actions of the characters and the extent of chemical/scientific abilities seemed so unbelievable--even laughable at times--to me, that I couldn't enjoy the book overall.  Some of the characters had a lot of heart.  And, the ending was pretty rough on me (even though I knew that something would happen).  But, overall, the story arc of the last two novels never seemed as engaging or valid as the first novel, Divergent.  In fact, this will be one of the trilogies, like Matched, where I'll feel that I have to caveat any recommendations of the first book in the series by warning them that it goes downhill after that.
B002Z0TPFE|4.0|This is the best of the two, why is it they always feel they must change everything the effects were awesome though
0767827902|5.0|If a dramatic movie is judged by the degree to which it makes the viewer feel that they are in that town with those people, experiencing what they are experiencing, feeling what they are feeling... then this movie deserves way more than 5 Stars, because it succeeds 100% in every way.<br /><br />I have just seen the regular version of this truly one of a kind and phenomenal film on TCM, and can't wait to see the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Also, One of the other reviewers said it's not realistic that anyone from that small town could drive to an expensive home with an indoor swimming pool. Well, I can tell you that it is...<br /><br />I grew up in a small town area.  Oakdale, CA is not as tiny as the town in this movie, and it's definitely not poor with places closing all over (just the opposite) BUT there ARE several very small towns around here that Do resemble the town in the movie and they Are all within about a half hour drive from many very large expensive homes with pools.  So I can tell you that this one thing in this movie is 100% believable and realistic.

B001O304US|5.0|With the success of \\"Behaviour\\", the Pet Shop Boys entered the 1990s with strong confidence and creativity. The years between 1990 and 1993 saw a musical world changing before their eyes. 80s pop or pop metal were either dead or dying, alternative rock and hip-hop had reigned supreme and electronic music began to move from melodic synthpop to a more adventurous, ambient and dance-oriented sound, illustrated by ground-breakers like Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, the Orb and Moby.<br /><br />Yet despite the changes that were occurring, Chris Lowe and Mike Tennant stuck to their guns. In 1993, they released \\"Very\\", which refined the catchy, beat-driven music of their 80s albums and merge it with the seductive, intensely personal material of \\"Behaviour\\". Smacked in the middle of the grunge revolution, \\"Very\\" became a huge commercial success (at least in the UK) and deservedly so. Not only is \\"Very\\" the Pet Shop Boys' best album, it's one of the greatest electronic music albums of all time.<br /><br />\\"Very\\" is the work of a pair of musicians at the height of their creative powers, filled with extraordinary songs that took the introspective themes of \\"Behaviour\\" and magnified them. That this came out around the time when Tennant revealed his homosexuality is no coincidence; the revelation allows the band to take risks and explore lyrics that they were hesitated to explore earlier. The music is stronger, the melodies are richer and the dance arrangements more intoxicating.<br /><br />\\"Behaviour\\" had excellent singles and some great album tracks, but ALL the tracks on \\"Very\\" are excellent, starting with the opening three tracks that stands as classics of electronic pop. The intense \\"Can You Forgive Her?\\", about a woman mocking her boyfriend for being infatuated with his male friend; the cheeky, irresistible \\"I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing\\" deals with repressed emotions; and \\"Liberation\\" is a beautiful, piano-driven dance track that improves on the seductive groove of \\"Being Boring\\" and \\"So Hard\\".<br /><br />Folks who felt that \\"Behaviour\\" ditched away most of the dance will be delighted to hear that \\"Very\\" has a plethora of excellent songs destined to be played in dance clubs. If it weren't for the 90s production, these songs would have been properly suited for their 1988 album \\"Introspective\\" - the emotionally intense \\"A Different Point of View\\", the purpose-filled \\"Yesterday, When I Was Mad\\", the harrowing \\"One and One Make Five\\", charmingly awkward \\"Theatre\\" and the pulse-driven \\"Young Offender\\" are outstanding, worthy additions to the PSB's already remarkable body of work. In a much less talented pop band's hands, these songs would come across as mechanical and dated. But in the PSB's hands, these songs are infused with strong craftsmanship and powerfully personal songwriting, giving them the emotional depth severely lacking in most dance albums at the time.<br /><br />Shockingly, \\"Very\\"'s artistic peak comes not with the aforementioned songs, but with the cover of a Village People song, \\"Go West\\". When asked to performed at an AIDS charity concert, it was perhaps no surprise that the PSB picked this song. What IS a surprise is how great the cover version is. Hell, it's not great; it's ELECTRIFYING. It was their biggest hit in their entire career and it feels touching that a 1970s song championing the gay culture was now transformed into a profoundly moving anthem to combat the AIDS epidemic.<br /><br />Many have argued as to which PSB album is their best - \\"Actually\\", \\"Introspective\\", \\"Behaviour\\", \\"Very\\", the B-side album, smirkingly titled \\"Alternative\\" or the underrated \\"Bilingual\\". Arguments over each of their merits are entirely justified, but from my money, \\"Very\\" is the pinnacle of the PSB's illustrious career and one of the defining albums of electronic pop music. For beginners, \\"Actually\\" and \\"Behaviour\\" are recommended, but to get the feeling of a great, unjustly maligned band operating at their most assured andcreative, you can't get any better than \\"Very\\".<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to steal at all costs!creative, you can't get any better than \\"Very\\".<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to steal at all costs!

006202406X|4.0|I loved the first two books. This is my favorite series. So naturally, I was super excited to read this when it came out. Unfortunately, it wasn't exactly what I had hoped for. It was filled with plotholes. There was not a lot of character development, and the conflict kind of just... Ended. And I know Roth was going for a more realistic story, one that a happy ending is not always an option. And I was willing to accept Tris's death, as long as there was some kind of hope restored, but the ending left a bleak chance for a happy future. All in all, the book just didn't leave me feeling whole.<br /><br />I could harp about how this was some sort of catastrophic failure that ruined the series, but it wasn't to me. I still love the series. I still love the way Veronica Roth writes. If she writes more books, I will gladly read them. This book just did not show her full potential. She was probably rushed. And she kind of had an unfair disadvantage. Most people go into books without any biases, but people were expecting great things from this because of the first 2 books. It's a lot of pressure to live up to. It was still a really good book, just not everything I had hoped for.

B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this book and can appreciate what different immigrants had to endure.This book felt real to me. I know some orphans who had a sad home life.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I found this app here on Amazon for $4.99.  They wanted $14.99 on the Google App Store, so I jumped at this chance. I had already been using the trial version for a week and really liked it.  After installing this on three Samsung Galaxy devices, we could not access Google Drive on any of them.  I contacted Customer Support at MobiSystems.  They said I needed to download the latest version from their website (why wasn't the latest version here on Amazon?) and gave me an activation code.  I installed the app once again on all three devices, then entered the activation code.  When I entered the code on the second device, it said \\"activation code already used maximum number of times.\\"  I contacted customer support again, and got no response.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a awesome app. I love it!!  Best app out there!! You can do so much stuff. Save cool stuff you like and follow other ppls boards!  And pin anything u like!!👍😃
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting not so patiently for candy crush to be available on my kindle fire. It was definitely worth the wait! I am loving the fact that the game itself displays much larger than it does when I play on FB. It gives my eyes a break. It's integrated with FB so laptop, tablet, and phone offer a seamless experience.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it is a fun game for matching but some of the screens are frustrating. you have to clear a block then clear it again when it is jelly, and if you dont use every single move to clear maximum spaces you dont pass.  I also dont like having to quit and wait a half hour before i cant play the level again.  sometimes that is the only way though that i get to go to bed.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Decided to own my own copies without any advertisements.<br />The advertisements are spoils your concentration. Clean copy is attractive.<br />That's the reason I ordered DVD
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game as much I sick at this game but it's so fun to play that why I comeback and play it more
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS WONDERFUL! I love these movies! Can't wait to see the next few Marvel Movies! Thanks For the Sale
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this game is super fun and defenitley recommend it to everyone including adults! It can be frustrating at times though.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|This movie was very well done. It was well acted, by both children and adults.  Even though Lawrence Fishburne's character had limited screen time, he did a good job of impacting the main character's development.  Despite the usual poetic license, it also seems fairly close to actual events.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Wonderful game. But you don't get to Change the mode to survive or to.creative. but I still love it.  It's a great game to play with friends and family. Because you can join. Also a great game to play on a rainy day.
B00DW39B2K|2.0|To pass an hour it was ok, not a movie I would recommend.<br />Travolta was no belivable and De Niro was not even trying.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I thought this game was fun from the start and now I'm hooked. Definitely a well worth purchase. 5 out of 5 from me.
B00F880BWG|5.0|First off, I love zombies. Second, this show has an awesome story line that I just can't get enough of! Love this show!!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Great book for reference. Easy to use on an iPad and has great short videos which show hundreds of exercises from Easy to Difficult. And it has a log for tracking yuor progress. Was recommended by a colleague who loves it. Now I can why. It is a must have if you want to get in great shape.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|Good game. I notice it lags at time when switching screens, but graphics and gameplay are really good. Would definitively recommend the game.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This album would be a great gift for just about anybody, and I plan to hand out many copies this season to all sorts of people - family, service providers, as hostess gifts - basically to anyone that I want to give a little something to without making them feel obligated to reciprocate and without fear of offending them. There is so much variety here - secular and religious, modern and old, various orchestrations and tempos - that it would be impossible for anyone to not enjoy having it in their seasonal collection of music.<br /><br />The real value, the actual gift of it, is sharing Susan Boyle's voice with people who may not know her beyond the YouTube video.  The quality of her singing is astounding - she's one of the best female vocalists currently recording, in spite of the lowly circumstances of her discovery in a talent show - and anyone who remembers that video will be delighted to find out just how well she's done for herself since then.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Good movie, with a great cast! I like Bruce Willis and this movie is typical for his genre - action/shoot-em' up etc. Very entertaining!
1451666179|5.0|Very happy I bought the physical book version of this book.  It's a solid heavy thing, that was delivered with my Monsters University BluRay and thus confused the house a bit when the unknown package arrived.<br /><br />If it was Allie or her publisher who decided to change page colors per story I have no idea, but they are a genius.  It perfectly fits the writing and was the second thing I noticed.  The first thing was wondering about Scott.<br /><br />Read a few stories last night when I got home from work and really enjoyed it.  Classics, new stuff, and now I have it for ever and ever.  You should buy this book right now.  Go now.  Push the button!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great, loved it.  I watch &#34;The Good Wife&#34; every chance I get.  Amazon Prime is wonderful, I love not having to watch commercials.
B00867HDTA|4.0|A little repetitive but an enjoyable time.  Good. graphics. I'm not a big fan of soccer but I am a fa of this game.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Music from the most talented band on the planet.  Progressive metal isn't for everyone, but these guys continue to lay down masterful songwriting and musicianship album after album.  Check it out when you get a chance and this album might just blow you away!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it I have been waiting for a long time for candy crush saga to come out for my kindle fire
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that I can play offline!  Lots of games are on line<br />Jet only.  Not this great game!  And it's free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was my first time ordering a instant video. It was much cheaper than buying the dvds. I really enjoyed having all the episodes at my fingertips when I wanted them. Was able to watch on my tv and computer.
030758836X|3.0|I really enjoyed this book until the last quarter of it.  It was an interesting format switching back and forth between Nick's and Amy's view points.  It really built, but was such a let down at the end.<br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br />Once Amy is robbed by the thieves in the cabin it just seemed so unbelievable.  It was as if the author got stuck at that point and wasn't sure what else to do with her.  I could have accepted the direction she was going once Desi hid her away at the Lake House if the twist had been that Desi DID keep her a prisoner for the rest of her life giving her her just desserts.  But, having her just show up at home with an outlandish story that the police never really seemed to investigate (other than checking his trunk), come on.  One is given hope when Nick and Go continue to meet and work with Boney, that answers will be found and Amy will be taught her lesson in the end.  Instead, however, we get a wasted section on Nick writing a book about his side of the story only to have him delete it when Amy holds her pregnancy over his head.  He basically just tucks his tail between his legs and lets her win in the end.  Ugh!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I've been playing on my kindle for months after doing a side load. I was hoping it would be a full version when I downloaded from here. Levels only up to 440. I sure hope they update soon. Until then I can only play on my Pc. facebook levels are much higher than 440. Please update!
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|I like the game although it is simple and a good way to pass some time away! Thanks to the creators.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Wish a French teacher had checked this,  I found myself wincing as the language was fractured.  Otherwise a bit unbelievable but not bad for fluff.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited about being to now play Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire.  I haven 't had any problems with it so far.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is a great series if you like historical novels with a little bit of the supernatural thrown in.  I love these books and am devouring them on after another.
B00EMJD6TC|3.0|It is nothing like the book at all but is much better than I expected it to be. I probably wouldn't see it again but it was worth the rental.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|I would imagine that most of the general public, like myself, does not know the relative dangers of nuclear weapons and, especially, how through sheer luck oftentimes and the will of engineers and scientists to put internal controls on these weapons, just how closely we came to numerous nuclear accidents.  To me in reading the genesis of these weapons and how U.S. policy evolved was a true eye-opener.  I was astounded and, frankly, remain convinced more than ever that we have to reduce our nuclear arsenal from the current thousands to hundreds.  This would also include all other nuclear nations to follow accordingly.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.  I read it in several long sessions, amazed by the detail and technical prowess of the author.  This book should become the source document for the anti-nuclear forces in the world!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|If you are watching season 4 of the walking dead you probably don't need my rating to tell you that you like it.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Atwood's entire MaddAddam trilogy, posit worlds that are possible, and frankly terrifying. Much like her previous novel, The Handmaid's Tale, the dystopian world of MaddAddam is entirely plausible. Which should make you realize that we humans should probably pay attention.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I have to admit, at no point was I angry that it wasn't William Shatner or Leonard Nimoy. It is very much worth the watch
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I like automatic (self winding) dive watches and have had several over the past 30 odd years.  (My last one did a suicidal leap overboard and is on the bottom of the ocean.)  This one is very well made and robust and performs exactly as expected.  I have not yet taken it diving but I don't expect any trouble with it given Seiko's reputation.  While you can spend a lot more, and certainly less, this is a nice price point.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its fun ,thought provoking, some levels are frustrating and not intended to be won. this creates the temptation to quit playing. the game seems to sense the urge to quit and will allow a win. but all in all its a good game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Came out when I was in college and I missed reading it.  Had always wanted to and picked it up for a plane ride the other day -- wasn't disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books of the series and was really excited about this one.  However, I was very disappointed.  I did not care for the two main characters going back and forth chapter by chapter telling the story from their side of view.  The story was so great that the author could have written another book from Tobias' point of view.  I was so used to Tris being the storyteller and I feel it hurt the flow of the book.  I was most disappointed about the ending.  That can ruin a book for me and unfortunately it tarnished the whole series for me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love a book like this where I will miss. The main characters. I felt that way about The Stand and 11.22.1963 as well. I also love that King showed that his praise of Harry Potter books was sincere. There's a little Hogwarts in this novel, but on a much darker and more adult level. That only amplifies the reading pleasure, though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY.  My favorite game is now available on my kindle fire.  And it's free.  This is the best and most addicting game. Love playing it on my kindle.  Well done
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Finally have time watch some of the programming I didn't have time for before retirement. Love the characters on this series. And the fact that a lot is available. Highly recommend.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Thank you Mr. Patrick, I needed that. I found your book to be very inspiring. After falling sick from a pancreatic conduction and found it hard to start again
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I'm having fun so far on this game. I am going to keep playing it and will post more comments in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy it's finally on Kindle!!! It's an awesome app. This game is highly addictive. Love love love it.  Download now...lol
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like this app because easily, and available from anywhere. I always forget everything still now. This is a nice try, and i wish good luck to the dev team.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Amazing game! My three year old niece loves this game. Helps her to learn letters and also to identify different animals. The colors and pictures are attractive. This game is fun, educative and age appropriate. My niece never get bored playing it. Highly recommend this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have loved Candy Crush for a while now but had to limit it to my phone.  I absolutely love it on my Kindle since the screen is much bigger than my phone.  I still may be stuck on the same level... but at least I can see the screen better.  Thanks for finally bringing it home to my Kindle Fire..  I really enjoy it.  And one day I will get off this level.  LOL.
B001BANK32|4.0|This book was immensely creepy and was almost a little too much for me. Loved the ending and looking forward to reading the sequel.
B00CKURWTK|5.0|My 6 year old daughter loves to read tho book. The pictures hold her attention and motivate her to practice her reading. I love it because it gives he a good 20 minutes of practice.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was a page turner!!  I bought this book not knowing what to expect. The writing reminded me of The Stand because it had such good characters.  This is a book I will read again!  I raved about this book so much, my husband is now reading it and loving it too!
B000006OBQ|4.0|This CD is a lot of fun to listen to.  I love this time period for music and entertainment.  Frank Sinatra sings and talks with the audience on this CD.  Very nice quality recording.
141694737X|5.0|I wrote to the zoo for lots of different pets, but only one pet was right for me!  What a fun way to discover which one.  A good book for beginning readers.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This Roman Polanski comedy is one of my favorite films.  It was fun to see Sharon Tate in this one.  The look of the movie is beautiful.
6305910340|5.0|I love this movie - it a beautiful story and the acting is very good.  You will fall in love with this little kid who has a talent for Chess and to compete but has a very gentle soul.
0764169742|5.0|This beautiful book is one of my favorites of the botanical books I have.  It will be nice to have to practice my own botanical art.  Lovely.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a very compelling book and story.  I read this on a recommendation from a friend and did not know what it was about or what to expect.  The book keeps you reading to see what happens next in the lives of each character - the ups and downs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun. I literally can play for hours on end...my entire family is addicted we love it.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|Interesting take on marketing a book. Interesting point of view. In conflict with what other have written on the subject but I would say John was the most successful one to write on this topic. Take that for what it is - probably the most successful approach.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I watch all types of different movies that are related to the paranormal and claim to come from a true event. This movie successfully creeped me out. A few scenes I could barely watch lol. Bravo!! Pretty great acting as well and ensemble cast. The \\"real\\" pictures they show at the end were scary as hell... My friend said he read the books this film was based on... very dark, interesting stuff. Reminds me of the Annaliese Michel case a little...
B00EH49DXA|5.0|I really like the depth of the lyrics and the great story telling. It is nice to appreciate an artist rather than just a singer.
B00FI7XBIS|1.0|It's an ok game for pc, but yoy have toshoot towards items you can't see because they do'n fit un your space... I don't know... It's just not right succeding by chance in spite of your hability. Installed, tested, deleted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so good one could spend hours playing with out knowing. Thank you Amazon for finally offering us this awesome app
B00AHSF4AQ|5.0|Great movie and my kids love it! They love the colorful, very clear HD quality!! Recommend it to every one!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Helps keep kindle clean and ram free. Everyone should have this on their kindle  tablet or phone . Give it a try you won't be disappointed.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It is great quality combined with excellent design with reasonable<br /> cost--I would highly recommend this watch to anyone to purchase<br />Thank You
B00E0SX118|5.0|I really love this movie! It  is a good family movie. I  laughed plenty,  my 5 year old loves it so much she wants to watch it over and over again.
B00005KARK|5.0|My fav disney movie , besides the little mermaid a must have.  the pic quality is good . its a film ahead of its time with great music and a great story that is feel good and heartwarming and sometimes a little sad .
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Awesome movie. Very compelling and an awesome story. Excellent visuals and costumes and makeup. Pleasantly surprised. It was the first time I was happy that a movie had a long running time because I enjoyed every minute and wasn't ready for it to end.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the series but was disappointed that Veronica Roth did not give us a happy ending. But I do understand the reasoning. Overall, I love the characters and the story.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|Return of the Living Dead pt 2 is a hilarious entertaining Halloween movie as it was intended to be when originally released 20+ years ago. It was not supposed to make sense and the dead were supposed to look like they stepped out of the \\"Thriller\\" video.  As for the score and the different music in the vhs and now dvd versions it tells you on the box that some of the score and music has been altered for that particular devices, if you clowns would look you know that.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Worth seeing but not as good as I expected.  I don't want to be too hard on it but give it a half hour and see if you like it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought this was a very good book I finished in 3 days and I couldn't put the book down
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This is a great book about how you learn a skill, what motivates one to learn it and what kind of teacher can make  it happen faster.<br /><br />Turns traditional teaching and learning upside down
B00B3VB9TQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. And that's saying something. Here, example...<br /><br /> I have 140 something books on my kindle. Another 200 or so on my bookshelves. In all of these books, this rates near top of the top 20. This book makes me want to cry, laugh, gasp and hold my breath in anticipation. I hold this opinion because of the futuristic charm. No matter where you are, this book is worth every cent.<br /><br />Tally (main character) is so, so... So... Well, so Tally. Unlike normal  books, she actually thinks much the same as everyone else. Unlike Shay. After spending time in the great outdoors,though, she knows the big secret of the operation (nope, not telling) and suddenly is much less sheep-like i.e not doing exactly what she's told and not questioning the suspicious results. I love her more than any character in this book.<br /><br />Shay makes me shake my head in wonder, surprises  me with her different opinions and makes me sometimes want to jump into the story to defend her (or Tally) against wrong accusations.<br /><br />David. He is the leader of the Smokies, a band of uglies who ran away from the operation. He is a very down to earth guy that I think is a natural born leader. He and Tally fall for each other, and are possibly perfect. He is a bit TO perfect though, if you ask me. Not my favourite.<br /><br />Despite some annoying characters ( dr Cable, Peris, David's parents, eta) this book touched me and made me laugh, all at once! I love it, and hopefully, so will you. Well done, Scott.<br /><br />READ IT!
B008HK3TXK|4.0|I really love the print of this jacket case.  I am slightly concerned about the velcro closure, which is why I am only giving it 4 stars.  It seems to pull and I'm afraid that over time it may present an issue, but otherwise it is a very nice product.
B002DYKPH4|4.0|Gave this as a gift all discs worked as described.The case and everything was in tact very very happy thanks.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Lots of fun . All of the kids love this game . Will be looking to get more bubble games in the future !!!
0316017930|4.0|The thing about Malcolm Gladwell is he makes his writing very transparent and easily readable. He could write very complicated stories and express them in an easy, understandable format. And this one, though not my favorite one of his works, creates an interesting insight in how we view the world.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Well done, very entertaining bit of history.  The characters are very well portrayed and believable.  Loved the costuming, have always been interested in costume design.  Did you know that King Henry V!!! was very vain about his legs?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read all of his books and most of them are amazing.  I wasn't sure if I would like this one, a continuation of &#34;The Shining&#34;, but it is really good!  Can't put it down.  He hasn't lost his writing skills - amazing!
1416955070|5.0|Words cannot describe this book. It is absolutely AMAZING! I read this book for the first time over 3 years ago, and I couln't put it down after I started it. I have read it over 100 times again. The characters are intriguing, there are love triangles EVERYWHERE, so it make for a intense, complicated, yet easy to follow plot. This book is definetley one of my favorites, and I would recommend it to ANYONE.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is a great CD.  Lots of great songs on this CD.  Sound quality is good and I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for a good Neil Young CD.
B005QJZ5FA|1.0|Unit was purchased as a used product however the item was damaged, the jewel case was broken and numerous songs were skipping. $7 paperweight at the moment...however, the negative review should not reflect on the music artist or recording company. The songs are great overall when I can get them to play...
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed the game but found it to be too short.  I was just getting into it when it was over.<br />I was also  glad to find a game without Hidden Objects.  More please....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was so impressed with the way Mr. King eased us into Danny's world after his winter at the Overlook.  Since I felt this book started off a little slowly I would give it 4 1/2 stars but that isn't offered so it has to be a 5.  Once things started holding my interest I was hooked and didn't want to put this book down.  I am a &#34;Constant Reader&#34; and was not disappointed with this most recent treat!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show, one of the very best shows ever made in television history. Would tell everone to watch. So if you havent watched this show, I suggest you do. Hooked from the beginning.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|My son loves this movie. He is 5 years old and has watched this movie 4 times already. Very cute
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come to the kindle for a while. Glad that it is finally here. Candy Crush will have you engaged for a while. Every level offers some new twist that will have you using all your lives in a matter of minutes, as you try to figure out the best way to clear the board. Fun game would recommend this to others.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was darker than the other two books in the series. In the earlier books, the main characters were brave even though they were scared. In this book, it seems like they became sensitive all of a sudden. At times the book was very descriptive (scenes when the war took place), but less descriptive when the other tributes were telling their tales or \\"secrets\\". Towards the end of the book, more details about the Capitol's ruling emerged. The book showed that while a new regime was trying to take the Capitol down, they were not above ruling in the same manner. I was happy with several of Katniss' final acts in the book. There's no fairy tale ending, but there never is when a world is at war.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I enjoyed this movie I watched it twice and read the book twice, in order to understand the story.  I now plan to see the remake.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This was the start of the great animated group. Great album from start to finnish! A must have in my collection!
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|This is a sequel of \\"The Shining\\", Dan Torrance son of Jack Torrance the Outlook hotel caretaker becomes and adult with a precognitive paranormal mind skill dubbed \\"The Shining\\", and the continuation of his life  originates a fantastic story<br /><br />SK forsakes classical horror, moving into the blurred world of the paranormal wonders<br /><br />The  first part of the book is riveting and the ending where all the action packed suspense takes place gets very complex, multilayered and full of surreal imagery<br /><br />Enjoyed the story line and the beginning of the book, but the ending was not satisfactory
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The only things you can use this for is Youtube, Netflix and Hulu, it would be amazing if I could pull up a web browser and put it on my computer. Also would like to be able to stream my online movies to a tv. Its a great idea but not adapted into real life yet.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I saw this movie a year ago with my mother, and recently shared it with a friend who was unable to find this movie in any local theater near her home, last year. The fact that the story is based on the true story of Verdi's real life story, makes the film even more charming. I applaud Dustin Hoffman for finding this story, and for taking the time to hire a fabulous cast to bring this worthwhile story to screen with exquisite grace. Everything about this film, the actors, the scenery, the pace, etc. is uplifting. A must-see film!
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|This movie is really so much fun.  It was the first movie my now 3 year old son saw in the theater.  He loves monsters and sat still through the whole movie.  He likes Disney movies enough but generally they don't hold his attention that well...except for Tinkerbell (which works out for older sis!) and this.  Cars and the like just don't keep him engaged for more than 30 minutes. I am going to surprise my kids with the DVD for this weeks movie night.  The story line works really well.  All the different monsters are fun for the kids and it's nice to see the start of Sully and Mike's relationship.  My daughter adores the girl monsters.  I knew this movie would be a must have for our weekly movie night rotation.
B008YMHORI|3.0|Helen Grimaud is a good concert piano player, not an excellent one. No surprises here. Here choices of music are interesting and  well thought out.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the twist at the end...you never know what path you'll end up with in life!<br />I'm looking forward to the sequel !
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great, funny and cute movie that i think would appeal to everyone in the family. We really enjoyed this movie. My daughter is even going as Mavis for halloween this year.
