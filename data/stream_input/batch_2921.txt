0415524415|5.0|In The Concept of Injustice, Professor Eric Heinze sets out to challenge a fundamental notion of Western programmatic justice theories - the binary opposition of justice and injustice. He traces back this notion to the beginning of Western philosophy which he attributes to Plato, who was the first person to give a systematic account of justice. He then follows this line of thought throughout philosophical history in a way which immediately gives him credibility with his vast Russelesque knowledge. He traces this mistake / idealism in Western thought through Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Erasmus, Aquinas, Rousseau, Marx, and others.<br /><br />Heinze argues that justice and injustice are not mutually exclusive opposites as their etymology and classical philosophical construction suggests, rather injustice is a product of justice, and it is created and perpetuated from regimes of justice. His thesis is expressed wonderfully when he says that Thrasymachus [injustice] is the shadow of Socrates [justice].<br /><br />The thesis presented by Heinze is such a one that will be quite damning to justice theories, he explains that if a justice theory is perfectly executed, it's author would expect a systemically just society to be produced, and they would blame injustices on a misapplication of their theory. However, Heinze's theory would suggest that the binary opposition fails when placed in a systemic context, though it can work in certain isolated and conventional senses. If this is the case, and he presents a very strong argument in its favour, it would seem the authors of justice theories would necessarily have to fully consider the injustice that the application of their theory produces and argue that it is comparatively the least unjust, rather than their theory being most conducive to justice (or prove Heinze wrong). Therefore, if this book is given the attention it deserves it could lead to a transformation of future justice theory, and revitalise the debate for existing theories.<br /><br />The thesis is split into 2 parts:<br /><br />First of all he considers the classical understandings of injustice. Heinze asserts that justice theories generally have two approaches, justice as unity and justice as measurement, and explains the traditional view of these approaches and how injustice is considered in binary opposition. In the second part of this book he looks to post-classical understandings where he spends time analysing Shakespeare and Corneille (among others) to show how unity and measurement theories produce injustice. Heinze's interpretations of these texts are convincing and in line with modern analysis (whilst also adding new scholarship to the texts). Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with these works of literature, because Heinze offers you a good account of the texts to allow you to follow his arguments, without this being a digression. The use of literature in this type of work may seem strange when there are a variety of other factual ways to express the argument, but it is justified by the way literature highlights the socio-legal background of societies, without being muddled and cloaked behind a large number of court cases and legislation. They provide the bare-bones of interaction and are insightful reflections of modern market-driven society that we can analyse. It also provides for a fun enterprise to consider genuine examples of how injustice is perpetuated by justice.<br /><br />The main thesis itself is not the only value of this book, but in making the argument it provides many ancillary points which are particularly interesting. I particularly enjoyed Heinze's discussions of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality which he used to suggest artificial constructions of justice and also the inevitability of human injustice.<br /><br />This book is one for the jurisprudent; it is rightly read by anyone interested in justice theory, and necessarily by anyone writing on the subject. Those interested in philosophy and/or literature will find value in this book as well. It will also be useful to anyone doing research in any of these areas with good analysis of a number of different writers. Anyone studying Aristotle, Plato, Rousseau, Shakespeare or Corneille is strongly advised to read the book as these writers being given a lot of attention.<br /><br />Finally the book is presented wonderfully with a comprehensive bibliography and footnoting style. It also looks beautiful on the bookshelf with a wonderful painting on the cover by Luca Giordano which received a lot of curious glances when I was reading it on the train.

B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I didn't make it to Cloud Atlas when it was in the theatres and hoped that once I saw it on DVD that it would be a revelation, an under-appreciated gem that everyone should have seen. I was wrong. The special effects are good, the actors do a good job, but what is missing is a constancy, a thread that binds the story together. The jumping around is distracting and even after an hour, you cannot really get into it. When a story is told, especially by the medium of film, we must be gripped by a character or an element that holds our interest and makes us want to pursue the telling from beginning to end. Alas, there are no gripping characters--only incomplete ones, in whom we don't have time to become interested because we've jumped somewhere else. Perhaps the filmmakers missed a great opportunity by not hiring Steve Kloves (he wrote most if not all of the Harry Potter films), who, through skillful manipulation of just a few critical elements made J K Rowling's stories work visually.<br /><br />A movie is not a book and has entirely different structural requirements.While it's a bit easier to leaf back and forth between chapters to understand what's in a book, how many viewers would have the patience to keep re-running film segments in order to figure them out? Two hours into it, I still had trouble understanding where this film was going. I have not read the book, though I am now curious to do so. And by the way, I don't think a viewer is obliged to read the book in order to understand this particular film, or any other. As a fan of science fiction I badly wanted to love this movie, but unfortunately, despite the grand visuals and some nice acting, it fails where it counts most: holding the viewer's interest. I was hoping to learn this film was a future classic, but instead found a movie bomb for the ages. Sadly, despite the expensive sets, decent CGI, and an A-list cast, I can give it only one star.t counts most: holding the viewer's interest.

B00F35B8F8|4.0|No matter what they do I'll always be a Trek fan, good entertainment and I really like the cast, special effects and the booming sound track.  The story line was pretty good until we found out who the villain was, I won't say here to avoid a spoiler alert.  They tried to tie in an original Shatner TV episode with an original movie theme and it became confusing.  I like it when they do something that ties in with past episodes that make sense but when they don't, well, it diminishes the illusion of why we're at the movie to begin with.  I hate being slapped with reality when immersed in fantasy.  I rate a movie based on whether or not I would buy it or want to see it again.  I do not want to do either with this film.

B000PEX1IE|5.0|I gotta say, can you get any better than ghostbusters 1? It's something nobody attempted at the time and these guys really pulled it off. It's one of my favorite comedy horrors and it made my top three comedy horrors. It's got good adult humor the whole family can enjoy. It's truly a timeless classic. Bill Murray, Ghosts, a 100 foot marshmallow man, demigods, and a barrel of laughs. It's a movie that will make anyone who hasn't seen it a fan of if you like the type.

B00CUKTGNU|5.0|I sort of forgot about Franz Ferdinand for a while. Then one night I had a dream that their new album came out and it was sonically infested with maggots through a freak recording accident. In the dream I was too nauseous to buy the cd, but in the waking world I decided that sonic maggots were a really cool concept, and was then inspired purchase the album. It was an inspiration that worked out pretty well. I like \\"Right thoughts, Right Words, Right Action\\" a lot, and I am happy to report that there are no sound fly larvae in it.<br /><br />Anyway. The album reminded me a lot of their first , because it has that sharp, possibly cheesy in a good way, dancey sort of sound. Some people like this and some people don't. If you're not sure, you always can listen to most of the songs on this album through their youtube account first.<br /><br />If you're established in your Franz Ferdinand liking, you will probably like this album. The deluxe edition is worth getting as well, because it only costs a little more and has lots of extra stuff. The live recordings added a good energy. I really liked the version of \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" it included also.<br /><br />The maggots led me down the right path. Cool.
B007R41E8O|3.0|I loved this game. The graphics are cool, the music set a perfect mood, the story line was intriguing; I loved the surprise ending.  The game was challenging enough to be lots of fun for about three days.  I very much wanted to do a 5 star review... but two things stopped me.<br /><br />The two main reasons I downgraded my rating to 3 stars: Every time I left the game and came back to play more, I'd get a nag screen about leaving a 5 star review. NOT cool. Minus half a star for the nagging. I normally leave reviews only after I finish a game... not when I'm in the middle of playing one, and certanly not from my Kindle Fire, on which web surfing is very much like wading through thick mud... way too slow to suit me. Dump the nag screen, Alawar, and you might have gotten a 5 star review... but then there's that other thing.<br /><br />At least three times daily, or about 10 to 12 times in all, the game stalled and took me back to the main menu. The game stalling and restarting itself happened far too often.  Very much NOT cool. Especially those two times where I went back into the game to find myself one or two steps back from where I had been when the game stalled. Making me play over parts of the game I'd already finished was not too nice. Minus a full star for the stalling and starting over.<br /><br />Bottom line: It was worth 99 Amazon coins - barely. For casual playing, I'd recommend this game, (I would have given 3.5 stars if that option was available). I can only recommend the game to those who can put up with the stalls and delays while the game reboots itself; not to mention those nag screens that practically begged for a 5 star review. If you have little or no patience, then this game - at least in the current state - isn't for you.

B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I thought it was really good.  I just think most people didn't get it.  Nice to see a movie without all the cursing and sex that most movies have today. Both Will and Jaden were good and it was well done.  It's not about alien slaying and horror.  It's about a son's relationship with his father, growing up, and learning self control.  Good Movie I say.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun. I IS like subway surfers but wayyyyyyyyyy cooler. I would totally get get this game!!
B00CSYRHG6|3.0|I will say up front that I do like this movie.  Interesting character backgrounds, looks lovely on Blu-Ray, and nice slice of life set during high school.  Even the English dub wasn't terrible, not great but better than Ponyo.  How ever if you are looking for a more true-to-the-orginal script subtitles this is not going to be your movie.  Many of the names are wrong between what is spoken and what is on the screen, some of the more \\"adult\\" words like whiskey are completely ignored for lines that don't make much sense in context to what is being shown.<br /><br />I like the movie, the dub script was about what was to be expected but I expected a better more true subtitle script.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Ya who doesn't luv the minions right! Fast pace. Hard for young ones. They get very frustrated. &amp; with the horrendous long wait between tries its hard to stay interested. Development please shorten the reloads!?

B00G7QPXUI|2.0|Woody Allen's misguided dramedy feels painfully familiar - right down to the title character. &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; (2013) finds the writer-director in Tennessee Williams mode with Cate Blanchett trying too hard to win another Oscar. Except for Andrew Dice Clay, the ensemble members are poorly utilized. Worst of all, Allen shows no interest in San Francisco's cultural landscape - hence the endless flashbacks to his New York comfort zone. Unlike &#34;Midnight in Paris&#34; (2011) and &#34;Match Point&#34; (2005), Woody never seems engaged with the material. Plot and character details simply fall by the wayside. As a result, &#34;Blue Jasmine&#34; emerges as a sloppy late-period work - unworthy of its critical hyperbole.

Fast read, in the can't-put-it-down way...good bed time story...leaves much to the imagination but ends in a way to where my expectations were fulfilled and a little mystery to chew on in the next few days...recommends to any Neil gaiman fan, anyone looking for a bedtime story, or a good mysterious thinker book

B00AQ71FLK|3.0|A lot of learning curves and playing times to be sufficient . Equipping a character is confusing and challenging. It takes forever for a character's level to go up. This is not a mission type of game. It's a boring game when you play 3 online maps
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This movie is a forgotten gem of the early 1990s before unclassified documents before alien autopsies before any of the great conspiracies was the conspiracy theory of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy our president. This movie is long but it is great pairing Kevin Costner Alongside TV favorites like Laurie Metcalf and Newman from Seinfeld all of which deliver outstanding unrecognizable performances when compared to their TV characters this movie directed by Oliver Stone really convince me that there were three shooters it is in possible that Lee Harvey Oswald got off three shots in six circuits from the book depository the magic bullet theory is explored and demonstrated to be impossible I love this movie

I don't know why they are not more mainstream, but then again, not everyone likes this type of r&b.  I have everything Susan has ever done.  She touches my soul, my mind and my being.  I am 68 years young, raised with Motown, and this is as good as it gets for me right now.<br />Their last album was fabulous to.  I dance every time I put it on.

B00AZRBLHO|3.0|The idea behind this book is great: take a dry process management concept and present it as a story. Since this is the premise behind the book we can forgive the superficial characters and plot points. But the ending is so loaded with name dropping and contrived resolutions that it endangers the believability of what's already been presented.  Bad guys magically disappear, good guys magically rewarded, etc.  Note to authors: if you get a chance to revise, completely rewrite the ending. Your credibility will thank you

B008D36INE|1.0|I was looking for a romantic movie. This film was slow, silent, and without any uplifting message. The leading lady had everything going for her: youth, good looks, wealth, and education. She managed to alienate everyone who came in contact with her. She insulted her husband, her mother in law, and eventually, her lover. All of her affected angst was in a search to live with \\"passion.\\"  She mistook lack of self control and unconscionable rudeness for passion. She began miserable, made everyone around her miserable, and ended miserable. The film was virtually silent, as if it were a stage play. There was almost no background score to move the scenes along. It was a waste of my time, and really brought me down.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I really like this game it mixes rpg and SIM together and comes out well. The only reason I only gave this four stars is because their are a lot of glitches. U cant open guild hq 99percent of the time and friending people doesn't always work. Please fix this programmers it would be awesome .
B00DRGQZRG|5.0|Gosh, I do miss the \\"fusion\\" powerhouses of the 1970s. This is not a copy, but a wonderfully updated version of that spirit. If you added an electric violin to the mix, you'd think you were listening to a reunion of the Mahavishnu Orchestra's first incarnation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well enough. Needs more compatible apps, which I am sure will come with time. Though I understand why, it's sad I also have to plug it in separately for power. I have recommended to various friends who are also enjoying.
B002O2THVA|1.0|Although I had not seen the movie for 30+ years, I recalled more interesting, subtle action than is actually present.  Perhaps an 8-year old would still appreciate the dramatic aspects while enjoying the slap-stick caricatures.
B005VSRFEA|4.0|The book honestly didn't make me think much differently about the world, as I hoped it would. That being said, Meadows put lots of thought into her theory and provided great illustrations as a supplement to her ideas.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This is a short, simple, but polished game. In each level you draw lines on the screen to direct sugar into a cup. And that's it. Well, there are a few wrinkles along the way (multiple cups, sugar that you color by directing it through a filter, reversible gravity), but the basic goal is the same. There's no score, no time limit, no achievements or collectibles: you either get enough grains of sugar in the cup or you don't, and if you do, there's no reason to play that level ever again. A great deal of the challenge comes from drawing the lines you mean to draw; the mapping is exact enough that the slightest tremor will produce an unintended curve or zigzag. Aside from that, the early levels are pretty easy; I did the first 13 out of 35 in about 20 minutes. The rest may be a bit harder, but that's still not a lot to do even by 99-cent app standards. What there is is charmingly designed, though, with catchy music, suitably understated but sharp graphics, and a blessed lack of ads and other promotional content. If you put a high value on quantity of content, SUGAR, SUGAR probably isn't worth it, but if all you want for your 99 cents is an hour or two of fun, you could do a lot worse.<br /><br />Update (September 17, 2013): I've continued to play this game, which is more than I can say for some free apps of the day. I've finished level 23, and it's stayed reasonably fun, but the levels still aren't all that challenging as puzzles. They're more a test of fine motor skills than of mental acuity. Extend a line a millimeter too far or add the barest curve, and things will come to a standstill. There ~is~ more need during later levels for quick addition of lines in mid-game, which is more challenging, but also allows more room for those frustrating errors. These quirks make me feel better about the slim level count; this isn't a design that can sustain fun over hundreds of levels. But, as the title of my review suggests, it's good enough while it lasts.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Awesome movie and great deal when you get 3 formats plus the digital copy.  Love the new Star Trek movies!
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|Retaliation probably won't win any academy awards except maybe in the stunt and special effects department, but it was a fun and exciting ride.
030758836X|3.0|I don't get it.  65 weeks on the list?  It's well written with an interesting turn of events but I could certainly &#34;put it down&#34; at any given point.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|It all started with hearing &#34;Overjoyed&#34; and then &#34;Haunt&#34; from their demo...Pompeii of course is catchy and history-based which is so fun...Dan Smith's voice is absolutely phenominal and the rest of the lads in this band harmonize beautifully with him. This band is a treasure!!!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This is a relatively small kit,  but has provided hours of entertainment.  Much like the video/computer game, kids can build and rebuild and can configure a multitude of modules.  I did find this item to be a bit costly for the size, but in terms of entertainment value, it was worth the price.
B0063IH60K|5.0|keeps me busy while watching Tv..better this than smacking.  I can take my kindle anywhere and play this while traveling.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Love love love me some Dexter! Would recommend to anyone and everyone. Best show ever. Love it love it love it.
0739359320|5.0|In my opinion this reader is great..  This book is a keeper.  Grabs you til the end.<br /><br />Nice Purchase.  Highly recommended
B002JXK5VU|3.0|This show is quirky and fun. It's kind of sci-fi, mystery, and a bit comedic. There are better things to watch but this isn't exactly  a waste of time, however. Not everyone will like it. Watch a couple of episodes. It may grow on you.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Decent movie.  Too many last minute life-saving scenarios for me.  Despite being predictable, it was action packed and moves quickly.  The Spock storyline continues to be the most interesting part of the Star Trek saga.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was super funny. I just finished reading it the third time. Totally worth the money . I  would get if  I were you
0718157834|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but I am in love with this book!  Louisa and Will are such unique characters... I can't wait to see what happens!
B008469DGY|4.0|I love this game. It looks and controls great. Once you get the little nuances in controlling the ball you can't stop playing. Works great on Kindle Fire.
B00005NKKV|5.0|perfect condition and perfect music on the cd. thank you so much for letting me buy this from you. it was everything i expected and more.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Great show. Took 2 weeks and watched through its entirety. I was definitely feeling lost after the last episode of the last season.
B00CRS5HII|4.0|Just found out recently that Albums could be downloaded form Amazon.  I will surely check Amazon and compare costs to Itunes before making buying decision.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This is a very good game esp for faotd but becareful how you draw your lines because the sugar could easilyget stuck, but with a little thought each level can be easily won
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a really good game the graphics are excellent. also the minions. are so cute the difficulty. its awesome. its really minion
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great product! Use it on my Android tablet! Mostly for library books which are free. Would definitely recommend this app.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I first found about this game when I watches jackfrostminer played it. And when I tried it out I loved it! Now I am sad I cant play it without being disconnected because I have bad connection these days. also check out jackfrostminer!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|All around great three stories brought together excellently at the end<br />Only critical note the character Cecilia was somewhat unbelievalely too stepford wife<br />My favorite was Rachel
1465408746|4.0|I can't say enough good things about the Star Wars: Incredible Cross Section books. Its a perfect gift for any big sci-fi fan or one of the scientific/engineering mindset. Some of the specific bad things about this edition is that not a whole of new stuff is added. There may be three new cross sections, but there is not a whole lot provided in the way of new information about those vehicles. They changed the format around and put the awesome technical information in the back of the book. Lastly, to its detriment they removed or changed information from previous editions, so its better to buy [[ASIN:0756627044 Star Wars Complete Cross-Sections: The Spacecraft and Vehicles of the Entire Star Wars Saga]].<br /><br />Overall this book tries to bring some sense of reason, common sense and science into the Star Wars universe, but without impeding on the great sci-fi/fantasy setting. Its a great shame other Star Wars works do not follow this example and instead go down the path of \\"its a space opera\\" numbers/common sense/science don't matter at all. I hope the grand scale and wonder of the original trilogy is again captured in Episode VII.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this when I travel for my wake up calls instead of a call from the service desk makes me feel safer.
B004V9MU86|4.0|Great to have a version of some German people who didn't capitulate to the nazis, as much as they could.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Well this is not one of those times, I guess the movie was alright. It has action and somewhat of a plot and a lot of celebrity walk-ons.
B003B02O14|5.0|I've just started to read John Grisham's books and I can't put them down. Can' t wait to read Playing For Pizza!
B00006WUWQ|3.0|Great trilogy! I really enjoyed all three of them. Mike Myers is a genius. It's a classic movie. Enjoy It
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Bad acting and terribly screenplay.  You want to keep the audience guessing a little about, but everything????  Who are the magicians, what are they doing, and for whom are they doing it?  Keep the last thing separate, but everything else needs improvement.  Don't waste your money.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|I was looking for a movie to watch with my 14 yr old and this one was perfect. He didn't remember the first time we watched it and it is a great family movie with older kids
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the whole  damn thing!! Read the entire book in 3 days!!! Couldn't put it down .Men like that don't exist!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I have missed her since her surgery but boy it is sooo nice to hear her singing again. I can't wait till the new cd comes out in November!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|First, for me the movie was consistent with the first one from 2009, a fantastic re-imagining of the original Star Trek universe. Great editing (no slow or boring moments), great sense of detail, great casting (Chris Pine is a great Kirk), and a terrific \\"bad guy\\". I love the redo of the classic Khan case. Film gets a five star review from me, but not the packaging.<br />I am very very disappointed with the packaging. EVERY edition, whether Blu Ray, HD, or whatever, should offer the same extras, but not this time. I agree with those above who were likewise disappointed and angry about this. But whether to boycott the dvd? Not going to make a difference. IF people stop buying them, they'll only have streaming, plus dvd's are so cheap to produce, they won't care if some fail to buy them. I bought it because it's a film I will watch over and over as part of my overall Sci Fi collection. So follow your gut on how to proceed.
B004FWPK8G|5.0|it was a good laugh from beginning to end. in this case old did not mean out of date for sure
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob was a mesmerizing read with a ending that surprised.  The quality of the writing was excellent.  I am recommending this book to many.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES AND WISH THEY WOULD BRING IT BACK - JUST WENT YOU GET INTO IT THERE ARE NO MORE EPISODES
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a well written book with easy to follow experiments that will blast all preconceived notions of thinking and the way we live our lives out of the water! If you have ever wanted to change your life this is the book for you!
B004P7CNE0|5.0|I have seen this movie a while back somewhere at my friends house and did not know what it was called. Years later I found it here on Amazon and just had to have it for my small dvd collection.<br />The story is well though out and some what emotional. I hate movies that have no thinking behind it. This is not that kind of movie. You might have to watch it two or tree times to get everything. Lots of action with a pistol, and rifles. They even have a nice scene of some sword fighting that I thought was great.<br />Most of all I think this movie shows what our world might become if we try too hard to be politically correct.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book is wonderful.  I read the book in two days and the ending many.  Do not read the ending in a public place.  I give the book 5 stars!
B001HN6922|5.0|Bought this for my two year old son. He loved the first one and loved this one even more. There is an interesting story for the grown ups that end up watching it along with the kids. Kids love the action, the colors and the characters. Cars 2 was well put together, the world is so realistic sometimes you think your watching a movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is more than good, it's amazing. Author is really good. Love these books. Would recommend to all of my friends.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|it is a great app keep me interested when needed but I would like for it to give me more energy
B008JFUPK8|3.0|This review is based on seeing the film (last night) in the theater and does not review or rate the DVD and/or Blu-ray or other digital release.<br /><br />MOS isn't the worst superhero film I've ever seen, but it is something of a disappointment. It actually has a lot of the same issues that Superman Returns had--that is, what to keep from the comics and the Reeves films vs. what to do differently, plus story bloat.<br /><br />The choices that get put up on the screen in MOS leave me shaking my head. There were so many things done well and yet so many things aggravatingly awful. I think where it really goes wrong is in what is supposed to be the exciting climax vs. Zod.<br /><br />I like Henry Cavill as Supes, but I think he would make an even better Wolverine. Brandon Routh looked better as Superman in SR's version of the updated tights, in my opinion. Cavill looks more like the guy from Twilight or something in a sculpted body suit (which he doesn't need because his body is so sculpted anyway).<br /><br />I'll give this a slight edge over Superman Returns. I thought SR had more satisfying moments and was more visually interesting in terms of giving us the world in which Superman is supposed to exist. But the homage to the first two SM films got tiring, and Lex Luthor as the ultimate villain is too under-motivated to take up so much film time. They should have spent more time with BR as CK and/or SM. And they should have made much more of his trip back to Krypton (stuff that was basically cut from the release).<br /><br />I know many fans will say MOS is more original--because it doesn't draw on the first two Reeve films at all. But visually it seems to recycle a lot of ideas from Dune, Aliens, Spielberg's War of the Worlds, Avatar, even Transformers (and that is not good), etc. The depiction of US military forces doing their thing, done to death in how many films anyway, is just tedious.<br /><br />I realize that films like SR and MOS are really huge collaborations, but as with the recent ST films, perhaps the producers and directors are bringing in TOO MANY different pieces and visual coherence suffers. It was supposed to be a more 'realistic' Superman, but instead what I saw was this very jarring shift from an intergalactic civilization (that would belong in Green Lantern) to a world that looked like it was filmed more cheaply than Smallville and then to a world that gets destroyed (seriously did Metropolis really look like a real city to anyone, even before it got levelled?).<br /><br />There just was no really believable social realism to the film (something for example Spielberg got so right in the first hour of War of the Worlds). It did look like he was walking around as a fugitive in the landscape where they filmed the last X-files film.<br /><br />Another strike against originality is just how much this film draws on Superman Returns--the use of flashbacks to childhood, holographic projections of the dead father, Christ-like imagery in presenting SM--and even in the climactic action of doing something really titanic and confusing with something going on in the ocean that was titanic and confusing, while his powers are being zapped.<br /><br />And then there is the implausibility of the story once you accept the fantasy reality scenario that is given you--basically the destruction of Krypton. I guess the writers (including Nolan?) subscribe to some sort of theory about civilization collapses, but why Krypton would need Earth and why it couldn't survive in all its previous colonies is beyond me.<br /><br />Might have worked better had they done a parallel story of two Kryptonians--Supes and Zod. A sort of Abel and Cain story or something?
B002GIBVWA|4.0|Good cool I loved it the movie was great my girl friend loved it I love girls how about you
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Best and most important documentary of the last 2 decades.<br /><br />I have a problem with the movie's obsession with the lifestyles of Wall Street bankers, but it's indictment of their power and greed is as searing as it is true.
B00BHMEALA|2.0|It was like watching paint dry!  And I like Ben Affleck. Plot seemed sporadic, characters were not fully developed, hard to remain interested. I really feel like I threw away the money I paid for this movie. I purchased after a glowing recommendation from a co worker (not a good call).
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This book is considered by many to be one of the \\"must read\\" classics and it is easy to see why.  I read it cover to cover in one sitting and was completely engaged.  As to its overall premise... I just don't know...It is fascinating, terrifying, and heartbreaking all at once.  Regardless, it will make you think.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|There was a good chance for this movie to succeed but the terrible acting sunk it.<br /><br />We stopped it after 12 minutes and watched cable instead.<br /><br />I should've researched this better as I am not a fan of anything that's Morgan Freeman has been in since Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />Give this stinker a pass.
B000YDE46Y|5.0|The boot fits large, but it feel perfect to me.  I do not hike in these boot, but if I did, I would probably order the 10ish as the best fit in these boots is 1/2 size smaller than your regular size.  I like wearing 1/2 larger shoes, always have.
0061537969|5.0|I'm no racing fan, so at first I wasn't interested in the book because of the title.  I'm so glad that I read it, I LOVED it.<br />The story is just incredible.  This is a book about the people as seen through the eyes of the dog.  The story has a great plot, it has twists and makes you want to keep reading to find out what will happen next.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of the things the dog would do  especially why he did them.  This book had me laughing, crying and not wanting to put it down.  I finished it and kept thinking about it all night.  I don't write many reviews, but this one deserves the five stars and then some.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|I watched this movie in the theather and it real puts life, friendships, and bonds into perspective.  Great movie, but I have yet to open and watch at home.  I am waiting for the right tv, surrounding sound set up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun... the puzzles were entertaining. Just wish there were more. I'll be  anxiously awaiting new puzzles.  Hope I don't have to wait too long.

B00AF6B22E|2.0|I should have done a much better job of researching this video before purchase.  I only watched a few minutes of this movie before stopping it because of the full body nudity and the F-Bombs thrown out there right from the get-go.  I couldn't watch another minute of it with the possibility that it could go on like that.  So, I have no idea if the story and acting were good or not.<br />  When I purchased this movie, I was going off of what I saw in the trailers, which made it look inviting and interesting.  I sure miss Clean Flix.
0062225715|3.0|Mort. Let's see here. Ever seen Death drunk? Ever thought about being Death as a job? You know, with the house and the schedule and an apprentice, and even office politics? No? Well then, you're in for a treat. I did laugh to the point of aches in my belly while reading the first 3 Discworld books, like, literally, on every page. I didn't quite laugh as hard while reading this one, but still, every scene with Death is a treasure in of itself, not mentioning the hysterical setup of the entire idea about life, death, universe, reality, essence, non essence, rouge elephants attempting to trample royal wedding guests... err, excuse me, I'm getting carried away. Anyway. An awesome read, but I'll be frank, in a couple of places it was slow and I was almost, ALMOST, tempted to put it down. As to the story...<br /><br />A gangly and overall awkward teenager is supposed to find a job, or an apprenticeship, or something of the sort, sort of because he's not really good at anything and is thinking too much, and sort of because his dad is sort of trying to get rid of him that way. It's never stated openly, only implied. Incidentally, the last at the job fair, he, the lad, that is, Mort, lands an apprenticeship with Death. Charming, eh? Add scornful stern princesses that die or don't die or they can't figure out if they die or not die to the mix, Death's horse called Binky, and Death's daughter (what, you didn't think Death could have a daughter?) Ysabell, oh, and a bunch of wizards doing, well, I can't tell you what they were doing without spoiling it for you, and a slew of other completely unrelated events, which only Terry could pull off, by throwing them in seemingly at random but always somehow managing to tie loose ends, and you've got yourself quite a story. May I add, in the course of it everything turns upside down, with Mort quite interested in understanding what's it like to be dead, and Death quite interested in understanding what's it like to be alive and human. Oh, and they both can walk through walls, for no reason. There, I'm off to read book 5 now (in the order they were published, mind you), called Sourcery.and they both can walk through walls, for no reason.

B007THA4FI|5.0|J. K. Rowling creates a compelling story with unique characters and intricate plot.  You will have a hard time putting this story down.  Adults will now be the beneficiaries of Rowling's talent as a writer.  I will be watching for the next book!

B008MM9630|5.0|Addictive! I used to be an avid farmville player..this app is way better imo and I love how you do not have to have a gazillion friends or be dependent on them for help in app. I would love to see more animals in the market....and a few more affordable items that spawn crystals since they are somewhat hard to come by. GREAT game! If you like farmville or frontierville you will love this app..it's a nice mix of them both.
B00EF460ME|1.0|After I purchased the app it told me it is not compatible with my kindle fire HD.I would have liked to know that sooner.maybe before I wasted my money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show. It's a simple yet beautifully done drama. I only wish there were more episodes I watched it quite quickly.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Fascinating premise wasted on a weak, trite, predictable plotline.<br /><br />Expensive CGI rendered for so-what situations, and not well executed either.<br /><br />And the cast. Boy howdy did they phone it in. Mark Ruffalo looked bloated and bored, and yawned his way through some of the most cliche dialogue I've heard lately. Michael Caine botched it. The B-listers had nothing to work with. Morgan Freeman should never have signed on for this schlock. Jesse Eisenberg always mumbles and trips his way through his dialogue so no surprise there.<br /><br />If you want a movie like Ocean's Eleven, rewatch Ocean's Eleven.<br /><br />Pardon me while i go back through these reviews and try to figure out what everyone liked about this thing.
B003F29D44|5.0|Awesome movie! I had never watched this movie, but a friend recommended it to me. It was great. I enjoyed watching it online through Amazon.
B000NMW6M0|1.0|An all-star cast and a &#34;renowned&#34; director don't equal a good movie. Also, just because the movie has subtitles doesn't mean it's urbane. Ultimately, this movie might be even more boring and convoluted than Crash is. There is no real plot development and I couldn't care less about the characters as the director jumps from depressing story to depressing story. I don't often review movies, especially those I don't like so I think that says something about this one.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoyed it enough that I will probably read the series after I get caught up on my other books I have. I always enjoy following a particular series about the same character. At times, what Reacher accomplishes seems a little beyond belief but on the whole he is entertaining.

B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Every straight man goes through his life wondering, on occasion, whether he may have any latent homosexuality in him. A moment may pass where he may doubt his manhood. He may see a scene in a movie and wonder if he could ever be attracted to a man. Well, after seeing about 30 minutes of The Great Gatsby, I knew for certain I am 100% straight, because this is the queerest picture ever made. In the worst way possible. This is the movie that proves that for every ultra-talented gay person, there's Baz Luhrmann's toilet taste, an aesthetic made for $2 tranny shows. There is nothing at all about this film that strikes the right note - it's revolting throughout in every possible way. The casting is absurd, the script pretentious and stupid, and the direction, well, let's create a category called Cowpie. I should have spent the money on lottery tickets.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|At last, after a summer of movies that are little more than a series of explosions, a real story.  I did not see the ending coming but when it hit, it was perfect.<br /><br />Thoughtful, actually raises an idea or two.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I did not like the book.The whole book was very unrealistic and the story was very weird and did not make any sense..
B000VOC90Y|1.0|I bought my previous Swiss Gear backpack more than 10 years ago, and have used it practically every day since then. I have not been gentle at any time, and after 10+ years of flawless service, a failing zipper finally prompted me to look for a replacement. I do not know where the old bag was made, but he new Ibex 17&#34; that arrived yesterday, to my dismay, is made in China.  I would not have needed the label to tell me, because the obnoxious plastic smell already made that clear. I have little hope the new bag will last as long as the previous one, and I am considering returning it. It just doesn't feel right to advertise a product under a &#34;Swiss Army&#34; brand label (which implies quality beyond any trace of doubt) without also disclosing to potential buyers that the product is not manufactured from genuine / high-quality materials one would expect from a product with that brand label. I admit that I am biased against &#34;made in China&#34; - but my point is that if the product would have been described as &#34;Made in China&#34; on the web site, I would not have bought it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Full of twists and turns, as all of his books do it comes together in the end.  While not at all a political book, and I do not know enough of the history to know it's accuracy, his writing opens the door of an Afghanistan and Muslim culture that is filled with love, faith and kindness, a reality that hopefully those who feel otherwise can begin to understand.
B00A2FSSHK|4.0|Good movie with a futuristic view. It's a bit obvious in spots but its entertaining. If you like Tom Cruise you will like this movie.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I thought it was pretty fun but in creative mode you can't use dynamite and other than that it was pretty fun except the price!!!!!!!it needs an update
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have been told about the show many times by my family. It wasn't until recently I found myself with time on my hands.  I just love the series.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|So the basic story we all read as kids is there but still very different. I'm not a fan of Kristen Stewart so I didn't really want to watch it but I was very surprised how much I liked it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Most satisfied with easy performance of this little APP. No comparison to other cleaning apps I've used. And it's task is completed in no time.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It's a USB code, not sure what exactly I can say about it. I do like how long it is which makes it easy to transfer stuff
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Outstanding purchase!  I simply love it.  All of the seasons plus added features along with the movies.  I great value, and I can watch anytime I want.  Thank you.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I'm not going to try to write a better or more detailed review than others that you will see here. I think they've said it better than I can or will.<br />First of all, let's keep this in perspective: I'm a mature woman (over 50), business professional and a martial artist - and I'm going back for an eleventh viewing tomorrow. (Ever watch a movie for the umpteenth time, knowing that once you get through the 'boring' part, you'll get back to the good stuff? Pacific Rim doesn't have a boring part you have to 'get through'; it contains only 'good stuff.')<br />What I can say is that this movie is beyond fantastic. It's brilliant. It's uplifting. It shows people at their best, rather than at their worst; it shows humanity at its best as well.<br />Is it flawless? No - but the flaws are minor and don't take anything away from the movie as a whole.<br />What truly makes this movie isn't the acting, the Jaegers, the kaiju or any other single aspect, but rather the absolute love of Guillermo del Toro for the genre; it shows in every detail. Watch for scenes like the flawless transition from Mako's transition from inside Gipsy Danger to entering her memory; the entire 'little Mako' scenario - it's terrifying!; the details like the rain bouncing off Gipsy Danger when she punches her fist after leaving the base in Alaska on the first mission of the film; Tendo's 'tap out' after the final battle; watch the incredible body mechanics that are captured in the motion of Striker Eureka's run in Hong Kong Bay (and in the fight in Sydney - and this is a scene that takes only a few seconds!), the motion of Gipsy as she recaptures her balance after being thrown onto the dock, Gipsy as she carries the oil tanker, and again, her body mechanics as she accelerates to run after the kaiju in Hong Kong. In most CGI, the 'weight' of the body is lost in the motion; here, it's captured beautifully - and for these little scenes alone, the movie is unparalleled. Add to this the great music (listento the changes as the scenes in Hong Kong Bay shift from Crimson Typhoon to Cherno Alpha), the absolute refusal of Travis Beacham to yield to the typical cliches you expect in these movies, and you end up with a movie that is, as far as I am concerned, possibly the best movie ever.<br />Really.<br />No hyperbole.<br />Best.<br />Movie.<br />Ever.
B00005V7CT|5.0|...and worth six!  What a great story!  The casting and production details couldn't be done better.  There are some really big names in this one, and together they really spin an hilarious (but somewhat sad) yarn.
0321701763|5.0|Very goog learning tool for those new to photoshop. The lessons on the DVD are well planned and easy to follow.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Makes it so easy to always have a book with you without having to carry a seperate device. Love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's an infuriatingly fun game that just works. It's reliable and doesn't freeze up. The puzzles are good, the appropriate combination of hard and easy. Highly commendable job, and it's free!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|When I saw this first movie, I thought qué Batman was reborn from ashes... the new concept by Nolan is powerful and critical. I believed in Nolan...
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I loved all three. I watch them two, three times a week. words can not express my pleasure while watching them
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The second parts aren't good than first BUT Nolan change absolutely this way.<br />When I knew the nemesis of Batman, I have a huge expectations  and The Joker exceed all ... this movie is powerful and change the ways to make madness on Gotham City...<br />I believed in Harvey Dent
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Anne's first 3 Vampire Chronicles are timeless. I read these in high school and I felt loke rereading them now at 26 y/o. Still such a great fantasy. Love you Anne!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I wanted to see this film because I have see all of Leo's. I was surprised his appearance was more of a cameo. Never saw one where he was not  the lead. It was a good flick however and I enjoyed it.
B00F1BFRA6|5.0|Cannot wait for season 4,I just love this series.  The writing and the actors are superb. I hope it continues for some time and would love if they eventually do a prequel.
B004132HZS|5.0|I honestly can't say enough good things about it, so I'll just leave it at this. If you love Sherlock Holmes, PLEASE do yourself a favor and watch series 1 and 2 immediately. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are absolutely incredible in their roles, as well as many of the supporting characters - Andrew Scott and Lara Pulver jump immediately to mind. Just buy it. You'll thank me later.
B003W0BYQ4|5.0|Great movie!  One of my favorite John Wayne movies. Could watch it over and over and not be the least bit bored.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a forever fan of Hugh Howey. I'll be dreaming of Wool worlds for years to come. BRAVO!!!  Thank you, Hugh.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|This story is a view of the common people of England through the major events of history. You should be quite familiar with the real political history of England in order to follow this story line. If you have this background, I would recommend this book as an interesting way to spend your time.
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|Excellent product worked well, really recommend is a good product an unbeatable price, I am happy for this purchase, if needed would buy same product
B008LV8TSU|5.0|A highly recommended read, perfect for children or adults. It is even better than the movie which inspired me to read it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very functional and easy to understand! Nice visuals and it does a good job of letting you know how much time you have left.<br /><br />+++++
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This album is amazing. This is a really great album to listen to in the car blasted on a subwoofer. Trent took a more electronic approach on this album than on previous albums. I prefer this style more personally,  but I could see how people would be turned off. I suggest people with an open mind and taste in different genres give this album a try. My favorite tracks are Find my way,  satellite, and various methods of escape. I wasn't a big fan of Everything. That is probably the only \\"bad\\" song on the album.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|all kinds of pop ups and ad like redirections started appearing. I really liked the church bells sound, would try it again and even pay if I knew it didn't put junk on my device. I have a Kindle Fire HD and it seemed unstable after install, cleared up when I removed it.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I love the TV show Castle and reading the books they refer to in the TV Show is quite interesting.  The book does stand alone without the show, but I know whenever I read a Richard Castle book it makes me want to watch reruns to see if anything in the book was mentioned in the show.<br /><br />Great marketing idea to have a TV Show showcase a mystery novelist.  Who is Richard Castle??? This is a mystery and makes it all the more interesting ....
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I discovered Jake Bugg in a telelvised Glastonbury Festival 2013.  I was stunned at his talent and sensitivity and wondered how a man of 19 can possess so much talent and life-insight.<br />I have since purchased this album that is full of very pleasing songs that truly entertain and move you.  I pray he is a glimpse of popular music's future because right now it has reached the lowest point in a century!<br /><br />His guitar playing is amazing and if you enjoy pure clean guitar sounds, buy this album.  In the song \\"TROUBLE TOWN\\" an example of his voice control, listen carefully at how he caresses the word \\"soon\\" at the end of the following lines:<br /> \\"Sitting on the pavement<br /> Boy you've missed your payment<br /> And they're gonna find you soon\\"<br /><br />Just can't say enough, wish I was a better music critic.
B002Q5L024|4.0|My kids simply love this movie and it really is a precious movie but the language like stupid could have been left out.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Fun for the whole family to enjoy the anamation is great . Easy to play but it has some challenges for you adults.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Imagine if everything you thought you knew wasn't true.  Your Mom hid her past and an entire world from you.  Clary finds herself alone with strangers trying to sort fantasy from fiction and dangerous from supernatural.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I HOPE VOL.2 DOESN'T DISAPPOINT BUT FFDP HAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED BEFORE SO I'M NOT WORRIED!! ALL FFDP ALBUMS ARE AMAZING ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Great music, their second CD is great as well. I got to meet them<br />in Alaska and the whole band was very accommodating and fun to<br />be with.
0062238868|5.0|Grew up in the 50's I loved baseball stil do, didn't realize many stars of that era we veterans. Sniper was a very interesting insight on a sniper's mind set. He really enjoyed killing people. It was ironic how he came to die.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story is a heartwarming story of love and friendship. The ending will surprise most readers. Keep your tissues at hand.
B0024Y9EYS|3.0|Lots of action but I could not really get into the Sarah Connor character. She seemed kinda flat. The other characters were interesting but the show itself could of used more back story in my opinion.  Worth a watch for sure but not my favorite series.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Lately I've been wondering why the battery on my kindle was draining so fast. On a hunch, I thought that this app might be the culprit. I went into settings to delete the app but saw a way to force stop the app so I tried that first. Sure enough as soon as I did that, the battery drain stopped. Even though I enjoyed playing the game, I can not have an app which drains my battery. Therefore this app will be deleted immediately and I will not be buying another app from this company.
B00000JXHB|5.0|I have grown up in Tampa and had the privilege of being a friend of The Outlaws lead guitarist, the late Hughie Thomasson. I have their 16 track &#34;best of&#34; available on Amazon for $7.00. It is recorded well and had everything I wanted. I bought this because it is arguably a collector's item because of the artwork and it is pressed overseas. If you are only going top get one, get this one.
B00DSTBMMU|1.0|I found this album to be a major disappointment. Sheryl has shown the ability to make soulful country music in past performances with Willie Nelson and others. However this album is hardly country at all..... Big rock drums and guitar riffs.... Only not done as well as she has in the past..... Just a boring pandering soulless offering sad
B00065MDSQ|5.0|This album captured my imagination big time when I first listen to this amazing record,I was just about 20 years old in '74 when I went to The Wherehouse Records in Santa Monica and saw the newest KC release on the shelf and grabbed it at once,run home and set the record on my Sony turntable,turn my stereo on and the first track played the first track (Red) and played this track only over and over not knowing that the rest of the album was just as good<br />I've been listening to this record ever since I first got it and still love all the tracks.I recommend this album to everyone who cares about progressive rock..A must album to have....Bless Up!!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I have to admit when the season first began I wasn't happy. But after a few episodes the season turned into one of my favorites. I've watched this show since episode 1. Yes I was that person. This show and it's characters have taken me on so many rides. I've cried, laughed, gasped, been scared,, been pissed. I've wanted to slap all three of the main characters and then in the next scene I want to hug them. The three main actors don't just play these characters. They bring them to life. You worry about them. You truly care about them. I have to say I was dissapointed with season 7 but season 8 made up for any problems I had with 7. Jared Padalecki in particular was brilliant this season. He was absolutely heart breaking in a couple episodes. His acting has really improved as the show has progressed. Not that he was ever bad cause he wasn't. He is so good now though. I truly hope that he gets remembered when People Choice Awards comes around. He really deserves something. I really hope the show is honorred as well. Season 8 was just perfect. Thank you Jeremy Carver.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love it! Cercei finally gets her just deserts at the end. It was a long time coming. Bravo Martin.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|No character development! completely missed on the Katniss/Gale relationship. Haymitch too fit.<br />Cornucopia was too small!!! Lacked punch that was in the book.  Hope the 2nd film is better
B008ACC9CM|5.0|After watching Jonathan & Charlotte singing together on TV several times, I would like to give them more than five stars! These two have such a wonderful blending of their voices.  Their selection of music for this album has been chosen well to demonstrate their vocal abilities together and separately.  Unbelievable vocalists for their young ages.  There is a definite supportive bond between Jonathan and Charlotte to be appreciated.  They certainly meet expectations.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love the game it has a few glitches though. Last number we can't ever get it sucks when it is a bingo number. It also times out a lot  when that happens you lose the credits you used to play. Which is not fair.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|This is Arnold's big feature film re-debut since his time as Governor of California, and he comes back having not lost a step!  The first half of the movie is surprisingly brutal for an Arnold movie, but it definitely lightens up as it goes along.  Lots of cheesy dialogue, but hey--that's why we're here right?!  If you're an Arnold fan this is a must see--there's a reason the man's name is synonymous with good action.  Looking forward to seeing him continue in Terminator 5!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing! I suggest it for everyone. At first I had a hard time getting past Vector, but just recently I finally did. Plus I also have a thing for Steve Carrell:) (Gru). I love this game!!
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|The concept wasn't bad at all: Hansel & Gretel grew up and became Witch Hunters. That *could* have been a great movie.<br /><br />But it wasn't. Instead, it was a cheesy exercise in fairy tale retroconning, which couldn't decide whether it wanted to be taken seriously or not. It tried to be too many things at once -- part horror, part action, part comedy -- and failed to actually succeed at any of them.<br /><br />PRO: I suppose it was a bit of fun. If you don't expect too much out of a movie -- like a thrilling plot, or an excellent script, or superb acting -- then you can watch this and be moderately entertained.<br /><br />CON: The plot was paper thin, the script was mostly dull (and occasionally downright stupid), and the acting was only half-hearted and mediocre at best.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I had never read anything by this author but I have become a fan of her work. I loved the way the characters are connected.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Ugh! Love the game, until now. Downloaded the update when it popped up, now I can't play at all! Click on the first level, and get kicked out of the game! FIX IT!
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I can quote along with this whole movie. Love love love it. Always a good sick day movie to watch in bed.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|We were entertained throughout.  Comedy, darkness, action, drama and more.  This movie held our attention all the way through to the end.  We came in with mid level expectations and again, it far exceeded.  I'm already looking forward to the next release.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|love his voice and the songs he wrote  he is a very inspirational person  aalso loved the movie about him and how it effected an African nation
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Cutest children movie!!! All the kids loved it. They've watched it over and over. Looking forward to see movie 2.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Great price and concept - but it only works with netflix and other for-fee services [ unless short clips on youtube is your thing ]  won't work with Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Was able to get it to work with limited value on the Ipad, but no joy on the laptop - and even on the website PC compatibility is BETA.<br /><br />Web support is very poorly organized, as is live support - Google is swamped because they did not properly vet the product, in their rush to get it out before competing products.<br /><br />It is not a Buy right now - unless you already have one of the fee for service vendors, only 1 device or like to own stuff that has limited functionality and don't mind wasting $35 to own it.<br /><br />it's a paperweight, for really small pieces of paper.<br /><br />Update 9.15.13 - Upgraded to Ok [ but still too pricey for what you get] Customer support responded - I needed to shutdown Vipre security and was able to connect - does not work with Amazon Prime. Tested with Break.com and Yahoo.com videoa and was able to watch videos on the TV. So it's still really only useful for YouTube or Netflix. Hopefully Google will get past BETAware on the PC Chrome interface and allow embedded players to work [ like Amazon ]
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Fabulous!!! Loved the lessons. Using them all. Practicing. I loved the book. Minimum words to comment? Amazon I don't like a minimum word limit.
B00ESY827C|1.0|The quality of the streaming to the kindly fire HD was really bad. While other streaming video have been good. This one was poor quality.
1451695195|5.0|This books provides an interesting insight to life after death and had me wondering why we don't celebrate not only a person's life, but what they have to look forward to.  It would be wonderful if Funeral Homes would offer something more than just the sadness of a life, but based on what people have experienced, offer reflections of another element of life.  As the book reflects, life doesn't end when one dies.  One can get bogged down in the book with some uninteresting facts, but beyond that is a wonderful insight to a credible person's experience.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This will put a decent edge on your blades, it small, light and sturdy. Will sharpen blades of all shapes but  DO NOT HOLD IN HAND TO SHARPEN, PLACE IT ON A TABLE or u gon' cut urself....
B003EEMIV8|5.0|Bought this truck for my 3 year old's birthday.  I wanted a big truck and this fit the bill.  It made me laugh when I opened it and found a sticker on top saying not to sit on it and ride it! And yeah, my son wanted to ride it - it's big enough...<br />After a month of daily use it has held up really well and my son still wants to bring it to bed at night.  I would recommend it and buy more Bruder trucks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Consistently easy to use and I like the large display, and that it shows you the full view of what you have inserted to come to your answer.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Got a sense of the story being far fetched but, nevertheless, entertaining and easy to read. Below his usual standard.
0765334798|1.0|I cannot understand how this book won a Hugo award. I don't know what books were in contention in 2013, and I would say that they had to be awful for \\"Redshirts\\" to win, but that simply can't be the case. This book should have never been considered. I'm not even sure it should have been published. This is the type of novel that someone who doesn't really enjoy reading buys. It's almost all dialog, and it reads like a screenplay. I have no idea how anything, *absolutely* anything, looks in this novel. Even to the end I kept getting the characters confused, because they all have similar sounding names, and none of them are developed. This could have just been one long dialog, and it would have read exactly the same way.<br /><br />Awful writing, awful writing, and the narrative doesn't make any sense. You know what John Scalizi is probably good at? Premises. The premise of this book is why I bought it, and I bet that's why Tor published it. The premise sounds interesting. But boy, is this some terrible writing.
0374172897|5.0|He has loved the book, actually there is the movie too. You can enjoy this lecture very much! First read the book, then watch the movie ;)
B006L0A5P8|4.0|I like this a lot, but I use it on several platforms (iPad, iPod touch, iMac, windows PC) and I wish the ui was consistent among all platforms.  I am also tired of it asking me to remember a password for a site I've been to before just because the URL of the site has made a minimal change in it's address.  Don't like that I had to pay for both the PC and mac versions separately either.  But I do enjoy it's convenience, especially drop box syncing.
B00177YA1K|5.0|The reason I bought it over again was due to the fact I have it on vhs and wanted on dvd
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This film is much more engaging and entertaining, and also has what teh other dredd movie lacked, a plot. Worth watching though numerous continuity and reality elements were lost and some persons were not correct to their defined roles. Good simple plot, lots of gore, judge dread, and a psychic sidekick which is not overdone. 4 out of 5 stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun hope for another update.... It is extremely fun hard to get so far but that is what makes it awesome people keep playing to try and get further hope u have more updates soon this game is so addicting.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great series I love these books. They are fun to read but I must warn they are hard to put down!!!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It was awesome until it updated l didn't get the new version on so mad at Amazon do not update
B004DLPXAO|1.0|had it for a year no problems.....and a week ago it started telling me theres no internent connection......which there is because I surf the net.....i just dont understand....i would have given this app 5 stars up until now....i can no longer read my books on my phone....i have to drag along my kindle if I wanna read :-( ***so upset
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I swear, sometimes my kindle is so glitchy but thanks to this app, it put a huge dent in that 4.3 other non existent space taken up thingies and now I can actually do stuff with my kindle. Thank you!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love the way the game is set up. The trouble is, when I play it and quit out of it, many times it disappears from my Kindle and I have to remove it and reload it. Also, I paid for additional puzzles, and they disappeared after I did the first few.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This DVD arrived at the very best time.  Labor day weekend so my weekend was great fun.. I have enjoyed watching my movies.
B00338QENI|5.0|Read this for my Nursing Research course. I believe this should be required reading for any individual working in healthcare. Many thanks to Henrietta for her exceptional contribution to science and the research and treatment of disease. She deserves the highest honors. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot for telling her story in an intriguing page turner to give this woman the recognition she so readily deserves.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This DVD arrived at the very best time.  Labor day weekend so my weekend was great fun.. I have enjoyed watching my movies. Looking forward to Season 4
B00CATONCA|3.0|I recently received my set the day of release and had issues right out of the box (I actually ordered two as one is staying sealed in the box as I collect walking dead memorabilia). The lights were not working properly and to top it off there were small blemishes on the fish tanks. They weren't huge, but for $100 I did not want to see any scratches on anything. I expressed my concerns and Amazon immediately issued an rma and sent me another one. I recently opened this one and now instead of small blemishes there are scratches on the tanks. I guess I will try for round 3 and hopefully get a good one. I am a fan of Todd McFarlane toys, but for all the time they had to manufacture these items, you would think they would be in a lot better condition.
159463176X|5.0|Another great read from Khaled Hosseini. I was thrilled yet again by this gripping tale from Afganistan. It made me laugh and cry.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I  loooovvve Robert Downey Jr.and Jude Law in both Sherlock movies!  This one continues the adventure this dynamic duo as they work to thwart and bring to justice Dr. Moriarty and his plan to exploit the growing tensions between European countries for profit.  The plot contains steady, non-stop action and yet, the watcher is really impressed with the complexity of the plan and Sherlock's ability to see into Moriarty's head. But our hero is not perfect ( that makes him more believable as a character) and Sherlock makes a mistake which allows for a bombing to kill some very important people of the time.  We see Sherlock's more human side as he tries to help Mary, Dr. Holmes new wife, trust him...by throwing her off a train!  Hmmmm....  The characters are developed enough to enjoy this fast paced and intellectually stimulating movie and I can't wait for them to make this a trilogy!  Surely there are other brilliant, narcissistic, yet mentally unstable bad guys out there for Sherlock and Dr. Holmes to fight!
1439153663|5.0|I was so moved by this tale of life on a plantation in Virginia.It was a great character portrait of Lavinia and the not-so-well known world of indentured servitude.
B00081912E|5.0|Watch it when you need to laugh, you won't be disappointed.  Jim Carey is as wild and zany as ever in this  movie geared toward family movie night. :oD
0061950726|5.0|The characters sprang to life in this book, it made me laugh and cry.  The only problem was that i finished it too quickly, i just could not put it down.I read about 12 GREAT  books great  this summer and this was one of the best.
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|touch nature , colorful ,just love it<br />and the detail was amazing<br />i am going to buy the other one picec
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great, very addicting. It keeps upgrading and adding new things so you never get bored. Great for kids and adults.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Read it a lot<br />  Thanks<br />Would buy your others books<br />As Well and you future books<br />Great to read<br />Great author
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I'm an agnostic.  Although I've previously read accounts of near-death experiences (NDEs), they really didn't trigger spiritual soul-searching on my part.  This book has - not because the story is more compelling, but because the author knows so much about brain structure and function.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Read it a lot<br />  Thanks<br />Would buy your others books<br />As Well and you future books<br />Great to read<br />Great author
B0035WKP5K|5.0|This book clearly shows what muscles are being used for the workout your doing.  Also it's works to reference any area that you want to target and the different workouts to do to work that area.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Read it a lot<br />  Thanks<br />Would buy your others books<br />As Well and you future books<br />Great to read<br />Great author
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Does what it's supposed to do. It's my portable on the go sharpener for my small knife or the Fiskars Axes which I love using.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is fun hunting for hidden objects, but I sort like to avoid the chatting word from the different pirates. I know they quoting whats happening, but I just want to get to to finding the objects.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Love this game. The graphics are great.The theme superb. Played the first time till the battery ran out.Just love the fact this was free.Most of these charge to money.Nice to have a game that holds you're interest and does not charge you extra to play thanks
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|This is a great app, would recommend to anyone to have on your tablet. You download all sort of games,music, books, and much more from this app.

After she got the full version, she's realized she can build underground, make mazes and even go underwater.  The only thing that we don't like is that if you happen to get an animal inside your 'house,' if you try to put it out it'll die.  We don't like when any animals die!  That's the only thing we'd change about it.  But if you build a barn, you can get animals to be in there.  They grow up, too!

1451626096|2.0|Warning: Some Spoilers!  I have loved Philippa Gregory since I first picked up \\"The Other Boylen Girl\\", and have much anticipated every book in the current series \\"The Cousin's War\\" but this was by far the worst book of the series! Elizabeth of York becomes of women of strength but no deepness, no control, none of the behind the scenes wielding of power of the other war of roses women. She's heartsick over her uncle...blech! and then raped repeatedly by Henry VII...then grows to love him?!? All of the magic was gone from this book as well. One of my favorite parts of the Cousin's War books was the magic and descendants of Melusina, etc....but all of this is left behind in this the last book...it's as if Ms. Gregory decided that the line of magic ends with Elizabeth Woodville and she chooses to pass nothing along to her daughter other than the knowledge that Melusina sings when someone dies. It goes on and on about the princes in the tower with some very confusing back and forth...we are led to believe in previous books and this one that one of the brothers got away...then he seems to show up, Elizabeth of York recognizes his smile, but then there is no Melusina song when he dies...its like the author can't decide...is he the missing brother or not? cryptic. Overall its the worst of the series and not worth recommending.

I don't know what is really going on here, if all these copies were truly defective or is this just more slander by Gaga fans?  I know, that is a bit of a stretch maybe...but my copy was just fabulous.  It couldn't look or sound better, the editing is imaginative...this might be her best show ever.  WAAAAAAYYYY better than Sticky and Sweet.  That being said, I did download the audio on iTunes and that is in fact wretched.  But I would recommend buy the blu ray if you are a real fan.  I just wish I could have seen the show live.  I did have tickets but she canceled her first night Dallas show citing \\"severe laryngitis\\" but was apparently just fine for the second night show.  Watching this and seeing how good it was makes me sad all over again!

B00BY7NK96|5.0|I read this book when I was considering changing jobs and it helped give me confidence to negotiate the best terms with my new employer, and also gave me confidence that the risk of moving was worth taking. I have managed mixed gender teams in my career to date and have witnessed a stark difference between how men and women approach their career development. This book addresses the reasons why that is the case. What I really loved about Lean In, is that it is less about blaming men and about what more we women, can do for ourselves. It gives the control to us.<br /><br />Sheryl is an extremely driven lady, whose willingness to return to (full time) work soon after a baby is worlds apart from the rest of us. Despite this, her advice is all very transferable to any woman who is working in any capacity at all.<br /><br />Fantastic read, didn't want it to end.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Interestingly enough, I never thought of L. Frank Baum's \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" as a fairy tale.  Yet, right at the end of the Introduction in this book is this:<br /><br />\\"...the story of \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" was written solely to please children of today.  It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Baum wrote those words back in 1900, so you've got to take those words like \\"today\\" and \\"modernized\\" with a grain of salt.  But, that's neither here nor there.  The important thing is that the story is a nice little read that's suitable for all ages.  Since it appears that just about the whole world is familiar with this work solely through MGM's 1939 movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" with Judy Garland, it's also amusing to see the vast differences between that movie and this originating work (especially the Kansas material).  Though the book is squarely aimed at children, and I'm an old curmudgeon, I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.

B00C70FG2S|4.0|\\"Bend it to our will / Dream it into form / Shape it in our image...\\"<br /><br />The lines to the chorus of \\"The Science of Noise\\" establish the central theme of \\"Construct,\\" with even just the title itself revealing it: \\"Science\\" pertaining to order and logic; \\"noise\\" implying chaos and calamity.<br /><br />From the standpoint of the album cover, which depicts a shrunken, alien-like Frankenstein's monster, the artist can be seen as displaying an imperfect creation. Someone has clearly \\"constructed\\" this beast, but in a haphazard way; it looks as if the creator just cut and pasted random bits of completely different bone, flesh, and machine to form its unwieldy body. Even though it's a sentient being, it is a chaotic, noisy figure indeed. It's a dramatic shift from the spare artwork of Dark Tranquillity's past few records.<br /><br />\\"It twists and turns / Into something that is not to be...\\"<br /><br />From a musical standpoint, Dark Tranquillity has never been the fastest or heaviest band, but they have always been one of the most versatile, and that versatility to their creative process as a unit is the attribute most emphasized on this 2013 release.<br /><br />Simply from the first five songs on \\"Construct,\\" the fan appreciates the rich textures and approaches Dark Tranquillity took: the melancholy introductory storm \\"For Broken Words,\\" the stripped-down guitar focus of \\"The Science of Noise,\\" \\"Uniformity\\"'s surprising major-key chorus; \\"The Silence In Between,\\" the piano-driven single; and the rapid-fire thrash of \\"Apathetic.\\"<br /><br />By the time the clean singing of \\"What Only You Know\\" comes in, any expectations of dry repetition or recycling on the band's part is laid to rest.<br /><br />Summer 2013 saw some of the worst rioting in Sweden in many years, and against this backdrop \\"Construct\\" can perhaps be seen as an expose of our limitations, not only as human beings but also as a society. Why do we believe what we believe, hate what we hate?<br /><br />The overall somber, searching mood of the album is best captured in the gloomy echo of \\"State of Trust\\" and in the opening moments of \\"Immemorial,\\" truly one of Dark Tranquillity's greatest arrangements in a 20-year-plus career. Although vocalist Mr. Stanne has compared \\"Construct\\" to resemble 1999's \\"Projector\\" record, this release from a maturing Dark Tranquillity has an even more expansive take on our \\"human constructs.\\"<br /><br />The figure on the cover may seem repulsive, but there is great beauty in this \\"Construct.\\"<br /><br />Mikael Stanne<br />Martin Henriksson<br />Niklas Sundin<br />Anders Jivarp<br />Martin Brandstromhe overall somber, searching mood of the album is best captured in the gloomy echo of \\"State of Trust\\" and in the opening moments of \\"Immemorial,\\" truly one of Dark Tranquillity's greatest arrangements in a 20-year-plus career.

B000002KB8|5.0|A sallow, sunken face with pitch-black eyes stares out from underneath the hood of a black robe.  A grainy, Halloween landscape surrounds the figure: the ominous gray farmhouse in the distance, the gnarled and dying woods streaked with deep red, the white-gray dread of the blanket of clouds.  It's a truly eerie picture that seems more appropriate for a horror movie poster than an album cover.<br /><br />But record buyers who were not repulsed by this cover but rather were drawn to it would discover the original heavy metal blueprint.  Although there are only 5 songs on the record, each one had a hand in establishing Black Sabbath's cult following, especially in the English Midlands.<br /><br />The title track is considered by some to be Sabbath's signature song.  By working the \\"flatted-fifth\\" tri-tone note on the blues scale for a horrific atmosphere, \\"Black Sabbath\\" scared many out of their seats, including yours truly. It is like the slow build-up to the final climactic scene in a horror film, like venturing down into a dark tunnel underneath a graveyard. The shift from doom-laden slowness into the chugging overdrive a few minutes into the song became one of Sabbath's trademarks.<br /><br />In addition to the title track there are two more normal-length songs and two longer (10-minute plus) \\"suites\\" consisting of multiple sections. Sabbath had played these on the road for many months before entering the studio to put them down on vinyl.  Although they would record many more excellent tracks together, Sabbath never revisited this style of multiple-song suites on any of their subsequent albums, making them a unique sight on this first LP.<br /><br />The first of these suites comes on the heels of \\"The Wizard,\\" which may be the only instance of harmonica in a heavy metal song (that I know of, at least).<br /><br />The \\"Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep\\" section fades into drummer Bill Ward authoritatively keeping time, the reverb from his kit establishing a very \\"live improvisation in a small pub\\" atmosphere.  He then turns it over to bassist Geezer Butler, who navigates his bass for a bit before finding his mark with the lurching main riff of \\"NIB,\\" another Sabbath classic.<br /><br />Ward picks up a jazzy hi-hat rhythm for \\"Wicked World,\\" which also features an extended break for lead guitarist Tony Iommi to show that his famed industrial accident, during which he lost two fingers, has not dulled his virtuosity.  He takes an even longer solo spot during the final track.  A 14-minute suite, \\"A Bit of Finger\\" starts with some somber, \\"scary early morning\\" atmospheric picking, and eases into a blues-based second half to finish off the record.<br /><br />With its then-unheard-of, bluesy horror-film atmosphere, \\"Black Sabbath\\" became a Top 10 hit on both sides of the Atlantic.  And of course, this album is largely considered the official kick-off point for all things metal-related.  If you're looking for an introduction to heavy metal music, there are still (more than 40 years later!) few better places to start than right here--with the original quartet spreading its hopeful wings and launching the ship of the greatest music on earth.<br /><br />Ozzy Osbourne<br />Tony Iommi<br />Geezer Butler<br />Bill Wardmprovisation in a small pub\\" atmosphere.

B000000H4V|4.0|\\"I don't think we should imitate the West; I think we should have our own thing,\\" Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera says to Sam Dunn during an interview in the desert in \\"Global Metal.\\"<br /><br />His statement rings powerfully true on \\"Chaos A.D.,\\" with Sepultura's overt Brazilian influences coming to the forefront of their special brand of thrash metal. Tribal instruments and rhythms make memorable appearances, and they contribute to a wonderful, infectious energy throughout the record.<br /><br />Drummer Igor Cavalera could be the MVP of this album; his percussion efforts, however they were tracked, sound huge.  You can clearly hear each individual rapid-fire hit of the tom-toms. This relatively loud mix fits right in with Sepultura's monumental riffs and Max's Third World growl to create the signature sound of Brazilian metal. In fact, it was this album that marked Sepultura's transition from a talented-but-straightforward thrash metal group with a lot of potential to the pioneers of \\"world metal.\\"<br /><br />Not only was \\"Chaos A.D.,\\" Sepultura's most successful album to date at the time, it is also one of their most political. \\"Refuse/Resist\\" tells of the ravages of war, while \\"Manifest\\" addresses the brutality of the Sao Paulo Police (apparently they massacred 200 inmates in a raid on a prison in October 1992). Graphic black and white photos of both themes fill the album jacket along with this dedication for the song \\"Kaiowas\\":<br /><br />\\"This song is inspired by the Brasilian Indian tribe called `Kaiowas,' who live in the rainforest. They committed mass suicide as a protest against the government, who was trying to take away their land and beliefs.\\"<br /><br />As the first three songs on this album are acknowledged Sepultura classics, I was a bit concerned about a dip in quality after \\"Slave New World\\" ended, but that was emphatically not the case, as \\"Amen\\" seamlessly keeps the energy up. The themes of dystopia and the seedy underbelly of the modern world are well explored here (as you can see from the cover, depicting a mummified man at the mercy of the inhuman machines).<br /><br />As of this time of writing, violent protests rock Sepultura's home country, showing that the truth of their observations did not stop with the 1990s. Perhaps because the members of Sepultura have experienced that clash of the modern world so directly and explicitly in their home country of Brazil, they are able to write about them so effectively.  But Sepultura has shown that this struggle can be overcome with inner strength and defiance, as they send off their fans with the below greeting in the album jacket:<br /><br />\\"Thank you to all our fans and friends, from Jakarta to Moscow!....F*** off: envious, trendy, fake, racist people. Believe in yourself!\\"<br /><br />Max Cavalera<br />Andreas Kisser<br />Paulo Jr.<br />Igor Cavalerae well explored here (as you can see from the cover, depicting a mummified man at the mercy of the inhuman machines).<br /><br />As of this time of writing, violent protests rock Sepultura's home country, showing that the truth of their observations did not stop with the 1990s.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Don't read the last part of this book in public unless you like openly weeping in front of strangers. It's nearly equal parts funny, sweet, cynical and heartbreaking. A great read for teens and adults.
B0000048CP|5.0|\\"You ARE walking out of here with that,\\" my metal friend commanded, nodding towards the copy of this album with a five-dollar price tag in my hand. \\"You won't be sorry.\\"<br /><br />I had come into the black metal genre rather later than I had gotten into other genres, and although I like it now, it was a bit of an acquired taste for me personally. With such a profusion of bands and very few universally agreed-upon classics, I was looking for a good place to start. Luckily, even the most elitist black metaller would have no issue starting with the legendary Bathory and this incredible classic.<br /><br />Needless to say, I did walk out of the record store with it that day and entered the world of black metal as soon as I slipped on the headphones.<br /><br />The painting on the cover of \\"Blood, Fire, Death\\" depicts a mythological battle; the original was created in 1872 by Peter Nicolai Arbo \\"Asganrdsteien\\" and hangs in the Norwegian National Gallery in Oslo. Two armies clash, both human beings and otherworldly beasts as the sun breaks over the skyline. Although it evokes medieval times, the choice of this image is appropriate for the time period the album was released.<br /><br />1988 was the Cold War, the clash of two worlds still carrying on in the modern globe outside the painting, and you can't help wondering whether Bathory mastermind Quorthon (Tomas Forsberg) chose it for commentary on the political environment at the time. The song \\"Holocaust,\\" for instance, describes a terrifying image of a room filled with innumerable nuclear warheads, each with the name of a target city on it. The nameless narrator can only stand in terror as the countdown to launch reaches zero. Considering the time period, the threat of such an event happening was still very real.<br /><br />\\"Blood Fire Death\\" details its Viking war themes in a beautifully epic way, with its raw, blazing riffs and blast beats complemented by the occasional choral backup and acoustic interlude. The lyrics describe the fields of battle both earthly and heavenly. Not bad for being recorded in someone's garage in Stockholm.<br /><br />The second half of the album is loaded with a quartet of black/Viking metal classics, including the aforementioned \\"Holocaust.\\" \\"For All Those Who Died\\" and \\"Dies Irae\\" are primal songs with apocalyptic themes and frenetic, powerful riffage, setting the stage for the epic finale and my personal pick for the greatest black metal song of all time: the title track, \\"Blood Fire Death.\\" Summoning the warriors to battle, the song builds from a doom-laden first half laced with organ and choir into a slow gallop. It fades into the winds of mayhem, a Bathory tradition that has the feeling of leaving the battle behind for now until we revisit it.<br /><br />\\"Bloody, fiery, and deadly,\\" was my joking response when my friend asked me what I thought of the album later that same day. Naturally, from metal-ese that translated as \\"magnificent.\\"<br /><br />Quorthon (Tomas Forsberg)<br />Vvornth<br />Kothaardescribe the fields of battle both earthly and heavenly.

B00005R62N|5.0|From the Japanese audience's eager singalong on the very first song on this album (\\"Fall to your knees and repent if you please!\\"), it's clear that this early incarnation of legendary metal group Judas Priest knew how to work a crowd. The band appears onstage at Kaseinenkin Hall on the cover in full black leather and studs regalia, surrounded by bright lights and billowing smoke. Upon release, the album established Priest as one of the metal's live heavyweights and also comes in handy as an unofficial \\"best of\\" 1970s Judas Priest--containing most of their early hit songs.<br /><br />A lot of these songs aren't played live anymore, which is a shame because Priest's early work was much more fiery and raw than their 80s output. The live versions crackle with gentle reverb, and the guitar solos especially are given new life in this sweaty, packed early live setting.<br /><br />\\"Stand up for Exciter!\\" vocalist Rob halford orders the Japanese in the namesake opener. The echo from the guitar intro to \\"Diamonds and Rust\\" fills the theater. \\"Sinner,\\" \\"Delivering the Goods,\\" and \\"The Green Manalishi\\" carry the night with simple but authoritative riffing.<br /><br />But the most well-known highlight here is Halford's stunning vocal prowess on \\"Victim of Changes,\\" turning an already excellent song into a true epic. About halfway through the track, the band settles into a subtle breakdown, with only drummer Les Binks hammering away at a midtempo--the calm before the storm, as it were.<br /><br />Halford leads the finale starting in a low baritone before building all the way up to an inhuman shriek several octaves up: \\"Victim of Changes!!!\\" The audience at the time can be pictured looking at one another in astonishment and asking, \\"Did he really just do that?\\" I know I did! The inclusion of \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" is a fitting encore, a terrific wail of a song that stands as one of the band's most classic moments, live or otherwise.<br /><br />\\"Unleashed In the East\\" hearkens back to an earlier time, when Judas Priest was poised for true liftoff into \\"legend\\" status...back before they were filling arenas and stadiums, Priest was a hungry, passionate band playing to small crowds of only a few hundred to a thousand. This album takes you back to those early days.<br /><br />It could be the best live metal album ever released.<br /><br />Rob Halford<br />Glenn Tipton<br />KK Downing<br />Ian Hill<br />Les Binksk to an earlier time, when Judas Priest was poised for true liftoff into \\"legend\\" status...back before they were filling arenas and stadiums, Priest was a hungry, passionate band playing to small crowds of only a few hundred to a thousand.

B00005NNMJ|4.0|Accept had been a band under the watchful eye of Mr. Udo Dirkschneider for about 13 years before they finally achieved serious success with this powerful, speed metal classic.<br /><br />Sure, they had been noticed: the prior year, prescient metalheads (especially in Deutschland) had been treated to such influential Accept songs as \\"Fast As A Shark\\" and \\"Princess Of the Dawn.\\" But it was in 1984 when Accept would produce a record that would be a key influence on the still-nascent thrash metal movement both in Germany and all around the world.<br /><br />LA-style hair metal did not yet have a complete stranglehold on the charts, but Accept was already cultivating an image and a sound that was the polar opposite of the fishnets and long hair of the Sunset Strip. Udo himself looked as if he was ready to walk down Sunset Boulevard cracking skulls: short blond hair, a penchant for camouflage and military boots, and fingerless gloves over his stubby fingers.<br /><br />The songs on \\"Balls To the Wall\\" all have the sound of a revolution in the making, with the heavily-accented drums tracked to sound like the pounding thud of an army on the march and the gang-style vocals, going in a back-and-forth with Udo's strangled growl of a voice. You'd expect to hear it shouted through a megaphone at the head of a political march. This image is best suited to the anthemic title track, \\"Balls To the Wall.\\"<br /><br />But Accept's strong approach is not limited to the first track--\\"London Leatherboys\\" finds the German band taking on a very \\"British\\" topic--bikers and leather. Lyricist Gaby Hauke (band manager t the time) lent a unique (for the time) female perspective on the late-night trysts of \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Turn Me On,\\" simmering with sexual tension.<br /><br />Overall the entire \\"Balls To the Wall\\" experience is one of a strident march tempo-wise, going double-time for \\"Fight It Back\\" and \\"Losers and Winners,\\" lessening to a stroll for the snow, fog, and church bells of \\"Winterdreams.\\"<br /><br />Even considering Accept's recent resurgence without Udo, for better or for worse the new lineup's success will be compared to these halcyon days of the mid-1980s, when Accept was (and still is) one of the most exciting metal bands in the world.<br /><br />Udo Dirkschneider<br />Wolf Hoffman<br />Hermann Frank<br />Peter Baltes<br />Stefan Kaufmannnterdreams.\\"<br /><br />Even considering Accept's recent resurgence without Udo, for better or for worse the new lineup's success will be compared to these halcyon days of the mid-1980s, when Accept was (and still is) one of the most exciting metal bands in the world.<br /><br />Udo Dirkschneider<br />Wolf Hoffman<br />Hermann Frank<br />Peter Baltes<br />Stefan Kaufmann

In many ways, Israel is an ideal place to create \\"Mabool,\\" a concept album with a mythological take on the origins of the three religions that dominate the land: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.<br /><br />\\"We all pray to the same God,\\" Kobi Farhi observed in an interview with Sam Dunn.<br /><br />\\"Why the conflict?\\" seems to be the unasked question there. \\"Mabool\\" sets its answer to music in this fine 2004 effort.<br /><br />Told through a mystifying blend of heavy metal, harsh and clean vocals, progressive songwriting and keyboards, and traditional Middle Eastern instruments, \\"The Story of the Three Sons of Seven\\" goes something like this:<br /><br />Eons ago, the mythical seventh son of a seventh son was split into three different entities \\"for fear of their strength.\\" They each became one of the three faiths, the People of the Book: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. God became furious with their sins and failings and vowed to destroy the earth in a flood. After trying and failing to warn the world of the impending danger, the 3 sons construct the Ark to rescue themselves and their followers. They are able to ride the storm out, but although they are guided to dry land, their rivalry continues despite all the commonality they share. As the song title goes, \\"The Storm Still Rages Inside.\\"<br /><br />No one has come up with a label for this entire package yet, but it doesn't need one.<br /><br />There are plenty of opportunities to thrash and headbang during \\"Mabool\\" (the iconic \\"Ocean Land,\\" \\"The Kiss of Babylon\\"), but there is also plaintive, mournful cry of \\"A'salk\\" and the radio-friendly pop of \\"Norra el Norra.\\" The packaging is loaded with scriptural verses from all the faiths for the theologian and philosopher among us to evaluate at leisure.<br /><br />Although the Israeli flair is definitely emphasized, it isn't overwhelming or stereotypical, and the Middle Eastern elements and rhythms mix with traditional metal in beautiful new ways. There is a dignity within Orphaned Land's work that is undeniable here, that suits their purpose to explore the both the heavy and light aspects of faith.<br /><br />After the release of \\"Mabool,\\" Orphaned Land became the go-to Israeli heavy metal band, helping to establish that country as a legitimate force in the world of heavy metal. But even more than that, \\"Mabool\\" is the sound of a group of passionate young Israelis offering their interpretation of the birth of their beloved homeland--and the mysterious forces still at work there.<br /><br />Kobi Farhi<br />Sassi Saharon<br />Matti Svatizki<br />Uri Zelcha<br />Eden Rabinthe Middle Eastern elements and rhythms mix with traditional metal in beautiful new ways.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Cannot put it down! A book with compassionate characters, lots of intense feelings in ordinary life scenes. Learn much about yourself.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|So glad I was able to see season 2 before 3 starts... Great show... love the instant viewing... Thank you Amazon!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Five stars for the Dowager Countess's witty rejoinders, Anna's general kindness and unending and deep faith in and love for Bates, Bates' observations of human nature, Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes' firm yet kind managing of the staff and respect of the Crawley family, the conflict between O'Brien and Thomas, Edith's journey of discovering herself, and so much more!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|A great plot that allows the reader to see how Jack's U.S. Army career wound down, and once again shows him at his best.  Lot's of action that is tied to a plot that requires all of his deductive powers to figure out the villain and deliver Reacher style justice.
B003L77GGK|5.0|The DVD came in great condition and was packed well. I love this show so like having it on DVD to play when I want.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|It's an awesome game.  It's like you're flying an actual airplane.  It takes a little too long to lock on the missile.  However, I do not recommend the Israel version, it's not as fun.
B001NAT05W|4.0|a fresh take on  the catwoman themes .storyline and casting are very good. special effects are done well  considering age of movie.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I really am not one who likes books about the holocaust, although it a part of history we should forget about, I loved this book. The tragedy for all involved in World War II abounds in this book. I hope the world never forgets and this book exemplifies the naivety of the horrors of war.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Everyone talks about it. I haven't had time to watch it after almost 6 months but I've loaned it out and everyone gives it great reviews. It looks like I'm not going to get it in before the next season so I guess I'll buy season 3 as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool I like it so much just plain awesome  it's good for every one<br />Who likes temple run and subway surfers
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I  loved it can't wait for more!  Martin is a fantastic writer mixing romance and fantasy perfectly which was very surprising to me.  I decided to read the books because of the show and see that the show has stuck very closely to the book for the most part but of course  the books are always better than the show
B004FUVEC4|5.0|Loved it!!!! It is a very whimsical yet intriguing and funny movie. It takes you through a journey of emotions. You certainly don't get bored. The photography is beautiful!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's awesome fun for all kids and teens. All young and old would love this game like candy crush yay!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|On the plus side, it is cheap and came with 3 months of netflix. On the down side, not many apps were supported and mirroring a device via a chrome browser, involves downloading the content to the device you want to mirror, then sending that content back to google, which in turn sends it back to the chromecast. In summary, stick with AppleTV
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a fun game,the downside is you have to buy points in order to get deeper into the game.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|I think this is one of the best western movies that has been made in the last 30 years. I enjoyed it very much. The acting is excellent, the story very engaging and the cinematography beautiful. I only have positive things to say..I highly recommend this movie..big thumbs up!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!!! :D My fave!! It's so challenging yet it's still fun!! Some games are too challenging &amp; turn into zero fun after a while. This game is different though!! I would definitely recommend this game!! :)
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I actually watched the Avengers movie before I viewed Iron Man, Thor or Captain America. I wish I had seen the others first in order to be up to speed on the characters. I have seen them all several times now. Needless to say I am hooked on Marvel's super hero's movies. I even go to the movie theater to get an early viewing of them. Avengers is my favorite, because you get a sampling of each character. Action packed and it makes you wish there was another one coming out soon. It is a Character driven story line, Tony Stark, Iron Man, is a big draw for this movie, however each character is shown with their strengths and if you are not a comic book fan and don't already know the stories behind each one, watching this movie makes you want to see the other movies in Marvel's line up. If you are a super hero fan, this is one you will want to watch over and over again.
0811833887|5.0|Excellent friends, in my first shopping in this web page and amazon is a great place for buy any kind of stuff. The book is great. I'm coming from Mexico and is not easy to get this products here. Thanks a lot and I think this web page is a great chance to buy online.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Typical great Mission Impossible movie with lots of action and suspense.  Overall I'm not a bug Tom Cruise fan but his roles in Mission Impossible films have been good.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoyed the clean, clear graphics this game provides and the fast paced game time environment.<br />Beginner to Pro this game works for all
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and again on a cruise ship and I think it's great for a Tom Cruise film.  Exciting and suspensful, very well done.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|This game can be quite challenging, I enjoy the fact that you can return to a favorite room and play again.
B00CS9987W|5.0|The birds on blu ray is fantastic, the picture quality is a massive upgrade over the DVD which I watched to compare scenes for resolution.  The sound is terrific though this film deserved the 5.1 treatment that was given to psycho and vertigo blu rays.  The special effects scenes and rear projection scenes date the film a bit but overall those things should not detract from the viewing experience as they are a source problem, not a problem with the transfer.  I think the birds looks as good as it will probably ever look and the only upgrade I would suggest is the 5.1 sound for a future blu ray release
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really fun and I can not wait to start playing and getting more dragons I love this game
0142428280|5.0|Bought this for my husband to listen to while on long driving trips.  He is very pleased.  He commented that the readers voice is very eay to listen to--distinguishing dialogue between characters is made easier by the differnet voices he uses.  Easier than some of the other audio books he has used.
B001EOOQF6|5.0|Following the firing of original frontman Ozzy Osbourne in 1980, Black Sabbath recruited equally-as-talented frontman Ronnie James Dio. And with him they recorded two wildly successful efforts, 1980's \\"Heaven And Hell\\" and `81's \\"Mob Rules.\\" The former of the two records was an undisputed milestone, and one that created a big, long shadow in which the latter lives under. But even if it sounds a touch too much like \\"H.A.H.\\" at times (it does follow the same basic blueprint as its predecessor), and regardless of the fact that it is an overlooked and/or underrated gem in the Sabbath discography, \\"M.R.\\" is an excellent album.  It is filled with all of the band's usual goodies: Simple yet memorable riffs, epic solos, meaty bass lines, and wailing, fantastically catchy vocals.<br /><br />There are a few experimental endeavors to be had here -- whole-heartedly successful stabs at innovation, if you will. For the first example of such, proceed directly to \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross,\\" a sprawling, eight minute long epic which is not only the album's indisputably masterful highpoint, but also a standout in Black Sabbath's whole discography, as well. It begins on a gorgeous note with heavenly acoustic strings and Dio's falsetto, harmonizing vocals before graduating to heavy territory with big, momentously brutal power chords and a deft, martial-sounding drum beat. But no matter how heavy the number may get, Dio's vocals remain classically melodic and soaring, sounding not unlike Bruce Dickinson in parts. \\"Southern Cross\\"'s outro is also noteworthy, as it is centered around a terrific, harmonic, and just plain wailing melodic guitar lead/solo. And the second wholly-experimental inclusion is the immediately ensuing \\"ES150,\\" a terrifically trippy and ethereal, synth-driven instrumental interlude-esque cut.<br /><br />For the most part, though, \\"Mob Rules\\" does retain the classic Sabbath sound. The album opens in strong enough fashion with \\"Turn Up The Night\\" being a fairly blistering and very propulsive set opener that finds Dio's vocals soaring majestically over a blast of heavy, crunching guitars, grumbling bass, and thumping skins. A handful of memorable guitar solos intermittently flare up to pepper the arrangements, here, as well. The bass-heavy \\"Voodoo\\" is a much more concertedly mid-tempo/restrained cut that finds muscular bass throbs driving the tune forward. The only time the bass relents, here, is when it adopts some unorthodox, high-pitched, shredding guitar soloing.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the lyrics to \\"The Mob Rules\\" are very fitting because they find Dio wailing away lines like \\"playing with fire.\\" This is fitting because the song is a surprisingly up-tempo and fiery rocker, and one that is complete with air-guitar-able guitar pyrotechnics near its end. And it is followed-up by \\"Country Girl,\\" which might darn well be the record's catchiest cut. Its hooky, staccato riffs create a memorable, rhythmic groove, while Geezer Butler's bass is heard grumbling away from beneath the mix, supplying the track with a pronounced and prominent bottom-end.<br /><br />Working your way through the rest of the album, \\"Slipping Away\\" and \\"Over And Over\\" are two other very decent cuts. The former finds some really deft, thundering, and standout-worthy drum fills augmented by unorthodox guitar soloing and some strangulated bass soloing; and the latter is a very moody and melancholy closing ballad with more stellar vocals and guitar work. But sandwiched between these two awesome songs is \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World,\\" which is even better. It is a bit of an overlooked gem in Black Sabbath's discography, as has never quite gotten the recognition that it deserves. It begins as a dreary, strung-out ballad with violin accompaniment before soon picking up ample speed and momentum thanks to six-string ace Tony Iommi dropping an awesome, massive, pure doom metal riff into the middle of things. \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" then proceeds torock out profusely for the remainder of its duration.<br /><br />\\"Mob Rules\\" is widely considered to be the last respectable album in the Black Sabbath catalogue (until, of course, 2013's triumphant return-to-form, \\"13\\".) But this reviewer disagrees with that statement. Why? Because \\"M.R.\\" is so much more than just merely \\"respectable.\\" It is an album that is excellent enough to be considered a classic Sabbath release, and one that might not be quite as good as say, 1970's \\"Paranoid,\\" but is right up there (in terms of greatness) with the band's aforementioned 1980 release, \\"Heaven And Hell.\\" Essential listening.rock out profusely for the remainder of its duration.<br /><br />\\"Mob Rules\\" is widely considered to be the last respectable album in the Black Sabbath catalogue (until, of course, 2013's triumphant return-to-form, \\"13\\".)

B001HN6922|5.0|kids watched this over and over and over again for months... it's still a great go-to movie ;-)<br />love it
B009PHRIEA|5.0|this is billy cobham. quite possibly the best drummer ever. all the music here is original, fresh and remarkable. you will need a very open mind, and ability to groove to get these.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I played this game before and maxed out.  I see new things and like what I see so far.  Now we have the ability to release them back to the wild.  That is real nice.  Keep up the good work!!!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie was great for the whole family.  It was very funny. We could serioysly watch it many more times
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I just finished watching this film for the fourth time since I originally purchased the DVD.  That doesn't count the time I watched it at the theatre. This film for me was this good and I enjoyed it a lot. It is a film with great acting, action, Sci-Fi and CGI special effects.  It is so good that it has great replay value and it is a DVD that deserves to be added to your collection.<br /><br />As a fan of Star Trek since it was released this film stays loyal to the original characters and the storyline. I rate it at 5 stars.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|It's a depressingly slow decent into madness and what it truly means to be lonely. Her written voice is so strong and powerful. It's such a beautiful book.
B005LAII44|4.0|In typical GI Joe style this movie is full of fast action and big guns and fighting scenes and a lot of special effects and a lot of acrobatic fight scenes.  I like that style of movie so for me this film was OK.  The script and the action is what you would expect from this type of film.  It is sort of a B class of movie with a big budget and a lot of stars.  It certainly is entertaining and worth watching at least once.<br /><br />There is no deep moral aspect to the film it is just made for action and entertainment and as long as you watch it with that aspect in mind you will enjoy it.  I rated it 4 stars as it was fun to watch.  It is one of those films that you can stream to your TV and enjoy but you don't necessarily need to buy the DVD.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Awesome game...easy to follow but not too easy...that's what makes it fun and interesting.  I would recommend it to adults and kids alike.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This is a very good Sci-Fi movie and follows the same type of quality as the best of the Star Trek movies of the past. The special effects are very good and quality of the performances of the cast are spot on and bring across the personality and relationships that the characters have developed as they begin to meld themselves into a young crew of a Federation starship. Chris Pine is molding himself into the role of Captain Kirk quite well and he brings a type of enthusiasm into the roll that makes you simply want him and the crew to succeed. I won't go into the movie plot as you have to watch the film and enjoy it.<br /><br />This is a great film and I rated it as a 5 star movie. I do wish that the script had not depended so much on bringing back so many of the Star Trek clich&eacute;s and old characters. After all the future is different with the destruction of the Vulcan home world in the first movie of this series and there are so many opportunities for many great plots and events to occur differently. The future films do not have to fall so much in line with the old antagonist characters and there is a whole galaxy to explore.<br /><br />That being said the film is still exciting and action packed. It is interesting to watch the relationship between captain Kirk and Spock evolve and to see how Spock has a relationship with Lieutenant Uhura. This is one of those films that you will have to watch several times to take in all of the action packed scenes and really enjoy them. I recommend that you watch this film and buy the DVD.
B00AEK9BKQ|1.0|PPL giving this movie 5 stars? really? LOL must be because helen hunt showed her entire body including her Vajayjay through the whole movie. I couldnt stomach it.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Like so many movies today, nothing of value in this film, just a lot of visual effects.. It's sad the movie industry no longer wishes to put out quality movies.  They say audiences today don't have the attention span for a story line.  I'm 41 and I keep watching the same movies I saw when I was a kid for lack of anything of quality today.  Not only movies but tv also.  I think its time the public starts complaining instead of accepting that this is the way it is.  I find this movie an insult to my intelligence and t the original....
B00DQVST76|4.0|I understand why she produced this the way she did and for that reason I gave it a better rating. If you intend to sit down with popcorn for a live concert experience you may be disappointed. But Madonna ALLOWED iphones into her concert and as a result Youtube is saturated with all the realistic concert experience footage you could possibly want. So this is different. And as with everything else she does, way better than anything we could get from mediocre talent of today's coattail riders.<br /><br />AND you'll love the behind-the-scene footage at the end giving us a peak of how she escapes, probably to her hotel or airport. Brilliant.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I didn't like it in 7th grade and I don't like it now in college. The story is just silly. Read something like &#34;Cutting for Stone&#34;

034580404X|5.0|I had heard so much about 50 shades of Grey. It took me a while to decide I wanted d to read these books and I'm so glad I did. I love the fact that I can borrow kindle books from my local library and doesn't cost a thing. I read all 3 of these books in no time and loved them all. Christian made me laugh and cry. It's sad to think what happened to him has really happened to a lot of kids because of their parents being on drugs. Very good books. I highly recommended them. Great work El James
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it. Keeps me sane. I use it for my Magic 8 Ball. I ask it a yes or no question. A win is a yes. Now I get to buy the motorcycle I have been wanting. I cannot ask God for material things but I sure can ask Solitaire.
B00EB6F1TY|1.0|Ok movie. Wasn't really impressed. But again I went in the theater with high expectations. I'll stick to rewatching the avengers, ironman1 & thor. Please don't use this director again for any Marvel movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Took a while to understand what was going on but after finishing the series I have enjoyed it and am watching the other seasons now.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was hoping I would be able to stream my amazon prime without having to get a cable! Oh well.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I was looking for a fun hidden picture story game and this delivered!!! I haven't had to spend a penny yet. Looking forward to seeing what lies ahead!
B002ZG4Q5W|3.0|The film of course is fantastic, though you probably already know that if you're thinking about buying a copy.<br /><br />More usefully, I can say that the picture quality isn't great. It seems to have aggressive edge enhancement on top of what must be very grainy/noisy source material. I think it is an attempt to compensate for the soft print. In any case, it's not the best combination. I'm not too upset however, because it is about half the price of a Criterion disc. If I'd paid that much, I'd probably be much grumpier about it.<br /><br />There is also the minor annoyance, that even on a blu-ray release, there are black borders on all four sides of the frame. There are 2-5 black (wasted) vertical lines on the left and right of the picture. This may have been necessary to mitigate CRT alignment issues once upon a time, but if you're playing blu-ray, i think it's safe to say your projecting all the pixels to a digital display.<br /><br />The audio on the other hand is great. Both the stereo and the 5.1 tracks are lossless. And the stereo mix down is great because they used to care about that once upon a time.
B009LDD22U|5.0|Season six really is a good one.  I love the interactions within the main six characters.  This one also has some of the most laugh-out-loud funny moments as well.  Can't wait for season seven to start, and this one is a great purchase!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Boring insipid characters engaged in narcissistic self examination that never rises above the level of sophomoric, emotionally stunted musings...which would be fine if at least the sex parts were entertaining. This book is a big glob of mediocrity that has captured people's imaginations mostly because, I think, it has managed to put a slightly more sophisticated veneer on a type of novel that is nothing new. It has done this by branding and publicity and almost nothing else, because there is nothing sophisticated about the writing. This isn't a bad book...it's a bleh book. Also, and this is just my personal taste, is it truly the case that the kinds of characters the fans of this work enjoy reading about are so physically perfect to the point of disappearing into their own perfection? I read the descriptions of Anastasia and Christian and they seem almost antiseptic in their physical perfection. They're mannequins, not people. Weird.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|This is an excellent zombie flick. This film is full of terror, action, and gore with a strong plot that to ties it all together nicely.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Very nicely done and the uniqueness of the puzzles really made me \\"lose myself\\" for quite sometime while I played endlessly.  For me, it will provide lots of enjoyment as I work through the levels, but not sure how many there are, or how long that \\"happiness\\" will last, but for now I'm very well pleased.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my fave app!<br />Back before this app came out I was sad because there was only x box and Pc versions and I couldn't take it anywhere D:<br />Now I can I'm so happy get this app its way worth the $<br />:D
B0091REZMW|5.0|Just as fun to play on my Kindle Fire as it is on Facebok. Only downfall is waiting for friends.

B003VPWX6K|5.0|An incredible reflection of one`s past and self worth. A bittersweet telling of devotion and loyalty and the costs that come with them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great game for the whole family. young or elder. you will absolutely love this game.  I love themes minion beach as well. :)
B000SW4DV2|5.0|This is one of my Grandson's favorite movies.  I was so excited to know that I had received a free day to watch this with my order (and so was he).
0425263924|1.0|It is the worst book of the three. Lengthened the story for nothing . I will not continue reading something like this.
B000002AQQ|5.0|If you've seen the movie you'll love to be able to picture every scene with each song ! If you haven't seen it, just enjoy all the joy.
B0089XH38M|1.0|This use to be a great program but the latest update wants permission to make calls to any number on my phone, send emails to my contacts ect. It also wants to be able to use the gps to locate where I am. This has become a program that I wanted an anti virus program to protect against. There is no reason they need to be collecting info about me, or sending/calling my contacts! It shouldn't be doing anything with out my permission and seeking to do the things it wants to behind the installers back! This has become a data mining app, I am very disappointed!
B000WMEAKC|5.0|There's so much love and hope put into words, it's just thrilling ! The music is beyond words, very well put together !
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series, while not sharing complete fidelity with the book, was really enjoyable to watch!  Casting of characters was outstanding.  The translation of the book's words into the series' visuals was mesmerising.  Tried to pace ourselves to one episode a week, but we couldn't wait and finished the series much too quickly!
B00CM03H4C|1.0|too comical, commercial & strange (maybe 2 good songs) very good bands and musicians, too bad it didn't come together ?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I came across this book due to a recommendation (People magazine plus some others). I am glad I bought it for several reasons : great storyline, multi-dimensional characters, and an examination of conscience. What does one do? Is the right thing always the best thing?<br /><br />I won't spoil it for you, but do read. I think it's worth your time (and money).
B001E8WNNO|5.0|JUST FANTASTIC. MY FAVORITE MOVIE. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE LOVE IT. THE FURY IS MY DREAM CAR
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Characters depicted with humor. Witty repertoire. Once again, Joss Whedon has excelled. This director's diversity never ceases to amaze me.
B005F9TQ9C|3.0|about this reissue.  This album is OK but really pretty boring.  I saw a film about Bob Dylan's trip to England.  In it, a reporter asked him what brought him to England.  Dylan's response was &#34;money&#34;.  I suspect the motivations for this reissue and all the generated vapor around it are similar.
0739367676|5.0|What 20 words can I say about this except that book #4 didn't let me down.  Good listening for those of us, like me, who really don't like to sit and read.
B0012IWHDW|3.0|I got this album because it was cheap and to round out my collection.  It is not one of his best but it has its moments.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my title says it all! great game! just would like it if it were possible to win more tokens at a time instead of just one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works flawlessly, cross platform support, and so simple.  Sets the tv and computer free of the chord, doesnt draw power from the controlling device.  Sweet.
B00338QENI|5.0|amazing read...highly recommend..learned facts about her specific case that applies to all of us when we are having surgery & biopsy is going to be done..
B007N8RULO|5.0|So much more fun and complicated than solitaire. Quite addicting to play as levels are completed. With each draw of the hand, the game subtly shifts.

B00CF2UORK|5.0|Like Pingu but fun for adults as well - one of my favorite shows - child feels the same way that I do!
B001FB563E|5.0|This movie made me cry so hard. The film is quiet but the essence of it is so rich! Despite the odds, they kept on moving and did not lose Humanity. I want to give this 5 stars because this film will become one of those I will never forget.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like that it can be set to different ringtones, and even more importantly can be set to start softly and increase volume gradually if you don't hear it at first. can also set time between snoozes - even set to shorten time between snoozes gradually. No more neededing to startle myself awake, but yet still does wake me up. IMPORTANT TIPS make sure the volume on device is on fully. Also I made silly mistake of setting alarm and then used earphones to listen to scriptures until asleep, earphones fell off while asleep and app tried it's best to wake me up through those little earphones laying next to me to no avail.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't understand the author. Reading book is suppose to have layers for the characters...Amy is un like able, spoiled brat, entitiled little girl and Nick is a whimpy man at the start and stupid at the end. What is the point of the book?  A woman scorned and let me show how I get back at you? Yes Amy is smart and clever however she uses it for all the wrong reasons and the wrong way. Typical marriage stuff.. Except Amy is a psycho and this book could of saved Me  time and money if it just came on Lifetime and and I just ignored it!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Been getting ads constantly over the last few days. Really annoying! Have to view ad every time I switch to a different menu screen. Makes the game much less enjoyable. But other than that, my son and I love this game!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire HD and it works fabulously. You can have many different alarms and set each alarm with its own chime or song. It has the ascending option (that I absolutely love) and a \\"max volume\\" setting, in case you don't want your device ascending to grumpy-stage of sound!<br />I recommend this, definitely.  I use this when I need to get up for work or to wake the childrens up for school, and it hasn't failed me yet.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|A first class 'walk through' of Steve's life. Enlightening and while he appeared difficult, it was more frustration. Pity he didn't accept the experts opinion until it was too late.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan offers a compelling analysis of historical evidence and the Gospels and thereby exposes the fictional and ideological nature of the New Testament.  He has performed an invaluable service for all of humanity.  We can only hope that the historical record will ultimately triumph over the fanciful wish fulfillment of fundamentalism.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|The Personal Amplifier works really well. I gave one to a friend & it worked so well, I got another one for my daughter. They do the job & helped them hear. Having ear pieces covering one's ears does get too warm after awhile, but that is to be expected. But, to be able to hear has been wonderful for them both. My daughter got hearing aids just as the amplifier was in the mail to her. And the hearing aids enable her to hear so well. But, those tire her ears too, so, in the evenings watching TV etc, she switches to the Sonic Sound Amplifier. This gives her ears a rest & works very well for her. These are excellent, & the cost is so reasonable it makes them affordable & well worth it. Thanks.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's not to bad of a game if your bored. It goes by pretty quick and isn't complicated. I'm not a fan of the trucks and buses
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|a lot of work with no results. I was never able to manifest anything simple. that's all I have to contribute.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Pretty cool combat and running experience with good graphics and REALLY easy controls plus it has all my favorite characters like Donnie Mickey and dog pound oh and one more thing...BOOYAKASHA!!!
B000FC1K66|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the book for a long time. It didn't disappoint and gave even more substance to the characters-a sad but fulfilling book to read.
B009ZM74F8|5.0|This is one of my favorites that I own both on DVD and Unbox. I love the action sequences, they use what I call Gun-Fu; it's like the old kung-fu fights I enjoyed as a kid, but only with guns. Extremely entertaining. There's only one nit to pick: the plot has a few holes, but if you don't take the movie too seriously, it's very enjoyable.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I've been a Paul Simon fan for years and have many of his albums. This latest offering doesn't disappoint and I feel is certainly his best since Rhythm of the Saints and that goes back some ways. All the tracks are great and some are incredible.<br />Product arrived in good time and in the condition described. Thanks.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|I love everything about this movie: the music, the action, and the story. The gist: a group of specialist enter a man's dream to convince him to break up his father's empire through a process called inception. Leonardo DiCaprio is a dream architect who can't create anymore because of the tragic death of his wife, and his projection of her enters the dream world causing havoc. Complicating things, he has been charged with her murder and has flown the US to hide abroad. A rival CEO approaches DiCaprio to perform inception. If he succeeds, the charges will be wiped away. You have to watch closely as the movie deals with dreams within dreams within dreams and if you don't pay much attention, you'll be lost. But, an exceptional movie nevertheless.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Great double cd and dvd. Came in good time and was in condition as described. Doesn't disappoint-has some wonderful new songs.
1449410243|4.0|You know what it looks like, it looks like the Oatmeal comics. It's fun to sit and read while three cats stare at you, waiting for dinner.
1465012796|5.0|Bought this for my friend as a birthday present.  He opened it up then and there so I a was able to look at the pictures.  Yes, they're all really good pictures.  But none of them are stand alone.  Every month is more of a bunch of pictures photoshopped together in a haze of Taylor Swift.  It all looks great, but if you're a fan of one single, awesome photo per month, this isn't the calendar for you.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Can't remember the last time I purchased a cd and was so captivated by it. From the creative lyrics, to Mike Rosenberg's unique delivery. This CD just makes me HAPPY!
0375842209|5.0|This book should be read by everyone.  I did not expect to love this book as much as I did.  An absolute must read.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|Exciting, fun and full of suspense! It was a great ride! I highly recommend it if you love a thriller!
1400052181|5.0|What an amazing story.  I am so glad Henrietta got the recognition she and her family so deserve.  I am so proud that the author took the time to let this story be told.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a beautifully written novel.  The characters are flawed humans that you can't help but love and admire.  Wonderful.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Must buy for all Star Trek fans out there, great movie to enjoy, great combination and little twist from past movies.
B008Y78M60|5.0|During a time of reactionary emotions & actions, the life of a widow who owns a boardinghouse, has her life forever changed because  of the men she boarded.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Now I know why I have heard of this movie for so many years.  Outstanding action, tension and realistic handling of WWII U Boats.  Almost forget they were the bad guys
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I heard about the show and decided to watch it. Had to become a Netflix subscriber though. I figured that I would binge watch the show and then cancel my subscription after the month. Still a subscriber.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|It was hard to get interested in the characters. I really liked the first one of this series but this one left me cold.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|When I first got this, Google did not have an IOS set-up app in the App Store. I tried setting it using the on-screen instructions and via the Web without any success. I was about to return it, when luckily the app became available. Once I had that, it took a couple of minutes and I was ready to watch Netflix on my TV.<br /><br />I didn't get the free Netflix trial with my order, however, and I ordered it as soon as it was available. My brother ordered his a week after I did and got the free three-months deal.
6305558167|5.0|By far the best adaptation of the Arthurian legend ever made. The actors are perfectly matched to their roles, all giving strong, impactful performances. (Many current stars appearing as young actors: Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne) The writing is intelligent, witty, incisive, with no trace of melodrama or cliche. There is so much story covered here the film moves with a rapid dramatic pace. The only flaw: So much back story to certain key characters (Percival and Lancelot e.g.) had to be left out to cover what the movie does so well. The soundtrack (Carmina Burana is a major theme) and cinematography are excellent as well. Maybe the best film John Boorman's made.
B00EVLU2F2|5.0|By far one of the best albums they have released. Reminds me more of their first album than any of the others.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|This package doesn't seem to be robust in the sense of &#34;cannot load tweets at this time&#34; on a regular basis.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Each track stands on it's own! What a fantastic young artist...can't wait to hear more!!!! I hope she will have full length album soon.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I often use my droid tablet to analyze customer networks and this is handy to find what systems are attached to the network.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I like the versatility of changing the color plates and it's compact, sleek design.  It does not get snagged on my pants pocket so its always easy to handle.  I would recommend this product again and again.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|For site surveys and making sure of channel usage this is one of the most useful tools I have installed on my cheap polaroid tablet.
B000J2BRQU|1.0|Seriously what was the point of this movie???  The rest of the series ( and I saw all 6 movies as of 2013- should get mother of year award for that alone) was ok if you like that sort of thing or you are a 14 year old boy.  But this installment was lame!  Couldn't the producers not cough up enough for any of the main characters??  Oh well, watch this movie is your are 14 year old boy or trying to win a parenting award.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|This is an easy method to access the storage on my polaroid tablet without directly connecting to the computer. Easy to use.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie was too short, too much back story was missing, and mostly just felt rushed. Based on the reviews I'd read, my expectations were more along the lines of the Second Coming. This barely counted as one. Still, the young actress was decent and the beginning of the movie was excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game :) this game has been exciting for me to play and is never boring. I would recommend this game to everyone going and old!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I didn't see that coming at all.  Great end to an awesome series.  Recommend to anyone that enjoys epic fantasy.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|We love the movie.... the only &#34;bad&#34; thing is that it didn't come with spanish audio. :( I needed it with spanish too... the movie is awesome.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A deep look into the hidden character of the players in this expertly crafted drama. I could not put it down!
B006P0FIGU|5.0|arrived  in a  reasonable amount  of  time. I  was  happy  to  use my  Amazon giftcard to complete the purchase!  so  glad  to  have  one  of  my favorite  movies... couldn't find it  in  stores.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought it was well written and held your attention. The story came together well in a way that was unexpected.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Less about the law and more about the lawyers, each trying to out maneuver the other, and the maneuvering happens everywhere with everyone. Good thing the characters are interesting.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|As usual problem with only getting a small portion of the book..but charged for it not once but twice pls take care of this
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has strings of options one can choose to create the perfect soundscape. Love the sound of a gentle rain? A crackling fire? Wind chimes? Ocean waves? These options and many more are included in the free version. Click the sounds to create as lush or spare a soundscape as is pleasing at the moment. Save it for later or pitch it when finished: either way the sounds are clear, the controls and timers are intuitive, and an aural oasis is never more than a few clicks away.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. And, it's fun! Just wish it were slightly easier to obtain more land, but still great.
B008GJVEZ2|4.0|If you like Boardwalk Empire you'll like this early Coen Brothers movie. Buscemi even has a minor role in this one. This is down dark and dirty without much humor, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable period piece and hopefully reminds you that the good old days weren't always good. Far from it.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|This program forgets my \\"to-do's\\" faster than I do on my own. I spent hours entering over 25 lists into this program, only for it to un-check half of the tasks I had already marked as completed. This occurred after the program deleted half of my lists which I spent an extra hour to re-enter. This is highly unfortunate since the program setup was exactly what I was looking for to manage my work. If the app could actually save the information entered AND successfully sync to google (which it didn't) I would have no complaints. Hopefully this is just a glitch that can be worked out, but I won't be taking that risk again.
B001SZ2Y4G|5.0|The Coen Brothers rising, Combines humor, drama, period style, in a python-esque social satire. Watchable over and over. See Tim Robbins feckless schmuck succeed to reach great heights in business without ever understanding why only to have his mentor/nemesis played by Paul Newman, slip him the weenie. He laughs he cries he plunges 45 stories but does not splat.
0765334798|1.0|I expected much more from this novel, I am completely disappointed. Also, I have impression that similar story was told already ie. watched sci-fi movie with similar idea.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie brought me to tears. These tears were not tears of any sadness or suffering but of pure joy. Then I pressed my finger on the play button. I then could not believe my eyes as I was taken through this adventure throughout the universe. The intensity of what was coming next gave my dog a heart attack but I had no time to take him to the vet until I had read every name of the genius creators of this movie of glory. By then my dog had passed to the next life and I didn't care because I was already halfway through watching it a second time. Glorious just Glorious! I suggest that after  you buy it and the second it shows up at your door you should have your popcorn ready and your running shoes on so you don't waste a second sprinting to put into your DVD player.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I watched it and I was like &#34;wow, that was a great movie!&#34;  I even stayed awake past 10pm to watch this, that says a lot.  Didn't have a bunch of cussing or nudity either, it was just good.
B008JFUO36|2.0|Do not waste your time watching this movie.  Great movie if you are having trouble falling asleep, or if you want to do something else while the movie is playing. Slow, boring and only watchable because of the special effects. If it were not for the special effects this movie would be worthless.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is a book that starts out slow, but gradually picks up. You need to read the first few chapters, then things will start making sense and you will not put the book down.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|My roommate absolutely loves it!!! I got it for her birthday and she listened to it 4 times within the first day or two that she had it! :D
B00506NRBS|5.0|I loved this book,it straightforward and interesting. He has a very unique,positive and motivating perspective on business . I really enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Excellent chick-lit. I found that I actually cared what happened in these women's  lives. None of the heroines was despicable or unlikeable -- just women coping with difficulties as best they can.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|I have multiple gmail accounts but cannot figure out how to use this to be able to view all of them from this application.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|the author of this book is one pompous ass, he belittled other peoples near death experiences while going on and on about how his experience was so perfect because he had the perfect disease.  Look him up online before you waste your money on this trash.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like it, the ability to search by category is a great help. I use it for multiple searches and my wife doesn't understand how I can utilize my Kindle this way.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is simple to play by by no means easy. Go too slow you get stuck. Go too fast and you will flip. It is a challenging and entertaining game. I am addicted to it. Try it and have fun.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|love it a lot it is the best I have never read a book this good I really good love it
B003G4W49C|5.0|I didn't know anything about this story beyond the description in the summary and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns. The author creates memorable characters and an engaging plot. Five stars for not being just another predictable work of adolescent dystopian fiction.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Like the book only it doesn't tell much of anything. There are questions no one has the right. Answer for. So where does one go for the answers.
B00B2EWNWG|2.0|This movie wanted to be like a original Chinese Kung Fu movie, but fails as it seems to strange to watch. The action and fights scenes are okay. The story is really weird to watch. It seems like they just threw in a bunch of old kung fu movie cliches in and made a not so believable movie. It is defiantly a interesting watch, but only if you have a lot of free time on your hands. Also, you have to have nothing else to watch, otherwise, you might want to pass on this one.
031620157X|5.0|My daughter follows the show \\"Glee\\". The author of the book Chris Colfer is a cast member of \\"Glee\\". He writes during his breaks and off times of the show. The book The Wishing Spell is imaginative and very creative. My daughter has both of his books and loves them both. They are both very colorful and are good reads.
076790592X|5.0|Juat another book required for school, so it's difficult to write a menaingful review that is going to help anyone make a decision.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is addicting. The best run game out there. The graphics are great. The dialogue is cool. Just a AWESOME game.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|this movie as suspenseful and kept me guessing to the very end. It definitely surprised me and the tricks were amazing to watch. Has a great moving plot line and held my interest from beginning to end.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|the soft ware has no instructions so i am unable to use it. Where do i get directions on how to use it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is by far the best TV show I've watched in ages.  I watched seasons 1-2 on &#34;on demand&#34; cable and then figured out how to hook up to Amazon Prime to watch Season 3.  I'm anxiously awaiting Season 4.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love everything by Lee Child, the Jack Reacher series is the very best. Would recommend to anyone, love it!
B0087ITBT8|5.0|I loved this movie, that my wife, and I saw, a bit of a while ago, because I love Barbra Streisand.  She is good in anything she does.
B0026SFEW8|4.0|We decided to watch this movie because we realized that our 15 year old son had never seen it. As we watched we came to the conclusion that this was the &#34;High School Musical&#34; of its era.  It's a good family film, although it does contain a fair amount of sexual innuendo.
B005LAII4E|5.0|I watched this movie, when i got it, and I found the action, and special effects, to be outstanding.  The Rock is a very character of mine.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I cannot tell you how disappointed and angry I am that after finally breaking down and paying for a game I am UNABLE to access it UNLESS I AM LOGGED INTO AMAZON!!! This is UNSATISFACTORY!!!<br /><br />I have very patchy internet and lately it is down far more than it is up, which means it's kinda hard to be logged into something on the internet.<br /><br />I also have no interest in being forced to &#34;Log in&#34; to ANYTHING to access something I've already purchased!!!<br /><br />I will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from Amazon's android store again because of this!!!!
B00DQVST76|5.0|My wife, and I just watched it last night, and we found that she put on a fantastic  show, with videos, and unbelievable dance arrangement.  She is a very talented woman, who still loos, very good, and can really perform.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A good character and the story flows well from scene to scene - A book I would recommend to readers of good action thrillers
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I am a Star Trek fan, and this movie was a very good restart of the series, I was so found of in the past.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I don't have cable or satellite & only watch DVD's. I initially came across Castle by accident & was hooked. I have all 5 seasons now & season 5, in my opinion, was the BEST yet!  This season finally ties up some loose ends we've been waiting for  the last 4 seasons - like who killed Kate's mother and who is Castle's father.  There were some good laughs and good suspense. The show is very well written & a real joy to watch. Very entertaining. I'm only sorry I have to wait another year for season 6 to come out on DVD.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|...in exchange for a five star review. And if giving in to the incessant request for a review will end the annoying pestering to review it. So far... it's decent. Not particularly challenging. Not intellectually stimulating. I do like the fact that this isn't HO to HO. It's more Myst like... minus the challenge. Not sure it's a 4.99 game. But since u had to purchase it to play longer than 20 minutes, and since I had no recourse other than to try and review it before finishing it just to be able to enjoy it, my advice to you if you love puzzle adventures, is play everything else first. Then - if there's nothing else left to play - then pay the premium price for a mediocre experience you may not be left alone long enough to enjoy.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I have enjoyed Fairway Solitaire as you have  many opportunities to develop strategy and not rely on pure luck.  There are times when only luck allows you to win, but most of the time you can affect the results yourself.  That is, until I reached the level I'm at now.  I apparently relied to much during previous levels on being able to purchase clubs and now am out of money and there is no way I can win unless I can purchase them.  Apparently I had my fun and now will be unable to continue to play.  I can't win to earn more golf bucks and I can't win because I can't buy clubs.
B001TKD4ZI|3.0|Book was good and the characters were interesting.  Doesn't look like there is a true sequel, so I wasted my time learning to appreciate the characters when the next book is a take off on a different character introduced in this book.  I like series with several books about the main characters, not pseudo spin off series.  Won't be reading anymore books set in this world.
B00138H876|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dylan albums, along with Desire (the 1974-1975 era), with classics such as &#34;Simple Twist of Fate&#34; and &#34;You're Going to Make Me Lonesome When you Go&#34; as well as of course &#34;Tangled Up in Blue.&#34;<br /><br />Great stuff!!
0399226907|5.0|I have read this in my daycare for years and it is always a favorite. I bought this one for a baby gift to help build a toddler library.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cant wait for more levels!! it was fun! I was challenged some but able to figure it out. I will look forward to updates
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It seems like a neat little device but I can't get it to work properly.<br /><br />The youtube app works but I can't get it to play Netflix from my tablet or my computer.  That is a problem considering that is the soul reason I bought it.<br /><br />I called Chromecast support and they said there was a known problem with the device and my router (which I'm not sure if I believed).
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|Great animation.  A good story for kids.  Would recommend it for families maybe around Christmas tie since Santa Clause is featured.
B005GVA2L0|1.0|Yep, Evanescence went mainstream with this one. It's a shame since their original sound was beautiful and unique in a world of auto tune.<br />Maybe it's just the synthesizer that is never turned off throughout the entire disc that is to blame. Without the synthesizer perhaps some of the beauty of the singing, lyrics, and guitar/drums would be able to make it's way through.<br />I was very disapointed because the previews of the tracks sounded wonderful, but now I can tell that they were timed to cut off right before the dreaded synthesizer kicked in. Wonderfully deceptive of whoever did that, because you sure rickrolled me.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I found the movie a bit confusing and somewhat trite.  The first GI Joe movie was much better which is why I decided to rent this one.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Not really a book for your kids.  Allegory where thought provoking ideas are expressed in a less heavy handed manner through animals.<br />There are defiantly sometimes you wish they weren't animals though.  This book is hard to put down, both because it's entertaining and occasionally quite grizzly.  Think of Animal Farm.  This book is not a waste of your time.
B0084670FU|3.0|I enjoyed all the actors, but found the story maddening and a bit boring because once again the Mexican people are mistreated and taken advantage of because they are seen as having no feeling and not deserving of respect.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Gripping story, genuine acting - highly addictive! Truly must see television-puts boring, predictable  dramas to shame. Recommended without a single reservation.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Lots of blood as to be expected with a Tarintino (sp?) movie, so somewhat unbelieveable.  Jamie Foxx is a good actor so why did he agree to be in this movie?
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love music that can move my imagination. This CD is wonderful for a quick escape into my favorite story.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I found the visuals interesting and the storyline somewhat surprising in places, but it was still a typical Tom Cruise movie
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple calculator and does what it needs to. The large display and buttons makes it very easy to use.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book really keeps you on the edge of your seat. It did for me at least. I highly recommend this book.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|I saw this and i thought this would be a good one to choose but when i got to build it was simple i looked at the box and then i thought wow this is better than the box picture it was a simple to build toy and drove very well rotatable turret and very detailed soldiers only problems were that the structures point fell off easily and the small container that said push up didn't even open when you pushed up it just had no effect and we decided to leave it disconnected and the only way to open it was  to use a tool and squeeze it hard any way it's still one of the best halo cars/warthogs I've got recommend it for any one that is a okay builder.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I'm so glad I downloaded the free Weather Channel app on my kindle-fire! I love it, and I can see the Florida thunderstorms as they build around us!
020161622X|3.0|Pragmatic programmer is one of the most preachy programming books I<br />have ever read, and this without offering any substance to the<br />preaching. The principles talked about in great length are sometimes<br />extremely simplistic , such as \\"Think about your work\\" -- of course<br />you should think about your work; it's programming after all, not<br />tightening screws in a car plant. These principles are bolstered with<br />childish stories everyone knows, such as the frog in the pan, which<br />have no relevance to the programming craft. At the same time, the<br />authors avoid discussing the real tough problems that software teams<br />face, such as dealing with incompetent managers who apply pressure all<br />the time, and take no responsibility when defects start cropping.<br /><br />The age of this book, written in 1999, also shows, because of the<br />specific nature of examples chosen. For example, the authors write<br />about using a 'scripting language' such as Python or Tcl/Tk to<br />prototype before moving on to a 'real' language to build a working<br />version. This distinction has long been superseded, scripting<br />languages (which aren't called even that anymore; they are now called<br />'very high level languages') becoming some of the most popular tools<br />for all kinds of software. Accordingly, the examples and longer<br />discussions are mostly C++ and Java-oriented.  The authors sometimes<br />argue for things that could be due to the one and a half decades that<br />went by, but I doubt whether there was any discussion at the time<br />either. Examples for this are using Notepad for programming, and<br />syntax highlighting in an editor. These are the most primitive topics<br />in programming, and don't belong as discussions in a book that deals<br />with topics of object-oriented modeling a few pages later.<br /><br />The authors are also dead wrong on two fronts, in my opinion. One is<br />their self-confident argument that a programmer should learn a new<br />language every year. How can a programmer who has so much experience<br />as the authors claim something like this? Really learning a language<br />does not only mean learning the syntax and reserved keywords, but<br />understanding the paradigm and idioms of the language, and the<br />facilities of the underlying platform. What the users should have said<br />is \\"Learn new programming paradigms\\". The imperative paradigm is<br />overrepresented in today's industry, and looking over to others such<br />as functional or logic languages certainly improves a programmer's<br />skills.  Jumping from one language to another each christmas, however,<br />will only lead to half-baked knowledge of the logic operators of<br />different languages.  The second topic where I think the authors are<br />wrong, in my opinion, is their defense of code generators. To be<br />perfectly honest, if you need code generators to keep your code base<br />concise and clean, the language you are using is simply too limited,<br />and you should consider some alternatives.<br /><br />The reason I'm still giving three stars despite my criticisms is that,<br />except for the mentioned two topics on which I think they are<br />completely wrong, the authors don't write nonsense. Although the tone<br />is so preachy and content simplistic, most of what they say is right.<br />There is a time to read this book, just like there is a time to read<br />Enid Blyton books: At the very beginning of your career, when you<br />can't even touch-type. But then again, just talk to some experienced<br />teammates, or read a few classic posts from programming blogs like<br />Coding Horror or Joel on Software (or better, read all their<br />posts). You will learn much more about building software, and that<br />while being entertained and not feeling as if you're being treated<br />like a child.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game when your board. Fun and graphics are really good. Could give less time when doing things so your not waiting so long. But I love it.
0345803493|5.0|This book was everything and more. If you haven't started the trilogy you have to start immediately. A true love story.LOVED IT!!!
0812982622|5.0|This well written book belongs with &#34;Darkness at Noon&#34; and &#34;1984&#34; as a fictional tale of  a totalitarian state and the behaviours of people it creates when all coices are bad.
0345803507|5.0|I hated that this was the last book. But it was so good. It just show more love between Ana and Christian. I loved all the books. Have to read them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is Awesome those who uses it on kindle fire just don't let it sit there when you aren't using it it will freeze
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This is a great concept, at a great price, and when it works, it works very well. Unfortunately, it's capabilities were recently reduced by software changes from Google, and it's not clear if or when it will be able to live up to its potential.<br /><br />I already have media servers on my network, and can play most content on at least one TV, but it's sometimes awkward. I was hoping this would be a simple solution to allow me to play web content and locally stored content easily on any of my TV's--even the &#34;non-smart&#34; TV's. So far it's not living up to that.<br /><br />The good:<br />- high quality video (when it works)<br />- low price<br />- flexibility, except where limited by firmware and lack of app support<br /><br />The bad:<br />- refuses to play locally stored video content (e.g., my own camera-shot videos, recordings from DVR. Apparently, it was capable of this until late August 2013, when Google reportedly deliberately disabled it via a software upgrade<br />- since flash isn't supported on newer Android devices, &#34;casting&#34; most web videos from Android requires a specific app. Only a few apps are now available--YouTube, Netflix among them. Amazon Instant Video doesn't work.<br />- flash videos can be &#34;cast&#34; from PC's, but it loads the CPU heavily--requires a fast PC, and even then, my laptop runs hot and noisy while doing it<br />- Google music refuses to cast music stored locally on an Android device, even though it will play it on Android. (??)<br /><br />Long story short, I think at this point most people would be better served by a more &#34;full featured&#34; media device, such as a media PC. And those who already have that won't get much more from Chromecast. The price is attractive, and the future could be very promising, but for now I think most people would be better served by a different solution. Maybe apps are in the works to restore the missing / broken functionality, but for now, it does less than half of what I bought it to do.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Basically you just draw lines to get sugar into cups, but at the heart of this game are really great logic puzzles.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|A superb rendition of a fantastic rpg. The joystick was arguably a little clunky at times but still fully functional. The game is well worth the cost, even more so when it goes on sale! Watch f or it to be discounted and don't miss out.<br />Also, no in game purchases so it has the rare benefit of not being a pay-to-win game and thus is not designed with intentional annoyances you can pay extra to avoid. This single handedly helps the game be substantially better than other RPGs.
B003M6EAXM|4.0|If you like the previous 24 seasons you will like season 8.  It had been a while since I had watched s7 so it renewed my enthusiasm
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I use this often it wonder I thank the kindle company for sending this to me I don't know what did before I got this
B000W7JWUA|3.0|I really enjoy playing Settlers, but when I figure opened it I realized it only had enough pieces to play with 3 players, even though the box says 4 players.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|One of the top all time enjoyable games... Have been playing it for 10 years or so, and still find it enjoyable, build your own park, no two are ever the same.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Thought it would be funnier, but it was heartwarming and fun. Made me miss the days my son and I spent following the jetski circuit hauling around his machines.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|I will give them credit for trying, but I found this movie pretty dull for an action/horror flick. The book was infinitely more interesting because the story came from multiple perspectives and it tackled the more complex social and moral issues. The movie, on the other hand, was pretty straightforward. Brad Pitt runs around the planet trying to save it and succeeds in a time frame that is far too short to be even remotely interesting. Even the scenes that were pumped up for the trailer turned out to be dull and predictable at best.
B00122N0MU|5.0|Great sounds! I didn't know how versatile Mark's music was! Emmylou's voice to this collection is heaven sent. A real bargain if you ask me!
B00112ASXK|5.0|I bought this, along with the mare and foal, for my daughter's birthday. She has been playing with them on a daily basis. I thought the coloring would have started smudging a little by now but it hasn't. It's a nice, small size. Perfect for smaller hands.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|but not worth the hype or the price. You went from a competent genius to a bumbling neurotic. The movie was jerky and tried to cover too much so gave little depth.
B0002HZSE4|5.0|We bought this, with the stallion and foal, for my daughter's birthday. It's a small, nicely painted mare. It fits perfect in my daughter's hands.
B00CUKTGJO|5.0|This is not a Live CD.. It's a Studio version of what was played Live at the Casbah Club in Brixton, England July 10th, 1982..The Best of The Clash, if You will..<br />  For $10.00, You can't beat it..The Remastering is great, The Bass has been boosted, and the Guitars and Vocals are a lot clearer than on the old LP's..  5 out of 5 Stars from this Clash Fan..
0738711500|5.0|first time with tarot,do not know much, but these card are great. be looking forward for her next book thank you
B000VI12ZS|3.0|Ho-hum. Lots of action with the predictable and usual WWII story characters surrounding the leads. Not too much CGI over-load like some other war movies.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|bingo blitz is not my favorite bingo game but ok. I would recommend it if you like to play bingo
B001NHNG64|4.0|This book keeps you on edge the whole way. The first Jack Reacher book was a little bit better as a mystery, but this one ups the level of the reader's anxiety. The only way to calm your nerves is to keep reading!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series! There is science fiction but not too far out!  Really enjoyed the spunk of the main character.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|My copy was perfect.  Not sure what happened to the European copies.  Thank you Amazon for bringing M to my big screen!!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The actors portray these old characters that we love and know so well that it is as if they were back on screen, reincarnated into a new generation. The action is fantastic, the special effects really know how to support a good story rather than hinder it. J.J.Abrams really did a fantastic job with this movie. Truly I recommend this movie to all Star Trek fans and Sci-Fi fans out there.
159562015X|5.0|Great book to read if you are not aware of your own strengths. Helps you identify your strengths and work on them!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and easy to use. My kids have been able to figure it out. I would recommend this to other users because it is so simple.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|It's going to be hard for you to put the book down.  In true Zafon fashion, you'll find yourself cheering on your favorite characters!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It is a very fun thing to spend time on, however it could use a little bit more options that are not locked.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a really fun and funny game that i love playing. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves or wants to see the movie
1575666286|5.0|Extremely important for anyone trying to gain optimum health, regain health or fight a terminal disease or chronic condition.  Easy to read and follow.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Easy to navigate around the game. Graphics are good. My kids have fun with this game. They love the movies too.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Good basic trainer. I am glad they d<br />ecided to make one. I have not used the connected service yet but have used their Pc version.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We were late to catching on to this phenom, but now we're all in! Just started Season 3 and excited to see where the story goes.
0345525558|4.0|Well written, very interesting, well-developed characters, makes a person think about the lasting effect many foster homes/orphanages have on children.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|very fun and entertaining.  my son got it and he enjoyed it  a ton. i can't wait for another update
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love this app and so do my Grandchildren, tough time for me to have Kindle time! Addicting, challenging and fun
B00821OX98|5.0|I always passed this by on cable...so glad that I found it on Prime.  Some frightening sci-fi elements, but at heart, a character-driven program.  Really enjoying watching the growth and development of the relationships among the members of the Second MA.
B00D8H3Q2G|5.0|Like many others, I've loved this movie and soundtrack for years. I was excited to hear that a newly mastered SACD of one the incredible music was going to be made available, and from an audiophile company no less.<br /><br />I've read a couple of reviews here that say that it's not SACD because it doesn't have surround sound (which is just ignorant), or that the sound quality is inferior to previous CD versions. I can't account for how someone would come to that conclusion. When the SACD layer is played on a properly configured SACD player, this disc is in another league compared to any previous Blade Runner soundtrack release.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the sound, but this disc exceeded them. Dynamic range (loud vs soft) and frequency response (highs to lows) are both markedly improved. It manages to simultaneously render the individual sounds and the space around them with more clarity and yet create a more cohesive overall soundstage. In short, it's a different experience. The disc manages to take you deeper into a recording that you may already be very familiar with and starkly reveals how incredible the music and production really is.<br /><br />I didn't listen for very long to the CD layer of this disc. It's created from the same remastering and sounds better than the previous CD, but the benefits I describe are far more apparent on the SACD layer.<br /><br />Especially if you have an SACD player, this SACD disc is very highly recommended!
B008KW43TE|5.0|Frank absolutely gave me a great R&B album. Huge R&B fan and so thankful a great writer like Frank exists.
B0072V394E|2.0|I stopped counting the dead. Wonder where all the bullets came from?  If the bullet  were in the coffin he dragged across the country he must have been the strongest man in the world. Franco Nero's \\"Django\\" embarrassed spaghetti westerns or was it a good example of the genre?
B00003CXGG|5.0|Gone to soon. A great actress in the making gone for something so crazy.. This movie had a great storyline and great action. Jet Li brought it. Aaliyah was everything we expected her to be!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app and it was free<br /> I like the new minion beach.  I hope they. continue to add new worlds.
630514415X|5.0|Denzel brought it in this movie. I love the fact they had a real basketball player play a hooper in a movie.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was ok.  I am not a big fan of girls acting older than they are but the music was great and we enjoyed the movie.  Plus the music was just coming out when we watched it so we heard the songs on the radio and my kids could get it from Itunes.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Day bow bow, chicka chickaah. I need 15 more words so here they are and stuff yea thanks and stuff.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I like mid evil settings so this movie was easy to like.  It entertained and held my attention.  I liked it.  A movie I would watch with my family.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I got addicted to the Game of Thorns series after hearing about the HBO series.  I do not have. HBO so I decided to start reading the books.  I was taken immediately by the characters in the books.  I love how Martin chronicles his characters in chapters.  I am not one who usually reads fiction but this series has taken me away!  I highly recommend.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Tennet is my favorite doctor and Donna is the best mate...funny, flip, and fabulous!  I watched the entire season in three days.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app all the time to check the temp, radar, and all things weather related. Quick and easy! If you want to keep up with the weather, use this app.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|The game itself is pretty good but when I tried to go on it said that it had an error.  Then I tried again and the same thing happened.  Because I own a Facebook account I tried going on a different kindle but when I logged onnto my account it didn't work.  It only worked with other counts. The worst part of alp is that I was a lack20 and I had the blue boon dragon
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|The game is fun but some levels are very repetitive. Only 3/5 heroes are free and the other 2 cost a lot of money to buy. Not the greatest app but definitely not the worst
1400052181|4.0|The overreaching theme of this book is bioethics using Henrietta Lacks and her story and her children's story as the fuel to keep the story moving.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I ordered this movie for my son who was having a difficult time finding it in stores. What a great surprise for him to receive it for his birthday in August! He can now watch anytime he wants to and it doesn't have to be in December!<br />Thank you Amazon!
B003VPWXRO|4.0|I was a fan of Ally McBeal in the 90s when I was in my 20s, and I recall wondering how the stars stayed so thin. I wanted to be like them. Little did I know how miserable at least one of them was. The only thing I wish there was more of in this book is how she handles it now. Does she still struggle with body image now?
B000HL09SA|4.0|One of my all time favorites!  Makes one think of their very first pet and how much you come to love them.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|This one isn't as popular. The younger grandkids cant play as well. My 14 year old added these games to my kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like this product, but haven't been in habit of watching YouTube videos so really would like Hulu support to be added.  That said, the product is very easy to use and I would highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Once again my grand kids added this game . They all play this one often. The younger ones play easily.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is yet another game added by the grandchildren They all cant play this as well. Not a good choice.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I thought this device could replace Apple TV...with it's low price, I could buy several units for different rooms...Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the video quality. The video is not HD Quality...Im quite sure it's not my internet connection. I hope they can improve this device because it has potentials...for this price point, your getting a good deal, no matter what...
B0035LGXXO|5.0|You owe it to yourself to watch this. I've never seen a movie about a group of kids getting from point A to point B be so interesting. Good acting, good fights, good drama--this movie has withstood the test of time.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Delightful with plenty of action, deadly serious moments and absolutely laugh-out-loud scenes.  We loved this movie the first time we saw it and watched it again a few months later with our daughter and enjoyed it every bit as much the second time.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|As expected, season 2 is just as addicting as the first season. Love this series and hope it goes on for more seasons...
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The first 45 minutes are very entertaining. Visually stunning, good story and pacing. But a spaceship crashes and so does the movie. After that the story is all over the place with conspiracy theories and slow pacing. I started looking around for something else to do while the movie was playing.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I really enjoyed it, especially when it goes from 2D to 3D.  It was very well done and my son loved it as much as I did.  I really liked it because I could relate to it, having been to many an arcade back in the late 70's and 80's.  Buy it, you'll like it!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Advertising says you can view your phone on your tv. Not quite. What they forget to mention is that the Internet you access on your phone via 3G or 4G cannot be cast to your tv. The only way chromecast works is when your phone is connected to a wireless signal that is connected to the Internet. Current advertising leads you to believe your phone communicates (casts) its Internet access to your tv, not true. There is no option for 3G (or higher) Internet access to be cast. Would have been a huge change if it could cast 3G or better service instead it's just another google hyped disappointment.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I found it hard to put down and was sad when I reached the end.  It is to bad that slavery is part of our history, this story gives us hope that special relationships between owners and slaves were possible and meaningful.  Let us all learn to be compassionate toward those who help us.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is really fun and cute to look at. it is a challenge to play. cant wait for the new movie to come out.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|I didn't know DVDs came in only full screen any more... I should have read closer. I just assumed that the Anniversary addition would be wide screen.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was a good read. Very English. The story kept me reading long after my bed time. Somewhere between childhood and adulthood the lines blur, things are never quite what they seem, and if you allow your mind to open, you may just find that the world is much more complex than it first appears.
B0055HVDZ4|5.0|Listen to vol.4 said it !!!!, hey get this put it on and party .Sometime's a bands early work is their best as described here, I love paranoid and iron man but this album just sets itself apart. I've converted many but we still have work, Listen to vol.4 today.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Provocative and insightfully done, a great help to those who search for meaning in their lives. YOU GOT TO READ IT!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A thoughtful and provocative analysis of What Jesus's life could have been under Roman rule.  Earlier today I visited the archeological site at Sepphoris which Jesus probably worked as a construction worker. I am writing this review in Nazareth close to where Jesus grew up. Having just read Zealot before coming to the Holy Land, the book very effectively helps a 21st century visitor envision what it must have been like at the time of Jesus.
B005HSL626|5.0|I freakin' love this game!!  I can sit there forever playing, just like a small child.  Fun and entertaining.  Good download.
0307949486|5.0|You will not be able to put the books down!!! Non stop action with wonderful characters. Hated that there wasn't a sequel. You won't be disappointed.
B002OLE1XU|5.0|Just love this series.  Nothing more to say, just awesome.  Looking forward to the next movie!!  Can't wait till Fast 6 is out on dvd.
B00632HWOG|5.0|For all of yahoo's issues this app runs really well.  You can set up all your different accounts in the same place which is really handy.
B003ZLV8T8|5.0|I just love this movie.  I rented this on a long trip and it definitely kept me busy!! I could watch this show over and over and over again.  Very satisfied!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this book. I love the style of the author. She makes it simple and fun. I look forward to hearing from her again soon. Thank you Ms. Grout.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love Twitter.  The app is the same as my smart phone.  Love being able to continue my social media accounts regardless of the device I am using.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Excellent production values, wonderful director and outstanding actors make this one of the best fils ever produced.  Like Citizen Kane, Wizard of Oz, The Sting, this film will only get better with age.
B000002KDS|5.0|Alice Cooper was the first to don black make-up (sorry KISS), and to me remains the definitive dark rock band.  Others have followed (KISS), but none have recreated the magic of Alice Cooper's hard, angry rock music and dark imagery.  I mean, &#34;Dead Babies&#34;...teen bliss!  And, no, I've never bitten the head off of a snake or hung myself.  I let Alice act it out for me.  Actually, thank goodness for Alice Cooper... LOL
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Love this game. I like that you can play people from all over the world and a great way to practice the game of pool. I found that after a while I couldn't get an opponent until I linked with face book.
0425252868|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It is one of the best books I've ever read and would highly recommend it.
6304458223|5.0|My 10 year old nephew was thrilled when he watched the DVD.  His parents enjoyed it as well.  Being based on a true story was a definite plus.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a very nice dumb TV in the bedroom that I wanted to get Netflix on. This answered the problem perfectly for just $35.00 and it opens up a wealth of shows from YouTube. Simple to use with a phone, tablet or laptop and it gives us a crystal clear picture over the FIOS network. This is a brilliant device that puts the world of video at your fingertips even on a seven year old TV. If the TV has a HDMI port this will make any TV work perfectly on your wireless network. Do be careful as the Chromecasting service is so good that you will spend a lot more time watching first class shows you never looked at before. It may also make your current TV service look shabby in comparison. This is the best gadget I have ever bought for $35.00, what a steal.
B000NMW6M0|1.0|Dont waste your time..I will never get my 3 hours back.  For most of the movie the stories make no sense, then when things start to connect, it's really not that interesting.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|This movie has a good premise and storyline. However, it didn't live up to my expectations. The explanations were to confusing and the storyline left to many gaps.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|great. cant wait for more. i wish i knew when the next two books were going to be out in stores.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the first half of this novel. I wanted to love the second half. *spoiler alert!: Once Amy went back to Desi's place, it kind of lost a lot of steam for me. Good read, though.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful story, brilliantly told from the perspective of numerous narrators. This book is a great read for anyone who enjoys well written, beautiful stories.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The audiobook is better, but they did a good job. I have a hard time not critiquing a movie after I read the book. If I had seen the movie first, I would have loved it. But I don't really get why they changed some of the things from the book when they made the movie. Oh well. Still well worth watching!! Highly recommend the audiobook! Best audiobook I've ever read.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Stupid, formulaic, and a waste of time and money? Dont succumb to big name stars. The special effects rate the two stars I reluctantly give this. Who determines the stars for Amazon, anyway? Usually pretty off base, and this is no exception.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|When I click on the star rating system the first one states I hate it. I absolutely hate this album.  Who do these guy's think they are? Putting out the finest heavy metal labums of all time and then to come out with this...?<br />  I started hearing this on on Ozzy's boneyard on xm/sirius or what ever. I have to admit the tunes I heard absolutely rocked. Finally broke down and bought this on vinyl. Could this live up to the hype that the satelite radio had been giving it? On that fact alone I was very skeptical.<br />  Not only did it blow my expectations out of the water, I was willing to give this a free pass becasue after all this is Black Sabbath!! But it, again is pure heavy metal to the finest core. Get over it if the 1 star rating kills you, but this album is a 5 STAR from the first listen beginning to end.<br />  As if we needed another excuse to buy it other than the fact that it completely floors me when I listen to it.<br />I LOVE this Lp. Please refrain if you wish to shoot me nasty comments.  5 Stars isn't enough, so it has to be a solid one star. If you are on the fence, why? heavy metal has kicked you in the arse with this and it would be a crime not to get it. Word up.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I found out after starting reading this book that I had read it long time ago but I enjoyed reading it again.  Unlike most of John Grisham's book that the  main character are lawyers this book is about a young man that buys a newspaper in the south. Told froom his view of some unusual characters and of course it has to have a trial and who was on the jury and what happen after a few years.  Good reading
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I follow many blogs and it os nice to have them all in one place. When the have a new post I have it on feedly I don't have to go to each one and see if they have an update. Saves me time! I recommend feedly!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game is just plain fun.  I would have gladly paid $0.99 it had it not been the FAOTD.  The developer took a few concepts we all are intuitively  familair with and made a very entertaining game.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like the different things going on in the game, graphics are good. Kids love it would tell others to get .
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like this game because I can play for a long time without having to make any in app purchases to keep playing
0062068423|5.0|This  Harry Hole book set in Norway takes a bit to figure out what's going on, but once you start its hard to put down. The story crosses between WWII and the turn of 2000, with connections between the eras that remind me of the film [[ASIN:B004YM2YCC Dead Again]]. The characters are complex and interesting, and it's hard not to get engaged in the plot and the characters. I'm going to work on reading the rest of the books in the series now.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I saw the movie years ago,so I knew the basic story.The attention to details and the twists in the story provided high drama.I could'nt read it fast enough.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Where to start... OMG!!!!!  Start watching and you'll be hooked.  At first you'll think, oh, another show...and this one is about a serial killer who kills bad people.  Even if that doesn't interest you, watch the first episode and you'll thank me later.<br /><br />Probably one of the top 5 series I've ever watched in my life!
0061900656|4.0|Happy how quick this came, and enjoyed reading it to my Grandson who will be a big brother soon. Thanks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE this game.  Awesomely challenging!  Some clues are easy to find but others are a bit more tricky.  Very addictive!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|While I've always considered myself an extrovert, I live with some very profound introverts. I picked up the book after listening to an author interview. The content of this book is sooooo eye-opening, and challenges many of the ways I've looked at my world. The irony is that I do have many qualities of an introvert that I did not previously understand. The research referenced in this book is fascinating. The ideas are well presented and provocative. Clearly the author comes from an introverted bias (my only &#34;complaint&#34; if there is one) but the concepts here will leave you pondering long after you turn the last page.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I love this product.<br /><br />I can assure you.  This heatsink and fan may look daunting to install?  but it doesn't take more than 15 minutes.  you can't mess anything up.  there is no way to break anything.  Ha!  That's a huge bonus.  Installing a CPU heatsink & fan, is the hardest, and most anxiety-prone part of building a computer.<br /><br />I am soooo happy that COOLER MASTER was able to deliver me a product (212+) that. when used with a single fan? is incredibly effective, and also more quiet than any other cpu fan I've heard before.<br /><br />After some reserach? I don't think it is worth the $$ or hassle to install a 2nd CPU cooler. like the heatsink in the picture?  that has two cpu fans.  My reserach says that the 2nd fan mount is a waste of effort.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|This game is awesome to play, I recommended anyone who like racing game to play this game. It free Try it.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought the google chrome assuming that it would not work in my country Colombia. Well, it works perfectly... i can see netflix movies, and use the youtube app... i have not been able to download the app from the app store, because it only sells in the USA, but i have not needed it.<br />Totally recommend it!!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|love playing solitaire, it is one of my favorite card games because at least I get to win once in a while.
B0086213XW|3.0|Although I can easily understand why some reviewers would consider the leisurely pace and meandering dialogue of this movie tedious, I found that aspect of the film endearing and convincing. Certainly there are many people in real life who act silly or make warped jokes in private, so for me this aspect of the film added to its realism. I also admired the acting and found the main characters for the most part appealing.<br />  There are two reasons I will probably not watch this film again. First, if you liked seeing Kathy Bates nude in ABOUT SCHMIDT, you will love the scene in this film with variously-aged nude women in the pool shower. Enough said.<br />  Also, I felt that any appeal in the attraction between Margot and Daniel was completely undercut by the montage of threesome scenes after the two finally get together. How incongruous that seemed, given the tone of the relationship up to that point, particularly the moral angst evident in Margot.<br />  All in all, a thoughtfully-written film with a few grotesque disappointments.
B009CGGHL4|5.0|The funniest comedy horror movie made...and slacker themed to boot! The first in a trio of comedies: Hot Fuzz and World's End are the other two...
B0035HKWM6|5.0|It is hard these days to find a PG-13 movie that I can watch with my kids, so it was nice to find this classic fun movie.  My boys loved it, and it moved along a enough of a pace to keep their interest.  While romance is involved in the plot line, the references are clean for the most part and when they happen in a cartoon like fashion, my kids just thought it was funny.  Great rental.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft. But if your new to minecraft  PE IS the way to go. It gets you used to minecraft before getting the game. It is also useful because<br />If your parents aren't going to get you minecraft this is a very fun game<br />For now.<br />Mogang is a very good company and minecraft is probably more than they expected it to be.

140006922X|4.0|I listened to an interview with Reza Aslan on NPR and became quite intrigued, so ordered this book. I wanted my own copy in order to highlight and write notes on the pages.  I am only a bit into it, but love the forward and general tone of the author. He seems to strive for an honest, unbiased author's voice which I appreciate. It will be interesting to see if my personal views and faith will be altered. Certainly as a reader, I welcome new information and am eager to learn.<br /><br />I am now half way through Aslan's book and recognize a consistent bias through his word choices. He is an associate professor of creative writing, after all. You'll have to form your own opinion once you have read the book, but do pay attention to this. One example on page 88 is that John the Baptist \\"admits' he is not the messiah. Aslan could have used the word \\"stated\\" or \\"proclaimed\\" but chooses to imply a sort of guilt and hidden agenda. The book seems rife with implications of bias through his wording. I noted in the infamous Fox interview seen on youtube, that Aslan asserts often his twenty years of experience, but does not mention that his \\"four degrees\\" are not all in biblical history. Be that as it may, it was quite interesting to learn of the political world of those times. My hope is that Zealot does not sway too many new believers in a negative way. Fortunately he does state in his Author's Notes that \\"For every well- attested, heavily researched, and eminently authoritative argument made about the historical Jesus, there is an equally well- attested, equally researched, and equally authoritative argument opposing it.\\" Hopefully readers will not skip this part.<br /><br />The book is reader friendly and interesting. However, a better title may have been \\"Dismantling the New Testament.\\"
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Creepy. Like the others I didn't like the ending but I also know not every story has a happy ending. Yes I slept with the lights on just in case I woke up with a bad dream.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is awesome you can crash into other players!  It's got real tracks real cars I love it!  There's even multiplayer I gave it 5 stars!  But beware it takes up a lot of space because of the great graphics.
0743243153|5.0|This book was written many years ago.  I felt so fortunate to have found it.  Never forget about Amazon when searching for a product.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Excellent story.<br /><br />This was so well written.  What a gift has been given to<br />Mr. Lee Child. Thank you.<br /><br />I truly could hardly put it down.

B003U6BE8I|4.0|Good movie for both adults and kids. Entertaining, but not an all-time favorite. Followed the book for the most part.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I love him, love almost every song he has performed, and wish he would be coming to Houston soon, so I could see him perform live.
B00EEN7CAK|5.0|I thought this movie was fantastic, Emma Watson did an amazing job playing Nicky and so did the other actors. I love how it has a good message about choosing the right friends and making the right decisions.  Great movie.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I enjoy listening to this CD, but I wish the cups version was the full version of this song, then I would have given it 5 stars.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This book has all the information you need to get started on the 5:2 eating programme to help you on your way to losing weight and hopefully getting healthier. Easy to do.
0547366205|5.0|I love this book!  Mem Fox is known for her delightful books for very young children.  The books are full of repetition and rhyme helping to develop essential pre-reading skills.  The illustrations are of children from many countries and walks of life &#34;who, as everyone knows, have ten little fingers and ten little toes.&#34;<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Love this movie! we wanted to see it in the theater but never made it. Well I recently purchased a 55 inch Samsung (F6400) which, while not like being in the theater, was still great. There is are so many twists and turns and a surprise ending (OK, maybe a little predictable if you pay attention) that had us intently watching the whole way through. I would definately recommend this to everyone!
B002DD67XG|5.0|Always loved his music and this CD fit the bill.  He sings a lot of remembered songs and plays and sings to some I have not heard, it was great.
0307352153|4.0|Not what I usually read, but better than expected. Would recommend to anyone interested in history and culture. Read it.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|I saw this in the theater, I couldn't even last the whole picture I walked out. The guts of what made star trek great are gone. I challenge anyone to watch the original wrath of Khan and compare the dramatic acting to this. and the sex thing with the Vulcan - tried that already on the tv series star trek enterprise, that one didn't last to long did it? what's left here is just the candy outer casing of special effects but the inside is hollow.
1451695195|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. I would especially recommend this book to anyone who doubts there is a God. No one can disclaim Dr. Alexander's experience of dying and going to heaven.  It is factual and absolutely wonderful proof of heaven.
B000QUUD60|4.0|It was good but it didnt have the funny scenes you can see on youtube. All in all its still pretty good.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A mix of sci fi, comedy, and thoughtful issues of how we view ourselves and our interactions with those around us, including aliens.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This movie really kept my attention shocking at all the twists hard to believe what people can do to get what they want

B0060V1WJ6|5.0|very easy going light funny movie relaxing and could follow it well enjoyed watching it and left you feeling good after watching
0345529057|5.0|I do not usually read this genre. But my son got me started with this series. It is awesome. These books are of paperback quality and seem to be holding up well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its. a. great.and very challenge game.  Anyone who get. this. game. will. like. it a lot. I like it a lot
B004X2M3N8|5.0|So I absolutely love Doctor WHO and this is no exception. The quality was amazing and it was super easy to download to my computer. Its a lot more convenient for me to get the episodes than buy the DVD and have to wait for it to come. Instant gratification, I suppose.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|You can download it for free and it's a very fun game in my opinion! But I can't find the king crab:(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun to play love the sound effects and just love the minions to pieces. if you like the movies you'll like the game
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It's the morning after her cousin's bachelorette party in Vegas and Megan Scott wakes up with the mother of all hangovers. Even worse, she's in a stranger's penthouse having woken up with something else as well--a funny, arrogant, sexy...husband! Megan wants a lawyer. But Connor's shocking bombshell? \\"I don't want a divorce.\\"<br /><br />Megan has been wanting a baby but after being hurt in past relationships has decided her best option is to use a sperm bank to get what she wants. While having drinks with her cousin and the other bridemaids she spots Conner walking past their table to have drinks with his friend jeff.<br /><br />Conner is now at the table alone after Jeff leaves with the cocktail waitress when Megan walks up to him asking to leave together to get the other girls off of her back and so they don't follow her out. Conner agrees but only if she will sit down for ten minutes to try and make it really convinceing to the ladies. After a night of drinking Megan and Connor feel a connection and decide to get married. Megan doesn't remember much from the night before and is ready to end things before Conner and her come up with a plan for a trial marriage that could end either way.<br /><br />I loved this book and would recomend it to anyone that loves romance books. It was a quick read for me. I got so into it that I was staying up late and telling myself I would put it down after one more chapter. Well that one more chapter would turn into two more and then three and so on. It was very hard to put down once I picked it up. I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars. I would deffintly read it again and really wish Mira would make a series out of this book. I would love to know what happens where the book left off.
B00459EZLW|4.0|I love science fiction, though I like quirky shows with humor. If you are expecting this to be like Stargate you might be disappointed, it is darker and bleak at times. Though the characters are complex and not easily put in good or bad categories but grey.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book held my interest quite well after a rather slow start.  Everyone in my book club enjoyed it, too.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|The author makes good points, but some points are a stretch and subjective...perhaps a lot like art. He loses a bit of steam when he talks about the greatness of Lance Armstrong. He may want to revise those parts.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|THis is a great movie, a great story and a time appropriate message for us in America today with our leaders all imagining themselves to be prince John.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I converted what DVD's I had to blu-ray's, and never looked back. Without a doubt, it is a sublime format. This particular title is far superior to the DVD.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|I don't know why I watched this movie.  I knew that they were not going to get the same actors back and that the movie would be disjointed.  I guess it is a link to my childhood obsession with the toys.  Not worth the money.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|fun fantastic game recommend this game to everyone. get it get it today what are you waiting for. cant go wrong with this one !!!
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|I thought this movie was good but not as good as the first of the reboot.  I am sorry they did not make the story line their own and borrowed so heavily from the original time line.  I especially thought there were some terribly corny moments which could have been more subtly done.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I seem to have trouble getting the info from the lay out on the kindle  prefer to go in and look on the big computer.<br />however I will keep it and use it when away from the house.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|it is just a zombi movie.  For some reason I thought pitt had higher standards than that.  I don't know why
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this one game I did not get into.  probably just my taste so was deleted  thanks for the chance to try it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It was all I could think about for days!  The unexpected turn had me glued! Definitely going to check out more of this author's books
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Another winner by Michael Connelly. Very worth your time and good story lines that you expect from Michael Connelly. .
B00000IQW5|4.0|I quite like this film and do not consider it a low point for Spielberg.  I find it very romantic and very much worth watching.  I only wish it would be released in Blu Ray.
B00846REIS|2.0|Not much action and I could not get through it. May appeal more the opposite sex but for me it did not work.
B004UXUX7S|4.0|This is a very engaging movie, with some very funny moments, yet also very touching.  Another movie that I count as being enjoyable enough to watch it from time to time and still find it a good movie.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|SUUUUPER MOVIE EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT .
B00867GHS8|5.0|I cannot live without this movie.  From 3 months old and on, when my son is fussy and I can't figure out what is wrong, all I have to do is put this movie on and like magic, he is glued.  It is magic and I am thrilled it comes in 3-D.
014241493X|5.0|First of all, forgive me. I wrote this review in list format, which is what I do when I don't feel like putting together a whole string of paragraphs. I had a lot to say, and I like making lists.<br /><br />I believe that this is the first John Green book I've ever read. The first time I read this must have been in 2009 because Will Grayson, Will Grayson took awhile to release afterwards. I immediately decided it was one of my favorite books ever, and it still is. It may even be my favorite out of all of John Green's books. You may ask, \\"What! What about The Fault in Our Stars?!\\" The truth is, Paper Towns feels more special to me because not everyone is scrambling to get a copy of it. As far as I can tell, this book is not going to be turned into a movie anytime soon. Paper Towns feels more special to me than TFIOS because so many people say they just love that book. This book holds a special place in my heart, and part of that is because I don't see many others saying it's special to them.<br /><br />What else about this book makes me love it? Well, let Me count the Ways . . .<br /><br />1) The beginning was fantastic. I love how it started out with the miracles and how Q and Margo find the dead guy before going to present day.<br /><br />2) Literary references and tie-ins. I especially liked the one with Moby Dick, though I've never read that book. Part of why Q was so obsessive with finding Margo was because he was supposed to be obsessive, just like the guy in Moby Dick.<br /><br />3) Interesting side characters. Ben was a little crazy. Radar was cool. Lacey was a nice addition to the group, both as Ben's girlfriend and Margo's best friend.<br /><br />4) Details like the black santas and RHAPAW just make the book all the more better. They were like little inside jokes between the characters. They made friendships and connections more special.<br /><br />5) This book just . . . so profound. It made me think of all sorts of profound things while reading, which weren't really profound at all because I suck at being profound.<br /><br />I could go on with counting the ways . . . wait . . . okay, Here's just One more:<br /><br />6) I just love the whole idea of the book. It was about a guy that fell for a fantasy--an image he wanted to see--a paper girl named Margo Roth Spiegelman--without even knowing who she really was. It was about a girl that everyone saw as a legend running away to discover herself--to feel real, instead of just another paper girl that she felt she was. It was about a girl who fell for a paper version of a guy who turned out to be much more than that and a guy who fell for an almost untouchable legend that turned out to be . . . a regular girl. Most importantly, it was about really, truly getting to know another person past the appearances he or she puts on.<br /><br />This book strikes a cord--a string, if you will--that just moves me every time I read it. Every time I finish it, I feel like I'd just witnessed something fantastically profound. I love it. That is why this book is one of my favorite novels.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|The 3D is great on this DVD. If you have a 3D TV, it goes without saying that this DVD should be in your collection. I only gave it four stars because there is an issue with selecting 3D vs 2D on the disc I received.  When selecting one or the other, it is impossible to tell which one is being chosen as the icon doesn't display differently, so you just have to hope you get it right.  I am not sure if it is production wide or just my DVD.  I should have returned it, but I didn't actually sit down to watch it until months after I had bought it.  Other than that, all I can say is this movie just makes me smile.  in 3D.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love this app!! It has been a great help with school and home work.  I highly suggest it to teachers and students
B0071BY1PG|5.0|The kid loves Kung Fu Panda next to Finding Nemo.  I am so glad they had it in 3-D.  It has been fun watching these with my son.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Very limited functionality. There is no radar. No hourly forecast. No graphs. Basically you can pick a location and it will show you one page of information about the current conditions and forecast for the next week.<br />There are free apps that are much better.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|I am not a 3-D critic.  Unless it is really crap, I like it.  Needless to say, I thought the 3-D was good and I love this trilogy.  So glad they had all three in 3-D.  It has been fun watching these at home with my son on our new 3-D TV.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The relaxing combinations are endless and you can taylor them to your every mood. My 5-year-old grandson enjoys it as well.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved the way Moyes took two people from very different walks of life to weave this story. The book got me to think about truly handicapped people and how hard there lives are. I never gave this subject much thought. This book made me really open my eyes as well as bring many tears.
161655164X|5.0|The book was great condition. It had no scratches or tears whatsoever. The artwork was sharp and beautiful, no smeary ink or anything. Would definitely recommend!

B00EEXST2K|4.0|very entertaining and amanda seyfried is one of the most attractive and talented actresses in hollywood.  I don't know why it didn't make the first run theaters
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|The value of this boxed set will only rise in value as time goes on.  I believe it's a limited edition. BUT that's not the main reason to buy this.  The main reason to buy this is because of being able to listen to Harry Nilsson.  I defy anyone to listen to the \\"Moonbeam Song\\" on Nilsson Schmilsson and not regard it as one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded.  What many listeners may not know is the fact that all the other voices backing up Harry as he sings are, in fact, Harry himself.  He was one of the first masters of overdubbing.  Harry Nilsson really had two musical periods.  The first period ends with \\"A Little Bit of Schmilsson in the Night\\".  What follows has moments of greatness, but not of the same caliber as before.  How did this happen?  Harry literally ruined his voice and at an fairly early age.  He smoked a lot, not good if you're a singer, and his drug and alcohol use are legendary.  AND he KNEW what was happening to his voice.  He stated that he made the \\"A Little Bit of Schmillson in the Night\\" just in time.  Of course his marathon excursions with John Lennon ended up with him actually singing so loud there was blood on the microphone when he was finished.  This may not seem to be appropriate for music I'm giving a 5 star review to, but it is very relevant.  I will state, and any Nilsson fan like myself I think would agree, had he stopped smoking, limited his drug use, and taken better care of his voice, he would have become one of the all time greatest recording artists in history, ranking right up there with Elvis, Frank Sinatra, anyone you can think of.  I have never heard a voice like his before or since.  How tragic is what happened to his voice?  Buy the DVD of \\"Who is Harry Nilsson...\\" and watch when Jimmy Webb, an important song writer himself and friend of Harry, TRY to talk about what happened.  Jimmy Webb had to stop because even 17 years after Harry's death he still couldn't talk about what happened to Harry's voice without crying.  But Harry the recording artist and song writer and Harry's personal life led to one of the saddest episodes in music history.  If you are still reading this I will tell you that if you don't want to take the time to listen to all of this music just listen to \\"Nilsson Schmilsson\\" and \\"A Little Bit of Schmilsson in the NIght\\".  Those 2 cd's alone are worth the price.  And if you want to hear a good cover a Nilsson song, listen to Micky Dolenz sing \\"Remember\\" on his latest album.  It is sung from the heart by one of Harry's best friends, Micky Dolenz.  How good was Harry as a singer?  John Lennon, Paul McCarntey and Ringo Starr all said he was not only their favorite American singer.  He was their favorite song writer AND MUSICAL GROUP!  And this was before any of his hits were recorded (Without You, Everybody's Talkin' at Me, Coconut Song, Jump into the Fire).  When 3 of the Beatles, arguably the greatest rock group of all time, state you are their favorite, that's all you need to know.  If this boxed set is a limited edition I am telling you right now that within 5 years it will be worth 10 times this price.  Do yourself a favor:  buy this box, listen to the music and wonder how Harry did it?  All the voices on his recordings, especially in that first period of time are HIS!
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|From my six year old: Loves the repair games and that it has a drawing design feature, but it's still good for younger players. From Mom: can't go wrong the Dr. Panda's apps... worth the purchase.

B00EFNXPFK|5.0|What life in Montana was like is really causing John to keep digging into the root of the music styles his career has always orbited around. Whether its blues, folk, country or Americana rock, he's still doing it, but at a more fundamental level.<br /><br />So why listen to this? Because he's able to distill his music from being production oriented to lyric and music progression oriented. And its done masterfully. I'm a huge fan of Continuum and Heavier Things. After truly absorbing this and Born & Raised, in my opinion Paradise Valley in the top 3 albums of his career. It isn't quite Continuum everyone wants, but the maturity of his lyrics and the chord progressions are exceptional and, for me, just edges out Heavier Things.<br /><br />Some fans want the same old thing every time. Few bands last when they follow that formula. I'll happily follow Mayer's career as long as it continues and he solidifies his place among durable, evolving legends like The Beatles and U2.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Best ear candy I've bought in a long time. Perfect blend of Old West feel and the stories they tell in the music are awesome and alot of it is based on actual events and people. It's a perfect progression in their style and vibe that Volbeat brings.
0307476073|2.0|What I did like was the adventure of the story. What I didn't like was Cheryl. The story is called From Lost to Found, but she only reached her destination. Yes, she finally accepted her mothers's death, but she couldn't be honest with herself. She was a heroin addict and wouldn't admit it. She is slutty and gross, but excuses it as &#34;thinking like a man&#34;. Cheryl is a flake who seems to disregard the feelings of others, just to achieve/acquire what she needs. I could of read another adventure story about the pacific trail and probably enjoyed it more. For an author who wanted to lay it all out there and be raw, she wasn't very honest with herself or her readers.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this calculator. Being an older person, it's so easy for me to use and I use it a lot.
0345803507|2.0|The editor of this book seemed to have fallen asleep. Probably during one of the redundent sex scenes. The dialogue is so repetative. I kept hoping that Anastasia would leave him for good or he would would realize what a wet noodle she was. The characters were unlikeable and the &#34;story&#34; laughable. I am sorry I wasted brain cells on it.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like the game - it's fun to play and you can actually WIN sometimes.  The graphics are good and I like the card backs.
B009POCFTG|3.0|This repulsive movie came from a repulsive play and it plays like a play in some regards. Not one character here is decent; except perhaps the son who at least tries to free his sister at the end . but even he is a grotesque person. In fact , what makes this movie so repulsive is that you just know that there are people really like that out there.  And this is about rotten trashy people that are the scum of society. At least the kids in this story have a excuse as they were raised by the monster of a father character.  I work in schools and meet people that frankly starve their kids for dope money. or worse abuse them etc, even pot heads can be that low. But this group didn't need drugs to be the lowlifes they are , they just are trashy people. And that's what the play is about. , however the ending is left , with a open ending that surely the play did better? well maybe  NOT!. IF you don't want to watch a movie about horrible people that will sicken your stomach , then don't watch this film. But it is ok as a strange study in complete familial dysfunction I guess.  If you can get past the ending. Mathew mconoanay is pretty chilling in his psychopathic role here. And he's the \\"killer' in killer joe. HE's A evil police and hit man. who , would be caught in reality eventually as people talk. and he's known to way too many people inthis film, Perhaps they should have made him a straight criminal , that would be someone that would be easiest to actually get away with murdering people . Anyways, unlike a horror film , the family in this isn't too far removed from a disgusting reality that may exist in your town. THis will leave you with a nice bad taste in  your mouth. Which is what they were trying to do when they made the film. SO on that level it's a success, I would say this is a easy movie to hate, or you can enjoy the parade of human garbage as they self destruct here.  And that's the goal. SO the movie is good at depicting what it wanted to.. This is not for kids though. It's a cult flick for sure. And it is watchable on that level for sure. But be warned , this is not for most viewers who don't like rancid stories about rotten people!.  There was a great song from the 1960's , by the kingsmen, (the guys who did the song \\"louie louie) called 'killer joe' , I wonder if the play writer ever heard it?  oh well...  this looks great in hd , but the film is set in just a few places , just like a play , so don't except , too much scenery!.though. It's a cult flick for sure. And it is watchable on that level for sure. But be warned , this is not for most viewers who don't like rancid stories about rotten people!.

B001HC8516|4.0|I loved the movie, so I picked up the book. I love the honesty that these writers share about their experiences. I'm not sure if it applies universally, but I know that in many cases excuses hold women (& men) in negative situations and that happiness is out there if they allow themselves to move on.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I cannot wait to start reading the next one! This book was really good, couldn't see what was coming! Surprise after surprise! Good good good!
B004SDEP38|5.0|Was a free download and works perfectly. I might have paid $5-$10 even if it wasn't free as it works very well on my Android device (Samsung Galaxy S3)
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|I really wanted this and when I read the user agreement I refused to use it. I wanted to features it offer, but don't want the legal implications. Please refund my coins...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a really fun game, I do wish there was more information about what the prizes and bonuses mean.
B000UZNRS2|3.0|You have the regular Camel Club and its plot going on in Washington D.C., and then there is this other story and plot with Annabelle and Jerry Bagger up in Atlantic City.  Why?  It added nothing but more pages and confusion.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is addictive and fun. This was money well spent. The scenery is beautifully designed. I like that if you die it lets you pick up where you left off or at least close to it.
B00DU74U74|4.0|The book was soooo confusing, but the movie was awesome.  The audiance really got to know both females.  I would recommend this movie to 17 yrs. and up.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie if you didn't read the book first. I think they left out a lot of information and description that let you become tied to the main characters. Overall it was a good movie.
B008MZPW1C|5.0|More often than we'd like to admit. an album from a present day artist would appear and apart from the hit single or two, the rest of the album is mere filler or the songs are all disposable clones of each other. However, sometimes a rarity like this one will come along in which ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD! and it becomes part of one's permanent collection, which will survive repeated purges of other albums as tastes and moods change. This one is a keeper.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I love mahjong, but this is more like a trial game; it doesn't have the full options that regular mahjong has.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I had heard about the book a few years ago and just got around to reading it recently. A must read!!!
B00ENCFCMC|4.0|SPOILER ALERT: I thought this season was the worst because the characters just didn't seem fitting.  I couldn't get over how they made Caesar seem like a sentimental follower.  And Laeta---just not deserving of  Spartacus at all!  The worst was Crixus' ending---he was ROBBED! However, I will say that the season finale was among the best shows of the entire tenure of the show.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|When Madonna finds out how horrible the picture is and how the 5.1 does not work on the right speakers she is going to be PISSED!<br /><br />I sure hope they are going to replace this with a working copy.  So many issues with menu system as well.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I cry every single time I watch this. Since I just got a new HDTV and Bluray player, this makes it look AMAZING!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great movie. I loved the first one too and can't wait for 3. The cast is a great mix of actors and really represent the Star Trek franchise well.
0399255370|5.0|A very clever story to add to any child's library collection. Adorably told and illustrated for children of all ages.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Revenge and loss of self worth seemed to be the focus of this depressing story.  Whatever happened to the inner strength of most people who have job losses and find new success in many amazing ways?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books are amazing! Not just because of the sex, but because of the story between Ana and Christian. So good!
B00ADQPA38|5.0|A definite improvement over the heavy-handed sexuality that hung over the entire first season, season 2 is beyond scary, beyond horrifying. That's what makes it so compelling for me. Jessica Lange will no doubt win another Emmy for her powerhouse performance, and the rest of the cast is flawless as well. (Poor Chloe Sevigny revisits what brought her such controversy in \\"The Brown Bunny\\" performing fellatio onscreen yet again...though of course only simulated here). The production here feels genuinely creepy, whereas I felt season one tried too hard to scare and shock. I wonder if, when I get the Blu-Ray, If it'll be like the first time i saw it: I was often holding my breath but never realized it until the commercial break.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was so bummed out by pretty much this whole book. It was weird and did not end the way I expected it to or wanted it to. Really disappointed that this was how the whole series ended. :(
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|Good game to test your reflexes.<br /><br />Instant re-spawn help with the learning process as you will fail numerous times to reach your goal (which is part of the fun)<br /><br />Only complaint are small hiccups/lag on first game at the start of launching the app each time, but seeing that each game lasts less than a minute, you can always let the first one slide
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very true to period times.  It shows the intimate relationship between a very old, wealthy aristocratic family and its multitude of servants in a medieval castle estate that is the center of the community.  The series starts with the sinking of the Titanic and travels through time thru WWI, the Spanish flu epidemic and into the 1920's with the changes in automobiles from horses to hotrods, fashion trends--women's dresses getting shorter--, attitudes toward the elite changing, the conflict with Ireland beginning politically.  It is like a British &#34;Dynasty&#34; TV series.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I wish I had read this book 20 years ago. It answer a lot of unsolved questions about my shaky christian faith. All of those questions are resolved now and my faith is stronger and more realistic. I think everyone interested in religion shold read this book.
B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|Some people, even some FF fans, are not giving this album a very favorable reception. I guess it's true that the album is not really remarkable or ground-breaking in any way. Most of the tracks return to the basics that made FF's first album so awesome, and this is not a bad thing. But there are a few new elements, including some retro sounds, so it's not like this album is just a clone of \\"Franz Ferdinand\\". All in all, it is a very good album but not one that's likely to get a lot of critical attention.<br /><br />I'd say that 7 of the 10 tracks sound pretty much like those on \\"FF\\", with some different elements thrown in for variety. \\"Right Action\\" is my favorite track. It is classic FF, with a steadily driving beat and strong bass. \\"Evil Eye\\" has a beat that reminds me of some earlier period, probably late 70's or early 80's. \\"Love Illumination\\" features a couple of 60's elements: some organ lines, and a fuzzy guitar that sounds psychedelic. \\"Bullet\\" and \\"Treason! Animals\\" are, again, pretty much classic FF. The organ is featured again in \\"Brief Encounters\\", along with an unusual (and loud) guitar solo. Likewise, \\"Goodbye Lovers And Friends\\" has some decorative instrumental touches.<br /><br />The tracks that deviate the most from the standard FF formula are \\"Stand On The Horizon\\", \\"Fresh Strawberries\\" and \\"The Expanded Universe\\". Nothing too radical, but \\"Horizon\\" and \\"Strawberries\\" sound more like mid-tempo pop songs than FF rock songs, and the latter has some 60's guitar going on behind the vocal. The most \\"different\\" track is \\"The Expanded Universe\\". It is quieter than the others, and it has synth \\"beeps\\" characteristic of early 80's New Wave hits. Also it has a guitar sound that is more \\"fluid\\" than FF's trademark quick, metallic guitar strokes.<br /><br />I always like FF's lyrics because, by being brief and cryptic, they say more with less words, and because of their quirky humor. In \\"Stand On The Horizon\\", apparently on the verge of committing to someone, Alex sings \\"I stand on the horizon/I want to step across it with you/But when the sun's this low/Everything's cold/On the line of the horizon.\\" The protagonist in \\"Treason! Animals\\" seems to be having a breakdown due to loneliness: \\"Hey friends when will you get here?/Hey friends I need to hear voices/I don't care what you talk about/Something has really gone wrong.\\" \\"The Universe Expanded\\" causes actions to reverse themselves (\\"Cork the wine/Unbake a cake\\"), including a relationship that goes backwards, from love to friendship to \\"happy strangers\\". And in \\"Goodbye Lovers And Friends\\", first there is bluntness (\\"Don't play pop music/You know I hate pop music/Just sing amazing godless grace/Don't wear bright colors/You know I hate bright colors/I never liked you for the way you dressed anyway.\\"), then there is a determination to end relationships without sentimentality: \\"Don't give me virtues that I never had/Don't get sychophantal...you can laugh as if we're still together/But this really is the end.\\" I hope that last sentence is not prophetic for us, the fans of this amazing band.Alex sings \\"I stand on the horizon/I want to step across it with you/But when the sun's this low/Everything's cold/On the line of the horizon.\\" The protagonist in \\"Treason!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was very moved to discover that the other side were humans also and had their own code of honor. It was wonderful that these two pilots found each other and made their story even more meaningful and available for history and mankind.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I expected more out of a movie starring George Clooney.  I thought the story line was flat.  Not enough to keep me real interested.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Overall, I thought the movie was great, but I am a little disappointed with the poor grammar in regards to the title. The way the title is written, \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" makes no sense and should be \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" instead. On another note, the disc and case are of high quality.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is super fun (if you're into the &#34;build a town, complete quests&#34; kind of game)!  You don't *have* to purchase anything, it just takes some patience to build up enough gems to get quest items in the game.  It's great how many of the fan-favorite ponies they include!
B003BA4CAU|5.0|Bring a box of tissues because it is impossible to hold back the tears. Gerard Bulter before he was famous, at least here in the US.

B006LXQID8|5.0|A love story with a different twist. It was so interesting. Managed to even understand much of the French. Too bad more movies aren't as sweet as this one was.

B0058BI864|5.0|Very funny show. I  especially like Sheldons character. Even though he's annoying and a smart butt, he's still the funniest.
B00A6SZRJ0|4.0|Good driving music. The only thing missing is &#34;Jump&#34; from The Power of Darkness. I might just get that on it's own.<br /><br />This album has the up-beat songs from TSFH, I don't like their horror songs, so this is perfect.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Believe it or not this game is highly addicting.  You and your kids will definitely enjoy this app. Enjoy enjoy
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I'm using this device with the iPad. It doesn't respond as well as my finger. I will continue to try it to see if it will work better with another technique.
B0026772N8|5.0|Helped me cope with daily pain by channeling the pain signals allowing me to not think about the pain causing the feeling of my pain to dramatically decrease while sometimes none at all, when before I had to use pain control.<br /> To understand zen allows one to appreciate all the small things in life for what they really are and not ignore the simple pleasures, making you more relaxed and a feeling of satisfaction in life.<br /> I have referred this read to all my friends :)
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Not really 4 stars but better than 3 stars so I had to give it 4.  If you're a fan of these types of movies you'll probably like it. If you like fast action sci-fi horror, it won't do much for you.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a superb story teller, and I immensely liked this first book of the series.  Looking forward to reading the next book.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater I knew I had to buy it on dvd. I'm glad I have it, HOWEVER, I would love to have a multi-disc version.
0321934318|5.0|This product totally exceeded my expectations. Love the program, especially useful for Sports Photography and the value can't be beat.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|My brother asked for this as a gift. He truely enjoys it! Each time I see him and talk with him he thanks me for getting it for him!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Great fun for Daddy and 7-year old daughters.<br />Sat on a blanket in front of the TV, popped pop corn, and enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />There is enough humor in this adventure for both kids and adults alike.<br /><br />It might have a bit more violence than some families would care for (guns shooting animals), but with a bit of discussion one can make this a learning experience, too.<br /><br />Recommended!
034580404X|5.0|I never thought a married Christian woman would enjoy this series, but she apparently does. There may be more to this whole series than I originally thought.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Best all around movie I've watched recently. Unique and interesting plot. A nice blend of action and drama.  Matthew McConaughey delivers a unique performance.

B004J09ONG|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen!<br />It has a moral for young and old and a tenderness that will reach your inner core.....
B009NYF2ES|5.0|A timeless epic of a most horrific period of history.  I am often bemused how caught up in the &#34;show&#34; and the dance that people often get while missing the poignancy of history. A Kander and Ebb score truly brings a &#34;book&#34; to life.  A must see!!!!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A great read! One of those books that makes you put aside your chores and say &#34;shhh, I am reading&#34;. Loved the way the way the unique story lines all intertwined.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Easy and fun. Relaxing music. Download took a long-running well worth the wait. . Isn't wait to do more. Beautiful colors.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I ask the question, which Matrix collection version are you considering because the reviews here are of mixed (different) collections available.<br /><br />I purchased a 6 disc Bluray version (currently listed by Amazon as: [[ASIN:B000OPPBEQ The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray]]) for about $25.00. I am very happy with this collection. This set includes the 3 (Bluray) movies, Animatrix (Bluray) shorts and the Matrix Experience (standard DVD) set which is 1 double-sided disc and another single-sided disc. These last (Matrix Experience DVD) discs include The Roots of the Matrix, The Burly Man Chronicles & The Zion Archive. I see these were all separate discs in the older (only DVD) releases of this collection set. Probably, with current technological advancements, they are able to include all this \\"data\\" on fewer discs.<br /><br />As for the movies, if you haven't seen any or all of them, where have you been? The original Matrix is an outstanding movie and the Bluray version really enhances it with clarity and full THX theater sound. The second and third movies are also enhanced in picture quality and sound although I didn't find either of their storylines as intriguing and thought-provoking as the original. Still, both worth seeing and hearing again in full Bluray clarity & resonance.<br /><br />I found the last discs to have some pretty interesting production info as well as commentaries and even what the chef would cook for the cast & crew while on location. Also, I laughed when Keanu Reeves was talking about some makeup work for the movie Revolutions and mistakenly said Revelations and kinda asked, what's the name of the movie?<br /><br />I'm not a fan of anime so I won't comment on that disc other than it looks well made (it is Bluray) with a clear picture and good sound. I guess the little stories can get you involved and can be enjoyable.<br /><br />The (cardboard) packaging is pretty cool (Matrix green data) with each disc in it's own DVD case, except for The Matrix Experience which holds the 1 double-sided DVD on one side and the other single-sided DVD on the other side of the DVD case.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good Matrix movie collection set with just about everything you could want to know about the Matrix movies, sets, and production.he Matrix Experience which holds the 1 double-sided DVD on one side and the other single-sided DVD on the other side of the DVD case.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good Matrix movie collection set with just about everything you could want to know about the Matrix movies, sets, and production.

B00ET47USI|5.0|I have played many a spider game and this is by far the most fun game i have ever played! Not only is it fun, it is so FUNNY!
B005FDW7AI|4.0|Brought tears sometimes.. though it was rather staged acting.. but touched the heart nonetheless. I would recommend kids to watch this to appreciate the gifts of life before we lose them. It was nice to see that the little princess was caring and sharing though she was well off. It sends a good message against bigotry and to be loving regardless of skin color and economic status.
1577314808|5.0|This was the 1st Eckhart Tolle I ready and I am so grateful that I found you.  This is one of those books that I will read over and over and over.  It is just that great!  I loved it so much!<br />Thank you, Thank you, Thank.  So powerful!
B00005JKGK|4.0|Not exactly a chick flick but poignant portrayal of generation gap and universal misunderstandings between mothers and daughters.  I imagine it would ring even more true if you were a second generation immigrant.  But although that does not apply Ito me, I wept intermittently throughout the movie.  Guys won't get it ... but women should not watch this before going out as your eyes will be puffy and your mascara will be a mess.
B001FB5634|5.0|This movie is pretty accurate and is successful in conveying the bleekness and hopelessness associated with trying to survive on an earth that is dying. The is successful in showing the desperation of the families, the depravity to which some with willingly sink to survive. The paranoia of good people when resources are short. Everyone becomes a Republican but for good reason in this environment where good will to strangers is something to be very suspicious of as a potential cause of death. Here you will see living but no life, just human animals shuffling about trying to hide from everything, the elements, starvation, microbiology, each other, their own doubts and fears.
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|Tired of being a ruler, Riddick (Vin Diesel) decides he wants to return to his home planet, only to be double crossed. In the first few minutes of the film Riddick displays his toughness by setting a broken bone in his own leg...then he puts screws in it. He makes friends with an alien dingo. Eventually he goes up against only eleven seasoned bounty hunters...and we know how that goes.<br /><br />The special effects were decent. The dialouge meets our tough guy expectations. Good mix of drama and action, with a touch of levity. The plot is very simple, Riddick vs. bounty hunters vs. alien creatures. Good popcorn film.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity (Katee Sackhoff + full frontal) sex talk.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|People just never change and it's proven in this story. The characters are definitely believable. Any Rand wrote a great work here that everyone can relate to.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Pre Ordered before it was released.  Received it when it was predicted AND i got a 40 cent rebate because the price had changed from when purchased to release/ship price.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|You can't put it down it's SO bad - but reading \\"inner goddess\\" over and over again for her internal thoughts - was SOOOO annoying! It didn't seem to fit with her character. Can't wait to be embarrassed in the theater watching the movie AUG 2014.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thought it was a good fun game. I enjoy most of the puzzles. I liked that it didn't ask for money to do the next step every time a new puzzle came up like some of the games.

B0063M22QO|5.0|Works well. Easy to use menu. Traditional game play. Recommend for any one who plays on their PC. Worth the 99coins.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Fun game but it feels like the others a where you can never accomplish a goal there is always something else. Other than that it's very cute and fun.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I don't know much about the Harry Potter universe, but the movies get better with each one I see.  Visually appealing, wonderful acting, great fantasy setting.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|Ok, Nothing great about it. Every episode the attorneys win a new case.  Never saw them losing. This girl suddenly views a paper flying by or sprinkler running etc and the next thing you see is that the case is solved.
1400164257|4.0|I grew to like this book.  The first listen through I gave it 3 stars, okay, not great. The humor is what pulled it through. But after a couple of listens I like it more now. I really like MP3 format so the entire book is on one disc!  I just wish the rest of the books were.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I really like Christian Bale, so I guess I'm biased from the beginning with these movies.  I do enjoy the the darker ambiance of these movies, which I feel matches with the idea of Gotham and the world that Batman comes from.  Heath Ledger as the Joker in the second film is one of the all-time great villains in my opinion.  Tom Hardy does a great job as Bane in the third movie.  Bale does a good job exposing more of Bruce Wayne's internal conflict and feelings about being who he is, living in Gotham, losing people he cares about...all the things that make us human.  Overall I think these are some great Batman movies, especially compared to some of the older ones.
0316228583|2.0|The story is slow and the print is so close to the binding that it makes it difficult to read.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I haven't been able to think about anything but the Immortal Instruments series (the first three books, so far) the entire week! My family have had to fend for themselves and work has been something I viewed as getting in the way of my reading. I am a fan and will read whatever Cassandra Clare writes. Her books are a rich tapestry of words woven together quite magically.<br /><br />Buy the series. Now. You will struggle to put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting I'm just constantly trying to level up. then when it says I'm out of energy I'm like NoOoooooo
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is so much fun and the fact that it's free IS GREAT. I would recommend this game. Fun game.
B00DOHLFZK|5.0|I have enjoyed reading these books so much on my tablet. I read them years ago; so they are old friends. I do love having them so easily at my disposal. Thank you.
B0035XQW74|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, it was given such great reviews by my friends. Downloaded it on my kindlefire and enjoyed this movie durnig amy plane ride. Great buy!
B00DQVST76|5.0|This tour was a magical , theatrical show from from dark to light. Madonna and her dancers do amazing choreography as always. Sound quality on the DVD is exellent. A must buy.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|A beautiful film in every sense. This film will endure for centuries. We loved it and will watch it again.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Daniel Jackson is back and gets some great character development in this season! I am enjoying this season a lot!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Bought these, read a few negative reviews about comfort and sound quality, not true. These are very comfortable even for extended wear, the sound quality is excellent. I have an amateur recording studio, I lay down multiple music tracks and then do a voice over recording while listening to the music. I have to hear my voice as I am doing this and these do the trick without contaminating the voice track with the music from the semi open design of the headphones. The price is great. You will love them.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. The characters are so well defined that you are drawn into their lives.  Highly recommend.  An excellent read!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Wow.  I wished I watched this movie in the theaters!  Loved it.  You won't regret watching this movie.  Enough said.
0765325950|3.0|This novel is a fitting end to the Wheel of Time series as a whole. It's a 900+ page hardcover book consisting almost entirely of military action and individual fight scenes. This isn't a huge surprise (it is the Last Battle, after all), but it just got tedious, especially since I so often ran into characters I didn't remember -- all of the Forsaken appear, but half of them have changed their names and I couldn't tell them apart to begin with; about 50 pages from the end a character appears for the first time in the book (and maybe in the last three; I remembered his name but could remember nothing about him); and there are so many one-off characters and name checks that while I was comfortable with the main cast by a few hundred pages in I wasn't sure if some of the names were new or backstory characters. The battle between Rand and the Dark One unfolds predictably (except for some details about the magical tools which I simply didn't remember) and the way it had to.<br />Many of the above issues are less problematic for those reading (or re-reading) the series with fresh eyes. Less forgivable are the character deaths. The novel is a bloodbath for the forces of Light, but in terms of the core cast it's shockingly light on fatalities. Many people die, some of them in a good depiction of the shock and randomness of war -- but others go into battle for a glorious sacrifice, make their sacrifice, and then somehow come out alive on the next page. It's frustrating.<br /><br />So, not a great novel. But oxymoronically, it does make me want to read the series again (or at least the first 7 novels, when things actually happened) in order to better remember what the quoted prophecies and some of the referenced events and characters were all about way back when.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's life.  It's the way life has always been.  Read your history.  Children have always used against the older generation.  I suppose it will always take the generation of Katniss, Gale and Peeta's age to feel the anger enough to risk doing something.  Old enough to feel the anger....to young not to know what they are really getting into.  This book is life, whether 2000 years in the past or 2000 years in the future.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow. I just finished reading Wool after starting it last night, and I am very impressed. The actual writing -- the sentence construction -- is merely average. The world construction is amazing and believable; the characters are fleshed-out and make sense without being stereotypes; the plot is thrilling, twists in all the right places, and even at the end feels totally natural for the world Howey has constructed. Having finished the novel I can think of other stories which share its elements, but even with those comparisons this one is totally original -- you cannot guess the ending when you start the book; you probably can't even guess the middle; but none of it feels rushed or like anything is being skipped.<br /><br />This is a sci-fi novel only in the sense that it takes place in the future -- all the science that is described or implied exists today. This is a novel about people and societies under stressors extraordinarily different from what they are subject to in societies today, used to explore the role of the individual and the responsibility of leaders.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Child has a way of writing that pulls you into the action and the character of Reacher, and holds you until the end.  Reacher, as a person, is very admirable to me.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app works as promised. My kindle fire hd was running slow till I put this on and cleaned out all the dead files and ran the memory cleaner.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The character of Reacher is very compelling to me.  These books hold me from start to finish.  For me, it's pure escapism.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|the book was a little hard to read, but the dvd was awesome. After I watched the dvd went back and reread the book. Then read the two to follow. Was sad to see them end. All excellent books.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Liked the characters, stories and timeline.  Great CGI.  To bad it took so long for the series to find its audience.
B001AITH50|5.0|Best Vamp movie ever and amazing actors/actresses. I just had to buy it because it is awesome. Great movie !
B00679T1EO|5.0|I should and would have been watching from the very start since I love this sort of series/movies.  There is a real joy watching episode after episode to catch up. I even did the ironing while I was glued to the TV!!  Love this Series!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Was expecting to be able to do more with the product, but it did not live to my expectation. Rather disappointing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works extremely wee and priced right. I have used it to watch Netflix on a high def tv. Get one.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is soooooooooooo AWESOME. I can't believe that people don't like this app. I love this app soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!
B00C5R8364|3.0|Forsythe seems to be coasting here, phoning it in. A plodding presentation of systems and hardware.<br />He should give it up while he is still respected.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a good game it is better than subway s. The game is about a minion that wants to be minion of the year and so you go on a cool adventure in labs in city's and at a beach that was the new update.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was very fantasy-like, dark, like the other Neil Gaiman book I read.  It is told through the eyes of a man telling of an experience from his childhood.  It isn't the kind of book I usually read, but I enjoyed &#34;American Gods&#34; so much I gave it a try.  While I didn't like it quite as much as &#34;American Gods,&#34; I was really sucked into the story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game, and its FREE!!<br />I recommend this to any angry birds fans.<br />It's as usual always fun and angry!!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It was a good season, I really was not happy with all the death surrounding child birth, but we shall see what next season brings.
B008ROH07W|5.0|I had never heard such a perfect rendition of trumpet concertos played with a baroque trumpet. Unbelievable. You have to listen to it yourself to fully appreciate the perfect mastery of this instrument by Alison Balsom. A rare musical treat!
B00181JGI2|1.0|I could not believe what I was hearing, 3excellent actors , I expected to see a good movie. Instead all I heard was F word, probably 10 times a minute.  Do not let your children see this.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|Movie constantly started and stopped, black screen with gold circle  interruptions. Even restarted film and refreshed multiple times and issue still displayed in same areas. Have not had this issue with other films. Would like to get a refund as I paid to enjoy a movie and clearly could not. Had the potential to be a good chick flick, but too many parts were either screwed up or missed because of the tech issues. :(
B008MG1E4A|5.0|These SEALS are all heros. God bless them for their service. Book was well written. Job well done. Thank you
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you bought the special edition Madden with NFL sunday ticket promo, this is an awesome way to stream the games to your TV.
1476727910|4.0|This is an interesting look at another life form finding out what it is like to be human.  At times I thought of John Carpenter's movie Starman and at other moments I was thinking about Star Trek, The Next Generation's &#34;resistance is futile&#34; and the Borg.<br /><br />At the beginning we discover a man who has just died and is taken over by.....well, he doesn't have a name.  So this alien becomes  Dr. Andrew Martin, a mathematician at Cambridge University who just discovered what may change life on Earth.  And along the way 'Andrew' learns that nothing is easy.  The life he leads comes with some serious baggage.<br /><br />His marriage is crumbling and his son loathes him.  He has a few acquaintances but no friends.  He has slowly given away all his decency to achieve the answer to his mysterious equations.  And what for?<br /><br />I chose this book because it had a great write-up in our local newspaper.  The writing is jerky at times but it still entertaining.  'Andrew' is both annoying and charming because of his innocence.  And that is part of the problem.  It kept occurring to me that if this species was so intelligent why would things have happened the way they did?  But this is fiction and I came away from the story appreciating myself more and determined to become a better neighbor.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|As the story continues....the acting is a little over the top. But then again, the over exaggerated acting goes hand in hand with the story line. If you like the Star Trek saga, you'll enjoy this movie.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read the whole book in less than 2 weeks. I really enjoyed the book and am currently trying to get my &#34;boyfriend&#34; to read the book with me. I think it is a great relationship tool in which you will have a lot of ahh haa moments. It really opened my eyes to the way that others perceive love and how I can demonstrate it in a more positive manner.
B001HN694K|3.0|It was different, not the usual type of movie I would watch.  I guess it was the packaging that made me buy it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Again I downloaded this app because I love to play Candy Crush Saga. I can't download the game on my Kindlefire at all. This app does not help if you are stuck on a level like I thought it would. I wish I cam remove both apps about Candy Crush Saga from my Kindlefire even though they were free.
B0026145WK|5.0|Liam Neeson is at his best --- he is divorced and his daughter is kidnapped when she goes to Paris with a friend.  She is taken to be sold in the illegal sex trade.  Neeson goes to Paris and starts tracking down his daughter where he finds rich/important people involved in the sex trade.  This is a non-stop high quality action film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed and cried so many times. Finished this book in pretty much 24 hours, couldn't put it down. Beautifully written.<br />I love it!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|This movie was poorly acted, poorly written, poorly executed, and poorly directed. I can't believe how badly they fumbled such a great cast and an concept that could have been pretty cool.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Excellent!!!!Love the story, you can't put the book down. Love Reacher it's a shame he moves away so fast. Buy it!!!!
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|Enjoy both actors....that is why we bought it.  Different..wasn't really hep on the accent that Travolta used, but DeNiro was his usually great self.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|I haven't seen anything quite like this, so can't compare it to other films. The special effects, ghosts etc., were very well done, and anything with Maggie Smith in it is a must,  she is always good. All the children were excellent. Good story line, 1940s era, sad in parts.<br />Well worth watching
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|The boys in the movie were really good...that kept my interest and made it believable.  For times and area...interesting for those who never lived that way.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game. Its really fun.I like it because she thinks its fun and that keeps her busy.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Top drama never stops. Great to see in succession as story and plot develops. Can't wait for season five civil war.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|great fun continuing in the angry birds games.  I love it for the Star Wars themes.  Highly recommended if you love angry birds.
B00BT8Y774|5.0|There was no scratches and came before it was due. Overall though it is a great movie and I highly recommend it for anyone young and old!
B000FGFBEE|3.0|Just watched this movie tonight on DVD after many years since my last viewing (when I never paid much attention anyhow while it was on TV).  I read the book a few months ago and rated it 4.5 stars.  The book was much better.  Perhaps if there was no book, the movie would rate higher having nothing to compare it too.  I'm not sure why this movie is considered one of the best films ever made.  Maybe it's a classic by Hollywood standards for its place and time and some of the actors involved, but it's lightweight when compared to the book (perhaps an inevitability).  Is it worth a watch?  Certainly.  But please, read the book, too.  It's better... much better.  As for the movie, if you can get past the fact that the location scenery (despite its beauty) is all wrong and that the lead Indian is played by a white guy, then it gets four stars.  The extras on the second DVD are very good.  For overall entertainment value I rate the entire package four stars.  But the movie itself gets three stars.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I never thought a television show could compete with The Andy Griffith Show (\\"Andy\\") for best television ever, but I was wrong.  I believe that the acting, storyline, writing, directing and production on Breaking Bad are at least as good in every category as any other show ever shown on television.  Combined, it's the best show ever.  Anyone who likes to think while they are watching television should have this on their bucket list.  Like Andy, which is an awesome show competing in a different genre, Breaking Bad is one for the ages.  Breaking Bad, however, trumps Andy overall even after considering technical limits in Andy's era.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Amazing. I started watching this thinking of the first movie. Not anywhere close. This movie rocks. Non stop action. Non stop killing. Non stop get the bad guys. Just plain old non stop kick ass movie. Totally amazing.<br />Again: OUTSTANDING .
B007MDB71O|4.0|Wish they would make a John carter 2 it was that good I didn't even see that ending coming. But hopefully there is a second because it just kind of left off like what's going to happen next. The first one was good its got action and a bit of comedy. Good for adults and kids.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|One of the best of the jewel games. Very user friendly and it just keeps going. Watch the timer jewels as they shorten the time you have to get it done.
B000067QMD|4.0|It's helpful being able to have &#34;lids&#34; for the bottles other than nipples for when you either need to shake formula or store breastmilk in the fridge.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love to watch this kind of show, it's wonderful to see programs from this era, the characters are excellent, you feel just like you are at Downton Abbey!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. there is so many awsome possibilities with this epic game. I love that updates are coming out  quickly.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|Great book in a great Series! I highly recommend both this book and the rest of the Eragon books! It's fantastic!
B009NX61JY|4.0|I thought I might not like this movie when I began watching it.<br />It took some time to build but, I should have known, anything Barbara Streisand does, she does better than well.<br />It was more than worth the wait.<br /><br />Be patient, enjoy the build, it makes it fun to watch and you will recommend it to friends.
B003G4W49C|3.0|A very interesting story with obtuse angles.  Somewhat painful to read when investing in the protagonist.  However, when the underpinning comes undone, we have our own mirror to look into.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This one borders on tedious. Stretched out longer than necessary, though still plenty of John Corey to go around. He and Kate's relationship isn't very good, and seems perfunctory. This is either foreshadowing or bad writing - I'm not sure which, but I'm leaning toward the latter. Anyway, this book is not DeMille's best moment.
B008AX1HD8|1.0|I'm a great fan of Jo Nesbo, but there's a very good reason it took so long to translate this first novel into English...it's a shocker. The plot, characters and dialogue are a mishmash of poorly researched, clich&eacute;-ridden stereotypes. The attempted retelling of Aboriginal Dreamtime stories is patronizing, ill-informed and tedious. In fact I would go so far as to say that many indigenous Australians will find it offensive. This book should have been sentenced to life without parole in Norwegian. Thankfully Nesbo eventually learned how to write.
B00DVXVMT6|5.0|For the new lineup.  Chimaira albums have been mediocre at best since Impossibility in 2003.  The self titled album Chimaira in 2005 was the beginning of the downhill slippery slope with about half the album worthy of replay.  Sure the albums after occasionally squeezed in a good track or two but nothing on par with Impossibility.<br /><br />Crown of Phantoms has revitalized the bands name with something special, an album that can be replayed and enjoyed over and over as a whole.  There is no more skipping tracks on this album.<br /><br />I've read where the new guitar line up is sub-par compared to Arnold and DeVries and I say don't listen to that drivel.  These aren't the most complex riffs or the best guitarist duo, but they are so good at what they do with the new sound they bring to Chimaira.  It's so refreshing and worth every penny.<br /><br />I sampled the album from tube and found myself replaying track after track and decided this album is worth the purchase and it just gets better with each replay.<br /><br />This is one of those albums where maybe one or two tracks really stand out but the others keep this album in your player for a long time, hopefully until the next album of the same caliber.  There are some really nice riffs throughout each track and you'll find yourself listening to each track over and over.<br /><br />If I have to sell this album i'll start with Plastic Wonderland.  If this song doesn't sell you then nothing will.  As I mentioned the album is a strong effort and laced with rewarding riffs and those moments where you want to turn it up louder.  Love Soaked Death, I Despise, Spineless, Kings of the Shadow World are probably my favorites in order.<br /><br />I am guessing Arnold and DeVries are probably at home cranking this album up wondering why they weren't able to come up with music like this in the past 10 years.<br /><br />Other bands I enjoy: Devildriver, Parkway Drive, Shadows Fall, Threat Signal (old), Throwdown, Unearth, FearFactory, Mnemic (old), Heart in Hand, Skinlab, Sybreed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I chose this for my book club and was a bit nervous about the selection. If Sherman Alexie wrote a book like Ender's Game, then this is the adult version of that book. The author did a great job mixing the eighties pop and videogame culture with a postapocalyptic view of where the world is headed. Great, funny, entertaining and suspenseful!
B0036TGT2A|1.0|Disney diamond edition blu ray very disappointing.<br />We have been waiting a long time for this. This is one of the best Disney films but this has not had very much work done before the transfer there is a lot of noise on the blu ray.<br />My advice at the moment just pay for the DVD and enjoy it just as much
B00F35BV64|2.0|One star for Benedict Cumberbatch's villain, another for Simon Peg's Scotty, and no stars whatsoever for anyone else involved in the making of this film. To start with the film suffers the usual emphasis on graphic effects madness over actual story-telling, a defining characteristic and artistic cop out of big budget Hollywood productions. Such films are designed exclusively it seems to guarantee a hefty return on investment by catering to a dumb, dumber, and dumbed down audiences with one carrot and one brussels sprout at most for those who expect something more than 150 minutes of fist fights and explosions in a motion picture. I feel JJ Abrams has made another highly profitable Yugo of a movie with a shiny paint job and no new substance for audiences to ponder. Into Darkness is the product of a lowered bar and a near thorough artistic bust. If Gene Roddenberry is foaming at the mouth on the other side, he has my full sympathies.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|With the lens flare, the 3D is almost impossible to watch.  After making the family sick, we switched over tot he regular Blu Ray and enjoyed it very much.  Another great movie in the new series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandchildren loved the game, kept them busy for hours. I would recommend this to any child, I would put it up there with Mind Craft.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I spent most of the movie looking for Waldo but never found him.<br /><br />Other then that fact, I thought the movie was very entertaining and kept me interested the entire time.  Would recommend it if you are looking for a good rental as the replay value after seeing it is not there.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|I'd give this ZERO stars if I could.  Not because the movie was bad - it wasn't.  The streaming from Amazon was awful!  The movie kept pausing and we got to watch a little arrow going around in a circle - A LOT!!!  Of course. there's no way to address this on-line [as far as i  can determine].  So now what?  Is it worth $3.99 to refuse payment through the credit card company?  Probably not.  I'm growing fonder and fonder of Red Box.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Kerman does a good job of depicting her life in prison, and it is an interesting read. However, beware that although the book does have some similarities to the show, it is not the show on Netflix.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|The first time I watched a Torchwood show I was hooked.  I love the characters and the wacky stories for the series. You don't have to be a Dr. Who fan to like this.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|I had just started using Google's reader when i read an article (irony intended) that the reader was being phased out. With it came a recommendation for feedly (along with others). I was able to easily synch the 2 and then began using feedly exclusively. Easy to add feeds and categories. I can choose from various display options and they look lovely.<br />Using kindle fire 2nd generation.
B0010X8NF0|3.0|Kind of a fun movie - didn't follow the story too carefully -- great camera work & scenes and excellent acting. I couldn't rate it more than 3 start sorry.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Great story, detective story with action and surprise ending. No nudity and very little swearing very suspenseful.The wife and I enjoyed the acting and pace of the plot.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the plot,people do not change! If Humans have to start over again, we still be doing the same stuff we have always done!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|100% fun n time pass for all the age groups I guess. My kid loves playing this and plays again n again.
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|This figurine is awesome. Looks just like the character. My only complaint is he can't hold the bag or he tips over but that's minor.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I have bought MARWARE for each of my kiindles and really like them.<br />I wasn't too sure about the bright orange, but find that I do like it.<br />These cases are excellent quality. They withstand a lot of wear and tear, My kindle goes everywhere with me, and the case still looks like new.<br />The fact that you can turn and prop the screen any way you want it........Perfect!  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Only one recommendation - in my opinion not serious. There should be some sort of clasp or hook so the screen doesn't fall down when you want to read in bed. The elastic doesn't hold the actual screen.  Or, at least I haven't found a way to do it!!
0307595579|5.0|This is a splendid boxed set.<br /><br />First of all, the cloth and pigment stamps makes the books very gorgeous. I thought that I would have to take special care of the books to prevent staining but they don't have a single imperfection in the couple years I've had this set.<br /><br />Secondly, the map inside is very helpful. The first time I read the books over 3 years ago, it was kind of hard for me to imagine a few of the locations,particularly Hedeby Island and this map has been very helpful.<br /><br />And last but especially not the least, the book \\"On Stieg Larsson\\". There wasn't much I knew about Larsson at the time I first read the books. I was intrigued about this book in the set and I liked all of what his coworkers had to say but I liked nothing more than the email correspondence with his editor Eva, which gives a lot of insight into what he thought about the publishing process.<br /><br />Ideal for any big Millennium Trilogy fan.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once again a great story with a few little twists. Connelly never let's me down and I can't wait for his next book!
0762761296|4.0|This is truly a story of endurance, like so many situations in war situations..needs to be shared, but it will only reach a few people..

0812993845|1.0|Was hoping for some light funny poignant banter that I have come to love from the author's previous books 20's girl and remember me ? I got none of these things from whatever this was suppose to be. It was one of the worst things I have ever read. The saddest part of all was I rented it for FREE at the library.I feel completely ashamed for the wasted time on this crapfest.About halfway through I just started rolling my eyes and muttering this is so bleeping stupid.<br /><br />It is such a cheesy ripoff of several stellar novels such as sense and sensibility. Almost all of the characters stink. Even the kid who I am supposed to find adorable drove me nuts with his compulsive lying. I mean he is supposed to be a gifted 7 year old and he acts like a certian 3 year old that lives at my house.<br /><br />The older sister is an absolute nightmare.I am suppose to be ok with her actions or at least care about her but she is so bitter delusional and scary that I really couldn't. And the nice guys seemed like pathetic jerks who threw tantrums all the time.I actually was cheering for the two drunk lovebirds to get it on. They were dumb and impulsive but kind of reminded me of this couple I know who did some of the same things and are still happily married and much wiser after 40 years.<br /><br />The only good part of the book was dirk and sally, the fake tv detectives who reminded me of max and agent 99 from get smart. They were a welcome respite from this drag of a book.Maybe next time sophia kinsella should write about them.At least the were fun and engaging.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Very exciting.  too much eyebrows to contend with, however.  I don't understand why I need to do this.  Do I get a free movie?
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Great album. If you buy it because you like red hands, you will enjoy the rest as well. My kids even love it. This album is really fun. I highly recommend it.
B00756GRUE|5.0|The watch arrived in excellent condition. The band was not difficult to adjust, attentive to small inner sleeve that presents each adjustment pin. Its easy to synchronize system time, in fact there was no need to consult the manual as it is more or less the standard of all watches of this type with screw down crown.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|The author describes the daily lives of North Koreans. It is very well written and I did not want to stop reading it, although the stories are so shockingly awful and sad. It portraits very well under which circumstances the people have to suffer and it makes me wonder, how this can still be happening.

B001F6ZIXC|1.0|I thought the premise of the series was  ridiculous.  These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers.  The script throws in glimpses of male bonding, emotional depth, and odd paradoxical integrity, which comes off as absurd given that they're just a bunch of middle aged wannabes caught up in an arrested development of their teens.  If the storyline didn't attempt to be taken seriously, it could have been a good comic satire.

B002QW7AJY|5.0|Pandorum starts off by introducing us to the two lead characters, Bower and Payton, two members of the flight crew aboard the space craft Elysium, which was supposed to be heading to the planet Tanis. Earth had become polluted and overpopulated by 2074, and so humanity needed to expand. When the planet Tanis is discovered by a rover sent by NASA, Elysium is launched. Now, present day, our two leads wake up after extended hyper-sleep to find the ship empty, and functioning at the lowest capacity. So, the two decide to get to the bottom of this mystery, only to discover that they're not alone on the ship, and if they can't find a way to the ship's bridge, they'll be dead before they can even call for help.<br /><br />Directed and co-written by Christian Alvert, Pandorum is advertised as a sci-fi horror film, but really it works more like a grotesque, sci-fi/psychological thriller. Alvert's directing here is very rich and intense, helping shape the eerie and foreboding atmosphere that is the ship Elysium. The dark corridors and bleak light scheme all help to bring about that sense of dread and fear, with loneliness playing a key role as well. The visual effects, while in a couple places are just decent (the Reactor turning back on), was overall incredibly impressive and award-worthy, especially the very first shot of Elysium not three minutes into the movie. The acting was superb, especially from Ben Foster and Antje Traue. Foster plays Bower, and Traue is another individual aboard Elysium who offers assistance is saving the ship. Dennis Quaid was great as Payton, but when Cam Gigandet shows up, things go insane. He's an alright actor with some very poor roles (Never Back Down, The Unborn, Twilight), but he shows his acting chops in A-Grade form here, playing the mentally scarred Corporal Gallo, who mysteriously managed to get off the ship's bridge when it was locked down. The musical score was very impressive, sounding like a mix of Han Zimmer's The Ring and Joseph Bishara's Dark Skies. The script was very good, too, but the amount of gory violence may be off-putting for some movie-goers. While I don't mind gore in a movie (unless it's excessive, like the Saw sequels), they could have had less gore in Pandorum and it would have been great still. But it also did help because, when you see it in context with what's happening, the animalistic nature of it is frightening and effective.<br /><br />Pandorum is a truly mesmerizing experience that takes us into the unknown (literally), and what we find is something so unimaginable, it will haunt us forever. We don't know what the effects of deep-space travel will have on us, or what is really out there in the dark void. All we know, is that one day, we will have to make a choice that will affect all of humanity for better or worse. Also, there is surprisingly room for a sequel, so hopefully someone from the crew of Pandorum steps up and uses Kickstarter to green-light it since it's worked for Spike Lee and the Veronica Mars movie.<br /><br />I find these words from Carl Sagan, to be very true and very relevant. \\"The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars.\\"<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars

B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This is an extremely imaginative and fun game. Unfortunately, on my Samsung Galaxy III, some of the essential controls are unavailable (eg, erase, stop, and resume sugar flow). Not having these controls available makes the game much more difficult yet still very enjoyable to play. I noticed all controls are available in the sandbox, so uncertain whether you need to get to a certain level before these controls become available. Once my potential confusion is resolved or these additional controls become available, I'll change my rating to 5 stars.

B004NDJXOO|3.0|This is a great Michael J. Fox film with some cool effects, '80s music and story. I still watch Secret of my Success, Back to the Future and Teen Wolf regularly for laughs. Those fun, light comedies were the specialty of Fox. The Blu-ray picture quality isn't up to snuff and the audio is only marginally better (DTS-HD MA monaural track). Bonus content in this Blu-ray is disappointingly light. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star package. The DVD included Teen Wolf Too with Jason Bateman but it is nowhere near as good as the original so you aren't missing much (it isn't included in the Blu-ray).

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is even better than the first. It is full of adventure and challenging situations on a daily basis. We get to learn more about Christian and Anastasia on a deeper level. All of the characters develop more as the story continues and the events in book two make it impossible for the reader to stop at book two. Readers cannot resist continuing on to read book three aka &#34;Fifty Shades Freed&#34;!
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The Passion of the Christ gets the royal treatment in this 2-disc, region-free Blu-ray release (1 BD & 1 DVD). This release is sure to satisfy Christians or just people who appreciate an amazing true story. There are two cuts provided (the original and the 122-minute Passion Recut). The picture uses a 1080p, 2.35:1-framed transfer that looks great. The audio is also terrific in DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless surround sound. Disc 2 contains: By His Wounds We Are Healed: Making the Passion of the Christ, The Legacy, Deleted Scenes and Photo Galleries. All the features from the previous 2-disc release are included. There is a total of roughly 3 hours of bonus content. By His Wounds, We Are Healed: Making 'The Passion of the Christ' (480p, 1:40:22) is a 21-part documentary that takes an in-depth look at numerous aspects of the filmmaking process, including the script, language, casting, costuming, direction, effects, editing, the score, marketing, and a look at the making of numerous critical scenes, including the Crucifixion. Next, The Legacy adds roughly one hour of bonus content.<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray. It is the \\"definitive edition\\" of the film to date and the price is right. My only complaint is that the bonus materials are in standard definition.
0553593544|5.0|First, let me say that I haven't seen any of the recent onslaught of Jason Bourne movies.  Apparently if you love the books, you hate the movies.  If you love the movies, you hate the books.  If you've never been exposed to either, you wonder just what all of the fuss is about.  The first of (what I think is) a three volume series was actually written almost forty years ago (around 1975), and I almost have to wonder why it took so long to make the adaptation to screen in the first place based on the apparent popularity of the series .<br /><br />Our story opens up somewhere in Europe (I forget specifically where).  Some local fishermen discover a body floating out in the ocean and they haul in this near-corpse that is miraculously still alive.  In the nearby small port town, there's only one doctor, who apparently moonlights as an alcoholic.  The doctor slowly nurses back this mysterious shodden figure back to health, and the specimen is definitely a unique find.  The doctor discovers that this man has had many parts of his body surgically altered to radically change his physical appearance.  Definitely something sinister here.  It doesn't help when the patient slowly regains consciousness over a period of weeks only to be suffering from amnesia.  He has no idea who he is nor where he came from.  The doctor finds a microchip embedded on the man's body, which only contains some random information about a bank account in Switzerland.  So this is basically all the patient has to go on if he wants to discover his identity.<br /><br />So this is where the ride really starts.  Without going into too much detail, let's just say that the man (he later finds out his name is Jason Bourne) is part of a clandestine government operation, and although he's supposed to know who he is, no one else is.  So when he starts arbitrarily showing up in places, such as the above mentioned  Switzerland bank, casually announcing who he is in attempt to find out who he really is, chaos, panic and a lot of shooting commences.  A lot of shooting.  Over a lot of pages.<br /><br />All of this is only the beginning, and we're taken on an incredibly complex labyrinth of details from this point of the book forward.  It's very easy to get lost with all of the mysterious figures coming and going, and this is a book that must be read (at least by me) slowly and carefully.  There's simply too much to digest.  For someone like myself who only speaks one language, it doesn't help that 95% of this novel takes place in a different country other than the United States.  The author describes a lot of detail in these strange countries, along with elaborate, but appropriate names and descriptions.  I simply found myself getting lost with all of the foreign names and locations.  Example:  If this story took place in the good old U.S. of A., with American characters, it might describe a scenario in this manner:<br /><br />\\"When I walked out of the Hilton, I saw a man that looked like Charlie, who was riding in a taxi when they drove past the Olive Garden on the way to the Main Street parade.\\"<br /><br />Since, however, we're in places like Switzerland and Germany, what we get instead is:<br /><br />\\"When I walked out of the Les Feltehtraum Sherrabere Deuz Kaptin, I saw a man that looked like Monsieur Von Klappentooff Schertzanhous who was riding in an AutoFrankenheis when they drove past the Gotte Zer Plettz Der Frouihenheppenhurffer on the way to the Des Mont De Shlavovitz on Perre\\".<br /><br />I realize that what I wrote is extreme jibberish, but this is exactly what it felt like to me after reading a couple of hundred pages or so of this book with all of its pristine details.  It made me wish that I kept a notebook on the side so I could take some copious notes that I could use for future reference.  There were several times when I just couldn't juggle and remember all of these complex foreign names and places.<br /><br />Another key fault of this book is the female \\"sidekick\\", or \\"accomplice\\".  Apparently, Robert Ludlum decided that if this story was going to have some teeth, he simply needed to give Jason Bourne an ally to help him through this complex nightmare.  That, in itself, is o.k. and probably even desirable.  It also doesn't hurt that she's young, has auburn hair, beautiful, etc.  What the problem is, is how she's thrown into the story.  Near the beginning of this adventure, Jason kidnaps her.  Not out of cruelty, but necessity.  Remember, he doesn't even know who he is.  Of course, after the initial kidnapping, she's rightfully terrified out of her wits, and seems to scream \\"Please let me go!\\" at least a bazillion times during a dozen or so pages.  Well, without drudging up the plot, let's just say that these two somehow, amazingly, become not only allies, but lovers.  It seems a bit preposterous for her to address him throughout the remainder of the pages as \\"my darling...\\" after what this man put her through.  She's overall a good character (as I write this, I can't remember her name.  Not really important),I just wish a bit more care would have been taken into how she becomes involved.<br /><br />So the story continues, and each page is packed with action.  Although I couldn't give you a very thorough explanation of who everyone in this book was, and what purpose they served, the story was overall enjoyable even though my head was spinning much of the time due to the complex plot.  The book manages to have a very satisfying conclusion, yet leaves room for more story, which I'm assuming will be picked up with the next books in the series.  I look forward to reading the next couple of volumes.  Some day.ekick\\", or \\"accomplice\\".

The stories are good, but joke after joke after joke got very tiring.  He had his moments a few times, but for the most part they fell short of funny, and distracted from the theme of the book.

0143124544|4.0|This was a surprisingly touching story about the relationship that develops between a caregiver and her patient. When she finds herself newly unemployed, Louisa Clark tries to find a new job as quickly as she can because she knows her parents, sister and nephew rely on her income to keep the family solvent. After a series of unsuccessful stints at various employment situations, Lou interviews for and accepts a position that offers her a 6 month contract as a paid companion of sorts to a young man, Will Traynor, who was left a quadriplegic after being hit by a motorcycle.<br /><br />At first, Lou wonders why the limited contract, and she finds her employer, Will's parents, and her patient difficult and very complicated. When she learns the real reason she was given the job, Lou begins a campaign that involves trying to get Will to see some hope for his life and to show him that he is not confined to the annex apartment where he now lives in pain and isolation. It soon becomes clear that it may be that it will be Lou who ends up the most changed.<br /><br />I don't know if the author intended this, but the man's name -- Will -- summarizes the scope of the big question in the novel -- can Will develop a &#34;will&#34; to live with this devastating handicap? Formerly the owner of a hugely successful business and a very active daredevil lifestyle, he is despondent as he accepts that he has lost everything that made him HIM. As Lou tries to draw him out of his prison, engage him in activities and travel, Will seems to become happier and everyone is hopeful that he's turned a corner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Will has already made a decision that no one believes is firm. He has no control over any aspect of his daily life and medical situation, but there is still one thing he can do to take back his autonomy. Can Lou change his mind? There is nothing that she won't try.<br /><br />This was a book that begged to be read in one sitting and I was totally absorbed even as I anxiously dreaded the possibilities for an ending. The controversial nature of the central theme is handled objectively without being moralistic. I really enjoyed it and feel this would be an excellent choice for a book group. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in &#34;right to die&#34; issues.<br /><br />Thank you to NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP for the ebook to review.xiously dreaded the possibilities for an ending.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Before starting to watch this series with my wife I always thought I it wouldn't interest me at all but I was completely wrong. I thought the show was simple about a rich aristocratic family but it's so much more, and has far more depth then I could have imagined.<br /><br />Through the family, the servants surrounding areas you see the changes that take place, not just to the family but also those working for them and even society as a whole. In addition seeing people adapt to technologic changes during that time period, ranging from electricity, phones and even cars, is very enlightening and interesting.

B00BOXZAG6|3.0|A wonderful idea with momentum that just drops off the radar. So many opportunities to pick up on plot development are lost, and revert to kissing scenes to make up for a complete absence of cohesion, dialog, and how the main characters could possibly be this in love (based strictly on the content). The 3D was 'just okay', nothing more.  Less than expected.

B00ARF92HK|4.0|Surprisingly good!  If you're a fan of the comic or not you can enjoy this movie.  I think the slow motion scenes were a very nice touch.  They weren't over done and take away from the movie like some trip scenes I've seen in the past.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Awesome! Bradley Cooper is great. Acting is superb and the story line is intriguing. Very good. Not a typical romantic comedy.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Each actor's part is greater than the sum of this movie as a whole.<br /><br />There are a lot of A-list actors in this movie that have sold their name (not talent) to make a pointless movie.<br /><br />The movie starts off in a very hyped up fashion, and instead of a truly awesome story-line...there is nothing...but worse, the audience comes away feeling duped. The screenwriters definitely cornered themselves in when writing this, and made $75 Million disappear--that's the cost of making it.

B003Z6QGGS|5.0|I have been listening to the great music of Megadeth since High School and it was brilliant to read the full story of Dave and how his music came about. A very honest and compelling insight into himself and the band. Couldn't put it down and will certainly read it again.
B00DW3X07M|5.0|Pretty fantastic stuff.  As a musician, I can relate to the difficulty of what is being played, but the melodies you can hold onto even through the complex changes. Very fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Depending on the obstacles that come in your player's way, you need to move side to side, up, or down trying not to hit those obstacles and also trying to run away from the police after finding you spraying gratify on a train! Super fun game!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Above is an awesome way to take look back at Layne Staley during some happy times.  The music and his voice are both beautiful.  If you're a Staley fan this is a must have.  RIP Layne
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I wouldn't recommend this for little kids because it does take a lot of thinking and it nah be a little hard for them. As sugar slowly falls down you need to somehow move the sugar into the right cup and then you move on to the next level which gets harder and harder. To me it's not really addicting but for you it might get !
B005FITIIC|5.0|I love this movie. It so timely for currant events in our financial market. Great acting by all of the cast. A best buy.
0394800184|1.0|It just makes me as an adult feel sad as I read it, so you can imagine how it would make a child feel! The little bird is lost, alone, and doesn't know if he'll ever find his mother. I agree with the other 1 star reviews; this should be a horror story, not a bedtime story. Whoever wrote it was totally numb to children's feelings, and totally out of it. We just threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money.
B00CFA227C|5.0|My 10 year old son and I, really enjoy this movie. Great story, good acting and great graphics. A best buy.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I ordered the replacements hoping it would fit well and enhance the sound performance. Easy to install but foam cover is worth the struggle to attach. Now great sound & comfort using my Bluetooth.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Exactly what I expected i  songs and quality performances. woukd have liked to have had &#34;What's that snell&#34;, too. A value perchase.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Right when I thought I was following what was going on, I was wrong. A great read and page turner. My friend had been telling me to read it for a while. I was texting her, &#34;what the h*ll?!&#34; around every corner. It is a must read!
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|This a really good series. Great acting by all of the cast. Hope with all my heart that there will be a second season.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Extremely well done and is addictive. Doesn't need special effects to make this great series. American entertainment industry should take note.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked how the characters were intertwined and all had something in common<br />Although I had trouble keeping the characters straight.  Eqw
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Good game liked graphics are wonderful I like playing these kind of games. Hope there are more like this one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I've just started, but so far it's fun.  It is not like the original Oregon Trail but I like it.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|The team at Pixar is becoming my fast favorite for children's movies.  Toy Story, Cars, and now the Monsters series are awesome!
B003QCCS36|5.0|I heard a guy play Devil's in the Jukebox on the ukulele and and really became taken with the song.  When I found out the song came from this album I had to get it. Great album by Lamontagne and the Pariah Dogs.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Imagine tons of characters. Twists and turns in the story on every page. All these twists+turns leading nowehere !! Then throw in a totally anti-climactic ending on the 500th page. All that J.KRowling has proved with her 2 latest books are:<br /><br />-She aint no Arthur Conan Doyle<br />-When you pick very very ordinary places/events as your core setting, its impossible to relate to it. Reading 500pp about a hole in a wall called Pagsford is total b.s<br /><br />On the flip side, she is totally inspirational though. If she can turn out books that changed the paperback industry, then I am definitely inspired to write books also.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|No spam, no ads, just a fun game. My daughter and I are just laughing out loud as we figure these out together. A perfect touch screen game. BRAVO!
B0010T0QOA|4.0|I love Crocs. I've lived in them for about ten years... exclusively. The snobs that feel they are somehow entitled to dis these magnificent inventions because they view them as &#34;grotesque&#34; or &#34;ugly&#34; footwear may simply take a large bite out of my well-endowed derriere. Crocs are the most comfortable and enduring shoes I have ever worn and I pray earnestly that they never become extinct - I'm just not sure what else I could wear and not have my feet in absolute agony. I do have to admit, however, that this particular pair has a curious characteristic. I'm not sure if it's my feet or the design of the shoe itself, but when I walk, each step creates a suction that makes a diarrhea farting sound. Since I spend most of my days with little children, the questionable auditory stimulus serves mainly to elicit laughter. I'm not quite sure, however, if I have the testicular development to wear them around adults. In the meantime, I've heard it said that nobody's gaseous expulsions smell to themselves. On the basis of that edifying concept, I will resign myself to enjoying my curiously unique farting shoes. I guess I can always blame it on the dog.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Great light summer read!! Intriguing even if it is predictable!! Characters draw you in immediately! I way to live there!!
B00A5IXYR8|2.0|I like David Lynch, dancing midgets & all. I didn't get the meaning of this depressing black & white movie, except that it was a depressing black & white movie. I gave it two stars as homage to other David Lynch work I enjoyed, including Mulholland Drive & Twin Peaks. Spend your money there. See if you could bear you way through it for free before you buy it.
B000JLSM00|4.0|I have lots of DVDs and this is one I play again once a year or so.  Wayne had his niche, and some say this was one of his best.<br /><br />Every now and then you may feel the urge to see it again, and that;s OK.  Too often and you're in Palookaville.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|When it comes to movies, I'm generally all about pace.  If it's got more bored and wondering when on earth this thing will end at any point in the movie then I'm not too happy.<br /><br />That's the problem I have with the first movie -- a lot of drama (actually, TOO much drama) early in the film and then it tones down into this depressing period and the pace is so darn slow at that point that I just can't wait for the end to be over.  Honestly, even though I know what happens its hard for me to even watch that movie because of that dragging period in the middle.<br /><br />Thank goodness that this movie doesn't have that.  There's no extreme ridiculous drama that involves breakups or extreme depression.  It's just a simply \\"hang out with your girlfriends kind of movie\\".  Plus, you get to go with them on a trip to the middle east AND you get to see Aidan!  And no, I didn't find Aidan coming in ridiculous... just a nice extra touch.  I also didn't find it culturally insensitive either (and this is coming from someone who has lived abroad).  It simply expresses the culture from an American female perspective... I wouldn't really expect much different.  It can (and does) happen the other way around too. I don't see any egocentricity in it, honestly.<br /><br />What I honestly really did like was Charlotte and Miranda having their problems with the life of being a mother (Miranda struggling to balance it with work and Charlotte simply handling the stress of her youngest crying constantly).  I felt it just really expressed the reality of it and then showed the need to take some time out and spend it with your girlfriends when everything's going crazy.<br /><br />That being said, I also liked Carrie and Big's discussion about possibly taking two days off a week to go do their own thing without each other.  It's new, it's different, it's very non-conventional, yet it's also a very very real possibility in current and future marriages to keep things working and to have that\\"sparkle\\".<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this movie because it had a good even pace throughout and because the topics that came up were real... and can encourage one to contemplate on they want their marriage to really be.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|The game is a lot of fun but I only started so I don't know if there are any bugs yet(review from 14 yr old son)
B00785P2QC|3.0|It is a good game<br />Please dawnload  I build my city what about u<br />It is not bad , I have a little problem the expanding of my city because there always a hill in the new area
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|A lot of fun but a little tricky to control in touch mode late in the game but still awesome for being a cheap game(review from 14 yr old son)
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story line I can follow but not the spelling of the names as they are confusing for me.  I really enjoyed his first book.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a better app then the weather channel app I have on my phone. Easy to read. Nice radar screen, colors and all.
B000002GGU|5.0|Songs from the past often bring up memories and a song from this album brought this CD to my attention and it has many good songs.  Nostalgia!!
B005EVVESM|5.0|Really enjoy this entire CD!  Every song is good, and most are really good / great!  I'd definitely recommend this.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is the second novel of Neil Gaiman that I have read, American Gods being the first. I was not disappointed. If you enjoy alternate realities, rips in time or voids between world's, this is the book for you. Fast paced, action packed and thought-provoking. Loved it.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|Well written and indicative of extensive knowledge, probably arising from deep research, of the various areas covered in the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app has everything you need to have fun. It keeps you on your toes so u get a great challenge time After time .My kids live this app .<br />I would recommend this app to everyone  thanks for making this a great game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hands and eyes got to work together you don't u don't know if u can. Get between the trains.When I got in moscow the game got better.Its more fun.
B0029O08WA|5.0|My children requested this be ordered for their listening pleasure.<br />It arrived in a timely manner, well padded, securely wrapped, and in brand new sealed condition.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I'm a dog owner, but I happened to find this book by accident. To me it just shows the power that the love a pet, or you could called family
B00F35BV64|3.0|While I enjoyed the movie, I found that the characters of Kirk and Spock are really far from the original Star Trek. Kirk is wild and reckless while in the original series and films he was the best leader and the perfect commander, Pine is not a good fit at all. I also liked Spock in the first reboot but I found the romance aspect which is over played in this film kind of silly.<br />I cannot imagine Ohura and Spock having ever hooked up and the romance storyline takes away from the film.<br />Khan was brilliant! over all not a good follow-up, but entertaining.<br />The rest of the characters are left, doing not much but impressions of the originals.<br />If this reboot wants to really follow the original, these guys need more time at the academy and less fooling around.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It was great  A story about A company GI's during WW 2 In the paratroopers.From their training in georgia also personel troubles it tells what they went threw as A team the hard ships in battle and after also the problems they had when A new commanding officer turns up.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|The shows are pretty good but there are a lot of time gaps between episodes and the characters are not as likeable as &#34;Cousin Matthew&#34; or &#34;Lady Marry.&#34;  I enjoyed every show but I would not put it on my top priority list.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  When hooked up to a quality set of headphones, I'd swear it sounds like a full Marshall Stack.  The quiet solution to practicing at any hour of the day.  A must for every possibles bag.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|This movie was fun and unique as well as creative in light if the zombie craze. Don't expect to be wowed by effects or convinced in anyway this would be possible, but it's cute and has some hilarious moments and one liners.
140006922X|4.0|As a Jew, I found the book about a time that I have not understood, not researched and not learned much about, a fascinating read. The author appears to have given much thought and research into this period. However, his use of the wording Jewish Cult or Temple Cult to describe a religion that at the time was 3,000 years old is perjorative and demeaning.  The Jewish religion had already a very established book of rules and morality, the Torah. it had a history, the ten commandments, holidays and culture.  Judiasm  was more then a religion, it described a people and was certainly not a &#34; cult&#34; at the time.  All religions evolve over time and usually for the better , but it was a sticking point for me and offensive. otherwise I liked the book very much.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I play my kindle in school slot and this game really kept me awake it's exciting challenging and creative I mean come on building rockets and then flying them into space it's awesome. Personally my favorite thing about the game is that it has a pretty realistic physics engine and my favorite challenge is the thrust challenge I highly recommend getting this app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun! The graphics are great ! I  could play this all day everyday! It's fun for the whole family!
0345803485|1.0|Don't believe the hype. This book is way overrated and horribly written. I did not even make it through the whole story before throwing it away.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|My kids loved it. Good choice. I would watch it again. There was lots of action and adventure. Try it you will like it.
0345803485|3.0|E.L. James has written an unanticipated story of innocence and debauchery. Since I am not inclined to read fiction, this book opened a new world to me.  It is the erotic and passionate account of a man and a woman who, bieng very different manage to fascinate one another embarking on a forbidding and clandestine affair.<br />The saga of Anastasia and Christian reminds me  of tales of the Marquee de Sade since it deals with Dominance, Submission and Sado masochism.  The characters are likeable and charasmatic and keep you reading as they become attached to one another in their rather hypnotic and rapturous relationship.  The unexpected ending is abrupt but opens the way for a sequel as there are other books written to continue the story, i.e. the Trilogy.  I must make up my mind if I want to read the other books. The story does whet your appetite and curiosity.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Love Daft Punk! Mitsumoto's illustrations and story is incredible! Together a perfect combination of something visually appealing teaming up with something pleasing to listen to!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I like the script and the character portrayal. However, the plot outcome is often too obvious.<br />The accident in the last episode was a bit contrived and unnecessary, although not unexpected considering the heavy-handed foreshadowing. As a viewer, allowing at least one sister to have a life without tragedy would have been more satisfying.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It has the information I want. I like the way it is laid out. I hope it is available for the I phone.
B008476HBM|5.0|The movies I've seen based this title give it no justice...you really feel involved with the characters' point of view. I felt the ending had great closure.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I like it.  it is a good game.  You make your drawings and get the sugar in the cups. there is different colors to!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Thoughtful, beautifully written, interesting characters, woven together brilliantly. Thought provoking on the complexities of human beings and the choices they make.
