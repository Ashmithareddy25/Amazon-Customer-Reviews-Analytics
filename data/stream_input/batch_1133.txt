B002KSPKRS|4.0|I've been using the X41s since Christmas, and I like them a lot.  Being able to hear enemies behind you or across the room while they are walking is great.<br /><br />However, there are a couple reasons this product didn't receive a 5 star rating.  There are definitely better bass headphones out there.  These feel kind of shallow, and the X41s use batteries like they are going out of style.  Thankfully, I have 6 rechargeable AAAs, so it's not a big deal to swap, but I get maybe 10 hours of game time out of them.  I would recomend a wired version, because I don't sit far from my xbox/pc anyways.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I read a lot of books; some are horrible, more mediocre, and a few quite good.  I only read about one book a year that is so good I will remember it forever; Name of the Wind is this year's book.<br /><br />The author created a layered, gritty, fascinating world, where magic enhances all of the extremes of human nature.  Kvothe exists as two people:  a world-weary tavern-keeper recording his memoirs in a dark and troubled world, and a child coming of age, losing his family, struggling as an impoverished orphan, and fighting for control of his power and his life in a university for wizards.  The tavern-keeper's dialogue was carefully crafted to avoid heavy-handed foreshadowing, while leavening the darker episodes in the child Kvothe's recollections.  Even magic is conceived creatively in this book: each wizard must acquire a mystical knowledge of the nature of a thing to gain power over it (its \\"name\\"), which is both cool hocus-pocus and interesting philosophy.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, it is the richness of the characters that drive this book.  Kvothe and his friends have good and bad qualities, win and lose - sometimes badly - and feel like real people whose defeats and triumphs hit home.  I cannot wait to root for our hero in the next installment.  If you haven't read this book yet, don't waste another second.

0525422943|5.0|First I would like to thank both Gayle Forman and her publishers for the digital advanced copy of this book that I obtained through NetGalley. I was truly excited the moment that I received the little email notification in my inbox; I think I sort of scared the rest of the patrons in the library that day.<br /><br />I feel like I need to talk about If I Stay for a minute, because it was such an emotionally heartbreaking beautiful story that was told completely through Mia's eyes. It was her world, her story that she had to tell. And with Where She Went, the hat sort of tips to Adam and we finally get to see \\"where he went\\" in all of this.<br /><br />It's strange seeing the title Where She Went, when in my opinion, so much of the book was where he went, where Adam Wilde went when Mia left and how he found himself on a downward spiral slogging through his wasteland of heightened emotions and anger, grappling with the loss of her, falling out of love with the joy and electricity that his music once gave him, fighting with his band, dealing with being a famous rockstar and the obnoxious L.A. tabloids that he's become fodder for.<br /><br />It was easy connecting with Adam and his pain, because I felt it with him. His despair, that aching emptiness that he felt; I felt it with him too and it hurt. It was easy to see how he had become so angry, a ball of frustration that was wound so tight he was about to snap. But amidst all of the sorrow and the pain, there was a tiny sliver of hope lying just below the surface. It was sort of a breath of fresh air, a breath of life.<br /><br />I love the beautiful job that Gayle Forman did, in the way she so eloquently wove the past and the present together, piecing them just so that you could see how Mia's devastation and pain reflected in Adam's own pool of sorrow. What's so wonderful about both If I Stay and Where She Went is the fact that both of these books were written differently and could each be read as a standalone easily.<br /><br />But, if I were you, I would read them both honestly. Start with Mia's story in If I Stay and then finish with Adam's in Where She Went. You will not be disappointed, I promise.read them both honestly.

0060558121|4.0|American Gods was an enjoyable read from start to finish, I never found myself having to force myself to endure a lull in the book's quality and it was easy to get involved with the characters' adventures. Perhaps this is due to how busy the book was, with so many characters popping in from different mythologies or backgrounds and so many different plot points in development, Gaiman gave us plenty to focus on and changed the focus of the story enough to always keep us wanting more.<br /><br />This works well right up until the end, the bomb goes off with a fizzle...<br /><br />Some of the plot devices just seem forced (I suppose one can explain some of the character's weird actions as being the will of some god), and some of the foreshadowing is simply too obvious (although considering how often the deities comment on Shadow's intelligence, maybe the foreshadowing is supposed to be obvious to the reader even when it isn't obvious to Shadow), but it isn't terribly difficult to forgive this. Toward the end, however, when Gaiman ties up all the plot strings, it seems glossed over, as though the conclusion didn't have the right to be as epic as you expected. I don't get the sense the book had run out of energy, rather it did not consider the wrap-ups important enough to worry much about.<br /><br />The book is not straightforward and coherent, which is a strength, you feel the mixture of importance and insignificance that Shadow feels as most of the events of the book develop without his understanding or knowledge. You'll find yourself occasionally wanting to learn more about the groups that aren't explored in any detail. And, when you finally finish the book, you'll begin wondering what you'll pick up on your second time through.<br /><br />Criticisms aside, there is a lot of fun to be had seeing gods as American immigrants and in seeing how their world works as part of our own. Much like Shadow, you only get to skate along the surface of their world, it never gets a chance to become mundane.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but one star shaved off for the fizzled ending.hly recommended, but one star shaved off for the fizzled ending.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|It would be an understatement to say that I loved this book.  As I reviewed the book to an acquaintance of mine recently, I almost laughed out loud, since it seemed that there were these similar, yet disparate elements in the book.  There were almost too many sub-plots that seemed distracting to the story, when described to someone else, but they were adroitly enmeshed by Mr. McDougal.      The story is equal parts inspiration and exhilaration, and is a terrifically easy book to read.  There are plenty of other reviews that recount the plot, so I won't go into that here.  Just get the book, or Kindle-book, and hunker down for a phenomenal adventure that you will surely enjoy.

0307595862|4.0|Part of what makes Harry Hole (pronounced \\"Hooley,\\" if you please) such a compelling character is that he comes off as one of a kind. \\"Unhealthy attitude toward alcohol, difficult temperament, lone wolf, unreliable, doubtful morality and very blemished record.\\"<br /><br />Those shortcomings are a real good fit, just like the scruffy Doc Martens Hole walks around in.<br /><br />But that's a description, not of Hole, but of his \\"spiritual doppelganger\\" Gert Rafto. \\"Iron\\" Rafto, also known for his tenacity and unbending will, was the best detective on the Bergen, Norway police force, someone \\"made for the limelight.\\"  When he disappeared mysteriously on Nov. 2, 1992, Rafto had been investigating the murders of two women, both killed in a gruesome manner and under similar circumstances.<br /><br />In Oslo, exactly twelve years to the day after Rafto's disappearance, Birte Becker vanishes. The disappearance occurs during the season's first snow. In the middle of the night Becker's young son Jonas wanders outside where someone has built a snowman in the front yard. What makes the snowman so usual is that it faces toward the house, almost as if it were peering inside. It's wearing the pink scarf Jonas had given his mother the previous Christmas.<br /><br />Hole investigates. Soon he is connecting the dots, which lead him back to Iron Rafto and the mysterious disappearances of the two women 12 years before. Then in Oslo another snowfall, another woman goes missing. Her mutilated body is discovered in the forest. She had been decapitated. Nearby, standing as a macabre sentinel, is another snowman, the head of which belonged to the missing woman.<br /><br />Hole is now convinced he is chasing after a serial killer who seems to be choosing as victims mothers with young children. With each new snowfall someone builds a snowman and another mother disappears.<br /><br />\\"The Snowman\\" is the seventh mystery in the Harry Hole series. The first two wait to be translated into English; as a result \\"The Redbreast\\" is first in this series.

Usually both. Either a colleague or former lover gets killed, always violently, or he gets himself beaten senseless or ends up a victim of some sort of mayhem. In \\"The Snowman,\\" the killer seriously messes with his mind as he moves closer and closer to winning a very clever game of cat-and-mouse with Hole's sanity.<br /><br />Hole also is hurt physically. In a frenzied incident near the end of the hunt, Hole loses the middle finger of his right hand, severed he says as neatly as an egg slicer cutting through a hard-boiled egg. Hole likes the appearance of his new four-fingered \\"Cartoon Hand\\" and plans to have the middle digit stuffed so he can display it on his desk as a memento.<br /><br />As usual when I pick up a Harry Hole thriller, I start a notebook. That's a way to keep track of the Norwegian names, people and places. I also jot down what I suspect might be clues. The \\"Snowman\\" is dusted with them, and as usual, Nesbo throws one feint after another to keep the reader off track.<br /><br />Three times it appears the murderer has been unmasked.

B003Y5H5L0|4.0|Now this is a really good movie. Maybe even the best I've seen this year. It reminded me a lot of the Bourne films, except this time the person laying the beat downs and killing people left and right is a young girl that even Hit-Girl would envy. Basically she is trained to be a lethal assassin by her father, who has a background in the subject, in a remote cabin cut off from the outside world. Let's just say that some covert operation from years back had some loose ends that needed tying up, so of course they are now the targets, but boy did they mess with the wrong duo.<br /><br />I liked the strong European feel from the locations to the small character parts throughout. It was kind of like entering a different world. Throw in some well choreographed fight scenes that don't shy away from the violence despite the PG-13 rating and you've got quite the feast. It's even peppered with a number of light hearted moments that might bring a smile to your face. The directing, camera work, writing and music were also of high caliber, but the strong level of acting on display really stole the show.<br /><br />There are a number of really talented young actresses at the moment (Hailee Steinfeld and Chloë Grace Moretz for example), but Saoirse Ronan is in the same league if not even better. I had previously seen her in Atonement and The Lovely Bones and while I had issues with both of those films, she was the definite standout. Her line delivery and facial expressions continue to amaze for someone her age. This is her best role by far. You will believe she is not someone to mess with. Eric Bana is convincing as her father and Cate Blanchett turns in one of her best roles ever in my opinion. What a bad lady. Even the weirdo psycho killer working for Blanchett is memorable in a part that could have been a throwaway.<br /><br />Now for some minor negatives. A couple of parts did get a little slow and once the mystery is revealed it's more of a been there done that kind of deal, but overall Hanna remains a unique blending for an action film. One that actually has the smarts to stretch beyond the genre's normal limitations.<br /><br />And yes, I was so close to giving this 5 stars, but in the end I just couldn't pull the trigger.ns a unique blending for an action film.

0439101336|5.0|First of all I have to observe that Charles Dickens was born almost two hundred years ago, minus one year.  That is just amazing!  The man was taken out of school before he was eleven and yet managed to begin publishing his work at twenty-one, and finally being able to turn around the course of his family's debt at the age of thirty when he published this book.  There's something to be learned from his life as well as from this book.<br /><br />For those of you not familiar with the book, it is a story about a man named Ebenezer Scrooge, who is a miserly individual who, one Christmas-Eve Night is visited by the ghost of his long dead partner Jacob Marley.  His partner is there to tell him that he will be visited by three ghosts, (the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Christmases Yet to Come) in order to show him the error of his stingy and cold ways.<br /><br />The images Mr. Dickens produces with his words are astounding.  I could see the night sky swimming with forlorn spirits bemoaning the good they never did in life!  My heart ached for the girl realizing the man she loved was no longer the man before her.  I laughed at the Christmas antics of Fred's guests, and felt the pain of a parent loosing their child when the ghost showed it to Scrooge.  It moved me as only a truly talented author can move a reader, despite the century and decades separating our lives.  Though it is writen in the third person, the author engages the reader personally, speaking to you and giving his own personal opinion on a subject.  It was the first time I've observed that kind of writing to be honest.  For example when discribing Scrooge's nephew at Christmas the author writes that if you should know someone more blessed in a laugh than Fred, to introduce them and the narrator would cultivate the friendship.<br /><br />I have to say that all the Christmas Specials on T.V. can not compare to reading the original work.  The adaptations do well, but so much has to be left out or changed!<br /><br />Admittedly, his way of spinning a sentence is much different from today.  There are times I had to re-read a sentence or two to understand it better, not because it was written badly, but because the speech of the day has changed.  I found it a pleasant challenge though, and not too daunting in the long run cause he makes his world so vivid with life and action, you can see it all and even if the words said aren't exactly clear, the overall idea of what is going on is clear.<br /><br />Not surprising, I would give this a five-star review!  It is well written, has vivid images, believable characters, and flows well.  I would highly recommend it, but maybe caution the reader to have a dictionary on hand for any words that might be unclear.  Without one, I'm afraid the reader might find it more of a challenge than they thought.  I look forward to reading it again when Christmas time rolls around again, and maybe even before if I have the time!way of spinning a sentence is much different from today.

Though many of the effects provide an immersive depth, several (a butterfly, those lanterns) do seem to land in your lap.  The transfer is clean, with almost no crosstalk.  The sound mix, incidentally, is exceptional, with strong 7.1 separation.      Though not an exceptionally flashy 3D film (that would be the 3D Blu-ray of \\"Despicable Me\\"), the 3D set of Tangled is well worth the few extra bucks.

B001SF8G1Q|5.0|This album, one of Bob Dylan's quiet classics, has been given a much-needed sonic upgrade with this release. The former CD copy of this, by comparison, has a muffled sound: listening to this one is akin to having a bell jar removed from over your speakers.    Of the music, David Bromberg's guitar-fills are splendid, Dylan's voice, following the country croon of his previous two albums, is natural and affecting. The songs follow a general theme of domestic bliss, as exemplified in the lines \\"Build me a cabin in Utah / Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout / Have a bunch of kids who call me 'Pa,' / That must be what it's all about.\\" There is also beat poetry sung over a jazz backing, in the excellent \\"If Dogs Run Free.\\" \\"One More Weekend\\" is the perfect bar jukebox song, and Dylan's happiness can barely be contained in the title song, or \\"The Man In Me.\\"     If you don't have this album, then it's high time that you did.

The game did challenge the adults quite a bit, but we all had a lot fun.
0316044938|5.0|** spoiler alert **   I found this novel to be rich and oddly comforting. It helps instill a belief that even when life ends so ugly and in tragedy, there might be something more beautiful waiting for us on the other side - that those who die, never really leave us. My main fault with the book is the part in which Susie \\"uses\\" Ruth's body to meet with Ray again - it was a little too far-out-there for me and didn't exactly jibe with the rest of the novel.
0446691437|1.0|I just can't get through this.  It is obvious that the author has a major problem with procrastination but labeling it \\"the resistance\\" and having three or more references to \\"the resistance is\\" on almost every page takes me nowhere.<br />Where you taking me Steven? Gods and goddesses, wars and battles, Jung, Madonna, fluff on one page (\\"the Muse lights on our shoulder like a butterfly\\") and f-words on the next?<br /><br />And what kind of book is this anyway?  One or two paragraphs per page?  Like a thought for the day calendar or a blog. Is this art?  If this writing is a work of art then I'm the guy scratching his head in the gallery saying \\"I don't get it\\".
B0000AFX64|5.0|I saw this movie on TV a long time ago and liked it very much. When I surfed around on Amazon I found the DVD.<br />I know its the first movie from a trilogy and I should get them all but the trilogy was too expensive and I liked this specific first part the most.<br />I would call it a classic under the science fiction movies and it reminds me a little bit of the adventures from startrek Enterprise.<br />For me Battlestar Galactica vs. Starwars movies will Battlestar Galactica win.<br />For all science fiction movie lovers is that a good movie to have and also fun to watch together with the whole family.
1439102724|1.0|Jodi Picoult has always written timely, well thought out and constructed novels. She normally develops her characters so that I have a human connection with any and all of them. Not so in this book. I have tried to feel these people and cannot. Not the husband, the wife or the friend. I want to, I really do, if, for no other reason than to finish this thing. Ultimately, I've decided to let it go. The satisfaction in reading and finishing it isn't enough. Several friends and family are in the same boat. Nothing to do with the subject matter or theme. Just cannot get to know these people. This one is a stinker, imho.
B00005JKNC|5.0|This is a very beautiful and slow movie. The point seems to be comparing the beauty present in the film to the ugliness of our own time. This is some kind of conservative, pro-McCarthy film. I make my outragous claims on here but this time I provide evidence. Googling filmaker Frank Capra it turns out Capra was active in the anti-communist movement (so many people are noting that The Majestic was done in the style of Frank Capra). At one point in the movie Jim Carrey's girlfriend says, \\"It's not illegal to be a communists\\". This is what those few who support McCarthy often say (I guess to minimize their guilt). If only more of those on the political Left felt (rightly) guilty, the world would not be such an ugly place? I don't doubt the majority of those commenting draw the opposite conclusion, seeing this film as further damnation of the McCarthy era. Do they really feel that way? I suppose some do. Fear is a powerful force if it can alter perception itself.<br /><br />America's critic, Roger Ebert, liked this film. Mr. Ebert seems to support what the film is saying, or he goes along what the director is trying to say, despite it being 'conservative'. He gives this a sort of back handed, facetious, endorsement. He commented on one of the characters, the head communist witch hunter, saying there is a weak, snively character like this in every movie. I guess in the directors previous movie, The Green Mile, it was the rookie guard who was eager to participate in an execution. When the weak, whinny, communist hunter comes on-screen in this movie, I felt sorry for him. Just seeing him - with this movie comparing our time to the past - I suppose - I felt sorry for him. It turns out, he's the one who 'understands the communists' and is opposed to them. Guess he knew what he was talking about.<br /><br />There are a lot of 'speeches' made in this film, something that old movies often had I believe. Some of these are almost anti-speeches however. At one point Jim Carrey's character says, (while they're standing beside a graveyard) \\"people who stand up get mowed down\\". There's another where Martin Landau says something like, \\"sitting at home, watching a small box, that's not entertainment\\". This movie makes a statement about community. It didn't fully work for me. This movie takes place in California, where it's warm. Where I'm from it's cold enough you want to stay indoors, and there's not much to do but work inside a factory. Also, for me I think, community is a bunch of people who don't like me. I don't really understand 'community'. Just commenting. . . I think our technology will eventually bring us closer together. If it becomes advanced enough, we can be in our own house yet be right-there with our loved ones, and others, at the same time.<br /><br />In the film, Jim Carrey's character stands up to the government and the anti-communists. Then in an almost amusing turn, he stands up to his Hollywood bosses as well. For the most part, tho, this seemed a very honest movie.<br /><br />While a simple movie, the feelings it explored were very complex. Remembering it, I'm not sure I fully understood it. Not sure I fully understood the ending or the parts near the end (that the film may have been building up to or exposed earlier) - at least I'm having problems putting it into words. It seemed to be saying, as human beings, we're not good enough to live up to our own ideology; whether it be left or right, Marxist, capitalist, or fascist. That even the best intentions and the noblest ideals on the part of us as individuals can lead to negative outcomes. I don't think it was a negative movie, however.

0307593495|5.0|I have been reading Swedish books of this genre for more than 30 years and have read most of Henning Mankell's works,including all of the Kurt Wallander series. If this is really the last in the series, he has saved the best till last. He, and his translator, has captured an era and milieu so well. The story, based on known events, causes one to pause and reflect on how often one is misled by governments and their military. With Sweden's history of faux-neutrality the story is too believable. A gripping read!
0792160347|4.0|In my ongoing quandary to watch movies that define an era's unique style, I came across \\"American Gigolo\\" as a most suggestive one.  There are many things that stood out for me while watching this movie.  First and foremost, the fact that Richard Gere cast in the lead role appears to have been an absolutely perfect choice.  Not just because he is considered one of the sexiest men in Hollywood - an assumption I do not concur with - but because his inner egotistical sense shines through in this movie without quandaries.  Gere personifies to the \\"T\\" the typical selfish American Adonis who has achieved too much, too soon and in a far too easy way.  As such, he gets entangled in a web of deceit and murder, with everyone that he reaches out to turning their backs on him when he finds himself in desperate need of help.<br /><br />He finds a kindred spirit in his leading lady, the epitome of American classic and easygoing style, Lauren Hutton.  Hutton plays the role of a politician's wife, too lonely and unhappy in her marriage, and in dire need of distraction and affection.  She meets Gere by chance in a hotel restaurant, when he assumes her to be French while he overhears her talking to the waiter in that language.  Ever ready for business, he approaches her with his debonair style but wants to withdraw as soon as he learns, (a) that she is married, and (b) that she is a local.  But Hutton goes after him, dons the classical trench coat and heads to his apartment overnight.  From then on, their sizzling encounters provide for some of the movie's plot.  The rest has to do with the murder of one of Gere's customers, and his implication in it.<br /><br />Something that stroke me as very daring was the amount of nudity included in a movie that was filmed in 1980.  The shot of Richard Gere in full nude, with a far-sighted shot of his front genitals must have seemed quite a perversion for the time; as well as the close-up of Hutton's breasts being caressed by her lover.  Still, the nudity is tastefully done and never deviates into cheap porn.<br /><br />This movie also put Armani on the map of general fashion, and one can seriously take a very good and quick lesson in stylish menswear by watching the scene where Gere puts together his suits for the week.  All of his outfits are pieced together with great care, and the fact that Gere's shape is probably his best ever adds much to the movie's appeal.  After all, who wants to watch anything other than gorgeous bodies in a movie that hits all the landmarks of Los Angeles, from the Beverly Hills Hotel to its beautiful beaches?stefully done and never deviates into cheap porn.

B00371QQ2U|2.0|I can't believe nobody at Universal realized that this Blu-Ray has so many problems. First, it takes forever to load, at which point it tries to download a \\"fresh preview\\" (e.g., trailer) from the Internet. Once you get around that, it takes several minutes for it to load the main menu, simply presenting a Universal logo spinner. After that, you get a main menu that simply will not operate. Sadly, the behavior is the same on both of my Blu-Ray players: LG and Panasonic. The only Blu-Ray player that I've seen this work correctly on is a Playstation 3. Did Universal even bother to test this on anything else? What a RIP OFF this disc is....

0802798225|5.0|Brittnay and Alex are more than opposites. She seems to have perfect friends, family, and life in general. Alex is in a gang and has the reputation of being a bad ass who would kill you if you looked at him wrong. The only thing they seem to have in common is that the hate each other........a first. Alex can't back down from a challenge, so when his friend Paco tells him he could never get with Brittnay, he makes a bet of it. The thing he didn't count on was falling for her...HARD. Brittnay just wants to get an A on her chemistry project with him, but her resolve to not fall for him doesn't stand a chance against Alex's charm and other amazing qualities(yes.....including his amazing body) They are both willing to risk everything to be together, but when Brittnay wants Alex to get out of his gang, he doesn't know if he can. The story flowed and I loved reading from both of their perspectives. The ending was simply poetry and I couldn't stop smiling after I put it down. There's nothing original about the main concept of this story-two people who aren't supposed to be together can't help but fall for each other-(ex. Romeo and Juliet, Twilight, Evernight, Blue Bloods, Hearts at Stake.....), but I also found it different from the other love stories I've read. Evey line read smoothly and from the start, I couldn't stop. I really can't place my finger on the thing that made me fall for Perfect Chemistry, but it was just wow.     I had read a lot of other books where the girl in it 'seems perfect, but isn't', but Brittnay stands out the most in my mind now. I loved her to the bone because of her hard family life and the sacrifices she's made to help her sister and try to be what her mom wanted her to be. Brittnay emotions sprinted off the page and sank into my skin, leaving a mark. I admire the hard choices she made to be happy and to try to keep the ones she loved happy also.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I had heard great things about this movie and was looking forward to seeing it, hoping that it would be as good as Frozen River.  It was.    I knew enough about it to expect it to be rather grim but what I wasn't expecting were the moments in the film where courage, compassion and kindness overcame that grimness and humanized people that most of America regards as  trash.    While the larger story was Ree's incredible courage and determination in the face of poverty and brutality what I found most amazing was the subtle undercurrent that ran through it showing Ree's incredible capacity for love and forgiveness.    The moments when she was caring for her mother and her siblings, feeding them, helping them with homework etc. were the moments that really showed what her priorities were and what she was made of.    Sadly subtlety and character traits like compassion and selflessness aren't traits that are highly prized by a lot of the movie going public so you'll see several reviews by people who claimed that it was too slow and didn't have enough action.      For those who enjoy a good script, incredible acting ability (Lawrence should have won an Oscar for this) and photography so beautiful that some of the shots could be framed and hung in galleries this movie is well worth seeing and will haunt you for a very long time.

1400031001|4.0|Any Human Heart by William Boyd     William Boyd completes a neat literary double play in \\"Any Human Heart.\\"  He introduces his fictional protagonist, Logan Mountstuart, to his readers in the  biography  he wrote in 1998 about another fictional character  \\"Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928-1960\\".  In \\"Nat Tate\\" Boyd describes LSM, the initials Mountstuart goes by throughout,   as \\"a curious and forgotten figure in the annals of 20th-century life\\" who's \\"journal - a huge, copious document -- will probably prove his lasting memorial.\\" Then, in 2002 comes \\"Any Human Heart,\\" the fictional  journal, which is to be LSM's  memorial.      The title comes from the opening line of Henry James 1887 short story \\"Louisa Pallant\\": \\"Never say you know the last word about any human heart.\\" Clearly, however, LSM is the last word about what is in his heart. And if he ultimately tells you more than you want to know -- the journal format encourages skimming when it slows the book's pace -- you will admire his self-knowledge and come to trust  his candid self-appraisal of a life not always well spent.      The journal takes you on LSM's trek across much of the 20th century beginning with his school days soon after WW I to his dotage in the 1970's. It covers his WW II service as minder of sorts for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, his days as writer, journalist, critic,  art dealer, and teacher in London, Paris, New York and Nigeria, and his love life, always his love life. Rich man, poor man, but never a beggar or a thief. Lover, adulterer, husband, father, but bad luck or bad judgment prevent him from ever quite gaining the home life he seeks.       At the end you find LSM living with his dog for company in a small country home in the center of France. This chapter, the last of the nine journal periods that make up the book, is my favorite.  LSM neither exaggerates his life's accomplishments nor glosses over the failures. Rather, he takes the opportunity to savor his \\"curious\\" life. Ashe puts it in his last journal entry:  \\"What a time I've had - quel parcours - as the French say. . . . All my ups and downs. My personal rollercoaster . . . .a yo-yo rather, a jerking, spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child . . .too impatiently eager to learn how to operate his new yo-yo.\\"       As you read this book you will come to know, as well as one can, what lay in this human heart.      End note. LSM makes an earlier appearance in Boyd's fiction. As Louis Mountstewart, he shows up as the protagonist in \\"Hotel des Voyageurs,\\" a  short story collected in Boyd's book \\"the destiny of nathalie x.\\" (1995) Also written in the journal format, the story recounts LSM's seduction by \\"a fascinating worldly beauty,\\" the only other guest at the hotel where they were both stranded for the day.

1452101248|5.0|Plenty is the most gorgeous cookbook I have;  thus far, I have made two dishes:  Caramelized garlic tart, and eggplant with buttermilk/yoghurt topping with pomegranate seeds.  I think the carmlelized garlic tart was fabulous, but could have used twice the garlic designed, and half the cheese.  Nevertheless, it was fabulous.  The eggplant, on the other hand, needed a lot more spices:  garlic and za'atar.   In addition the recipe to bake at 200 degrees was not hot enough, and I had to turn it up to finish.  I think some of these issues suffer from metric to fahrenheit conversion, and perhaps from the difference between American za'atar and Mediterranean.  That does not however, explain the garlic!    The pictures lure you in and I intend to try several more recipes in the near future.

0393072231|3.0|I found this book long in comic-type sensations but short (no pun intended) in accuracy in a big way.     In the forward the author confessed being ignorant in financial matters and indeed the book confirmed it. Many people foresaw the coming financial crisis (John Paulson, Jim Rogers, Robert Shiller and the former chief economist of Merrill Lynch, to name a few) but they were ignored by the regulators, Fed, the rating agencies, and often their employers (if they had one). In general the book did not mention these people but instead focused on the less players. Of the villains the book did not mention Dick Fuld, Stanley O'Neal and other major players who slept through the crisis but instead chose to focus on some small fish named Wing Chau (by the way, a CDO manager is not an investor; he/she only manages the operation aspects of the CDOs). The author also failed to mention that the government policy to increase home ownership, while with good intention, helped to push the housing market to bubble level and many low-income families into sub-prime mortgages.    On the long side, the comic heros in this book are indeed interesting. But they are probably as greedy as the middleman in the banks; they just have a darker view of the market.

When I heard he had written a fiction book, I knew I'd buy it. Like many of my nerd brethren I have to turn off parts of my brain when I read the technical parts of some books. While I knew that wouldn't be the case here, I didn't expect to enjoy the story so much. In my opinion, Zero Day holds its own against other similar books like The Da Vinci Code. I found the similarities striking, right down the sleep I lost staying up all night to read it.<br /><br />If you enjoy thriller books, Zero Day is a good choice. The technical aspects are solid, without being overwhelming to non-nerds. The characters are interesting, and the outcomes are belieable. I would recommend it for my wife or my mom. They would both love it.<br /><br />tk
B003Y5H5L0|2.0|Marisa (Cate Blanchette) is a CIA agent who was in charge some years ago of an experiment to modify the DNA of babies in the uterus to try to create a better soldier. They used 20 babies of mothers who were considering abortion anyway. The project was terminated and Marisa killed all the babies and people involved as a cover up. Hanna was the only baby to escape with the help of another CIA agent named Erik. He then raised her as his daughter while hiding in the Arctic. There he trained her to be an assassin with the eventual goal of killing Marisa. The movie is about Marisa trying to kill Hanna and Erik and vice versa. Many innocent people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time were killed, mostly by Cate and her minions. All for this lame cover up. The acting, directing, and cinematography were good. But without a story you could care about, how good could it be?

B00005JMJG|5.0|In this depressing era where general schlock and laziness seem to be hallmarks of the entertainment industry, it's rare to find anything even remotely original. That's why I was so glad to finally see this wonderfully inventive film last week. Jim Carrey plays a man in a relationship with a spiky unpredictable woman (Kate Winslet) who tires of him and pays to have all memories of him wiped from her mind. He's pretty upset by this and decides to take his revenge by going to the same clinic and undergoing the same prodecure.    By this stage of the film I was interested in the idea, nothing more. The performances chug along and while the spectacle isn't that gripping, I hung on to see what happened. I'm glad I did. The movie really takes off as Carrey is knocked unconscious and lies down at home while the clinic's experts attach him up to their computers and start zapping Winslet out of his memory. Suddenly he half wakes and decides this might not be such a good idea. She appears beside him and they relive some of their past, all the time as the backdrop is wiped away by the clinic. They are left scrambling from memory to memory and then, in desperation, he takes her to parts of his past life that have nothing to do with her, all in a bid to hide from the eradication process. The scene turns into an elegy to pain, happiness, memories both good and bad, love, relationships and perhaps most of all regret, examining what could have happened had you decided to do something different at a moment which turned out to be a turning point, although you didn't realise it at the time.    I found this to be surprisingly moving. My wife, watching with me, thought it  bewildering. I can see how this film would appeal to some people and totally deter others. I won't say much more about the plot, which continues to twist away, save to say the movie takes no short cuts and ends with a scene I'll call intriguing, and leave it at that.    Eternal Sunshine won the best Oscar for originalscreenplay and fully deserved the honour.
B000M53GQS|5.0|The recently departed Gerry Rafferty left us with some terrific music. His legendary battle with the bottle meant that the later years were lean ones. But Another World and North and South deserve to be heard and it's a damn shame those recordings were neglected by fans and critics alike. Having City to City and Night Owl together in one package is a like a dream come true. These albums are arguably Rafferty's most consistent in terms of great tunes, brilliant musicianship and song sequencing. My old vinyl copy of Night Owl had a weird background hum that greatly affected my enjoyment of the disc. Must have been a bad pressing, or something. Anyway, while folks here debate whether this two CD set sounds as good as it should, I can tell you both albums are crisp and clear. I'm sure Rafferty was proud to have these wonderful songs represented in this way. Baker Street, with that iconic sax solo, is the one that made Rafferty famous and rich. But there isn't even a fair or middling track on City to City or Night Owl; it's all top drawer stuff. And I would argue that The Ark and Whatever's Written in Your Heart are just as good as Baker Street. Meanwhile, Night Owl features Days Gone Down, the great title track, Get it Right the Next Time and Family Tree. So, it's hard to say that one album is better than the other. Gerry Rafferty was an outstanding singer-songwriter and that distinctive, pitch perfect voice always wins the day for me. City to City and Night Owl are highly recommended! Now that he's gone, let's hope Rafferty finally gets his due.

0439023521|5.0|I actually took this book off of my younger brother's bookshelf at his suggestion. I was a little hesistant since he is ten years younger than me, in high school, and after reading the summary it didn't seem like my kind of read. I cracked it open on a Saturday morning and then could not put it down!!!      Even though the plot may seem a little brutal, I think it is written brilliantly and can not wait to read the next two books to find out what happens between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.
B004K4IZ54|3.0|Definitely not the best movie to come out in years.  I will rewatch the original and this one again but this is a cult film and those who like it \\"really really like it\\".  You can conjure images of this as a ground breaking film but your perception is clouded by the the beauty of its music since some five ratings feel that 60-75% of the film is its music, so.  Buy the CD or download.  With a decent film you should be able to respect it with the volume off.  There are way to many decent and very good films produced in the last five years to get stuck on this one.  A second point is Alice in Wonderland and Avatar are recent movie.  This might be the best movie that has come out last year but Inception was very good also.  So thank you for your positive review but this is a 3.5 to 4 star film that runs a little slow at times but is worth a second or third watch maybe for now.  It left me a little lacking like it was missing something.
B00000J7J7|5.0|I'm not a piano player so I won't try to describe the style or technical aspects of Brad Mehldau's playing. But Elegiac Cycle is most assuredly a brilliant solo piano recording. As others have pointed out, Elegiac Cycle wonderfully incorporates jazz and classical sensibilities to present something very unique. This is perfect background dinner music with friends over a fine bottle of wine. Having said that, Brad Mehldau has also created a work of art that deserves careful listening and close scrutiny through headphones. The robust, intellectual essay that is part of the insert explains the reason for doing songs built on the theme/concept of the elegy. This music may be elegiac in nature, but this doesn't feel like a sad album. The album essay shows that Mehldau can write with a profound understanding of all forms of music, culture and history. Most importantly, he can deliver the goods like no other young jazz player in the world. This is fresh, outstanding, original music. Mehldau continues to challenge and entertain in equal measure. If you get a chance to see this guy live whether in a solo or trio configuration don't miss it!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book - read in over maybe two and a half days only because I had to go to work.  Could not put it down and I read 50-75 books a year.  If you're a dog lover, I'd say 6 stars (or more).  It's similar to Marley and Me but in some ways more compelling reading due to the challenges the main character Denny faces as told by his dog Enzo.  Has jumped into my top five best reads of all time.  Warning, if you have any kind of heart, you will need a box of kleenix.

0786955570|5.0|In my attempts to nerdify my 5 year old girl, I've introduced her to D&D miniatures and have created table top games with these. She loves the miniatures and rolling dice, but I wanted to increase the complexity of our little games a bit and I had been eye-balling this (and the Wrath of Ashardalon) set and thought I'd give it a go to see if she'd get into one of these board games.<br /><br />First off, I was a little worried that this game would not be durable to withstand a hyper 5 year old girl, but after the initial un-boxing and then about an hour of game play, I can assure you that this product should withstand some decent use. I even let her pop out half the board pieces (she loved doing that) and I was happy to find that these popped out easily without tearing, etc. The miniatures are sturdy enough too (I think they are exactly the usual D&D Mini's, just not painted).<br /><br />In regards to the actual game, it took me about an hour to un-box and then read the instruction. The basic instructions did not make full sense right away, but after getting into game-play and following the included card with the steps of your round (Hero phase -> Exploration phase -> Villain phase), it sank in fairly quickly. I basically had to walk my daughter through the entire encounter but SHE LOVED IT. She quickly picked up on some of the basic math; i.e. she understood the basic mechanics of attack rolls having to be higher than the targets AC and she was able to do the basic math of a d20 + attack bonus (usually). Of course, what she couldn't do was read any of the cards or strategize her moves; but she was just happy to be playing a game and was eager to just do what Daddy told her to do!<br /><br />Then, let's talk about the treasure cards: she LOVES treasure (I taught her to call these \\"Phat Loot\\" cards! LOL) and she loved rolling the d20, even if there is no reason whatsoever to roll the dice, she just rolls and rolls.<br /><br />Anyway, Parents, if you are looking to nerdify your little kids without abandon, then don't be turned off by the recommended age of 12+ on this product, I think you can still find this to be a fun game with younger kids and may even introduce them to some basics of table top RPG mechanics.ndon, then don't be turned off by the recommended age of 12+ on this product, I think you can still find this to be a fun game with younger kids and may even introduce them to some basics of table top RPG mechanics.
B003VIW8DK|3.0|Let's get this out of the way, off the top. I love Bryan Ferry.  Roxy Music's Avalon is one of my all-time favourite albums. The solo records Boys and Girls and Bête Noire are terrific, with Frantic a much under-appreciated gem. I actually wore my Bête Noire concert t-shirt yesterday. And, it still fits -- although like a glove :( Getting to Olympia, I'm afraid the new Bryan Ferry album is not up to snuff. Sure it exudes the trademark Ferry cool. The voice is still strong and Olympia is well-produced with Rhett Davies on board again. But to these ears Olympia just sounds too calculated, too safe. The songs are just OK. It's the textures and the occasional neat David Gilmour or Phil Manzenera riff that rescues Olympia from certain disaster. However, the track Shameless with Groove Amanda is a train-wreck, which ruins a pretty decent start with You Can Dance, Alphaville, Heartache by Numbers. The cover art of Kate Moss is nothing special either. And in that respect, any album that lists \\"hair\\" and \\"make-up\\" in the art credits next to a listing of musicians is probably all sheen and gloss veneer. In the final analysis, Olympia is an album that you will play every so often because it is the latest Ferry. It's decent, but ultimately disappointing.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|When Final Fantasy VII Advent children was first released their was mixed reaction from a lot of fans of the series. While I still enjoyed it thoroughly and my rating then would be the same as now I wanted to put it simply with the added footage none of the complaints are viable anymore in my opinion. The huge gaping plot holes have been masterfully smoothed over and finally it feels truly as a complete add-on to VII's universe. I do say some things aren't made clear still if you haven't played the game but then again if you haven't why are you even watching this. They successfully added to the emotional impact of the film as well with bits and pieces here and there and helped you to reconnect with the old characters a bit more (though this was already it's strong suit) and even manages to connect you with the new characters as well. The style and length it adds to some of the fight scenes though unnecessary, are welcome and fit in seamlessly with the rest of the film. Overall this is a must own now more then ever for fans of VII and it's story. This lives up to it's subtitle of Complete and no longer leaves you wanting more because their are pieces missing still but leaves you wanting more simply for the joy of the connections with the characters and world surrounding it's mytho's. Buy this Blu-ray.
0761158820|5.0|My 8 and 5 year old both loved this.  they are fun little construction projects that don't take too long and have a lot of whimsey.  Unlike some other sets like this the number and variety is what makes this set special.  A lot of different artists contributed and different ones will strike you kids fancy.  A lot of entertainment for the price.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|After watching this much anticipated movie, I have to say it was borning, tedious and didn't have a plot.  Some nice ballet scenes, but that's it.  Acting was non-existant and the mother character was unbelievable.  In fact, the whole thing was unbelievable - especially the part where I paid for this movie.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|What is the cost of fame?  After a drunken accident on stage Kelly Canter (Paltrow) gets sent to rehab.  When her husband (Tim McGraw) takes her out early in order to start a comeback tour with new opening acts everyone realizes that it may have been to early.  With the help of opening act Beau (Hedlund) she tries to get through.  Let me start off by saying...I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  Easily the best movie about the music business since \\"Walk The Line\\" (yes, better then \\"Crazy Heart\\").  This movie focuses on three stars and thier rise and fall. Beau to me is what a young Bad Blake (from \\"Crazy Heart\\") would have been like.  Being a country music fan myself (not a Taylor Swift-pop country music fan), I loved the line Beau says after Chiles wants to make a pop-country album, \\"Just because something's on the radio doesn't mean it's good.\\"  This is a movie that doesn't pull any punches about the music industry and what the singers go through, which helps it in the long run.  If you liked \\"Crazy Heart\\", you will love this movie.  If you didn't like \\"Crazy Heart\\", you will love this movie.  Country music fan or not, you will love this movie.  Rent it, you won't be dissapointed.  I give it an A+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutely, I'm going to buy this!!!
0786178485|5.0|I had borrowed this CD set from my local library, and the narration by Nadia May is so wonderful, I had to buy a copy for myself.  Ms. May's British accent and interpretation of the story and characters is thoroughly entertaining.  She really brings this classic novel to life.  Highly recommended!
B002XTBE6K|4.0|This is by far the best adaptation of Emma yet. Romola Garai is brilliant as the effervescent, selfish, but good-hearted Emma. Johnny Lee Miller is a sympathetic but not overly dramatic Knightley. Their friendship is particularly well-built in this adaptation, and the way that the writers tied together Emma, Jane, and Frank Churchill is very well done and creative. The filming is beautiful. If you like Austen, you will love this!

His sugars were in the mid to high 300s, his a1c was 13.5 and this was with nearly 200 units of insulin a day.    Two months in...his mean daily sugars are in the 90s, his last a1c was 6...and I'm 20% into my goal for fat loss, a nice side benefit.  We still live for Saturdays, our 'cheat' day, but I noticed our weekly pizza is now thin crust, olive oil and garlic instead of pizza sauce, with heart healthy cheese and chicken.     Following the advice in the 4 Hour Body we are already seeing health benefits in addition to decent fat loss, without starving ourselves or marathon workouts.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This is another vote for the original theatrical versions of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

DO NOT WASTE YOU'RE HARD EARNED CASH AMERICA/WORLD ON THIS SET!
B0026OE2O8|5.0|This movie was startlingly beautiful! It also has a very relevant theme that everyone needs to learn about. I agree with other reviewers, it is startling to hear Glenn Close say that towns didn't exist till 600 years ago. How then would she explain Rome, Jeruselum or many other ancient cities? That did cause me to take the information presented in the film with a grain of salt, but I do believe that the film is a good representation of reality overall.
0446195529|5.0|Okay, naysayers; it's confession time:  even when a book is a bit far-fetched, I will still love the stuffing out of it.  Hell's Corner, for this reason, is my favorite of the Camel Club Books.  Lots of great characters on top of our usual cast, although I have to ask one thing about Oliver Stone:  he served in Vietnam several decades ago, and he's still hot and fit?  Man, this guy must have bionic parts and a plastic surgeon that hasn't collided with Bruce Kardashian--er, Jenner.<br /><br />One thing I find consistently admirable about Baldacci is that he always treats women with respect in all his novels, including the villains.  I love Annabell Conroy, appreciated the new kid on the block, Mary Chapman, even though there are twists with her too.  But get a load of Ms. Frieberg...um, on second, thought, never mind, because I don't want to spoil things.<br /><br />Basically this book scared the living crap out of me.  The technology had my mind reeling.  What if terrorists could actually invent weapons that threw dogs off the scent?  What if your own government is only serving in their own best interest?  Woops, that's been happening for a LONG time in real life now!  That's what makes this book even scarier.  More twists and turns than the wildest roller coaster at Six Flaggs, and supporting characters that launch surprise grenades at you when they're least expected, I couldn't put this book down because it was just that involving.<br /><br />If you suspend your disbelief and like non-stop action that keeps you riveted to the end, Hell's Corner is for you.  If you want realism by the numbers, go get a boring autobiography by some washed up has-been who acts Oliver Stone's age in real life.
0743537009|5.0|The 1980's Kubrick film was just a morsel of King's masterful creation.  From having watched the film and  having revisiting it on many occasions, the intrigue to read the novel came about.   Moreover, a well read; verbatim interpretation of King's novel would draw upon the imagery even closer.   Campbell Scott masters the drama as he reads through the entire book.  (People with short attention spans, myself included, are likely to be drawn into the book.  I was able to listen to the entire 16 hours plus in about a days span because I was so intrigued!)  This is my first King novel.  I never thought his writings would draw so closely to the details of the human condition.  I felt that this marriage of the human condition and the supernatural was so vividly drawn upon by King in the Shining.  There is a certain uneasiness about it.   The feeling was incredibly frightening; mission accomplished by a well written horror novel.

B004KZOWEG|3.0|Kindle readers: This book does not translate well to the Kindle platform.  Footnotes have all been replaced by (/), and they appear in an incoherent mass at the end.  In addition there are numerous errors of insertion in the text, floating phrases which make no sense and have obviously wandered in from previous or later chapters.<br /><br />Worse: No photographs or maps whatsoever, although the \\"photo credits\\" at the end of the book indicate that there were many.<br /><br />I'm very sorry I spent my Kindle money on this one.<br /><br />For the book's quality itself, it is a mixed experience.  As other reviewers have noted, the breathless journalistic style makes for readability but lacks depth.  The speculation about motives, psychological problems, possible meetings, etc. becomes unsettling and makes the book read, not like history, but like a National Inquirer expose'.  I feel that Casement's privacy was violated in that the journal entries about his sex life far outnumbered those about his other ideas and activities.  Stanley is vilified and his courage downplayed while his bad temper and shyness with women become his signature traits.  Leopold himself remains a curiously flat caricature.  The reader is left with a somewhat disturbing impression that a tragic subject approached with laudable aims has turned into a kind of cartoonish violence pornography.

B002ZG99Z4|2.0|So many missed opportunities in this movie.  Anarchistic and vulgar without being spot on, sharp or well-thought out.  As I sat there (I would clock 1 minute of this movie as having any decent laughs), I regretted that the actors did not get a chance to sit around with the script, improvise and rewrite it so that the movie was sharp.  It rambled and it seemed like everything was done on the spot, lending a very loose feel to the entire picture.  Our showing had two groups of walkouts within the first fifteen minutes of the movie.  The high points are the action sequences, exciting music and fantastic production design and scenery. As is, I can't recommend this movie.  I read in another review that it was like Princess Bride but that movie didn't feel scattershot as this one did.  Liking Pineapple Express like I did, I really wanted to love this movie.  But then again I had the same reaction to Get Him To The Greek even though I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  In both cases, the second films seemed lazilly written and tossed off rather than finely honed.  If it wasn't for the pluses in the production value side, I would have given the acting and story a 1 star rating.  PS  The highlight of the entire movie was a character named Courtney, a servant of Danny McBride's character.  He played what little he had quite well.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|A fine novel about boy meets girl and the nuances of love and life.  Don't be put off by the form; Nichols writes with a keen eye and the characters are interesting enough.

143350393X|4.0|The ESV study bible is, generally, a wonderful tool for any  student of scripture, bible teacher or minister. The features (diagrams, maps, articles, introductions, references etc) are excellent. This is really your one stop shop if you teach the Bible. The online feature is also a bonus. The articles on biblical ethics are from a very conservative angle, but they are still quite good.    Additionally, the quality of the cover and pages is good - not the best - but good.     The ESV is a \\"formal equivalent\\" translation. That is, it tries to translate the Hebrew or Greek words into the closest possible English word. And, therefore, it is a very literal translation. \\"What's wrong with this?\\" I hear you say. When you translate literally, sometimes Hebrew or Greek idioms, metaphors etc are not understandable in English, because the languages are different. Because we are dealing with a study bible here, the problem is not that bad because we can usually refer to notes for explanation of verses that do not translate into English well on a literal basis. But I wouldn't really recommend using a normal ESV for daily study because of this problem. I'd get the 2011 version of the NIV for daily use. A literal version is actually quite good for a study bible because it gives you a better sense of the Hebrew/Greek form and provides extensive notes to explain.    I think the ESV errs badly when it comes to certain gender sensitive passages like Romans 16:7 - the famous passage on Junia (or is it Junias?!). The translation is terrible and it seems to be intentionally biased because of the theological dispositions of the translators. ESV itself is a reaction to the supposed deferrence paid the the feminist movement in the TNIV and NRSV. The ESV translators over-stepped the mark here though. Not only do they provide a translation that is not known before, but even in the notes to the verse, they refuse to provide explanations as to why others have translated this differently - as they do with other verses. They simply say that the others are wrong. On the issue of Junia's gender, they give the alternate reading of Junias (which is meant to be a male name, but this name was unknown at the time of Paul's epistle). To their credit they concur with the majority of scholarship in that Junia was indeed a female. They don't, however, alert readers to the fact that some manuscripts have Junia as \\"Julia\\" - further evidence that Junia was probably a woman. This text is a hard one because whenever Junia is translated \\"Junias\\" (i.e. male), this person (whatever sex s/he is!) is always included as an apostle (see NASB). Whenever Junia (i.e. female) is rendered  she is excluded from the apostles. Hmmmm something fishy is going on here. Curiously, some conservative-preferred versions like the KJV and NKJV all render the person's name as Junia and include her/him as an apostle - leaving some ambiguity, but strongly hinting that the person is female and an apostle. The \\"liberal\\" versions take this interpretation and make it explicit. The ESV is very naughty in that it explicitly excludes the possibility that Junia was part of the apostle group. The evidence is not full proof, but it certainly favours the \\"liberal\\" versions. I think the KJV and NKJV are probably right in leaving some ambiguity here. But, as I said earlier, even these translations favour the liberal view on face value at least.    Anyways, the ESV Study Bible is a good purchase overall. I do recommend it for most, unless your theology is very liberal.

And with this, the twelfth edition, NOTHING TO LOSE, Reacher with the help of Hope's female cop, Vaughn, investigates Despair's secrets.  Far and away the worst of the series, it was slow and flat.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|99% of this movie is made to creep the hell out of you. It really has nothing to do with the Black Swan. They could have summed it up in 5 minutes that she lost her mind and became the black swan and gotten on with the movie. After about 5 minutes of watching her run away from hallucinations you put your head in your hands and find yourself wondering when the sex scene is coming.    It also is a complete replica of Darren's other movie, \\"The Wrestler,\\" where Micky Rourke plays a drugged out, crazy wrestler. As he had a heart attack previously in the ring, people are telling him to give up his passion, but he keeps pushing and pays the final price in the end, (DOUBLE SPOILER ALERT) jumping to his death in the end, just like \\"Black Swan.\\" Darren said that they actually were meant to be the same movie about a wrestler falling for a ballerina, but he decided it was too complicated.    Overall, if you subtract the 1 hour and 25 minutes of dead time in this movie, you have 17 minutes of mediocre dancing and some horrifying drug trance.

0141439661|5.0|At last I overcame my inner resistance and read past page 1, which had previously turned me off with its dry accountant prose. Very soon, already in chapter 2, I realized what good use Ms. Austen was able to make of her special style: the chapter narrates how the rich young man, who had made a rash emotional promise of monetary generosity to his 3 half sisters, is talked down by his rational wife, from 1000 Pounds for each of the 3, to precisely nothing for anybody, all step by step. Brilliant.<br /><br />The main theme of the story, the contrast between the two sisters representing sense and sensibility, which might have been called reason and emotion to be clearer, makes me suffer somewhat due to the impossibly complicated communications between the two girls. None of the two can figure out how to shed the stilts that they are constantly walking on. The dialogues are not easily bearable, and then, frankly speaking, both girls are silly chickens in their different ways. Their mother is a silly hen in her manic optimism. The fact that the main personnel of the story is not entirely admirable fades away in the course of the tale. We find ourselves exposed to the horrors of English gentry of the period, and one begins to realize that the silly girls are rather admirably nice people compared to most other people in this story. We meet more monsters than I would have thought possible in the setting.<br /><br />The mother hen has to pick up her nubile 3 daughters and move with them to a cottage in Devon after her husband dies and the house in Sussex, which had been his father's, is going to the girls' older half brother. In reduced circumstances, they all make the best of it. Marriage prospects and related hopes and disappointments are the most prominent subject of thoughts and conversations.<br /><br />Compared to her later colleagues like Dickens and Trollope, Austen, in this book, has the advantage of superior plot design. The later professionals, in the Victorian age, lived by their writing and their constant output for publication in periodicals. S&S, by comparison, is not driven by piecemeal design, not by the need to package publishable installments, not by ramblings from one subplot to another and back to the main story line. That is an advantage that one can appreciate, though it does normally not diminish my pleasure with the later writers.<br /><br />Austen's station in society is clearly reflected in her novel's world: the lower gentry, people who don't work for a living, but who are not wealthy. Her access to other levels of society must have been restricted by circumstances, hence she was wise to stick to what she knew. Her stories are sometimes called 'romantic', but hers was not the romanticism of the romantic school, which was essentially irrational. She was very rational and had a sharp eye for all kinds of falsities and pretensions. The novel's main effect on me, in the end, was a sense of despair about the lack of sensible life choices for women (and probably men too) in the suffocating closedness of the 'society'., lived by their writing and their constant output for publication in periodicals.

B00003OSSL|5.0|Incredibly fine movie-making.  On my \\"Top Twenty Best Film List.\\"  Fine cinematography, solid acting, three interlaced sub-plots, of which we witness a confluence of two.   Surprising subtlety and sophistication.  'Spose slow-moving for some, who only want dramatic action scenes, and comic-book characters.  And, the romantic jazz-filled sound-track is poignant and compelling.  There is the dual anguish of shared personal loss and betrayal, then a building intimacy between the two lead characters, mixed with a D.C. crime investigation, and the planning of the the woman's (a Congresswoman) senatorial campaign.  Wonderfully rich and satisfying.  ; )    ABSURD that this picture did not enjoy commercial success.  Apparently, this speaks to the low level of American taste and sophistication in recent years.
B0051OZ564|5.0|There are a lot of ways to describe this flick: surreal grindhouse, Gothic music video, video game movie, prison girl film, Heavy Metal meets LOTR etc. The movie for the most part was 5 stars. I didn't like the ending as they attempted to make a statement when none was needed. Baby Doll's mother dies. The step-dad was left out of the will so he kills Baby doll's sister and blames her during a goth version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (Annie Lennox). Baby Doll is committed to the Lennox asylum in Brattleboro, Vt. She is supposed to get a lobotomy in 5 days, during which she plans an escape.<br /><br />The asylum has a stage where the girls perform. Baby Doll has a dance which mesmerizes people, a dance, we the audience never get to see. While Baby Doll dances she goes into a trance or dream world where she imagines she is battling all kinds of creatures (zombies, orcs etc). This is all done to a great soundtrack and computer graphics. In this aspect, the movie reminded me of \\"Heavy Metal\\", a series of stories loosely connected by a plot. This actually works well, unfortunately when the movie deviates from it, it doesn't work at all. During the first dance Baby Doll is told to get certain objects so she can escape. During her subsequent dances she entrances the males in the audience while her fellow inmates steal the item they need. The item they steal relates to the surreal imagination of Baby Doll.<br /><br />No nudity, no sex, and the language was acceptable. Girls run around in short skirts with tight black hip boots. This is this generation's \\"Heavy Metal\\" movie, one that would be best watched on the big screen at a midnight showing.
1591843790|5.0|Bravo!  As an author, inventor, and marketer, Guy's book helped me to validate the majority of my guiding principles and to develop a more organized plan of enchantment for the market that I am trying to reach.  For the past several years, I have been unsuccessfuly trying to convince lenders that they need to adopt a new lending system [[ASIN:0470461683 Credit Risk Assessment: The New Lending System for Borrowers, Lenders, and Investors (Wiley and SAS Business Series)]], especially in the wake of the financial crisis. This, despite being a likeable, trustworthy person with a great cause!  So, I wondered \\"What am I doing wrong?\\"<br /><br />After reading Enchantment, I have a much clearer idea of where I may have fallen short, and I am re-thinking my strategy and considering how I can utilize the concept of immersing people (Chapter 5) to enable my intended audience to connect with my idea by engaging them, making it real for them, stirring their imaginations, painting a vision of what is possible, and issuing a call to action.  I found significant value in Guy's advice in Chapter 7 on ensuring lasting enchantment by: 1) building an ecosystem (Guy identifies the key players and discusses what motivates them to join the ecosystem), and 2) having a plurality of the right personas (he identifies each persona, provides the rationale for including it, and explains the positive interplay among them).<br /><br />In summary, Guy organized a lot of solid practical advice on how to win people over to your cause, and he presented it in an easy to read style, with lots of interesting anecdotes from his own travels and escapades.  I was as much inspired, as I was enchanted, by Guy's words.  This is a must read for fellow inventors, entrepreneurs and marketers, and would be a welcome addition to just about anyone's personal library.

B0041KKYCY|2.0|This is a remake of the old 1980's rape genre films for sick people. The plots are basically the same. A woman is raped. Woman gets revenge. Sometimes it is an abduction or a home invasion, or in this case, a woman is taken in her cabin by a bunch of rednecks. As compared to the original, the nudity was less in the remake and the rape scene less graphic. There I said it. Oh yes, the characters are more developed and the torture inflicted by the woman is a tad better, but is that why people watch rape films, for character? The same could be said for the remake of &#34;Last House on the Left,&#34; they watered down the rape and nudity. I can't believe with all these silicon soft core stars, they could not have picked something with more eye candy for the starring role instead of someone who can act.<br /><br />Decent folks will want to stay away from this movie. Sickos would be better off with the original or a David Hess film festival. Anyone up for &#34;A Dirty Western&#34; remake?
B003EYVXTG|4.0|\\"Winter's Bone\\" takes place in The Ozarks, a mountainous, wooded region of Missouri where the people are dirt poor and the meth business is prosperous. It's an unflattering portrayal, but brutally realistic.    Jennifer Lawrence stars as Ree Dolly, a 17 year old who has to take care of her two younger siblings amidst the harsh environment of the Ozarks. We soon find out that Ree's father, Jesup, is a meth cooker. Jesup has gone missing, and he put the family's house and surrounding land up for bond; if he doesn't show up for his court date, the family will lose everything. Ree, then, has the arduous task of having to hunt him down. The first half hour of the film involves Ree trekking across the stark landscape, house to house, asking her neighbors if they know anything. Apparently, just showing up at a neighbor's doorstep is considered a great offense by quite a few in this area, and the line between friend and foe is never clear. She does eventually find an ally in her callous, yet ultimately caring uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes). Together, they try to figure out where her father might be or, if he's dead, what happened. Throughout all of this, Ree's younger siblings are shown lounging around the house, bored to tears. They jump on trampolines, climb on bails of hay, or just lie around to occupy their time, seemingly just waiting to grow up to either join the meth trade or the Army.      Having recently seen \\"True Grit\\", it was impossible for me not to draw comparisons between the strong wills of the two female leads. But while Ree Dolly has all of the determination of Maddi Ross, she has none of the naiveté. No, Ree Dolly is hardened to the territory, and knows exactly how rough the people of her community really are. She has no qualms with telling people she's scared of them, despite never showing it on her face. Hats off to Jennifer Lawrence. Overall, \\"Winter's Bone\\" is an impressive film, if just in showing the ravages of methamphetamine on a rural area. The plot never really progresses in a satisfying way, and the climax (or lack thereof) left me a bit underwhelmed. However, in terms painting a picture of a culture I knew almost nothing about, it was very well done.

B004WCTLNY|2.0|\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is a blend of genres: Science Fiction, Romance, Political Thriller. For the first forty mintues, the film seems to not really know what it is, beginning, oddly, as a portrait of a young politician, the personable yet rowdy David Norris (Matt Damon). Unfortunately for Norris, it seems his political career may be over after a picture of his butt emerges in the newspaper. However, after a chance (or is it fate?) encounter in the men's bathroom with none other than the beautiful Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), he is inspired to make the single best political concession speech of his career, a sort of exposé on the phoniness of politics.    Too much time is devoted to his political campaigns, with interviews from various cable news entities (Jon Stewart) thrown in there in an attempt at authenticity. All the while, we're occasionally seeing glimpses of sinister, middle aged men in trench coats and fedoras, and an overall sense that something is amiss. These men (?) walk in synchronized fashion, as if rods were up their butts, and occasionally share in small, awkward conversations with each other e.g. \\"You should take some time off; even WE need vacations sometimes\\". These adroit, uncomfortable beings are apparently angels, or something. \\"Some have called us that\\", says Anthony Mackie, straining to maintain a straight face. They are members of The Adjustment Bureau, a team of supernatural business men who control everything. Yes, everything. For reasons unknown, it is of the utmost importance that David Norris not fall in love with Elise Sellas, and whenever Norris attempts to be with her, he is thwarted by this mysterious bunch.    The worst parts of Adjustment Bureau are without a doubt when the bureaucrats attempt to explain their existence. \\"What about free will?\\" bursts Damon, in a fit of bewilderment. They explain that they've tried free will, but humans have a tendency to screw things up when left to their own devices (hence, this movie). \\"We (the adjustment bureau) brought you to the height of the Roman Empire\\", explains a deadpan Terrence Stamp. \\"Then, we stepped back. We watched as you destroyed yourselves; the fall of the Roman Empire, the dark ages. Then we came back in, and gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment. Then in 1910, we stepped back again, and watched you descend into World War I, World War II, and then bring yourselves to the brink of destruction with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Since then, we've stepped back in, before you altered the plan so irreversibly that even we wouldn't be able to save you\\". Well, he knows his history! Not only is it absurd to think that this supernatural bureau went back and forth between controlling human behavior and giving us free will. But also, I guess we're supposed to assume that all of the atrocities that occurred while under the influence of the bureau were, actually, performed according to a devised plan? Slavery, the Civil War, Vietnam, September 11- these are all events that apparently occurred under the Bureau's divine influence. \\"Do you ever wonder if the plan is wrong?\\" submits the bold Anthony Mackie. Hmmmm, let's think about that. Or better yet, let's not.    The movie then descends into laughable parody. The bureaucrats can open doors, and travel to any location through the doorways, as long as they're wearing their magical fedoras. This makes for some ridiculous chase scenes through baseball fields, banks, and my personal favorite, the Statue of Liberty. \\"Teach me how to use the doors\\", says Matt Damon, in a pivotal scene. Spoiler alert: all you need is a fedora, and to turn the doorknob clockwise. The bureaucrats are so powerful, and can do so many things, that it is often extremely frustrating to watch how horribly incompetent they are. Haven't they been doing this for thousands of years? Even Terrence Stamp, the bureaucrat whose nickname is \\"The Hammer\\", has a tough time quelling the unstoppable force that is Matt Damon.    The saddest part about \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is that there's potential here for a good movie. Matt Damon is excellent as the likable politician, and the chemistry between Damon and Emily Blunt is solid. I truly think this would have been a better movie if there was no adjustment bureau, and it was simply about a young politician forming a relationship which could potentially threaten his political career. I wish I could adjust this movie's fate, abandoning it's silly premise for a simpler, better one. But I can't. Why? Because I don't own a fedora.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I have to agree with the majority here, the unedited theatrical versions should be made available as an option to us fans and collectors. As someone who will never (no exceptions) watch an edited movie or television show I will not now nor ever purchase this edition being released for any amount of money and I would urge anyone reading this review to do the same. I also agree that the long awaited episodes I through III were extremely disappointing and not up to the standards one would expect from the likes of George Lucas. Although I liked Nalalie Portman in her role I thought that Christian Haydensen was woefully miscast as Anakin Skywalker and I thought that Episode I was more of a childrens movie than anything else. I guess in the end it comes down to this; Mr Lucas has the right to release his movies in any version or format he sees fit but I also have the right not to buy them. Hopefully, the vast majority of fans will see it this way as well. Let's hope that eventually Mr Lucas will relent and do the right thing both for his fans and his reputation.
B004G600A4|4.0|i'm a big fan of the old school disney movies like robin hood, aladdin, the little mermaid etc, so the past 10 yrs or so of disney movies have been very disappointing for me. tangled, was a breath of fresh air. it's finding nemo/up humor mixed with disney princesses. i thoroughly enjoyed it. i'd heard bad things about the movie when it was changed from \\"repunzel\\" to \\"tangled\\" but i disagree. i think it was a good mix of a more humorous aladdin (character) for flynn and repunzel is an ariel mixed with a boo from monster's inc. : )
B0026IA0QS|5.0|Dear Diary,    Today I have lived. I have been introduced to my new favorite movie. Granted I have an odd sense of humor and consider myself a little left of center. This movie had everything I didn't know I wanted. It was either awesome-ly horrible or horrible-ly awesome. An elephant funeral, lavish costumes, drama, mystery, comforting clowns, a twist ending... did I mention an elephant funeral! I knew I wanted this in my dvd library 10 minutes in. It gave an idea for this year's halloween costume. Best. Movie. Ever.     Fin,  Mel
B0034G4ORM|1.0|\\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" is a big, loud, stupid movie. That much is clear from the very opening. Explosions greet us in the first frame, and we have that instinctual feeling that those explosions aren't going to cease until the final one. After a few opening minutes of people running and screaming, and more explosions, the director (Jonathan Liebesman) seemed to remember that there needs to be a bit of exposition. BORING! Text across the screen then reads: \\"Invasion- Minus 24 Hours\\". What? You mean yesterday? Why \\"minus 24 hours\\"? Whatever. So then we're introduced to the platoon that we presume we'll soon see fighting aliens. It plays as a checklist of soldier stereotypes, as opposed to real people that we might care about. Aging soldier who just got demoted, check. Young soldier who just got promoted, check. Soldier who lost his brother in combat, check. Soldier with PTSD who has to visit psychiatrist, check. Soldier who's a complete newb and is still a virgin, check. There's a lot of characters, each given a few minutes of screen time. I guess it's supposed to make us care about them, so that when they get shot at, and possibly die, we'll care. But none of them are particularly likable, and there's so many characters I had a hard time keeping track of them.    Meanwhile, the camerawork on display is some of the worst I've ever seen in a major studio release. It's done in the popular \\"shaky cam\\" documentary style, but for no particular reason. The framing is always a little off, or a lot off, with the cameraman seemingly just placing the camera at random places and starting to film. In other words, with this film, \\"documentary style\\" is code for \\"bad camerawork\\". The plot is also often hard to keep track of. I was actually paying attention throughout the whole movie, and still had a hard time keeping track of what their specific mission was at any given time. Basically, it begins with a cluster of meteor showers, harboring violent alien lifeforms, hitting off the coast of about 20 major cities across the globe. Soon after the invasion, Aaron Eckhart's platoon is sent out to go rescue some civilians from a police station. After that, they're basically cut off from the outside world. They can't travel by air, because the aliens have sophisticated drones piloting the sky, and they have to traverse across the city, shooting any aliens that get in their way.    Soon, with the help of an air force intelligence officer (Michelle Rodriguez), they discover that the flying drones that have been giving them problems are controlled by a large, floating control center. If their crew can simply take out the control center, the American military could stand a fighting chance of winning the battle. It never seems very realistic that these soldiers are faring as well as they do. The aliens in this film are vastly technologically superior, and it really doesn't make sense that they wouldn't be able to kill a few marines shooting from behind wrecked cars. At one point, the entire platoon (and a few rescued civilians) get on a large orange bus, and begin to drive through Los Angeles, while dozens of drones are flying overhead, shooting at other random stuff. Are they really too busy to notice the bright orange bus that's cruising by?    The dialogue is astonishingly bad. I would say that it seems like it was written by actual marines, but that would be insulting to the marines. Hoo-rah! \\"Do you think they're extra-terrestrial?\\" asks one soldier. Let's see: they came from space, and they're ALIVE. Yep, I think that counts as extra-terrestrial. But most of the dialogue is simply orders being barked, and affirmations being barked back. The words are often unintelligible, and seemingly unimportant. It's the intensity that they're yelled with that matters.    There are a few redeeming qualities, believe it or not, in \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\". First of all, it helps that the film isn't trying to make any sort of political message, besides maybe \\"marines are awesome\\". I'm so sick of sci-fi films trying to shove political or social awareness down my throat, it was kind of refreshing to see a movie that was just too dumb to care. Also the visual effects were pretty awesome, it's just too bad they didn't have a better team of camera operators to effectively film them. I probably went into this movie with too high of expectations. The trailer was awesome, but then again, so was the trailer for \\"Clash of the Titans\\". Like with that film, I couldn't help but feel slightly duped, having been lured into a film simply because I thought it looked cool. But unlike \\"Clash of the Titans\\", this one was actually enjoyable. If you're into seeing the world explode without having to think about anything, this movie is definitely recommended. Just don't be a fool and spend $12 on it like I did.
0938045695|5.0|This book is phenomenal.<br /><br />I have read a variety of books about kettlebells and watched countless DVDs.  This one is the absolute best.<br /><br />Kettlebell exercises are simple (do NOT confuse \\"simple\\" with \\"easy\\" !!!).  Pavel spends a lot of time breaking down each exercise into stages and always emphasizes the importance of proper technique and safety.<br /><br />The Swing, The Get-up, The Clean, The Press, The Clean and Press, and The Snatch are the techniques that are covered.<br /><br />The Swing is the most beneficial aerobic exercise I have ever done (made all the more intense because of the strength-training and flexibility components).  I dislocated my ankle a few months ago and have been unable to run as I normally would.  The Swing has allowed me to not just maintain my level of cardiovascular fitness, but improve it.  All with no impact and minimal stress/torque on my ankle.  Awesome!<br /><br />Pavel is also conscious of the fact that not all people will be able to do all of the exercises without building up to them.  Box squats, vertical leaps, etc. all help you build up to being able to do the swing properly.  If you take the time to work on the basics, your time investment will be returned to you.<br /><br />Working with kettlebells is the most time-efficient workout I have ever experienced.  Cardio, strength-training and flexibility all in one workout.  Anyone who complains of not having time to workout needs to get their hands on a kettlebell and some of Pavel's instructional materials.  Fifteen minutes of working with a kettlebell beats hours in a gym any day.<br /><br />I have this book and the accompanying DVD and I would recommend doing both.  The book is a great resource for the history of kettlebells and for detailed explanations of movements, techniques and advice.  The DVD is great for putting it all together and seeing proper technique in action.  One of the main criticisms of the DVD is that it is instructional only and does not include a workout routine that you watch and workout with at the same time.  Do you understand why there isn't a routine?  Because kettlebell work is about repetitions with proper technique.  Do you need to watch Pavel do 200 swings in a row?  No.  I would, but that's for purely aesthetic reasons (I'll admit it: He's HOT).  You don't need a routine laid out for you because once you have good technique, it's all about just building up your strength and conditioning with more reps.<br /><br />My one recommendation would be to get a heart rate monitor (you won't believe how many calories you burn!) and it helps you keep in the proper heart rate zone for whatever your cardio-conditioning goal is.<br /><br />Pavel does ham it up with the evil Russian drill instructor persona, but it's endearing.  This man knows his stuff.

B003Y5H55G|4.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, those lovable Brits from \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\", are back. Pegg and Frost star as Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings, two grown-up nerds who've come to America for Comic-Con and a tour of all the famous alien hot spots. It's the ultimate nerd \\"holiday\\", as they would call it. What they didn't expect, was actually coming across an alien, which of course is what happens. The alien is Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen): he's on the run from the FBI, and he really needs a ride in their RV.    Ironically, part of what makes the character of Paul so unique is just how normal he seems to be, which is as refreshing as it is unlikely. The character of Paul is basically if Seth Rogen was an alien, which again, is totally fine with me. There's something comforting about Paul being essentially human in nature, yet not at all; he's cool, easygoing, down to earth (pun intended). He smokes (cigarettes and weed), swears, gets drunk, and references pop culture. It's hard not to like Paul.    Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have built-in chemistry, and Rogen sidles in to the mix quite nicely. Overall though, there begins to be too many supporting players, with Kristen Wiig tagging along as the evolution-denying religious nutcase (she has a t-shirt with Jesus shooting Charles Darwin), the three FBI agents on their tail, two rednecks (three if you count Wiig's dad), and Jane Lynch, Blythe Danner and Sigourney Weaver all making small appearances. None of these people give bad performances (Bill Hader is predictably hilarious as the bumbling FBI agent), but a lot of times I just wanted more focus on the three stars of the film.    The movie does get caught up a couple times in lambasting religion, but at least it doesn't hijack the plot (I'm looking at you, \\"Invention of Lying\\"). And the stereotypical bible-toting, shotgun-bearing redneck comes close to ruining the whole thing. Like Paul says, \\"Whatever, dude\\". Overall, the movie \\"Paul\\" is a lot like its title character. It's goofy, light-hearted, maybe a bit thin, but overall a great time and leaves you with a smile on your face.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I waited quite a while before buying this book simply because I wasn't sure if I would like it.  I should have listened to my gut.  There is so much potential here for a great, kick butt adventure, however, this book just is boring.  You have this powerful witch who can do anything and a powerful vampire who leads a secret knighthood and I would expect sparks to fly between them.  They eventually end up \\"married\\" but never consummate their union.  And that is not the only unbelievable part of the book.  The author spend so much time talking about old historic books and what happened back then, she should have just written a historic novel.  It would have been more interesting.    The ending was horrible.  We are left dangling as to what happened to the main character and her \\"husband\\" after they go back in time to try to train Diana in the ways of witchcraft.  Yeah, the dark ages were the perfectly enlightened times for that, I'm sure.    I just was so disappointed because I kept hoping the next chapter would be where things would pick up and it would finally get to be a fun read, but it never happened.  I don't want to read about how everything looks when I read a book. I want action, sex, and adventure.  Not how many times Diana rows her boat down the river and nothing happens.

0670022411|5.0|Deborah Harkness' first novel, The Discovery of Witches, isn't your typical vampire book.  There are vampires, true, and witches and daemons, but this book is so much more than just an ordinary paranormal.  Harkness is a professor at USC and The Discovery of Witches is a scholarly novel.  Not only are the leads academics, but reading the book is an education in itself.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Harkness offers information and theories about magic, genetics, evolution, wine, literature, art, botany, history, religion, and a host of other topics.  She includes just the right amount of intellectual info - enough that you feel you learned something but not so much that your brain cramps up.<br /><br />Diana Bishop is the last descendant of the powerful Bishop witches, but after her parents were murdered when she was seven, she disowned magic.  Instead, she is a respected historian specializing in medieval alchemy.  During her research at Oxford, she requests an obscure alchemical manuscript titled Ashmole 782.  No one has been able to access the manuscript in 150 years yet the book makes itself available for her and offers her its secrets.  Suddenly, Diana finds herself threatened by an assortment of witches and daemons, and shadowed by one very hot, sexy vampire.<br /><br />Over several centuries, Matthew Clairmont has become a master of many things - genetics, wine, and yoga, to name a few.  He's on unfamiliar ground with Diana, though.  Vampires and witches are natural enemies, yet Diana and Matthew are drawn to each other in ways they don't understand.  As the threats against Diana become increasingly violent, she turns to Matthew to understand why her acquisition of Ashmole 782 has set off a creature frenzy.<br /><br />I loved this book - it was suspenseful, glamorous, romantic, fanciful and intellectual (whew!).  Harkness is a fabulous writer and I felt like I was living the book along with Diana - I even felt myself getting panic attacks when she does.  Despite the magical aspects, the places and characters felt very real, and the strong family ties that drive both Diana and Matthew were authentic and emotional.<br /><br />The Discovery of Witches is not a quick read - I'm a fast reader and it still took me several days to finish the book.  It's 580 pages, the print is small and the text is dense.  Plus, there is so much fascinating information that I didn't want to miss anything.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't realize it was part of a trilogy until I got to the cliffhanger at the end, and unfortunately for all of us, Book 2 isn't due out until 2012.  Harkness is calling the books The All Souls Trilogy, a title that gives me the shivers (in a good way).<br /><br />If you're unsure whether this book is for you, check out Harkness' gorgeous website, or Matthew and Diana's profiles on Facebook (no joke!).  As for me, I'm giving it the best endorsement I've got - I got this book from the library, but it's so good that I bought my own copy.

0399250573|3.0|***No spoils inside, so do not worry***    Okay, so I have been looking forward to reading this book for  a while now. I consider myself to be a true alex rider fan; I get so involved to the point of me crying and swearing on occasion. Over the course of the series Anthony H. really helps us connect with alex, having us feel his pain and all. I just finished this book and have got to say that I am really pissed off. I had really come to care about alex and to have the book play out the way it did was aweful for me. I hated what Anthony turned alex into and what he did to him. I know this is just and book and their isn't really a teenage spy named alex rider out their, but I know if you are a true fan like me that you really care about the characters in a book. I do not want to give anything away so I cannot say anything else. Do not let this review make you not want to read the book though, you have to read it and push through to the end and suffer just like I did. Read it, but if you want a happy ending, stay away because this book will only want to make you say some pretty bad words and cry. :(

B003YL4L0W|5.0|I loved this book...I couldn't put it down.  I was prepared for another depressing story about a dying/sick child and was pleasantly surprised. There was an expected death , but I loved that the focus on this story was not sadness or sickness, but life and love. Generally, I find her books too depressing (especially as a mother myself), but thought this was well written, thought provoking story about two people who fall in love under unusual circumstances.  The reason I loved this book was that it emphasized that what defines a family is not man, woman, & child, but two or more people who truly care about each other, and who are willing to go to extrordinary lengths to be together.  These characters gave me a glimpse into what injustices and stereotypes gay couples face...something of which I have no concept.    This story teaches a great lesson about humility, understanding, and the true meaning of family.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book was awesome. Patrick Rothfuss really has a way with his characters. Kvothe manages to treat the world as we all wish we could; with a natural style and aggression that's similar to an italian leather shoe in the balls. I hate the fact that the publisher set the price so high, however, this book is certainly one of the best i've read in a long, long time.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|Although the plot of this book could have been good, it moved along so slowly that I lost interest. The characters were flat and not engaging. I have not seen the TV show and nor do I care to see it if it is based on this book.
1400079144|2.0|Ten pages in, I told myself, \\"if this thing ends at the ....., I'm going to be pissed.\\"    Well I braved every 3 page chapter and that's exactly what happened.  I find it pretty amazing this took so long to write.  Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code was really great trash - thought provoking, fun, but shallow trash.  It was simple minded fodder for a three hour flight.      This one makes no sense, the villain changes every chapter or two and the payoff, as i eluded to, is one you may guess without even reading the book.    I've read jokes on fudgesicle sticks that were more clever.  Buy it used or just watch \\"National Treasure.\\" I can't believe I recommended that movie, but well there you have it.
0393960188|3.0|Let me just start this review with that fact that I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan. I love the language and I think it's a shame that we don't speak like that anymore. However, this is not my favorite Austen book. There is not a lot going on in this book besides the pining of Anne Elliot and while I was reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen. Although I do have to say that I LOVED the ending, which I won't go into cause I do not want to spoil anything for future readers. I do not want to discourage anyone from reading this book because Austen is great either way but for me personally this book was just a little underdeveloped in comparison to her other novels. Still a must read though for any Austen fan!!!

069111966X|5.0|\\"Schule des Denkens\\"  means school of thought. The title of the original manuscript reveals the motivation for this book: to teach better. Polya wrote it as a guide on how to lecture mathematics. But only the publicized edition, after Polyas migration to the United States tells in plain English what its good for a broad audience: How to Solve It. I am not a teacher, the didactic musings of a  lecturer would produce not more than a spark of curiosity in me. But \\"How to Solve It\\" describes a general procedure for problem solving. This freaks me out! Polya hides this endeavor in favor of the didactic justification, and only later in  the book will reveal that its content is a Modern Heuristic to \\"understand the process of solving problems, especially the mental operations typically useful in this process\\" [p. 129]. The book is divided into four parts, I will discuss them briefly.    Part I: In the Classroom  This 32 pages are all you need to grasp his algorithm of problem solving. Good ideas are simple and the procedure proposed is nothing counterintuitive. You could easily come a similiar conclusion by your own: What is the first step of problem solving? (1) Understanding the problem. What is the next step? (2) Devise a plan. Then?(3) Execute the plan. And finally(4) Look back.   Mightily impressed? Then you are a lobotomized PowerPoint disciple! But follow Polya in a Socratic dialog with the classroom and look into the train of thoughts of an educated problem solver. There are many subtilities to discover.By reading this chapter, more than once I had moments of Heureka!, when Poly guides you to ask the so called right questions and instructs you how to take a different point of view of the problem.    Part II: How to Solve it - a Dialog   The second part compresses the problem solving procedure, the ars inveniendi, in a summary of two pages. I did not gain from this, but it might be helpful as a short rehearsal when time passes by.    Part III: Dictionary of Heuristic  This is a 200 pages collection of heuristics to use as a pattern language for problem solving. The autor advices to take your time read this piece by piece when you are struggling with problems. Which I do.    Part IV: Problems, Hints, Solutions  These 8 pages are filled with exercises and smart hints how to approach the individual problems.    Conclusions  Polya opens your mind for solutions. I will tackle future hard problems only with Polya's algorithm and benefit from the careful order he imposes to the confused mind.Albeit written for teaching mathematics, I suspect that Polyas work is useful not only for quantitativ problem solving, but for qualitative problems too. Here, I have no proof and only the application of it will tell. The book is easy to read, and you might master the first fundamental part \\"In the Classroom\\" in 3-5 hours. It is also a really cheap book, 13-something Euro, and if you are a problem solver you will need and enjoy it.
0307454541|3.0|Plain and simple, without Lisbeth Salander, this book would be on the bottom shelf next to the $.99 value DVD bin at Wal-Mart.  The writing is sloppy, sensationalist and the story largely predictable.  Even Lisbeth Salander, an abused badass hacker, bike riding, 88 pound ass-kicking badass is the product of massive male fantasy.  One gets the feeling Larsson stole the heroine from Peter Høeg's Smilla's Sense of Snow and then punked her out. The prose too is boring as the English translation lacks any sort of idiom in the language.  I would have to read the original Swedish to know if it digests the same in Larson's native language.  The other two books are largely weaker, slower and lack the social framework this one does.<br /><br />There is a solid topic at work here as phrased in the actual title of \\"Men hate Women,\\" but this isn't that deep.  Salander is an amazing main character, but the story too is forgettable.  I would say the movie adaptation is surprisingly much more entertaining.  If you've never read a mystery before, this should just blow you away.  But if you've been through Agatha Christie's library, it's weaksauce.
0061537969|5.0|If you've ever lost a dog, or hurt from the pain of thier loss, this book is for you. It's a quick read and gives you a good feeling after you have finished reading it, it may not bring your compainion back, however it will set your mind at ease. I loved it and i'm buying two additional copies for friends.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was the most moving story I have ever read and the point of view by Death was the most intresting thing about it. The charcters grew on me from the very first page. This book should get more than a five.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|I have to admit, I was a bit apprehensive about getting this album. How do you follow up something as wonderful as \\"Phantom\\"? This one is definitely MUCH darker, and not nearly as romantic. And some of the changes to the characters really bother me. But I found several tumes coming back to haunt me, time and again. Once again, the Phantom has the best songs (as he should!), and the actor in the role has by far and away the strongest voice in the cast - aslo appropriately. I far prefer the Phantom's song, \\"Til I Hear You Sing\\" to the title tune. So while \\"Love Never Dies\\" is a bit of a disappointment story-wise, it is NOT disappointing in its music.
B00003W8NM|4.0|The description says its this version was released in 2000 but the one I got was released in 2003. The 2003 doesnt have a booklet that the 2000 version has and it is Glossy istead of flat. Other than that it was in great condition and it shipped fast.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|This movie (in my opinion) has a better story than the new one (Tron Legacy).  This movie has such an intriguing, and fun story that keeps you watching and devoted to the story.  The graphics were not near as good as the new movie, but were very creative for the time when this movie came out.  The movie is beautiful in HD, and looks great on Blu Ray.  I greatly enjoyed this movie, and loved the story.  If you are fan of the new one, or saw the original on VHS or in theatre, you definetly need to get this and check out the glorious HD.  I highly recommend watching both of them and getting pulled into the intriguing story and beautiful graphics.  Highly Recommend!!!
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Quick rundown:    --Lots of swearing.  --Semi-gory gunfights with human and alien weaponry. There is only one really detailed gory scene, but it's fast and the human character deserves it.  --Humans explode like water balloons. Awesome!    -- Excellent special effects that complement the movie and plot but don't overshadow it. You will begin to get used to the aliens as if they and the world you are watching is real as opposed to a film like Avatar where the special effects were the main draw. District 9 strives to make the effects not stand out so they don't distract from the story but make things look very real.    -- A redemption fantasy. This film is about a heel of a human doing the nearly impossible: realize he's an ass and make up for it. That is probably why so many like it, and such a tiny minority dislike it. The self-absorbed and those with short attention spans should avoid this.      -- This is not \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Trek.\\" If your view of sf is limited to those kinds of franchises you likely will not like this film. District 9 is not a cliche or a rip off of eastern archetype story telling or a Costner film. It requires a bit of familiarity with the world, some of the recent history of Africa, organizations like the UN, and the ability to endure criticism and accept that humans are not God's gift to the universe.       -- If you fantasize about social science fiction which shows the human race as it truly is (our history is more than ample evidence), this is the film for you. It may be inspired by South African history, but it well and truly could have been made about the history of any nation. It is not a \\"humans are evil\\" story by any means, just a very accurate depiction of humanity.     -- Watch the director's commentary version first if you really want to understand the film later.
B0034G4OZE|1.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story isn't funny even accidentally!The previews shown in the theater were the only funny parts and then when you see it in the context of the movie it just isn't funny!  The story never really connects all the characters in a meanful way.
0307272702|4.0|First, this is a good book with details and citations supporting the information provided. You should read it.<br /><br />I will say though, that it's quietly inflammatory. He's so nice about saying that everything you know is wrong.<br /><br />The first half of this book was difficult for me to slog through. It was a relatively repetitive look at how the current low-fat perspective on diet came about and what people did (or knew) before that paradigm shift.<br /><br />However, after finishing the book I appreciate the first half being there. It helps drive home the points and the science in the second half of the book. I found my thoughts frequently returning to examples he had given.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this book.

B004NOH9LW|3.0|Short movie, small story line, surprised Matt Damon wasted his acting talent on this script.  This movie is a coulda-shoulda-woulda.
B004PUG7MG|4.0|Avril Lavigne has always seemed to be someone who knows who she is as an artist. Whether she's wondering why everything has to be so complicated, blaming an ex for screwing up her happy ending or taunting a boy about his girlfriend, Avril has somehow managed to stay true to herself; a bratty guitar-playing rock star who just wants to jam out and run around malls across America. Even the bubblegum pop sound that saturated her third album, 'The Best Damn Thing', didn't throw off Avril's attitude, which has remained her greatest asset throughout her career. Somewhere along the way, though, it seems that Avril grew up just a little bit. The once-eternal bratty pop-punk girl got married, then divorced, and now she's posing on the cover of her latest album in a wedding dress on top of a piano somewhere in a dark forest. It's an image that's stunning both in its beauty as well as in the maturity that Lavigne musters, and it is immediately noticeable that things have changed. 'Goodbye Lullaby', four years in the making, is the exact opposite of 'The Best Damn Thing'. In fact, there's as many up-tempo tracks here as there were ballads on that effort, which really works in her favor.    The album begins with a commercial point of view in mind. Once the twinkling 'Black Star' intro finishes, the synthy bubblegum-popping rush of 'What the Hell' kicks in, and it's like the block party of a high school graduation. Then, 'Push' slows the momentum, commercial but not nearly as infectious. Pushing Avril's register, it's a confessional tale of a love on the rocks that may just be salvaged. 'Wish You Were Here', easily the most single-ready ballad, has a hook-laden chorus crafted from the aftermath of a tortured farewell. Then, it's back to the party with 'Smile', a crunchy guitar and synth-heaped single injected with a dazzling amount of fun.    This stop-start-stop of the opening set is a bit jarring upon first listen, but the tempo settles into mid- to slow-tempos by number six, 'Stop Standing There'. It's a bopping number that nicely transitions the mood for the rest of the record, which paints the intimate scene of Avril sitting with her guitar and a few other people in her home studio. It's like nothing she's done before; even on the angsty 'Under My Skin', everything still felt very much aimed at the radio, even if it was coming from Avril's downtrodden heart.    This new sound takes quite a bit of getting used to. The only immediate standout on the second half is 'Not Enough', a pounding confessional of bleak proportions. However, after multiple spins, these songs start to sink in, and Avril's emotions begin to feel true and powerful. The hooks begin to drive home, expertly built around the lyrics rather than the beat. This is strongest on the closing number, 'Goodbye', a beautiful violen-driven song that sums up the entire record perfectly.    While Avril may lose quite a few fans with this effort, especially after 'The Best Damn Thing' won her the tween punk-pop loving crowd, she is nonetheless staying true to her current state of mind. As a jaded young woman with the fresh wounds of divorce weighing heavy upon her heart, Avril shows that at her best, she can give Alanis Morrisette's 'Jagged Little Pill' some tough competition.    Letter Grade: A-    Recommended Tracks: 'What the Hell', 'Smile', 'Not Enough', and 'Goodbye'
B004LRZ2YC|4.0|Just because you're a vampire doesn't mean you a bad person. All the right lessons with examples of the wrong solutions. Typical horror movie with a different twist. Worth watching.
0316056863|5.0|Ms. Fey succeeds at writing something for everyone.  She is often really funny.  She is consistently literate.  Much of her book seems to be candid autobiography...with emphasis on life turning-points.  Notwithstanding lots of good humor, and good (comic) humor, she seems modest and genuine.....and well aware of how hard work may lead to making the best of good fortune.  But how little we can really control good fortune.  I am of a different generation, have enjoyed Saturday Night Live for years, but had never even heard of 30 Rock.  But after reading this book, I feel that Ms. Fey would be fun to know.  I have never before had such a thought about a professional entertainer; I am amazed to have it now.  A worthy read.
B004JVXTL8|5.0|Loved it!!!! Alot of thought and consideration was put into this movie. The connection to part one was perfect script writing. This movie will make the \\"Classics\\" catagory, however part 3 will probly ruin it.

0525422943|5.0|Where She Went is the sequel to Gayle Forman's If I Stay that was very popular. The story picks up three years after Mia leaves for Julliard in NYC leaving behind Adam, her boyfriend who stood beside her after the car crash that ended the lives of her parents and younger brother, and also willed her into staying alive.  As Mia creates a new life for herself in NY, Adam is devastated at the breakup and writes a rock album for his band that ends up going double platinum. Adam is thrown into the rock-star lifestyle and is unable enjoy anything that is happening to him.  While preparing to leave on tour and on the verge of breaking down and losing complete control of his life a chance meeting at Carnegie Hall allows Mia and Adam to finally put closure on their relationship and to the words spoken ages ago while Mia was in a coma back in Oregon.<br /><br />The majority of the novel is a painful break-up scene that flashes forward and back between the love that the young couple shared and the present words that must be spoken to free themselves from the trauma that they continue to live and walk around with. The ending is surprisingly cathartic and refreshing. The music element that is woven throughout the novel continues to be such a strong aspect of the story, connecting people and places together and in a juxtapositioning way making it deep, creative, and interesting. The ending rewards the reader for the utter depression that you sink into during the journey throughout the entire book. These two books are a great read, easily accomplished in a day or two. I do hope these are made into movies.
1439102724|4.0|I really enjoy reading Jodi Picoult's books. I bought this book right before we went on a cruise and I finished it a week after we came home. Her stories always have a surprise twist at the end as did \\"Sing You Home\\". This book came with a cd of songs to go with the chapters. I did not listen to the cd yet. I did lend this book to my sister who is a fan also!
B004V71CT6|5.0|The Stargate shows are one of my favorites in the Sci-Fi category.  I have seen all of them.  From SG-1 to Atlantis to Universe.  They get better and better.  I don't even like Sci-Fi that much.  I'm a history buff.  I like to watch things that teach me something.  Thats why i like this show.  Yes it is Science Fiction, not Fact, But it has alot of Truth and real theory to it.  I would sudgest stargate to anyone.  I started with Atlantis, but it's best to start at the begining with SG-1.  You won't regret this buy!

B000NDIAWY|5.0|I'm an old guy with eclectic tastes.  I still like Grace Slick, Joan Baez, Linda Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell, Sarah Machlachan, and Norah Jones.  And I need to add Brandi to that list.  She does things vocally that I would be inclined to say \\"You can't do that\\", but she does them.  Just when I think her voice has to break, she pulls it off, and I am amazed.  As a song-writer she is middle-of-the-range (which isn't bad for my tastes) but as a vocalist she is outstanding.  I recommend all of her albums.  Brandi could use a producer and a band that are equal to her talent.
0345472322|2.0|The main message is excellent. The fact that a growth mindset can offer more benefits when compared to the fixed mindset is great to know and to apply.<br /><br />BUT BUT BUT....<br /><br />This book has overall a very weak argumentation and very shallow reasoning to get the message across. This book is clearly written for a bigger public but if her research has the same thinking errors I am wondering if I am reading the right book.<br /><br />The author uses \\"argumentation by examples\\". Tons of examples are actually given to get the point across. Sadly the same logic can be used to give counter arguments for each example given. Just providing many examples is not a valid way to make a strong case, especially as the author selects examples that fits best her own theory. You can prove almost anything with that type of logic, but along as the book sells I guess...<br /><br />Some examples of the weak argumentations used:<br /><br />Tiger Woods gets classified under the growth mindset and therefore he is \\"gooood\\" and we only read on the success stories of Tiger Woods. As the book was released in 2006 we know by now that Tiger Woods had during his success years also a different aspect of his personality ongoing. This detail was illustrated in the years after, resulting in a messy divorce. Oops the growth-mindset theory for Tiger Woods might be not that excellent fit anymore.<br /><br />John McEnroe on the other hand gets classified under the fixed mindset and therefore he is \\"baaaaad\\". The author gives many examples explaining his fixed mindset attitude but she forgets to mention that John McEnroe might have been juiced up with steroids at the time (Ref McEnroe's own statements). And yes these steroids made him act with more \\"character\\" during competition. Oops there goes the fixed mindset theory for John McEnroe also.<br /><br />Sadly this sort of examples-argumentation goes on and on.<br /><br />Perhaps the best case is illustrated on page 174 (paperback edition - 2008). The author writes \\"Parents and teachers who send fixed-mindset messages are like France, and parents and teachers who send growth-mindset messages are like Italy\\". The author got this insight while eating in a restaurant in Italy. I quote \\"When we got there and found a little family restaurant, tears started streaming down my face. I felt so nurtured. I said to David, 'You know, in France, when they're nice to you, you feel like you've passed a test. But in Italy, there is no test'\\". Based the information collected during a dinner in a restaurant and a short stay in France, it is clear for the author that France (yes the whole nation) has a fixed mindset and that Italy (yep again that whole country again) has a growth mindset. How more shallow can you go? And nope this was not given as an illustration.<br /><br />Look if you write first that the growth-mindset makes you step away from judging and biased fixed opinions I suggest the author takes her own medicine. Judging a whole nation and labeling it with \\"growth or fixed mindset\\" is a very poor reasoning skill. And I am not even French!<br /><br />The same style of examples and argumentation are given for relationships, business, sport, parents, teachers...The growth mindset gets used here as THE golden standard such it can explain all which is a pity. If we have to extrapolate the same reasoning skills shown here to the actually research for this book we should be very worried.<br /><br />So is it worthwhile to read this book?...NO<br /><br />Is it worthwhile to know about the main idea?....yes very. But there are faster ways to get to the idea without reading this book.<br /><br />Contents<br />1 The mindsets<br />2 Inside the mindsets<br />3 The truth about ability and accomplishment<br />4 Sport: The mindset of a champion<br />5 Business: Mindset and Leadership<br />6 Relationships: Mindsets in love (or not)<br />7 Parents, teachers, and coaches: Where do mindsets come from?<br />8 Changing mindsets8).

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I bought two of these! I just couldn't bare to share it with anyone! I gave one to my sister, she loves this movie as much as I do! Now I can watch it whenever I feel like it-and it's been alot of times already! Love this movie!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|If you're in the States, you're probably here because you saw the PBS broadcast of \\"Les Miserables 25th Concert.\\" If you've been lucky enough to see one of the stage productions over the years, you don't need to be sold on \\"Les Mis.\\" It's the world's longest running musical because of the power of its story and the grace of its music and lyrics.     But if the PBS Pledge-a-thon was your first introduction to the musical (or the book it's based on) and you're like me and usually read the reviews, you might be confused by the heat about whether the 10th or the 25th concert is better, and debate about which actor/singer shines in which role. You can safely ignore all this. Both concerts stand on their own merits. While the original cast has a right to be proud of how they shaped Les Mis, no show should be caught in amber. The 25th Concert has been almost completely recast, with a new, fuller orchestration, a different take on presenting the musical \\"in concert,\\" and 21st century light, sound and SFX.     And you're here because of Alfie Boe. The lead in \\"Les Mis\\" has never been sung by a classically trained, operatic tenor before, and it's easy to forget what a gamble Cameron Mackintosh took in casting Alfie. Despite having sung in European opera houses, starring in Baz Lurhmann's staged \\"La Boheme,\\" and the English National Opera's \\"Kismet,\\" he'd never crossed over into musical theater. And though he'd had a short run doing the stage version, Alfie was a complete cipher to most of the audience. \\"Les Mis\\" fans can be very partisan and very vocal. But by the end of Alfie's first numbers, Valjean's Soliloquy/What Have I Done, the audience roars its surprise and approval. His fresh appreciation of Jean Valjean and the power and grace of his voice is heart-stopping. (After \\"Bring Him Home\\" Alfie received over a four minute standing ovation, cut down to a minute on the dvd. I think the audience was applauding not just that stunningly beautiful song, but everything that hadgone before, too. He deserved every second of it.)     So, yes, get the dvd or blu-ray. There aren't any extras, no \\"making of\\". But then, the concert itself, and the wonderful encores with the 1985 cast, and current Queen's and West End casts are more than enough. But if you would like a making of, \\"Les Mis: Matt Lucas Dreams the Dream\\" in four parts on youtube should fill the bill nicely.     And if you fall in love with the story, do yourself a favor and pick up the unabridged novel by Victor Hugo. Yeah, it's 1400pgs long, and Hugo famously goes off into wild, lengthy digressions on the Battle of Waterloo, orders of nuns, and others, but you can always skip over these if you like. The musical follows the book fairly closely, but a lot has to be passed over. Unfortunately, the Hollywood movie versions play fast and loose with the plot, and usually end before Valjean's death. Be warned.     So, welcome to \\"Les Miserables,\\"one of the classics of Western literature. Proving that some stories are indeed, timeless.
B004NOH9LW|4.0|It has been some time since I just sat and relaxed and let a movie just wash over me.This is a hard subject to project on screen. We are all searching for the answer to this topic in many ways and forms. This movie made it easy to think about the various answers people come up with.I liked the melding of the story line with age old question what happens after we die. The acting was good and the characters were well developed.The pace was slow and easy.

The writing and sets cannot be matched.  Thanks to rapid-fire dialog and unbeatable acting by THE PERFECT actors for each role, the plot/plots race ahead, and before you know it, that record player is in front of you and it's over for another episode, your face hurts from laughing so hard, and you're thinking about a line(s) of dialog that especially cracked you up.  Thank you, Amazon, for an excellent DVD!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|If you have a Wii and still want to play your Gamecube games, This controller is the best thing you can have. Its extra long cord helps to ensure you can play from anywhere without the worry of pulling your system off a shelf. The best part is, its an official Nintendo product, so you know you will have that brand name quality
B004NSULHM|5.0|if you don't enjoy this release, then you missed the integrity of radioheads work.  this album is no different in radioheads previous releases except it focuses on what radiohead are really good at: presenting tense moods in a relaxed, meditative manner.  King of Limbs flows better than any previous radiohead released.  each track seems like a logical progression from the next....the album starts tense and axious and gradually calms down in mood till it becomes almost dream like in delivery.  true radiohead fans who appreciate their more insightful work will be pleased with the output.   everyone else,  sorry you can't appreciate this beautiful work at art.
0316044695|5.0|This book was unbelievably good.  I could not stop reading once I began and ended up reading the entire book in one sitting.  I am an avid reader but it takes a lot to capture and hold my attention.  I really enjoy true documentaries as well as other true accounts of events in history. This book was gripping and perhaps due to my job I especially enjoyed the read.  I missed a grand opportunity to meet Marcus Luttrel due to timelines, however I hope the opportunity will arise again one day.

B004L49K20|3.0|i think like other 80 new wave artists like Sade and Bryan Ferry, DD is in a little bit of a catch 22, if they redo old material, it's stale and if they reinvent themselves too much, it's not them, and although there have been exceptions like Bryan Ferry's \\"Baby Blue\\" and Sade's \\"Soldier of Love\\" as well as Duran Duran's \\"Ordinary World,\\" the memorable releases they've done lately are few and far between. Similarly, \\"All you need is now\\" features a great track inaptly named \\"crossburning\\" with an opening drum solo by Roger Taylor rivaling \\"Girls on Film.\\" The slower tracks, however, are so slow, i thought they would never start and then that they would never end. We've come a long way from Sting's wailing \\"Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light\\" to Simon's wailing \\"if you leave a light on for me (I'll come).\\" All in all, maybe their best since Rio but I thought they would be gone after \\"Reflex\\" (1984) and they're still here, so that says a lot, uptempo suits them better than ballads.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|If I knew a person anywhere near as freaky and sick as the actress Natalie Portman displays in this wreck of a movie, I would steer as clear as I could from them, as I have on many occasions in the past while living in NYC.  I guess this \\"sicko\\" mentality is par for the course for New York.  This woman shouldn't be dancing, she should be in a psychiatric ward - full stop! We will look back on this over-pretentious attempt to be artistically \\"inclined\\" in a decade and think \\"what was that all about?\\"  Sort of like \\"American Beauty\\".
B003YOZNBU|2.0|Well I went into this movie not knowing anything about the comic book character of Jonah Hex.  In fact I had no idea it even *was* a comic book character.  The description for the movie sounded appealing to me, so I made the horrendous decision to watch it assuming I was going to be impresed by an action flick but.. wow does it ever seriously unquestionably STINK!    Good luck trying to follow along to any kind of storyline.  The pacing of the film mainly focuses around cheesy explosions coming out of nowhere, a woman who works as a prostitute and her daily struggles dealing with men who want to kill her, and people lying dead in the ground coming back to life for a few minutes to reveal important information before quickly slipping back into death again.  I really don't get any of this of course.      Just keep in mind that you probably need to understand the comic book character of Jonah Hex in order to grasp the storyline.  Otherwise you'll be left sitting there totally confused and uninterested in just about everything taking place on screen.    Even without understanding any of the storyline segments, it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to realize the acting is terrible all around.  I'm disappointed because the description said absolutely *nothing* about this movie being based on a comic book because if it had, I surely wouldn't have bothered watching it.
B0040HO16S|1.0|I've just discovered Lark Rise to Candleford and have fallen in love with it, but my review is, specifically, for the instant TV version of the show.  I'm watching the first episode again, after having watched it on YouTube on my phone, and I've discovered at least two parts of the first episode that have been cut out.  While they don't necessarily pertain to the story, I'm frustrated that I spent money on an incomplete television show and am wondering why Amazon would offer edited versions.
B000002UWP|5.0|When this cassette came out I was working at Western Sizzlin on the buffet bar.  I usually kept the fried foods and soups filled up.  I was so addicted to this cassette that I put the chicken livers, okra, hushpuppies, etc down in the oil, set my timer and run out the back door to the car to listen to a song.  I came in and then took the food to the bar and if I had some more free time, I ran back out to the car.  It sounded real good on my new Sony 6\\"x9\\" speakers and Kenwood stereo.  :)  When I bought a CD player I had to purchase all my Roxette cassettes on CD.

If you read this book you will be inspired to reach for enchantment in your own busienss.  And that's a good thing.<br /><br />Not your typical business book filled with theory.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|It was Top Notch!  I was so impressed I sent one as a surprise gift to a like minded friend.    The whole story was \\"not to cold and not to hot\\"  It was just right and my husband and I enjoyed the whole thing!
0316069353|1.0|I love Michael Connelly, I love every book he has ever written with the exception of Chasing the Dime. This one star review is a comment on his publishers disastrous decision to price the Kindle version higher than the paper copy at discount book stores. Had the Kindle edition been $9.99 I would have purchased it, my sister would have purchased it, and my brother would have purchased it. Because the publisher got greedy now one of us will buy the physical copy and share it when we are done. thus losing the publisher money due to their greed. I hate that this is coming back to bite Mr. Connelly, but a digital copy being more expensive that the printed paper version is simply untenable, and this is the only way fans have of expressing their outrage.
0756404738|5.0|This book (and its predecessor \\"The Name of the Wind\\") is very good. I'm not a big reader of fiction, and certainly not of fantasy, but this series is irresistibly intelligent and captivating. I strongly recommend reading it.
B001886LQU|5.0|Very good movie. A different point of view for filming which made this movie special. Not your typical happy ending and I loved the deleted scenes. I like the special steel box.
B00004XPPE|4.0|No matter how many times I watch this movie, it gives me a shiver.  Yes, the movie is dated, but the acting sure makes up for that little problem.  The only form of media that can stay current, after all, is TV.  Where are the next Walter Matthau and Henry Fonda?  I would reccommend this movie to anyone who has a curiosity about living in the Sixties.
B004MOMT2M|4.0|Obviously, there's nothing bad to say about \\"Moving Pictures\\" the album.  This doesn't appear to have been remastered again since the '97 one.  The regular CD sounds the same to me.  As far as the surround mix, I came on here looking to see if others were as disappointed as I was, & apart from one other person, everybody else seems o.k. with it.  I had no problem at all w/ the 5.1 mix of \\"Snakes & Arrows\\"; thought it sounded great in fact.  My complaint about it on this release is that there's very limited use of the surround effects.  \\"The Camera Eye\\" & \\"Vital Sounds\\" use them to greatest effect, but the main problem with the mix?  Where's the big fat sounding bass?!?  I checked everything on my system to make sure something hadn't gone out because Geddy is relegated to mostly midrange & I fail to see how anyone could do such a thing to someone who has such a great sound!  I think they should get Steven Wilson to redo this or whoever did Queen's \\"A Night At The Opera.\\"  I definitely think Rush should sound better than this, particularly on arguably their best record.

0312600844|4.0|I was thinking some more about \\"Freedom\\" over the last few days.  Not everyone my book club liked it, but I did.  Although we talked about how the book in many ways highlights the common tendency for people to not be happy with what they have right now and to yearn for what is out-of-reach, this line of thinking shows the book to be rather dark, and I don't think that was its only theme or message, (if there IS a message).  I liked the book, and I've decided that you can flip that message and extract a corollary idea.  In an inverse way, I think the book is also showing us that: \\"Happiness is not getting what you want, but WANTING WHAT YOU GET.\\"  That aphorism explains the book to me very clearly.  All you familiar with that saying?  Think about the characters in the book who WERE happy.  Connie, Carole's daughter, although not our favorite character, was able to be HAPPY in her love for her not-so-true-blue boyfriend Josh, even when he sets forth that ludicrous exercise for them, as a love test, that they should try to not communicate when he was away at college.  We know he was trying to free himself from Connie to explore new relationships, and maybe didn't like him for that, but Connie was able to work it all through psychologically and create contentment for herself within the strictures of the love test.  She was able to find happiness by being able to want what she got during that time.  This completely baffled Josh, remember?  Also, throughout most of the story, Walter was a happy character, maybe kind of \\"milquetoasty,\\" but happy anyway, because he \\"wanted what he got,\\" which was Patty.  It was only when Walter wasn't at peace with what he got, for example when he began to be pained about Lalitha's firm decision to not have children, did he become unhappy.  Patty could not be happy, even when she \\"got\\" Richard Katz, her lifelong out-of-reach mythical lover.  So, for me, the book was all about, \\"Happiness is not getting what you want, but wanting what you get.\\" Just had to share my new little insight.
1848312202|3.0|Cordelia Fine has written a book that is the missing link in the equality debate. It tends to be technical and sometimes difficult to follow for the non academic person such as myself. But it is an important read for any one wanting to know the reasonable truth about the differences between the sexes. If you are a parent it is a must read.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|When it has came down to really good albums, there just have been fewer and far between than the past few years, especially in R&B music. With the severe overexposure of dance pop music from Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Britney Spears lately, there just has been a lack of diversity from artists whom really do have the natural talent, and not watered down. For Jennifer Hudson, she has been put under that pressure point in 2 ways. Not just with a sophmore effort, but finding her voice again in music, after her her tragic family losses from her mother and nephew losing their lifes. Thankfully, she has risen above those ashes and found her strength again, and hasn't lost the luster. But for her follow-up is it worth the effort? Well mostly yes, but in the feeling of trying a take from one of her idols recent records.<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson's I Remember Me isn't a bad follow-up record to her debut album. The songs bring in a nice blend of upbeat and uplifting songs, with the sad baggage of a few slip-ups. Surprisingly the songs and feeling of I Remember Me takes on a familiar feeling of soul similar to her idol, Whitney Houston and her beautiful 2009 album I Look To You. That honestly is in more ways than one not just in her feeling on I Remember Me, but with the same team of writers from R. Kelly on her lead single, Where You At, to the elequent writing of Diane Warren on Still Here, to working with Alicia Keys & her husband Swiss Beatz on Everybody Needs Love, which brings in a nice 70's style rhythm, to the gospel influenced Believe. The songs all are mostly Jennifer's own well, and show that she is honestly one of the few whom has stepped away from the lingered stigma from the American Idol phase that has been a drag on other A.I. alumni like Jordin Sparks and Kelly Clarkson in their music the past few years, with weak albums and lack of heart.<br /><br />All in all to me, Jennifer Hudson's I Remember Me is a pretty good album. While it isn't like what her idol Whitney Houston had showcased with I Look To You, as a beautiful and intimately modern soul record from start to finish, Jennifer Hudson still holds her own well. A big voice, with a feeling for real music. There are very few really good albums that have came out the past few years that have been worth their money, especially in R&B. I really do recommend Jennifer's sophmore album I Remember Me. She is showing that the sophmore curse isn't there at all, and honestly I do hope that Jennifer keeps the music up well. Unlike wannabe acts like Lady Gaga and Rihanna, Jennifer has shown she is her own woman, and a real singer without the limitations that others have made.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Mastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+wcased with I Look To You, as a beautiful and intimately modern soul record from start to finish, Jennifer Hudson still holds her own well.

B003L77GHE|5.0|Yep, that's exactly what I thought when I heard of this show. I thought it was yet another mass-consumer product for all those rabid Tween-Twilight fans (and their mom's)...<br />Until I actually sat down and watched it.<br />VD, (funny acronyms aside) I am happy to admit, was everything that Twilight dribble was not: it treated teens seriously, (as Buffy the Vampire Slayer did) realistically and was not afraid to explore controversial subjects. This show does not depict teens as vapid, angsty and shallow, (although some of the characters do start that way). It takes the vampire genre, (Dracula, Anne Rice, True Blood) and the teen TV show genre (90210, Dawson's Creek, Party of Five) and gives it a fresh and supernatural spin. Its refreshing to see a show where the characters have real-life motivations, actually portraying the glories and perils of adolescence. It does not shy away from topics such as drug use, unprotected sex, racism and promiscuity. It blends adolescent and adult characters with great care and realism. It is nice to actually watch a show that makes me want to come back for more, that actually cares about the subject and the viewer. Major characters struggle, suffer and actually die; this is not a soap opera. Bravo for Vampire Diaries! Cannot wait for season 3. I just hope they keep these writers happy and that the formula continues. For those of you who are reluctant to watch, trust me, I was too and now I am a big fan of this show.
B001RTP3YQ|4.0|This CD is awesome!  Only issue with the \\"Live\\" version is that sometimes the music and/or the background vocals are so loud you can't hear Leonard sing.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I had heard one cut (The Cave) on alternative radio, and took the risk of ordering the CD.  I was pleasantly surprised by the remaining songs.  I enjoy music from the British Isles as well as acoustic and alternative rock, and this CD fits those interests.  My college and high school sons also approve (a difficult endorsement to obtain).  After two months, it's still the most played in my collection.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Looks like it would be fun, but every time I try to open the game, I get a \\"Force Closed\\" message.  I wrote to the company that created it, but never got an answer.
B000VWOV3O|4.0|Im not so worried about the packaging, you can put the cds in a plastic case if you want, and any search on the net can tell you about the records themselves. I was only somewhat familiar with MO. These are the first records ive owned by them. Fantastic. Thats all i have to say. I love McLaughlin's work with Davis, which is what lead me to explore more of his music. Jack Johnson is probably my fav Davis record so, of course, most of this MO stuff went over great with me. The drumming on these records is just insane and i love the way it was recorded. This is a great package for those who want to hear the music and dont need a complete band history on a little insert. Look online like i did, while listening to these great records.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|First off, I don't watch much TV and we don't even have cable television in our house, just cable internet. I never heard of this series until it was offered through the Amazon Vine program. Out of curiosity I ordered it, thinking I'd watch the first episode or two and formulate a review.     Well good thing there are only 8 episodes because otherwise I'd have spent a lot more time watching this instead of doing whatever I should have been doing. Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop because I had to see what was going to happen next.     You can get the basic plot details from the other reviews posted here. What I want to say is that I got addicted because of the quality of the plots and the acting - I became immersed in the series and felt like someone who was actually there with this small band of survivors, feeling constantly on edge because of the dangers to which they were exposed and also imagining a world in which something like this actually happened.     One thing I want to point out is that it is a very gruesome show - most definitely the scenes of violence and bloodshed are graphic and disturbingly real so if that kind of stuff bothers you, then I'd suggest watching something else. It's a virtual hackfest of blood spraying all over the place and body parts flying in all directions. This is not solely for shock value, though - it is just part of the overall experience of watching this series, and part of what I feel are very intelligently written and believably acted plots.     While I am not planning on getting cable television just to watch season 2, I am looking forward to the new season so that they can hurry up and release it on DVD.  I give it thumbs way, way up.
0143039881|5.0|For Hannah Arendt, Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem was deeply unsatisfying and morally perturbing.  For Arendt, there was no doubt that Eichmann was guilty, and that he deserved the death penalty.  But for her the question was who ought to have been on trial, and who ought to have been the judge and jury.      For Israeli prosecutors to condemn Eichmann as the chief architect of the Holocaust and to condemn him to death for orchestrating the mass slaughter of Jews was for Arendt to completely miss the point.  Eichmann was just a mere functionary in the Nazi regime, a man who in his own words was just good at following orders, and whose virtues were his organizational ability (he was in charge of transporting Jews) and his obedience.  As anyone who saw Eichmann in the flesh could testify, he was more a weak and pathetic and stupid man than he was a psychopath.  He was obsessed with success, and thought highly of Hitler because Hitler had gone from a lance corporal to the fuhrer.  In many ways, Eichmann was more indicative of the Nazi regime than anyone else.  Even the SS ferreted out psychopaths as dangerous elements, and the Nazi regime prided itself on its organizational efficiency in carrying out orders.  In this way, and the real horror here, the Nazi regime was typical of many twentieth century mass society bureaucracies.  And in their bureaucratic tunnel vision, the Nazis were not intent on just eliminating all Jews -- they wanted to eliminate everyone who didn't fit their limited definition of Aryanism.  In this way, the Nazis were committing a crime against all humanity, destroying all that was normal and sane and just in society.  (Eichmann as a man who obeyed and thus supported a regime that was intent on murderously practicing its intolerance couldn't complain when society deemed his presence on the earth no longer tolerable.)  But if that is the case then Eichmann should have been tried for crimes against humanity, and condemned to death by an international tribunal.     Eichmann claimed that obedience was a virtue, but as Arendt points out if the law and the state are both criminal, then the only virtue is disobedience.  And if enough good people disobey the law and the state cannot operate.  She points to countless examples, primarily in the Scandavinian countries, where by refusing to participate many individuals made the Holocaust impossible to implement in their home countries.  Eichmann may not have killed anyone, but his obedience was enough to condemn him because it was the obedience of banal individuals like him that made the Nazi regime function.       \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem\\" is a prophecy, more than just a report.  More than anyone else in her time, Hannah Arendt grasped the dark forces that a combination of bureaucratism, technology, and ancient human intolerance could unleash in the world.  What is to stop another bureaucracy from using technology to effortlessly and painlessly murder all those under a certain IQ?, Hannah Arendt asks.  And when that were to happen, how would we interpret and condemn such an action?  Could the Eichmann trial serve as a precedent and as a warning?  Unfortunately, because of the way it was handled or mishandled, it cannot.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|The past few books from Connelly haven't been all that good.  Frankly, DRAGONS was something of a mess.  THE REVERSAL stretched credibility to the breaking point.<br /><br />In THE FIFTH WITNESS, the writer comes back strong with a straightforward story.  Mickey Haller has fallen on lean times and is living as a pilot fish on the belly of the mortgage foreclosure business.  When a client is accused of killing her loan officer, Haller is back in the criminal defense game.<br /><br />It's a simple tale, but it's one that allows Haller to shine.  His ambiguous morality and towering intellect make Haller a thoroughly modern hero.<br /><br />I'll definitely be first in line to buy the next one.
B004HWR406|1.0|Oh boy, was this a boring movie. In order to make it not boring, they tried to show a lot of semi-naked women. But, it didn't work. So, if you like boring movies that disrespect women, then this is the movie for you.
B003UESJHO|3.0|well to be frank with you can't see it as an Oscar winner and would never compete with any Stallone film. not sure if it rates an OK. Probably not what anyone wants to hear.
B004GYY714|5.0|WOW! AMAZING! LOVE IT!!  There was a station I wanted to hear in my area, however, had a hard time getting a signal to it.  I recently bought a COBY 7015 PC Tablet and saw this FREE app available.     Needless to say, it has turned my PC Tablet into a glorified radio!  I live in RI and radio around here is just filled with garbage talk radio and other current musical junk.  I was also looking to pull in some christian rock stations.  Well, this app pulls in GREAT radio stations from all around the globe and internet stations!  This app would be great for someone who has moved and misses their favorite radio station--You can get it here!  You can search for it by their broadcast letters!  You can also get AWESOME stations from a site called AUDIOCREAM--they have stations that just play songs for a particular year--for example--f you wanna listen to songs just from your high school senior year, just type in something like \\"1984 hits\\" and you can get the station!      If you wanna find a station that is currently playing a song by a certain artist, just type in the name of the artist, and this app will find you stations that are playing their songs!  Wanna just listen to 80's hairbands--just type in that search and you get tons of stations that just play that genre of music.  Another great thing about TUNEIN is there are MANY noncommercial stations..I sooo can't stand when a DJ is talking right up to when the vocalist begins to sing on a song (92 Pro FM is THE WORST for this!).  It also has a save presets function, for when you like a station, you can save it to this feature!     Like I said, I used to love listening to the radio, by the area that I live in doesn't have anything that great listen to (except for 1 station: 95.5 wbru--but I don't always wanna listen to alternative rock)--with TUNEIN, and the HUGE variety it offers, you will NEVER be able to say \\"there's nothing good on the radio\\" again!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|Will not buy this book. Come on people, do not tell me you are willing to turn people away from your work (does not matter if author, publisher, Amazon, etc.).  What is the price to NOT print, bind, ship, stock, etc?  Not asking to have it for free, but reasonable would be nice.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This album is a keeper!  Outstanding performances of goosebump variety, buy it and listen over and over...you won't regret it.
B004INNRFK|4.0|David Foster is truly a talented person.  I admire anyone who is involved with music, whether writing, composing, singing, or producing.  This second production is so wonderful.  If you are a baby boomer, like me, this CD/DVD combination will bring back alot of memories. I have watched the DVD over, and over, and over. I am so impressed with the guests.  Seal, All for One, Michael Bolton, Martina McBride, Charisse, and Earth, Wind, and Fire. I will always be a devoted fan to that band!  One very disappointing fact about the CD is that alot of music from the concert was not included.  How could anyone not include \\"Secrets\\" by Seal???  I take my favorite CDs in the car whenever I am driving. I want to hear all of the music from the concert, not just a hand picked selection.  That is the reason that I assigned 4 stars instead of 5.
0525422943|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I will say, this book was an amazing sequel.  The first book tore my heart and I didn't think that it could happen again.  This book had me in pieces!!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.  It felt so real and full of emotion.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|After watching the 25th Anniversary rendition of Les Miserables on PBS, I went to my computer and ordered it on Amazon.  Received it within 2 days and have been blissfully happy!  Thanks!
0316069353|5.0|I had all but given up on Michael Connelly. I've read almost all his stuff, and was a big fan of his early work, but some of his recent Bosch efforts left me cold (could Harry PLEASE use a contraction or two, just maybe once in a blue moon?). However, I thoroughly enjoyed The Fifth Witness. The courtroom strategizing seemed smart and well informed, and the characters were fleshed out and believable - even Haller's despicable client. Feels like Connelly's got his mojo back.
1599218011|5.0|Kris Carr is my new hero!  There's no simpler way to state it.  She writes with intelligence, wit, HUMOR, sincerity, compassion and LOTS of passion!  Not only has this book positively influenced my knowledge and understanding of foods, taking in the information and using it has improved my health!  You will surely be blessed by this book if you are willing to take a new journey for health!
B001WCN23W|4.0|Great album.  I had the vinyl (until recently), but I love the luxury of being able to omit tracks and/or change the play order (I like to play my favourites last).<br /><br />The only track I've never liked on this album is Dead Flowers - I find the music of that track just too straight for ca. 1970. The lyrics are quite amusing. Is it about Suzie Quatro? (She was not famous then, but she was known.)<br /><br />Moonlight Mile and Sway are my favourites (lyrics & music), and Bitch has an undeservedly bad reputation.  It's not about some woman, it's about Love - Love's a Bitch: \\"Yeh you! gotta mix it chile', you gotta mix it / It must be love, it's a bitch\\".  So many radio stations won't play it (scared of some imaginary feminist backlash?) but they play Brown Sugar which has some lyrics suggesting a sadistic-slave fantasy!  Ah, to paraphrase Graham Nash: \\"Political Correctness / Is killing my Country...\\"<br /><br />Great album, sounds even better than my 1970s-bought vinyl (yes, I bought it when it was first released).
B00005LK95|5.0|The DVD came in less time than expected as was of perfect quality. I have been looking for this movie for years and this was my first time on Amazon. I was nervous as first about internet shopping, but the team at Amazon and the seller of this item were very helpful and i felt fine about internet shopping. It was great to realise i now own this movie that i have wanted for so long. Thanks Guys!
B00006EXCC|5.0|Well done! to whoever mastered this onto CD.  Just like the original vinyl (which I owned until recently), which I bought 2nd-hand in the early 1970s.<br /><br />The booklet could've had recording-sessions info instead of the prose piece, but eh! you can't have everything. (And I've got that info from a wonderful old Stones sheet music book.)<br /><br />Even though these songs weren't cutting edge in 1966 (though about a third were recorded in December 1965), like Revolver or Fresh Cream or The Yardbirds recordings of that time, they have a wonderful charm and originality and catchy-ness.<br /><br />I'm always happy when an old favourite vinyl is faithfully reproduced onto CD.  (Wish other artists wouldn't mess with their original mixes.)
B000294SFW|3.0|This album has 4 really good songs and the other songs are bad. The good songs are (Terminal show - Killers - In the name of tragedy - Whorehouse blues). If you are a huge fan then buy this album for this really good tracks . The other tracks are simply bad.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Someone in Stones' marketing gave us great value in the 1990s: Exile On Main Street on one disc.  Great sound quality.  (I had the original vinyl album right up to when I bought the CD.)  I presume this package has the same faithful reproduction of this last great Stones album.<br /><br />There's not many songs from any time that actually compel me to dance, but a few on this album do; especially Rip This Joint (can't sit still).<br /><br />Another Classic on this album is the tribute to Angela Davis - \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" - which reportedly helped greatly to free her.<br /><br />Soul Survivor sends chills down my spine, as does Keef's \\"Happy\\" - one of the greatest love songs ever.<br /><br />Some of the lyrics on this album are quite Christian - check out All Down The Line (\\"I need a sanctified girl with a sanctified mind to help me out right now\\"), and even Ventilator Blues (\\"Everybody's steppin' on their Creator\\"), as well as the obvious Just Wanna See His Face.  But I think the Stones always had Soul.<br /><br />A great album, their last great album in my opinion, but then, many of my favourite 60s bands started losing their Muse in the early 1970s. What was it? Did the Earth go through some kind of 'magic dust' in space during that time?  Ah, Those Were The Days (two songs with that title, both from 1968, do you know which artists?), yes they were.
B0002KPIQY|4.0|I have seen this move before but it has been a long time so when i saw it on Amazon I decided to purchase it.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Even better than the original vinyl (in my opinion), which I bought in the early 1970s.<br /><br />Great songs.  A mostly more mellow Stones album is this one.  Gimme Shelter & Monkey Man are my favourites.  Both still send a chill down my spine, especially when Mary Clayton belts out: \\"Rape! Murder! It's just a shot away...\\" (the unpublicised side of all wars); and then when Mick mellows it with: \\"I said love, sister, it's just a kiss away...\\" - Beautiful.<br /><br />Also good to hear the studio versions of those live Get Yer Ya-Yas Out songs (Love In Vain; Live With Me; Midnight Rambler).<br /><br />Another must-have Stones album, from when they had variety in their music - the Wonderful Decade: 1963-1973.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The story is simply an obscenity,, a comprehensive look at unlimited greed, elitism, criminal negligence in the matter of government oversight, and the final collapse of morals by the so-called elite leaders in our society, and particularly in the financial service industry. To see high officials of investment banking firms stumbling and stammering as govt. committee members ask them simple yes or no questions is disgusting. This Wall Street-caused  financial implosion that has rocked the world economy is all an intelligent person needs to know regarding entrusting his money to these scurrilous bastards. This financial Tsunami shows the total corruption of Wall Street, Academia, and the legal and accounting professions, among others. It is the most dramatic and frightening example of the utter collapse of integrity, honesty and all the other virtues we associated with the Protestant Ethic for over 200 years.     Remember, these gangsters are evading punishment, taking home unbelievable amounts of stolen money and re-forming to do it to us all over again. Just recall Mr. Mozilla of Countrywide who took home almost a half-billion dollars before his company failed and was rescued by an investment/commercial bank. As a result of this cataclysm, the ten biggest financial institutions now control 70% of the industry vs. 30% before the tsunami struck. If that means \\"too big to fail\\" remains the order of the day, then Wall Street will continue to take wild risks, knowing that our tax money will bail them out.     I hate to say this, but this one more reason that I've become ashamed of America and very pessimistic about her future.  This is a complete reversal from someone who's believed so passionately the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Protestant Ethic underlying them, something that enabled us to become the longest-lived Republic in human history. If this isn't a replay of the Roman Empire, 21st century-style, then I'm blind, deaf and dumb. As a matter of fact,I wouldn't mind that state so I don't have to see our country go off the cliff. Morals, integrity, industry, I guess they're considered quaint now. NOT FOR ME, NOT EVER!!     God SAVE America.
B003XRDYX2|4.0|I had all the early vinyl (except for Blonde On Blonde and John Wesley Harding).  Mine were all stereo, but I think I like these mono mixes better.<br /><br />It was great to relive my radical youth through Bob's original and very-well-written protest and other folk songs.  I also think he brought a hipness & better sense of humour to the folk-song movement.<br /><br />Lots of good information in the package.  Yeah, I'm glad I bought it.
B004B8DH98|5.0|This was a good, sound film with many layers. At this stage in Mr. Clooney's career he can pick and choose what speaks to his artistic expression. And he continues to doso in the last few films he's directed, produced and starred in. Of particuar note are the performances of the Italian players; superb! If one has been exposed to and can appreciate european cinema, then that's enough explaination. I was skeptical about this film when it came out. However, I waited as I knew it would be superb. A paralell film to this would be Deniro's Ronin. You just don't know what to expect and the pacing is far different than what an American audience is familiar with.
B00006AW2P|4.0|I never owned this vinyl, but borrowed a mate's copy, but his was a label-released cassette.<br /><br />From memory (that was about 15yrs ago), the sound quality on this CD is at least as good as that cassette.<br /><br />There's only 3 tracks I don't like, and my favourites (I'm A King Bee; Route 66; Carol; and Not Fade Away) show that the Stones were rivalling The Beatles and The Yardbirds in 1964.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm quite happy with this purchase.  It'll probably grow on me to the extent that I'll feel like giving it 5 stars down the track.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|There's also a 6 track CD sampler of songs from the film included in the Blu-Ray case.  Nice little extra, I thought.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|My title is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but I was waiting a long time for decent CD mixes (like the original vinyl) of Long Tall Sally and I Call Your Name.<br /><br />What a wonderful bonus, to have the original stereo mixes for Help! and Rubber Soul as well!  (Why couldn't they do it with Revolver? [& Pepper's & Mystery Tour?] - never mind, I already had them.)<br /><br />Wonderfully packaged, great information (but not as good as my Beatles reference books, but you can't expect that on a CD booklet).<br /><br />Because I only began buying records in the early 1970s (it was all Beatles at first), my album-purchases were all stereo, but I had a few singles & E.P.s (all mono).<br />In light of the above, it was so good to hear ALL the old stuff (well, not just the old stuff, right up to & including the 1968 'White Album') in mono.  I think most of the songs have so much more oomph in the mono mix.<br /><br />This makes sense after reading a few Chat submissions here on Amazon which claimed that John, Paul, George & Ringo were only involved with the mono mixes and left George Martin alone with the still relatively-new, almost-a-curiosity stereo mixes.<br /><br />The Beatles were 'heavy' for their time. They were always wanting to be 'heavy' - hence their constant search for bigger & better amps, especially for the bass. (Even on \\"Yesterday\\", they wanted the more hard-core Renaissance no-vibrato strings.)  You can hear much more drums (especially kick-drum) on the mono mixes - the original, intended-by-The Beatles sound.  George Martin was a great Producer & musician, but with all due respects, he was more into lighter, 'pop' music than the oomph of heavy rock.  These mono mixes bring back the original, heavier Beatles to CD.<br /><br />Having said that, I do still prefer the stereo mix on some tracks, but it's wonderful to hear all the mono mixes. (Some big differences on the 'outro's.)
0316098337|5.0|What a book! The story of Jack and his Ma are told in this book through Jack's eyes. I have to admit that in the beginning Jack's narration was a bit hard to follow but once I got used to Jack's language and world, the book flowed smoothly for me. Jack is a smart five year old but he and his Ma are held prisoner in a room, a very small room. Jack was born in the room and knows nothing else outside of the four walls of Room. Jack's Ma was kidnapped by Old Nick and has been held prisoner for 7 years. I was worried the subject matter of Room would be a bit too much for me but I found myself very interested in Jack and Ma's survival. It's amazing to me what they did to keep as sane as one can be, being held in a 11 x 11 shed. I don't want to give any more of the story away because this a book you need to experience as it happens. If I had known what was going to happen, I am afraid the book would not have had the same effect on me. This is a book best read in one sitting. Once I got into the story there was no putting it down. One thing that bugged me about the book was never knowing what Ma's name was. Most five year olds know what their mother's names are. It just struck me as odd that her name was never mentioned. This is one of those stories that will keep you thinking about it long after you finish the last page. I highly recommend this book! Emma Donoghue has taken a horrifying subject and turned it into something beautiful. It's both heartbreaking and heartwarming. I know that sounds crazy but read it and see what you think.<br /><br />Since writing this review it has been pointed out to me that Ma's name was revealed. It took me a bit of researching but her name is quietly revealed. I was very relieved to see that Ma had a name! Still a fantastic read! You don't want to miss it!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This was a good, fun movie.  You can watch it over and over again.  I bought it at Amazon.com great purchase.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|UPDATE:     Seems like the problem's been fixed.  Excellent app. great for a quick check on steam tables and the like :P      The current revision of the software force closes EVERY single time I try and ask for a computation.  It must be something to do with the Thunderbolt handsets as other reviewers also seem to have this problem.  Devs., could you please fix the issue?     If the app did not close for the calcs, it would have been great and the 1 star given would have easily been 4 or even 5 stars.
B002QFYJF4|5.0|A fantastic film, from a fantastic film maker. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a bit on the long side but still really awesom.
B003UESJH4|5.0|THIS IS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE FOR KIDS AS WELL AS ADULTS! YEAH THERE IS SOME CURSING IN IT BUT THATS WHAT WILL GET THE KIDS ATTENTION. IT IS A BEAUTIFULLY TOLD TRUE STORY AND EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT. COLIN FIRTH DID EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IN THIS ROLE AND HE WAS LOOKING AS HANDSOME AS ALWAYS :)
0756404738|5.0|I pre-ordered this, because name of the wind rocked my friggin socks off.  And then I plundered all 900+ pages in a few days.  It's a very well told and addictive story.  Kvothe gets a little randy in this one, which made the process of reading with a boner a little awkward, but it was such an awesome book.  Well done, Rothfuss! Well Done!
B002APU580|5.0|IM A VERY PICKY JUDGE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES BUT THIS IS MY FAVORITE! THEY STAYED VERY TURE TO THE BOOK ! THIS IS A MUST SEE! BEAUTIFULLY DONE CLASSIC! OH AND LETS NOT FORGET THEY PICKED A VERY HANDSOME MR DARCY!
B0045HCJFS|4.0|While the ending is pretty expected, it's still an interesting movie with a story line that keeps your attention through the entire film.  Worth watching I think.
031603438X|4.0|Between the title and reading other reviews, you know what this book is about - Keith Richards' life and travails.  I'll provide some basic reasons why you might want to read the book.    Arguably, the Rolling Stones (along with the Beatles) have made the biggest impact on Rock and Roll history. Consider all the rock bands since the early 60s up to the present that have come and gone.  For impact, quality of music, and longevity, the Stones reign supreme.  Now consider the key members of these two bands:  Mick Jagger, Keith Richards (John Lennon, Paul McCartney).  One can argue then, that Keith Richards has contributed more to rock and roll than any of the thousands who've written and played in the last 50 years. He's also the original rock bad boy with his indulgence in booze and drugs, and his arrests and other assorted adventures. Whether you're a fan of Rock, Blues, or otherwise, why would you not want to read about his life?  You would, and you should.  I highly recommend this book.    I found virtually every page had something interesting on it - yes, every page.  I read about twenty books a year, and this is the first time I can say every page of a book is interesting. The book seems to be written with much candor and honesty, and I learned a lot about his personal life, as well as that with the Stones, and other bands he formed, and musicians he played with.  I particularly liked the parts where he talks about his time in Jamaica and with his Rastafarian friends.  To me, the contents of this book are all fascinating and fun. If you're a guitar player or in the music business, you'll love the sections about open tuning; creating the best sound while recording; and about how and why he wrote some of his songs.  I also loved hearing about the many people he became friends with or worked with.  Several of them have also written small sections throughout the book where Keith figures it's better to let them write about experiences they shared, from their point ofview.    I would have loved this book to go for a thousand pages, that's how much I enjoyed it.  The small downside is that it ends a bit abruptly, and might have been improved if he brought the reader to a more gradual conclusion, and to the present.  Maybe even talk a bit about any current or future projects. Overall, this is a really interesting and fun book to read, about a guy who definitely has lived a life very different than most of us.     PS: Thanks for autographing my copy, Keith. Rich
1439190275|5.0|I am 5'3\\" 25 years old when I started atkins I weighted 197 lbs!!!  In four months I lost 62 lbs.  I did the induction period for the four months that was two years ago and I have not gained it back!  Yes, at times the food get boring, but my life at 197 lbs was more boring!
B002RI9ZQ8|2.0|I must agree with the small minority who gave one or two stars to this novel. It starts at a good fast pace and you hav a feeling that you are into a good thing  but then slows down and goes on interminably to the point where you are starting to wonder whether you should give it up . Most friends who read it had similar thoughts.<br /><br />Personally i think it was a mastership in salesmanship!!!
0060936223|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  My sister and daughter are both artists.  As I was reading I kept thinking how much they would love this book.  The \\"name dropping\\" is matter-of fact because Patti interacted with so many artists and musicians in the late sixties and early seventies.  It was great to be given an insider's view of that era.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Very large. Only have about an inch clearance to side of case. Dropped idle temps on i5 750 about 14 degrees to 34c. Fan extremely close to blocking a ram slot but still fits. Quieter than stock Intel. Install can be a little tricky; cut out in case allowed me to not have to remove the motherboard for install.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I honestly love this app. It's a lifesaver. I can write notes to myself, make checklists, color code them, sort alphabetically, sort by status.. The only thing i could even think of adding is a due date or some sort of linking method (that'd probably be way too complex, though.) I tried several before finding this one, and honestly, I'm so glad I did.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|love the checklist option, makes a great grocery list!  easy to use and navigate, especially the option to color code your notes! great app! my favorite notepad that I have downloaded.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Wonderful! I didn't think anyone could top Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, But Alfie Boe was great! Such a powerful voice! Nick Jonas was good as Marius,not as good as Michael Ball in the tenth anniversary version. Wish I could pick and choose my favorites and have them play together...
B0039PPW60|5.0|This little mixer has the professional quality I require and I'm using this mixer combined with Cubase 6 software.  I am happy to be using this to finish up my vocals on a progressive rock project to be mixed by the famed Terry Brown(RUSH).  The Mice Pres have a wonderful warm and forward quality to them.  The ease of use of the board is helping me complete a few singles that I am working on to include a Rap tune that will be spit by a member of the famed band Digital Underground, and another to be sung by the #1 Billboard charting Latin pop star Viva Angelina Sky.      It was so easy to set up and begin working with.  I exchange aif files with my clients and other musiles from around the world, that I work with, and everyone has mentioned they are loving the vocal sounds.  I think it's the Mic Pres!  The mix between studio applications and live possibilities are awesome, too.  The portability gives one a lot of options.  I received it in perfect timing for me to complete my session work that was in lockdown from my previous equipment breakdown.  I ordered from the dealer, they shipped in in my desired timeframe, I had it hooked up and I was on a phone patch studio session on schedule!  AWESOME!    I recommend it.  You can hear some of the new material on my website, [...] , as I begin to upload it, soon!!
0756990696|5.0|I remember as a youth I did not read a lot, and since this time things have changed. I do also remember this book playing a role in developing my appreciation for reading - and acknowledge that it will not be a book for all. You must want to think, consider, and ponder many things. If you just want a plot with a climax, solution, and ending this may not be the book. If you want to go for a mental journey this may indeed be the one.<br /><br />Great read, and a read that the inquisitive mind may enjoy. Not for all, but if you want somthing new to sink your reading neuerons into - this may be the one.
B003BWERF8|1.0|Just got this and was anxious to try it with my iPod.  I'm using a Plantronics BB903+ headphone that I have paired easily with my iTouch and my Android phone.  Well the i10s just is not getting it done.  I figure the range is about 2 ft when it connects at all.  If I sit perfectly still I can get through a short song without an interruption.  The transmitter is probably just not putting out the power needed to make a decent connection.  It seems smaller may not always be better.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This cable worked exactly as advertised.  Just be careful you order what you want.  I was THINKING 3 feet, and ordered 3 METERS.  I now have excess cable behind my iMac, but the image quality is great!  My bust, NOT the product.
B004L49K20|4.0|I can't believe it: Duran Duran has released an album I LIKE again!  I've listened to them since Rio came out in 1982. Back then, I bought it all: Japanese imports, 12\\" singles, EP's.  I've had mixed reactions to everything they've put out since Notorious, which to me was their last great record, from start-to-finish.  The absolute WORST was Liberty in 1990. That album was complete garbage (with the exception of \\"Violence of Summer\\").  But now...now this...  Not since Nile Rodgers remixed \\"The Reflex\\" have I been so enamored with the band. I didn't think it would happen again, but this album has at long last recaptured the Duran Duran I remember and love.  It's the first Duran album in ages where several songs stick in my head! Amazing! The arrangements and production finally FEEL like Duran Duran again.  And the musicianship: I can hear John Taylor's spectacular bass playing like I remember. Nick Rhodes trademark keys / synth work are also there. This album is most reminiscent to me of the song \\"Electric Barbarella\\" - a great electro track that wouldn't sound out of place on AYNIN.  I hope this is not the last time they work with Mark Ronson, for it has truly yielded superb results.
B004ISVH6G|4.0|So lucky that we still have some artist still wanting to create music, and bring instruments out on the road and actually play live.  Just like Billy Joel Live, John always includes an old tune from the past (Mr. Wonderful) on his new releases.  It seems like the older the songs and John gets, the better they sound.  Great new songs as always, Skyward, If you ever get lonely, and the Title Track.  Also a Tina Turner song, worth the price of the CD.  Only four stars, because no release in Vinyl.  Life's cheap.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I was disappointed in the way the book ended.  I was left hanging.  Is there going to be a sequel????
0811870413|5.0|The proof is in the pudding!  I bought this book after reading so much about Chad Robertson's amazing bread.  I followed the recipe in the book et voir là! Perfect bread!  Love the photos.  Love the presentation.  Love the bread!  Love your work Chad!
0316056863|5.0|Smart, sharp-witted, keenly observant of human nature, funny, articulate on page and on stage, attractive (that singular tween photo excepted!), loving of parents, wise/honest mother, evidently a good employee and boss. Not fair, I say. But at least she shares. I expected to laugh, and sure did, but the wisdom on topics from work to survival in a looks-obsessed world to parenthood came as an unexpected bonus.
B000WITSZS|4.0|and they all comment on how this band doesn't live up to Sabbath, Zeppelin, and so on. Look this album rocks. Many people from the classic rock era are stuck in their ways, I get it, but this band has a flavor of their own, while maintaining the \\"classic rock\\" sound. I recommend getting the Australian version of this album. The arrangement of songs flows much better than the US release. Songs 1 - 7 are brilliant, then the band starts trying new things with the last several songs. Here is the track listing:       1. \\"Colossal\\" - 5:02     2. \\"Woman\\" - 2:55     3. \\"White Unicorn\\" - 5:01     4. \\"Pyramid\\" - 4:28     5. \\"Mind's Eye\\" - 4:53     6. \\"Joker & the Thief\\" - 4:39     7. \\"Dimension\\" - 4:25     8. \\"Where Eagles Have Been\\" - 5:32     9. \\"Apple Tree\\" - 3:28    10. \\"Tales from the Forest of Gnomes\\" - 3:35    11. \\"Witchcraft\\" - 3:25    12. \\"Vagabond\\" - 3:47    Starting with Colossal all the way through Dimension, Wolfmother pushes the throttle and doesn't let up. This album and this version gives me goosebumps every time I listen. Stop comparing this band to the greats of the past, objectively listen to this album, and you will not be let down.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I purchased this book after reading several glowing reviews. I keep thinking the reviews I read were for a different novel with the same title. No such luck. The story centers around Dr. Diana Bishop, a reluctant witch who is extraordinarily dull. Other than finding a perfect vampire boyfriend, and discovering some magical powers, she does nothing very interesting. The end of the book was frustrating because it hinted that the couple might be on the brink of finally doing something, and then it ends. Yes, it is brainy and brings up some interesting ideas about origins, but most of the book could be condensed into a couple of chapters. Fool that I am, I kept reading, believing that the action was right around the corner, but it never materialized. Great idea; poor development.
0143118706|4.0|Great book, even though it wasnt, quite what I was expexting to read, after reading \\"Eat, Pray and Love\\", by Elizabeth Gilbert.  But I would still highly recomment it to anyone who likes her writtings.  Thanks.[[ASIN:0143118706 Committed: A Love Story]]
B004GYY714|4.0|Nice app. Smooth interface. An earlier review claimed that it blocked incoming phone calls. Don't know what their problem was but this app works great on my Droid X.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this CD,it is made in the raw and when listening to it you can tell it has not been messed with at all. When Adele opens that soulful instrutment,the most beautiful stars of all colors come out to one's delight. I thought her first Cd(Adele 19)was just awesome,but as she has said in many interviews,that her music has changed in a way that only reflects her maturity.Adele is real and very much down to earth and she just lets the song take control as it is meant to come out! I find myself,just as I did when Adele 19 came out,listening to it over and over and loving it ever more!
0143034901|2.0|The Cons: This book is an overdose of adjectives, aphorisms, and recycled metaphors.  Head hopping is a major problem and the story is narratively confused.  Random sections are written in italics... I couldn't tell you why.  Some major characters are just plain annoying, like the moronic, longwinded best friend and the vapid, flat villain, while others, like the knocked up girlfriend, have no personality at all.  Things are way too easy for the main character, and there are way too many convenient coincidences. The book is at least thirty pages too long.<br /><br />Zafon's writing style does not merit comparisons to that of Borges or Garcia Marquez. (In the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and in Penelope's death respectively, Zafon plagiarizes from the two writers, but this doesn't seem like something he should receive acclaim for). Like an obnoxious tour guide, the writing drags you through what would otherwise be an engaging read.  Zafon doesn't trust his readers to infer anything, instead he wacks you over the head with every detail multiple times.  Shadows were mentioned on every page, in the same metaphors, used again and again.<br /><br />Now the Pros: The plot is, at times, engrossing.  Before the thirty terrible pages tacked on to the end, the story was beginning to more than fulfill the promising concept.  I loved reading about the past of Julian and Nuria.  I found their story compelling, which is why this book is getting more than a one star review.  I can't figure out why this book was critically well received.  I loved it occasionally, hated it often, and mostly feel frustrated.
0316056863|4.0|I almost gave this book 5 stars, and it is damn near perfect.<br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff:<br />- It's extremely funny. And not just \\"laugh out loud\\" funny, but \\"laugh *so* out loud your spouse asks you to go read in another room because you're keeping him awake\\" funny. If you enjoy Tina Fey's humor, you'll really appreciate this book. It's damn funny.<br /><br />- It's (unexpectedly) full of really good advice about how to be a good boss. I mean, maybe I should have gleaned that from the title but I expected it to be more of a comedic autobiography than a sincere look at how to effectively manage people. And she's got some really great thoughts in this book about how to be a leader.<br /><br />- Where books by other comedians are pretty much only for laughs (see: Chelsea Handler), this book also contains some social critique. And, not in a preachy way - in a very funny way. But Fey raises some excellent questions about how women treat each other, being a working mom, dealing with institutionalized sexism, and other hilarious topics!<br /><br />I found myself wanting to know a bit more about SNL, or 30 Rock, but she keeps those experiences (and her personal life) at a pretty surface level. It appears to be a very conscious choice, and one I respect; you can tell she doesn't want to be a tell-all kind of person, and she's not interested in being the sort of celebrity that rips her whole life open for all to see.<br /><br />All-in-all, I loved this book and devoured it in one day (not an easy feat with two preschool-aged kids running around).<br /><br />My only gripe is that it's a little hard to tell what this book is trying to be. It's part comedy, part biography and part managerial guidance/life lessons. Not that that's a bad combination - it was just a little unexpected. And, at times, felt a little jumpy.
B003UMW66G|5.0|Great movie, definitely recommend if you like philosophical kung-fu movies in the mold of Fearless or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

B003UESJHY|5.0|I was not sure I really wanted to ever watch this movie but I am so glad I did.  Christian Bale was totally deserving of his best supporting actor win at the Academy Awards.  It is a movie that stays with you after you watch it and you fell connected to the real life persons that the movie represents.
0756404738|5.0|A brilliant continuation to a great book. Easily the best book of the year, and one of the greatest fantasy books, and books in general in years. Highly recommended.
B002N8A14M|4.0|I read all the reviews, good and bad and have to admit I wasn't sure if I wanted this item at all. But since I received it and started using it, the positive outweighed the bad.   I have had no problems assembling the case or fitting my Ipod in it, but I do however, have to admit a small frustration with inserting the earphone jack. With some persistance it pushed in and has been able to be easily removed and replaced as I want. Not as big a deal as I thought.    I also really enjoy the clip that came as part of the clear plastic case. Unless one is violent with it, there's no reason it should break or crack unless defective upon arrival. It's perfect in the waistband and holds on very tightly and is a great option if you don't want to use the armband.    Overall, I have to say I'm very happy with this product and I would certainly recommend it.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This film is absolutely amazing!  It was my first introduction to Japanese film, and I was totally blown away. Mifune's (my favorite actor EVER!) role was not as significant in this film as in later Kurasawa film's, but all the actors are excellent.    Kurasawa is (IMHO) the best director I have ever seen, and Toshiro Mifune was the best actor. Yojimbo (the source for \\"A Fistful Of Dollars\\" and \\"Ronin\\") was my favorite, because it brought everything down to a manageable level--not thousands of people warring on each side---the big spectacles--like Kurasawa's RAN--although great--tend to lose me.    For people who have only experienced Japanese film as Godzilla movies, this is a great---and humbling--introduction to films that are better written, better acted, and better directed, than our American films of the \\"Golden Age\\". Imagine: every director as talented as (or better than Orson Welles), and every actor as good as (or better than) John Garfield!  That was Japanese cinema in the '50s.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I won't kid you, this movie is visually breathtaking and just so different that I really wound up dreaming about it after I saw it - just because it's so new to your mind and so pretty.  I can't begin to express how pretty the movie is.<br /><br />That said, this movie was very close to being very bad in a lot of ways.  It does appear that Disney spent their money on the visuals and the really good writers were too busy working on [[ASIN:B004G6009K Tangled (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy)]] because there were elements of the storyline that were either lacking, cheesy, or just superficial.  The whole club scene with an overacting club owner inside the machine was just not believable and the acting was just plain bad.  At the same time, the whole yin/yang, nouvou hippy, my-zen mindset that Jeff Bridges had through the movie also just didn't come across as very real. But hey, that's just me.  The biggest issue I had though was that the movie is called TRON (trace program) and is supposed to be a super program that flynn developed to break into and out of anything --- well TRON is a very minor character and he doesn't speak (kindof like the STIG from Top Gear)....really?  I kindof expected TRON to do more.  Don't get me wrong, TRON is still out there and that's good but I just expected TRON to feature more prominently: he is the name of the movie.<br /><br />All of the shortfalls that I saw were made up by  a few things:<br /><br />- the gorgeous sets<br />- the mere fact that a remake was made<br />- the novelty of the concept<br /><br />I will warn the average person that this movie might not be for you.  It is most certainly fanciful science fiction.  It gets a  lot of stars from those of us who love it but that most definitely does not mean that YOU are going to like it.<br /><br />For the die hards, I really don't have much to add, everything is here from the original, lightcycles, disc throwing, etc.<br /><br />Overall, it's not perfect (mostly because of some of the writing and some cheesy scenes) but it comes a long way from the original.<br /><br />Oh, yes get the bluray and watch it at night with the sound system turned up - you will not be disappointed.  The sound is gorgeous also.nes) but it comes a long way from the original.    Oh, yes get the bluray and watch it at night with the sound system turned up - you will not be disappointed.  The sound is gorgeous also.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|If you go to war with a Machete, what do you think your going to get ?<br /><br />The answer is blood.<br /><br />This is a very graphic, and bloody movie ... but that's why it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />It's just a MOVIE !!!!<br /><br />To tell you the truth, it's not all about blood shed.<br />After a few killing scenes, Machete turns into a good movie with a great story plot.<br /><br />I give this movie 4/5<br />(four out of five stars, only because i've watched it over twenty times)<br /><br />The female actors in this movie are fantastic.<br />If they don't get your attention, then nothing will.
B001CTDH58|3.0|As a fan of the first Beverly Hills Chihuahua movie, I was a little disappointed in the sequel. It was the casting, the original cast was far superior and I tried but couldn't get over it. I have watched the original several times but I don't think I will watch the sequel again.
B000002GFT|5.0|While Fairport Convention has made many fine albums, Leige and Leaf is thier best effort. There is not one weak track on the whole CD. A spectacular performance by Sandy Denny and the band is instrumentally note perfect. You really can't go wrong with this CD. There is nothing not to love about Leige and Leaf.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|My spirits soared with this movie. I laughed. I cried with happiness. It was sweet without being overly sappy. Rachel McAdams was cute and quirky. Diane Keaton played a tough cookie and Harrison Ford was THE grumpy old man you wanted to change. I loved this movie.
0486282112|1.0|Frankenstein's a classic, and I'm sure that most of you reading this will have either read it or at least heard it discussed. Shelley's novel is very interesting both from a historical perspective and in how it approaches the horror genre. Frankenstein is a book, however, not an interesting piece of memorabilia, and my high expectations while reading it were not so much matched as smashed to pieces.<br /><br />When compared to other classic horror authors, Shelley's outlook is interesting in that it seems to be one profoundly antithetical to horror. Shelley's world is a fascinating place passionately described. Landscapes, waterways, and glaciers are all rendered vivid at the stroke of her pen, and there is a vastness to her settings - to the waters which, at one point, bear her protagonist haplessly away from his destination or from the freezing arctic where both the tale's frame and conclusion takes place. All that might be superficially relatable to the feeling of the world as a dangerous place that one gets with many horror authors, but while Shelley's world is a dangerous place, it's never a frightening one. That's not to say that Shelley does not attempt to invoke fear, mind you, but her fear comes entirely from what's known to man, from what man creates. The natural world here is, at times, both invigorating setting and potentially lethal setback, but it is never the enemy itself, and there is never the claustrophobic feeling that Shelley's world is populated by the unknown. Her  horror comes purely from man, a horror that is frightening precisely because it comes from man.<br /><br />Shelley is, in many ways, the exact opposite of Lovecraft (who tackled similar themes in Herbert West - Reanaimator). Lovecraft took a resolutely rational approach to portraying the irrational, an atheist evoking towering monstrosities to show just how empty our world really is. Shelley, on the other hand, takes an irrational route to portraying the rational. Shelley's writing isn't precisely spiritual, but she does constantly invoke the supernatural with regards to chance, motivation, and the outcome of events (\\"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter destruction.\\" (p. 23)), all the while making her monster strictly scientific and rational in nature, albeit impossible by any natural laws. The romanticism of the text - the feeling that the world is something vast and wondrous all around us to be felt and experienced - shifts for the chapters that the monster narrates. The monster is scientific in his outlook, piecing together our world from observation and trial and error. There is a lot of stumbling around in these sections, and the outcome of the monster's tale is rather obvious, but these sections are still by far the most powerful of the book.<br /><br />Everyone knows the basic story of Frankenstein, I think: Victor Frankenstein makes a monster from dead flesh, and the monster's not the nicest of fellows, though one must admit that it's rage is somewhat justifiable. The key flaw in Frankenstein is the near total lack of tension, caused both by wordiness and a horrendously loose plot. Shelley's prose is very much driven by the character's emotional state. Her writing latches onto an event and circles around and around on it, pontificating at such length on the most minute matters that it soon manages to loop around entirely and contradict itself. On page 141, we learn that: \\"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.\\" Then, on the very next page: \\"Indeed, as the period [of our marriage] approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty.\\" (p. 142) Both being terrified and undisturbed, now that's a feat of cognitive dissonance, Victor.<br /><br />As for the actual plotting, one would be able to reach roughly a hundred of this book's hundred and sixty-seven pages and assume it had nothing whatsoever to do with any monster. In the author's reprinted foreword, we learn that Shelley intended Frankenstein to be a short story but was persuaded to make it a novel. The signs of filler are everywhere; the book is an exercise in the most lax plotting, and bloat practically bursts forth from its seemingly slight page count.<br /><br />The novel's frame story is a man exploring the arctic who stumbles upon Victor in pursuit of his monster. Those opening pages are told through letters from the man to his sister. But here's the catch: Frankenstein is not spotted until page eight, and his story does not begin for several more pages. The opening scenes of the story are spent setting up the frame character who is almost wholly irrelevant to the novel. It's a slight matter, admittedly, but it's a sign of the excess to come.<br /><br />Frankenstein is ashamed of his creation and does his best to try and put it out of sight and out of mind. That's totally fine. It's believable and shows every scene of leading to personal struggle and all that. But it's taken to absurd lengths. Frankenstein flees his apartment when he creates the monster, and then proceeds to do nothing about it. It only really becomes important again when he's about to lead a friend into his abode: \\"I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\\" (p. 38) Bringing dead tissue to murderous and horrible life is upsetting, sure, but if our friends saw it'd just be too much! Read a bit too fast and you might be left with the impression that Frankenstein isn't worried so much about breaking all natural and moral laws but rather the playboys he might've left in plain sight.<br /><br />Perhaps I should give Victor a bit more leeway, though. After all, he'd just been subjected to a rather bad shock. Shortly after, he comes down with a debilitating fever, and maybe we should excuse him for his actions. In fact, the book seems to be looking up. He's heading back, and it seems that something terrible has happened n his absence. If this was the only instance of bizarre nonchalance, it'd almost not be worth mentioning. But it is, of course, not the only instance. Far from it. Frankenstein is a master of fretting. He has perfected the art of completely ignoring the monstrosity he's created for pages on end while he does absolutely nothing, all the while thinking about how he must hurry to resolve the situation before it rends him and all he loves limb from limb.<br /><br />The worst example of this comes when Victor  takes a multi-month sightseeing tour of the United Kingdom. This section is infuriating. Perpetually horrified, Frankenstein takes the time out of his busy schedule to visit tourist attraction after tourist attraction. These are, every one of them, described. Not in terms of the plot, or even in terms of how the character feels about them. Nope. We just get to have brief history lessons: \\"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavoring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden...\\" (p. 117) It goes on like that. For pages.<br /><br />Sadly, when Frankenstein does come around to the point, it's not much better. Now, there are effective sections. The problem is that they're few and far apart. The majority of the books climactic scenes drown whatever genuine emotion there was to be found in torrents of melodrama, obscuring tragedy with phrases like: \\"The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured\\" (p. 129). The core of the novel is never described to the reader. Any chance of us developing our own terror of the monster is smothered by Victor's awe inspiring gushing.<br /><br />The issue is not truly the scenes of action themselves but rather Frankenstein's general personality. He responds to every event with rapture or terror; he is incapable of concluding the simplest sentence without an emotional exclamation point, a habit that's rendered even more grating when coupled with his indecisiveness. When first confronted by the monster's demands, he says: \\"'I do refuse it [...] and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.'\\" (p. 104) Then, after a single page, he admits: \\"I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\\" (p. 105) The end result of such effusive dialogue is a thundering hesitancy, a narrative filled with grand declarations that, ultimately, amounts to nothing at all.<br /><br />If Frankenstein had been written last year, I would have declared it turgid and sworn never to read the author again. As it's a classic, however, my disappointment's mixed with incredulity. Frankenstein is not bereft of virtues. The premise is excellent, but it's horribly executed. The monster's perspective was interesting, but it's highly digressive (even if less so than the main narrative). And so on. Frankenstein may be worth reading for its historical value, but, as a novel, I found its every page miserable.<br /><br />[Note: all page numbers from the Dover Thrift Edition]be we should excuse him for his actions.

B000JLSLZQ|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is a 5-star film and blu ray. The colors and details were truly awesome. After reading a review from [...]reviews, I was convinced to buy this movie on Blu-ray based on the rating of Hd video and Audio. Sorry it's not a real defined and bullet-pointed review, but I really enjoyed this movie and wanted to rate it!
140120841X|5.0|Alan Moore's V for Vendetta explores power, morality, and responsibility, and it manages - incredibly enough - to do justice to all three themes. The novel is a powerful and intelligent story that's a classic of its genre, one that is far more complex than it seems (and it doesn't seem particularly simple to start off with).    [Note: the following review contains SPOILERS]    The first thing that has to be understood about V for Vendetta is that it's a text filled with questions and bereft of answers, both on a large and small scale. Who is V? We never find out. We find out just enough to create a compelling theory, and we know the sensational parts of his back-story, but everything from his name to his childhood is obscured. V is an enigma, and he remains an enigma, the actual man insignificant when compared to what he represents. As he says: \\"There's no flesh or blood within this cloak to kill. There's only an idea. Ideas are bullet proof.\\" (p. 236) He does not fit the archetype of hero. His every action, from his outlandishly disguised identity to his quote-filled dialogue, is fit more for the stage than for the battlefield.    In mannerism, the character he most resembles is the Joker. Both came from backgrounds of chemicals and insanity; the joker (depending on your origin story of choice), some kind of deviant who fell into a chemical vat, and V a man sorely abused and altered by hormonal testing at a concentration camp. Each of them sport an almost comical grin whilst sowing chaos, and each is flamboyant in dress (a purple suit here finding its counterpart in long hair and cape) and actions. This Vicious Cabaret of V for Vendetta's second act and the humorous man-as-employee speech of his is even similar to the Joker's song in Moore's Killing Joke (released shortly after V's serialized beginning). Of course, that's not to suggest that This Vicious Cabaret is equivalent to the Joker's song or V to the Joker. Joker maliciously cackles and spouts discontinuities and absurdities; V soliloquizes and quotes Shakespeare, a Joker tied to an enormous and incomprehensible intellect and pitted against a foe so dark that the maniacal one of the pair is actually the hero. Norsefire, too, can be roped into the comparison. Completing the utter inversion of your archetypical comic book, the villain here is Batman. Batman and Noresefire both overpower their foes with technologies and are muted in tone when compared to the vibrancy of their antagonists. More importantly, both emphasize order over everything else; Noresefire perhaps being comparable to Batman's utopia gone awry, crime prevented at all costs. Perhaps this was the end that Fox feared when Batman showed his technological mastery as The Dark Knight came to a climax.    So V is the good guy. But can you really call him that? V is a revolutionary and not in the blandly heroic sense. There are hard choices that must be made when overthrowing a society, and V does not hesitate to make them. He kills again and again over the course of the novel. Some of his victims are the high ranking fascists of Norsefire, and so the reader can, perhaps, give him a pass on that, thinking that tyrants deserve what they get. What's harder to excuse are those that die along the way. V blows up several government installations, not only killing the leaders but every man inside from sadistic secret policemen to janitors. As we see in Vertigo (one of the two bonus chapters), V can even be sadistic in his pursuit of his goals, not only killing his enemies but striving to emulate their methods and degrade them even in the moment of their demise. Harder still to excuse is the psychological torture that V causes, both to Rose Almond and to Evey, whom he'd led to believe he would protect. V was made who he was through the brutality of Norsefire's concentration camps and experiments, yet he has no qualms about using the same methods to achieve his own ends; he has willingly embraced the effectiveness of the enemy in his attempt to bring them down.    In addition to taking Norsefire's physical and interrogative methods, V usurps Norsefire's symbolism. Norsefire was a fundamentally unapproachable dictatorship that communicated with the people by trying to make itself both unquestionable and down to earth. The voice of Fate accomplished both tasks, undoubtable due to its moniker and its lack of competitors and relatable by means of helpfully reporting the weather in the midst of its warnings. In order to compete, V needs to be more than a man. His guy fawkes mask becomes an icon, the mystery of his identity a larger than life dilemma that the government cannot solve. When he appears to the public, his tone is, as it almost always is, theatrical and humorous. Like the supposed voice of the computerized Fate, he sets himself apart from those he addresses even as he claims to have their own best interest at heart.    And yet one of Norsefire's directors says that the the Noresfire regime never capitalized on symbolism, a statement that is simply bewildering. Norsefire is a totalitarian regime styled on the Nazis. Yet it claims to have avoided symbolism. How is such a thing even possible? Furthermore, the claim flies directly in the face of the regime's use of the voice of fate. Thinking further, however, I realized that - with the exception of Fate - Norsefire is curiously devoid of the common trappings of an oppressive regime. There is no one unified style to the cities. The enforcement of law is left to openly acknowledged thugs recruited off the street, lacking even a recognizable uniform. Cameras are watching, yet we never see them do it. We're told that Norsefire is evil and invasive, and we get proof of it to some extent in the first chapter's sting operation (though, to be fair, such a thing's not so outlandish that you need a fictional tyrant to conceive), but examples after that are hard to come by. Moore and Lloyd are so focused on depicting Norsefire's fall thatthey essentially neglect its rise and reign. We see incredible brutality from flashbacks, but the present day storyline shows Norsefire as nothing much besides a tad evasive. Without ever seeing its effects on a significant number of characters, it's hard to feel the organized evil that we are obviously intended to feel. Still, such things are easy to forgive. After all, the strength of Moore's writing isn't what it says about his fictional world but rather about what it says about our own.    V is an idealist. He is fighting for equality, yes, but he is not fighting for justice. V is, as he himself proclaims time and time again, an anarchist. This is not a sugar coated anarchism, soon evolving into democracy or whatever model of a just society you, the reader, happen to believe in. No, V's byword is chaos, and disorder is his ultimate aim. As V asserts more and more of his power, and as the state crumbles around him, we are not entering a utopia. The dubious morality of the opening - prostitutes accosted, killed, and raped by secret policemen - is exchanged for a world of lootings and riots. Will this transition into something better, the security of Norsefire without the oppression? There's no way to tell, but it's plain that V could never bring such a world around, could not even stand aside and let it happen. That is why Finch, Norsefire's arbiter of justice, must kill him.    Finch is, in many ways, comparable to V. He shares V's desire for equality and admits to himself that he knew that Norsefire was wrong, oppressive, and unjust all along. And yet he went along with them, joined them, played a part in leading them. Why? His own answer is weakness, but it's not clear that things are so simple. V focuses exclusively on the big picture. In order to bring down Norsefire, he will do anything. On a personal scale, V commits horrible crimes. He is no common criminal, though, but rather a revolutionary; these small crimes are steps along the way. The people he killed entering the television station were necessary in order for him to broadcast his message and help the general good.    Finch chooses the opposite path. He is a police officer. For him, the personal crimes against individuals cannot be allowed to continue; he must hunt V down, no matter the cost or overall morality of the hunt, because V has killed those around him. In return, Finch does his best to turn a blind eye to the overall results of Norsefire's actions. Unlike V, however, Finch is conflicted and unsatisfied with his choice. His world does not allow for the black and white absolutes of V's. The regime he supports puts monsters on the streets and gives them guns and uniforms. It leads to rapes and murders on scales small and large, injustices that Finch cannot account or atone for. Pushed away from that society, however, Finch is cut adrift and wanders, aimless.    What will happen to society after V's death? It is obvious that Norsefire was inimical to freedom and justice, and it is equally obvious that V's perfect, utopian anarchy cannot last. But what is to replace it? We're left, at the end, with Evey behind V's mask, a new symbol to lead us into a new world. But what kind of person is Evey? The Evey of the novel's beginning is obviously unsuitable for such a role. She bends her principles for her survival, an action too human to be grandly symbolic. Left without enough to eat, she tries to turn to prostitution, and only V's timely arrival averts her untimely death. The Evey of the novel's middle is, likewise, ill-fitting. She goes so far as to become happy with the enemy, living with one of Norsefire's leading members and managing to turn a blind eye to the pain all around her. The Evey of the novel's end, however, is a very different beast. Brought to and then over the brink by V's molding, by his cruelty, she rejects her own wellbeing for the sake of her principles. She is, finally, fit to take V's place. But is she fit to usher in a new world? She was, after all, made in the same way that V was. Is it possible to make two different creations with the same method? There's no way to know. Our only hint to the positive comes when V offers her vengeance - and she declines. There is, as the novel closes, a chance that things will change for the better. And, of course, a chance that they will simply deteriorate further.    Towards the novel's end, V says: \\"There is no coincidence, only the illusion of coincidence.\\" Though V seems like a reactionary beast, ala the Joker, he is actually a deep planner, though there's no way to tell exactly what was planned and what was a welcome coincidence. Every layer seems more impossible than the last, and yet each seems to support itself. However far down his machinations go, V is a master manipulator, and he plays the characters of the novel like puppets. Though he does, on several occasions, fight himself, V is not an action hero. Once the initial stage of violence has passed, V's plan turns to one of building tensions and turning the hierarchy of Norsefire against itself.    When a key portion of your plot is concerned with the gradual changes in the relationship of a large cast, it's obviously instrumental that that cast be both expansive and, more importantly, distinctive. The cast list seems to grow exponentially as the novel progresses, and some of the minor players can be hard to keep track of, but the various character driven twists of the ending feel organic and natural. Moore proves capable of characterization with only a few words, and the juxtaposition of scenes is excellent, though not quite to the degree of Watchmen. One scene shows various key Norsefire members conspiring in the pews while a preacher gives his oration, his words manipulative and apocalyptic while the various members of the directorate muse on V's actions and their own.      V for Vedetta doesn't distribute its pages equally among its characters. There's always one dominant storyline running, and other characters either appear in the periphery or not at all. As to what that dominant story is, the focus shifts considerably over the course of the novel, and there are quite a few sections focusing on events almost unrelated to V (though generally caused by him). These subplots are given their own space to develop, which makes the individual issues/chapters satisfying in their own right. On the other hand, some events that are never given the spotlight end up coming out as shallow. The head of Norsefire's dependence on Fate is well established, but how quickly he turns into a slobbering mess after Fate is gone makes it hard to imagine him ever coming to dominate a high school technology class, let alone the UK.    Lloyd's art style is a dark one, realistic in feel for all but V, who struts across the page while fitting in as (brilliantly) poorly with his background as he does with his world. The best part of the art is that it is mature. This is a gritty text, devoid of the juvenility of sound effects and their ilk. All that being said, Lloyd seems to struggle with the volume of characters. I can't conclusively say how much is the fault of his style and how much is a simple result of my relative unfamiliarity with the graphic form, but the secondary and tertiary members of the cast easily blend together, and a few main characters are, at times, difficult to distinguish. This is especially bad for the female characters, and that's magnified further still by the scenes taking place in the more stylized location of the nightclub; I'll admit that I had to reread an entire section because I wrongly identified the acting character in just about every frame of it.    If you're looking for a heroic read, something filled with heroes for whom you can stand up and cheer, V for Vendetta will fill your expectations for a handful of pages before leaving you cold and alone, sickened by what's passed. This world is sprawling, both alien and familiar, and it's cast is treated horribly, often by the very people who (supposedly) have their best interests at heart. Though Moore isn't always successful at displaying life under Norsefire's regime, he's a master at showing how his characters attempt to cope with such a reality. In interviews, Moore's said that the inspiration for the book was his unease with Thatcher's government. Nowadays, in a world scarred by the twin towers burning, it would be perfectly justifiable to read the text as an examination of terrorism and the methods used to combat it. I predict that, decades from now, other potential readings will appear and will be just as valid, because what Moore's created here truly transcends the years in which it was written and the paper that it's written on.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I was so stoked when I heard this was going to be on Blu-ray. I'm from the great state of Pennsylvania, so Rockys mean alot to me. I remember watching these movies with my dad and uncles, and what great times. It's great though to see these movies in Hd video and audio now. I enjoy many of the extras of what this collection offers, for example I love seeing all the makeup and filming of the fights was very extraordinary. I sold all my dvds, and got the upgrade.  Go Rocky!!!
0670022411|3.0|This book had much hype going for it and while I'm not a big romance or fantasy reader, it sounded intruiging so I gave it an earnest try. The author writes beautifully and I gobbled up the first half to two-thirds of the book in no time. At that point however, what had started as a terrific adventure/mystery yarn with dashes of history, romance and humor, transformed into a full-blown romance/paranormal story that required too much suspension of disbelief  as it wore on. Gone was the academic and literary bent, in was a witches vs daemons vs vampire Twilight-ish saga.     The direction in which the story was headed was frustrating and it dragged, but I forced myself to read through to the end - which was disappointing, anti-climatic and flat. It was also obvious that a sequel (or two or three) is already in the works.      Ms. Harkness is an extremely talented author and has a lovely way with words. It just seems that she tried to cover too many bases and the story lost its identity somewhere along the way.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great app, I can finally have access to ALL my music without carrying multiple devices. Took 37 hours to upload it all, but now I have an off-site backup AND the ability to access almost anywhere. Those of you that are on Sprint and having difficulty streaming see another review here to resolve. Don't blame Amazon.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This is simply one of the best Fantasy books I've ever read. This is, in my opinion, better than George R R Martin and light-years beyond most contemporary authors.<br />I'm a huge devourer of Fantasy books and it's rare to say the least that what I read sticks with me for hours after putting the book away. (Or Kindle, in my case). This book accomplishes so many things; it has details where there needs to be, it has charm and humor in unexpected places, and yet even though the Hero Kvothe is indeed a Hero - he is a \\"humanized\\" Hero with proper motivations and with real fear of death.<br /><br />I've given out 5 stars before, some of which I now regret because I should've reserved them for books like this.
055358894X|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I jumped in to this one. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the whole \\"heist\\" idea. I find the characters here really unique and fun to read. Plus, the narrative has a feel about it that had me constantly wanting to return to the story and world.    I also think the author does a superlative job of setting and ambience. I had a very good feel for \\"where\\" I was, and not just what the characters were doing or thinking. I don't always get that sense, even in fantasy, which should be rich with setting. So, kudos to the writer on that.    I'll be following the writer, and look forward to more tales set in this universe. Great stuff. Another one I wish I could give 4.5 stars to.
B004G600A4|5.0|The previews didn't give a good impression of this animated film.  Disney did it right this time, going back to the basics.  The movie has a nice amount of magic and a great villian.  They stuck close to the original story and used classic, timeless songs (not modernizing using rock/rap).  Also, I had no worries about the influence it had on my child like I have experienced with the Shrek movies (fart/burps/hidden messages).
0765326353|4.0|I'm exceptionally impressed with the vision of this book. Sanderson has a knack for invention, whether magic systems, or societies. I know he's a hopeless geek with things like Magic the Gathering and whatnot. I think his closeness to unique magic attacks through such games have fueled some of this creativity.    Regardless, this book is a massive volume in an ambitious undertaking. Sanderson really focuses in on a few characters to provide a depth that might otherwise be lacking. At the same time, there's an expansiveness to the world that might be described as breadth. Quite an accomplishment, really. I'll be watching for the next installment.     This is epic fantasy! I don't think you can go wrong here.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I got addicted to the original, not so much with seasons, but I looove Rio! I am so addicted to it and can't wait for the additional levels to be released! Graphics are great and game runs smoothly on Droid Incredible.
0553386794|5.0|One of the best fantasy series going. Martin has a gift for dialogue and draws fascinating characters. He's particularly strong with the intrigue elements as they play out between political enemies. There's little doubt this will be one of the series for the ages.<br /><br />There's only occassionally the false note, and it's often so slight that you hardly notice. I'd probably give this 4.5 stars if Amazon had such an option.<br /><br />The magic is underplayed. It's not a problem, but it's an interesting choice for a fantasy novel. But I love the voices of the characters. Truly compelling!
B001ILHY2C|5.0|i just love car racing movies ( i own fast and furious 1-4 all on blue ray of course ) this's my 5th car racing movie. soon will add Speed-movie to my collection. now about death race: the sound with 5.1 HTS-HD is nice but would be better with 7.1 format ( currently running 7.1 set HT ) the pitchure are great, clear and smooth specially during race scences. it's action packed and it's difinitely MAN's movie with beautiful chicks, machine gun blazing and it even have a story to boost. i love this movie when first saw it in the theatre with my buddy. 5 stars all around:)    ken69
B002ZG993Q|1.0|This is the most unthrilling thriller I have ever seen. By the end of the movie I could not have cared less for any of the characters, and the ending was completely unsurprising as well.  Have I mentioned how very boring it was?
B000035Z3K|5.0|I bought this and had it sent to a young friend who loves classic vampire movies.  She had specifically requested this one.  Yeah---she like it---of course :-)
B00003CX8U|5.0|What constitutes a good full life? Who decides? To be on the wire is life. The rest is waiting. If your not into the Broadway element understand this film goes much much deeper then that. Its about life and art. Living for creativity. You will not be able to sit still through this entire movie because you will actually want to sing and dance. And after the end, the grand finally you will be moved, and most likely ready to live. Showtime!
B000NQRR1Q|3.0|I bought this movie to add to my Johnny Depp and Frank Langella collections.  It's been a long time since I've watched this movie, but if memory serves me right---it's not that great.  I haven't had a chance to watch it since I bought this---so don't know.  Like I said, I bought it for my collection.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|This CD is downright boring. I am a huge Josh Groban fan and was really looking forward to listening to Illuminations. With all of the beautiful songs out there, I can't imagine why these 13 songs were selected. They are almost odd - strangely arranged and impossible to remember or sing along with. JG's voice is incredible but his talents are wasted on this CD.
B0002KVULG|5.0|I bought this and had it sent to a young friend who loves classic vampire movies.  I used to have it on VHS myself and I watched it so many times the tape nearly wore out. Frank Langella is the best Vampire--ever. He is so sexy.  Beautiful scenery---it's just all good.  And my young friend said she throughly enjoyed it.
0316069353|5.0|With the recession, fewer and fewer of LA's crooks can afford a lawyer for the defense. The legal growth industry is home foreclosure defense. So Mickey Haller (\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\") morphs into a foreclosure lawyer.<br /><br />Circumstances take an abrupt turn and Mickey shifts from a foreclosure attorney back to a murder defense when his client is accused of murdering the banker who has taken away her home.<br /><br />Mickey is crafty, cynical, some might say sleazy---but tireless, fearless and ruthless in fighting for his clients.<br /><br />Nuisance that she is, Haller suspects his client may actually be innocent.<br /><br />The prosecutor is a worthy opponent, a sharp and dangerous deputy DA on the rise.<br /><br />It turns out the murdered banker was involved with organized crime while attempting to bail out his underwater properties. The possibility exists someone else was not pleased with the victim's activities...a chance for reasonable doubt.<br /><br />From set-up to accusation to trial prep to the trial and on to the verdict, Michael Connelly once again shows his mastery of suspense. The plot is loaded with energy and surprise. As usual, the clues are hidden in plain sight. The twists and turns do not stop when the trial is concluded. The ending Connelly augured all along nevertheless comes across as unforeseen and satisfying.<br /><br />Every sentence in a Connelly novel is important. There are no wasted words. Skim and scan at your own peril.
B004478GNI|5.0|My son says that this LEGO is \\"an amazing toy to play with because of the ship and characters.  It comes with a new characters (R2Q2 and the Imperial Pilot).  It's wings can go up and down.\\"
B000ZLFALI|4.0|This was a very emotional type of film, one that I think most women could get into easily, but it is all kind of off in a way that is difficult to explain. I would not rebuy this film because I just have a hard time getting through all the superfluous crap in the film to get to the actualy story, and the actualy story itself is lacking in depth anyway. Its like the film was created for the sole purpose of stretching CG's muscles infront of an audience. The movie leaves you wanting.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|I have been a fan of the original 1982 TRON since I was a kid. Both my parents worked in the satellite and computer field, and, at its heart, TRON is about a Kevin Flynn's journey into a fantastical world, albeit one of circuits and bits. This being said, it's my kind of movie, dated technology and all, and there is no way for me to go into seeing TRON: Legacy without a biased perspective.<br /><br />The initial idea of a sequel, followed by the first teaser trailer released looked fabulous; I pounced on it and couldn't stop thinking about it from the moment I saw it. I was so impressed with how they managed to get such a wonderful blend of the old school style from the original, mixed with the modern sensibilities of our current computer age. When I first saw the newly-designed Recognizer float down out of the sky, my heart skipped several beats. The numerous articles written about the film implied an incredible amount of work having gone into making the film and the extended trailers continued to look just as amazing as the first; even better.<br /><br />And on that note, I suppose, the film managed to deliver. The look of the film is, by far, its strongest quality (except, perhaps, for Daft Punk's ingenious musical score). The story,  however, leaves something to be desired. Several somethings<br /><br />When I first viewed the film, I was left feeling deflated and slightly heartbroken. The ending pushed all the film's other pros aside; I wasn't sure if I'd ever see it again, even for the visuals.<br /><br />I have, however, gone back and seen it twice since. I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing, but I'm still left disappointed by the time the end credits roll.<br /><br />Visually, it was everything I could have hoped for, dreamed of, ever thought possible. Absolutely fantastic. It was beyond amazing to see those images, those concepts come to life in ways that the original couldn't, because of the restrictions in technology and filmmaking of the time. Still, the original film set those ideas in motion and to see them executed in the ways that Legacy was able to do was a dream come true. The Light Cycles, the Disc Games and, again, for me, personally, the eloquent appearance and flight of the Recognizers.<br /><br />But for all the effort the filmmakers supposedly put into the screenplay, it doesn't seem to be there. The story is clich&eacute;, predictable, and, at times, paradoxically over-achieving.  The film is an \\"Alice in wonderland\\" type plot, it didn't need the earth-shattering subplot of the miraculous new life form.  Going into the computer and finding a living,  breathing world was earth-shattering enough and could have been, all on its own, in this sequel, from the perspective of Sam Flynn, Kevin's son. The religious subtext, too, was unnecessary.  Not wholly inappropriate (since any artist can relate to the idea of one's ideas and creations becoming their own entities) but sometimes it felt almost preachy (\\"there, standing over me, was the Creator...\\" and, \\"behold! the son of our Maker!\\"). They could have played with these ideals in a different way, more the way they did in the original film, with this debate of whether or not the Users are real, or if that predetermines them to a specific life or fate (a theme right out of Alice Through the Looking Glass).<br /><br />There's no mention whatsoever of who Kevin Flynn married, or what happened to Laura and/or Yuri (the female programmer and program from the first film, played by Cindy Morgan).<br /><br />I also feel that, by having Flynn get stuck inside the Grid in the 1980's, it restricted the story from utilizing any of the concepts or developments that have come along in the last 22 years (since the film's opening in 1989). What was the point of updating the story to modern times, then? Plus, the original Grid was not a \\"world,\\" with buildings, restaurants, etc., nor was there a game called TRON; Tron was the program, not a game. The game was called Space Paranoids. I realize that it's an adaptation for the new film, for a new generation, but they never really explain what this TRON game is; every bit of the \\"Tron Game\\" that we saw were Light Cycles and Disc Wars; so what is it? And what was the point? Too, the very idea of Light Cycles, Disc Battles, Recognizers, etc., didn't necessarily make sense. Why would Clu 2.0 have reinvented these things, exactly as they were before?<br /><br />But my biggest gripe with the film, as I've mentioned, is the way they chose to end it, and here's why.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />My favorite character in the TRON universe is Tron himself. He's my favorite part of the original film; him and Flynn meeting and taking down the Master Control Program together. But Tron, the character, was one of the things I loved most about the film and the story; I liked how he resembles Alan, but they're really two different characters (which I thought was impressive from an acting standpoint on the part of Bruce Boxleitner, who played both roles). My expectation for the new film, given the publicity surrounding it, was that Tron was going to either be completely ignored or only included as a bit part, without much involvement. After all, the trailers, commercials, posters, etc., don't even MENTION him at all, despite the title of the film itself. I thought, on a more specific note, that Tron would have been killed or buried or something, and that the mission would involve - at least partly - finding him (along with Flynn) and bringing him back to life, which, given how the film went, I would much rather have seen; it would have been a more interesting story. Hell, they could have gone with a \\"King Arthur\\" sort of subtext and it would have worked.<br /><br />In a way, that's sort of what happened, though. Clu re-programs Tron to become a faceless, evil henchman, complete with the red-coloring and a helmet that hides his face. They tried to fool the audience by not telling you until much later in the film that that's who Tron is, but it's incredibly easy to figure out pretty early on. At least I wondered if it was him almost as soon as I saw him. I was looking for him, though; almost as soon as Sam Flynn entered the computer universe I was thinking, where's Tron? Where's Tron? I wonder if that's Tron... So I picked up on it pretty quickly. We get to see Tron's face in flashbacks; a young Bruce Boxleitner's face, via the same tech used to make a young Jeff Bridges' face for young Kevin Flynn and Clu. And it's pretty amazing, honestly. It really was Tron. (Likely, in part, because Boxleitner aged really well.) But you never see his face again, throughout the rest of the film. That bothered me. I kept waiting for him to take a more active role. He's just been re-programed; brainwashed so to speak, and it seemed off, a cheap way to have him involved. Knowing the back-story from the original, too, I find it a little hard to believe that Clu could just simply overtake Tron. Tron was the bigger program, with a specific purpose, more suited to take out threats than Clu; he was written as a security program by Alan, after all.<br /><br />At the end of the film, Tron \\"pulls Darth Vader.\\" They're all in the middle of this air battle, and Tron's coming after them, as he's done the whole movie as Clu's top henchman. But Flynn makes eye contact with him (through the helmet, I'm guessing) and just says his name, \\"Tron...\\" and Tron, still decked in the red coloring, seems to recall his own memory of the flashback we saw earlier, when he said, \\"Flynn, go!\\" as he was fighting off Clu and his cronies. He shakes his head, but then seems to have a full change of heart and turns his vehicle to intersect with Clu's. Just before he throws the vehicle forward for impact, we hear him say, \\"I fight for the Users.\\" It's a classic line from the original, and I loved hearing it, but as they crashed, and both Tron and Clu went spiraling down into the Sea, I was horrified, thinking that Tron had gotten the axe for good. Then they showed him falling in the sea, and his suit returns to the blue tones. And that, boys and girls, is the last we see of him in the film.<br /><br />The real killer thing, though, is that, on top of already having lost Tron at that point, Flynn defeats Clu by merging to two of them together and causing a massive explosion throughout the Grid, destroying everything - including himself - while Sam and Quorra escape back through the portal, into our world.<br /><br />It just seemed cruel and unnecessary, to lose them both. I would have rather have seen Sam get stuck there than Kevin. I realize that it's largely due to the filmmakers' attempting to bring the whole of the story into a modern context, to a new audience, to the younger generation, but, at the same time, it's just completely heart wrenching for anyone who has followed the original and loved it for years. Honestly, I don't care about Sam and Quorra. The film did not manage to successfully create new characters that match the originals. I thought that Olivia Wilde's performance was enjoyable and thorough, but I was not especially impressed with Garrett Hedlund. The last few minutes of the movie, all about them, just seemed useless. I respected the fact that they didn't have some big, romantic kissing scene at the end, but otherwise, I just didn't care what happened to them. The two cornerstones of the story, the universe, were gone.<br /><br />Again, it just seems that, considering the title is TRON, he, as a character, gets terribly underplayed in this film; so under-appreciated and often flat-out ignored. That makes me sad, because, as I said, he's my favorite character and I wanted to see him around more. I think his participation in the story as a hero would have actually helped the newer audiences fully understand WHY the thing is called TRON to begin with.<br /><br />I have heard the various theories floating around regarding the supposed third film that is being planned; i.e. that the whole system will be examined with a fine-tooth comb and that the mission will be to help bring Flynn back to life, along with Tron. One of my friends even predicted that, next time, Alan may have to go back in with Sam. If they chose to follow that route, then I'm all for it, because, in that case, maybe Tron and Alan will come face to face. They communicate in the original film, but only Tron experiences it as a conversation; to Alan, it's just a command code or mission. So if they actually met in person, like Clu and Flynn did in this one, how AMAZING would that be?<br /><br />As a writer, filmmaker and a fan, all I really care about is bringing back Flynn and Tron. Save them. Save Tron, save the world.ly on. At least I wondered if it was him almost as soon as I saw him.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|I am definitely NOT a Beatles fan, but that just speaks all the more of how amazing this soundtrack is. I don't care for the film much, but I can't get enough of the music. I've never heard Beatles tunes so seductively remastered before.
B00275EHJG|3.0|The film struck me in a way I didn't expect. Quite frankly, it deals with themes much deeper than a kid growing up. The whole of the movie - and the final scene in particular - tackle the concepts of loss, separation and one's own self worth. For me, personally, it brought up issues of death and grief, the idea of never seeing someone you care about ever again. It makes me wince to recall the images of the baby doll (\\"Big Baby\\") left outside in the rain; walking away sadly, animated in a way that was so life-like, it seems too real.<br /><br />The movie wrung me out, physically drained and emotionally exhausted.<br /><br />It's hard for me to tell whether or not I actually liked the film. I wasn't as blown away as I expected to be - apart from the heart-twisting ending. I had hoped that the villain would have been a bit more different from the Prospector of Toy Story 2. I was aware going in that they didn't \\"die\\" in the landfill, so the sequence in which they all are headed for the fiery furnace didn't have much of an impact. I did feel the use of 3D in this movie and it left me a little disappointed. Even Pixar has succumbed to it, sadly. Granted, it wasn't nearly as bad as some other films have been.<br /><br />I know that I should probably see it again, but I'm not entirely sure I can. Or want to. It hit very close to home and I'm not sure I want to be that emotionally raw or depressed again anytime soon.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I thought the Pixar short film before the movie, \\"Night and Day,\\" was absolutely fantastic. One of their best. I applaud it and it's cleverness, of uniquely combing hand-drawn animation with the CG animation. Brilliant.
0670022411|2.0|I was really excited to read this book after all the great reviews, including one in Entertainment magazine. And I'm not sure they read the same book I did! I read all different genres - fantasy, historical fiction/non-fiction, mystery/thriller, romance...and this book was just BORING. I may be more critical because I went into the book thinking it was going to be fantastic (based on the magazine/newspaper reviews) and it was just okay.   The story was tedious and about 200 pages too long...especially considering that not much happened! I wonder if this author has ever read a romance novel? I wasn't feeling it from the two main characters at all, and I find it hard to believe that a 1500 year-old vampire can suffer from love at first sight! Maybe it WAS destiny, but at least humor the audience a little first. One doesn't have to put graphic love scenes in a book to make it romantic (and don't look for any here, cause there are none), but the two main characters' love story is the backbone for the trilogy...so please give the reader something to make it believable! It took me about two weeks to read this book, and if it was more exciting it might have taken me about 2-3 days. As other reviewers have said, the ending obviously leaves us hanging to find out what happens in the next installment. I don't know if I really care, and I'm very glad I did not pay full-price for this book. Was it one of the worst books I've ever read - not at all. Would I recommend it to anyone - no.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|Short version: BBC's \\"Sherlock\\" is WAY better.<br /><br />As far as this film goes, I had the same reaction to it that I had to \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\\"  I say that in the mindset that I am a solid Harry Potter fan as well as a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories of the famous detective.  Guy Ritchie and his team had a clear and justifiable direction in which they wanted to take the film; they claimed to want to tell a grittier, more action-oriented story, with suspense that actually pulled you into the action, rather than simply observing it from afar.  He claimed to do so by eliminating the many stereotypes associated with Holmes and his adventures on 221B Baker Street.  Or, rather, take things back to before those stereotypes  formed.  Ritchie's intentions were honorable and, in some parts of the movie, they worked wonderfully.  In others, however, they didn't.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, the good was very good and the bad was very bad. The overall character of Holmes, played by Robert Downey Jr., was believable, right down to his mannerisms and accent. Meanwhile, I marveled at the entire character development of Irene Addler. They turned her into a full-blown criminal and modern-minded woman, rather than the sophisticated woman she really was in Doyle's book.  Yes, I say that book, singular, on purpose. Addler only appeared in one short story; and, in that short story, she and Holmes were NOT in love, nor was it ever implied.  She merely bested him at his own game - the only person, let alone woman to do it - and he respected her for it, which is significant since Holmes did not respect women in general.<br /><br />On another side of the playing field, the production design was fabulous, while their use of anachronistic devices was staggering, from the misuse of the phrase \\"down the rabbit hole,\\" to the extravagant (often unnecessary) fight sequences.  The writing was well-written for the most part, as far as dialogue went, and yet I did not care for all the mystical, voodoo, magical...stuff they used in the story. It set the wrong tone as far as I was concerned, a tone too different from that of the books. And yet, in and of itself, it worked cohesively. I just didn't like it much.<br /><br />However, the fact that they introduce Professor Moriarty at the end of the film leaves me far more interested in the inevitable sequel than I had in this, first, film.

It set the wrong tone as far as I was concerned, a tone too different from that of the books. And yet, in and of itself, it worked cohesively. I just didn't like it much.    However, the fact that they introduce Professor Moriarty at the end of the film leaves me far more interested in the inevitable sequel than I had in this, first, film.

B0042EJD8A|4.0|The documentary is very informative and I used it for teaching both Undergraduate and Postgraduate students about issues with coal seam gas - similar to what is currently being experienced in Australia. Parts of it were a bit long winded but overall interesting and timely.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I was thoroughly impressed by this film.  I'm surprised it didn't get more attention from the Academy.  I heard about it through my beloved EMPIRE magazine, and I'd seen it in other various entertainment magazines, praising the likes of Keira Knightley, Andrew Garfield (post Social Network) and Carey Mulligan.  And they deserve every word of credit; they give wonderful performances (the best I've seen from Knightley in a long while), the cinematography is stunning and the writing is superb.<br /><br />The subject matter is directly addressed only once in the entire film and yet the level of intensity and heartbreak expressed throughout is astounding.<br /><br />It's a film for which you definitely have to brace yourself, but it is well worth watching.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This is a great television show. Even useable in Europe because of the English subtitles. And I didn't had any problems with the US code 1.
B003UESJF6|3.0|I don't especially care for Will Ferrell's humor. In fact, I go out of my way to tell people that I spell my last name differently than he does (Farrell/Ferrell). I'm not entirely sure why I dislike his acting and comedy so much; I just don't. I was underwhelmed by his performance in Stranger Than Fiction, though I respected the attempt at a more serious role (of course, he hasn't done anything even remotely similar since), but, on the whole, I tend to avoid his comedy/acting...the man entirely.<br /><br />That being said, I honestly never thought that I would see a movie in which I empathize and sincerely care about a character voiced by him.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for Megamind, I was immediately interested, before I knew who was providing the voice for the title character. Upon finding out, I was taken aback, since the movie seemed different from his usual faire; not so much his traditional humor, though the repeated lines about \\"unbelievably handsome\\" seemed a little rich and midly annoying within a 1 minute teaser trailer. Still, I was optimistic about the casting choice (encouraged by Tina Fey's involvement) and looked forward to seeing the movie. The concept was interesting, the characters amusing and fun.<br /><br />Now, though it took me two viewings, I've come to the conclusion that I do, genuinely, like the film, in spite of Ferrell and in spite of the film's many and distinctive flaws.<br /><br />As far as positives go, the film was surprisingly sweet and adorable.  There were several remarkable moments that stood out, pure gems - much like ones in How to Train Your Dragon. They came off the screen and touched you, emotionally...even in plain, ol' 2D. I didn't expect that from a kids' comedy that's supposedly poking fun at superheroes and comic book canon. I wasn't at all prepared for a romantic sub-plot or an underlying theme about the desire for acceptance and companionship, about fitting in and just trying to belong. In one specific scene in the beginning, there's a brief moment where we see a photograph of Megamind's class, where he and his Minion are standing entirely separate from the rest of the group, off to the side. In spite of that isolation, both of them wear smiles. In that one instant, you completely sympathize. It took me right back to my early school days and how very tough a time it could be. And I certainly didn't have a giant blue head, cause accidental disasters, or live in a prison.<br /><br />On a more cheerful note, I enjoyed tremendously the motifs the film played with; not just the superhero-stuff, but the clash of musical styles. I loved that Metro Man is, essentially, Elvis (even down to the joke that he's still alive somewhere), and that Megamind is sort of a personification of classic rock, complete with the black leather and silver spikes. They are both extremely theatrical, but in entirely different ways. But the superher0 references and puns are, without a doubt, a great deal of fun and wholeheartedly amusing.<br /><br />It has to be said, too, that a sure-fire way to impress me is for a film that's released in 3-D to be completely enjoyable in 2-D. Megamind did. There are some scenes here and there where it's clear the filmmakers played around with the device, sure, but it managed to still be subtle about it.  A million brownie points earned. That's two films in a row - keep it up, Dreamworks.<br /><br />On the other hand, the film is NOT without it's problems. While the heart of the movie lies in the characters, specifically Megamind's inner yearning to belong and be normal, the film more bluntly pushes the idea of \\"destiny\\" and \\"what makes you who you are.\\" It comes across as conflicting, almost confusing, as though you have to switch back and forth between two themes. The ideal situation would be that they compliment each other and that one, ultimately, stands over the other, but they honestly seem to be side-by-side and it's frustrating; it made the film seem disjointed in places, rather than cohesive. I think a bit more time in story development would have done the film a lot of good. Not to mention some re-writes on the often clich&eacute; dialogue.<br /><br />It comes back to a fundamental difference between Dreamworks and Pixar.  People often tell me that they can't keep the two studios' work straight, as far as which released which films. To me, it's ridiculously blatant. While both studios are brilliant when it comes to the quality of the animation itself, Dreamworks tends to rely more on humor, gags and antics, whereas Pixar's films dig deeper and really flesh out their themes, characters and emotional core. \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" was the first time I saw Dreamworks really compare to the likes of \\"Toy Story,\\"\\" \\"Monsters' Inc.,\\" or \\"Up.\\" I'm not sure that \\"Megamind\\" did. It had all the potential in the world - it had all the right pieces, but they didn't fit together properly - not the way they could have, anyway - and it shows. It's like... \\"the little movie that could've.\\"<br /><br />In the end, though, apart from a slightly weak ending, the film was fun, enjoyable and surprisingly sweet and endearing. Will Ferrell somehow managed to not be obnoxious to those of us who usually can't stand him, and I'm sure his fans will be quite pleased with his performance. As I said after I saw him in \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" I respected the gamble and had hoped to see him take on similar roles in the future (though steer clear of things like my beloved \\"Bewitched\\"). It would seem that this go-round was much better than anything thus far, at least in my humble opinion. Here's hoping he continues in this direction.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, but as long as you go in with an open mind.<br /><br />Get it?ore time in story development would have done the film a lot of good.

B004SQS9FA|2.0|I have loved Radiohead since The Bends came out and this album is just horrible. It sounds like they all took acid and listened to the Grateful Dead for a year and made an album.  So disappointing.  Sometimes I need to listen to their albums 3 or 4 times before it sinks in but I couldn't even listen to this a 3rd time. There are a couple songs that are OK but overall this is just drivel. I'm glad I didn't waste (no pun intended) my money on the Vinyl and CD package.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I want to make it clear that, on the whole, the film itself was, I think, a success.  I think it may be one of, if not the best film in the franchise thus far.<br /><br />The choice to split the final story into two parts paid off; the details, nuances that cropped up throughout the film were all possible because the film had time to work them in.  Even things that might have escaped the notice of people who didn't read the books, they're there for those of us who did (i.e. Hermione's reference to perfume; the perfume Ron gave her for her birthday).  I also firmly believe that the kids, the stars (Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Felton, etc.) have never given better performances.  They clearly handled this film (and, likely, its companion due out next year) with extreme care.  It shows, and I, for one, am grateful.<br /><br />I've heard several reviews that say the film is laden down with too much plot, too many devices, details and new information, but that's hardly its own fault; the book presents all of those things originally.  Yes, the book had more pages than the film has screen time, but considering how much the book introduces here in the home stretch, how many new things have to be incorporated and made known, it seemed to work well.  Things got cut, and things got altered, but in ways that worked and, in the end, leaves us with a film that is gripping and heartfelt.<br /><br />My full review (with my takes on the good, the bad and the ugly) can be found here: [...]
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|I'm so happy I bought this. It was cheaper online than at Hot Topic, so it was already a good buy. This is Green Day's second official live DVD, and it really is awesome! There isn't much between each song, like with Bullet In a Bible, not like Green Day exploring Tokyo or anything :/ It would have been really nice. As for the audio CD, I was quite surprised to see that they put tracks I've never heard them sing live, like J.A.R and Going to Pasalaqua (?). It is really different from Bullet In a Bible, but I still really enjoyed it. :D Any Green Day fan would LOVE it &lt;3
B004R63MWQ|4.0|Tron: Legacy was a pleasure to watch and was a great tribute to the depth of the original story. Many of the science fiction movies of today sacrifice story to include more CGI. Special effects supported the story. The story dovetailed nicely into the original and all of the characters felt real. Well done!

B002ZG98UA|4.0|Milli Jovovich is a great actress and it is nice to see another Resident evil.  These epic movie's are one's you would never grow tired of seeing.  Afterlife is another classic Resident Evil movie it's slow in places and slightly different from the first three, but still it is a classic that will servive the length of time and each generation will enjoy these movies.  Besides having some great actors in it who would pass up the oppitunity to watch Wentworth Miller or Ali Larter on the big screen with Milli Jovovich, it's fast it's gory and it's true to all Resident evil movies.  It's a must see.

B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|So, let me start my review by saying the music was Perfect for the movie & just Awesome!  The acting of Saoirse Ronan was very good! She fit her Character very well in this movie.  Her Character seems to go through a lot to meet her goals...  Cate Blanchett did a great job as well in her role as the bad girl...    The action sequences were good & very believable!! Unlike a lot of movies where the cgi takes over & turns scenes into more of a circus show...    The only Con to the movie is though the action was good, there wasn't enough action in the movie.  They could have easily including more action sequences within the movie..  This movie was entertaining & the theater crowd were all watching intently throughout the entire 2 hours!    I give this movie an A-  I hope they have sequel & believe they could easily do that...  I would recommend going to see it on the Big Screen!    Thanks for reading my review!

B004KPLVW2|5.0|I never saw TRON when it was released in theaters. That summer E.T. was the big film to see so TRON went ignored. I would first see it on VHS. The video's blury 4:3 transfer didn't do the film justice. Years later I saw it on Laserdisc. The picture was much better, but still failed to reproduce the amount of detail the film had theatrically. Up until this weeks blu ray release, the best version of the film was the 20th Anniverary 2 Disc DVD. It was the first true 16:9 transfer of the film for home video. It was the closest I've been to seeing TRON projected and one of my favorite DVDs. But as beautiful as the DVD is, the blu ray puts it to shame. I played both discs side by side and the blu ray looks like a brand new film. Colors are brighter. Details are clearer. The biggest improvement is how clean it looks. The DVD has alot of noticable dirt in several scenes. The blu ray has none. Watching the remastered BD has finally given me the feeling of seeing the film in it's theatrical presentation     As far as the film itself, I've always loved it. Anyone reading this has probably seen TRON by now so I won't rehash the plot. All I will say about the film is that the story and look were ahead of it's time. Much of the plot and dialogue went over my head when I first saw it. But as technology has progressed and become much more common, TRON became more and more understandable. I'm still amazed that Disney took such a gamble on what was such a radical story. What's even more amazing is that TRON was snubbed by the Academy for \\"cheating\\" using computers for the visual effects. When you realize what the film makers went through to create the visual effects, you'll demand a Oscar for what they went through. Using computers to do visual effects in 1982 was like drawing a comic book blind folded and having to re-draw panel after panel til you got it right. It wasn't the streamlined process it is today.     For any fan of TRON it's a no-brainer that you purchase this blu ray. If you haven't upgraded to the format, this should be your first disc.

B004DK5CYM|2.0|The title about says it all: the Disney-fication of the story of a great horse is no competition for the excellent movie \\"Sea Biscuit\\". It was as I feared it would be: a production by the Walt Disney factory with pretty horses, wan and wimpy humans, and a story that seemed not to know where it wanted to go. No competition to the hearty, well-told (even with flaws), beautifully and strongly photographed tale of the little horse that could. Another flabby reworked story from Disney... too bad, it could have been a great movie. The bones were there, but no meat. How sad!

B002ZG975Q|2.0|I can't say the remix did it a lot of good. The story gets off to a shallow start, with pretty much every character acting out some stereotype. Kyle places himself squarely in a cult of personality (his), at the expense of everything that matters. Lindy (charmingly played by Vanessa Hudgens) is the earnest one, working her way up from an unfortunate start - almost a Horatio Alger character, or a character from one of those nineteenth century class-consciousness novels. One of the Olsen sisters showed up in goth drag, playing the part of the witch.<br /><br />After that, the classic Beauty/Beast story plays itself out predictably: fair maiden held in isolation with The Beast, he trying desperately to break the enchantment. How this happens in modern-day New York (or something similar) stretches credulity, but I'll go along with that much for the sake of the story. The only real additions to the old fairy tale are Kyle's father - as obnoxious as Kyle, but more practiced - and his tutor, who probably shouldn't make me think of Pinocchio's Jiminy Cricket but does.<br /><br />In the utterly predictable happy ending, true love blossoms. Or, I wonder, was it just Stockholm Syndrome?<br /><br />Outstanding, if you're a high schooler looking for a shallow, romantic date movie - but I'm not.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|It takes a courageous soul to fight back when tragedy strikes, and Bethany Hamilton is a true fighter. At the age of thirteen, on the cusp of great things as an aspiring pro surfer, she lost her left arm in a tragic shark attack. Many of us would've given up on our dreams then and there. Bethany didn't. Grounded in her faith and family, her story made the international news in 2003. She even wrote a book about her experience, aptly titled Soul Surfer.<br /><br />Now eight years later the movie of the same name is out and telling even more of her story, including some of Bethany's struggles and doubts after the accident. Starring AnnaSophia Robb as Bethany, Soul Surfer the movie isn't just another beating-the-odds sports flick. It's an incredible and inspiring story of a young girl who triumphed over adversity. Knowing these events really happened makes everything mean more.<br /><br />With a terrific cast giving spot on performances, Soul Surfer exceeded my expecations. Dennis Quaid as Bethany's father shows the depth of his acting skills, believably playing a fun-loving guy one minute, a devestated father ready to fall apart the next. The same is true for Helen Hunt as Bethany's mom, Cheri. In several scenes her deep, motherly emotions were palpable, and yet she hadn't said a word. AnnaSophia Robb gives one of her best performances in this role, every bit as heartfelt as you'd hope. A case could be made that supporting cast member Carrie Underwood as Sarah Hill, Bethany's youth leader, was possibly the weakest link in the acting department. She had the tendency to overact a little in her scenes, but you couldn't help liking her anyway as her character came across genuine and caring.<br /><br />It's fascinating how the filmmakers were able to make it appear as if Robb herself was actually missing an arm. She had to wear a green sleeve during the shooting, holding her arm behind her back, but it's almost eery how realistic it appears. Filmed on location in Hawaii, Hamilton herself was Robb's stunt double for the difficult surfing scenes.<br /><br />There's so much to take away from this story, but what's most refreshing is how the filmmakers didn't water down the Hamiltons' faith. Which isn't to say it's a preachy story; not at all. The message of relying on God and His strength flowed as naturally through the movie as the Hawaiian waves. The love the Hamilton family has for each other is touching. Soul Surfer would be a fantastic movie to watch with your youth group, but all ages will find something to enjoy. This is one you'll want to watch more than once.<br /><br />MPAA Rating: PG - the shark attack scene could be disturbing for young children.<br /><br />--Reviewed by C.J.

B00466HN68|4.0|The premise seems iffy, but I've seen worse: time travel becomes possible, but only a limited sort. Some few people can go back in time to the last eight minutes of another's life. Unfortunately, that includes the event that ended it, so it's hardly a pleasure cruise. Much to no one's surprise, the military takes this technology on as a counter-terrorism tool. It's too late to avert the disaster that already happened, but maybe it contains clues that will help prevent a bigger one. Eight minutes is hardly enough to get started, so Colter Stevens has to take the trip again and again, learning a little more each time, and dying again each time.<br /><br />The action plays well, and plays a little differently in each eight-minute trip (so he can make progress against the terrorist), right to the very end - which contains a pleasant flip. On the whole, this action movie acquits itself much better than lots I can name.<br /><br />So, what's my beef? The name. Obviously, some Lala-lander heard this cool techie term \\"source code\\". He didn't understand what it meant, so assumed that it had no meaning - leaving him free to make one up. I could do that too. Let's let the word \\"scriptwriter\\" refer to a South American turnip, and \\"director\\" be a children's playground toy. See how well that works? Heck, even a movie like [[ASIN:B0011UF79C Gattaca]] had the decency to create a new word when they created a new meaning. Outside that one bit of ridiculosity, I really did enjoy this one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

There were some areas that seemed smoother, but in the end the recording is veiled. For the hype of Gold and the extra money, you should hear a significant up grade. Not Here.  Stevie's other albums all seem to have better fidelity.
0393314804|5.0|My title sums this up.  I found this to be one of the best books I've read in months.  The characters are flawed, but likable, for the most part, and the ending is superb.  It's relatively nonchronological, something that I kind of liked.      I highly recommend.
1416596585|5.0|Among recent great books describing the business and impact of information technology, In the Plex is one of the best.  As impactful as [[ASIN:B004W3GFFU Pulse: The New Science of Harnessing Internet Buzz to Track Threats and Opportunities]], and with story-telling as engaging as [[ASIN:1591843820 Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft]] this book will be on the shortlist of 2011 \\"must reads\\" in the business of technology.    One of my favorite writers, Steven Levy of Wired, gained what may be unprecedented access to the employees and upper management of Google in order explore the history, the work environment key management decisions of one of the most innovative and culturally-influential companies of all time. Google manages this with 24,000 employees who see Google as the perfect employer for them. Levy describes Google as a place for the \\"unspeakably brainy\\", a kind of \\"geek never-never land\\" - just the right kind of environment to maximize innovativeness. Among the perks is the requirement for every engineer to spend a share of their time on personal projects. And as daunting as it sounds, Levy says Co-founder Larry Page actually still signs off on every single hire.     The co-founders Sergey Brin and Page literally started Google from a garage. (The name was a misspelling of the mathematical term for 10 to the 100th power - Googol. But the name stuck.) Their big idea: efficient searches and how to make money at it by selling keywords.  Levy then leads us through Google's history of fantastic growth and innovation focusing mainly on big decisions in the firm. Among them the mistakes of handling the special case of China where media access is more controlled than Google would prefer and where management style of the China-based executives were more like a stodgy, old IBM than the free-thinking Google. The company with the motto \\"Don't be Evil\\", ultimately decided to leave the China market.     The rapid growth of the firm was itself a major challenge. That many smart people with the freedom and resources to chase many ideas could spread themselves thin. Some of the ideas could be technically possible because of the clever solutions Google staff would develop, but some ideas had other obstacles the engineering-oriented firm didn't anticipate. For example, Google's plan to scan in millions of books and offer them online ran into what should have been entirely foreseeable legal obstacles from authors. But as Levy describes in the first pages of the book, \\"To Google, it was a boon to civilization.\\"  It is this story that frames much of the rest of the book: visionary and cash-rich but somewhat naïve technologists struggle with practical realities of the rest of the world.     Some of the employee perks are drying up as economic hard times have even hit Google. The sheer size of the firm has required some amount of long-avoided bureaucracy and rapid acquisitions of firms the engineers thought were cool has slowed down. As Levy says, even the \\"Don't Be Evil\\" motto is now used as ironic humor by Google's detractors.  But Google, with a $180+ billion dollar market capitalization is an example of a massive creation of wealth from one of a few areas where US exports lead the world: world-changing innovation.     Levy's telling of the Google story is based on access no other author had and, as a result, it is the best story about Google written to date.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Its another movie. Your child says 'daddy daddy daddy' so you buy it. After the fact we found it significantly cheaper but who cares, we had it when they said we would, and it works wonderfully, each and every freck'in time they play it. Thanks tons.
0316069353|5.0|I really resent the practice of giving a perfectly good book 1 star because you disagree with the publisher's pricing. An author--and a great one at that--worked for a year to put this out and you're disparaging it with 1 star ratings because of a beef with the publisher? Shame on you! Don't like the Kindle pricing, then don't buy the Kindle book but don't put down the author's work.
B003YOZNBU|2.0|As a comic book fan, this story line had so much potential - wasted on an indifferent cast and endless, redundant and boring fight scenes. The allusion to and demonstrations of Hex's supernatural powers are few and far between, they really become beside the point instead of an interesting focus. Instead of building on the sci-fi action, the director chose lengthy gratuitous violence that added nothing to the plot. One became numb to it after the first few scenes. Hex's dry humor gets lost in this maze of a poor and rambling story line, tedious fighting, and Megan Fox (as a bored as a prostitute) forgets to move her face while speaking her lines.  The film itself deserves one star only, I gave the special effects (which there should have been much more of) another star. This film could have been so good, the fact that it is so bad indicates a level of incompetence that is just stunning and not just a little bit sad.

B0045I3EJC|5.0|It is a mystery to me why this film has not received much attention, because it's one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a beautifully produced, intelligent film about how the choices we make, or don't make, shape our lives.    The soundtrack is perfect and injects some humor to an otherwise serious film. Jared Leto is truly excellent as the main character.     This is film making of the highest quality. If you want something deeper than the usual Hollywood fare, watch this.

B00006674X|4.0|The DVD came quickly in the mail and in excellent condition. This story has a special inspirational tone to it. Service to others. Elvis is a very good actor and this is a stray from the girly shows of yor. If you have early Elvis and yet want more, this is very good. Can you spot Darlene Love? I am not saying MTM is my first choice for the love interest; but it fell down that way. The movie is worth having. It is inpirational~ and we all need that!
B000JQU4TW|1.0|As I ventured into my next classic fiction book, I remembered the movie League of Extraordinary Gentleman.  When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was.  The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character.  When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.<br />This book was not easy to read at all.  It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty.  The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow.  I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time.  It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading.  There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.<br />There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all.  The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book.  Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to.  His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil.  His friend guided him down that path as well.  The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil.  He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.<br />The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.<br /><br />If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments. Check out my profile for the website.y profile for the website.
B00328G4XY|5.0|CD showed up within a week. In perfect condition. Hear the one who everyone copied. He is complex. He dusted off a few delta blues songs added Chicago blues classics, gave it a fresh personal finish and sent them out. Here he took advantage of the electric guitar mastery that he had; to sit on the tippy top of the psychedelic fantasy and love sound. He took moral authority on social issues and philosophies of the day. He looked into the future. It's all here. Beautiful and stylish from the 60's. He was our friend.<br />Particularly like \\"1983 I will be a Mermaid\\"; of course the perfection of \\"Watchtower\\" and unabashedly \\"Voodoo child slight return\\". No reason to get excited....buy it for your listening pleasure. Must like the sound of hard won music.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Exceptional story. Deborah Harkness casts a riveting spell with the story of Diana, the Witch and Mathew, the Vampire.

B004DTLK8A|4.0|Stratovarius were one of those bands that I always thought were cool and had something great musically from the very first time I heard them. When Stratovarius' architect Timo Tolki left the band in 2008 I wondered what would happen of the band, after all it was Tolki's band more than anyone else's. Tolki continued to release music with his R.R. project (which has sadly disbanded) and Strato's remaining members on their end continued their activities with a new guitarist, Matias Kupiainen. The band's first effort since Tolki's departure, Polaris was released in 2009 and saw the band continuing the Stratovarius legacy. Stratovarius's 2011 album, Elysium sees the band in more adventurous territory compared to Polaris. Where Kupiainen was playing it safe and had a sound similar to Tolki, Elysium sees this new lineup of the band developing a slightly different sound and approach to their music. I love the old Stratovarius with Tolki but that doesn't mean that the current formation of the band is a bad one and I love that they're breaking out of the usual formula. As another reviewer pointed out it is not a radical departure, it is still Stratovarius and recognizable as so.<br /><br />Let's go through a few of the songs: Elysium starts off pretty well with the heavy, crunchy and melodic track \\"Darkest Hours\\". Quite a catchy chorus and nice keyboard work reminiscent of 1980's bands, an excellent opener. \\"Under Flaming Skies\\" is a great \\"guitar attack\\" song, a nice breakdown and chorus on this one. \\"Infernal Maze\\" stars out with an attempt to be perhaps over-epic then kicks into a song that can be described as typical Stratovarius, a really enjoyable and solid track. \\"Fairness Justified\\" has great qualities to it, Kotipelto shows a lot of emotion here and the songwriting and progression is top notch. \\"The Game Never Ends\\" is very reminiscent of classic Stratovarius, fast-paced song, double-bass drums, crunchy guitars, high-pitched vocals from Kotipelto and the bands assures us that \\"We never die, never die\\". The album's biggest piece however, is the closing title track \\"Elysium\\" at over 18 minutes in length.I'm not a huge fan of 20 minutes songs, I mean I don't regularly listen to them but they show incredible musicianship(Rush's 2122 is one of those I love for example)and musical talent. \\"Elysium\\" shows Stratovarius at one of their top epic moments and each musician shines through, it is the big talk of the album and rightfully so because it's an amazing track and probably the best song here.<br /><br />I feel that the keyboards have been an important part of the band since the early 1990's have been a bit toned down here. I mean, the keyboards are obviously in Stratovarius' music and they're in it to stay and they are very present here but perhaps not as loud and all over the place as they used to be. Kotipelto doesn't always sing high as he did in the early years of his tenure with the band, he controls his singing like a pro veteran here and uses his voice effectively. What else can I say? Each musician is great at his respective instrument and take pride in it. Timo Tolki is history now but Timo Kotipelto, Jens Johansson, Laurri Porra, Jorg Michael and Matias Kupiainen are moving forward and going strong.<br /><br />I think Elysium is an overall stronger album than Polaris because on this one the new lineup is finding it's voice and is not afraid to do things a bit differently. Polaris was not a bad album by any means but the band played it safe and released something fairly similar to their past work, this time the sound is a little different and I feel that in conclusion it is better. For those who thought the band was past its prime well Stratovarius delivers an excellent performance on Elysium that fans of the band should not miss. No, Tolki is not there but judging from the music here the band is doing fine without him. For what it is Elysium earns a 4/5 stars from me.t \\"We never die, never die\\".

B0039UTDFG|5.0|There are so many reviews on here whining about Oprah Winfrey's narration!  I really prefer her voice over the bbc narrator.  Oprah's voice is a really nice change of pace and I really enjoyed hearing her; oprah's narration does not sound like she's reading from the script.  I expect people just don't like Oprah, which is why they rated this version of the Life series with such negativity.
B00007K02F|1.0|This is the most wretched adaptation of Jane Eyre I've ever seen. It strips away any semblance of love between Jane and Rochester.  Watching this version, it seems like they don't even like each other and its a big mystery as to hy they even would get married or Jane would come back to him.  See the 2006 Masterpiece Theater version - it is 1,000's times better than this nonsense
0525422943|5.0|I was a little late to the game with this series.  Despite everyones recommendation's, I didn't actually get around to reading \\"If I Stay\\" until a couple weeks ago!  I don't know why I put it off for, but I'm so glad that I finally picked it up!!!  It was great!<br /><br />After reading the emotionally charged \\"If I Stay\\" I was afraid that the follow wouldn't be able to live up to the standards the first book set.  My worries were for nothing.  Adam's book, while completely different, was still just as emotionally charged and powerfully written.<br /><br />This tortured, damaged Adam is a much different Adam from the light-hearted romantic that we met in \\"If I Stay\\", but I think I fell even more in love with him with each and every page.  What is it about an emotional damaged bad-boy with a guitar??  Mia, having held him to his promise, has cut him from her life, but in doing so, it seems that it tore his heart out in the process.  Adam is nothing but a shell, and getting through each day for him is a constant struggle.<br /><br />I loved how as Mia and Adam reconnect the book would flash back to things that had happened over the last three years, or things that happened in the past when they were together.  There shared history was always there in the conversations and it made the story very sweet and romantic.<br /><br />As all the different peices of this story start to fall together, and you start to see them as a whole, you realize what a truly beautiful love story this book is.  Mia's and Adam's past, present, and future all collide to make this such a wonderful read.  I love Gayle Forman's writing, and I can't wait to read more by this author!
0316056863|4.0|I bought this book hoping for a few laughs, but I got much more than that. I'll state right up front that I'm a huge Tina Fey fan because of her work on SNL and 30 Rock. So, I was thinking that this book would be a laugh-a-minute. I wasn't totally wrong in this, but it's actually more of a deeper and more insightful look at being a modern working mother.     Fey walks the reader through many anecdotes in her life, including glimpses at her parents and her childhood in Philadelphia. I'm roughly the same age as Fey, so a lot of her coming-of-age stories really resonated with me. These parts also lent interesting insights into how Fey ultimately followed the path that she chose.     The surprise for me, however, was the deeper excavations in this book regarding her feelings about being a working mother. Bottom line: even when you have a job you love, it's really, really freaking hard. Again, this resonated with me, and I found it utterly refreshing (and almost a relief, actually) that Fey was completely open and honest about the challenges related to this issue. She is self-deprecating and doesn't put on airs about how she's got it all under control all the time.     This book is a bit shorter than it might appear due to spacing and the inclusion of photos and other items, but I didn't feel ripped off. Instead I found myself looking forward to her next book. Strong recommend for all readers, but I think working mothers will especially appreciate it.
B004LUS390|4.0|The app itself works great, its the best sketchbook app you will find on either ios or Android.  There are many features, brush types and customization options, but unless you are using a tablet, it is pretty difficult to use.  Once again, this is not because of the app, the app makes it as easy as possible to draw/paint on a phone... but that isn't really saying much.  Unless you are able to find a precise stylus to use with your phone, its hard to have much control with your finger tip or the styli commonly found for touch screen devices.    It is not impossible to be able to use this app well, it just takes a little bit of practice.  It is the best app for drawing or painting, and its only a buck, so its definitely worth the buy if you think you will use it.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brilliantly Brian.....everything you'd expect from a genius of American popular music.  I'm on my second listen to this album and it gets better.  What I particularly like are the simple vocal arrangements of classic Gershwin songs, combined with the 'Wilson Touch\\", that combination of instrumental arrangements and the harmonies that we've grown to love over the years.  Buy this, I guarantee you'll enjoy it for a long time to come.  Brian, congrats on another winner.    Bob H
B000F9RB8K|5.0|I've had LOTF in my collection for many years but for some reason was not drawn into it.   That has changed following my recent viewing of its bluray incarnation, which is magnificent..and which helped entice me to follow its characters and plotline until I was hooked.     If you've had similar feelings to mine about this film you might  want to try again in its bluRay reincarnation.

0316069353|5.0|Mickey Haller, the plaintiff lawyer working out of his Lincoln, finds himself in tough times. He has a new line of legal work (foreclosures) that are keeping him out of debt. His team, however, gets a murder case that involves a foreclosure.....all is not what it seems.     Haller takes the case and his team works hard to find the \\"holes\\" in the state argument that she indeed killed the mortgage banker. Did she? I will not review the book too thoroughly (others do that and do it well), but this is Connelly at his best. The courtroom drama, the shady characters, the \\"justice\\" system and the twists and turns it can take in a courtroom (and outside a courtroom) make this a great read. Nothing is black and white in the world of law and Connelly proves this point over and over in his books whether it is the tough plaintiff lawyer, Mickey Haller, or the great LAPD Harry Bosch.    Get this book. Read this book. Enjoy this book.     One additional note. I go to AMAZON to review this book. I see \\"1 star\\" ratings then I realize it's complaints about KINDLE pricing. AMAZON needs to separate the \\"KINDLE\\" price complaints into another section of the reviews. It warps the ratings of books (see this book as an example) and those who complain about the KINDLE pricing (and I have a KINDLE) complain too much about an issue that they can't do anything about.

0143039881|2.0|Hannah Arendt is without question one of the premier political philosophers of the twentieth century. However in this account of the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem she failed miserably. She failed as a reporter, and even more importantly she failed in moral judgment. She painted a misleading portrait of Eichmann as banal clerk, pathetic ineffectual nothing. But in fact he was an embodiment of human evil. Deborah Lipstadt's recent retelling of the Eichmann trial, and the new evidence relating to what Eichmann actually thought and said at the trial show that he was a calculating deceptive monster whose intention was total extermination of the Jewish people. At the trial he was out to save his life, and so worked to present a false picture of himself.<br />Arendt failed in another area of her study. She in her high- culture arrogance and contempuous attitude toward the leaders of the Jewish councils in Europe- all of whom had completely impossible tasks- i.e. trying to save some portion of the people while dealing with those determined to exterminate them all- showed her own failure in human sympathy.<br />It is painful and ironic that Arendt who so stressed in her writing the faculty of moral judgment showed such a complete absence of moral judgment in writing this work. This work is of a piece with another shameful side of her history. i.e Her pivotal role in rehabilataing the image of her mentor and former lover Heidegger who both identified and acted as a Nazi in the German university world. These two failures of moral judgment put a tremendous stain on her reputation.<br />One more point about her contempt. She showed great contempt for Israel's first Prime Minister and great founding- father Ben - Gurion. She claimed he was making it a 'show- trial'. But before this 'show- trial' the Western world was largely indifferent to the horror of the Shoah. One accomplishment of  this trial did was to make humanity more aware of its own capacity for Evil and Destruction.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I am living proof that you don't have to be under 30 to enjoy this show. I am...well, a bit older than 30, and I am a Major fan. Even my mother, who has been retired for several years, loves it. The characters are likable and intriguing, the acting is top-notch, the story lines are never boring, and it always keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love it. So when I found the entire first season for such a reasonable price, I couldn't pass it up! If you are looking for something fun, a little scary, a little sexy, and seriously addictive, I strongly recommend Vampire Diaries!
B004U8VWLE|4.0|N.P. did a good job and made it very convincing that she believed all the crazy...I was believing it myself. I was watching the movie telling myself she was going to mess up on stage because she is loosing her mind.  Ok, so maybe she did fall on her face once.  I just kept thinking that she was going to stop and yell at the audience.  After watching her mother go a little psycho, I thought poor thing never had a chance.  I then started thinking if she had someone, well anyone in her life that was more normal, maybe she would not have gone so far.  In the end, the flash and fire in her eyes when she let the crazy take over made her performance on the stage perfect.  So, N.P. made it real.
B004QYZATW|5.0|Astoundingly, this movie had a delightful plot, was well acted, and kept my attention for the full length of the film.  A rare feat in Hollywood fare nowadays.  While not a Jolie fan, I am a Depp fan, and this movie accentuated his strengths.  Jolie was Audrey Hepburn-esque, and truly exuded class.    I'm no movie reviewer (obviously), but it's fairly clear to me that any negative critic reviews must have been rooted in sour grapes or behind-the-scenes politics because this film is actually one to watch.  I can see why the Academy nominated it for Best Film, and I'm glad they did.    I think I'll go watch it again to pick up on some clues I may have missed the first time through.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Soul Surfer is a very inspirational movie.  It really captures the spirit and deternination of teenager Bethany Hamilton.  The message of this movie is that faith in God gives a person strength to overcome any obstacle.  I am not overally religious, but I think that faith in a higher power is a positive message.  AnnaSophia Robb gives an excellent performance as Hamilton, She is a teenager that lost her arm to a shark bite in 1996.  There are shots in the movie showing Anna Sophia struggling with the simplest things like cutting vegetables and making a sandwich after losing her arm.  Her dedication and her talent for the sport of surfing is what makes this movie entertaining.  I admire the skill, balance and coordination that Anna Sophia shows on the surf board.  Director Sean Mcnamara makes surfing look like an exciting and competitive sport.  There is one shot in the movie that shows Anna Sophia going inside of a wave and then coming out of it.  This shot is breathtaking and is a testament to Mcnamara's talent as a director.  Dennis Quaid co stars as Tom Hamilton.  He is Bethany's father.  He gives a good performance as a father who encourages Bethany not to give up her dream as a professional surfer.  Carrie Underwood is good in a supporting role as a youth minister who also encourages Bethany not to give out faith in God as after her accident.  Helen Hunt plays Bethany's mom Cheri.  Her performance is not as good as Quaid's, but she still comes across as a loving mother.  This film is filled with good music.  There is an uplifting song entitled Set The World On Fire\\".  This song is about the strength of the human spirit.  There is a beautiful Hawaiian song entitled \\"Ho Oheno Keia No Beauty\\" that includes excellent ukulele playing. This song adds some Hawaiian flavor to the movie. Soul Surfer is a very entertaining film.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|The Tudors is a lush, visually stunning series, complete with wonderful acting, to-die-for costumes and an award-worthy script. It will have you hooked from scene 1. It is even more amazing that this show is based on factual events and actual people. Most everyone knows the infamous legacy and history of King Henry VIII and his 6 wives, but may not know how everything transpired. Well this show certainly helps to fill in some of those blanks, though I'm sure some plots were embellished and/or imagined either for shock value or just to keep viewers as interested as possible. Whatever the case, it is a great success. The true star of the series is Jonathan Rhys Meyers and he really and truly embraces the role. He is mesmerizing, handsome, arrogant, willful, and above all, very King-like in appearance and manner. He may not be a true likeness to the real King, but I don't think many people would complain. Henry Cavill plays Henry's ever faithful best friend Charles Brandon. His is also an intriguing role. I believe these 2 actors are the only ones to appear in every single episode. There is a multitude of fine actors and actresses, too many to go through but not one actor does a poor job here. It really is impressive.     There are 4 seasons, and they start with Henry's first wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon to his last wife and follow his marriage through two beheadings, a tragic death of his true love, and finally his last wife, Catherine Parr who is ever loyal and faithful. Besides his personal history, the show deals with actual events that transpired, his constant struggles with France and Spain, his seperation from the Catholic Church, and we can't forget the Lutheran burnings. There is too much to go in to but it really is worth a look. The series is not perfect though. There were some aspects of it that bugged me at times. For example, certain subplots never get settled and you are left to wonder what happened. Some characters that appear to be important disappear halfway through a season and never return. Those are minor gripes and certainly don't detract from the series and I can even understand how much of an undertaking a series of this magnitude really is and with so many characters, trying to keep absolutely everything in check can get a bit tricky. Something else that impressed me is the fact that exact phrases were used in certain scenes, from Anne Boleyn's speech at her beheading, to dying Queen Catherine's letter Henry. I thought that was a great touch.    I recommend this series to anyone in love with gorgeous period films, great acting, dramas, as well as history lovers. Also, there is plently of sex, violence and torture, so viewer beware if that is something you are concerned about.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I purchased both of Patrick R's novels (Day One and Day Two) for reading on my Kindle with 24 hours of each other.  Great books both: Light, Easy, 'Can't put it down' reading with all of the elements I enjoy in a Fantasy Novel.  Now to play the waiting game for the next installment. UGH.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|My first purchase on my new Kindle! Great reading---1/2 way through I bought the second installment so I could have it ready for when I finished reading the first....now sadly, I must wait a while (month, maybe years) for the 3rd book....
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary is a great retrospective analysis of the great economic banking system collapse of 2008.  A great analysis of how the economic system was building its own demise and how it finally collapsed on in itself. Finally understand how collateralized debt obligations are related to credit default swaps and the banking systems deregulation allowed them to use deposit assets to accumulate heavily leveraged risks in CDOs.  A very strong argument to bring back the regulation that was put in place after the first great depression.
B00110K62U|5.0|I am amazed how much raw talent is in the cast of the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast when placed against that of the 25th Anniversary. Now, don't get me wrong I did enjoy the 25th Anniversary edition and the storyline was much, much more polished. The beauty in any song is coveyed in emotion and sincerity.    The video presentation of this 10th Anniversary is quite clean and the music just as good.   If anyone is looking for a better alternative of Les Miserable than the Blu-ray of the 25th Anniversary I highly recommend the 10th Anniversary Drean Cast.     Dan Rollins    Ontario, Oregon USA

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fey's book is everything I expected it to be and more. Funny, so funny I was laughing out loud on the subway while I read it. Some nice insight into what it's like to be a woman working in comedy/television, and while she of course points out some of the ways that women are treated unfairly, I never got the sense that she was being unfair or overdramatizing in pointing these things out. Also it was nice to read her perspective on the Sarah Palin stuff. Bossypants is just a great, fast read that fans will love. The pictures interspersed throughout are very funny too.
B003Y5H5KQ|3.0|HANNA is a great example of a film where style and attitude trumps (or nearly) substance and logic.  It's a super-cool looking movie that feels like it is better than it really is.    Young Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES) gives an MVP performance as a teen-age killer.  Raised since she was a baby by Erik (Eric Bana) her father in the middle of what looks like northern Finland...she knows almost nothing of how life works in the civilized world.  Growing up in a wild, snow-shrouded environ, Erik has taught her everything she needs to know about hand-to-hand combat, firearms, bows & arrows, etc., as well as given her an education in languages and practically encouraged her to memorize an encyclopedia.  Erik, you see, is a former CIA agent who is on the run from his bosses, because he \\"knows too much\\" about some nefarious and unsavory program.  He's raising Hanna to be able to survive on her own, because one day, he knows they'll be separated and she needs to be prepared to fight her way to freedom.    That day comes when Hanna insists she's ready to live in the real world.  So Erik pulls out a homing beacon that basically tells his pursuers exactly where to find him and when they show up, Erik has already fled, but Hanna turns herself over to them.  It's never explained why they feel they must take such a loud, noisy, bloody re-entry into society...except that apparently it's worth risking both their lives to try to kill Erik's former boss/handler, Marissa (Cate Blanchett).      Hanna DOES escape, in grand style, and begins her journey to reunite with her father.  Along the way, she is befriended by various colorful \\"ordinary\\" people and we see how ill-prepared Hanna is to interact with society.  She's smart & dangerous, but also touchingly helpless and naïve.  She is pursued by some nasty characters (this movie does NOT make Germans or Germany look very appealing) as she flees from Morocco to Berlin.    A few folks have compared Ronan to the killer girl played by Chloe Grace-Moretz in KICK-A**...but they similarities are very slender.  Moretz was a fast -and-foul talking little sparkplug, world-wise and eager to pile up bodies.  Hanna is slow to speech and is wild-eyed and wondering at the world.    This is Ronan's movie and she totally steals it.  She is a totally striking figure, in her nearly white hair and white eyebrows, with piercing eyes.  But she continues to amaze as an actress as well...totally convincing as a killer, but also believable as just a teenager who has led a sheltered life.  This character is very interesting & engaging, and we root for her.      Bana is fairly bland, but the role is bland.  Blanchett is over-the-top, and proves once and for all (after INDIANA JONES) that she is NOT cut out to play a cartoonish villainess.  She puts on a terrible Southern accent and gives a performance utterly without menace.  I normally love her, but she was quite terrible in HANNA.  (I did enjoy Tom Hollander as the primary assassin chasing Hanna.  He brought a convincing level of creepiness to his performance.)    Director Joe Wright uses his exotic locations well and stages some nifty little action scenes.  There are a lot of shots of Hanna simply running with great urgency, but they reminded me of Franka Potente in RUN LOLA RUN...gripping in their simplicity.    But behind the style, I found a frustrating plot.  Motivations were often sketchy.  Characters behaved in ways that didn't entirely make sense.  The bad guys seemed more adept at crossing the globe than was reasonable.  And this is one of those films where MANY innocent people die so that just two people can live.  Hanna and her father are not important enough to justify the deaths and torturing of so many others...especially folks who befriend Hanna only to die painfully later.      And the climax of the film lacks punch.  The best action sequences come early.  I know the end is supposed to have more emotional heft, but because we don't really care that much about the Blanchett & Bana, the lack of a really spectacular climactic chase or battle really left me with a deflated feeling when the credits began to roll.    But the character of Hanna and the performance of Ronan make the movie worth seeing.  She is a terrific young actress and has thoroughly embraced her untraditional character.  I wouldn't even mind seeing another Hanna movie...keep the visual style and cool locations, but give Hanna some really interested characters to interact with.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This book was well written especially for someone who has little knowledge of Indian culture.  I would highly recommend this book. I couldn't wait to finish it.
B004LWZW24|4.0|A few folks have remarked on how unusual it is that the creators of SAW created a more old-fashioned spookfest with INSIDIOUS.  I guess they've forgotten (for good reason) the promising but ultimately very disappointing DEAD SILENCE, also from SAW writing/directing team Leigh Whannell & James Wan.  They clearly have an affinity for scares over gore.  (Much of SAW, the scenes with Cary Elwes in the \\"dungeon\\" were more psychological horror than gross-out...and are still the most effective moments of the entire series.)    INSIDIOUS is FAR superior to DEAD SILENCE, and frankly, it's far superior to many horror movies of recent years.  Whannell & Wan have been joined by Oren Peli (a producer), the guy behind the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY movies.  I don't know how much of a role Peli played in this film, but there are certainly moments in common.    As with the PA movies, INSIDIOUS uses lots of moments were something suddenly appears or jumps out at you.  We can feel something is coming...the camera, music, silence, etc. built the tension and then POW, it happens, and you give a little jump in your seat.  Many movies try for that.  But Peli and company somehow have the timing down better.  I'm not sure how they do it...but when they go for a jump from their audience, they usually get it.  This is a satisfying experience, and is the reason we tolerate bad acting, silly plots and crowded theaters.  We want the communal experience of getting scared.    INSIDIOUS tells the story of a family that moves into a new house and have weird things start to happen.  Worst of all, one of their sons falls into something like a coma and while nothing is medically wrong with the boy, he is no longer responsive to the world around him.  As weird things continue to happen, mom (Rose Byrne) begs dad (Patrick Wilson) to \\"get out of this house.\\"  Normally, when this scene happens in a horror film (and it's an old cliché indeed), dad gets indignant and says \\"no way\\" and then things really go to hell.  Well here, dad says, \\"okay, we're outta here.\\"  And they move.  Turns out, though, that whatever was bugging them in house #1 has tagged right along to house #2.  Not good.    They turn to \\"professional help\\" and I think I can be forgiven for expecting the help to arrive in the form of a short, eccentric southern lady, as in POLTERGEIST.  INSIDIOUS reminded me of that film in many ways...a solid family, a modern house (not some old mansion that ANYONE would expect to be haunted) and kids in peril and parents willing to do anything to help.    In the final third or so, the plot turns a bit silly and frankly, the scares pretty much dry up.  The ending is disappointing (as it so often is in horror films)...but overall, the film has built up enough goodwill to carry us through to the end.  The film has little gore, and is a nice, solid PG-13.  A scare us adults can enjoy with our older kids.  It plays itself deadly serious from beginning to end, and doesn't pander to the audience.  Yes, it is occasionally sillier than it needs to be...but it's constructed solidly, and is entertaining.    Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson are okay actors and they are okay here.  Wilson, in particular, always strikes me as a bit bland (opposite Ellen Page in HARD CANDY and Kate Winslet in LITTLE CHILDREN, he practically disappears)...but he has a stolid earnestness that works for him here.  Byrne always has dark circles under her eyes and looks underfed, and this helps her (at  least physically) look the part of a worried-to-death mom.  Whannell, Wan & Peli are working with a small budget here...so presumably they couldn't get better actors.  I'll forgive them all that, because they also seem to be single-handedly keeping alive the good, honestly-earned scare.

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|On EVO:    The top feature of this app is the ability to send files to my phone while my phone is anywhere in the house (as long as the phone's wifi is on, of course).     When I work out, I like to watch shows I've downloaded from my Tivo on my phone. But trudging downstairs to hook up the phone and wait for the files to transfer was such a hassle. This program works flawlessly. My main computer is downstairs (where the Tivo'd content ends up after transcoding), but most of my life is lived upstairs, where my phone usually is. I can jump on my wife's laptop and send shows from my computer downstairs to my phone upstairs, and I'm ready to roll the next day.    I highly recommend this app and this developer. The app was recently updated with some killer new features.     One caveat: I also had this app on my Hero and it didn't work well. But that was because of the defective wifi in the Hero. Depending on the size of the files (mine are about 290MB per), you really need a stable wifi connection in your house and on your phone. Any hiccup that interrupts the connection will cause file transfers to fail.    About the only thing I wish this app could do is initiate transfers FROM the phone. As far as I know, that feature doesn't exist in any app yet. So for now, this is a key app on my EVO.
0446691437|4.0|I'm glad I ordered this book as I found that as soon as I had received it I could not put it down. I subscribe to Steven Pressfield's blog and don't always agree with what he has to say, however I found this slim tome quite relevant to my everyday life and how procrastination often gets in the way. I would recommend this book to friends, especially those with an artistic inclination. I would also recommend [[ASIN:1585421472 The Artist's Way]] by Julia Cameron. This book runs along the same lines, but it gives more practical advice about how to overcome blocks.
0061726826|5.0|How terrible, to live a life of sameness day after day!  Would you give up all the exhilarating highs, the passion, the excitement and seduction and joy of love, not only for your spouse but love of any kind - for your children, for parents, first loves and all the loves along the way - if it meant you never had to feel the despair, rejection, heartache, sadness that can also go along with love?  Your new life, after you have been \\"cured\\" of this terrible disease of \\"amor deliria nervosa\\" would have a sameness to it.  No highs, no lows.  You will choose your marriage partner from a list given to you by the government.  And anyone straying from the norm is punished, all the way up to a death sentence.<br /><br />\\"Delirium\\" was a very frightening dystopian book to me.  It did not seem all that unbelievable that the events actually happen.  No more wars, no major crimes since these involve passion of some sort - a solution that possibly could be considered by Big Brother.<br /><br />To me, love of all kinds is worth the pain I've had to experience and I'm sure will experience again.  I guess that's what makes it worth fighting for.<br /><br />I'm glad to read that this is the first book in a trilogy.  I usually prefer stand-alone novels like Oliver's previous book [[ASIN:006172680X Before I Fall]] but I want to continue reading about Lena's world.  This is a book I will think about a lot in the future...what if?<br /><br />For your info:  some strong language, some passionate scenes, some violence.<br /><br />If you like this genre of books, I think you will enjoy [[ASIN:0545265355 Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset]] and/or [[ASIN:B0030C4PGK Uglies, The Collector's Set: Uglies, Pretties, Specials, Extras (Paperback)]].
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|I've been a huge Porcupine Tree fan for years but I just could not get much out of this album. \\"Time Flies\\" is probably the only song I really enjoy from the album - it has an undeniable Pink Floyd - Animals sound which is awesome. I also like \\"I Drive the Hearse,\\" but beyond that no song really stands out to me. It's unfortunate - I was excited to buy the album and listened with the hope of being wowed like I have so many other times by PT. The magic from In Abstenia, Deadwing, Stupid Dream, etc. just wasn't here.
0545265355|5.0|Though the first book is certainly the best, the other two do not disappoint. These are wonderful books - light, fun, but yet somehow somewhat sophisticated. I didn't feel \\"trashy\\" after reading these as I did some similar books, like Twilight.    I think the difference is that these books actually have stronger female characters, and aren't all about some cheesy, overblown, frustrating love strong. Katnis is a heroine, and isn't fussing about her hair or boys (at least not the whole time).    This is one of the books where, like Harry Potter, people of all ages can enjoy it. And, parents can give the books to their children without worrying about the role models.    Excellent all around!

I don't know what part of it Mr. Baldacci wrote, perhaps he wrote Oliver's name or maybe Mary Chapman's.  This is so disjointed and frustrating I could scream (and did).  All of the various authors apparently didn't read the previous chapters to find out what had happened with the characters and didn't take into consideration bugged phones, Oliver behaving stupidly, Adelphia acting out of character (even though it turns out she is an Isreali spy.<br /><br />The frustration started with the characters in the park...

B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is one of those albums that takes you on a mystical magical musical journey.  U start at the beginning and let your soul take in what ur ears absorb. Enjoy the ride.  Rainbow Children is a nice album to play on an easy sunday afternoon, or maybe play while u r doing some spring cleaning.  Every song is fantastic, and each song has a spiritual meaning.  U can play this album instead of reading the bible, it's pretty much the same thing, same message.  I even like the artwork and the colourful liner notes that accompany the cd.  This a a creative whirlwind that Prince has created, adding beauty and meaning 2 life that only Prince can orchestrate.

B0000DEQXD|4.0|A glorious performance.  The recording was made from a noisy audience seat, it seems; the artifacts can distract.  Voices are far away, then in your face.  Anyone who knows the 1947 Toscanini Otello (restored at pristine audio) will understand that nothing can touch its lightning; the opera unfolds as a single breath.  So, that is the recording to start with -- but probably after seeing the opera on DVD (perhaps Karajan's).
B00009Z574|4.0|The album that came to be known as \\"Tormato\\" really should have been called \\"Yes Tor.\\"  The actual Yes Tor, a high point of land in the county of Devon in southwestern England, can be seen on the album's cover, behind the man in the suit with the dowsing rods, and the tomato splatter.  \\"Yes Tor\\" would have been a good title, and would have matched up well with titles like \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Yessongs.\\"  But the band went with the title \\"Tormato,\\" and with the suit and the dowsing rods and the tomato splatter.  Oh, well.  What is to be found behind the silly title and equally silly album cover is actually an album of pretty good Yes music; if it doesn't quite hit the heights of \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"Fragile,\\" it is still tuneful and well-played 1970's British progressive rock.  \\"Future Times\\" benefits from Chris Squire's phase-shifted bass; with soaring vocals, and fine counterpoint between keyboards and guitar, this song segues smoothly into \\"Rejoice.\\"  On \\"Don't Kill the Whale,\\" Steve Howe's guitar work is all over the place, and Jon Anderson's vocals sound a bit shrill; the thumping beat and an overwrought keyboard solo contribute to a sense that the band is simply trying too hard on this one.  \\"Madrigal\\" is gentle and poetic and builds well; Rick Wakeman's knowledge of the history of English music really comes through here.  \\"Release, Release\\" is energetic, with an unexpected drum solo by Alan White, but feels rather like a draft, a pastiche; the sheer frenetic pace of the song doesn't provide enough time for the vocals.  The band tries for a whimsical quality on the spacey \\"Arriving UFO\\" and the reggae-tinged \\"Circus of Heaven,\\" but the quality of whimsy seems strained on both.  But things look up considerably with Squire's evocative and tuneful love song \\"Onward,\\" on which Anderson's vocals really shine.  \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" is a bit busy in places, but at least it sounds as though the band's having fun.  Because \\"Tormato\\" was not one of the stronger Yes albums, it benefits particularly from added material, starting with the straightforward and direct \\"Abilene.\\"  The uptempo \\"Money,\\" with its spoken-word background, sounds almost New Wave-ish.  \\"Picasso\\" possesses gentle, understated vocals by Anderson, and keyboards, bass, and guitar combine nicely on the song.  \\"Some Are Born\\" starts off mellow, but then transitions into an all-purpose jam.  \\"You Can Be Saved\\" benefits from nice harmonies and keyboard stylings.  The deft and guitar-oriented \\"High\\" features some interesting time changes.  \\"Days,\\" a vocal interlude, is followed by \\"Countryside,\\" an acoustic guitar-based song that brings in organ and vocal harmonies in a manner almost reminiscent of CSNY.  \\"Everybody's Song\\" starts off acoustic and turns electric; they're clearly having fun jamming away, but Anderson's vocals are hard to hear.  And the untitled hidden track that concludes the album, a reprise of the instrumental track for \\"Onward,\\" closes this expanded version of the album with a sense of completeness that was largely lacking in the original.  This is good, not great Yes, but fans of the band's 1970's incarnation should find it suitable.

0802798225|1.0|Well if you like a teen book with lots of swear words, sexual enuindos, crude behavior and I am sure latter you would probably have a couple of sex scenes. I didn't last that long. I only read till the eighth chapter but it's a story that has been retold a million times the only difference with this one is it's filthy. If you liked the premise of this book there is a book by Kristen Randal called Breaking Rank that is a lot like this but much cleaner and an amazing read!
0670022411|5.0|Ok, I have read some of the reviews.  Yes, is can be construed as a grown up Twilight.   I looked at it that way in the beginning but I was also stuck on an airplane with nothing else.  So I plowed through it.  I am glad I did.    This book gives you a historical look of books, dives into alchemy, it gives you some adventure and gives you a very tender romance.  The kind where a girl of today wants to be treated SOMEWHAT like a girl of yester year. We also get fantasy, time travel, vampires, daemons and witches.  The writer creates her own story regarding what these creatures can do and not do.      Once home, I couldn't do anything but finish the book, caught myself rushing and slowed myself down many times to enjoy it.  Yea some of it can be slightly farfetched but we all need an escape.  You fall for the main characters Diana and Matthew and I completly have become completly invested in this story.  Can not wait for the next book!  Hurry I feel lost!
B004J713JW|5.0|I placed a pre-order for this a while back and it was delayed a couple times.  I was reading that there were some audio issues with the blu-ray and some tracks missing much of the bass.  After listening all the way through I didn't hear any issues with the sound track.    The concert itself was very enjoyable.  There were a few tracks missing that I would have liked to see but overall I was very satisfied.  I loved the performance of 'Piano Man'.  He must have loved to have all of Shea singing to him.
B001HN694K|4.0|Absolutely no one but Johnny Depp could have ever gotten me to watch this movie, I hated it as a child and was not thrilled about watching it as an adult. But I did, and I can't say I loved it, but I did not hate it, and that is saying alot in itself. I absolutely love Johnny Depp and would probally watch anything he did, am dying for the new Pirates, I could not believe that they even dared to think they could do a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without him, what a joke that would have been, and not a funny one either, as if anyone could ever be \\"Captain Jack Sparrow\\" except Johnny Depp, parish the thought.  Anyway, back to Alice. It was enjoyable to a degree, funny at times, even sad at times, But it was Johnny Depp that made this movie what it was, at least for me, I would not have ever even considered watching it otherwise.

B001IF252M|4.0|Does exactly what it says it does.  I am using with a mid-2010 13'' MacBook Pro on a Sony LCD TV.  Sometimes it takes a few sleep wake cycles to get the image from laptop to tv screen, but it always eventually works.  I have another one that relies on HDMI connectivity to the TV, but I need the HDMI ports for other devices, so I use this analog plug.  The HDMI cable provides a much crisper image with better color density and refresh rate.  I can also get 1080p res from the HDMI cable.  The analog is 1600*900 (not terrible, but nothing to brag about).  My only real beef is the price.  Knockoff companies make the same plug for less $$, but they always seem to have a major flaw.  Buy this, just do it...
B0041KKYCY|1.0|This movie was as vile to me as either \\"Hostel,\\" \\"Hostel 2,\\" or \\"High Tension.\\"  A remake of an 80s cult favorite, this movie decided to be as repugnant as it could be--and succeeded.  You've heard the story, so I won't bore you with it again.  All I can say is that if you were disturbed by the rape scene in the remake of \\"Last House on the Left,\\" honey, you ain't seen nothing compared to this one, because it goes on and on and on and on.  And just when you think it's over, it starts again.<br /><br />This movie belongs in a trash heap.

Someone else observed that they found it interesting that Daria and Jane's high school and life experiences are still as relevant today as they were when the series aired.  This was based on their recollections of high school life as well as what they observed in the lives of their children today.  But what I found interesting and a bit scary is that it was relevant for me as well since it accurately reflected my own experiences in high school complete with all the various stereotypes and situations showcased in this fantastic series. So what you say? Well my high school days were back in the 60's.  This is really a great series and the video and sound quality are top notch. You can't go wrong getting this remarkable and funny, thought provoking series.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|This has to be the best electronic score I have heard in quite sometime.  I have been a Daft Punk fan for years, and upon hearing that they were scoring this movie, gave me chills.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The score was very fitting to the story that the movie was trying to convey (the movie could have been much better).  If I dare say, the music enhanced the visuals in certain scenes (no spoilers).<br /><br />The only thing that would have kept this from being a 5 star item would have been for Walt Disney Records to release extended tracks of the score...some of the songs had Daft Punk written all over them, but they were short and had me wanting more.<br /><br />Overall...outstanding effort by Guy-Manuel and Thomas!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I love psychological thrillers and this one will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.  This film really sticks with you.  After leaving the theatre it was all I could think about.  Love, love, love it. Beautifully filmed, and the dancing is magnificent.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I downloaded both Shazam and SoundHound and eventually chose SoundHound. They both seem to have similar features and do as well idendifying songs but SoundHound will run on my SD card and Shazam won't so with an htc Desire with limited memory I have to go with the one that will run from the SD card.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|This was a very well done documentary and the interviewer did a great job of keeping his cool in the interviews.  It took the concepts at issue and made them accessible to any audience.    I thought it was organized significantly better than Michael Moore's Capitalism a Love Story.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I got to the end of he pre-installed version. Confused, I checked online to see that my app was missing an entire level. One post suggested downloading a newer version. It crashes moments after it starts.
B003Y3BMFM|1.0|this is not new double cd by soundgarden, (who is one of my favorite bands.) i honestly dont know why this was released very ,pissed when i got it.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|Some people have commented on this being a talk feast or soap opera. To be frank I get the impression that those viewers were 12 year olds. (I'm over 40). I have to admit that I am bit of a Zombie fan, but thats because I find zombies scarier than most other genre. The whole mindless uncaring flesh eating monster scares the hell out of me. My wife? Well she is less than entusiastic. But this is in fact the first time she has enjoyed a zombie fest. My Wife, my Daughter(16) and myself watched the whole thing over 2 nights. Everytime we finished an episode we had to watch another one. We enjoyed it so much we had to ration ourselves.    Why was it so good? Because the story or should I say the characters reactions were understandable and believable. You could identify with them. There was interesting drama. Lets face it the only story you can create in a zombie armageddon is about the survivors and their struggles. Zombies 24/7 over six hours would be boring. I am going to get series 2 when its released for certain.     Side comment, I live in Australia, thank god for amazon. The free to air television in this country is a joke. Addicted to reality tv and reruns, only pushs their audiences to DVD series purchases where you can view quality product without adds.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a pretty brilliant film, managing to tastefully and touchingly walk the line between comedy and genuine emotional depth, all in a context of death and funereal ceremonies.<br /><br />The main character, Daigo, loses his job as cellist in a Tokyo symphony orchestra when the orchestra goes out of business. He and his wife are forced to move back to Daigo's rural home town, and Daigo falls into a job as a kind of mortician. The film goes into some very beautiful and sometimes comedic scenes about Daigo's job, preparing the corpse for departure -- which really is a service for the benefit of the loved ones who remain.<br /><br />In the process, much is learned about the nature of death, love and service -- and in general the meaning of life.<br /><br />With beautiful music and cinematography to complement a wonderful screenplay, this lighthearted yet very serious study of unexpected joy discovered in life's dark times is not to be missed.
0439023491|5.0|I am not a big reader but i loved this series.  I read it in no time flat and LOVED the story.
1591843790|5.0|I am a big fan of \\"The Art of the Start\\" and so I wasn't surprised that I continue to be enchanted by Guy's playful manner and straightforward approach on doing good business.    Keep up the good work!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I loved the 10th anniversary concert but the 25th - particularly in its BluRay version - is absolutely wonderful. Some of the reviews I've read have expressed disappointment in Nick Jonas' performance and I must concur - not the strongest, but at least adequate.  This is a very small criticism, however.  Overall this is a very beautiful and spectacular production.  The joint performances with prior cast members during the encore are worth the cost of the DVD alone.
1594202842|1.0|I really don't get how forcing your kids to do something is sending a message that they are strong and capable. I learned to be strong and capable as a young woman by doing things on my own, makig my own decisions, learning from my mistakes, etc. No, I didn't go to an Ivy League school. But I went to college, my parents didn't even review the applications I turned in as I recall. I even got a Ph.D. Now in my fifties and having dealt with and continuing to deal with the many issues that life throws at you, I shudder to think how I would keep my balance without having learned my own lessons myself, on my terms, at a young age. I'm sorry, but micro-managing is creepy, no matter how lofty the goal. I also just don't understand how everything somehow became the responsibility of mothers. Young people are so under-rated these days, and frankly the real reason is that there are not jobs for them. They have to spend all their time at the piano or what else would they have to do with their time, is what it looks like. Next it will be flower arranging:  America is becoming like Victorian England, full of accomplished idle rich young people and a quasi feudal class of help.
0756404738|5.0|Great plot and character developmment.   It definately falls into the fantasy genre, but unlike many other such books, this one is all about the story.
B003UESJF6|4.0|I was glad that I purchased this movie. It was in great condition. My grandchildren loved this movie. What makes them happy makes me happy.
B0034G4OY0|4.0|Over the last few years, I've learned to appreciate Clint Eastwood's work, now more for his directing than the movies he's starred in the past. Don't get me wrong, he's had more than his share of hits as a great actor but as he continues to direct and make movies of all types of genre, his work just gets better. As in the case of Hereafter, I was fairly surprised that he would touch on subjects like these - life, death, what happens after? If you're looking for an action movie, this ain't it. There were some great special effects in the beginning which was bold but yet tragic cause it reminds you of what's happened before. The movie starts off slow but the ending is well worth the time spent watching. I love how the movie factors in chance so that all the main characters somehow meet to help each other at the end. Also, the film never touches on Religion, God, Hell, and Heaven but simply leaves that idea to you. Matt Damon, of course, great as always! For those who like movies that makes you think about the \\"what if's\\" and movies that make you reflect on ideas that you don't normally think of, watch it! I'll be waiting to see what Clint Eastwood comes up with next.     PS. There is a documentary called \\"The Eastwood Factor\\" on the Special Features which is interesting and worth having for any movie collector.
B000002KIK|2.0|Ok, so its not as bad as Technical Exctasy or Vol 4. but it still blows, overall. The title track has always been a favorite, and I find some interesting moments with \\"Swinging the Chain\\" sung by Ward, and \\"Air Dance\\". Hard Road fittingly has the whole band singing as sort of bon voyage, but the Greatestness of Sabbath died after Sabotage. I wish the original singer on this album got his shot. Ozzy was the band's worst singer, though the one that defined them.     My greatest fear right now, is that the band will stop suing one another and reunite, but if they do, it should be with the understanding that Ozzy will sing Digital B*tch from Born Again. That would be some justice. Dio is dead and so is Black Sabbath.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|Tale of an executive producer (McAdams) who joins a failing network in the hopes to revitalize it before it gets pulled.  The quality of the show is amped up by some of the big names in the film.  Humor gets really good when McAdams sensationalizes the morning news with all types of crazy actions.  Ernie was the best supporting character in the film for those laughs.

630521610X|5.0|Scream is probably one of Wes Craven's best films! It has a lot of suspense and chills!<br />Written by a screenplay by Kevin Williamson (Dawsons Creek). Scream has a lot of smart humor as well as some good scares.<br />Once you finish watching Scream, you want to continue with watching Scream 2!
B002ZG993Q|4.0|American audiences may be shocked by the main character's action in the very beginning.  That said, it felt true for a character who was a combination of an assassin and arms dealer and was always on the run from his enemies (yes, they make appearances in the movie) but that said this is not an action picture.  It's more of a character driven piece that does a surprisingly good job focusing (in a subtle manner) on a man who is having second thoughts about his vile life.  There's a priest and a lover to challenge his lifestyle.  I felt the priest did a better than expected job for the role.  The setting takes place mostly in a charming little town in Italy.  There are several subtleties in this film so pay attention.  The picture was based on a novel named a VERY PRIVATE GENTLEMAN but it doesn't follow the book in several instances.  STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus; UNDERWORLD AUTHENTICITY  (for a film): B plus to A minus.; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early April 2011.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I've loved Maroon 5 from day 1! Adam Levine's voice is very smooth and melow. The band plays beautifully throughout the entire album, the acoustics and rhythm are wonderful. I recommend \\"Hands All Over\\" to all my friends. Another great album by Maroon 5! Great work guys.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that I am a reader, but I do not live by reading books. Therefore, this review is based off an opinion of someone who cannot explain the structure or fluidity of a book. I can only speak out of the entertainment and joy this particular story brought me. I merely come to you saying that this is the first book I have picked up in a significant amount of time. My profession limits me from spending much time reading. Nonetheless, when I began reading this book, I began to MAKE the time to read. From my point of view, Mr. Rothfuss has a unique way of creating and maintaining the protagonist in this chapter of a three part series. Not only is the protagonist interesting and appealing to readers of many ages, but as are the rest of the personalities presented.    I will not go on mulling about the book's plot for I am not a fan of spoilers and will not participate in such behavior. I only bid you the recommendation of a light reader that has been re-united with the wonder of literature by one as gifted as Patrick Rothfuss. This is an EXCELLENT read and should be viewed as such. If you are looking for a engrossing story about love, despair, adventure, ambitions and a little bit of magical flair, this is the perfect story to become involved with. Happy reading and I hope that this review helped someone make a wise decision.
0545140323|5.0|Penny Lane's parents are obsessed with the Beatles, in case you couldn't tell by her name. Penny has been burned by love for the last time, when her summer crush cheats on her. Penny decides what she needs is to declare herself the sole member of her own Lonely Hearts Club. Penny will not date any boys for the remainder of her high school career. Some other students end up being mistreated by guys too and decide they want to join up. Soon enough there are over 40 girls meeting at Penny's house and cementing their females relationships. The school principal and many of the high school boys aren't too keen on the club. Penny holds her ground, these girls really need a support system and they all want to stick together. The club starts to become more about friendship and improving yourself and grades instead of an actual Lonely Hearts Club.<br /><br />This novel was complete fab. I could not stop laughing out loud throughout it. Penny Lane is a fantastic character and a great leader to the girls. She is just such a real person, shy about taking control, but does what needs to be done. I would have loved something like this when I was in high school, a huge support system of friends who have your back no matter what. It was nice to see all these girls for-going cliques and class years to band together to better themselves. Penny had mentioned at one point that they should all study together, since the older girls had already had a lot of the classes the younger ones were taking and therefore could help them out. Now, this book was definitely not all about grades and bettering oneself. There was plenty of boy drama. I could see why Penny would have to give up boys, they were all up in her stuff this whole book. All the characters were really great, even though Penny was really the primary focus of the book. Her two best friends made a good team and evened each other out. Really though this book was just a great, funny read about a club that ends up being more than it was supposed to be. This is up there in funny-ness with the Georgia Nicolson series, so seriously check this book out!<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"When I was five years old, I walked down the aisle with the man of my dreams.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"'Right! I remember that you had to be John and I was Paul and we had stuffed animals be Ringo and George.'\\"d to be.

B000002VTE|5.0|This is a massive album. Symphonic, romantic, and psychedelic, like Wagner on acid. I think that's been properly established by other reviewers at this point. It's all well and good, but what puts it among my all-time favorites is the way such grandiose music can be so personal and poignant.  As a fan of great storytelling, I have a tendency to interpret albums as concept albums. For example, when I first bought The Wite Stripes' \\"White Blood Cells\\", I thought it was actually a lo-fi rock opera about childhood romance. \\"Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space\\" is the same way for me.  But how so? In a single sentence, here's what I think: the album is a concept album about a troubled romantic type (presumably the band's brain, Jason Pierce) who relies on drugs and alcohol to cope with unrequited love.  Track by track, it works out almost perfectly. The first track begins withe the line \\"All I want in life's a little love to take the pain away/Gettin' strong today/One giant step each day\\". As it progresses, the song blooms into an overwhelming chorus of repeating lines layered and overlaping over and into each other, like expanding circles. \\"I will love you all the time/And I will love you 'till I die\\".  It's all very sweet, but things soon start to go downhill with track 2, \\"Come Together\\", a rocker with saxophones that, amazingly, don't sound like crap. About halfway through the song, Jason sings bitterly, \\"Now Little J's a ***ked up boy who dulled the pain and killed the joy/Those tracks of time/Those tracks are mine/Little J is occupied.\\" Rhythmicly, it sounds sort of like iambic pentameter (the heartbeat pattern that Shakespeare uses). It represents the start of the character's drug use.  Then comes my personal favorite, track 3, \\"I Think I'm in Love\\". At about eight minutes in length \\"I Think I'm in Love\\" has two basic segments. The first one is musically euphoric, with lyrics describing the nearly divine bliss of a heroin high. Some people have criticized it for glorifying heroin use, but in the conext of the rest of the album, its image as an eventually destructive escape method becomes pretty clear. The second part of the song features the familiar theme of a the woozy optimisim of the beginning stages of falling in love. However, a pessimistic side comment follows every love-dumb line. When Jason confidently sings \\"I think my name is on your lips!\\", a second Jason immediately follows, singing \\"Probably complainin'...\\". It's actually pretty funny, and one of the more original metaphorical 'love as a drug' songs. The heroin dream represents Jason's sincere feelings of love while his doubtful side comments represent reality creeping in. The music, of course, is perfectly evocative and beautiful  The two songs that follow, \\"All My Thoughts \\"Stay With Me\\", smoothly witness the slide from infatuation (or perhaps obsession, depending on how cynical you are about love) into desperation. Then comes \\"Electricity\\", another song apparently about a drug high. It's the fastest and most traditionally 'rock and roll' song on the album.  \\"Home of the Brave\\" is one of the more unusual songs on the album. Its music sounds like a melodic squal of noise, which reminds me of my beloved Shoegazers My Bloody Valentine and Ride. \\"Home\\"'s squall, however, acts more as a background for Jason's extremely vulnerable singing. Some of the best lines on the album are in this sad come-down song. \\"Sometimes have my breakfast right off of a mirror/And sometimes I have it right out of a bottle\\" . . . \\"I don't even miss you/but that's 'cos I'm ***ked up/I'm sure when it wears off that I will be hurting.\\"  \\"Home of the Brave\\" segues directly into \\"The Individual\\". This is the song that some of the more critical reviews have attacked. It's understandable, considering that it's not so much a song as it is about 5 minutes of noise. I personally don't mind it, and I see it as a symbol of the fuzzed out, confused nature of J's drug-addled brain.  By track nine, \\"Broken Heart\\", the man is back in action, packing more despair into the song than all the songs that precede it combined. I see this as 'the sober song'. His delusions gone, J sings the brutal truths of his situation: \\"And I'm wasted all the time/I gotta drink you right off of my mind/I've been told that this will heal given time/But I have a broken heart/And I'm crying all the time/I have to keep it covered up with a smile/And I keep on moving on for a while/But I have a broken heart\\". Musicically speaking, the song is a flat-out ballad complete with strings and a French horn. No wonder it was used as a single.  Track 10, \\"No God Only Religion\\", is another instrumental puzzler, and I admit that I'm a bit puzzled about what it's supposed to mean, if it means anything to begin with. It's noisy, but still more accessible than \\"The Individual\\", and has a weird symphonic musical phrase that repeats, almost like a march. If I had to compare it to another piece of music, it'd be Nine Inch Nails' \\"Pilgrimage\\" instrumental from \\"The Fragile\\".  Track 11, \\"Cool Waves\\" sounds like a closing track with a big ol' gospel choir singing along as J seems to come to terms with his loss, singing sadly \\"Baby if you gotta leave, you gotta leave.\\" It reminds me of \\"Goodnight\\", the song that ends The Beatles' White Album.   . . . But it's not the closing track. Track 12, \\"Cop Shoot Cop...\\", is a menacing yet reserved 17 minute jam with long waves of heavy feedback. Kinda cool, but very out of place on such a personal album. It's as if \\"Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space\\" was recorded as a double vinyl album, but wasn't long enough to have a fourth side, so \\"Cop Shoot Cop\\" was added as an afterthought.
B000I5SY5U|4.0|Michael York and Liza Minnelli made an excellent duo wrt to contrasting personalities but similar desires. This was the first film I'd seen with a young Liza, which made me realize she was quite fetching. Though, I couldn't decide if I was frightened or enthralled by her eyelashes.
B003AYPMCO|5.0|If you like Judas Priest you must have this in your collection.  It is a deal considering you get the remastered original record, the live 30th anniversary show and the DVD.  They are older but who isn't?  They sound great.<br />Others have provided or will provide greater details on this set so I don't need to do that - just get this edition, you will not regret it.
0670022411|1.0|I tried. I love the supernatural mixed up in a great story. This is none of that. After 300 or so pages waiting for something to happen I realized, that is just it, nothing is going to happen beyond knowing the main character is a boring, tea drinking, compulsive exerciser. There was no point, no result. I could tweet my daily activities and it would about the same, \\"Alarm goes off. Hit the snooze. Get up to use the bathroom. Look at husband sleeping with mouth open while sitting on the throne...\\"
B0016OMFPW|5.0|If you like Jazz then this is one of the best albums available.  The Roy Hargrove Quintet consists of amazing musicians who click very well together.  Roy Hargrove is obviously a virtuoso but this quartet sounds better with each listening.  Buy the Album, you need to hear it all.
B000089RV6|3.0|What can you say? AC/DC's best album. Arrived in perfect condition. Only thing is, it took almost a month to get it. Well, I was pre-warned. Don't think I'll order from China again.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|I honestly had never heard of this movie before receiving it other than to know it was based on a true story, which I liked.  The movie \\"127 Hours\\" is about a man who loves venturing around in the outdoors, specifically canyons in Utah.  One weekend he packs up a backpack and heads out a remote canyon in Utah.  He runs into two girls and they explore together, but then they go their own ways, that was Saturday afternoon.  So now Aron (James Franco) is on his own and he falls in a canyon with a boulder landing right on his arm.  Aron basically sees his life flash before his eyes and hallucinates for those 127 hours he is stuck down there.  I was amazed watching this movie how he knew what to do and how he survived for that long period of time without basically much food or water.  I admit when it came time for him to get his arm out from being stuck under the boulder, I couldn't watch, but he obviously survived.  He got himself out and luckily ran into hikers who helped him and got him to safety.  It is a true story of survival, triumph, willpower, and cherishing what you have.<br /><br />Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.
0316056863|5.0|I bought the audio CD version of this book because I just never have enough time for reading these days and I really needed something to make me laugh while driving to work. I was NOT disappointed. Generally, I'm not a fan of memoirs - they're a little too whiny for me, which is why I just loved this book. Even when Tina Fey whines, which really isn't very often, it's hilarious. Her stories are just plain fun and completely worth the money - and trust me, the audio CD version took a chunk outa the ol' pay check.<br /><br />Another reviewer here said she only laughed four times during the whole book -- the only thing I can figure is that the person must have had a sense-of-humor-ectomy, because Bossypants is loaded with giggles, chuckles and outright guffaws. I even snorted once or twice. Great job Tina! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00275EGWY|3.0|Not bad but hardly worthy of the Academy Award for Best Picture. I can't believe it also got Best Director. This beat out Avatar. Unbelievable!!!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Me and my 9 year old twins absolutely love, love, love BTR!  Of course, we got hooked on Big Time Rush (the TV show) because my kids are huge fans of all the shows on Nick that are geared towards tweens/teens. (BTR, iCarly, Drake & Josh) But in addition to being great actors (some of these guys have had parts in other shows before Big Time Rush), with excellent comedic timing, they are incredibly musically talented. They each have a different sound vocally, but when you blend their voices together, especially when they harmonize, like they do on so many of their songs, it is pure magic! Funny thing is, I purchased the CD for my kids, but I too love every single track on this CD.  Every single song is terrific.  My son has to listen to the entire CD every single night while falling asleep. This is fantastic music!  I heard that the CD just went gold, and I'm not one bit surprised. I can't wait for their next CD to come out.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love all the songs in the CD.  It is very worth buying this CD at such a reasonable price.  Bruno Mars sings beautifully.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|The only think keeping this from getting zero to one stars is Natalie Portman's great performance.     While beautifully shot and directed, the story becomes utterly cliched and predictable. For all the hype and bravado this film had received, I went into it with a \\"devil's advocate\\" frame of mind. I admit, it was \\"enjoyable\\" some of the time and kept my interest. That said, it isn't at all the great \\"psychological thriller\\" so many have made it out to be. I was not on the edge of my seat at all and roughly one quarter in, I knew exactly how this would all turn out. The plot devices fail almost every time.     The failure here is in the writing.     Worth a look...but not worthy of the stellar reviews.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Regardless of the price! In fact, it's quite inexpensive, easy to use, and quite safe even for us klutzes to use. I'd especially recommend this to folks who are in the \\"I should sharpen my knives better\\" camp. This is easy to use, compact, and removes so many excuses. Hard to go wrong with this. Note that the negatives reviews tend to be folks who are extremely serious about their knife sharpening systems. If you fall into that camp (I don't) then maybe this is a little cheap toy, for the rest of us, it works nicely.
B004LWZW24|2.0|I seldom agree with critics when it comes to film revews (see my Black Swan review), but I am in total agreement on \\"Insidious\\". This film has a pretty strong and effectively creepy first act and sets the stage for even BIGGER scares later on. Unfortunately...that is where it fails. After about an hour, this potential scary classic delves into the realm of stupidity. It's as if the writer sat down and fell in love with the concept....and then let it get away from them. Like many of the reviews here, I completely agree the scares should be about what you DON'T see. The old Hitchcock device that worked so well for Spielburg in \\"Jaws\\", works well here..for about forty five minutes. Then it becomes \\"Poltergeist\\"...but not a GOOD version.     The writer and director both wear their infulences on their sleeves and there are equal parts \\"Exorcist\\" and \\"Poltergeist\\" here. The sad thing is, this film does neither effectively enough to be an homage.     I won't give out any spoilers here...but I will say the ending clearly demonstrates that the writer just \\"gave up\\".
B004132HZS|5.0|but this series is superb! After the best portrayer of Holmes (Jeremy Brett) passed away, I figured that was it for any more decent video regarding my favorite consulting detective. I'm glad to be proven wrong by this series. It's clean, crisp and brilliantly written. In A Study In Pink, I laughed at \\"a three patch problem\\", but he really does need a vice. After all, it's what makes Holmes Holmes, old or young. Smokes or pipe. Bring one in and stop trying to be so PC. Minor quibble, but it irks me. Just don't let that stop you from watching these episodes. New season is slated to start in Nov. 2011. Be there!
0811876373|5.0|Cake pops have spread across the internet like wildfire, and Bakerella started it all. This book showcases the cuteness and creativity that readers of her blog have come to expect combined with a practical, easy to use format. A great addition to any baker's cookbook collection!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Saw this movie over the weekend.  I must say I was a little afraid that it would be a let down after reading the book, so many times the book doesn't translate well into a movie. Not in this case, besides a few changes that were made, nothing major, the story/movie was spot on. Loved the twist at the end, and how every actor played their part to perfection. I can only hope that they bring back Mickey for a follow up movie sometime down the road. For the readers out there, give this series a try, you want be disappointed.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I've had and used earlier iterations of the Amazon MP3 Application on my android devices before, but the continued evolution - and integration with general Amazon features - is promising and pleasing. Being able to access both local and remote music files from a single application is an excellent step forward, though it'd be a bit better if they could be in one general listing (challenging as that might be to represent).<br /><br />This could easily become the 'daily driver' player, but like other reviewers I'd love to see two additions:<br /><br />1/ integration with the lock screen (ala Songbird)<br />2/ Support for the scrobbling standards (e.g. with Last.FM or third party scrobblers).<br /><br />Putting these in a review is... unlikely to get a response, but a quick look around I couldn't see how best to add enhancement requests directly.

0307593495|4.0|One might initially believe that the \\"troubled man\\" of the title in this final book of Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander series, is a certain Hakan von Enke.  Hakan von Enke and Kurt Wallander are the paternal and maternal grandfathers to Clara, the child of von Enke's son and Wallander's daughter.  Von Enke and Wallander meet for the first time at von Enke's 75th birthday party.  Von Enke takes Wallander aside and engages him in a long conversation implying that he, von Enke, is in danger.    Shortly afterward, von Enke vanishes.  Kurt Wallander, of course, investigates.  But as the investigation proceeds it becomes more and more clear that the real \\"troubled man\\" is Kurt Wallander.  One night, Kurt goes out for a late meal, and absent-mindedly leaves his service revolver on his seat in the restaurant when he leaves.  A flustered restaurant owner rushes to the police station and turns in the revolver, explaining what happened.  This is merely the beginning of Wallander's troubles.    Wallander loses a filling from one of his teeth and feels that his body is falling apart on him.  He drives places and then for a moment or two can't remember why he drove there.  He leaves his stove on and almost sets his house afire while he sunbathes on the lawn, etc.  He fears getting old.  He fears death.  Still, he devotes himself to his search for the vanished Hakan von Enke.    His investigation takes him (and us) to meet a most interesting assortment of unpredictable people...an ageing waitress who in the old days used to wait tables for the military upper crust and then sell bits of information which she overheard to the Russians to help make ends meet; the wife of a former schoolmate of Wallander's who won a lot of money on a quiz show...his former schoolmate surprisingly had known everything about Sweedish Naval History...etc. etc.  But while these character portrayals are quite interesting they don't seem to move Wallander's investigation along very much.    Wallander spends much of his time remembering his youth: discussions with his father, places he had lived, music he had loved, how much he loved his daughter etc.  In short, Wallander is wrapping things up.  His best years are behind him.  But he puts all his remaining energy into solving the von Enke case while he is supposed to be on vacation.    I guess I could say the novel is written on two levels.  In the interests of not revealing the ending..or endings, I won't discuss the content further other than to note that there are more than the usual number of elderly characters in the book.  Every now and again I wished for someone young to pop up.  Of course there is the granddaughter Clara, but all these elderly people thinking about death approaching became a bit trying after a while.  There were also some very funny moments.  It is a novel that will leave you thinking about your own life.
B004GYY714|4.0|i love this app and use it daily.. it has every radio station i can think of. its very easy to use and intuitive. one thing i would like to see is a download option for the podcasts, if i get a glitch on my connection i have to start over, very weak. another feature i would  like to see is replay or rewind on live radio streams. all and all i enjoy app and recommend it to everyone.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I originally saw Resident Evil: Afterlife in the theaters in 3D and it was a very enjoyable experience that I will never forget. I wish that I could have seen it on the big screen once or twice more but as fate would have it, I was not able to. So I was very much looking forward to seeing it again when I bought it on DVD. Although this review is for the standard DVD only, from what I remember, the 3D for this film was awesome on the big screen. I hope to someday see it again in 3D. But the movie is still very good on its own even without the 3D effects.<br /><br />Update: I finally obtained Resident Evil Afterlife on Blu Ray in 3D and let me tell you, this movie looks AWESOME in 3D at home. If you have a 3D TV and a Blu Ray player that can handle 3D disks then do not hesitate to get this movie, it looks amazing! I give it the highest rating and recommendation possible.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed this installment and he did a fabulous job. He is one of my favorite directors and I love most of his films from Mortal Kombat, to Death Race, and this one is one of his best features yet. It is loaded with great action scenes, lots of suspenseful moments, and beautiful slow motion visuals. It also features one of the coolest movie monsters yet in the form of the giant lumbering Executioner monster which carries and swings a ridiculously huge hammer/axe thing at his victims. The Executioner looked awesome in 3D, especially when he would swing and throw his big hammer/axe at the viewer! This movie is a Horror Action/Thriller movie fans dream come true. If you loved Resident Evil Extinction, you will definitely enjoy this film as well. I can't wait to see what they do with the next installment!
B000E5N6LG|4.0|I like this as a companion piece to the more entertaining but less historically accurate Tombstone. Thought Quaid did a  fine job as Holliday and Costner an effective Earp, who was actually probably a lot less likeable than he has been portrayed.
1439133948|5.0|I stumbled upon \\"The Warrior's Apprentice\\" less than 10 years ago, and so was able to read through the entire saga sequentially by good fortune. I then just had to try the author's fantasy book(\\"The Spirit Ring\\") and was delighted that the mechanics of the magic was handled in a matter-of-fact, logical way(nothing spoils an otherwise good yarn than less-than-believeable explanations for what's happened). This approach also works with the technology of the far-future galactic society that's the back-ground of the Vorkosigan series, neatly avoiding windy explanations while satisfying the reader's inner science geek.   While eagerly awaiting the next \\"Miles\\" saga installment, I wasn't as bitterly disappointed as some with Bujold's \\"Sharing Knife\\" series as I felt some reviewers were - I feel it's a classic series every bit as good as the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" saga and will be recognised as such in time.    This story starts out in the middle of a scrambling chase scene, like a lot of grand adventures, and then, with flashbacks and extra characters-and points-of-view, mixes things up until swirling everything together to a satisfactory conclusion...then the coda smashes across everyone's complacent expectations with a bitter - if not un-expected - development. And so, here we are again, anxiously awaiting the next Miles story...   I don't feel let down at all that this story doesn't hit the home run in the same fashion as \\"A Civil Campaign\\", although I'm aware that I may be prejudiced in the author's favor. I realize that what we get as we read is the \\"tip-of-the-iceberg\\" that we see of a writer's personality, and so what we see of a really good writer is a lot of experience and knowledge - so respecting that knowledge, instead of simply absorbing the story(as consumers of entertainment) can be rewarding.
B0042MEQVG|3.0|I had been told Eclipse was the best Twilight movie. If by the best, those who hold that opinion, mean more half-naked Jacob, more intense staring deeply into one-another's eyes, more vampire action and kick-butt battle scenes, then they are correct.<br /><br />I found Eclipse to be the darkest and creepiest of the Twilight series. Edward's obsessiveness over Bella is a trait that many a concerned mother has warned her daughter about. And I guess this puts me on Team Jacob by default, but then I'm still left wondering why Bella is such a prize.<br /><br />I will, of course, continue to watch the movies. The story is definitely a compelling one. But girls, Edward's behavior is not exactly a healthy sign to be looking for in a guy.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|i do not understand why i cannot play this game without getting errors like &quot;please resign into your amazon.comaccount&quot; or &quot;amazon app store error.. please redownload your app from the app store&quot;? why do i need to be logged in to amazon?

B004RJMUJO|4.0|Capacitive muli-touch screen really helps,  but this game is really fun regardless.  Gets kinda old without a traditional Arcade mode but still worth a buck.  :)  slice on
B003UESJDS|3.0|We watched this about 3 weeks ago, but, it is so unmemorable, neither my husband nor I can remember anything about it.  We finished it, I know, but it evoked no emotion in us, good or bad.  In order for me to write a review, I'd have to watch it again, and I might just do that some one of these days.  The Blu Ray itself is gorgeous.
B00005QK3W|3.0|Given the number of Beatlesworthy tracks on `Flaming Pie' and `Run Devil Run', this album was a bit of a disappointing return to form--that is, too much strictly MOR (middle-of-the-road).  If you're making a collection of post-1969 Beatlesque/Beatlesworthy material on CD-Rs or iPod, `Lonely Road' is a good pick, especially of you can fade it a bit early to avoid Paul's self-indulgently annoying vocal histrionics at the end. Then there's `Freedom', an add-on. This one was rather inspiring, until Bush and Blair seized upon 9/11 as a pretext for killing tens of thousands of children in Iraq (nobody seems to care about 100,000+ foreign adults slaughtered so I'll not bother mentioning them) and turning the remains of that state into a cauldron of inter-ethnic hatred, as well as an ally of Iran. Paul couldn't possibly have imagined that these leaders had the requisite  imbecility and barbarity for such an assault. As I hear it, the song was merely putting Islamic extremism on alert that the west was not so decadent as to refuse to stand up and protect its vital interests--so beware.
030746363X|5.0|I was dreading going on the Slow Carb Diet.  It sounded miserable.  I love carbs.  I love GARBAGE FAST FOOD.  Like every single day.  But I got so embarrassingly fat for my PERSONAL taste that enough was enough and I got started that day when I weighed myself and it was 248 lbs - when i woke up, after peeing, etc.    That was 10 days ago.  I weighed myself just now in the middle of the day, I've eaten twice today, zero poops, a ton of liquid, and I was 218.  That's 30 lbs. in 10 days.  My BF% has gone down like 4% and my body water % has gone UP 3% so I'm not just losing water here folks.    My binge day was HORRIBLY OVER THE TOP.  I've cheated 3 out of the last 4 days total actually, with 2 gigantic fast food meals one of the days.  I should add that after the SCHEDULED cheat day which made me feel like total garbage, put me in a food coma and I literally had double vision... I gained all the weight back.  2 days later it was all gone and then some.  Then came cheat day #2 (unscheduled), added a few lbs. but again lost THAT and then some.      Exercise?  The total amount of exercise I've done over the course of these 10 days is as follows.  20 minutes in the gym, 5 pathetic sets on the ASSISTED PULLUP MACHINE, and 5 sets of reverse crunches.  That's it.  The rest of the time I have spent on my ass.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Review based on DIRECTOR'S CUT.<br />As GROUND HOG DAY made use of Nietzche's idea of the \\"Eternal Recurrance\\", DONNIE DARKO uses Nietzsche's ideas of \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" -- using terms of the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze): \\"Fear and Love\\". Nietzsche thought that life experiences are too variegated to simplistically interpret as being either fully good or fully evil, and this is the critique that Donnie says to his teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) during the \\"Fear / Love\\" class exercise. Now, as far as plot structure, and where reality begins and ends... It seems that [PLOT SPOILER] Donnie is destined for tragedy, but gets a chance, through some odd combination of divine intervention and time travel, to save the world from the day of destruction. He is led in this by the Rabbit figure, Frank (James Duval), who could be Christ/angel/demon. The events cannot be interpreted simply as good or evil: [PLOT SPOILER] Burning the house down seemed evil (fear-based), but the result was good (an act of love) because the porn ring-leader was busted. [PLOT SPOILER] The scene with Donnie and Frank in the movie theatre: Frank reveils his eye wound (from when Donnie later shot him), but appears fine at the end of the movie. A risen Christ figure? [Going back and reading some of the reviews, there are some who argue that Donnie IS the Christ figure since he sacrifices himself to save others. I'm sticking with Frank, however, because Frank has the Christlike knowledge and power. \\"Jesus will walk with me down through the valley...\\" Frank was there for Donnie, just as Christ is there for us. Any sacrifice Donnie makes is done in imitation of Christ -- a disciple following his master.]<br /><br />Then again, it could simply be a case of possession, either demonic possession or possession by the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />WWDDD? What Would Donnie Darko Do? Ever since watching this movie, whenever I get an urge to do something maybe not completely rational -- something impulsive -- I see Donnie shouldering his axe with his heart glowing.
0670022411|5.0|This book was amazing. I enjoyed watching the characters grow and learning about things in history I was not aware of. It moves fast but creates every detail of personality, smells and tastes in the scenes, as well as emotions.  I needed something to read and relax with but ended up with an book I couldn't put down. I get little time to read and enjoy it when I can.  I am so glad I spent the little free time I had on this book! Thank you Ms Harkness!
0061906220|3.0|this book is very clever..i do think that the message of color mixing is misrepresented unnecessarily...it could have been more accurate so that it teaches more real lessons about color mixing...but it is a fun song/story....
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This is excactly what I was looking for!  I was concerned that my iphone with the otter box would be too heavy to support on this device.  I was wrong.  It works perfectly!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I expected to hate this because I read a bad review but it was all a lie.  This movie was amazing!  It was truly a sequel. TRON in the 80's introduced life as a concept in the digital world.  This continues with that to have life growing in the digital world and entering our world.  It adds to the original movie by introducing the concept of us in a way being programs.  It was amazing!  I'm so glad they are making another one!  I am so buying this on blu ray!
B004LSO6YI|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The two lead actresses have a convincing and evocative chemistry which sizzled.  The story line was plausible as well; love found, tested, lost and recovered. The only stagnant portion of the film was the documentary style testimonies on soulmates which seemed trite and insincere in comparison to the storyline of two women falling in love.  Fortunately, this is a small flaw and the power of the two leading ladies' performances is undiminished.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Bought this for my niece, she loves it.  She is 6 years old and loved getting something in the mail.  Fast delivery.
159420229X|2.0|Moonwalking with Einstein:  The book was interesting to read but Joshua Foer doesn't present anything new.  Much of his recommendations to improve memory power are nothing short of yesterday's news.  I bought the book thinking it offers some sort of ground-breaking research or revolutionary ways of learning to remember.  I was disappointed.
0061777250|5.0|Skeptic at first on the subject, I grudgingly gave this one a read and wasn't disappointed. Dr. van Lommel gives a damn good read with accounts both pro and con on the subject. I recommend.

B004GHYCKW|5.0|I've always been fascinated with PJ Harvey. She is in a class by herself. The only problem that I have with this CD is that it is not long enough. She sings about England and how it has a lot of frayed edges. She sings and plays with passion, and in a musical world of mindless dribble I find her take of the world around her as refreshing. If you haven't listed to any of her music this is as good a place to start as any.

B000002G87|5.0|This album is great. Every single song is amazing. Amazing guitar, awesome everything. If you are wondering whether or not to buy it, JUST BUY IT!!! This album is legendary, for a reason.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I don't watch many movies more than once, so I rarely buy movies to own.  This is one movie I've seen at least five times now.  It seems timeless!
031261246X|5.0|Russinovich hit the mark for a fictional but all too real account of cyber terrorism. From rootkits to viruses to the impact and plan for using these by terrorists to impact modern civilization, it is a gripping story that spans the globe and sheds real insight to what could happen. Highly recommended, this book should be on your must read list.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Amazon's service was outstanding.  The movie was awesome.  The items included in the box set helped me to appreciate the history and the making of the film.  I would recommend the box set edition of The Sound of Music to anyone and everyone.
0756404738|5.0|I would never have suspected I would get hooked on these books (The Help and Girl with the Dragon Tatoo series were my favorite recent books). I just happened to read Day 1 because it was on a Best Reads List and when I requested it at the library, I didn't really know what I was getting -- sort of a more sophisticated Harry Potter. Since Day 1 leaves you up in the air, I moved on to Day 2 --Wise Man's Fear -- almost 1000 pages. Needless to say, I did not get anything done for the 4 days it took me to read it. It was so addictive that now I will be going through withdrawel waiting the next few years for the third sequel!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you liked The Giver, Farenheit 451, Brave New World, Ender's Game, and other similar titles...I think you will like this one too!
0439023483|5.0|This book should not be labled \\"teen fiction\\" as it will keep people who might really enjoy this series from reading them. It is nice to give girls a strong female hero so maybe as an adult female I can identify with her too. This was a great new premise and a book I couldn't put down. I then moved on and finished the next two sequels.
0312600844|5.0|I just finished reading Freedom in two days.  Tried to it down, couldn't.  Jonathan Franzan is a great writer.  This is, by any standards, a great novel, comparable with Dickens or Tolstoy in terms of creating complex characters and then placing them in a world that's a rich portrayal of a contemporary society.  I can't remember the last time a book has affected me so much emotionally. Maybe it's because I'm a liberal college professor living in a conservative area in my 26th year of marriage with a 23-year-old daughter, but this book is unerring in depicting the world around me and the characters I encounter.  Uniting it all is Franzan's vicious and telling, yet, ultimately affectionate and understanding critique of this bizarre form of \\"freedom\\" that has evolved in contemporary America.  The acquisitive selfishness of virtually all his characters above all seems to succeed in making them and those around them unhappy, while destroying nature and society at the same time.  But ultimately there is a flow of hope, hope founded in his character's ultimate ability to find real care and connection with one another because of, not in spite of, their flaws.      So, as a result of reading this novel, I took my wife out to dinner tonight and tried to be exceptionally attentive and affectionate.  Also, I resolved yet again to make a special effort to reach out and befriend those with whom I disagree politically and culturally (I was already into that; might be why I like this novel so much).  The insight here is not new, but needs to be restated in terms of 21st Century America: true freedom lies in connection and acceptance, not narcissistic acquisition and judgement.  And that's true for Prius-driving, latte-sipping liberals just as much as for monster-truck, gun-toting conservatives.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|And I hope to God that they release the main Indiana Jones Trilogy as separate BD releases. I'd really hate to get stuck with having to buy a Box Set of the four Indiana Jones films. I only want Raiders of The Last Ark and Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom. The Last Crusade really stunk, but most especially, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull met with a new low of how Hollywood clutches at straws to sell a movie franchise and to keep a legend alive.<br /><br />Why did they do that awful fourth one? Harrison Ford is old and decrepit these days. The sound man probably had to edit out all his wheezing when he just bent down to pick up his hat. So I can imagine he was struggling a lot with some of the scenes where a stuntman wouldn't work. And that energetic \\"Indiana Jones\\" theme music was ridiculous to hear knowing that Harrison Ford was probably ready to pass out from running so much on the screen.<br /><br />I don't care if the box set of all four movies sell at the same price of only the first two separately, I'd still only buy the first two Indiana Jones movies.
159420229X|4.0|The author does a wonderful job articulating so much of what we take for granted. How do we remember? Why do we so easily access some memories, while others seem unrecoverable. Unlike many people who study a topic, the author throws himself into it without losing his objectivity.
B00000DR5I|5.0|This is one of those albums that people generally enjoy listening to alone. It's not a party favorite unless your party is with a bunch of brain-fried chemical inducers seeking darkness and euphoria and wishing to maintain an even further absence of consciousness, which can be wonderfully amplified by music like this.<br /><br />This is Tangerine Dream's second album from Virgin Records album. And just as good was Tangerine Dream's previous dark dreamscape concept called \\"Phaedra\\" which I would imagine everyone already has if they already own \\"Rubycon.\\" Then a live album called \\"Ricochet\\" came out which didn't chart on the Billboard Top 200 either, but what surprised me was that the next Tangerine Dream album \\"Stratosfear\\" entered the Top 200, all the way up to #158. I am not too particularly fond of \\"Stratosfear\\", but, it's hard to say why some albums chart on Billboard, and that some do not.<br /><br />The Virgin years were Tangerine Dream's most tangible years for being innovative and recognized. Edgar Froese is really the only original member of Tangerine Dream through their entire 40 plus year existence. With over a 100 albums released (including many solo albums from Edgar Froese), I think only Klaus Schulze could possibly have more recorded material.<br /><br />Klaus Schulze was one of the first original members of Tangerine Dream, but quickly left to have his own solo career, and his material is available in many other single albums and various box sets.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like this album \\"Rubycon\\" by Tangerine Dream and if you are looking for more spacey material like this, check out the music of Jean Michel Jarre, Tomita, Klaus Schulze, Mike Oldfield, Steve Roach, and even Vangelis.

B0015DROBO|1.0|Perhaps I am not as intelligent as I thought I was, but the more I tried to follow this book the less I understood.  The pages are filled with complex jargon that it would take a financial expert to understand. I didn't enjoy having to sift through a maze of confusing terminology to get the story. I regret purchasing this book, but as they say to each his own.

B003XF1OJK|5.0|I have never played the game but I love the book.  I have read 6 books in the Series.  Great scifi and action.  One of my favorites and Nylund is the best author in the series of books.
B0041KKYBK|4.0|Great movie. But it will make you wanna throw up or shoot some of the people who are getting away with what happend. It also shows how insignificant we really are in this real life monopoly game. I can only imagine how \\"The Players\\" on Wall Street just laugh at how they can control us and make tons of money off of the middle class with little to no oversight.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great movie well worth seeing. Film, fate, and faith and some serious heart felt dialog make this a movie that will make your heart soar.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book reminded of a combination of Michael Scott's Alchemyst, and Karen Marie Moning's Highlander and Fever series, along with a bit of Twilight thrown in.  Although it took a few chapters to really get going, once I got hooked I couldn't put it down.  The story combines some of my favorite themes and I am anxiously awaiting the next in the series.

0470901071|5.0|Please read this: The new 7th edition CCNA Book by Todd Lammle does not come with an electronic PDF on the CD. I looked all over the books cover and introduction and it never said that there is one, so I emailed Wiley support. They informed me that none of their books will ship with the electronic version from now on, and that if you want the e-book version then you'll have to buy that version. So before you buy this book, make sure you are buying the version you are looking for as Amazon has both versions for sale. I did end up buying both versions myself, and I feel that I've made a great investment. Having said that, the new version of Todd Lammle's CCNA Study Guide makes reading and understanding Cisco a breeze. I have been in the networking field for two years and I finally decided to go for my certification. After reading many forums, I then asked my co-workers, and the name Todd Lammle came up every time as the recommended book and study products from them all.  You can tell from the get-go that Todd Lammle has been in the field himself for a long time, and seeing how he explains the concepts with such clarity, and the specific examples of what is involved in network administration - all helped to expand my hands-on-knowledge and build foundation.  The written labs, exam essentials sections, along with review questions, answers and explanations at the end of each chapter are very convenient to make sure you understand the \\"important exam topics\\".  I like the flash cards on the CD, as well as the bonus exams. I've also noticed extra chapters and a Final Sim Exam on the CD, but I haven't read those yet as I am still learning the basics. Well written, easy to read - I love it! Two thumbs way up on this book!
0316098337|5.0|I am not a literary reviewer. I usually just say \\"That's a great read... I recommend this book... I never really felt compelled before to write a review.     Enough of the reviews written prior to this one give you an idea of what the book is about. Plus, I feel with the way this book is written, to describe any of it, gives away too much.     I will say, as a mother to young son, I felt so much compassion for the characters. I don't believe you would have to be a mother to enjoy or get absorbed into this story, but I think it added to my experience in reading this book.     Donaghue writes so vividly, and her ability to write from the perspective of a 5 year old is brilliant, despite what another reviewer wrote. The resilience of a child, and ability to learn, grasp, and change so quickly is beautifully depicted, as is the love of a mother and a son.     This book is genius, and I can honestly say at this moment, my favorite book. I look forward to reading more by this author!
B002PXCSWS|5.0|how should i begin? this is a movie that captivates me time and time again. i see new details in each showing. i first saw it in widescreen theater, then again on dvd, and finally in the blu-ray version. zhang yimou has accomplished a complicated task in balancing good storytelling with vivid colorful details and good action. this is art in its high form: pure color artistry. if you like tony leung-chiu-wai, you'll be convinced that in this movie, he clearly shows his range. maggie cheung-man-yuk is wonderful as usual. the weakest contribution is probably zhang yi-yi, who only seems to have one face in the whole picture. not surprisingly, she does not have too many roles outside of a few films. if you remember zhang yimou for his wonderful direction at the 2008 olympics ceremonies, this is the movie to re-enforce his standing as china's modern direction with colors. a well-made blu-ray, but it is not without flaws, as some scenes show grain -- at least more than i was expecting to see. however, it's still one of the best addition to my video library.

B001AVCFK6|1.0|So, I got this movie recently, paid a little extra to get the 3 disc version so that I could get the digital copy. Guess what. It's expired as of 11/27/2010. Do they say that anywhere?!?!? Nope. Will Paramount do anything about it? Nope. Now, I don't necessarily blame Amazon for this, since Paramount is knowingly allowing movies to be sold that won't work. (Paramount isn't the only crook, Warner and Sony does the same thing, apparently). Get the cheaper version, save your money.    If it wasn't for my wasting my money, I would have given this more stars, but alas, that is not the case here.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I rarely write movie reviews.  What am I reviewing?  The writing, acting, content of the movie?  That is completely subjective, what one person likes another may dislike.  So am I reviewing the technical quality of the original film, the DVD transfer, comparing one release to another?  Well what if I have a great TV and sound system and another person has a terrible one?  What I see and hear may not be seen and heard by that other person.<br /><br />So this is strictly based on my viewing of The Sound of Music 45th Anniversary Blu-ray disc last night.<br /><br />Perfect in every way!  I have not seen the movie in a long time and the last time was on a TV with a picture tube and listening through the TV's speakers.<br /><br />This viewing made me happy I now have a high resolution widescreen TV and an excellent sound system.  I truly saw and heard things I never knew were in the movie.  I could not be happier that I now own this set.<br /><br />The most amazing moment was at the beginning of the church wedding.  My subwoofer has never gone so low.  But yet the extreme bass was perfectly controlled and clear, with no distortion.<br /><br />This Blue-ray set earns the highest possible rating for pure enjoyment.  Let someone else discuss the writing, acting, techie details about the transefer, etc.

B00003CX9E|3.0|Stylistically, you can probably go to your local theater today and see something done in one of the movies that is directly inspired by (or in a lot of cases, directly stolen from) Citizen Kane.  The same has probably been true for many of the better movies ever made since this one came out.  It is worshiped by every critic, director, producer and actor out there.    So why do people hate it so?  Simple.  It's because it's all style and no substance.  While something can be found in most every great movie that you can connect to, it's just not there in this movie.  Like everyone else, I saw all the movie lists and wondered what it is about this movie that people liked so much.  But watching it left me wondering that much more.  It just doesn't draw the viewer in.  The interviewees are all wooden and predictable, and Welles himself is just someone with an enormous ego playing...someone with an enormous ego.  I didn't feel for Kane, I didn't relate to him and in the end I just didn't care.    To this day, the greatest danger in making or watching an \\"Oscar-worthy\\" film is mixing enough style in with the substance.  In most cases, there is a failure with that; it's usually too heavy on style and pretense to support the substance.  Citizen Kane, to me, is the perfect example of how soul-less Oscar-worthy films can be.  Part of it is that Kane was, in the end, soulless, but it didn't get there without a lot of help.  It's impossible not to appreciate everything it's done for film-making since, but that is not enough of a reason for me, at least, to consider this in my top ten.
B00011RPB0|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. He watched it first and even though he is not one to rewatch movies (with rare exceptions), he thought I might like this and we watched it together and loved it.  There are many things I loved, but what struck us both was how REAL and genuine the moments are.  It is a subtle movie.  The fact that we can watch an aging movie star and the wife of a celebrity photographer as they stay in a luxury hotel in Japan--experiences neither of us have remotely had--and totally identify with them and recognize familiar moments makes this movie special.  It reminded us of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in ways we could not articulate, so it was interesting to see that these two movies are often purchased together.  This movie made me want to visit Japan and is one I will revisit again and again.
0525421033|5.0|If I Stay is a powerful moving novel unlike anything you have ever read. There have been other emotional novels, but Gayle is the master of bringing you inside the mind and memories of her characters.<br /><br />Last time I read this book was more than a year ago. I am reading it now to remind myself the details before I start Where She Went, but its funny how much I remember. A couple of pages in and it all starts coming back and I am dreading the emotion I will feel once I flip this page. Mia's pain, her family's pain, Adam's pain... I will always remember. That's how great of a writer Gayle Forman is. Mia, her family and friends, are no longer characters in a book. They are people that have been struck by tragedy, and as I read I grieve with them,<br /><br />Mia's family is one of my favorite literary families. They are not just blood. They are one unit. So you can imagine the pain Mia feels being separated from them. When I picture Mia and her family, they couldn't be more different, but they have so much love between them.<br /><br />And Adam, oh Adam, his love for Mia isn't instantaneous. It grows from a mutual love for music and admiration. I love that the romance wasn't perfect, it was sweet and genuine. And the way he interacts with her family, I need a guy like that in my life.<br /><br />As if I didn't love the story enough, the writing is what seals the deal. This is a unique story, but it wouldn't be what it is without Gayle's writing. It is witty, super smart, and haunting. She creates images using words and not because she describe every little detail. She creates images of human emotion and that connects with the readers the most.

0525422943|5.0|I thought I loved Adam in the first book, but I never connected fully until I felt his pain, anger, and frustration in this book. I now understand how Mia's choice affected others in her life. The choice was never the easy part, but you never realized the after would be this hard.<br /><br />Adam has changed since Mia's accident and their subsequent break up. He is bitter, angry, and all of a sudden superstitious to the point he almost seems a little crazy. At first I was like who is this guy? What happened to him? And then you learn more and more about what has happened since we last saw Mia and Adam. In a short span of time Adam lost Mia, Mia's family, and his love of music. I feel his hurt, and I begin to cry for a whole different reason than If I Stay. Frustration and regret can eat a person till all that is left is a hollow shell. That was Adam at the beginning of this book.<br /><br />A beautiful journey and a perfect companion to If I Stay. Adding both of these books to my favorite shelves.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I recently moved to Thailand to teach and there is little to watch in English on t.v. I overheard some co-workers discussing how funny the show is, so I bought the first season DVD. It is so funny I finally had to stop eating while watching to avoid choking, so I bought the other two seasons. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to download season 4 to my PC. I've watched all three seasons several times and it still makes me choke on food, but I suppose eventually I'll get tired of it and stop laughing. Hasn't happened yet, though.
B000001FO4|5.0|In 1988 Cinderella released their sophomore record Long Cold Winter, the album was much anticipated following the incredible debut album, Night Songs. Long Cold Winter is easily Cinderella's most complete record of their career. the entire album is solid, and every song could have been a potential hit on rock radio.<br /><br />From the beginning of Long Cold Winter, the listener gets the feeling Cinderella wanted to distance themselves from every other hair band of the time. The album is far more drenched in the blues than your averager hair metal record, and Tom Kiefer's whiskey-soaked vocals deliver a powerful spine-tingling performance second to none. The enitre record is perfect no doubt, but my favorite songs are Gypsy Road, The Last Mile, Don't Know What You Got (Till It;s Gone), Coming Home, Fire And Ice and Bad Seamstress Blues / Fallin' Apart At The Seams, which is probably top-three one of my favorite Cinderella songs ever.<br /><br />Long Cold Winter is easily one of the best of the genre, and I have a very hard time believing anyone hard rock fan would not love this. A great record from start to end, Long Cold Winter deserves greater respect than it's ever been given, and hopefully this review will help that cause.

B004A8ZWT2|3.0|I think this movie was average, especially considering the big name actors. The plot was ok and the twist at the end was not really well planned out. I think usually when a movie has a major plot twist you can go back and find the clues hidden through the movie. In this movie I believe there was really no hints or evidence to show that the twist was happening. I also think that Depps character role was weak for the quality of actor that he is.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I love the Potter movies but this one just seemed like a badly abridged version of the book. Maybe it is because Half Blood Prince is the first Potter book I read and the book is bound to be better than the movies, but I dont think that is the case here. Voldemort's childhood and how Dumbledore uses the pensive to travel back in time to see his parents and then meet the young boy at the orphanage himself was just amazingly fleshed out and detailed, capitvating and descriptive in the book. Reading through how Voldemort came to be was fascinating and it allowed the audience to grasp the troubled past he endured, the darkness he exhumed and the demons that haunted him so early on eventually rendering him the person he became. There is suddenly an entire human side to Voldemort never seen before and that was powerful. But the movie missed through all these details and just rushed through it. The lake scene was pretty cool - but again in the book it was just so much more eerie than in the movie. I dont think anyone who hasnt read the book will truly understand the artistic mastery that went into creating this work of art; and it really is a work of art: Rowlings outdid herself on this one. I was captivated until the last word and i dont like fiction books.     They should have made this movie into two parts, just like with The Deathly Hollows. I must I admit I still liked it because I love Harry Potter and the visualization of the world of Harry Potter, but I think they could have done a much better job on this one especially because now, after reading all the Potter books, I believe The Half Blood Prince is THE best book in the series. Even better than The Hollows and they were pretty awesome.

0316069353|5.0|I don't like seeing all these poor reviews relating to the kindle price of this book. Yes the kindle version costs more than the print version, and I agree that there is a problem with that. However the poor rating may keep people from reading and enjoying this book. And its a great read, as one would expect from Michael Connelly. I purchased the kindle version, I'm not crazy about paying more for the electronic version, however, I have arthritis in my hands and holding a hardback book for long periods of time is uncomfortable for me so the the kindle price is worth it. In addition the fact that the electronic version in better for the enviornment than the paper version is another plus, why kill trees if you don't have to.  So get a grip guys, if you don't want to pay the price wait for it to hit the used book stores, don't put down a great read because of the kindle price.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. It starts of with Brittany the popular girl in the entire school she's white, blond, and the captain of the cheerledeader / pom pom team and has the high school quarterback as her boyfriend. Her life is perfect to the outside world damn I even thought her life as well perfect. I mean can life get any better than that? Well once you get into the book you will find her life is not perfect as it seem and her world turns upside down when she is stuck with Alex the intimate high school bad boy who is also in a gang as her lab partner in senior year. I am not a huge fan of romance but I really like this book. It talk about not giving up on your dreams, finding out who your real friends are, how to love your siblings, stop trying to be perfect and be yourself, breaking out of your comfort zone and trying something different and new, and most importantly that opposites attract. This is an awesome book you'll love it. I know I did.

0375757813|5.0|*Mansfield Park* is somewhat quixotic. It is at the same time one of my favorite, and one of my least favorite, books of all time. It is a beautifully-written tale of love, kindness, and strength of character, rising above adversity and winning the day for the heroine. It is also a tale of unspeakable emotional abuse of the heroine by nearly everyone else for some half of the book, and most others for nearly the entire story.<br /><br />The book begins with the tale of three sisters who had a falling-out. Two of them married well enough that the one after her husband's death was still upper-middle class, while the other was quite wealthy. The third sister married a lower-class man whose inability to provide much economically for his new wife, lead to a furious disagreement that never quite heals. Eventually, the poorer sister, Mrs. Price, after having a large number of children, appealed to her sisters desperately for help.<br /><br />The help came in the form of an offer to take one of the daughters into the family of the wealthier sister as a ward. While this may seem ideal to most folks to be removed for near-poverty to opulence, it had a serious drawback for the young girl named Fanny Price. She spent her days either being ignored by most of her relations, or outright abused by others. Particularly, the widowed sister was a bitter woman who clearly hated her other sister still, for her treatment of Fanny is horrendous.<br /><br />And trust me, I really *do* mean *horrendous*. I found myself shocked and angered as I read, though I am aware that these are just literary characters. Shocked and outraged because I know this almost certainly happened in real life to these children. What the wealthy clan, the Bertrams, did for Fanny seems to have been common practice at the time, as probably was the abuse in all too many situations.<br /><br />This is the strength and weakness both of the novel. Jane Austen takes her same skill at wit and satire that she employed to write the bantering romance of Darcy and Lizzie in *Pride and Prejudice*, and uses it to tell a story of triumph over incredible adversity. I found myself simultaneously drawn into the narrative and wanting to put the book down because of how vivid the world of young Fanny was, with all of it's attendant triumphs and horrors, pleasures and abuses.<br /><br />There seems to be a rather large, and quite sickeningly stunning to me, number of people who don't like the character of Fanny, because of her perceived \\"weakness\\". They seem to view the fact that Fanny is not assertive and takes the abuse as evidence of her unlikable \\"wimpiness\\". To be sure, they have *might* have a point, but for the fact that they obviously had not paid attention to the overall narrative of the story.<br /><br />What I mean by this is that it was not just Fanny's more gentle nature that lead to her lack of assertiveness, but her treatment at the hands of her relations, especially the complete monster of an aunt that she had in the abusive Mrs. Norris. She was a girl who knew and was constantly told her place, and she was certainly too scared to cross that line in the sand. She pretty much did what she was told to do, including being treated like the servant of her aunts and daughters, and accepted being told how worthless she was.<br /><br />Despite all of this, however, she had the strength of character to refuse to do anything that may have compromised her principles. She had a clearly developed worldview and sense of right and wrong. This enabled her to make the correct decisions while most of her family made horrible decisions that caused much harm. In the end, Fanny became the apple of her wealthy uncle (Sir Thomas Bertram) and aunt's eye. As well she was the apple of the eye all along of her future husband.<br /><br />For those who wonder, yes I'm being vague. Given the status of the story as a novel of romance and manners, too much more detail may literally give the entire plot away fromthe start, which I do not wish to do. I do wish to say what is good in this story. And what is bad.<br /><br />To be honest, there is hardly anything bad to be told. The book is hard to read for the sorrow and abuse of the heroine, but that is part of the plot that weaves together a story of ultimate triumph over adversity. The one and only drawback that I can put to the plot is how the heroine has a long tale of tumult and adversity with most of the novel's length dedicated to that, but only a few pages dedicated to her triumph and happiness. Do not get me wrong, I am happy about the ending and it did not disappoint. It was truly and deeply satisfying. I just would have liked a longer ending with more happiness explored. It would have been even *more* satisfying.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the story is a compelling novel that teaches the reader an important lesson. You see, outside strength does not matter as much as inner character. Give the most fearless man or woman who lack a moral core (which I believe they can only obtain if they trust in the Lord Jesus Christ) enough time, and they *will* cause far, *far* more problems than the less stellar (from the outside) acting or appearing man or woman who have strong moral convictions. Me? I trust those of strong character more. For strong character really is the greatest strength of all.<br /><br />Read this book, even if you have to occasionally put it down because of the intense content, as I had to do. You will not regret it. Highly Recommended.the start, which I do not wish to do. I do wish to say what is good in this story.

0525951652|3.0|Ken Follett is a good story teller. Yet, as other reviewers have noted, in this book (as distinct from the medieval stories), the characters are a little thin. The 'events' to bring the threads of the plot to knit together are at times contrived. The tapestry he weaves is very broad covering the end of the Victorian era to the aftermath of WW I (the start of the socialist era). Perhaps following one main family as the core of the story may have helped, since all of the main Western countries of the period feature in the plot.<br /><br />If you want to read a good yarn and have an interest in the broad relationships and trends - political and social - that occurred at this time, then you will enjoy it. A number of the characters are a bit stereotyped, but this is overcome by the author's readable style. I'll probably buy the next volume in the trilogy.<br /><br />I read this on a Kindle - a lot easier to hold (its a heavy book!) and finished it in a week.<br /><br />Geoff Lambert - author of \\"The Morozov Inheritance\\"

With this release, they have done all they can do (electronic, atmospheric soundscapes with wistful/existentialist vocals) with what they've got.  It's good stuff, but for their next project, they will have to go on a different path, or the result will be deadly dull.  I shouldn't review them for what they haven't yet done, but KOL is their (hopefully) turning point. Recommended.

B004ETVAH0|5.0|This is a fantastic honest musical experience, held in the NY club once the domain of the late Les Paul once a week in his later days. Jeff Beck displays more of his guitar skills as he weaves sounds around the various vocalists, especially the girl singer emulating the late Mary Ford using one of Les Paul's invention of double tracking the harmonies as the act once performed. Guitars are plenty, not just Strats but a Telecaster, Les Paul Standard and more. This club-like experience highlights a bygone era that Les Paul and Mary Ford performed so well in. This is a fine tribute to fashionable music of the era prior to and leading into Rock and Roll in the 50s. I especially love the brass section (normally not my thing) with the theme from Peter Gun, and when was the last time you heard Apache done expertly as the Shadows once did. Rock and Roll is the real winner here, the a rhythm section to die for .... a great night captured on tape (or digital media .... sound so cold 'digital'?)

B0010ZR160|5.0|It's unusual for a movie to be better than the book. This was the case, however, with Gone Baby Gone. Casey Affleck was genius acting in it as was his brother (Ben Affleck) in directing it. The cast was stellar in their portrayal of the characters. You know a movie is excellently scripted when you find yourself thinking about it and discussing it long, long after it's over. Makes you wonder:  in a question that typically yields a black or white answer, what happens when you're forced to contend with the gray? Who was right and who was wrong in the end? You'll find yourself vacillating between the two. Excellent movie.
0385751893|4.0|I first began reading The Boy In The Striped Pajamas for fun and realized how hard it is to find a well-written novel that not only ties into your content area, but one that connects to your students' interests. After reading the first chapter, I knew this was the book for my students. I teach English as a Second Language (8th grade) and we just finished The Boy in The Striped Pajamas by John Boyne. I was skeptical about using this book with my middle school students because of the harsh realities that occurred during the Holocaust, but knew it was a very serious topic that complemented my unit on discrimination.         The Boy In The Striped Pajamas tells the story of a young, curious boy by the name of Bruno. He lives in pre-war Germany with his loving mother, SS Commandant father, and older sister Gretel.  Bruno and his family are relocated to the countryside. They are moving so father can control a Nazi concentration camp. Bruno doesn't understand why they are truly moving. He thinks they are moving because of father's job and doesn't understand what the job entails. Shortly after their move, Bruno explores a nearby forest and after a bit of exploring, comes across a young boy. The young boy is identified as Shmuel and is dressed in striped pajamas behind a fence. Bruno finds it interesting that Shmuel happens to be on the other side of a high electric fence. They share stories from time to time. Bruno doesn't understand why Shmuel and the others are separated from the rest of the world and often starts bringing him food. They quickly form a friendly relationship and look forward to seeing each other every afternoon. Shmuel mentions that he needs to find his father because he is nowhere to be found. It all begins to crumble when Bruno finds out that Shmuel is a Jew. Bruno is ordered not to visit Shmuel anymore because Jews were considered inferior for certain reasons. The book closes with Bruno becoming curious and wanting to help Shmuel locate his father. He decides to go against his parents' orders to not visit Shmuel anymore. The next day he decides to dig a hole under the fence. Bruno plans on helping Shmuel find his father. Bruno sees starvation, dehumanization, and sickness when visiting the other side of the fence. Back at the house, Bruno's mother noticed that Bruno was missing and began searching for him. Back at the concentration camp, Bruno and Shmuel are caught up in a line of men being lead to the gas chambers. The last thing in the movie is Bruno and Shmuel removing their clothes and holding hands.       I am only recommending this book if you plan on pre-teaching some important events and vocabulary that took place during World War ll. This sensitive novel is appropriate for most 8th grade students and brings up some powerful class discussions. It is often difficult for young adults to read literature without any prior knowledge on this topic. I chose to use this book with my mature, advanced, second language learners for many reasons. Many of them were able to relate this book back to their own lives considering most of them went through some type of physical, mental, and emotional trauma when living in their home countries. Many of their parents and family members were murdered. It leads to many teaching opportunities of tolerance, separation, social justice and respect for others. It's one of the many stories that reflect innocent human beings being forced to flee their homes and communities because of ignorant people.

B002ZG993Q|1.0|I guess some people will think my review isn't fair, but this was so freakin' boring I couldn't finish it. With all the hype and great \\"reviews\\" on the box I was expecting something exciting and suspenseful or at least entertaining. Nope. Don't waste your money buying this. Rent it from the library or watch it online if you have some time to waste.

Cleared up my understanding of some of the concepts that I thought I knew right. If Java is your first programming language, read this first. Kathy and Bert Rock!
B0002F6AZC|5.0|I think this is just as good as the original, even though this movie didn't have as much money as the first movie, hence the three stories unlike the first which had five.  Other than that, this a great 80's horror flick with a decent amount of ectras, which the original version, or even the Blue-ray version of the original Creepshow did not have.  Two thumbs way up!!!
0307591549|5.0|Having already read Tal Ben-Shahar's The Pursuit of Perfect: How to Stop Chasing Perfection and Start Living a Richer, Happier Life as well as Jessica Pryce-Jones' Happiness at Work: Maximizing Your Psychological Capital for Success, and having absorbed and digested what their authors share, I was curious to know what (if anything) new Shawn Achor could contribute to the on-going multi-logue and how well the material is organized and presented. My rating correctly indicates what I think he has accomplished. Others have their own reasons for admiring this book. Here are two of mine.<br /><br />First, Achor introduces seven principles that serve as the foundation of what he characterizes as \\"the happiness advantage\\": positive brains have a significant biological advantage over brains that are neutral and an even more substantial biological advantage over brains that are negative. In fact, The Happiness Advantage\\" also serves as the first principle, followed by<br /><br />2. The Fulcrum and the Lever: How a positive mindset (fulcrum) can leverage power to achieve success (however defined)<br /><br />3. The Tetris Effect: How that same positive mindset can recognize can recognize patterns of possibility that leads to possibilities that would otherwise be missed<br /><br />4. Falling Up: When experiencing a major crisis or encountering a major threat, how selecting the right mental \\"path\\" will reveal the best course of action to take<br /><br />5. The Zorro Circle: When coping with crisis or threat, how to control emotions \\"by focusing first on small, manageable goals, and then gradually expanding our circle to achieve progressively bigger ones\\"<br /><br />6. The 20-Second Rule: When willpower weakens or fails, how to make small adjustments of energy to reroute the path of least resistance with better habits and renewed willpower.<br /><br />7. The Social Investment: When challenged or threatened, \\"how to invest more in one of the greatest predictors of success and excellence - our social network support.\\"<br /><br />These principles guide and inform Achor`s narrative as it proceeds to Part Three when he shares his suggestions about how to spread \\"the happiness advantage\\" at work, at home, and beyond.<br /><br />I also commend Achor on his brilliant analysis of situations with which almost all of his readers can readily identify and then on his equally brilliant explanation of how to take full advantage of such situations by viewing them as opportunities rather than as threats. Almost immediately (in the Introduction, he establishes and then sustain a direct, personal, indeed conversational rapport with his reader. The tone of the narrative is enriched by a spirit I characterize as \\"There will definitely be some questions to answer and problems to solve but don't worry. Hey, we're in it together.\\" Presumably the rapport that Achor establishes with his reader very closely resembles the rapport he established with Harvard students years ago. That is great news for readers, especially for those who in greatest need of what this book offers.<br /><br />Almost 20 years ago in an commencement speech at Stanford and then in an article published by Harvard Business Review, Teresa Amabile offered the best career advice I ever heard: Love what you do and do what you love. Perhaps the greatest challenge for any company is to make certain that those who supervise its workers get what they do best and enjoy most in alignment with achieving the company's goals. Recent research studies by highly reputable firms such as Gallup and TowersWatson reveal that happy workers (i.e. who love what they do and do what they love) work harder and smarter, completing their work \\"faster, better, cheaper.\\"<br /><br />For business leaders in organizations of which that cannot be said now, Shawn Achor's book is a \\"must read.\\"lence - our social network support.\\"<br /><br />These principles guide and inform Achor`s narrative as it proceeds to Part Three when he shares his suggestions about how to spread \\"the happiness advantage\\" at work, at home, and beyond.<br /><br />I also commend Achor on his brilliant analysis of situations with which almost all of his readers can readily identify and then on his equally brilliant explanation of how to take full advantage of such situations by viewing them as opportunities rather than as threats.

0439882826|5.0|I purchased this book through Amazon because of the fabulous video preview. I bought it for my grandson and he loves it! This book is not for little children, as the pop-ups are quite detailed with many bends and folds. My grandson is 7 and is old enough to know that it is a special book and one must be careful when opening and closing the pages. I was with him for 10 days after giving it to him, and he barely put it down to eat and sleep. He had it with him all the time! This is truly a fabulous book for anyone who loves Star Wars. The light-up swords are an especially exciting feature!
0756404738|5.0|Although I hesitate to say it was worth the wait since the wait was so painful, this definitely was. Rothfuss puts out an amazing sequel to an incredible debut and mixes several styles of story within a single book. Kvothe's story, both in the past and present, evolves and grows more complex and left me (pantingly) wanting more.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I have purchased every one of Michael Connelly's books, all in hardcover. I love owning a good book and often read it several times. I am sure this book will be every bit a good as Mr. Connelly's previous books. Starting with this book I will get it from the library. I don't know what costs are involved in publishing a book or the relationship between cost and price but I can't believe it costs as much to produce a digital copy as it does to produce a hardcover book. The alternate rock group \\"Phish\\" controlled the maximum price for their concert tickets. Are there any authors that do something similar? I believe that the publishers are more to blame than the authors as they are the ones who control which books get published. But, in the end, it is the consumer who is really responsible. If we pay the prices set by the publishers, the prices will never go down. I will no longer do that.

This is a yoga book for those who want detailed instruction about how to do nearly every yoga pose and why certain poses are recommended in particular circumstances.

She is a great wrte, very inspirational and courageous. She had tons of courage to do what she did, by leaving her family and running away from a man she didn't even know and was supposed to marry. Thank you, Ali, for your inspiring story!

B002ZG99ZO|1.0|Your Highness is a movie, if there ever is one, that is an insult to the words \\"Gross-out\\" and \\"comedy\\" and the dash between the first two words. What's even more insulting is the fact that it came from such a talented director, David Gordon Green. That guy directed Pineapple Express, and a number of lower-key serious ones that are worth mention as well. But alas, Your Highness is an ultimately unfunny embarrassment of a film that makes the god-awful \\"Step Brothers\\" look hilarious.<br /><br />The film's story is set in Medieval England and basically revolves around Thadeous, a lazy and fat stoner slob with a successful brother, Fabious. Fabious has just returned from saving his wife, Belladonna, from an evil wizard with three moms called Lezarre. As they are about to get married, on the wedding day, Lezarre kidnaps Belladonna and brings her back to his castle for the sole purpose of deflowering her, with the help of his three mothers. They take some guy I couldn't care about named Courtney as they go on their quest. Their quest includes many things such as masturbating a wizard creature thingy, ending up in a trap and blah blah blah... yeah.<br /><br />That's about as much of a story you'll get from Your Highness. Because much of the film's potential to have a good story is wasted on jokes about sex, paedophilia, wearing a monster penis around your neck and a whole bunch of other gross and raunchy stuff that's too raunchy to be funny, and too dull to be even considered humour, even unfunny humour at that. The film basically subjects its audience to such nasty and gross stuff for the entire duration, and while I love gross-out humour, there's a fine line between gross and funny.<br /><br />That's not to say there wasn't any funny moments, because there were, in fact, two: One where Thadeous goes around, stoned out of his mind, chasing sheep, and another being where they are under attack in a ritual including a beast which is controlled by a fat man's hand. I'm not gonna lie, I just spent 20 minutes trying to remember the parts I did think were funny. That's never a good sign. There were a couple chortles as well, but I can't even remember those parts. There's an incredible amount of gory violence in the film too, but the only reason the gore is so shocking is because of the rest of the film being so static and blas&eacute;. Despite the violence, the film is not much of an action movie. Problem is, it's not much of a comedy either, at least to people who know what funny actually means.<br /><br />Overall, while this film is rated 18A in Canada, I find mys elf about 6 years past its intended target audience- that is, 14 year old tweens who find jokes about baby rape and other disgusting stuff funny. And mind you, I've been known around my friends as the one with the incredibly sick and twisted sense of humour, but even still, this film is just not funny. I would definitely recommend staying away from this flick, no matter how much you love gross humour or sick and twisted stuff.minutes trying to remember the parts I did think were funny.

0316017922|3.0|In my opinion, Gladwell's concept is interesting , and I enjoyed reading about the hockey players, the Beatles, the technology giants, etc. who fall into the parameters that fit his concept BUT.... there must be TONS of exceptions to his \\"rules\\" that do NOT  fit his parameters and, to me,this is the great unaddressed flaw which makes his book/his theory both weak and questionable.
B004DK5CYM|4.0|This was a good movie even though everyone probably knows the climax of the movie.  It was extremely well acted and the cinematic adventure was great.  There was a few unneeded lines but otherwise a feel good and happy movie to watch.  Enjoy!
1439102724|2.0|Jodi Picoult has been one of my favorite novelists, until I finished reading Sing you home. Why does a successful novelist decide to alienate a good portion of her readers by portraying the Christian religion in such a harsh bigoted manner? If the intent was to bring light to the plights, issues of the gay community as well as to be more open minded, by setting a negative image of Christianity, it just did not work. It is clear in her portrayal of her characters, including ultimately Max, that the message was to dismiss the Bible, patronize believers and ultimately suggest the right path is one that does not conform to 'conservative' ideology. It is clear what side of the political spectrum Ms. Picoult belongs to.  Unfortuneatly, I would prefer to read a compelling novel with interesting characters rather than a political/religious commentary  of which she has each character sadly realize by the end of the novel. We all love depth and heart wrenching topics but not at the expense of our core beliefs.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating because the corners of the music box were broken.  Since I didn't buy this for the music box, it doesn't matter.  It's nothing that super glue won't fix.

B000PDYVVG|4.0|Ever since it hit bookshelves and surfaced on the scene, I've strayed away from reading Elizabeth Gilbert's \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" thinking it was a revised edition of \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\"; however, I was mistakenly wrong. Gilbert's voice eludes every thought from depression and confusion to happiness and excitement and brings the reader closer to her through every page that depicts her reality and not some Hollywood fantasy tale. We all can't escape to foreign countries to discover our inner self but Gilbert did and took advantage of this rare opportunity by opening her mind, sharing the good and the bad and allowing the reader to learn and grow from her experiences.<br /><br />\\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" isn't a sappy story about a middle-aged woman. It's a memoir of a young woman who wasn't happy with life and decided to do something about it. Regardless if you're fifteen, twenty-five, forty-five, eighty-five...every woman (and man) has something to gain from reading Gilbert's year-long expedition.
B00005KB9X|5.0|This was an album of great transition for Bob, he had split with his childhood friends and original Wailers, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  Bob's influence over the band was becoming more and more pronounced and Tosh and Wailer decided that is not the direction they wished to go.  The revamped band was now, for the first time, known as \\"Bob Marley and The Wailers\\" as opposed to just \\"The Wailers\\" thus solidifying Marley as the primary leader of the band.<br /><br />Bob truly took charge of the overall focus and direction of the group and wrote all the songs.  In an interesting twist of fate and one of the best business moves in music history, he assigned the credits for many of his songs to his close family memebers and friends as a way to make sure they were taken care of financial, certain charities he believed in and supported were funded and as a way to avoid contractual obligations to his former publishing company, Cayman Music.<br /><br />Although this is a transition album of sorts, it sports some of his most memorable songs and one in particular that would be one of his defining moments, \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" which would gain much fame due to his incredible live performances of the record.  He would introduce the \\"I-Threes\\" a female vocal group that included his wife, Rita Marley, Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt.  Their vocals addeded a wonderful compliment to Bob's on songs such as one of my personal favorites on the album, \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\\".  The writing on this album seems very personal and almost takes you on a journey through Bob's life in Jamaica and some of the obstacles he had to overcome.<br /><br />This record is also a canvas for Bob to infuse some of his Rastafarian beliefs and he does a marvelous job of this on songs such as \\"So Jah Seh\\" and the title track \\"Natty Dread\\".  This album is almost like Bob saying \\"Here I Am, The Real Me\\" and he gives us a fairly detailed revelation of where his heart was and where his and the bands focus was now going to be.  I believe this to be one of his most profound works and it's one of my personal favorites.  It's only years after it's release and in particular after his death that I think many truly appreciated this album for it's greatness.<br /><br />There are many wonderful songs beyond \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" that make this a truly wonderful album and it gives it's listener a front row seat into some of the many tragic situations going on in his homeland and, indeed, many of the places dear to his heart such as the other island nations, Africa and United States.  Bob Marley was a revolutionary in every since of the word and he would spend the remainder of his tragically short life fighting for the cause, \\"Revolution\\".s was now going to be.

0316069353|5.0|Mickey Haller, Michael Connelly's \\"Lincoln lawyer\\", is back in \\"The Fifth Witness', an especially entertaining addition to the series. The author skillfully uses the state of the economy, during which criminal defense cases \\"have dried up\\", as the impetus for the action in  the novel.<br /><br />Adjusting to the current economic downturn, Haller refocuses his from criminal defense practice to foreclosure defense. He even hires an associate, Jennifer Aronson, fresh from law school to help with an increasing number of new cases. His ex-wife, Lorna, is still his office manager and still married to his investigator, Cisco. He still uses his Lincoln as a mobile office, riding in the back seat while Rojas, his driver, takes him to see clients and assists with Spanish translations. He worries about money more and more. His fourteen-year-old daughter, Hayley, is in an expensive private school and dreams of attending USC in the all-too-near future.<br /><br />An unexpected call for help from his most visible foreclosure client changes Mickey's new routine and opens the door for him to make some substantial cash. Lisa Trammel, who has become a minor media celebrity and the champion of  people-who-face-losing-their-homes, needs his help.  Lisa has been arrested for the murder of a bank vice-president - the bank that is trying to force her out of her home. Haller rushes to the rescue, being sure to get Lisa to sign agreements designating him as her defense attorney and as her representative in negotiating book, movie, and similar deals.<br /><br />Haller will earn any money he makes from the case and media deals because he finds himself dealing with a sleazy Hollywood producer, a sleazy mortgage mill, sleazy thugs, and a client who is an egomaniac-nightmare. And that's not to mention the prosecutor, a savvy DA who has more than one trick up her sleeve and a more than strong will. Meanwhile, Mickey's heart still belongs to Hayley's mother, Maggie, from whom he seems destined to remain divorced.<br /><br />Smooth writing, tense scenes in and out of the courtroom, characters who are more than they seem, and a twist at the conclusion make this one of Connelly's best Haller books. A bonus is Connelly's explanation of the basics of mortgages, foreclosures, and how the home loan situation became such a mess.<br /><br />Don't let being unhappy at the price of the novel - either the hardback or the Kindle version - stop you from reading this excellent legal thriller.  The public library is the place to get books for free, so go, put your name on the check-out waiting list, and enjoy.Smooth writing, tense scenes in and out of the courtroom, characters who are more than they seem, and a twist at the conclusion make this one of Connelly's best Haller books.

0525422943|5.0|In the sequel to If I Stay, we find that Mia and Adam have gone their separate ways.  Adam has his own rock band Shooting Star and he is dating a movie star.  He is on a whirlwind tour.  Mia is having success of her own at Julliard.  Three years have passed since they were last together.  Adam finds himself stranded in New York.  He and Mia meet by chance.  This is the opportunity for us to see the Adam we knew still existed under the many layers of the new Adam.  The two of them begin opening up old wounds that will help them begin a true healing process.  The reader is taken on an emotional roller coaster ride, or at least I was.  For me this book was more intense and more enjoyable than the first book.  It seems funny to say that because I really, really loved the first book.  Where She Went has the raw emotion that makes you hang in there rooting for this couple.  This is a book I could see myself reading again and definitely recommending to others.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|Mr Big is back and in fine form! For anyone who liked Mr. Big in the 90s, this is a must-have album. Soulful vocals, interesting melodic progressions, tight rhythms, searing leads, tasteful ballads - this has it all. Mr. Big hasn't put out a bad album to date, but this is definitely one of my top two.<br /><br />I'm very glad to see Mr Big back with the original lineup. This album is somewhat different from \\"Bump Ahead\\" (arguably their best album before breaking up)  in feel and mix; more rocking songs, less ballads.  Reasonable diversity, too - Undertow is a great straight-ahead rock anthem; Stranger In My Life is a poignant ballad with a great, albeit simple, guitar solo; I Won't Get In My Way has a bit of a progressive / STP vibe to it, Around the world is a blast from the past, in a good way....<br /><br />The songs bring in a variety of influences - some sections remind me of ZZ Top, in other places, Led Zeppelin... there's a bit of old school Van Halen in there too.<br /><br />Production quality is very good too.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I steered away from \\"Room\\" for months, despite Amazon recommending over and over that I should read it. Finally, I gave in and within the first sentence, I was hooked.<br />Recent events, such as the Jacyee Duggard saga come to mind and was possibly the inspiration. \\"Room\\" is told from the point-of-view of five year-old Jack who was born and raised his whole life (all of 5 yrs) in a single room. Unbeknownst to Jack until later in the book, Jack's mother was kidnapped when she was nineteen and has been held captive in this shed, located in the backyard of her capture's house. For the past eight years, she's been held captive and for the past five years, she's created a world for her son Jack that is a fun, educational and safe haven. Because Room is all Jack has known, objects within his area are not just objects but his friends. Room is a person to him, just like Table, Rug, Bath and Spoon. Author Emma Donoghue's use of personification and ability to speak through a captive five year-old is brilliant.<br />The subject matter of \\"Room\\" is dark and depressing; however, the plot and outcome of the story are very interesting and introspective. It's real, it's deep and that's what makes it a 5-star read.

B003UESJF6|3.0|Megamind is a fun and silly experience.  This is pure fun and I love the concept of what happens when the super villain actually wins.  The downfall is that it can lead to a labored and boring plot which lacks focus and can seem tedious and boring.  The great flaw in this movie is that it is too mopey and doesn't have the wry humor of a Toy Story or makes us see more about our self like Wall-E does. Megamind ranks more like a half baked romantic comedy then a wired over the top     I also think this movie could have benefited more from Will Ferrall's edgy brand of humor.  He was so muted here as to be almost invisible. The obtuseness of Megamind was funny for a while but it went dry very quickly. I think this is a cute movie but I have to say I think it could have been funnier.
0743454537|4.0|You'll cry, laugh, and then cry all over again with this book.  I thought overall, this book was just so sad.  Cancer is horrible though and something very hard to deal with, and it's a part of life.  In dealing with the disease, I think this book was written very true to life, and I couldn't imagine myself in the family's spot.  The ending took me by surprise and I hated it, because it was just sad.  There is a love story thrown in, which I kinda think was written lamely.  Not the best.  Overall, I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.  Very well written, so sad, yet also heart warming, but some things, such as the love story between the lawyer and guardian ad litem, I rolled my eyes at.
B004NSULHM|5.0|No need to listen \\"hundreds\\" of times to get the depth out of the album.  As I've written elsewhere, I was jarred at first by the new sound, but after listening to the whole thing a couple of times through, the melodies started sticking in my head and it just clicked.  I found myself singing snippets even when the music wasn't playing and realizing that I actually liked every song I'd heard, none of them irked me, and I appreciated that they were still making music -- which I hope they continue to do for a good long time!!    Give it a shot.  For the download, it's only six dollars for crying out loud...
0307477479|1.0|I bought this book after high praise from many people and I am regretting the purchase. It is terrible, dis-jointed, depressing book. The characters are poorly developed, the stories do not make sense and rely on shock value through the tawdry story lines. I cannot believe so many people liked this book. I read A LOT and this is probably the worst book I've ever read.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Both Republicans and Democrats get well-deserved beatings in this well-researched and presented film on the ways in which the financial industry recklessly -- one could argue, purposely (they knew there'd be a crash but didn't care as long as they got rich) -- drove the world economy into the ground in 2008 and thereafter. Sadly, all of it was predicted by thoughtful and decent economists throughout 2005 through 2008 before the crash of September, 2008, some of whom appear in the film. Eerily, these same people now predict another collapse soon from out-of-control spending and deficits that not enough politicians take seriously enough.    The film documents that the same bad Wall Street players and policies are still at work, with the only difference being that there is now more power concentrated in even fewer \\"too big to fail\\" banks and so-called hedge funds. At the heart of the relentless Wall Street evils are corrupt bonuses-for-volume-sales compensation incentives that nobody in the U.S. wants to regulate (though the EU is doing so), and the criminal \\"ratings\\" bureaus. Worse, instead of going to jail for fraud and theft, the major players of the 2008 crisis were/are handsomely rewarded and now have the top finance jobs in the Obama Administration. Some Hope. Some Change.

B003E6K1VK|4.0|UPSHOT (2 years on)... this is a great compact package that does what DAC does best at an affordable price. My nephew loves it and keeps borrowing it for use with his notebook, have recently retrieved it and yes it does make some difference on my (already quite good) system.<br /><br />Works its notable charm (can't say magic) on old LP rerecordings, evens off any jarring edges without compromising distinctness, and makes for great easy listening without hearing fatigue.<br /><br />Between this and the FiiO9, get this first.  If you are a low volume listener then you do't need the 9, but if you are a rocker then E7 sits snugly in E9 for a complete package.<br /><br />==================================================================================================<br />REVISED & UPDATED<br />==============<br />[Just out of the box...] The touch & feel and finish of the product is solid and I love the fact that fiio thinks of everything providing you with a screen protector and silicon glove jacket etc. Good instruction sheet.<br /><br />During the first 20hrs of burn, I could not discern any improvement in sound quality on my K702 amped by fiiO E7 and driven from iPod Classic - if anything, I thought there was a slight drop in sound clarity and separation. I was already very happy with the K702 unamped as the signature suited 95% of my music repertoire which comprised largely accoustic, tenors, mid vocals, etc.<br /><br />What the E7 did however was to raise maximum volume by 10% which was irrelevant for me as I had found maximum volume driven from the iPod quite sufficient for my K702. [Max iPod Volume = 53/60 E7 Volume) Ditto the iPhone 3GS. Setting the EQ Bass boost to +1, also improved bass presence in rock music eg U2, BonJovi & Black Eyed Peas. It afforded elegant ambient bass, adapting the sound signature of the K702 for listening to genres with more bass (but not heavy metal)  Happier now ...<br /><br />However, whilst there is a plus(+) I also found a minus (-)...after jiggling the LOD jack (1/8\\") several times in and out of the E7 Line In Receptor (bottom right), I suddenly found that connection was compromised and needed to be tweaked each time for optimum sound or it toggles between stereo and a hollow distant mono sound with parts missing.  Does anyone else have the same issue.  I am a very careful person btw. A little disappointed in that considering its $99 and not $59. - **UPDATE Nov 19 AEST: The culprit appears to be the LOD L3 cable with shonky wires, as the E9 manifested the same poor connection using the same L3 cable.**<br /><br />Apart from that my compliments to the design team - you've done well.

1891252089|5.0|This spiral-bound and beautifully illustrated, explicitly explained and annotated instruction manual (but far, far more than just an instruction manual) is hands-down the best and only book a practitioner needs on the beginning and intermediate series of the Ashtanga practice.<br /><br />Although David Swenson was not certified by Sri K Pattahbi Jois, it doesn't affect his ability to teach in person or on the page. I had the pleasure of attending one of his workshops in his adopted city of Austin, and his regard and humility toward every single student--no matter their understanding (or lack thereof) of Ashtanga, was an investment that remains with me and my adherence to this book.<br /><br />The best way to start out learning the practice of Ashtanga yoga is by personal, led instruction in a classroom. I recommend a sold background in hatha yoga and familiarity with the basic asanas, including Suyra Namaskara A &B (Sun Salutations), Ado Mukha Svanasana, Urdhva Mukha Svanasana, (Downward and Upward-facing Dog), Virabhadrasana (I-III), Trikonasana, and others of the standard and oft-used asanas. My use of the Sanskrit is not to show off my linguistic talents, but to emphasize that Ashtanga Yoga does not use the English names to illustrate their asanas (poses). The Sanskrit names are actually more than a phonetic term. They help you to go deeper into the poses--something understood as you practice.<br /><br />I am always sorry to hear people shy away from yoga because they think that they can't perform the pretzel poses or they worry that they have no flexibility. The truth is--yoga, which means means \\"yoke\\" or \\"unite,\\" is the beautiful unity of breath and body, of breath and movement. Can you breathe? If you can, then you can do yoga. And David Swenson makes that perfectly clear in his book.<br /><br />Swenson starts the book by defining the eight limbs of yoga: (and in this case I will give English terms for understanding) ethical disciplines (yama), self-observation (niyama), posture (asana), breath control (pranayama), sense withdrawal (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and state of joy and peace (samadhi). The practice of Ashtanaga noursihes the eight-limbs.<br /><br />\\"Through regulation of practice, the eight limbs are nourished. Personal insights begin to manifest. We become aware of what we put in our bodies and how we interact with the world around us.\\" This is just a small part of the text.<br /><br />Next, Swenson teaches Ujjayi breathing (oceanic or warrior breathing), the foundation of Ashtanga physical practice, in a simple and straightforward manner. Without the proper breathing method, you aren't doing yoga. According to Swenson, if one practices the advanced series without the proper breathing, then one is just doing gymnastics, i.e. yoga isn't about twisting yourself into a pretzel. It is about intention, mindfulness, and movement combined with breath.<br /><br />He teaches about the Bhandas, the locks of the body--defining and teaching technique so that you can practice with intention and technical correctness. He explains vinyasa, which is linking one asana to the next via the marriage of breath and movement, and one of the unique aspects of Ashtanga practice.<br /><br />The page by page illustrations of the practice also include ways to adjust asanas as a beginner or even a novice while you are working to go to go deeper and deeper into each pose. There is nothing in the practice that Swenson leaves out. These illustrations are so practical and accessible that I doubt you will ever be stuck or confused. His text is clear and precise, and not without a touch of wit and wisdom, without any pious or rigid superiority.<br /><br />I do own David Swenson's DVD, which was made in the early days of yoga videos and, although an adjunct to the book, is not his finest teaching tool. He wears the microphone, and the sound gets buried every time he bends or dips his head, and the one-camera action is limiting to a three-dimensional practice. This is one case where I would definitely recommend the book as the superlative teaching tool over a DVD demonstration.<br /><br />The spiral-bound pages are user-friendly and the thick, high-quality paper is solid and substantial. At the end of the book, he also includes the complete and photographed series in non-segmented and visual reference so that the reader can see the practice as a \\"colorful tapestry in motion\\" and \\"mandala of movement.\\" He links Surya Namaskara A & B, the Standing Sequence, Primary, and Finishing Sequence.<br /><br />As a bonus, he includes short forms for the busy practitioner (or if you are short on time) and the Intermediate Series in photos. A purist may balk at the abbreviated series, but Swenson is as pragmatic as he is mindful. David Swenson communicates Ashtanga Yoga beautifully, in a way that brings the layman to the practice, and he understands that sometimes East meets West in innovative ways. However, he is no short-cut artist; it is obvious that Swenson practices the full regimen six days/week. If your aim is to purify your practice, his book will give you essential guidelines and tools.<br /><br />Namasteon is limiting to a three-dimensional practice.

B0028KGD8I|5.0|This is probably the only place I have seen a bad review for Dexter on. This is  great Show and everyone I know absolutely loves it. The first episode of season one take a while to pick up, but after it's smooth sailing through the rest of the seasons. It's a psychological thriller, and at times it can be a little gruesome but it is the best show I have seen in a while.
B004S699K4|1.0|Attention Amazon.com customers....    1. Avoid this release like the plague. This Blu-ray Disc only has the movie and nothing else. LITERALLY! No subtitles, no trailer, no anything.    2. The picture is subpar for a high-definition transfer. Not to mention, it's not in the original aspect ratio. H20 was filmed in 2.35.1. This version's ratio was changed to 1.78.1.    3. The audio is pathetic. You don't even get surround sound. You get a pitiful DTS 2.0 Stereo track. The DVD at least offered us a 5.1 mix. I thought Blu-ray Disc was supposed to be an upgrade from DVD?    Save your money and avoid this title. Echo Bridge has a reputation for butchering films and they did themselves justice with this one. Until we as consumers stand up and quit buying this garbage of a release, they will never give us the quality that we deserve. The links below will give you a little more information concerning this release.    [...]  [...]

B001DHXT1G|1.0|There should be a law that if you intend to relaunch a franchise less than five years after the last attempt, every negative must be destroyed if it winds up being worse. From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a complete story. Knocking out the whole origin chapter during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce never came off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk. He actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brain, which kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that's supposed to fuel the story. They're both mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors. This blew up in Marvel's face.
B004DCB62M|1.0|I don't understand reviews that state this has a wonderful indexing system for the kindle.  It only takes you from the main table of contents to the beginning of each collection.  You must then page to each individual story.  Technology is much better than this when implemented.  It is not implemented well for this collection.  I bought this based on the good reviews of the indexing.  I would gladly pay several dollars more for a well indexed collection.
0307593495|1.0|This was my first Kurt Wallander novel.  Apparently, it's Mankell's last.  Last year, when I read Stieg Larsson's Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, I remember a lot of reviewers remarking that Larsson was a very skilled writer, but that Mankell is Sweden's master of crime fiction.  Huge fan of Larsson that I am, I was REALLY looking forward to reading Mankell.  Having just finished TTM, the other day, I have to ask: seriously!?  Everything about TTM is lame, including the 'mystery' and its resolution (which relies on quite a lot of ludiculously unlikely coincidences), the writing (highly repetitive, cliche) and the characters (one-dimensional).  TTM reads like a very tired novel from the pen of a writer desperate to put his series to rest, yet who had only the flimsiest idea how to do it (witness the 2 second wrap-up at the end of the novel, a thumb-in-your-eye to all long-time Kurt Wallander fans, I'm sure).  I'm really hoping that said fans share my disappointment with this lackluster effort (it's not looking good so far; my fellow Amazon reviewers are almost universally gushing in praise).  If they do, then I'll go out on a limb and give an earlier HM novel a try.  If TTM garners only the same sorts of praise that earlier HM novels did, however, then I'm tossing in the towel.  On the basis of TTM only, I have no idea why HM has enjoyed the praise and success he has.  If you want to read TTM, pick up a copy from the library or the remainder shelf, for sure.  Full price would be a very poor investment.
1567184855|5.0|All the pertinent books I have read so far treat the short intervals when people were declare4d \\"dead\\" and later on came back to life. In all those cases the soul had not departed the body, hence the impressions, or experiences that those people have had are in no way comparable to the experiences people have had AFTER THEIR SOUL DEPARTED THEIR BODIES (the \\"permanent\\" dead)as described in this book. From a mystical point of view, the  cases listed in this book are \\"genuine\\". Best book I've seen or read on this subject. Highly recommended.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|There is no good reason the original theatrical releases of each film aren't being included in this set.  Just like Lord of the Rings on Blu-ray, I won't be purchasing this set until a complete version is released.  I'm not going to reward Lucasfilm with my money for a sub-par product.  I'm patient, but I'm upset the impatient, frivolous masses are delaying my enjoyment.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Wes Anderson creates another film, that did poorly at the box office, but was a fantastic film. The film comes off weird, but a couple minutes in, you'll be loving the whole vibe. The oddness of the characters, the animation, and the music all gives it a tone that you think would be off putting but is one of the most refreshing takes on a movie in a while.    Mr. Fox (Clooney) promises his lovely wife (Streep)that he will stop stealing, in light of getting caught red handed. George Clooney, Meryl Streep and small parts from Anderson usual's, Murray and Wilson make up the extraordinary cast. The characters are unique and develop throughout the film. Mr. Fox is a animal trying to find freedom from his boring, monotonous day, and Badger is a hot-headed lawyer. The writing is top notch, and never gets boring, and the music is perfect for the movie. There is constantly ambiance noises (they recorded voices outside in a forest) like birds and crickets. But best of all is the animation. The whole film is brought to life by this. I can not express how great this was, and previews don't do it justice.    The film has a deeper meaning (every one has an animal in them) and you will not leave the movie unaffected.

B004H4XDBI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked being in Adam's head. Do not misunderstand - this is not about Mia's recovery from the acccident of the first book. This is all about Adam.

I read it twice in a weekend!

Seriously, one of the best, most gripping 2-hour movies I ever saw. One man told me the movie was so powerful he had nightmares about it.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|The blu-ray transfer of Battlestar Galactica is well worth the extra money from the standard-def version of this series, in my opinion.    If you haven't checked this series out, you won't be disappointed.  Some of the best science fiction television that has come along in years.  Adult themes and violence; wouldn't recommend for the under 10 year old crowd.    The story weaves a great character drama and draws as many female as male fans so your spouse may actually enjoy it with you.    Highly recommended.
031261246X|5.0|Others have already pointed out everything I could say about how great this book is so I won't go into too much detail about storyline. I will say that I almost never read novels these days, especially anything to do with computers or networking since they're so inaccurate. I like Dan Brown but Digital Fortress was painful to read.    I normally go to bed at 10 or 11 at the latest, this novel had me up until 2am the first day I bought it, and 1:30am the second night. I had to keep slowing myself down while reading it to make sure I took the time to enjoy it, instead of just racing to the end to see what happened. A real page turner and very scary. I'm now 471% more security conscious than I was. I wish I could tell you how I reached that exact number but Mark has made me too paranoid. :-)
0765326353|4.0|I adore Sanderson as an author. I've read everything he's written aside from the WoT books and loved all of it. He does a great job of giving his characters complexity and depth. Even his \\"simple\\" characters have multiple layers and feel much more lifelike than most other authors in the genre. And he kept that going in this book.    On the other hand, the book hardly seems about the characters. It tends to focus more strongly on morality and ethics. Which would be fine, but we're not talking about \\"advanced ethical dilemmas that challenge who you are as a person.\\" We're talking about, \\"don't oppress people.\\" And, \\"treat people how you'd like to be treated.\\" Further, because Sanderson tends to stray from sex and violence, as a rule, you wind up with a book you would expect to find in the Young Adult section. Certainly an extremely well executed YA book, but a YA book nonetheless.    Further, the philosophy and ethics on display are remarkably heavy-handed. Two of the characters (Jasnah and Sallah) have dialogues where they \\"discuss\\" ethics, merely as a means of conveying these ethics to the reader. Some parts read like a PSA for troubled teenagers.    Overall, it's a good book and I will definitely read the next one in the series. I just hope that it isn't so preachy about things that most of us learned by the time we were 10.
B001FB5634|2.0|If you plan on buying or renting this you may want to skip my review as I may spoil some of it for you.  The film was well made the cast was outstanding.  The scenes were unbelievable but that is where it ends.  I watched the whole DVD and was left wanting something more.  I did not read the book and probably will not and it may have lost something in the book to movie translation.  If you like happy endings this is not your movie.  That may be why I didn't like it and do no recommend it.  I wanted a happier ending. I wanted and end!  I know full well that not every story has a happy ending.  But even in movies as depressing as \\"Schindler's List\\" you got to see the good as well as the bad.  Also it doesn't really end which I hate and you never know what caused all of that.  That frustrates someone like me just like at the end of \\"Ronin\\" I wanted to know what was in that damn case.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|In this day of earbuds and other \\"cheap\\" options for personal stereo listening these Sony headphone really step up and deliver on sound quality. Nice bass and treble resonance. I use them for game playing and movie watching. Lightweight and study. Definitely worth the investment for people who listen to music in a home theater setting. They might even be ideal for travel although they don't offer Noise Cancelling.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I watched the show religiously on AMC and pre-ordered this Blu-Ray set as soon as the last episode had a commercial for it.  This is easily one of my favorite shows on any network, and it's gloriously gory in HD.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the show, you owe it to yourself to watch, especially in HD.  The sense of loneliness and stillness is constant.  There are tons of zombies, but they are probably the smallest part of this show.  Instead, it's how these survivors react to the zombies that will keep you coming back.  Another great thing about this show is that there is very little musical score to it.  This makes the show very quiet and still.  You can hear every footstep and every breathe which gets your heart racing because you don't know how close the next horde is or if they will be able to hear those footsteps.<br /><br />After reading the comic books (which are excellent), it's safe to say that these are a departure.  There are some similarities and most of the time I knew approximately what was going to happen, but it also threw some screw balls at me which kept it from being boring.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about buying this, just do it.  You'll be glad you did.
B004A8ZWTW|2.0|Having greatly enjoyed previous Jane Eyre versions, especially the '06 film with Ruth Wilson, I was really looking forward to seeing this as soon as it came out. What a disappointment. It is WAY too dark and depressing, not just in the scenes/situations that require that tone, but almost throughout the entire film. Ms. Wasikowska basically spends the entire picture walking around looking sad. It is VERY slow moving and there's very little character development in general. And to top it all off, the ending is very anti-climactic. There was an audible sigh in the theater at the end, as in -- that's it??? Judi Dench was a bright spot and there was some nice scenery from time to time. But that's about it as far as the positives. Both my daughter and I left the theater feeling like we'd just been to a funeral. Clearly this is one classic that did NOT need another production.
0061478784|4.0|I very much liked this book.  It was fun and imaginative.  I highly recommend it to adults and young people looking for a light little adventure.  I also highly recommend the movie.  It's a bit different in parts, but also wonderful.  I do wish this would have been available on Kindle.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|This case is very versatile in the sense it can be used to transport and protect many different types of electronic devices such as a Garmin Nuvi GPS, small digital cameras (e.g., Nikon Coolpix), cell phones and mp3 players such as an Apple iPod.  The quality is good and the pull string used to open/close the case works very well.  It has a nice belt clip and did an excellent job of protecting my Nikon camera during a two-day visit at Universal Studios Resorts in Orlando.  This case is at such an excellent price point that I've purchased several, which I've given to family and friends as gifts.
1416596585|5.0|Google has both transformed the Internet and become a verb synonymous with 'search.' \\"In the Plex\\" is the product of author Steven Levy's having spent five years attending internal Google meetings and meeting with hundreds of employees. The book's content covers Google from its origination up through its latest management reshuffling attempt to reduce bureaucracy and speed decision-making. Readers will be impressed by the strategic muddling (eg. Google's beginning without any sense of a business plan; Overture's failure to patent its AdWord predecessor - allowing Google free access to the concepts), mistakes (eg. initially trying to sell the company for $1.6 million to Yahoo, DEC/AltaVista, and Excite so the founders could return to Stanford; going against China's government; attempting to build an on-line searchable database of books - rejected on legal grounds; keeping the details of its data center secret), and masterful moves (eg. the thinking underlying Android,  Adwords, and PageRank; the conduct of its IPO), its emphasis on recruiting extremely qualified staff (often PhDs in new computer-science fields) and ability to use them well (eg. allowing 20% of work time to be spent on self-selected projects), the firm's ability to both significantly lower costs while increasing speed, and its emphasis on data-driven decision-making - despite projects often initiated by a whim from either of its brainiac founders.<br /><br />The term 'Google' came from a misspelling of the term 'googol,' meaning 1 followed by 100 zeroes. Early 1998 search queries sometimes took ten seconds, while dealing with only 50 million sites. Results returned were often obviously erroneous (eg. confusing 'bio'  in a context denoting 'biological' instead of 'biography'), combinations of words (eg. 'New York' vs. 'New York' + 'Times,' or + 'New York' + 'Times Square,' and 'rock' vs. 'rock' + 'little'), and spam. Today's searches return much more accurate results in hundredths of a second and reference billions of sites. Improvements came from automatically including references to synonyms, incorporating the user's geographical location, changing the programming language and algorithms, hardware revisions (eg. increased use of solid-state instead of disc memory), and increased hardware.<br /><br />Google now has an estimated 24 data centers around the world - each holding at least $1 billion worth of low-cost 'home-made' PCs managed mostly by redundancy-providing software (instead of the typical more expensive and reliable servers), located in areas to minimize power costs (eg. near the Columbia River/Bonneville Power, colder climates that reduce/eliminate the need for A/C), using its redundancy capabilities to run the centers hotter (less energy costs), and using Google-owned fiberglass 'pipes' bought at a steep discount after the dot-com crash. Overall, Levy contends that Google data center costs are only one-third that of others when built.<br /><br />The importance of speed to success was confirmed when Google tripled the speed of its web-based photo services, and saw a 40% usage increase the day of implementation - despite no public notification of the improvement. The value of free services that help Google advertisers was demonstrated when Google bought Urchin in 2005, revised it into 'Google Analytics' so marketers could track site visitors from all sources (including links within PDF documents) to determine which ads were working best, according to eg. frequency viewed, sales, time spent on site. Google AdWords revenue increased about $3 billion after Google Analytics' implementation because buyers felt more confident about their expenditures. Similarly, it has gone on to provide 'Conversion Optimizer,' another free tool that provides automatic bid management for AdWords customers by analyzing data from both the target and similar advertisers, geographic origin information, etc.<br /><br />Google search results are frequently improved through studying instances where users quickly decided to return to the search page, and when the item they selected to examine was far from the #1 result returned. Over 600 algorithm changes were implemented in 2009. Changes are often tested in an 'A/B' manner in which about 1% of users access the changed algorithm, and their reactions compared to remainder using the old algorithm. Google has also compared search engine use, with and without ads, and found that users prefer results that include relevant ads - separate from the search results.<br /><br />Early on Google's founders saw language translation as a way to expand knowledge, and then hired a German with a recent PhD in the area of computer translation. Following IBM's lead, he fed large amounts of identical text in different languages into algorithms designed to learn language nuances and how words/sentences correspond from one language to another to ultimately produce translations. It now offers translation between over 50 languages - eg. allowing businesses to advertise across countries, researchers to draw from a much larger base of information, and Google Android phone users to better communicate in foreign lands. (Android was also originally an acquired entity.)<br /><br />Google has also shown it is not afraid to borrow from others - either via buying other companies (eg. Urchin), adopting from others (eg. AdWords grew out of competitor Overture's approach), or learning from others' mistakes (eg. users disliked GoTo's mixing paid ads within organic search results - Google's AdWords instead put them on the right side of the page, or at the very top).<br /><br />Providing free 411 directory assistance service to phone users allowed Google to build an effective voice analyzer that now serves up text messages from voicemail; en route it also collected revenue for providing relevant ads to users.<br /><br />Internet users frequently become concerned over privacy issues - Facebook being the most infamous in this regard. Google also has had problems - concerns over its street view (pictures from the street), facial recognition application, Google Earth (acquired - originally Earth Viewer), retention of individual user search information, and inserting relevant ads into gmail. Resolution of these concerns is an on-going activity/problem.<br /><br />Early after its founding, venture capitalist John Doerr convinced founders Page and Brin to hire a business-savvy CEO by exposing them to Steve Jobs, Andy Grove, Jeff Bezos, etc. While Jobs was their first choice (unavailable), Doerr convinced them to instead hire Eric Schmidt. Schmidt had a PhD in computer science from Berkeley, was co-author of a well-liked coding tool (lex), had been Chief Technology Officer at Sun Microsystems, and CEO of Novell. This month Schmidt become Google's executive chairman (focus on partnerships, customers, government outreach), and was replaced as CEO by co-founder Larry Page. Pundits contend that the unsaid reason for the change is that Apple's recent revenue and earnings growth has been about 2.5 times faster than Google's (eg. Google passed on the opportunity to develop Twitter - it now reportedly is in competition with Facebook to buy it). Facebook is also seen as pressuring Google - especially in improved data center power efficiency (using higher voltage to reduce transformer energy losses from about 23% to 7%, and server designs that allow use of cheaper 'swamp coolers' instead of A/C - despite the higher humidity. Facebook also has released its new data center design details, allowing anyone else to use them, creating increased scale economies for all - thereby reducing Google's current cost advantage and leaving it with huge sunk costs. Finally, Levy adds that Facebook has accumulated information on hundreds of millions of users - their likes, and specific characteristics. As of now, Google cannot access such information. (Google's current '+1 initiative,' analogous to Facebook's 'Like,' is an attempt to counter this important missed opportunity - registered +1 users are given the opportunity to easily recommend specific Web links that come up in search, even websites accessed without Google's help.)<br /><br />Every new Google hire must be approved by co-founder Larry Page. The entire process averages about 60 days. Technical applicants' references and academic records are checked, and up to 8 interviews with tough technical or engineering questions are required. Prior to final approval the applicant's file is also reviewed by a hiring council, deciding whether to forward the applicant to Page, or not.<br /><br />In the early days of the iPhone (2008), Google noticed that owners of these phones were doing a huge number of Web searches - despite Web pages being slow to load on phones. Google began working on ways to search by talking or taking photos (eg. take photos of movie posters to pull up trailers; can also eg. translate photos of foreign menus), and now has a 97% market share for mobile searches.<br /><br />Example of a simple, but important strategic move: Google Toolbar places a Google search box atop a user's browser as a corporate defense against Microsoft putting its own search engine (Bing) into its Explorer browser. The incentive for users to do so - the browser also provides a pop-up blocker. Another example, conceptually simple, but no operationally, is Google's envisioning that the future of search will be on mobile devices - hence Google's foray into smartphones via Android. (Mobile ads, however, sell for less than half the price of Web ads.)<br /><br />Google's Android strategy has been somewhat self-defeating and is somewhat of an enigma. Android is an operating system designed for cell phones, developed by a firm that Google bought 7/2005. Some envision Google's purpose for Android, given away free in typical Google fashion (typically the carrier pays about 20% of a phone's cost for the operating system), is to undermine Apple's dominance of the smart-phone application market through also providing users with valuable free applications (eg. free directions to drivers, free international calls and texting, quickly locating requested types of businesses, etc., gmail) Supposedly this would provide a competitive advantage and turn the phone revenue market towards advertising, and Apple's disadvantage. (The jury's still out.) Early on Google also tried directly selling unlocked phones using Android, hoping carriers would give those buyers a discount on service. (They didn't, and probably resent the direct and potential losses in revenue.)<br /><br />At this time (5/1/11) there are about 170 devices that run Android OS, vs. 5 for Apple's OS. Android gives carriers 30% of app sales (less credit car fees), vs. Apple keeping this amount (developer gets 70%). Apple vets applications before they are allowed, and Google does not; has sold about $3 billion worth, vs. $100 million for Android.<br /><br />Author Levy contends that Google's social media efforts have been a comedy of errors. It lost the bid for Facebook's advertising contract to Microsoft, and instead had to settle for contracting with MySpace. It blew an opportunity to start a Friendster-type site in 2002, called Orkut.com that quickly dominated Brazil and India - by the time Google revamped operations to speed U.S. performance to acceptable performance, Facebook was on the rise. It also passed up buying Twitter early in that company's history.<br /><br />Finally, no examination of Google would be complete without reflecting on its sometimes seemingly haphazard strategic moves. These include buying Picasa (stores user photos free online), Google Earth (free 3D closeups), and efforts to make energy more cheaply available to consumers and itself. Activities in the latter area include $250 million-plus investments in home appliance management in collaboration with G.E., a 'field of mirrors solar plant, wind farms, government lobbying, etc. It is difficult to see how this contributes to its main line of business.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Google is clearly an incredible company, despite missteps. As a result, its market value is close to that of Microsoft. \\"In the Plex\\" allows readers to understand why Google is so impressive, why it is fundamentally an advertising company (almost 98% of 2009 revenues came from advertising - 70% from its own websites), why its business model relies on giving away services (search, Gmail, maps, etc.) - it builds volume, and why it now is threatened by Facebook. Levy's book, however, requires additional information from other authors, Wikipedia, Google on-line sources, and current news articles to obtain full value.

B001EBIRZE|1.0|I had to abort watching this movie; my kids are in tears and even the adults feel a bit sick. First you must suffer through an extended sequence of watching an obnoxious abusive family mistreat the heroine. Then \\"enjoy\\" her take nasty revenge. [warning plot spoiler follows] We turned it off when we got to the \\"school\\" in which a sadistic principal is shown to throw a second grade child out an upperstory window and put another in an iron maiden torture device. This movie is obscene. No possible ending can redeem the first half hour.
0679882820|5.0|My daughter loves loves this book - it's become her favorite to take in the car.  She's not quite old enough to read it herself,  however she makes all the animal sounds.  It's compact and travel friendly!
B004P96WJ0|5.0|Since I already had all the dvd versions of these first seven symphonies, I debated at length whether to spring for the bluray upgrades.After all, the dvd video, when upconverted, can approach HD quality, and regular dts is almost as good as DTS MASTER AUDIO. Or so I thought! Plus these are exemplary performances.    First off, this set is a remarkable bargain. I was able to get this for $66 plus shippping, less than $10 per symphony! So just on that basis, get this and sell your dvd versions, if like me you bought those previously. With the huge storage capability of bluray, more effort should be made to put more content on the bluray releases as in this set, given the huge price premium normally being demanded. The Theilemann Beethoven is another example of offering much more material on the bluray set.    The video on this really is very good, later performances showing greater improvement than the earlier ones, at least to my eye. The DTS MASTER AUDIO is much better than the original dts, more detail being evident with better dynamic range., and they appear to have fiddled with the balance in some areas, to beneficial effect.I usually had to reduce the center channel output relative to the left/right channels in the dvd versions to get proper perspective. Not so with these. The earlier problems noted by early acquirers of the individual bluray releases seem to have been fixed.    The only problem I found was I was unable to the get time elasped/time remaining status feature to work on these discs. These are the only discs in my collection (dvd or Bluray) that won't respond to this. Since I like to cue in on certain passages, this is annoying. Unless I somehow have pirated discs, I don't understand this!    Anyway, These are definitely worth having, and are a true steal!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|For a quick touch-up to a blade, this is handy, small and effective. Haven't tried the diamond-coated rod on serrated blades.
B004132HZS|5.0|If you're reading this it is probably too late already, but the Amazon.com review above contains two fairly big spoilers!!  I won't repeat them here in case it isn't too late, so if you haven't already, be warned:  DO NOT READ the Amazon.com review!!  If you've read the Sherlock Holmes original stories you might be able to figure out at least the first episode's villian anyway, but the two spoilers above are about how this new re-imagining is structured, and you will love watching these first three episodes even more if you maintain the surprise.  One spoiler is for the first episode, but the other totally spoils part of the ending of the 3rd episode!    That said, these are awesome.  I watched them on Masterpiece Mystery on PBS yesterday.  The dialog, quips between Watson and Holmes, and one-liners are smart and hilarious, the characters are great, it's awesome to see Martin Freeman in such a different rold (that he plays PERFECTLY), and Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect as Holmes.  The modern-day updates with Watson as an Afghanistan vet, text messages, smartphones, and other technology are the perfect translation of how Sherlock Holmes would be if he had been written over a century later.  Loved everything about this show, and I am dying to know when the next three episodes will be available in the US after airing in Britain in Fall 2011!

0756404738|5.0|Read this book series!! Amazing that I now consider Patrick Rothfuss one of the best fantasy authors currently writing even though he only has two fantasy books under his belt. With the ability to weave a detailed tapestry of life, legend and lore so rich that it feels like someone recounting true events.  Complex characters with rich subplots.  I honestly don't know another author or book series to compare this to.  George RR Martin? Tolkien? Sanderson?  Wingrove?  Tales of the Arabian Nights?  I'm at a loss.<br /><br />In book two of the Kingkiller Chronicle trilogy we have young Kvothe entering a new year at the academy. This book takes our hero from a boyhood to manhood.  Along the way he'll deal with challenges from old enemies, meet new enemies and allies and journey to the ends of the world. The action never stops and all the threads of humor and drama from the first book continue.<br /><br />Is this a perfect book?  At times the story is rather... Baroque...self-indulgent...and filled with pubescent wanderings.  Is it on purpose?  The main character is admittedly self-aggrandizing.  The world of the Fae is supposed to be strange. Teenagers are certainly driven by hormone more than intellect.  I'm rather on the fence with any criticism.  I just can't tell how many of these \\"flaws\\" were intentional because they work.  Read it, you know you want to.
0670022411|5.0|Since getting a Kindle, I find myself reading cheap, fun books about witches and vampires.  They are great, in their way, but certainly not literature, and certainly nothing to remember for more than a weekend.      This book, which I actually read in its weighty, hardcover version, was different. It was worth reading, even if the content had not been fun,which it is.  It is well-written and well-edited. I enjoyed the writing as much as the story.     Highly recommend it and can't wait for the sequel.  Beth O'Keefe
1401207529|5.0|This was the first comic i have read in around 10 years, it was amazing, the story brought to life new aspects of Batman that i had not thought about. Once i was finished i had to find follow up stories, this one comic has got me hooked again.
B004GNFSO0|5.0|The book kept me glued to the pages for hours on end. I can't remember how many times I stopped to highlights points of intensity throughout. I've never read a piece of nonfiction in which men not only endured, but pushed themselves through their own hell.    It wasn't until about halfway through reading that I head about the veracity of the book being put into question. The story seems almost unbelievable enough to categorize as fiction, but that might only be because it is so incredible.    If you're looking for something epic and gripping this is the right book!    Now to see how the film compares...
0446530573|5.0|I am a huge Sopranos fan. I miss the show. I just ordered this cookbook and love it. It has wonderful authentic Italian recipes. It has little bits from all of the Soprano characters. If you love Italian and the Sopranos, get it!

B001DTUTU8|4.0|My daughter loves it. Although when it first came out I fell in love with the movie! Couldnt ask for a better flick!
B004RLPTT0|3.0|Soundtrack is better than the movie. Not sure that's entirely a good thing from the movie makers perspective. The first half of the album I really enjoyed. It's a little on the harder side which I like. The second half get's pretty mellow and i'll end up deleting them. You need to buy the whole album to get \\"army of me\\" hence why I have the whole album. If that song was available separately I'd suggest getting just the first five songs and save a few bucks.
B000ZN802W|2.0|Director Penn takes the banal story of a pampered narcissist who goes into the Alaskan wilderness to find TRUTH only to die alone from starvation and tries to turn it into some kind of Homeric epic of self-discovery. Penn tries to tie the hero's angst to his parents who in the book aren't disparaged in any way. Sure, they have problems, but the boy's 5 siblings seem to be just fine.  Only he turns on them and sets out to deliberately bring them pain they don't deserve.     The book is ok for high school kids. It's well-written by an author who himself went through a period of alienation as a young man. The difference is he lived to tell the tale.     Ironically, the parents the hero so despises go on to establish a Foundation in his memory. They're doing just fine. Also, the hero took on his journey a sleeping bag his mother had made by hand, slept in it every night and in the end it becomes his shroud.  What would Freud say about THAT?
B004G5VFOU|5.0|This my kind of traffic. I can listen to Traffic while I am stuck in traffic. I love the Deluxe Editions.
B0040QYROK|4.0|I saw a heavily edited version of this movie back in 1978 as part of a science fiction film festival in Massachusetts.  Taking it for what it was, I was fairly impressed with the silent-era effects.    33 years later, I'm more able to appreciate just how grounbreaking this movie was.  With all the original \\"dialogue\\" (title cards) restored to the script the filmmaker intended, the story moves much better than previously.  It also helps that virtually all the missing footage (nearly an hour compared to the copy I saw) has been not just replaced but restored.     There's been a LOT of work done for this release and I'm only too happy to have supported the effort by buying this release.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Outstanding action packed movie blended with a comedy! Many people already reviewed it, so I see it pointless to write things, which already been told. Just confirming how awesome the movie is. Scenes like: when Bruce meeting with the Russian man, ex-CIA agents in-love, are totally epic! One kind of a movie. You definitely have to get that movie and watch.
B004289ZW0|3.0|This unit worked very well when it worked.  The touch sensor does not work well for turning the unit on and especially off.  We have tried everything to get it to work better, but there is no consistency in the switch.  The unit will shut off if it gets too hot.  It is black and most pilots would place it on the glare shield.  We found that it overheated in about 15 mintues in cool weather.  The manufacturer recommends wrapping it in white paper.  We found the glare shield can still cause it to overheat.  A well ventillated area would work best.  When the unit works, it is a great tool.  The iPad can be most anyplace in the cabin and work.  We use it in a Citation, and the unit worked when the iPad was passed to the back seats.

Still, 'Bitter Fingers', 'Better off dead' and 'Someone saved my life tonight' are excellent psych/art-rock melodies, with gorgeous vocal harmonies, and the gut-wrenchingly gorgeous ballad 'We all fall in love sometimes' is even better.

B003NFM3JU|2.0|I read most of the critical hand-clappings of this movie which made me purchased and watched it.<br />My overall extreme limit conclusions of this fim to others are that the makers of this suggestive<br />allegorial dance of death in this macabre film are as if they were on a binge of Cocaine, Heroin,<br />Cannabis and/or were drunk when they created such non-realistic monstrosity as this is not for<br />general viewings but ONLY for sick morbid voyeurs. Those involved into the indiscriminate killing<br />(mascaring) of the great \\"Charles Dickens' Novel\\" who the man himself would had came out of his grave if<br />he did saw that film.  At least they had some commonsense into hiding some sequences by not letting them have the real 3D Effects thus making them less gruesome.  No wonder the world is going to the dogs (so to speak) whilst the film industries, the media tabloids  and law-makers are glorifying all the lunatics on illicite drugs, booze; and criminals who are infact just law-breakers (that many of those so-called actors & actresses who were caught on drugs, booze etc and still are being glorified , we the filmgoers had lost count).Apart from this film's illogical mentalities and ill-conceived film-making perceptions; some sequences<br />had great & fantastics 3D Effects which would be a delight for 3D moviegoers.<br />I without doubt do give this movie a \\"2 out of 5 Star\\" rating after taking in considerations of this great<br />great work of Charles Dickens Novel and the few Real 3D Effects.<br />For ALL Filmmakers To Peruse & Digest >> Signed BY One of Many of Their Box-office payees.

1401309666|5.0|The Long Tail was a very interesting read and as a media and music entrepreneur in a niche market, Afro-Soul Music in French and English, his theories made a lot of sense and I was able to directly relate to them since they are applicable to my daily business reality. In the summer of 2009, I co-founded 413 Management, which is a hybrid record label and management agency. Me and my business partners had absolutely no experience as record executives and did not have access to a significant amount of capital, but what we did have was a supremely talented artist, Rafiya, and a vision to fill the void for transcultural music in this increasingly multicultural world. Rafiya is of Congolese origin (Democratic Republic of Congo), was born in Los Angeles, and was raised across West Africa and the Caribbean. She is fluent in French, English and Spanish, and incorporates these languages and more in her music. Apart from the lyrical content, her sound is a mixture of blues, jazz and soul with African rhythms. This belief in her ability to build and grow a fan-base was indirectly based on the long tail theory, as we were aware that her music caters to a particular niche. The following chapters, \\"The New Producers\\", \\"The New Markets\\" and \\"The New Tastemakers\\" are the most important ones from the book as they are the heart of the long tail's genesis. The chapter on the New Producers struck a chord as it discussed the democratization of production tools and how it led to a shift from \\"passive consumers to active producers\\". This rise in the amount of producers, led to an increase in content best suited for niches and to a lengthening of the tail. These tools empowered consumers, and new markets such as iTunes, provided them with business avenues. Because the production became democratized, the age of recommendation came to be; an age where peer reviews are sought after and have as high or higher value than reviews from the establishment and mass media. These three chapters illustrate how 413 Management is able to navigate the industry. We are new producers with talent and access to tools, we leverage new markets such as iTunes and Amazon where Rafiya's \\"Amazing\\" debut album is available for retail, and our marketing efforts are focused on encouraging people to sample, share and recommend. Her fan-base is growing organically as a result of word-of-mouth and her continued success and growth in the past two years illustrate the long tail theory in practice. I wholeheartedly recommend The Long Tail because it is easy and fun to read and provides valuable and practical business insights.
B004G6009K|5.0|Tanlged is the 50th animated feature that Disney has done and it is perfect.     It's a great movie for anyone, regardless of gender or age. There aren't a lot of songs in this movie, but the ones that are in there are catchy. I especially liked the song \\"I See the Light\\". The characters are very likable and the dialog is great. Mandy Moore Donna Murphy and Zach Levi did an excellent job with the voice acting. Although Tangled is in full 3D, it felt like I was watching a mixture of Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|First of all, this movie got snubbed at the Oscars for some reason. But that wouldn't be the first time the Academy Awards didn't understand what they were watching or hearing. This movie should have won for best score, and best visual effects, and best sound editing, and probably at least nominated for best costume designs. Instead it was only nominated for just one (sound editing). And I read critics complaining about the plot, or storyline. That's because their little brains couldn't understand it. Nor did they have the patience to try and figure it out. They prefer a more imaginable movie like Avatar, which has a more simple plot and storyline.     And have you noticed if the actors are good looking, according to the critics they can't act. That is because most of these critics are ugly nerds. Well their is some good acting by some good looking actors in Tron's Legacy, and I'm not just talking about Jeff Bridges. I mean nothing Oscar worthy, but good enough, especially for sci fi. Actually this cast did a better job than the prequels to the original Star Wars (A New Hope). Anyway, forgive me for ranting and raving, but other people already wrote a review of the story for you, so I'm just telling you another side to this movie. If your wondering if this movie is worth buying, go rent it and see for yourself. I would compare this movie to Matrix as the closest thing, but of course they are very different movies. But if you really like Matrix, you will probably like this one.

1608870081|4.0|This book was well worth the price to any potter fan. There is almost a \\" Where's Waldo\\" feel to the book as you flip through intricate pop ups and try to find the places marked in the Legend on each page.  I will admit that the book seems a little too intricate for little hands as there are small parts that need some fine tuning to get the full pop out but over all this is a well done book.  There are little extras such as wanted posters and a howler that defiantly add to the book.
B00461MY30|3.0|Why oh why can't the Stones have a Derek Taylor or a Neil Aspinall? I was so excited to see this reissue of the original mono Lps on heavyweight vinyl, I could barely sleep at night until I bought it, but when I finally got it, I realized that I didn't need it. Not to disparage the fine music here! The Stones roared out of the gate in 1963 with \\"Come On\\" and never stopped being great right through the 1984 B-Side \\"Think I'm Going Mad,\\" and anybody that tells you otherwise is just being a stinker. And I will say that I appreciate that some effort went into the project, and it's wonderful that vinyl is still being pressed, but who oversaw this release? It's as sloppy as those cheap trade magazines that the Postman tucks in with your mail. A little care could have made this so much more. Sure, it sounds fine, but were the original master tapes used, or some other source? What am I listening to here? I have 1st or early pressings of everything in the box, and I have to say that the originals sound better in every instance, and the well-known cold-stop of \\"Tell Me\\" on the 1st album has been faded out here, so it can't be cut straight from the the master tape. Why not give us a little paragraph somewhere explaining the remastering process?     The Beatles haven't thrown meatless bones like these to their fans since the first CD pressings back in the '80s. Even the Monkees know that we like liner notes, extra photos, and whatever session information you can give us. Who is in charge here? The slimmest of booklets added to the box could have gone a long way toward redeeming this release. And the sleeves for these albums, several of which are bona fide classics of the form, have all been hastily re-created from scratch. Where is the love? Half of them are made by scanning the original sleeve and blurring out the moiré pattern, photoshopping out the text and then re-creating it with a similar font. Honestly, they look like crap. On some sleeves, like \\"Out of Our Heads\\" and \\"Through the Past Darkly\\" they went to the trouble of using the original negatives, but didn't bother to duplicate the original darkroom processing, so instead of a groovy blown out image of the Stones pressing their faces against the glass on the \\"Big Hits\\" cover, we get a crystal clear image of five grown men making silly faces. Not quite the same thing. And worst of all, for the enlarged sleeve of \\"5 by 5,\\" the designer decided to expand the blank space around the boys, requiring a bit of Photoshop to replace Keith and Brians's shoes that were cropped on the original EP, easy enough, but wait! Brian's new Beatle boot is tiny and mis-shapen and Keith has two right feet! Who checked this for quality? I can't help but feel that the same level of slop and carelessness went into the production of the music as well. Isn't there someone, somewhere who can step in and start curating the Stones' legacy? Bill Wyman perhaps?     And please don't tell us that we'll have to wait for a posthumous re-appraisal of the Stones catalog, come on boys, we know you got the dirty end of the stick when you signed your contracts back in the '60s and you probably don't like giving money to the Kleins, but you've had no trouble getting hot dinners and more for a long time now, how about opening the vaults? We all know what's in there and we'd sure like to hear it in nice pristine sound, fresh off the master tapes.    Bottom line, even if you have the money to burn, and you don't already have these Lps and Eps on vinyl, don't buy this box, you can find them all on Ebay for less. I did.

0061438294|3.0|I had high expectations for this book because I read many of the overwhelmingly positive reviews before purchasing. Yes, this book is a fairly good read, but is not a great resource for reading body language. There are a lot of 5 star reviews posted from law enforcement mentioning how essential this book is to reading body language. Honestly, I am 20 years old and have no experience in law enforcement and I still found this book to be full of basic information. I think the most important message this book sends out is to pay attention when people are talking- not only to what they're telling you, but also what their body is telling you. If you pay attention, you'll notice when someone is comfortable or uncomfortable in response to certain questions or stimuli.<br /><br />Since I found that a lot of the points made in the book are easy to pick up on and understand, I will point out some of the points I highlighted as interesting. If you have a decent amount of life experience, I think you'll find that you know as much as I do or more on the topic already.<br />- \\"When there is stress, the lips will begin to tighten and disappear\\" (Lip Compression)<br />- \\"We purse out lips or pucker when we are in disagreement with something or someone, or we are thinking of a possible alternative\\"<br />- Concealment of hands (under tables, behind objects) should be avoided because this can be perceived as uncomfortable, withdrawn, sneaky, or deceptive.<br />- Finger pointing is an offensive gesture.<br />- Steepling of hands is a sign of confidence.<br />- Thumbs sticking up, or sticking out of pockets is a display of confidence.<br />- Stroking of fingers or palms is a sign of nervousness/ low confidence.<br />- The feet are the most \\"honest\\" part of the body. How they react is most genuine, however, is often overlooked.<br /><br />There are more interesting facts mentioned in the book that make it an interesting read, but I mentioned these because they are the ones I think are most interesting (that I didn't know of previously). Navarro also adds stories of his personal experiences in numbered boxes within the text to emphasize how these techniques have helped him in the FBI and throughout his personal life. The issue I have with these numbered boxes as well as the pictures within the text is that they are referenced throughout the text, but they are not organized well in the book. I feel like the pictures should have been added directly below the paragraph mentioning a certain behavior, rather than on the next page or 2 pages over. I bought this thinking it would have more information on micro-expressions, because of my fascination with the show \\"Lie to Me\\" based on Ekman's studies, but it didn't incorporate a lot on the topic.<br /><br />Overall, it is an interesting book, but not quite as informative as I would have liked.

037571457X|5.0|This is a story of me, my fellow countryman, and so many other Iranians who witnessed revolution, war, oppression and finally had to leave behind everything we cherished to immigrate to another country. I love how simple yet sensational this book has written. If you are one of the people, who want to know more about Iran and learn it from a perspective of a child/adolescent this will be an excellent read. This is also a great read for the children of Iranian immigrants who can not relate to their parents pain or past experiences. This book will make you laugh more than cry, and if were present in Iran at that time, the story will take you back to those times and may make you sad.     I highly recommend this book, if you want to educate yourself about Iran and Iranian culture in a more fun way.

B001DF68MA|1.0|I ordered this product after reading all the great reviews. However, when the weeride bike seat arrived we attempted to place my 10 month old 19 pound daughter in the seat and her butt did not even fit. My daughter could not even get into the seat. My daughter is not overweight (LOL) so this bike seat is designed for a baby that is really small in size and weight. This is one of those kinds of products that you have to buy at the store so you can try it out first before you purchase it. The baby they show in the picture on Amazon looks twice as big and old as my daughter and somehow the boy fits just fine (How does that happen). Do not buy this product online go to the store and try to fit your baby in the seat first and you will see what I am talking about. Futhermore, I don't even see this product on sale at any of the local stores. Save time and the hassle of having to return this product. My wife and I were getting ready to install the bike seat so that we could take our baby on a bike ride and was extemely dissapointed that she didn't fit into the seat. Please do your research first because I was so sold on this product when I viewed online and read the reviews. Remember some products that you buy online don't always appear the same when they arrive and this is one of those products. However, we have been using Amazon.com for several years and have always been satisfied. This is just our first bad experience. I hope this helps people.

0316017922|5.0|Outliers is an insightful, elightnening and deeply motivating book. In a nutshell, the book's theme is this: Conventional wisdom has it that success is the outcome of a person's individual merit; the product of their innate talent, dedication and hard work. Gladwelll argues that this theory is too simplistic. He provides evidence that the oppertunities a person meets over the course of his life, the upbrining he is subjected to, the amount of effort he invests and the cultural traditions passed down to him are the key determining factors to his success.    The book is organized in two parts. The first part, titled Oppertunity, argues for the idea that successful people couldn't have achieved much if it weren't for the oppertunities that came their way. Several cases are put forward to support this hypothesis. I will take the liberty of citing two instances to clarify the point: (1) Bill Gates was among a handful few who had access to computers in the late sixties worldwide. This allowed him the very special chance of mastering computer programming while still a teen-ager. An opportunity harldy offered to anyone else. (2) Many of the giants of silicon valley, the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Erich Schmidt, were born on just the right time (1954-1955) to allow them to make the most of the personal computer boom. Had they been a little older or a little younger they would have missed it.     The second part, titled legacy, argues for the idea that the values and traditions of a certain culture make its people either more or less qualified to succeed at certain tasks. For instance persistence and hard-work are hallmarks of the chinese culture assimilated by countless decades of tedious rice cultivation. It is instructive to note that cultivating rice requires ten to twenty times the effort needed to cultivate the same area with wheat. Owing to their culture, chinese students are more persistent and hard-working hence better than western children at such subjectsas mathematics eventhough their IQ is equivalent or, more often than not, slightly less than their western counterparts.    On the down side, two issues are in order: (1) Many would agree that the author makes very bold claims on the basis of relatively little evidence. Indeed most of the book's assertions do make sense but they are soley based on no more than a handful of cases. (2) When I reached the end of the book I couldn't help feeling \\"Hey, is that it?!\\". The amount of hype around the book raises one's expectations to such a high point that I believe most readers will end up slightly disappointed.    All said, this is one of the very best nonfiction books out there.
0817439390|5.0|I love this book.  Bryan Peterson's book is easy to read.  The book encourages you to use your camera at the end of each section.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I initially had little interest in \\"Sucker Punch.\\"  I had seen the preview but it was not compelling.  Yet the negative reviews were so many and so hateful, and the positive reviews were so few but equally passionate, I became curious, if worried.  I actually sat where I could make a quick getaway as soon as I could no longer take it.  This was a movie I was prepared to dislike.  Instead, I fell in love with it.      It all began with Ken Kelsey and his unhappiness over how the movie \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" turned out.  I greatly admired Kesey's the book and was excited about the prospect of a movie.  Unfortunately, the producers took the easy way out.  Instead of doing it from the POV of Chief Broom and his mental issues (paranoid schizophrenia, likely), including the hallucinatory and occasional unpleasant imagery, the decision was made to tell the story objectively, using Randall Patrick Mcmurphy as the central figure.  Telling it from the POV of Chief Broom must of smacked of trip movies and the like and nobody wanted to do that.  It sounded far too risky a box-office proposition.      I was left hoping that there were people here and there in Hollywood who wanted to do the story like the author intended.  That is, tell the story of a tragic rescuer from the POV of Chief Broom himself.        I have no idea whether any of these thoughts of achieving the vision of Kesey's novel ever coursed through the mind of writer/director Zack Snyder when he was writing \\"Sucker Punch.\\"  From what I have read he mostly wanted to assemble something along the lines of a framing device that would enhance and give ironic detachment, or some such thing, to this  tale (tragic in its own right) of female empowerment.  The Battle Angels/Pretty Warriors so standard in Anime would have been a tempting symbolic choice.  Much of the story requires fantasy, this being a tale set in a mental institution.  The main character \\"Baby Doll\\" would of course use the wildest fantasies shecould summon to sustain her.      It's all in the mind, after all, the \\"threater\\" of consciousness (or of war or of movies -- \\"theater\\" works in all three contexts).  Nevertheless, Snyder's choice of setting and show wouldn't work for most (surely test audiences would have reported their dissatisfaction).  In fact, as near as I can determine, about 1/6 of the potential audience hated even the idea of the movie.  But whatever his reasoning, once the decision was made he did not hold back.  [Not that he is the kind of guy to hold back in any event, as viewers of \\"300\\" and \\"The Watchmen\\" well know.]  It was a daring move.  The relentless imagery of male monsters dominating a prison/nightclub/brothel of helpless females could easily have succumbed to parody.  What fascinated me, as I watched the film, is how able Snyder was to keep it all under control and only tearing loose during the fantasy sequences.      But do the fantasies work?  They are the visual core of the movie and Baby Doll is not a paranoid schizophrenic.  Her fantasies would be nothing like those of Chief Broom.  The issue is not if the fantasy sequences should have been cut or  reduced in scope for enhance audience acceptance.  The issue is: do they work given the character of Baby Doll and her situation?    They do.  They are plausible.  Anyone caught unjustly in such a situation (young male or young female) would have violent fantasies of fighting back.  If not against the immediate obviously enemy, impossible in this instance, than any enemy that suits the psychological purposes of the terrified.  The more oppressive the external situation, the more extreme the internal response would be.  Having gone to the lengths to portray the girl's environment as horrible as he did, he must have felt equally compelled to show how under the leadership of Baby Doll that the girls would fight back against imaginary monsters every bit as intensely as real ones.  And from that ongoing fight draw strength to keep fighting.    Though female empowerment, violent or otherwise, is a fairly common theme in hollywood, Snyder cranks up the volume to a pitch that is almost unbearable (I mean that literally -- as an experiment I saw the film in one of the \\"I-Max\\" theaters and almost had to keep my fingers in my ears throughout).  But he succeeds thereby in keeping the girl-power theme and characters from becoming cliche.    The chosen psychological symbolism won me over completely, I went with it without regret.  In addition to the Anime stylization, beautifully done, the figure of the \\"Wise Man\\" is crucial.  He is the Jungian animus for Baby Doll (who is the Jungian anima for another of the captive girls, Sweet Pea).  The \\"Wise Man\\" (wonderfully played by Scott Glenn) centers the fantasy sequences.  His appearance at the end of the film also enables the perfect emotional release.      \\"Sucker Punch\\" is a masterpiece and as such a demanding one.  While I understand most people who go to the movies expect to see \\"really wide-screen TV.\\" This requires more attention.  So I   reserve by impatience for those critics who seemed unable to watch the film without being in a rush get back to the office to see that they say the same thing as their fellow critics (I lost track of how many times \\"teen-age boys and masturbation\\" were used as the ultimate put-down.  How droll.)  If that's your profession, it is not good enough.  Critics have a responsibility to go beyond what Ebert calls \\"level-1\\" criticisms when it is clear the writer-director is putting all that he has into it.      A lot more could be written about \\"Sucker Punch\\" and will be written.  For now, to the entire cast, pitch perfect, and this wonderful, sad tale that fully realizes at last Kesey's vision of freedom, psychological and existential -- magnificently done.
B00001X591|5.0|This is a really good double CD of some of Albinoni's best music, very well performed by the invariably excellent Academy of Ancient Music under the Christopher Hogwood.<br /><br />This is rather underrated music, I think. It's certainly much more than the pleasant baroque wallpaper which many people think Albinoni to be. The adagio of Op.9 No.2, for example, is one of the loveliest movements I know in a baroque concerto. These are very fine performances, too, which bring out the verve, joy and sheer beauty of these concertos. Andrew Manze is always brilliant, but the oboists are also excellent. Frank de Bruine in particular has a lovely, flowing, effortless sound and I find that I prefer this set to my old CM90/Standage set with Anthony Robson, who by comparison seems a little plodding in his articulation and phrasing.<br /><br />It isn't surprising that Andrew Manze and Christopher Hogwood, two real giants of Baroque performance, should bring something special to these concerti and the playing of Frank de Bruine is a real bonus. It's a lovely set and very warmly recommended
0307593495|3.0|I have been a follower of the adventures of Kurt Wallander since the beginning of the series and have read the novels several times.  I found this concluding novel, The Troubled Man, well . . . troubling.    Since I am 62 years old and in good health, I find it shocking that Wallander is falling apart at the age of 60! I can sympathize with the many irritations of aging and the loneliness as friends die or fall away, but Wallander is made to seem decrepit in this novel.  Today's 60 is yesteryear's 45.      I was also disappointed with the lack of any conclusive ending. What has been learned?  Has Wallander come away with any important new knowledge about the world? What was the point of the exercise?    I will be going to a lecture by Mankell tonight. I will be asking him some of these questions.      I found the ending depressing.

0307595862|4.0|Jo Nesbo hasn't gotten as much publicity as, say, Henning Mankell, but his Inspector Harry Hole series, set in Norway, is terrific for fans of Scandinavian noir mystery.  Like so many detectives before him, Inspector Hole has a dark side the size of the Black Sea and struggles with his self-destructiveness and alcoholism.  But you can't help but like him and root for him.  In this installment -- the 7th in the series but the fourth to be translated and released in the USA (why oh why can't they release them in order?) -- Hole is faced with a serial killer who seems to be taunting him specifically.  Bizarre snowmen are left along with murder victims and Harry's team -- joined by sexy new detective Katrine Bratt, tries to find the common link before a new victim is killed.<br /><br />The plot is twisty, twisted and moves rapidly, and Harry continues to fight his demons while trying to keep it together enough to identify and capture The Snowman.  Suspenseful, atomospheric, and a must-read for fans of Nesbo, Scandinavian thrillers, and of course for fans of Harry Hole.
0618918248|5.0|Honestly, I wish everyone would read this book, whether or not they are atheists.    Being a young atheist with a lot of religious friends, I found comfort in this book. It definitely helps lay out arguments that I have had trouble expressing in the past, and it points out many foolish aspects of religion. One of Dawkins' main goals for this book is that atheists will know they are not alone and that atheism is not something to be ashamed of.    This book has generated a large amount of controversy because religious people think that Dawkins is being crass, mean, and obnoxious. I kept waiting for those parts to happen, but they never did. People simply don't like when other people disagree with them.    I strongly recommend this book to religious people too - those who are unsure (or not), and are willing to listen to the other side's argument before passing judgment. You might be surprised when you read this book.     Lastly, don't knock the book until you've read it.

B004EC5IV6|5.0|This movie is Amazing 10 out of 10. If you liked the original you'll love this and those of you new to the Eva or Anime scene will be hooked.  Restarting the Eva series not an easy task.  2.22 is took 1.11 to the next level. Sure some changes where made and a new character was added but it doesn't mean the original wasn't great or that it's creator meant it should be this way from the start/original, it`s a new rendition of a classic. I'll be honest some minor parts/scenes aren't as powerful as the original but others take it to a hole new level of awesome.  It's like building a house the way you wanted it.  It's perfect but then 10 years later he thinks: I kind of wish I did this part a bit differently or I wonder how it would work if this was rearranged a bit. I only hope 3.33 and 4.44 is just as epic if not better. Can't seem to wait the year or so for the next release.
0446563048|4.0|This book had plenty of great ideas that I feel would be good for companies to implement.  However, it would not be realistic for ALL companies to implement for various reasons.    I also like the pace of the book.  The author took us through vulnerable periods with his company, but because he did, it helped lead to a better understanding of where he is coming from.    Highly recommend it to anybody that is looking to starting a business.
B001974DG0|5.0|I slid a bit to the left in my bucket-seat, brushing the sleeping guy next to me. We were turning right. Looking up from my Kindle, I realized the bus was nearing my stop and that I wasn't going to finish. Already in a bit of a daze from such an abrupt transition back to reality, I staggered slightly as the sun hit me when I stepped out onto the sidewalk. I looked around for some place to sit down, any place that would offer a bit of refuge from the scorching sun so that I wouldn't have to do my grocery shopping wondering what the last ten pages of this suspenseful novel held in store for me--or more accurately, for the characters I had grown to love. Settling near a handicap ramp on the opposite side of the street, and extremely thankful for the wind blowing in from the sea, I picked up where I left off and ... well, pretty soon, I began to cry.<br /><br />I'm not a particularly emotional person: I tend to *think* my way through life and its problems rather than  feel; however, I don't suppress emotions when they come, and I certainly don't have many qualms about crying. It is rare though.<br /><br />As the tears kept coming while I re-read the last two pages for a second time, sitting there on the side of the road with taxis and buses and people passing me by, I was glad for my sunglasses. Not because I particularly cared what people walking by might think, but because I wanted no distractions, wanted nothing to pull me me back to reality prematurely--or ever.<br /><br />In the afterword of this book (or on his website), Koontz explains the special place Watchers has in his life:<br /><br />\\"If I am fortunate enough to live to such an advanced age that my wardrobe consists entirely of bathrobes, loose jumpsuits, bunny slippers, and adult diapers, and if I am also fortunate enough to be writing novels in that twilight of my life, I know that I can expect to receive mail from readers that says, in essence, 'I love your new book, but that story you wrote when you were just a puppy, Watchers, is still the best thing you've ever done.' I'll be at a book signing-accompanied by a nurse and by an attendant holding an ear trumpet, hooked to an IV drip feeding me liquefied nachos, wearing a lavishly embroidered jumpsuit more dazzling than anything Elvis ever wore in his Las Vegas period-and as readers greet me and receive their inscribed copies of my latest effort, a significant percentage of them will ask me to write a sequel to Watchers. I will smile, promise to think about it, try not to drool, and explain that I don't believe in writing a sequel to a book unless I can be sure it will be at least the equal of the original.<br />...<br />\\"Eventually, I wrote a few books I liked as well as Watchers; but to date, as I compose this essay, I can't honestly say I've written one that I like better.\\"<br /><br />He also writes about the themes of the book--insight which I think would be helpful for a prospective buyer:<br /><br />\\"In an annotated bibliography in The Dean Koontz Companion, a book about my work, the bibliographer made the following observation about Watchers. 'It embodies all of the major themes with which [Koontz] has been obsessed: the healing power of love and friendship; the struggle to overcome the past and change what we are; the moral superiority of the individual over the workings of the state and large institutions; the wonder of both the natural world and the potential of the human mind; the relationship of mankind to God; transcendence; and how we sustain hope in the face of our awareness that all things die.' Those are, indeed, the fundamental issues in this novel.<br />..<br />\\"We have within us the ability to change for the better and to find dignity as individuals rather than as drones in one mass movement or another. We have the ability to love, the need to be loved, and the willingness to put our own lives on the line to protect those we love, and it is in these aspects of ourselves that we can glimpse the face of God; and through the exercise of these qualities, we come closest to a Godlike state.<br /><br />\\"With that said, my greatest hope is not that you find the themes of this novel worth analyzing, but that you find this to be a rip-roaring, rattling-good story. I hope it keeps you so far out on the edge of your chair that you have butt bruises from repeatedly falling to the floor. I hope it makes you laugh and cry. A novel can have multiple, intricately woven levels of theme and symbol, but it fails if it is not first a wonderful tale.\\"<br /><br />If you are someone who needs to know a full plot summary before you're willing to spend $10, there are plenty of reviews here that give away quite a bit. However, I suggest that you will enjoy it more the less you know. In any case, whether the above \\"major themes\\" catch your interest or not, whether you already know the basic outline or not: if you have a heart, you will probably thoroughly enjoy this, and perhaps you'll fall in love--like I did--with this beautiful story of a dog and those he loved.closest to a Godlike state.    \\"With that said, my greatest hope is not that you find the themes of this novel worth analyzing, but that you find this to be a rip-roaring, rattling-good story.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|I ordered the Eclipse video from Amazon and since it was previewed I wondered if it would be in good shape and worth the money....it was! It had 2 discs, which is great because I love to check out extra info on filming. The best part is that the movie was great! I have read all the books and thought there was no way that they could get such accuracy in the filming as the story progressed...but, they did. It followed the story line and was, in my opinion, the best one yet!! Buy it...enjoy it!
0312370849|4.0|The book seamlessly intertwines historical facts and fiction in a way that both entertains and pulls at your heart.  The characters, though fiction, are relatable in a way that makes them real.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that typically enjoys non-fiction books or books that are based within actual historical events.  It was an extremely quick read.
030746363X|4.0|Guys. Get over it.    It's been months since 'WHOA! WTF? MILLIONS OF REVIEWS BEFORE LAUNCH?!\\"    Read the other reviews. Those posted about a month after the launch. If you do a search, you'd find lots of blogs and forums where people are getting dantastic results out of this.    I'm one of them.    Don't expect too much deep information. Tim does take time to explain but it's not a study, neither is it a book focused on an idea, a regime or a diet.    It's a handy guide book to helping you get what you want, from losing weight, to putting on muscle, to helping you gal get the big O even.    And here's to all those of you who are going \\"No way! I've been doing xxxxxxx for xxxx years and it's always xxxx, what's recommended in the book is too short.. and it will never work blah blah blah'    Again, get over it. Just because you're used to a method doesn't mean other methods work. And again, if you do a search, you'd find blogs and forums where people who've been, like you, doing a certain thing for hundreds of years and they realise that recommendations in the book makes sense.    You know why? That's because they had an *open mind* and *tried* it. Everyone had their reservations, but they went out to give it a try.    So, 1 tip for reading reviews: if you see someone knocking a product just because they think it doesn't work...read it first, acknowledge and understand it, keep it in mind but move on and look for someone who has actually tried it and proved that it failed/succeeded.    Enjoy.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I discovered Wolfram Alpha's website thanks to a friend. And it, and this app, are just mindbogglingly powerful. I tried typing in some weird calc problems just to throw it off, and it handled them perfectly. It's handled everything I can throw at it. Hard to believe how cheap this app is. The symbol keyboard is a godsend for entering math problems on a phone. This could easily replace my TI-89.
0240815807|5.0|I am not yet completely through this book,but would like to offer that the author has created a very good reference book for mixing.    One thing that has \\"hit home\\" for me is Mike's refreshing reminder of room acoustics and monitoring options.  The online chapter reference tone sweep has my home studio going through some bass trap changes this month. (Each chapter in the book references a website that helps the listener understand concepts). This online/addedum trend is welcome in my opinion (another good example is Roey Izhaki's \\"Mixing Audio\\" -it comes with dvds with reference audio).    This book is a reminder that mixing is an art, a craft, and it is a technical process. Time spent mixing improves the process...      How many times have you found yourself online trying to find a book that informs you how to mix and have your songs sound like Arcade Fire, Black Eyed Peas or whoever?    There is no book like that (we would all own it and our mixes would sound great...) But, with time, proper approach,and this book (again added to others in your library) mixing will get better.  I know my mixes have improved (even after 20+ years. I also know that this book refines my developing approach. Thanks to Mike Senior. A \\"must\\" buy.

It ought to be a disaster. For reasons I can't fathom, it isn't. It is absurd, gratuitous, vulgar, childish, stupid and utterly incongruous. And I thought it was great.<br /><br />Natalie Portman playing against Danny McBride: what kind of fevered imagination comes up with that sort of an idea? What sort of miracle worker makes it actually happen? What sort of genius makes it work?<br /><br />And that's just the start: There are jarring conflicts everywhere you look. Animal husbandry: You may cross a horse with a donkey and get a mule, but some hybrids just don't go: You don't play a [[ASIN:B0041KKYEM Black Swan]] against [[ASIN:B001IBIDLI Kenny Powers]]. You don't cross [[ASIN:B000TJBNHG The Princess Bride]] with [[ASIN:B0000A02TZ Animal House]]. If you do, you sure as hell don't throw in [[ASIN:B00004Z1GI Bad Taste]] for good measure. You don't blow millions on Industrial Light & Magic style digital effects one moment and then fill the screen with a cheap rubber alien wizard (a dope-smoking, kiddie-fiddling alien wizard at that) that looks like it came from a joke shop the next. You can't rely on non-expectant swearing and expect to get away with it. At least, not fifty times. But all in all, it seems to work.<br /><br />Danny McBride - last seen heading [[ASIN:B001IBIDLI Eastbound and Down]], more or less reprises Kenny Powers, complete with mullet and goatee (no method actor, Mr McBride, I dare say), only here he is a useless younger prince in a mediaeval kingdom in a land far, far, far away. On a different planet, indeed: there is a twin moon, and it is important to the plot (I suppose you could call it a plot).<br /><br />Unlike most mediaeval kingdoms this is one where everyone intones smutty innuendos with English accents that come and go like rotating speakers. Kenny - I mean, Thadeous - is more or less [[ASIN:B00005A1ST The Black Adder]] to Fabious' Prince Harry. Fabious (James Franco, swashing his buckles for all he is worth and for some reason channelling Steve Tyler from Aerosmith) has a whale of a time as a slightly dopey hunk. They are pitted against evil warlock Leezar (a superb Justin Theroux) a criminally under-explained villain who has bad teeth, worse hair, and who also has a whale of a time, vacillating between occult power and sexual impotence (there are knob jokes aplenty here). Theroux' delivery of his actually pretty ordinary material is spot on.<br /><br />Along the way there are entirely gratuitous scenes of every dimension: sand-encrusted nude barbarian vixens in the thrall of a large fat pink sorcerer (John Fricker) in a nappy, in a Thunderdome. Much violence, and more gay innuendo. Did I mention there are lots of willie jokes? There are the occasional outrageous visual gags. There's a frisky minotaur. There is a scheduled coming together of the moons which will result in a rare event called ... - well, you'll just have to see it, because I don't want to spoil it. Totally immature, but still I just about wet myself.<br /><br />Natalie Portman boxes on far more gamely than anyone has any right to expect a recently minted Oscar laureate to. I constantly found myself wondering what on earth had possessed her to sign up for this project - perhaps relaxation therapy after a long dose of Darren Aronofsky - but being eternally grateful that she had. She is a tremendous sport throughout, and my regard for her is undoubtedly enhanced.<br /><br />I have complained in these pages about the reliance on rote, formula and technology in place of proper drama in modern motion pictures. No complaints on that score here: while there's absolutely no proper drama on speak of, you couldn't fault David Gordon Green and his team for showing a bit of spirit. Instead of a tightly followed plan, there's no plan at all (Do you think my methods are unsound? I don't see any method at all, sir).<br /><br />But when the alternative that passes for comedy these days is [[ASIN:B00177Y9ZW Meet The Spartans]] and [[ASIN:B000EXDS4S Red Riding Hood]] (At least, I can only assume that's intended to be a comedy) then this has to come well recommended.<br /><br />Leave your maiden aunt, your kids and your critical faculties at home, come for a laugh and you'll have a blast.<br /><br />Olly BuxtonBut when the alternative that passes for comedy these days is [[ASIN:B00177Y9ZW Meet The Spartans]] and [[ASIN:B000EXDS4S Red Riding Hood]] (At least, I can only assume that's intended to be a comedy) then this has to come well recommended.

B004BLJQOK|2.0|I rented this after reading a review of it that said it was as good, and in some ways better, than the original film. It's not in the same league at all, for the following reasons. The soundtrack is heavy handed and corny. The heavily saturated look of the film is unoriginal and has been done much better elsewhere (the first Red Riding film, anything by David Fincher). The creepy androgyny of the vampire in the Swedish version has been lost--she really seems like a different species of creature in the original. The bullies are also much more menacing in the first movie. At the end of that film, you really believe that they're these weird hick psychos willing to kill the little boy; here they seem more annoying than frightening. They give the main character a wedgie at the beginning of the US film; the boy screams and whines, and actually wets himself. I thought he overreacted: it was only a wedgie, after all. In the original, one gets the sense that they boy's life is unbelievably bleak, and made even more miserable by the sadistic attentions of these three bullies. It makes sense, therefore, that he would bond with the vampire girl from next door. The ugly 80s socialist environment of the original heightens one's sense of the boy's predicament. Here, the 80s environment seems like a mere schtick (fun 80s soundtrack, anyone? Yawn.). Finally, I'd heard that this movie made some key changes to the original film. Not so--many of the key scenes are almost identical. The original is ultimately a beautiful, bleak, deeply weird love story; this one's a slightly boring rehash.
B004I4H8Q8|5.0|I must say that I was a little bit worried about this re-issue Vinyl LP. Sometimes UMG manages to succeed sometimes not. The sound of the LP is just superb. I have the original 1970 Vinyl LP, thus easy to compare them. I would say that it sounds so close to original and better than any CD I have heard, despite of small mixing changes. Men at Metropolis Studios in London UK have done a great job. I do not now if it is all analog mastering or not, but sounds warm like analog. Pressing is very good, but not excellent. Plain paper inner sleeves I changed at once to better soft audiophile sleeves.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Bought the hbo mini series \\"The Pacific\\" as a Christmas gift. It was not opened until march due to the fact we was out of state for the winter. When it was opened and started watching it, the last 2 dvds are scratched, and skipping. I need to try to exchange the set now and it is past the return date. Real pain as if I don't have a millions things to do.
B0000AUHPK|1.0|I was expecting more of this film, I found it too dragging and at times I got up from infront of the TV to do something else.  I regret to have bought it.
1439102724|1.0|As a long-time high school English teacher, literature lover, and Jodi Picoult fan, I felt that I  must say something about this Picoult disappointment.  I've read almost all of Picoult's books and have loved most of them.  They provide great springboards for discussion among my friends and family who are also Picoult fans.  We've spent many hours discussing the merits of Picoult's writing style and subject matter and have delved into topics of great controversy, thinking about things in ways we've never thought before.  We've talked about issues that we would never have discussed without Picoult's urging us to by writing about such controversial topics.  As a high school teacher, I was particularly touched by Nineteen Minutes, a novel through which Picoult made me see in a different light the issues surrounding a school shooting.    But I'm afraid Picoult has let me down this time. In her previous novels, Picoult's characters hold varied political, social, and theological ideas and ideals, but I have never been sure which way Picoult herself leans.  That is definitely not the case in Sing You Home.  This time, Picoult's political agenda shows way too much!!  Her characters usually possess great depth and dimension, but this time, they are all \\"flat,\\" and one-dimensional, defined by their position on gay rights.  The Christians, in particular, are so flatly drawn that they are just \\"stock\\" characters.  The one exception to the flatness occurs in Liddy, but in this case, Liddy engages in a behavior at one point in the novel that defies the very one-sidedness of her.  It's totally unbelievable that Liddy would do this.  The novel reads as if Picoult did the research (which she usually does incredibly well) on the political and social leanings of the gay couple and the characters in their camp, but absolutely no research on what true Christians are really like and instead relied on negative stereotypes.  I'm amazed sometimes that when people are faced with others who do not hold their same viewpoints and beliefs and values that they label the others as closed-minded, and, yet, the people who share their viewpoints are open-minded.  They scream about intolerance and are some of the most intolerant people in the world.  Zoe falls in that category.  She is probably the most intolerant character in the whole novel.  Her vehemence toward Liddy and ALL Christians is intolerance personoified.    One final note about the book that has nothing to do with Picoult's political agenda is this:  Lucy.  First of all, as intelligent readers, we figured out who Lucy is, who her parents are, early in the novel, and yet Picoult treated the subject as if we were supposed to be surprised when she revealed it.  Secondly, the Lucy storyline was left as a major loose end.  Picoult usually ties things up better than that.    Although this novel was a huge disappointment, I shall look foward to her next one.  I enjoy an author who makes me think and gives me fodder for discussion with friends.  I just hope she won't disappoint me again.

0670022411|3.0|This book was a gift from a friend.<br />I'm not a fan of cute-and-mysterious-vampire-boyfriends books, so I wouldn't have chosen it; but I was enticed by all the good reviews I read about it.<br />It's very well written and described, a very good read, but I found a couple of things disturbing.<br />First, I don't like books where bad people is very, very bad, and good people is very good...even if they're vampires. In this book, they don't like to do harm, if they kill they don't do it on purpose and they are filled with remorse afterwards. And again: the nice-and-sexy vampire, when in danger, returns to mummy (in the sense of the other vampire that \\"made\\" him) bringing his new fianc&eacute;e with him: but, beware! Mummy's wicked and dangerous! ..he says.<br />Infact (spoiler!) she shows to the girl how she can kill a rabbit plus some other animal to feed. Wow!! I've known mother-in-laws much worse than this lady...and this is just a silly example.<br />But MOST OF ALL, this book ends with a serious cliffhanger - I'd say it DOESN'T end, right in the middle of the story, as if the author was late and decided to cut it short and do a sequel as soon as possible.<br />If you, like me, have been waiting ages for George Martin, have discovered (at the end of her last book) that your beloved Diana Gabaldon played a similar trick..well, you'll maybe decide to wait for the second part before starting with this book.
B0013D8LKO|4.0|Eyes Wide Shut is a long and somewhat sluggish film in parts but overall, this erotic drama is definitely worth a viewing or two. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are electric as a married couple with some \\"relationship problems\\". First off, this film has a lot of sex and nudity but what saves this film is the amazing musical score during that infamous \\"you know what\\" scene. This was Stanley Kubrick's last film before he died, there are some beautiful and breathtaking moments like the flashing Christmas lights on the streets of New York City. Sydney Pollack's performance was very aggravating, it takes him like 15 minutes to complete a full sentence! I enjoyed this slow burn of a film, I definitely had my eyes wide open than closed for sure!
B004D2GMR6|5.0|I had always wished that I had seen Bon Jovi back in the days of long hair and leather pants; not anymore! My husband and I popped this DVD in and for the next 2 1/2 hours we were on our feet, dancing, applauding and urging the band to play on. We were so impressed that we have played it numerous times and friends of our children have left our home as fans of the band. By the time you get to 'Livin' on a Prayer' you are pumped! Jon keeps the audience on their feet through out the concert and Richie dazzles the crowd with his brilliant talent playing the guitar. It is nothing like listening to a recorded CD, its better; and you actually feel like you're part of the crowd! Best musical DVD that I have ever bought!

1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink's book Drive, dares to push back against the established known universe of incentives and predictors. It is an easy read stocked full of science as it relates to the human condition. I found myself nodding in agreement with nearly every turn of the page. As a business owner, talent recruiter and evaluator the information flys in the face of everything I had been taught by my supervisors of the past. This fresh look at the reality of what drives us to acheivement should be a must read if you want to go into business or stay in business.
B003ELOQD4|1.0|I saw U2 at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1992 and previously owned Rattle And Hum on blu ray, so I thought \\"why not pick up their latest tour in blu-ray quality?\\" The answer is \\"Because the video quality is ok, the audio quality is great, but U2's performance itself is TERRIBLE\\"    I nabbed this when it went on sale for $10 thinking there was no harm in spending that on it. But U2's actual performance is so bad that I know I'll never watch it again and that to me is a waste of $10. I prefer to re-watch Rattle & Hum or remember the performance I saw in '92 when the actual band cared about what they were doing. Note to Bono; singing off time and slightly off key only works when there's genuine passion behind what you're doing. It NEVER works when you're doing it for show, real music fans know the difference.     If you have Rattle And Hum or have seen U2 previously, avoid this release like the plague. The ONLY way I could see this warranting a purchase is if you were at this actual show (The Rose Bowl 360) and you want to see it again, though I cannot imagine why you would.

Reading this book brought these stories to light for me. Showing the different views of all that are impacted by such events. Jodi's way of writing is a perfect way to read such a story. This book is a definite page turner.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|I'm amazed at how much I've liked this box. After putting it off for a few years `cause I already had the other three Alive discs, I decided to give it a go. Lucky me! I loved it the moment I opened it.<br /><br />The unreleased Millennium Concert is a great surprise - it's no short of spectacular really to hear Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter sounding so good!!! The songs are played on the right tempo, nothing is rushed here. Peter's drumming very much alive and kicking with a bottom end unheard of! Ace's blistering leads as exciting as ever! Paul singing his heart out on Love Gun and 100,000 Years! Gene singing Deuce and Let Me Go, Rock `n' Roll like it was 1974 all over again! All four are in great shape; they could still make you believe they were the best band in the planet then. It does make you feel kinda sad they didn't carry on. So, to cut this short, The Millennium Concert is a true moment of celebration - no hype here.<br /><br />Then we get Alive! and Alive II on single discs for the first time. I must admit this makes listening to these classic albums a lot better! With no interruptions and all mixed as if it were continuously flowing - something which was sadly lost on vinyl - they are just hard to beat, especially Alive! which benefits a lot from it. We also get a better sounding Alive III - which is cool - but I guess it feels kinda out of place among the other three albums with the original Kiss.<br /><br />The Alive! box set is also a very well designed release and comes with a beefy booklet full of pics, excerpts of interviews, and full credits and contents of the original albums.<br /><br />All in all this is a must-have for all Kiss fans, be it for the newly improved remastering by George Marino in 2006 which really makes it all sound even fresher, be it for the surprisingly strong  Millennium Concert, or be it for the amazing package where all this larger than life music is housed in. Don't hesitate getting it.
0743454537|5.0|This book was one of the best that I have ever read. I am the younger sister in my family and have been very sick for most of my life. My sister was always there for me and took care of me. Although it is a different story then in this book, I felt very connected. The strength of book Kate and Anna in this book is phenomenal. They are both very young but fight for what they believe and want for themselves, not what their parents want. Anna keeps her sister Kate's secret that she does not want Anna to donate her kidney and instead fights with her parents to emancipate herself. Incredible strength for a 13-year-old. The end of this story broke my heart...I cried. I recommended the book to my sister and she cried, too. I would recommend this to anyone, whether you have a sister or not.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Worth the money.  I agree with the other reviews in that the end comes rather suddenly.   Definitely fun to play, though!   I'd love to find more games similar to this one.
B003Y5H542|5.0|First off I loved the movie. I went in knowing that it was a PG movie, and as an adult, I would expect no surprises knowing the rating. There seems to be a lot of fuss in the fact that the movie was violent, there was mild swearing (nothing worse then whats on tv or in the hall ways of your children's school)and that the characters are very...gritty and un-disney. This is where my issues start. While looking at the reviews here and in other boards. I truly think as seeing the reviews and the criticisms posted here that people are no longer able to make rash decisions for themselves or their children.    THE MOVIE IS RATED PG..PARENTAL GUIDANCE SUGGESTED. TAKEN FROM THE MPAA WEB SITE \\"PG -- Parental Guidance Suggested. Some Material May Not Be Suitable For Children. A PG-rated motion picture should be investigated by parents before they let their younger children attend. The PG rating indicates, in the view of the Rating Board, that parents may consider some material unsuitable for their children, and parents should make that decision. The more mature themes in some PG-rated motion pictures may call for parental guidance. There may be some profanity and some depictions of violence or brief nudity. But these elements are not deemed so intense as to require that parents be strongly cautioned beyond the suggestion of parental guidance. There is no drug use content in a PG-rated motion picture.\\"    There you have it, right there, written for everyone to be aware of. This movie had nudity to an extent as one person woefully explained in the form of the upper half of a unclothed headless Barby doll (which can be found in toy chest's around the world more then likely striped completely naked and possibly rubbing up against other toys,will someone please think of the children!!) Second is the swearing, they say hell, damn, and bitch don't like the language see above PG RATING and stay out of the theater until you can process that warning or any other \\"suggestions\\" that theyhave had to put on everything, because people whine and scream about what they are exposed to in this world. I am so sick and tired of being told what is ok for me, by the vote of everyone else just because they can not control what their family is exposed to. Do what my parents did, when I asked to see a movie if it was questionable, they said that I could see it after they watched it when it came out on tape (yes, I'm old enough to still have BETA an VHS tapes)prime example, I wanted to see Robocop (I was 10 when it came out on tape), my dad watched it and said no, I didn't see it until I was 17.   Last, there was a complaint about character style, that they were to scary to be understood by young children....again see PG rating. One person went as far as to criticizes the design of a character in the movie for being totally unrealistic. REALLY? as if the animals, while fully dressed and walking around a town, and talking set the standard for normal. People really really need to start thinking before they start typing away at the keys in the comfort of their homes, everyone is a movie critic thanks to the internet. Some just need to rethink what they are criticizing before putting it to the four digital winds an seas of the internet.  The only thing I wondered is how they got away with a PG and not a PG-13 due to the smoking and drinking seen in the movie, since nicotine and alcohol are drugs. Maybe a PG-13 would have kept the people out who don't understand parenting and telling children..no.
B00003CXPD|5.0|A gritty, heartwarming, and engaging movie, one of the best of it's decade about the struggles of Billy Elliot, to establish himself in his love of ballet against the opposition of his father and brother, and the wider struggles of the British working classes and Billy's family against the backdrop of the 1984-1985 Miners strike in County Durham<br />Billy (Jamie Bell) has recently lost his mother, and his family are struggling to survive, it is 1984 and the miners in Yorkshire are struggling against the disintegration of their way of life as a result of Margaret Thatcher's callous closure of British coal mines without providing any alternative livelihood or compensation for those dependent on the industry. Billy's father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are strongly involved in the miner's strike and the future of the family and community looks bleak. Billy's father scrapes together money to send him to boxing classes, but he doesn't enjoy them and being captivated by the girl's ballet dances he transfers to the latter, while concealing this from his family.<br />But his dance teacher, the abrasive but big hearted Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) notices Billy's talent and is determined he should be enrolled in the Royal School of Ballet in London. The resistance of Billy's father breaks down when he see's Billy's incredible talent and he will do anything to get Billy to be able to follow his passion and have a chance at a better life<br />Together with a few gems like 'This England' this is one of the few movies to focus on Britain's ever neglected and abused white working class, betrayed first by Margaret Thatcher and then by the liberal and left middle class elit, on account of Third world immigrants and Muslims, Britain's white working class have been abused and kicked around by both conservatives and the left. Scenes of poverty, such as the little blond girl with her rag doll, who stands outside the council houses, add a gritty reality to a wonderful, heartwarming, inspiring and passionate movie. Notable scenes include the clash between Mrs Wilkinson and Billy's brother tony, when Billy runs away and shakes his body in angst and rage to the tune of 'A Town like Malice'. One of the best movies of 2000 and accompanied by a really powerful soundtrack, this is a highly recommended movie to watch again and again.inspiring and passionate movie.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is an awesome author, who writes great books.  The one star ratings on here are so not fair, the people are rating the price of the book on Kindle, not the content of the book.  I just compared a book published not too long ago on Kindle versus price on Nook.  They were the same.  One person complained that not as many people would read the book, well, now Amazon has some lendable books.  I don't know how they determine which can be loaned out for 14 days to other Kindle users, but it shows up on your page where you manage your Kindle.   Don't punish the author for the price.  If you are willing to pay for a hardback book, why complain about an ebook?  It is yours forever, it never frays, never in the way, so I don't see a downside.    And all of this is just in my opinion.
1594481717|5.0|As a Psychologist for more than 25 years working with both children and adults, I completely resonate with Daniel Pink's book, \\"A Whole New Mind...\\".  I highly recommend this book!  My experience as a mental health professional has shown me the power of developing right-brain skill sets. I have seen how fundamental success and happiness in our lives of work/school and relationships/family/community requires first and foremost the development of empathy.  Further, I see that those who have exceptional achievement and leadership seem to have a higher degree of CREATIVITY (not always artistic, per se) that allows for flexibility and adaptive, out-of-the-box problem solving!  PARENTS, PAY ATTENTION!  What Daniel Pink has to say about Right-Brainers ruling the future is hopefully a wake up call: The future Pink is talking about is NOW!  Support the arts!  They are critical for the brain development of our children!  Play with your children. Actively. Creatively. Make mistakes -- they are opportunities for learning, innovation and laughter, not failures!  According to Pink, the keys to future success are in developing and cultivating six senses: design, story, symphony, empathy, play & meaning.  I so agree!  This is precisely why I teamed up with a master artist/educator friend of mine to create \\"Pass-Around Storytelling: The Shared Storytelling Game\\", a card deck of storystarters that gives a fool-proof structure for improvisational, original storytelling! (Mind you, anyone can be a Pass-Around Storyteller, no experience is necessary!) The Pass-Around Storytelling game precisely cultivates the six senses Pink describes as being critical for this \\"Conceptual Age\\" whirlwind we are in! Check out the game ([...]) and you'll see why I so strongly recommend reading \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future\\". I see it. I believe it too. Our kids (and we adults) deserve to have resources to exercise and integrate both sides of their brains!
B00127RAJY|5.0|OMG!    So I completed the 30 day shred!!!!!!!! Im sure you all know how it works by all the other reviews so im going to talk about how I felt, and what kept me going. Before I begin just know that you NEED this dvd. It is an insult not to buy it.    I ALWAYS say ok im going to lose some weight, and start eating healthy and going to the gym. It always lasts about a week tops. I never ever imagined I would be able to complete the shred. I even tried it sometime last year and gave up on my FIRST day of level 2. I could not hack it. I thought who am I kidding? Exercise is not for me!     But it is. It can be for everyone. I was just a hopeless idiot. So I tried again and decided to keep at it. The fact that it is only about 25 minutes kept me going. The fact that if I missed a day, the next day it was harder kept me going. What really spurred me on to continue doing it daily is the fact that it got easier each time I did it. I felt stronger within just a few days and this feeling was great! I felt powerful, like I could do anything. Even if results were not showing (which they were), I still FELT amazingly trim! Hand on heart, if I can do it, ANYONE can!    Jillian herself (what a beast) keeps you going also. She talks throughout the moves which makes you feel like you are doing the moves for less time. I think shes so clever too. She has clearly worked out the dvd in a way that makes it possible to keep going until the end. Plus the fact that her two buddies struggle with the moves makes you feel that you are not alone. We all have to work for the body we want.    Ive always been curvy and I do like being curvy, but I was at a point where these curves for getting rather large and I developed a bit (understatement) of a belly! I had to do something. My friends were talking about going on holiday! BIKINI BIKINI BIKINI!!!    I did the shred over 36 days. On three days I did not do it, I did some form of exercise such as tennis, walking and weights. On the other three, life just got in the way and I did not have the time. To make it simpler, I did the 30 day shred 5-7 days a week, NO less than 5. Before the 30 day shred I virtually did no exercise. Apart from walking to my car which is actually parked on my road.     When I started level 1 it was hard but doable. I did it for about 12 days. I will mention that after doing level 1 the first few days my body was KILLING me. But that does go away, you just have to power through it and the pain goes away like it was never there.     Then I moved on to Level 2.     I thought I was going to die. I wanted to kill her. I thought I would quit. This is the stage where it took the most PUSHING. The first few days of level 2 were hell. But I knew I had to keep going. I think the trick is to not be too hard on yourself. If you dont feel like following \\"bad ass\\" natalie, then don't. Modify it to suit you, but don't chicken out entirely. It does get easier and I think that if you have that in your mind it helps you see the light at the end of the tunnel. I did this for about 11 days.    Level 3 was (and still is) hard but it is challenging. First few times I did it it was quite hard but I knew I would not allow myself to quit after coming so far. At this point I was so much stronger. I thought back to before when I could not even hold a plank position LET ALONE do plank jacks etc! Amazing! At this point I could also do \\"man push-ups\\". Who would have thought!     The satisfaction you feel when reaching the cool down stretches is unbelievable. You honestly feel like you've just conquered the world, smiling and everything. Completing this shred has undoubtably been the proudest acheivement of my life (22 years old). Im even prouder of this than I am at getting my degree!    I did not go on a \\"diet\\" but I tried to eat better. For example I would try to have soups for lunch, eat more fruit & veg etc where possible and try to have breakfast in the mornings. I also tried to drink mostly water and just made smarter choices. However I still had massive boozy nights out, once a week. I still had the odd Chinese takeaway. Thats another thing that I think made it more possible. I did not deprive myself of anything. Many people say stuff like \\"whats the point in exercising if you're just going to eat that chocolate bar\\" etc. I think thats such CRAP. It is more acheivable when you do not deprive yourself. Imagine going on a hard core diet and exercise programme. It would not last (for me anyway), and I realised this is where I go wrong. I kept throwing myself in to a strict regime which was too miserable to keep up with. I still lived my regular life but with better choices.    And I lost about 1-2 inches all over; chest, arms, hips etc. I think this proves that I don't have to put myself on a diet at all. Yes, my goal might take a little longer? but for me, its the only way this goal will ever be acheived. The most visual difference I see is in the ab section. I can see muscles coming through, and my waist is two inches smaller. What I also gained from this DVD was learning that I can do anything if I put my mind to it which makes me so happy, determined and proud.    Now I will continue with the shred and start to alternate it with her other dvds, as I've read that they're good.    Good luck to you all!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|\\"Red\\" is a great movie, with people who know what \\"acting\\" means.  Keeps you laughing, builds suspense, and of course, a happy ending for the \\"lovers\\". The bad guys get what's coming to them, and true love perserveres.  REALLY glad I bought this one from Amazon.    OrgCyn
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD has all the songs from this amazing episode and a few extra musical moments from various other episodes as well.  The lyrics are included too!    For fans of the show, it's a great way to relive this episode.
0670022411|5.0|Back in the days before gothic witches and vampires dominated so much of popular literature, I was a great fan of the genre.  As the market started to flood with teen magicians and bloodsuckers in recent years, quality of writing (along with my interest) in the category began to fade.  A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES has renewed my enthusiasm.  A terrific read with well-explored characters and wonderfully-paced story.  I couldn't put it down and cannot wait for the next installment.  Highly recommended!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|It is outrageous how high the kindle edition of books are.  They are obviously cheaper to produce.  Furthermore, the kindle edition is less likely to be shared by multiple readers the way hard copy is.  I am getting to the point where my kindle sits unused as I am boycotting high priced books.  I can pack 2 paperbacks for travel as easily my kindle and charger. While some will say, these kinds of comments do not belong in a review of the book,  I think the price of the book is part of the book.  As such the price deserves to be part of the review process.  With enough protest and boycotting , the kindle books may come down to a reasonable price.  I have not checked out the price of the nook ebooks. I think I may do that.    UPDATE...   To those who complain that price should have no bearing on the review, may I say the reviews are on the \\"Kindle edition\\" of the book. The price is a significant part of the \\"Kindle edition\\". In response to those who say, why did we buy a kindle if we were not willing to pay the price, I have three comments. First, I thought it was the correct thing to do environmentally.  Secondly, as an avid reader, I purchase 40-60 books a year. I thought ebooks would save me some money. Thirdly, people do not pay the same amount for the paperback edition as the hardcover.     In closing, apologies to Mr. Connelly, one of my favorite fiction writers.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I bought these for my 12 week old and he loved to look at them. I use them as a sensory stimulation for his hands and ears. They are full of different sounds and textures.
1589946634|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of almost anything Aliens or Alien related (the James Cameron and Ridley Scott films, not the later additions).  This game certainly reminds me of that initial contact scene, when the marines are all marching in a thin formation, trying to find out where all the colonists have disappeared.    Both the board game and now card game really captures the combat and tension as the drooling monsters, literally, crawl out of the walls.  You and your buddies are struggling to get through a small set of rooms to find the end objective (so, if you simply survive, you win).  I love how the aliens swarm so quickly and the marines are slow to react as claws and fangs drag the humans down.  Both versions of this game captures the feeling very well.    Unfortunately, I also think that the mechanics of both games have limitations:  The board game was great, but since the aliens (aka. genestealers) are run by one player.  This makes the game feel more competitive and less about survival.  I might add, I own more than 1 edition of this great board game.  I feel like, without more terrain pieces and marines, you are mostly stuck with a one-on-one game.  The card game has compensated for these limitations!    The card game has improved the social feel; all the humans are just trying to survive the waves of genestealers.  However, the complexity of the game setup was confusing the first time I read through the rules.  I really needed to watch a couple of online videos to understand how to set up the location and terrain cards.  Also, the combat mechanism and speed of the swarm is quite discouraging for new players.  I sort of feel like there needs to be additional scenario cards that can be easier or harder for additional enjoyment.    To wrap all this up, you can already, order new marine cards and new scenarios, so my previous comments could be meaningless as I am still awaiting the delivery of my $5 expansions sets (and yes, I ordered 2 of them).
1401322425|5.0|You really only need one or two Jamie Oliver books in your library, but I can't help buying everything he writes.<br />This book, like a bunch of his books, is kind of light on the recipes, so if you're looking for a tome, buy something by Mark Bittman.  Jamie Oliver's gift is he presents us with templates that we are supposed to experiment with, and vary from.<br /><br />This book in particular makes me want to start digging in the soil and planting herbs and veggies right now, just so I can cook with them.  The book is a lot of fun, especially when you look at it as a starting point.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This movie was so boring and flat all the way.  the acting was really not there.  the few moment of suspence were just weird.  the good thing is that I had a special discount on Amazon and did not have to pay for it.  this was 2 hours of my time that I will never get back.  It might appeal to some of you, It just was not my cup of tea at all.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you are someone who regularly seeks out subtle, sophisticated, truthful films that avoid cliches, then you probably already know about \\"Once.\\"  If you don't, then you can't see it soon enough.    But if you have been walking out of the big-budget, mainstream movie offerings at the local 36 screen Mondoplex feeling vaguely dissatisfied, thinking to yourself, \\"there must be something more,\\" then \\"Once\\" is a great place to start finding that something more.    Pablo Picasso said, \\"Art is the lie that makes us understand the truth.\\"  Believe it or not, there is a whole universe of artistic truth that is outside the walls of the shallow, predictable realm created by market studies and focus groups.  If you are ready to put your foot into deeper waters, you can't go wrong with \\"Once.\\"    I'll let other people summarize the plot.  Let's just say that if you stick with it until they sit down at the piano together in the music store, you'll be with it until the end.
B003HKN51Q|5.0|This is the next best thing than being there. Elvis started it all, unplugged, split screen concerts, behind the sceens. Enough said.
B00447G2PM|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Even better than the IMAX \\"Under the Sea\\" 3D movie, and it is a great movie.  Brings to life undersea life.  Young and old alike should enjoy this presentation.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Tombstone in just one of those movies you can watch once a week and not get tired of it. The picture and sound got the work it deserved, and it shows. Excellent.
B000E6FSPW|5.0|My husband is a huge Rocky fan. So I bought this for him as a workout cd, and he enjoys it. An personally it does force you to push the envelope, in a good way. Awesome motivation!
B000Q66JXA|3.0|The sound, as in all the formats is excellent, the picture however is something to be desired. Patton is perfect, Excaliber, looks the same as it did on DVD. I would have never bought this if I had know the picture was of this low quality. Sorry I bought it, but I will expect an upgraded version in 6 months, and unless they want to trade me for my crapy copy, forget it.  Just my thoughts, and the price was right.

0385504225|5.0|This book was great and while it took me a few chapters to get into it (about 10), once I was that was it for me!  It does get a little slow near the end and your wondering if there is a climax or if it passed, but overall if you like Dan Brown, you'll like this and I would definitely recommend it as a read!
B0000E6XH3|4.0|First time buying from amazon and it went well got my dvd in a couple of days.  Interstella 5555 is a musical and visual thrill.  Even though it's as long as listening to a cd all the way through you get a full cinematic feel and even without many words spoken you'll never feel lost in what's going on.  Both song and video fit perfectly to tell you exactly what's going and and how the characters feel.    If you like Daft Punk or just enjoy a good work of art check this out.    [[ASIN:B0000E6XH3 Daft Punk - Interstella 5555]]
0756404738|1.0|I love NOTW.  I recommended it to friends and re-read it constantly.  I was expecting to like this book so much that I bought two copies, one for my bookshelf and the kindle edition to walk around with. I wasted my money.      The entire novel was pointless. Kvothe fights with Ambrose, travels, learns a board game, travels, learns to hunt, travels, kills some people, travels, has sex, travels, learns tai chi, travels, returns to the university.  Pointless.
0307272702|5.0|I can not begin to tell you the impact this book has had on my life.    I've cared about maintaining a healthy body image since I was 16, yet i've always struggled with it.  Before that I ate everything I could get ahold of and my parents would usually let me have whatever candy I wanted.  I'm now six feet tall and have consistently fluctuated between 180 and 210.  I understand that some of you may say that thats not exactly fat... but at the same time, I've always felt like if I stopped working out or eating small portions, I'd instantly start gaining weight again.  Also at 210, I can easily grab the large chunk of flab around my waste with both hands.  I've seen my weight fluctuate in that way time and again.  It was extremely frustrating.  I hated having to eat very little, work out consistently, and constantly feel hungry just to maintain what people would call a good body image.  I worked out at least 3 times a week (when possible).  I saw some changes from the work outs, but overall the weight always came back.  It's like I was fighting with my body, but didn't understand why.  Overall, I'm a pretty normal guy.  THIS BOOK CHANGED ALL THAT!      Thanks to this book, I work out when I feel like it and I eat however much I want with NO REPERCUSSIONS!  The only real trick is to eat as much of the right foods as I want and have less of the things that I now know are spiking my insulin and making me fat.  THAT'S IT!  My love handles are starting to melt away and for the first time I can actually make out the lines of my abs!  All of this without killing myself in the gym.  I've been doing this new way of eating with light exercise for the last two months.  Just for an experiment I tried increasing my workout regimen for a week (back to the levels I was doing before I started this new eating lifestyle, nothing extreme).  By the end of the week, I was cut and actually had a two pack!  I've worked out twice as hard when I was younger and never had this result!  REMARKABLE!  If only I could go back in time to my college years.  I'd have gotten quite a lot more looks from the ladies, instead of wishing I could look like those guys that were getting the prettiest girls.      THANK YOU GARY TAUBE for making me understand that starving myself was never going to work and how maintaining your insulin levels and eating the RIGHT carbs is the true key to long life and keeping the weight off.  I now look at \\"Lean Cuisines\\" and have mixed emotions.  I laugh because I now know that these so called weight loss foods are actually making people fat and I know better than to touch them.  I also become angry because the rest of America is being lied to and there's nothing I can really do about it.      My wife thanks you too.  She's not into working out that much, nor have I ever been able to get her to touch the \\"calories in/ calories out\\" dieting method.   I had her listen (I got the audiobook of this instead of reading it) to some of the key chapters about what makes us fat after the history lesson near the middle of the book.  She hates anything diet related, so she was very skeptical.  I am happy to say that she said that it made a lot of sense to her too and that she would work with me on trying this new way of eating.  She is also now a true believer!  My wife is a beautiful woman.  She was starting to struggle a little and starting to go from a 4 to a 6 in women's sizes.  When she was younger she was a 2 and even a zero in some stores.  She was starting to become unhappy with this gain, but really didn't know what to do about it.  This new way of eating has changed all of that.  We just went to White House/ Black Market the other day and she is consistently a TWO again!  She couldn't believe how much weight she's lost in only two months time!  This way of eating really does work for both genders!      Please everyone, quit starving yourself, read (or listen) to this book and change your life too!      One last recommendation:  You'll wanta cookbook after reading this.  I'd recommend \\"The Good Carb Cookbook,\\" \\"Sugar Busters,\\" and \\"The Glycemic Load Cookbook.\\"  It follows the same principles in this book and has some very good recipes and ideas.      As a closing remark, This way of eating IS NOT HARD AT ALL and I DO still eat bread and sweets.  I am, however, more conscientious of the affects they have on me and I limit them in my meals as a result.  Thank you again Mr. Taubes.  You've changed my life, my wife's life, and one day the life of my children.
1590305515|5.0|I didn't know what this book was before someone started playing this CD of it on a vacation. It was a beautiful story, and the man who read it did so perfectly. I see that a lot of these reviews say this version of the translation is awkward or just bad, but on CD it sounds very beautiful. (This IS the CD version I'm reviewing, right? It says so at the top of the page..) It definitely would not have sounded this good in my own mental voice. It's honestly the best book-reading I've ever heard, and worthy of the story, I think.<br /><br />Also, a note to teachers: please stop making your students read books like this. I would have been bored with it in high school too, I'm sure. People who want to learn will be able to learn from any well-written book, even if it has no obvious \\"message\\". Just pick a fun book, it will be more likely to inspire your students to read and think. They will find this book when they're older, if they want.

Pictures online do not fully display all of the shine, and glamor this watch displays.  I was fortunate to be able to get this watch at a lower price then currently being displayed here in the Famous _bay site.  But since I read and write all of my reviews here, I had to come back to Amazon.<br />I've had this watch on my wish list for about 2 years, but didn't buy it untill Thursday 4-7-11. This watch is really amazing. Like others have mentioned, there is a weight to it, like all good watches should have.<br />The second hand is a nice yellow, that stands out against the black face, but still very dressy watch.<br /><br /> I will keep this review updated, to let everyone know how the watch peforms with time.

B003Y5H5KQ|3.0|A young girl has been raised by her father to have the skills of an assassin. He is a former CIA operative, and is trying to elude the agency. The girl must meet up with her dad, while trying to evade capture. Hanna avoids becoming a run-of-the-mill action drama because of the strong performances is it two female leads, and also due to the musical score. The pulsating beats of drums and synthesizers punctuate the action, giving the film a hip and contemporary feel. The sometimes implausible feats of the girl can be overlooked due to her superb acting. She bonds with a young girl traveling with her family, and this relationship is quite endearing
B0002VK66U|5.0|This is a cd that I listen to constantly. Great music! If you are a Rainbow fan and like 80s music like Foreigner, this is for you. He's got a great voice and he's one of my two favorite rock vocalists (the other being Lou Gramm. Every single song is good, but the first four are fantastic. This is Joe at his best.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|Good story idea, good screenplay, good actors, and good city.<br />You too; take part as \\"Tourist\\" in this adventure.<br /><br />If you can, try to watch it on a Philips 21:9 screen to enjoy the beautiful town of Venice...and not only,<br />have a drink face to face with Angelina and Johnny like never before!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Perfect! Shows the original show looking better than ever. 5.1 surround sound is excellent, and a lot better than that of its Blu Ray counter part. The extras are amazing especially one documentary not many people seem to comment on which is 'Star Trek: Beyond the Final Frontier' 1 hour and a half long hosted by Leonard Nimoy. This plus much more makes this box set truly amazing, a well worth buying.

1439102724|1.0|(Warning: plot spoiler)    As a conservative, I've read plenty of books that bash conservatives and praise liberalism (Baldacci comes to mind).  And, I have enjoyed many Jodi Picoult books.  But this one jumps the shark for me, with its liberal agendas, stereotypes, and biases.    The story starts as one of a hurting couple who want to have children but can't; the wife has several miscarriages.    It changes quickly to a story of female friendship and then romantic love between the two women who then get married and go to court to use the embryos from the marriage to impregnate the main character's female lover - something the ex-husband is against.    Jodi Picoult uses frequent unflattering stereotype about Christianity, men, conservatives, and even country music (which she writes off as songs about losing jobs and women being compared to tractors, while praising all other music genres.  I mean, really?  You have to disparage country music?  Rap is found by the character to be poetic, about social issues, a long tradition from a specific culture.  Would a music therapist really not know that the exact same can be said about country music?).      Of course the characters watch Anderson Cooper, Brian Williams, and Jon Stewart.  All of the gay characters are portrayed as superior, wise, emotionally healthy.  The co-worker at school who was raised by 2 moms is specifically noted to be heterosexual, athletic and well-rounded.  But Christians and the main male character are mocked and portrayed as extremists.  When the main character's ex-husband Max gives up an alcohol addiction for Christ and tells his ex-wife that she'd be happier with Jesus, she says \\"Who are you?\\" and wishes for the \\"flawed but more fun\\" alcoholic version of Max.    Could this story not have been told without repeatedly knocking the other side?  In real life these issues are not black and white.  I found them very black and white in this book.    The irony of liberal elitists comes through loud andclear in this book: the author, believing herself tolerant, shows throughout the book intolerance and disdain for Christians and straight men.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's taken a little longer to post this review than I expected it would.  That's mainly because I wasn't able to stop after reading Suzanne Collins' first novel in this series.  \\"The Hunger Games\\" is the first in the trilogy that carries over into \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\".  It's the story of Katniss Everdeen, a seventeen year old girl who becomes a tribute in the Hunger Games, a twisted gladiatorial competition in which two tributes from each of Panem's twelve districts are forced to participate.  It is an annually televised \\"reality show\\" wherein the twenty-four tributes are forced to battle each other to the death in an acres-wide arena filled with deadly terrain, genetically engineered flora and fauna, and mobile traps designed to move the action along for the viewers when things get too boring.<br /><br />The setting is a dystopian future in which global warming and wars have decimated much of the world, and a corrupt government has taken its lessons from ancient Rome - distract the populace with enough blood to entertain them, and remind them of who's in charge.  At the same time, keep them impoverished and oppressed, convinced that they're lucky to receive the dregs left behind by the Capital.<br /><br />By the end of the first book, Katniss realizes that she's become a pawn in a plot that is much larger than the Games.  She learns to play for the cameras, and the hearts of the viewers, and through them, perhaps change the very fabric of her society.  I won't give spoilers here, but I will say that even though the story is written as a young adult novel, it is darker than most YA fiction I've read, and entertaining enough to keep this fifty year old kid engaged.  It alternates between multilayered plotlines that are in places rather simplistic, and in others quite thought-provoking.<br /><br />Since this review is specifically for the first book, \\"The Hunger Games\\", I won't go into the other two books in the trilogy.  I couldn't do so anyway without spoiling some of the plotlines of the first book.  All I will say is that Suzanne Collins is an author I will be supporting by buying more of her work.  I highly recommend this entire series.  I give it four out of five stars.otlines of the first book.

Loved the  happy ending and enjoyed watching the second time more than the first.  The price  was better than buying it at a retail outlet and the service was exceptional.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|Pros        Light weight, minimalistic looks, well built, nice consistant sound, worth the price.    Cons      Wish it was more compatible with today's cell phones. No way to answer calls while listening to your music.    I'm no audiophile, but just received them from Fedex, and on 1st impressions they sound really good. Using it on my Iphone4, and without the EQ set to on, the sound is very clean with lot's of unassisted Bass. Music genre I listen to is mostly R&B, HipHop with POP mixed in. Will get more detailed in the future.
1591843790|5.0|A great book from someone who has been there and done that. If you want to learn how to Enchant others, share your vision and use technology to Enchant people then this is the resource you have been looking for.    I especially like the fact that Guy has done this. He isn't giving you a concept that he thinks might work. No, this is filled information about how Guy has done it and continues to do it today. Guy focuses on the positives and how it applies in today's business climate.    What a great book to get you fired up. Read it, you will not be disappointed.
0316056863|4.0|I love Tina Fey, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed \\"Bossypants\\" as much as I did. This book can't really be called a complete memoir...more of the best of Tina's life, with a few stories about her childhood and then stories about her career, and then some random chapters about beauty and fame and motherhood. I really liked the book, which is extremely funny and self-deprecating. My one criticism is that the book seemed to be all over the place. The chapters weren't always in chronological order, and then it seemed like Tina ran out of things to share about her life and started writing advice chapters for women. Everything was amusing and fun to read, but I think the book could have been a bit more organized. All in all, though, if you like Tina Fey, you will enjoy this book very much.
0345522478|5.0|They are publishing this first book of the series along with the next 2 books, Hexed & Hammered.  I enjoyed a preview read of Hounded sufficiently to preorder both of the following books of the series.  Atticus O'Sullivan is a likable protagonist, apparently a young man with an interest in odd books.  He is in fact a remarkably ancient druid, with friends - and enemies - in unlikely places.  I enjoyed his strength: he isn't one of those heroes who gets beaten badly and frequently until the last second when something suddenly happens to save him despite his weaknesses.  Atticus is a plan-ahead, take charge, go-for-broke kind of guy with a \\"no brag, just fact\\" quiet, heroic personality.  His friendship with his neighbor, an old lady with a genteel exterior hiding a kick-ass granny, is a lot of fun.    This is not a deadly serious, end-of-the-world drama.  No, it is more of a delightfully droll, potential end-of-the-world drama, with Atticus available to foil the bad guys.

0393338827|5.0|I don't normally review business literature but Michael Lewis' account of the 2008 Wall Street Collapse was so well rendered in his book, \\"The Big Short,\\" that I felt compelled to review it for its succinct description of a complex phenomenon and because Lewis achieves a literary voice and psychological depth more akin to literary fiction than financial analysis.  He is a smooth, clear, imaginative writer who conveys the facts as well as the psychological underpinnings of the banking system debacle.  In doing so, he portrays several key figures whose personalities and grit drove the bust and profited from it, as well as others whose insights could provide fodder to statesmen initiating regulatory reform.  If capitalism is to survive without continued erosion of the middle class, restrictions must be devised to protect investors, home purchasers, insurance companies and the stock market in general.  Everything must be done to assure that there are no incentives to bet against what these institutions stand for.  If shorting is widespread, the country suffers.  With so much at stake in the world of economics and so many members of the workplace identifying with global institutions rather than America per se, policies must be put in place to assure sound business practices that benefit America rather than encourage fraud, manipulation and greed.<br /><br />In identifying the fraud of sub-prime mortgages as a primary cause for the collapse, Lewis employs the metaphor of one lonely, somewhat anti-social neurologist interning at Stanford University Hospital.  Dr. Michael Burry symbolizes the fallacies of the stock market in general as well as the housing bubble's destructive yet predictable course.  In characterizing Burry, Lewis suggests the hubris necessary either to manipulate the market or to expect to profit from it.  After all, Burry was a genius endowed with intellectual capabilities most of us do not have - an understanding that was clearly lacking in the major Wall Street firms.  Burry realized early on that a housing crisis loomed due to the widespread practice of sub-prime loans and their shadowy, insubstantial backing by bonds that were equally complicated and flimsy.  Assured that the housing market could not sustain itself, he sought a way to bet against the sub-prime mortgages.  An intern with long hours, he was a busy man, but his obsession with the world of investing drove him to reading the legalese of sub-prime loan documents and thereby devising a plan to profit from the impending housing crisis.<br /><br />By 2005 no one would sell loans on sub-prime mortgages because the interest rates would eventually climb as the number of bank defaults on sub-prime mortgages increased.  So Burry convinced Morgan Stanley, Deutche Bank and Goldman-Sachs to sell him credit default swaps  that would serve as insurance against losses resulting from the dubious practice of sub-prime mortgage lending.  In the process, he lost several of his clients who feared his unorthodox practices.  While his clients were unwilling to invest their money as a tool for Burry's betting short, it was Burry's grasp of the inevitability of the housing crisis that drove him to switch directions in his investing protocol.  As it turned out, he made millions for his clients and himself by betting against Wall Street.  The metaphor here, while it cannot be separated from the idea of American ego, clearly suggests that the typical speculative investor should heed the warning that not all of us are as intelligent and as driven as  a Michael Burry.  As Lewis so deftly points out, none of our financial institutions possessed his insight.<br /><br />Lewis brilliantly juxtaposes Burry's monomaniacal search for the perfect investment opportunity with his gradual understanding of his own mysterious, complex personality.  Burry had always assumed that his intellectual gifts were the result of his having lost an eye to a rare kind of cancer when he was a child.  Dueto his physical handicap, he did not look people in the eye, was regarded as different and found himself more interested in his own intellectual pursuits than cultivating associates.  A loner, his obsessive interest with the financial world drove him to understand what Lewis admits, that he, a stockbroker, Princeton graduate, hedge fund operator himself, did not.  In one of the most interesting passages in the book, Lewis describes how the intelligent, critical thinking graduates of Ivy League colleges secure employment in large investment firms, having never mastered the rudiments of accounting and thereby proceed to carry out their jobs without an understanding of the complex world of high finance they inhabit.  Again and again, Lewis exposes the lack of knowledge those who run Wall Street epitomize, from the lenders, to the hedge fund managers, the analysts/appraisers at Moody's and Standard and Poors, to the heads of large investment firms such as Goldman-Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bear-Stearns.  Burry understood the system's fallacies while they did not so he obsessively proceeded to grasp the paradoxes of the marketplace until he was ready to quit medicine and start up his own investment company, Scion.<br /><br />Interestingly enough Michael Burry went to medical school because it was easy for him, not because he was dedicated to medicine.  In fact, hospital life both bored him and disgusted him.  Instead high finance had always been his interest, even though his own father discouraged involvement in the stock market.  When his father died, he founded Scion and proceeded to do what he wanted with his life.  Early on he realized that \\"no one could teach you how to invest.\\"  It was a talent he felt he had and so he pursued it.  Thus, the metaphor of Burry as well as Lewis' tendency to portray characters in depth transforms what could be a dull read into a psychologically compelling experience.<br /><br />Joel Greenblatt among others encouraged Burry and invested in his company.  Others were to follow Burry's lead in purchasing credit default swaps to ameliorate the losses of sub-prime mortgages.  Burry's M.O. was to pick the worst of the sub-prime mortgages and bet against them with the purchase of credit default swaps.  Goldman-Sachs and other firms failed to understand why he continued to purchase swaps.  And although housing delinquencies hit an all time high and thus Burry's protocol made sense monetarily, his own investors were fearful of his practice of betting against the housing market.  Yet Wall Street was slowly waking up; by 2007 sub-prime mortgage defaults were at an all time high, with Bear-Stearns going under and Goldman-Sachs experiencing major losses.  At this time Burry's own investors were making a profit of almost 500% but they still did not trust him.  This fact illustrated the basic lack of confidence some people had in Burry.  This lack of trust Burry attributed to his inability to look people in the eye.  While Burry clearly understood the casino-like nature of investing in sub-prime mortgage bonds and derivatives, others, including the magnates on Wall Street, had no idea of the insubstantiality of their practices and proceeded to game the system, as did Burry, yet Burry and a few others understood the system while most major players did not.<br /><br />At the height of the financial crisis, Burry realized that his son had Asperger's Syndrome.  The more he thought about it, his son's diagnosis explained his own personality as well.  When he acknowledged that, he began to understand the strange compulsions that had driven him to make sense of the financial world.  In realizing his obsession, he is a metaphor for the individual whose visionary characteristics can be instrumental in drastic paradigm shifts.  Thus is Michael Burry a hero to Lewis and others who study the market.  Through understanding his actions and by interviewing him, Lewis and others acknowledged the genius of this lone wolf whosebrain should be picked to seal off the holes in predatory lending and investing practices that if unchecked, could drive our nation to ruin.<br /><br />By clarifying Wall Street practices and explaining such speculative ventures as \\"tranches,\\" Lewis makes clear, not only the risks of investing for the ordinary man whose skills are not advanced and whose knowledge of the intricacies of finance is not honed, but also the greed and predatory systems that exist to maintain Wall Street dominance.  In this regard, Wall Street institutions obscured what needed to be clarified in a self-serving attempt to preserve themselves at the cost of individual investors as well as the American people.  As Burry observed, Wall Street standards had not just deteriorated but were non-existent.  By amortizing sub-prime mortgages at adjustable rates, Wall Street had created a disastrous real estate bubble which the American tax payer would have to absorb if the financial system was to survive.  Burry believed lending institutions should show restraint.  Yet they clearly were not doing so, instead betting against their own loans to assure profits.  In his view it was not only an immoral system but ultimately an unsustainable one.  As Burry predicted, it resulted in the tanking of the American economy even as it solidified Goldman-Sachs and other questionable entities.<br /><br />Lewis points out that in the middle of the crisis, most Wall Street firms were tottering on the brink of collapse.  \\"The world's most powerful and highly paid financiers had been entirely discredited; without government intervention every single one of them would have lost his job, and yet those same financial advisers that had steered America to collapse were still using the government to enrich themselves,\\" Lewis points out.  He quotes Burry, \\"What I can't understand is why anyone would listen to them.\\"<br /><br />Steve Eisman, another interesting and prime player in the debacle, exposed the deceptions of dozens of companies, calling the Household Finance Corporation's practices \\"blatant fraud.\\"  Said Eisman, \\"Wall Street didn't give a s--- what it sold.\\"  Moreover, Eisman claimed \\"Greenspan will go down as the worst head of the Federal Reserve in history.\\"  By using quotes and taking the time to fully portray the characters in this dismal scenario, Lewis makes the book of complex financial practices clear and interesting because we see real people involved in the process.  The Eisman Lewis depicts was a rude man, so people were reluctant to listen to him.  But as Lewis makes clear it was Eisman's brilliance that permitted him to realize that \\"gambling and investing is artificial and thin.\\"  Driven by greed, claims Lewis, most players fail to understand the complexity of the practices they promote.  It is not tenable for the less than brilliant to venture into such an arcane world as speculative investments  --  sub-prime mortgage bonds, CDO's or credit default swaps.  It takes a genius to know what you're doing in such a complicated situation.  Most fall prey to Group Think, which is the pattern of Investment Banking in general.  One has to watch out for the sharks, but also for the stupid or uninformed.<br /><br />Thus is the significance of the message Lewis delivers to those who will listen.  Let us hope Lewis is not the Cassandra of America, warning of economic destruction while no one listens.  This is a book to take to heart, to insist your children and friends read and read again.  It is intelligent, heartfelt, wise, and literary.  Reading it will sober anyone as to the risks we so unwittingly take on as part of our cultural heritage.  The obvious lesson of this book is to avoid wading into deep waters if your swimming expertise is marginal.  There are some things most of us are not equipped to understand but our insufferable egos drive us on and on to failure and loss.

B001YV506S|5.0|Whether you judge it by its genre or the quality of of its Blu ray incarnation it's a 5 star offering.  I am not generally a sports film fan, but I was most pleasantly rewarded for my investment in this particular case.  This is a real Blu ray stunner in picture and sound, and in this case the film itself, apart from being of showcase quality, is a real \\"upper\\" without the Hollywood treacle on top.  There are a number of extras, some of which are actually interesting - so I suppose that this package is a no brainer.

B004EQAVFU|4.0|After seeing this film, you may well feel like the famous Prince of Denmark in one of his less optimistic moods.  Whilst this is really no masterpiece, it is a most interesting, and above all else, disturbing experience to watch.  I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons here, but taken on its own, as I have, it will, or should, leave you with profound misgivings about what we have come to accept as unquestionable the benefits of transplant surgery.<br />Although the film is presented in dystopian garb, it is all to easy to imagine such a nightmare coming true in the darker fringes of the world. Without wishing to reveal much of the plot, I feel bound to say that the idea of cloning apparently willing organ donors is not that far removed from the seduction of a nation's youth to go and die on the battlefield, as happened in the First World War. Here we have the idea of voluntary sacrifice taken to a grisly extreme.<br />This is not a film for the faint-hearted nor anyone looking for a bit of entertainment. It is a dour, troubling and depressing experience, but none the less valuable for that. It is deliberately slow, but is a highly atmospheric film, in which you will find no tour de force of acting.  What you will find is some impressive photography which serves well to emphasize the bleakness of the theme.  It is a serious, minority film with a serious message, which certainly ranks above average, yet perhaps because of its very nature falls short of 5 stars. As far as the Blu ray version is concerned, it offers some stunning landscapes in a muted palate, which are every bit as impressive as some of the more \\"Technicolor\\" type films, where Blu ray clearly excels.

You feel everything mia is going through so throughly, I went through a roller-coaster of emotions.   When I first read about this book I wasn't sure, but I kept hearing such great things I just had to give it a read,  I was instantly hooked. I loved every single second of it. At the end I really though I was going to loose it   because you really have no idea how its going to end. I was anxious, nervous and scared all at the same time,   It had me on the edge of my seat! And thank god there is a 2nd book! and i just finished that and I still don't want it to be over.

B003L20ICE|3.0|A good premise to this film, and some good acting, notably by Mark Ruffalo, an actor I have never particularly liked because he seems very by-the-numbers, using the same bag of tricks. But there is a huge problem with the film, and that is the relationship between Bening and Moore is simply not believeable. They don't at all come off as lesbians, which is a pretty neat trick to pull since lesbians come in many shapes and sizes. Never for a second did I believe they were gay, never for a second did I believe they were in love. And there were some bits that were silly; the sex scenes were poorly done; Bening's and Moore's concern that their son might be gay was stretched out far far too much and not even funny. As for any discussion of a concern for a gay son (by two lesbian mothers) the script did nothing with that. Did nothing with the daughter's sexuality, where she was with that. Only Ruffalo's character was defined, the film could have given and been a whole lot more.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Okay, so I have watched this movie about four times since it has been released on dvd and most of the time I fall asleep or become preoccupied with something else.

Enjoy!
B004NSULHM|3.0|I keep hearing worshippers of Radiohead implore the band's critics to look past the music to appreciate its deeper meaning, to grasp the nuances of Radiohead's profound message. Here's the deeper meaning of King of Limbs, as far as I can tell. The new music industry is dead, having been killed by Napster as the movie, The Social Network, points out. Radiohead now looks forward to a world in which music is created without a viable business model. (Most of the money in music comes from CD sales, not from concerts.) In that world, music ought to be disposable to punish the thieving fans who don't value art enough to pay for it. Thus, with the faster songs on this new CD, Radiohead is giving people what they secretly want or at least what they deserve: worthless, vacuous, disposable, easily-forgotten anti-music. King of Limbs is largely a neo-Muzak dirge for new music.      Why try hard to create fresh and inspiring melodies when the consumers' actions indicate that the consumers don't care, even though they may hypocritically say otherwise? We're so decadent and infantilized that we expect new music for free, to flow from the internet to our MP3 players like water from the ocean. Why should artists suffer in their creative processes to cater to spoiled consumers who soon won't even know what we're missing, because our attention span is vanishingly small and we've got a hole where our memory should be?     Of course, art appreciation is mostly subjective. As the philosopher Daniel Dennett likes to say, humans are excellent pattern detectors. You can find what you like in any pattern at all, so fans of Radiohead will have no trouble seeing in this new release what they want to find. It's like John Edwards' psychic shenanigans, which are really just a game of 20 questions: the questioned people do most of the associative work in their own heads, and the questioner just ties things up with a nice bow. Different sounds will resonate with different people, depending on the unique, labyrinthine neural connections we bring with us.      But music's ability to evoke emotions is more objective, since that requires tapping into an older, more universal and hardwired part of our brain. That's why horror movies use the same kind of skin-crawling sounds to evoke fear, while romantic movies use soaring violins to evoke cathartic feelings of love. The main feeling evoked by the fast songs on King of Limbs is boredom, which is what we deserve for adoring the new communications technologies that are fatal to art.      Is this intentional on Radiohead's part? Does the band loathe its fans? Of course not. But the meaning of art goes beyond either the artist's intentions or the consumer's idiosyncratic interpretations. The ultimate meaning has to do with where the art fits into a society that has reached a particular stage. Unfortunately, American-led society is in decline, and meaningful art in that society speaks to that decline.     There's another factor too. Artists do their best work when they're young and desperate, not when they're older and successful. Thus, artists are microcosms of societies in that they each pass through stages of vitality and of corruption.    ****    After listening to KOL a number of times more after my initial review, the last few songs on the CD have grown on me, so I've changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars. I'm still unhappy with the faster songs on the CD: they're not as memorable as the fast ones from other Radiohead CDs, they don't rock, and they don't go anywhere. Here's a song-by-song reflection.     Bloom - This is one of the more interesting songs on the CD, in my view. I like the chirping that sounds like a flock of birds in the middle of the third minute, and the violins and horn background. So as an atmospheric song with no melody, it's pretty good; it holds my attention and I expect it will do so after repeated listening.    Morning Mr Magpie - By contrast, this song is boring: no interesting instruments,and just the repetitive chanting of mantras (as opposed to the singing of a melody) with muted drums.     Little by little - Like most songs on KOL, this song's variations happen within narrow parameters. The song has no beginning, middle, or end, and instead of a melody, the song is made up of chanting with some percussive accompaniment. The song isn't horrible, but I can't imagine being interested in listening to it over and over again. That's the same as saying that the song already begins to bore me.    Feral - A throwaway filler song on a really short CD, the objectively worst on KOL. Experimental, nonsensical, repetitive, atmospheric noises that vary within narrow parameters and go nowhere. I won't want to listen to this song over and over again, unlike most Radiohead songs.    Lotus Flower - Compared to the faster songs on Radiohead's other, recent CDs, this song doesn't rock and it's not as memorable. The song's not boring, but it's not powerful either.    Codex - A fine song, although perhaps a lesser version of Piano Song. Unlike the faster songs on KOL, this one isn't a disposable digital mess for thieving fans.      Give up the mess - A great transition near the end, and I like the way Yorke distorts some of his singing to sound like the big horns they blow in Tibetan monasteries.     Seperator - This song has hooked me after repeated listening.     Again, after repeated listening, I've come to like some of the songs on KOL, but I still don't think this CD is as good as any of Radiohead's other CDs, because of its inconsistency and brevity (only 8 songs).
B002ZG976U|5.0|I just love love love this movie with Cher and Christina.  They did a great job acting and of course all the singing and dancing.  I love it so much that I watch it everyday.  The outfits everyone wears are beautiful and sexy.  The guys and other girls are so talented.   If you love music and dancing you will definitely love Burlesque.....Enjoy it!!!
B003XRZZFM|5.0|If you consider yourself a Black Metal purist this album is not for you. If you are looking for a fresh sound in extreme metal and have no genre allegiances, this album is a must have.     Abrahadabra is filled with memorable epic moments that stay with you long after you stop listening. The production of this record is very polished & clean. Dimmu paints a sonic landscape that is darkly symphonic, powerfully sinister and monolithic in scale.    Many Metal bands have attempted to integrate symphonics into their music, but it ends up sounding either forced, badly arranged, cheap, or the mix in the production is just awful; but Dimmu pulls it off. The symphonic elements actually sound organic and real rather than just a guy pushing keys on $90 keyboard. I think many bands (like Epica) have symphonics that remind me of an 8bit NES video game, rather than a real, organic, larger than life orchestra.     I hope you find this review helpful, whether it leads you away from the album or towards it. The key to these reviews isn't only to give accolades toward a record, but also to ward away people who won't be happy with it. So in case I haven't given strong enough caution to my Black Metal purist friends... You wont like this CD. I promise.
1439133948|2.0|I've read nearly all of Bujold's books and enthusiastically recommend her as an author.  This was interesting to a point but seemed to be kind of formulaic and rushed towards the end.  If you skip this one, you won't miss much, but definitely read her other titles.
0380789035|3.0|So many reviews are summed up with the phrase \\"a great story, wonderfully told.\\" I found this to be not so great a story, but so wonderfully told that it didn't stop me from reading. Too much of How The World Works is left unexplained, or contradicted by the story itself, or with a great big theological hole large enough to drive Orson Welles through. History gets mucked with for no apparent reason. Some echoes of other writers and other stories were recognizable and hence distracting (e.g., Zelazny's \\"Lord of Light\\" and \\"Creatures of Light and Darkness,\\" and Tim Powers' \\"Last Call\\" especially).<br /><br />But like I said, and worth repeating: wonderfully told. Great cast of characters, great canvas, moving myth-making.
0800141660|3.0|As far as following the story, I think this adaptation did a decent job following the book.  There were a few changes that I couldn't figure out why they did them, but they were minor. (why change Edward's engagement to Lucy from 4 to 5 years?  Does it matter?)  That said, everyone was too old for the characters that they were playing.  Also, with the exception of Alan Rickman, the acting was stilted and forced.  I never was convinced I was watching a story unfold before my eyes.  I was definitely watching a fictional movie.  Alan Rickman's performance as Col. Brandon redeemed this movie from 2 to 3 stars.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I have noticed two consistent components in Michael Connelly's works. First, he thoroughly plans his story before he writes. Other writers, it seems to me, often write as they go. That is, it appears that their story shifts significantly at some point well after the beginning, and the author, perhaps, is too lazy or too rushed to go back and carefully realign. How often have you encountered characters or plot developments in fiction land that are introduced and then abandoned?  I see none of this in Connelly's novels, dating back to the first Harry Bosch books.     Another common trait is that the author drops a clue early on in the novel that readers may at first see as significant, but may neglect as the story progresses. I know I have missed such clues in Connelly's works.  There's a stunning development late in this novel that fits this pattern.     A key figure in Fifth Witness is Lisa Trammel. She is in danger of losing her home, caught up in the foreclosure mess that has plagued the country in recent years. She and her husband purchased a home that was likely well beyond their means in 2005. The loan included a massive balloon payment due in five years. When Trammel's husband disappeared, her sole income as a teacher is not enough to keep her, her young son, and her expensive home afloat. She can't cover the balloon payment. She fights the foreclosure process because she is unable to refinance due to her home's plummeting value. Trammel becomes an outspoken advocate for those who are fighting foreclosure. She attracts significant media attention.    Enter Mickey Haller, the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" who has become the leading character in recent Connelly books.(Harry Bosch has a micro cameo appearance here.) Haller has shifted from criminal law to representing people who are fighting foreclosure. There are legions of them across the country. These foreclosures often involve deceptive/fraudulent practices that a skillful lawyer like Haller can uncover and use to his clients' advantage. One of Haller's clients is Lisa Trammel. Haller was her attorney when she was arrested and charged with the murder of Mitchell Bondurant, senior vice president of the mortgage company that holds Trammel's note. Trammel may hate Bondurant, but did she murder him? That is the question.    I don't want to reveal anything about Haller's investigation of the murder or about the trial. It's all fascinating. I did not find an extraneous word in the book. And there's that smashing twist at the end alluded to above. I don't think I'll ever forget the resolution Connelly invents for a pivotal trial issue.    Another strong point is the spin that Connelly puts on the classic lawyer rationale for defending those who are actually guilty of the crime. The chant is: Actual guilt or innocence is not important. The accused must be found guilty in a court of law.  I have always had a hard time accepting this rationale when lawyers grow wealthy representing  immoral, vicious people. Connelly's analysis of all of this is the best that I have encountered in fiction land.    If you have read this far into this review you may wonder what the review's title means. I assure you that it will become clear as you finish the novel.
1591843162|5.0|Tons of great new principles in this book, not just idealogical but very practical. This book has CHANGED the way I work and affected other areas of my life day-to-day, not just the way I work but live. Thanks Seth Godin. I am now a big fan.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|If you are interested in knowing what is going on, in general, behind the curtain of our government, then you should see this movie.  If you choose to be blind, then don't bother.
B001152TL6|5.0|I saw my first Lynch film last fall (Mulholland Dr) and quickly became fascinated with this perplexing, warped and brilliant director. His earlier work, such as Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, presents an interesting mix of campy melodrama and brutally violent realism, which is interesting but somewhat jarring as the two formulas don't quite seem to compliment each other.<br /><br />Lost Highway is a different kind of Lynch film, completely consistent in tone and (I would argue) coherent in structure and philosophy. I haven't seen Fire Walk With Me, but it's clear that Lynch took a major step forward between Wild at Heart and this one. Lost Highway moves slowly but steadily, weaving a sense of foreboding that doesn't let up even when the worst has apparently happened. The tension is unremitting, and even the humor (in a neat trick that is distinctly Lynchian) does nothing to alleviate the sense of menace.<br /><br />There are a lot of different interpretations of the story, but the one I find most convincing is that we are watching the main character's mind construct a fantasy to protect him from the knowledge that he killed his wife, while an uglier but more honest part of his mind tries to shove that very same fact into his face. There is not necessarily a right answer, but I think this one explains a lot of things very elegantly. In any case, there are plenty of clues in the film to help you form a coherent idea of what it's about, and as long as you enjoy this sort of challenge I think you'll enjoy Lost Highway as well.
0743201140|1.0|I purchased this book used through Amazon only to discover that for the book to be useful, you have to do an online Strength Finder Profile. The problem is that each book contains a SINGLE code that is only good for ONE USER! So if the original book owner used the code, you won't be able to, and the majority of the book will be meaningless to you because you can't do the profile. I felt completely ripped off when I discovered this! It would be easy for the publisher to note this on the cover so people would know before purchasing, but they don't, so I hold them responsible. They also don't provide or sell additional codes for a fee. I couldn't use the book for its intended purpose therefore it gets only one star.
0812973992|2.0|After hearing all the positive, glowing reviews of this book, I wanted to read it myself. I was sorely disappointed. What a mess. It starts out interesting enough to grab your attention, but it quickly deteriorates. By page 200 or so I realized that it wasn't going to get any better. I read another 30 pages or so and wanted to finish it for the sake of finishing it, but I couldn't force myself to do it. The book's focus shifts primarily to Tillie, the washed-up hooker. Am I supposed to care? Am I supposed to feel sorry for her? The message by this point seems to be that she became a hooker because, poor thing, she didn't have a choice. Please. Don't be fooled: this book has more to do with the seedy underbelly of prostitution in NYC than anything else. I did find the storyline of the mother of the Vietnam vet slightly compelling, but so little of the book focused on that. Don't bother reading this book; it will only be a waste of your time. NOT recommended!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, it's a very fun ride filled with super hot girls, awesome guns and utterly amazing visuals. The dream worlds are amazing. Extremely enjoyable and entertaining movie.    I think people who hate this movie had expectations that were too high. It's Hollywood, guys. If you want something very challenging and intellectual, you should read a book instead of going to watch an action movie. Or, you can do both; there's always a place for intelligent literature as well as a place for entertaining flicks. Both can and should be enjoyed.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I had rented the movie from Family Video saw part of the movie because the video started breaking up when she was on the plane. Which made me so angry and I thought I would get another copy and the same thing happened so I have desided that I am going to buy the movie just to see the ending without the interruption. I loved the first part of the movie and I just had to see the rest of the movie not just because I love Irish men but because I love love stories, tenderness and anything about true love not this flings and short term relationships but real true love. This is what this movie is truely about real genuine love long lasting love. Something we should all study and follow up with to make this world a better place.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I did recieve the DVD on time, the case was damaged and the seller (Robin) added another movie for my trouble which was great.  I informed Robin that the movie she sent as a courtesy did work she stated she'd send another one. It has been 3 weeks and no movie yet!!!     Thanks alot Robin, I guess it was the thought that counted!!!!!
B000P0J09W|2.0|What a disappointment for this old movie to skip several times throughout the movie.    I would return it, but it's a pain to go through that process...
0399250573|5.0|I have read several of the reviews and noticed \\"disappointed\\" popping up quite often.  If you are looking for a Disney, everyone is happy ending, then yes-you will be disappointed. If you are looking for an authentic ending to a teenager's career as a spy, involving saving the world nine times in one year, then read it.    The story telling alone was amazing. I had thought I was past the time in my life of reading a thick novel in two days. Apparently, I had not picked one up as well written and woven with suspense as \\"Scorpia Rising.\\" Each chapter gave me a reason to continue until I was in the climax, screaming from suspense and knowing that, despite my wishes to savor the last Alex Rider book, I had to finish it. Now.    ****SPOILERS IN REVIEW***    As with all the Alex Rider books, the story follows the basic plot-first chapter murder, villain out to get the world or England, MI6 has a lead that they need Alex to follow, Alex is caught up in the whirr of things and meets the villain face to face, etc. As essential to Alex as a murder is to a murder mystery.  But this time Anthony Horowitz threw in a twist. We begin by following the villain for several chapters as he lays out a trap for MI6, or more specifically, for Alex Rider. The beginning, although I was itching to get to Alex, was refreshing. It set the mood for the rest of the story. I wanted to scream at Alex, and MI6, for falling into their plan all during the rest of the story.    Anthony Horowitz had said several things about this book-he would kill off a character that had been in all of the books and that Alex would end up worse than dead.  *****EXTRA SPOILER*****  Throughout the book, I was continually wondering who would die. I knew it would not be Alex, I didn't care if it was Blunt, so that left three people who could die that I would care about-Mrs. Jones, Smithers, and Jack. Don't let it be Jack....please? It was. I hoped that her death was faked, but knowing the villain, it could not be, and itwas not.  I cannot imagine Mr. Horowitz rubbing his hands with glee as he killed a favorite character-I believe it was as hard for him to write as it was for me to read. The death was well written, and necessary almost, considering where the story had gone. It would be too happy if all his loved ones-Jack, Sabina and family, and friends-had made it unscathed through his adventures. And, besides preventing Alex from a horrible death or at the least, becoming a cripple for the rest of his life, it was the moment when he changed from the boy spy to a \\"grown up\\" spy.  He would never spy again. No matter what.  The end was a relief. I was so happy for Alex to be able to leave England behind, MI6 behind, and finally have the most normal life possible with Sabina. He needed that. The readers needed hope that Alex will not commit suicide or sit in a daze for the rest of his life.  Due to the death, his age, his size, and the fact that he slipped up a few times, Alex will not spy anymore.  *****END SPOILERS****    I think that this book was a perfect ending for the series. Darker, yes, but that is part of the point. Spying is not for kids, it never should have been. Considering what I had imagined would happen to Alex, I was slightly relieved. And Anthony Horowitz allowed us some hope for Alex, but not for any more Alex Rider Spy books. This book surpassed the last one and is up with my top favorites-Scorpia, Snakehead, and Skeleton Key.    Oh, and by the way, Smither's gadget is amazing. The best. You will know what I am talking about when you read it.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This was a great purchase.  I bought it second hand, and it has been holding up, which speaks well of its durability.  It works well for putting the little one to sleep with the lights out, but it also entertains him for quite some time when he is awake.  He loves the music (at first he spent most of the time staring towards the speaker, smiling and cooing), and a plus is that the music, though electronic, manages not to be irritating to us the parents (we have to hear it through baby monitor when we are out of the room).  The three options for classical music (which on my model are confused, by the way:  you press Beethoven, you get Mozart, etc.) each play two pieces, so there is a good deal of variety, and of course there is the jungle sounds option which is best for sleep.  The moving figures are colourful and stare down at the child, and they not only go around in circles, but when they brush up against the leaves they spin around on their own strings a bit, which keeps baby fascinated.  I was worried at first that they were moving too slowly, but the speed seems to be just perfect for the baby.  The only criticism is that, as many reviewers have pointed out, the light isn't very bright, but we didn't buy it for the light so this isn't a big deal.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|I own and have seen this movie probably four or five times now.  It is what turned me on to the fabulous actress Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Of course James Spader plays his usual villainous role. It's definitely not your run of the mill love story but well worth the watch.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|\\"A man can be reached if he has God in his heart\\",priest.\\"I don't think God is very interested in me Father,\\" Jack. \\"You are an American...you are very good with your hands\\".Silent assassin,hit man,gun maker.Clooney in serious,moody mode.He has come to Italy on the orders of his employer,due to a botched assassination attempt against him by `the Swedes' in Sweden,where he holidayed with his girlfriend,whom he despatches after she finds out he uses a gun.You sense that the character Clooney plays in this,the isolated loner who trusts no one,is the black-back of the sunny mirror persona,all smiles and smooth talk of his usual on-screen persona.Clooney's roles have been getting progressively darker,Syriana,Solaris,Michael Clayton.Harking back to the thrillers of the 70s with Marvin,Newman,McQueen,Sinatra et al and with a nod to the Euro-thriller genre of Ronin.This role plays on a single note of sadness and gloom,which only the top of today's actors can summon up to carry a film.There is no deepness in these still waters.We don't get to know anything about the character or his back history nor what he is thinking.He has relationships with a prostitute who gives the film the warmth that the anti-hero lacks and a village priest,who knows he is not what he seems.Clooney cannot convey existential angst only bored anxiety.Methodically paced and precisely directed by Corbijn with beautiful cinematography,capturing the rustic wonder of the Italian village,against Jack's rootlessness,paranoia and menace rather than thrills are the order of the day.The film falls into sentimental clichés,softening the ruthless anti-hero into a variation of his Up in the Air grey stud.
B000002JSP|5.0|I've been jamming out to Led Zeppelin since I was a tot hanging out with my dad in the early 80's.  A goal of mine has been to collect all the Led Zeppelin albums and only recently purchased this one on Amazon.  Of the seven songs, In the Evening blows the roof off and Fool In the Rain along with All My Love come in at a close second.  Hopefully, one day Jimmy and Robert will tour again so I can see them.  So far I've seen a knock off band called Get the Led Out and they do an amazing job!

I did, until I read and reread dozens of times The Elements of Style.  This little Book taught me how little I really knew about mastering the Art Of Writing.  I give it as a gift to all the young aspiring writers who come to me for counsel.  BUY THIS BOOK!  You'll be a better writer as a consequence.  And you may even remember to say \\"Thank you, King Arthur.\\"  Arthur Stanley Katz, April 10, 2011
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Another vote for the Original release... Actually I'd like to have both in one set, the Original release and the touched up version (mostly to compare).
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Not that I think his other books were wonderful--in fact, most are barely readable--but I was expecting a Page-turner with some jaw-dropping facts thrown about. Nope! Instead, it's a lame \\"National Treasure\\" type of story. Bleh!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The book is fantastic and I can't praise Tina Fey's writing enough. What is not great is that she uses little footnotes marked by asterisks and in the Kindle edition, they aren't footnotes, but endnotes. So you'll see an asterisk in the text, but then no note until you get to the end at which point there are about 20 footnotes and you have to remember what they referred to. This definitely takes something away from the experience. I hope the publisher fixes this soon.

B000002KIE|5.0|Bollocks is the best punk record ever recorded, raw music, cutting vocals, and political topics that even got the band in trouble in the UK. I first got this on cassette when I was about 12 and listened to it nonstop. Nothing that has come out since by any band has had the same power and effect that this had on me when I listened to it then and when I listen to it now. In the short time the Sex Pistols where together they produced a punk masterpiece that should be heard by all that think they know what punk is, after hearing this you truly will.
0307472841|2.0|This relatively interesting mystery becomes overwhelmed by Mr. Manning's need to show us how smart he is about today's China. Not only does it take over the story, but distorts it to the point of ridiculousness. He should either write mysteries or major historical books but not together. I could barely make it to the end.
B0019NG73G|5.0|Please tell me this will be in full surround sound when released to Blu-ray! The DVD was produced in 5.0, that means no subwoofer track! What? Great cannonade preceding Pickett's Charge and no subwoofer track? Great battle scenes and no \\"rumble\\"? Who's the mental midget that made that decision? As one of the reenactors involved in the filming I was disappointed in the repitition of the battle scenes, especially the Confederate charge up Little Round Top. The same scene is used over and over again. We filmed that for days and all they used was the same scene over and over. Poor editing at best, ignorance at worst. A good movie that could have been a great movie in a more competant director's hands. Can you imagine this done by a class act like Steven Speilberg? If the level of realism displayed in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" had been achieved in \\"Gettysberg\\" it would be a modern masterpiece. Instead, the DVD version is now available in the Walmart $5 bins.
B002L6NYBS|2.0|This is a very entertaining DVD.  Enjoyed it very much.  Colin Firth as usual was very good as was Rupert Everette.  Would recommend it to Colin Firth fans.
1400153786|5.0|This book shatters through that 'mental block' you may have about religion.  It puts all the religion speak into rational terms, and lets you lose those childhood fears and guilt you may have been programmed with.  This book really snaps the world into focus and brings the clarity to think about gods and religion in a way that lets you access meaningful thought about your life and what it really means to be a person.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|This was another one of Jodi Picoult's phenominal writing!  Loved this book....couldn't put it down!!!!  Made me cry....and still something I think about and reflect on days and days after putting the book down!
0786956127|5.0|I am quite satisfied with these map tiles I buy for the first time, all is just what I expected. Useful, good quality, and package is in 100% good condition, even after all those transportation from US to China.
B0036EH3WK|4.0|The good: It's LOST, and it's one of the best shows ever. And it's on blu-ray, so it's very high quality. I've only watched about 8 episodes so far and I haven't delved into any bonus features on the discs. It does come in some very neat looking packaging and includes fun extras like a map and a board game.    The bad: Each disc (at least in season one) has a bunch of dumb crap*  at the beginning that you have to hit the \\"next chapter\\" button to skip. You should be able to, but cannot use the \\"top menu\\" button. But the real problem is that there is stupid stuff at the beginning in the first place. The next issue is the packaging. Although the packaging is really cool looking, it's not convenient. It's huge and can't fit on a shelf with other DVDs/blu-rays. Each season is in a sleeve that folds out into four panels or so. The discs are in little \\"pockets.\\" My problem with this is that you have to slide the discs in and out... in my experience scratches of some kind are unavoidable no matter how careful you are with this sort of setup. I've heard that blu-ray discs don't scratch as easily as DVDs/CDs, but I'd still prefer a case of some kind that will better protect my investment. I did pay a fair penny for this set, after all.    Conclusion: This set was worth getting, since it was less than buying each season separately. So long as you're okay with the strange packaging and are careful with the discs. Maybe I'm just nitpicking, but I wish it could be even better.      *One of the annoying things at the beginning of the disc is an advertisement for this new thing called \\"blu-ray disc\\" that you might want to look into... after you get done watching the blu-ray disc that is currently in your blu-ray player. Why is this advertisement on the disc? It's stupid.
0786955716|4.0|This set of Map tiles has good quality and good package, very useful in DND games. Though I want to remind DMs, The \\"City\\" map tiles do NOT have roofs(the cover of the box is roofs actually, but IDK how to use them, cos you have to destroy the box). They are mainly in-door scenes. The whole thing is very elegant, though.
B00005RIKI|5.0|This band drew attention to Southern Rock Bands by being a group of talented and dedicated musicians.  They paved the way for others, but none could hold a candle to Lynard Skynerd.  If your a Fan as well this is a Must Have CD to have in your collection. Many of the songs on this album Topped the Charts.  Over 30years later, their music is well known by today's generation.  They may not have the same appreciation as the fans that supported the Band since the begining of their journey as Super Stars, but I see a respect from teens today.  The music on this Album is written from the Heart and life experience.  The Lead singer preforms the songs with creative emotion, this draws the listener into the moment of the story.  :)
0786955554|4.0|Very good replenish to the starter box of DND essential. Definitely good choice if you haven't any dungeon tiles. Very good quality and package, useful as I expected.
B004SQS9FA|3.0|It's not bad... but it's not great. I've listened to this album several times and it's always mildly enjoyable while it plays. Once it's over, it all just fades into an unmemorable blur. I can't think of a single song that stands out from the others. Look, if you like Radiohead, you'll get this regardless. It's not a masterpiece, but it should tide you over until their next one.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This terrific film with two wonderful actors, Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, is full of action but it also has moments that bring the characters to life.    The train, minus an engineer, is headed for disaster at 70 miles per hour when our heros devise a plan to try and bring down the speed.     This is Tony Scott, director, at his usual heart-stopping best.  Missed the usual birds and dogs in this film but they may be there--I was too wrapped up in the story to notice.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|The DVD arrived in a timely manner, with secure packaging.  I am thrilled to now own this memorable concert to be viewed in my own home.  I appreciated the fact that there was enough information listed on Amazon to assure me it was a \\"legal\\" DVD.  A few years ago I purchased from Amazon a DVD, titled Transformers.  It was a terrible attempt at \\"copying\\".  I have tried to be very careful since.
630469654X|5.0|I love a fairy tale that has all the components: good guys, bad guys, a great love story and a young Matthew Broderick.  Also there is a ruined castle and a marvelous black horse that dances rather than walks or trots.    But the hawk is spectacular as it soars above the water dipping its' talons as it flies and accompanied by beautiful background music.    Actors are all outstanding including Michelle Pfeiffer, Rutger Hauer,Leo McKern and John Wood.  But, Broderick is a real winner as the \\"mouse.\\"  He is a thief who talks to God and becomes drawn in to the tragic love story.  But like all good fairy tales, there is a happy ending.      This is a 1985, flick but if you enjoy a very sweet story with a lot of action, this is a must see!
B00005QGAX|5.0|Bad. The album that came after the great Thriller. How do you top Thriller? Bad, sadly, did not top Thriller in terms of sales, but musically, it is better than Thriller. I mean it. Let's take a look.    1. Bad. An exciting start to the album. Originally intended to be a duet between MJ and Prince, Prince decided not to go along with the project because he didn't want to sing the line \\"Your butt is mine\\" to MJ. MJ himself described the lyrics as follows,    \\"'Bad' is a song about the street. It's about this kid from a bad neighborhood who gets to go away to a private school. He comes back to the old neighborhood when he's on a break from school and the kids from the neighborhood start giving him trouble. He sings, 'I'm bad, you're bad, who's bad, who's the best?' He's saying when you're strong and good, then you're bad.\\"    Right from the start, this song grabs you and prepares you for the rest of the album. It's edgy, it's funky, it's... MJ.    2. The Way You Make Me Feel. Another explosive piece. This song really captures the youthful energy of MJ at the time, and this piece makes you feel happy and upbeat every time you listen to it. An absolute classic. 10/10    3. Speed Demon. What is this? A song about driving fast? MJ said that he wrote this piece when Quincy Jones told him to write a song about the time when he was pulled over while going to the recording studio. He sings about this topic only once, here on Speed Demon. Now, this song is really great to listen to when you're driving on the highway. Quite an unusual song. He never, and I repeat, never sings about driving ever again, but here he does. This song ... I really don't know how to describe this piece. It's unusual... Nevertheless, the beat is great, the lyrics are great, and well, the whole song is great. 8/10    4. Liberian Girl. Written in 1983 and considered for the Victory Album, it was reworked and rewritten and appeared on Bad. Quite an exotic piece, the song starts with a South African singerby the name of Letta Mbulu saying a Swahili phrase \\"Naku Penda pia, Naku Taka pia, Mpenziwe!\\" (I love you too, I want you too, my love!). One word describes this piece. SEXY. I usually compare this piece to Butterflies, because they are quiet, yet both songs ooze passion. Passion just flows right out and hits you. Sexy, smooth, it's a relaxing piece. I LOVE it. 10/10    5. Just Good Friends. A duet with Stevie Wonder, it is the first song on this album NOT written or composed by Michael. I have heard some call this duet \\"heavenly\\", and some call this a \\"filler\\". Even though I acknowledge Stevie Wonder's voice is \\"heavenly\\", I feel that this song is the only \\"filler\\" on this album. 6/10    6. Another Part Of Me. An explosive, happy piece which gives you energy. I absolutely love this piece, and I always return to this piece when I am extremely melancholy. 9/10    7. Man In The Mirror. The first MJ song to deal with global issues, this was written by Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard. An amazing piece, this song is really immortal because of it's finely crafted production, Michael's vocals, and the topic of the piece. One of Michael's best pieces ever. 10/10    8. I Just Can't Stop Loving You. Heavenly piece. Originally, the song began with Michael talking, but that was later cut. What a bad move. The spoken intro makes the song even more heavenly. Anyways, a duet between Siedah Garrett and MJ, Siedah's vocals and Michael's vocals mingle with one another to give the piece a heavenly effect, and makes you feel so relaxed and happy. The very beginning of the piece gives me the imagery of sitting on an open field with your loved one and watching the sun rise over a distant hill. And then, the romance begins...   One of my favorites. 10/10    9. Dirty Diana. An absolute contrast to the soft piece right before. A rough, edgy piece, the topic is similar to the topics covered by Billie Jean, and Who Is It. But that's where the similarity ends. Whereas Billie Jean and Who Is It are both soft, quiet, with emotion simmering under the surface, this piece just explodes and the emotion pierces the surface. 10/10    10. Smooth Criminal. A MJ classic. I'm sure everyone, and I mean EVERYONE knows the Smooth Criminal video with the anti-gravity lean! The lyrics ask frantically, \\"Annie are you OK?\\". Well, I want to know, Annie, ARE you OK? Anyways, the song is powerful, and it just explodes everywhere. Words cannot adequately describe the piece. Just buy the album and listen for yourself. The greatest way to end an album. 10/10    11. Leave Me Alone. Even though this piece didn't come with the original Bad album, I feel this is worth reviewing because of it's topic: the media. I feel that Leave Me Alone and the later Tabloid Junkie (in HIStory) do the best job of attacking the media and how they sensationalize stories. 10/10     This gives a total score of 103/110, which is 94%, which means this is a GREAT album.    * * *    While Thriller was Michael's commercial achievement, Bad is really more of a musical achievement. The songs range from sexy, to tough, to energetic, to frantic, to rough. Even though some people consider Thriller to be Michael's best album, I wholeheartedly disagree. Bad is a musical album. AMAZING.
0393316041|5.0|\\"Surely Your Joking,Mr. Feynman,\\" is a book that you keep because you read it and reread it.  I love Feynman's sense of humor and his story-telling.  He  certainly was a character who led a remarkable life with a wide variety of interests.    I bought the book from Amazon after seeing the movie, \\"Infinity.\\"  The movie describes a tragic love story but also allows the viewer an opportunity to get a glimpse of the Feynman attrobutes.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Loved this film.  Thought the acting was outstanding by the leading ladies.  Hard to believe they were \\"acting\\" since I was convinced they were really in love.    The husband \\"Barry\\" was perfect for the role of the preacher with a problem understanding that its actually possible for people to love someone of the same sex.    The son Nash wasn't as convincing playing the role of the son that discovers his mother's little secret.     Not sure why the film needed to be set as a documentary versus just letting it play out as a standard movie.    Tended to distract from the movie in my opinion.      The ending was a different.   Not sure why they needed to move forward 6 months and then try to tie up the lose ends.      I guess having the ladies walk off into the sunset would be too mundane.     The film held my attention.  Especially during the scenes involving the two lead characters.  This has to be the longest kiss ever in a film.   Bravo!   Worth the money to buy this DVD and keep it in your library of great Lesbian films.
B002VECLVO|5.0|This is the movie Colin Firth should have won an Oscar for, and the academy knows it, and why he won for his performance this Oscar year.  Tom Ford put his 'FOOT' in this movie..lovely directorial debut.
0785814531|3.0|If you order this from Amazon (as a seller), I hope you are not in a hurry.  I had a paper to write on Poe, and it showed up just after I turned in the final draft.  This was weeks after I ordered it.  I'm sure the book is great, but I don't have time to read it now.  I did have time a few weeks ago though... Again, this is only a reflection of the seller of this book, not on the book itself.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Michael Connelly has not lost his touch for eloquent writing.  Mickey Haller, known as a defense attorney, has been affected by the dip in the economy.  So he is working on foreclosures and has even had to pick up an associate.  Everything changes when one of his foreclosure clients is picked up for murder.  Just like that, the Lincoln Lawyer is back in the spotlight on a high profile murder case.  As he puts together his case, he comes up against a take-no-prisoners prosecutor, a sleazy Hollywood hanger-on looking to make a buck from his client's case, and all the usual players - Rojas the driver, Lorna the ex-wife and office manager, Cisco the investigator, and Jennifer Aronson, the newbie.    Haller proceeds through the case with his usual zeal, even with a mounting dislike of his client.  However, when he is assaulted in a parking garage late one night, he becomes convinced that he is on the right track.    Mickey Haller provides a very different story than Harry Bosch.  Instead of a police procedural, Connelly writes a court procedural that provides a fascinating look into how a criminal trial really works.  It really is not about justice, it's about who plays the game better.  I highly recommend, to longtime fans of Connelly's work as well as readers new to Connelly.
0312600844|3.0|I want to start my review by saying that The Corrections is one of my all-time favorite books.  It ranks in my top 10 for sure.  I loved it.  I was hoping that the reviews I'd read for Freedom were just too critical and that I would totally disagree.  Unfortunately, I agree with most of the reviews on Amazon - the book was too long and just not nearly as good as The Corrections.  And of course it's impossible to not compare the two.  I don't know if I would have even picked it up had it not been Jonathan Franzen, because the premise just doesn't sound that interesting.  And, alas, it wasn't.  There were intesting moments, but I never really ended up caring about any of the characters that much - although the chapters from their own perspectives were long I never really felt the characters were developed (or maybe they just were shallow people and that was all there was to them).  I did enjoy the ending, but felt relieved when I finally finished this book - it felt like it took me a long time to get through it.
0316098337|5.0|I listened to \\"The Room\\" as an audio book and, about half way through, had to bring the rest of the disks in from the car and listen to the rest inside.  Just couldn't wait to read the rest.    Jack's 5-year-old point of view so heightened the impact of this story.  One of those books you will still be thinking about years later.  Absolutely brilliant!    I just hope they don't try to make a movie out of this; first person POV is almost impossible to make work in a film (Think Lovely Bones, which was a brilliant book and an horrendous film).    As a writer myself, I'm awed by what this author has managed to create!
B002QYNIHU|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST DBZ FIGURE MADE IN MY OPINION..SON GOKU IS GREAT..AND HE COMES WITH KAMAHAMAHA HANDS AND DIFFERENT FACE..I RECOMMEND TO ALL DBZ FANS
0060989157|5.0|This is far and away the greatest \\"autobiography\\" I have ever read (even though it was my first)!  It was not only extremely interesting, emotional, and, in some ways, inspirational, but it was very well written and had a great flow to it.  Having each band member, as well as those who were entrenched in their lives at the time, write their own chapters was the perfect way to tell their story.    My only regret is that it had to come to an end.  I wish all 80's hair bands/rock groups would tell their stories in this manner.  Before this book all I read was fiction (James Patterson, John Grisham, Stuart Woods, Tess Gerittsen, etc.) but this book has opened up a whole new genre for me in musical autobiographies.  I can't wait to read more.  I only hope I didn't reach the peak of them with this one.
B002N8A14M|5.0|Great product.  It is very difficult to find a case for the \\"older\\" generation nano.  Thrilled to have found something.
B004CURZFC|1.0|We start with about 3 minutes of nice family time, then we are thrust into evil resembling the horrors of World War II with the Pure Ones having kidnapped and brainwashed young owls.  Many battles follow and there is even a traitor.  This movie is not even redeemed with the fact that good conquers evil.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  Not sure how this made it to movie theaters!
B00005JKMQ|4.0|I've purchased this movie for a gift and I tested it before.  Everything was fine with it.  besides that, is not one of my favorites to be honest :)
0316077054|5.0|Very good book.  I boughed it for my friend because she couldn't find it anywhere.  She already finished.  She say the book is awesome.  Very romantic.
0756404738|4.0|First of all I'm rating this book against all the other books on the market besides it's predecessor Name of The Wind (NOTW).      Why am I doing that you may ask...  It is a good book.  Nay, a pretty good book.  Not a VERY good book.  Not a FANTASTIC Book.  It was not NOTW which when it came to rating I COULDN'T GIVE ENOUGH STARS.  This book is real.  It's gritty.  It's got a few parts I didn't like.  It's got a few parts I really liked.  But mostly, it's a reality check.  It said to me:  Patrick Rothfuss is HUMAN.    Yup, the Author of the best book I have ever read is human.  What else did it tell me?  He is setting up for a fantastic ending to his saga.  Sure this book was GOOD, and does NOT compare to NOTW. But it is worth buying, worthy of reading, and most importantly worthy of some respect.
B004L79VUI|5.0|What a great record from one of the greatest song writers of our time.  5 stars all the way!
B000HT3Q3M|3.0|The price was right, although there was a person's name taped to the cd cover and a huge chunk of the insert was crudely cut out, leaving missing information.  That was not in a description that I could find.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|I bought this item after i heard the song Dear God 2.0. And i was very happy with it. They are like a mix of rap, hip hop and r&b. Its one of my favorite cds and they are great. I will buy more of their music.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Like other reviewers I really liked the first book, \\"The Name of the Wind\\".  I thought that this second in the series would further develope the characters and also contain enough story to stand on its own merit.  I was disappointed in the lack of story and was left wondering about two of the major characters.  For my modest opinion, I feel Mr. Rothfuss's writing is really good but there is too much redundancy.  I believe that I could have skipped this book and just waited for \\"day three\\".
0307593495|5.0|I closed the last page of this book....desperate to find more lines to read...urgently looking to see if Linda becomes the new \\"Wallander\\"...hunting for this lovable, curmudgeon that had captured my heart to continue ...somewhere.     I can't stand that this series is over...I feel like I lost a beloved uncle...the idea that his life ends in a chilling loss of identity fills me with a cold creeping sadness. I loved this series...start from the beginning and relish it....this kind of writing doesn't come along often.
B0021L8V1Q|1.0|One of the worst movies i ever watched. If you liked BAND OF THE HAND you may like this junk.
0451228375|4.0|First of all, the type is too small. I'd been scoffing at those strangely-shaped too-tall paperbacks that allow bigger type for boomer's aging eyes. This is the first time I wish a publisher had used it. At age 65, this is the very first time I've encountered a paperback that I found difficult to read due to type size. I certainly wish that they'd foregone the sample teaser chapter at the end and had used the extra space to make the type just a big more legible. If I were going to read it again, I'd get the hardbound from the library instead of trying to read the paperback.    Now the review.    This is a thoroughly enjoyable page-turner, and it certainly brought the Middle Ages alive for me. By all means, read it, especially if you know you like Ken Follett. I loved it. But, like the medieval image of the spinning Wheel of Fortune, the plot spins all too mechanically, rather like a soap opera in print. The book is populated with a handful of human characters that you really do care about, and a comic-book background of sociopathic villains who exist, seemingly for no other purpose than to make the main characters' lives miserable.    The book feels almost like a linked series of short stories or novellas. Every episode contains some little detail that seems important, but you are not quite sure why. The main characters surmount a terrible obstacle, and just as you think everything is going to be OK, you realize that the strangely salient detail was a fuse that was lit in order for a bomb to explode into the next crisis.  Lather, rinse, repeat. Worst of all, the evil villains in many cases act against their own self-interest, as if their success is less important to them than spoiling things for the Good Guys.    Follett takes particular care to recapitulate past bits of the plot as needed and re-identify characters as they reappear. This is a much-appreciated courtesy to the relaxed reader who is simply reading for pleasure. I never had trouble remembering characters or disentangling intertwined plot threads. Although it's a long book, you don't have to read it all in one piece. You can put it down for a day or two, pick it up, and not get lost--Follett steers you right back.    The central characters have too much of a 21st-century sensibility to feel right. I just don't know. On the whole I think it is more likely that human nature is what it is, and it is closer to the truth to make the interior life of a 1300's prioress the same as that of a modern woman than than to believe it was utterly alien. Still, it is a little strange to see people of that era taking such modern attitudes toward gender roles, sexual orientation, evidence-based medicine, free-market economics... No, Caris (the nurse/heroine) doesn't actually start wondering if fleas cause plague, or discovering that that green mold is great for healing wounds--it's not _that_ bad. But, I dunno, I just think he goes a little too far.
B00005CDNI|5.0|Voulez-Vous is quite simply the best of the best! Abba is the best pop band, and this album represents many of their greatest songs. If you like your music catchy, fun and high energy, this is for you.
B004IFYMWK|4.0|\\"Fair Game\\" (2010) chronicles the Valerie Plame/Joseph Wilson saga at lightning speed - fueled by career-high performances from Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. Surpassing his previous directorial efforts, Doug Liman handles the real-life Washington intrigue with a sure hand. Apart from a disappointingly abrupt conclusion, this unjustly ignored political thriller packs a tremendous wallop.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|This is a great DVD/CD set!  David Foster is a genius when it comes to music.  A must see!
0765350386|4.0|For its first hundred and fifty pages or so, _Mistborn_ is a decent story not particularly well told.  I might go so far--might--as to call it poorly written.  It's front-loaded with its own errors.  Everything bad about the book shows up in the beginning.  You've got a fairly standard fantasy plot, Rebels vs. Dark Lord.  One protagonist is an abused street urchin who turns out to have amazing powers.  The other is the rebel leader, who has the same powers and views himself as the Man Who Will Save the World.  It seems as though Kelsier smiles five times a page or every time he speaks, whichever is more.  Vin is all right, but makes the leap from uneducated street thief to powerful Allomancer and revolutionary very, very quickly.  All the characters speak quietly, stand quietly, wait quietly, watch quietly, eat quietly, and ask questions in quiet voices.  A search-and-delete on variants of 'quiet' would've been a major improvement and maybe cut twenty pages off the finished novel.  The magical system is creative and unique from the outset, but if you wonder at the start whether you're crazy for not enjoying this popular book... you're not.  If you wonder whether you're missing what makes it so great, you aren't, yet.  The good stuff shows up after Part One is done, when Vin's part in the plan starts to take off and Kelsier has a lot more to do than smile.  Intrigue, magic, and action take over.  At first the rebellion feels like a bunch of twelve-year-old boys brainstormed it in their treehouse, but starting with Part Two it becomes something real.  Characterization deepens;  dialogue sounds more natural.  Sanderson does a neat thing with his characters.  They question each other's motives and competence, and in spots it's clear they're misunderstanding or misjudging each other--or themselves; that's the interesting bit, you get the feeling the truth always lies somewhere between the internal perspective and the external.  Sanderson uses his multiple viewpoints to good effect.  You've got room to decide for yourself whether Kelsier is as good a man as he thinks he is, or Vin is as cautious and careful as she believes.  By the time the endgame begins the story is no longer being carried by Allomancy. Allomancy is still the book's greatest strength, but I cared what happened to Vin, Elend, the rebels, and the Empire, all of which had come into their own.  _Mistborn_ is a book to pick up for the sake of a magical system you haven't seen a billion times before, and a book to stick with because its world and people will eventually make it worthwhile.  They never do stop doing stuff quietly, though.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|Sucker Punch was NOT AT ALL what I expected, and the story line just wasn't there.  Sorry, but it was WEIRD.<br />The CGI was FANTASTIC, a definite 5 plus.  The music was pretty hip.  It was kickin' at another 5, assuming you like heavy-beat rock with some rap.  It made me feel like dancing myself!  The story was a ZERO -- nada, zilch, zippo.  Don't get me wrong though, I could easily watch it again for the CGI.<br /><br />The movie begins with a young girl (age 18 or so?) and her sister (age 8?).  Their mother dies and they are left all the inheritance while their step-father gets nothing.  Boy, is he mad!  He comes after the oldest girl, obviously attempting to do her harm.  She escapes and comes back with a gun, too late to save her now dead sister.  With the blood on her hands from caressing her sister, she shoots the gun but does not kill daddy.  Daddy calls the authorities and says the girl did it.  Next thing you know, the girl is in the Lennox House for the criminally insane in Vermont.  (This all happens in the very beginning.) Daddy does some wheeling and dealing with an orderly there to make sure the girl never gets to talk about it, but the girl decides she is going to get out and enlists the help of others she is in there with.  (From here, most of us would probably expect certain things to happen and have already formulated the expected ending in our minds.--Guess what?  Nope!) From here, she goes off into several scenarios of fantasy fighting her inner demons with the help of her friends.  The scenarios are different and jump all around.<br /><br />I don't want to tell you anymore about the plot.  I will admit that I stayed with the movie the whole time and was very interested, but I am fascinated by great CGI, so the CGI with the thumpin' heavy-beat music was enough for me.<br /><br />In generalizing, I would say this is a movie mostly for the younger folks (age 18 - 38 or so, and 38 may be on the high side).  Most people 40 or over would probably give it a negative rating.  If you are on the fence about it, I suggest you rent it for a buck from the big red box before you buy it.f you are on the fence about it, I suggest you rent it for a buck from the big red box before you buy it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I really enjoyed this workout.. I was completely out of shape(zero exercise)when I started..The first week was BRUTAL.. I didn't change my diet, because weight wasn't my issue. I started seeing results within the first week! warning-the first week is brutal!  I would NOT recommend this for ANYONE with ANY joint problems.. I have pins in my ankle so I have to do the beginner version of a lot of the exercises.. There is a lot of jumping(especially in level 3)..
0316056863|5.0|I also read this in just under 24 hours--only sacrifice was that the dog didn't get as long a walk as usual. It's really funny, and, like her Palin-Clinton sketch on SNL, you're not really paying attention to the fact that you're being educated about feminism while reading it.     I also read it on the Kindle--big mistake. The graphics don't show up well. However, hearing the male Kindle voice read the cruise ship chapter was quite entertaining in its own right.    It's probably a niche audience that she appeals to, but she's nailed that voice perfectly. I'm a woman the same age as she is who has also gone to college and not had any plastic surgery. If you're in that bracket, you'll probably like it, too. I hope, however, that if you're not, you can find the wit contained in the book, just so that you can also be educated on the issues of well-read, photoshop-required women in America.
B003RNXIBK|1.0|A lot of people gave this album 5 stars, but I am not one of them. I have listened to this album a couple of times, and very song's stick out. I feel the Rock n Rap beats are annoying at best. Eminems last great cd was Marshal Mathers LP, his last good album was the Eminem show. Encore to me was ok but everything after that was crap. This CD was to generic for me to give an in depth review. Maybe \\"I just don't understand rap/hip hop\\" In either case for those that just \\"don't understand\\" but enjoyed eminems earlier records this is prolly not for you
B002ZG9846|5.0|I saw this movie before in theather but, I had to get on DVD because it was well done. The special features itself are amazing. Really informative and inspiring. A great buy.
1439102724|1.0|book was more like a lesson plan in sociology than a fiction novel.  ugh.  the characters had the potential to be emotionally engaging but picoult chose to lecture instead.  what a pity.  had she used her creative abilities to develop the characters, the story would have enfolded and reached the same conclusions she was aiming for in a much more involved and entertaining manner.  i'm a huge jodi picoult fan and anxiously awaited this book as all others by her.  was looking forward to her style of story and character development in a controversial yet touching issue involving gay couples and children.  what i got instead read and felt like a tutorial on gay issues.  very dry and academic. as if she wrote the story as an afterthought to an agenda.
B004BLTNM0|2.0|I ordered this movie with great anticipation of seeing some good old fashioned 70,s gore. BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED. This movie shows very little in the way of graphic scenes (most of it you have to imagine) and falls way short in the story department as well. Its only claim to fame, the rape scene, was ordinary at best. Save your money.
0761158820|4.0|I love that Castleforte and others have created this book for there are but a few papertoy books out there. The idea of having each toy pre-printed was awesome (especially b/c of the toll printing papertoys can have on my printer ink). The creativity of these artists always amazes me and there are vast amounts (50) and kinds of toys for everyone (ie: don't let the name \\"monsters\\" scare away young girls - there is something in here for you too).<br /><br />However, there are a few problems I had with the layout. Although the toys are pre-perforated, it is quite difficult just to punch them out - I had to use an x-acto knife (not an option for kids). I don't think kid-friendly scissors could be as exact as necessary in order to cut out some parts of the toys either, so any cutting would have to be done with parental supervision.<br /><br />Also, the toys are printed on thinner paper (thinner than an average piece of cardstock). My craft glue tended to make the paper disintegrate, so I would suggest using double-sided tape or glue dots for construction. I also agree with another reviewer that this is not a book for younger kids - the toys are just too difficult for children to handle. I would suggest an age range of at least 10 years old (probably more like 12 and older). Also, remember that there is no CD-ROM included in this book, so any mistakes are permanent (no re-printing). Since the toys are double-sided, it is quite difficult to make practice copy, too.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|If you even just barely like Les Mis you HAVE to buy this DVD!  It is just a concert but you get the full flavor of the legendary show.  Everything about this production is first class with the exception of  the inclusion of one of the Jonas Brothers and even he is pretty good!  (At least they did not cast Justin Bieber)  Alfie Boe is the best Jean Val Jean ever and that is quite a feat in a role that has been previously filled by such superb singers.  All the rest of the cast is riveting as well.  You will be amazed at the staging and the lighting as well as the two choruses and the orchestra.  On this DVD there is a heart throbbing surprise bonus at the end that is sure to give you goose bumps.  My family has watched this production at least 5 times since we purchased it about a month ago and every time it is an absolute thrill.
B004J713JW|5.0|I have to take this moment to brag that I saw Billy Joel in the Moore Theatre in Seattle in the fall of 1974.  There were less than 30 people in the audience.    Billy Joel is a national treasure.  This lovingly crafted Blu-Ray works on so many levels its hard to know where to begin.  First, the Blu-Ray is rendered with perfect color balance; I don't recall a single shot that isn't a visual delight.  Most significantly, I did not detect any video compression at all.  I would like to thank everyone involved in this decision for resisting the urge to cram too much on the disk and instead opting for the highest possible video quality.  Nearly all Blu-Ray movies are compressed such that there is obvious \\"mosquito noise\\".  I didn't detect any on this disk.    The sound is also engineered very well.  All instruments are in the proper perspective, including the numerous strings and horns.  Whoever did the engineering and mixdown should get a raise.  The rear channels of the 5.1 mix bring in mostly the ambience, including the audience, and adds to the excitement.  The rear channels are never obtrusive and allow the front and center speakers to focus on the music.  This recording is a technological marvel of the highest caliber.    I cannot say enough about the quality of the performance.  While Billy Joel is more than capable of carrying any show, these performances were really about his body of work.  The songs are featured with sufficient instrumentation and quality of musicianship to bring the studio renditions to life.  His personal performance sparkles without being over stated....he lets his songs do the talking.    I understand that there are numerous songs that didn't make it onto this disk.  Again, I presume that the producer elected to leave off some material to avoid having to apply video compression, and I absolutely agree with this decision.  I suppose I'll have to pony up some more money when the \\"complete\\" set comes out.  No worries, I'm a sucker who will buythis performance all over again if necessary.  After all, I've watched it once and already feel like I've got more than my money's worth.

0670022411|1.0|I just have to say that I really hate this book.  It's so boring and so full of itself.  And, I am mad at Danielle Trussoni for recommending it.  Let me be clear.  I do not need to know about the academic life at Oxford University or learn about its most prestigious colleges.  I do not need to follow a boring woman on her exercise routine.  I do not need to know what vampires eat as commonly I have assumed that they don't.  I do not need to know about a cool greasy spoon for locals that smug self-congratulatory academics go to to pretend that they don't care if they are seen out and about.  I. Don't. Care.  And I am sorry that this was the very first book I put on my kindle.  I literally growl every time I see the title.  If you want a cool book that starts odd and then actually grips, opt for Martin Millar's Lonely Werewolf Girl.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is no doubt an easy and addictive game to play (and quite likely has been talked about by everyone you know), but having played the first 80 levels or so, it also struck me as a little repetitive.    The main goal is to destroy the green pigs with the limited number of birds shot out of a sling-shot. This is done by pulling your finger over the bird / sling-shot on the screen and aiming with the right amount of power towards the target.     There are different types of birds (explosive bird, egg bomber bird etc.) which once you press a second time after releasing them, they will show their special attack. The structures that the pigs are hiding inside in are made out of different material (such as wood, glass, stone ...) which all need a different amount of power to break and get into.    Fun, easy and quick to play!   (& easy to learn by all ages)
0517122707|5.0|I read alot.  This book is quite good.  [End of Review]<br /><br />P.S.  While I'm not the kind of guy who laughs out loud on a plane flight to Chicago (we all know that guy), this book made me do that, twice.  This is one of those books that you really look forward to picking up and reading.  It is quite easy to visualize the scenes as you are reading them.<br /><br />P.P.S.  I bear some trepidation at the upcoming movie.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|The game design is the same as the original, but instead of shooting your birds at mean little pigs you are trying to rescue the birds from their cages and trying to aim at monkeys in the jungle (mainly designed as a sponsored version of the \\"Rio\\" movie).
1597801585|4.0|The Windup Girl is a character seen briefly in a short story in the collection 'Pump Six and Other Stories' which has more than one story set in the same milieu - a sort of post apocalyptic world in which after the end of oil and a complete change in patterns of energy consumption bioenginerring has replaced heavy engineering as the technology for creating wealth and where engineered viruses devestate our natural staple crops.<br /><br />The reader learns the background more by inference than exposition as the stories aren't about the history of the world they happen in but only the characters that live in it and their tribulations we'll never (hopefully) face.<br /><br />My favourites collection of short stories in J.G Ballards Vermillion Sands for the tastes it evokes and I enjoy Paolo Bacigalupis work for similar reasons. His writing is superb and he draws you into a totally credible world filled by fascinating characters.<br /><br />Paolo is one (with Ted Chiang and Ian McDonald) of my three favourite short story writers today. If you like Chiang or McDonalds work I assure you you'll like Bacigalupi.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Ever wanted to slice fruits like a real ninja?     I have to say that I never thought of it before and it's really creative. I also really like the simplicity of games like these especially on a mobile device.     It's fun to compete on a simple one-to-one action without complicated controls and hours of training to master. Anyone you meet on the street could give it a go and be pretty good at it on first go (which really makes it worthwile game to have in your collection)     Also a good time filler since a short game might only take a couple of minutes(depending on your skill level) ;-)
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Most of the criticism about this sharpener seems to be from people not reading the instructions and misusing the carbide notch.  The carbide portion is for really, really beat up blades.  Use it to take a lot of metal off if the blade is severely notched/chipped or completely dull.  If you have a good edge, it will destroy it.  I haven't needed the carbide yet.  The ceramic sharpener works for getting a somewhat dull blade up to barely shaving sharp. Just do what the manual says and make sure you use even pressure.  It doesn't work nearly as well as fixed sharpening rods or a belt sander, but for something to stick in a pack and have when you're out and about... it's not bad for the price.  I felt that the rod was the best feature, I've used it to touch-up the serrations on a few of my knives and it's worked fine.

B0017V7GLC|5.0|From my first hearing of 'Playgirl' all those years back, I had a feeling I was listening to the genesis of something truly special.    With Velocifero, Ladytron have truly fulfiled that promise and present this masterpiece.  '604' had moments of interest and fascination, but there was alot of experimentation with a sound of a group finding its feet musically.  'Light and Magic' evolved and developed and gained momentum on further listens same also 'Witching Hour' but both fell short of being truly brilliant.  This album presents Ladytron's finest work to date, with much stronger and more vibrant songs that previous.  Velocifero is a well rounded, accessible and thoroughly consistent album with each track, worthy of a best of.  Ladytron are the absolute bastions of latter day electronica, but ultimately great pop-rock. Needless to say worthy of greater recognition.     A must have.
B000641Z90|5.0|Sorry things are not going well for Phil right now but he has a great number of great songs and performs them beautifully on this concert dvd
B001H9MWW2|5.0|Coldplay certainly hit their stride with this their fourth album. The songs sound more confident and more purposeful than before, stamping and punching the air like they mean it. Once again the finest songs are not the singles. 'Lost' and 'Yes'  resonate and etch a indelible mark on the long term memory banks.    The addition of the Prospekts March EP is a further embelishment of the quality of the album sessions, with songs like 'Glasses of Water' and 'Life in Technicolor II' sounding as essential as those on the full album.  However I remain unsure as to the completeness of the works, and a little perturbed that I have to listen to what are in effect slight variations to the same theme.      However the disjointed arrangement does not diminish what's accomplished - 5 stars from me.  =)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Can't say enough good things, My favorite is the plans. I'm currently going through a new testament plan in I think 40 days and \\"The prayers of Jesus\\" in 5 days. You can also do post notes and you and you're friends can share, pretty awesome.
B003Y5H4SO|2.0|By he I mean M. Night Shymalan who started out great with films like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & Signs, but fell off the map with The Village, The Happening, The Last Airbender. With \\"Devil\\" he writes, produces but does not direct so this puts it a slight cut above his recent films. The premise is simple 5 people end up trapped in an elevator in a skyscraper in downtown Philadelphia and the devil is among them, but who? Unfortunately the mystery is the best part of the film however the tension isn't very high, mainly cause its kinda easy to figure it out (at least in my opinion it is.) Each of these 5 have their own flaws and good points, but only a key few are detailed. The bits and pieces of the story do tie together in the most obvious formulaic way possible, again much like his recent films.<br /><br />There's a little tension, lots of over-acting and some decent violence, thankfully not much padding given the short run time (75-78 mintues). At least its over quickly. ** out of 4 stars.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I dove into the second book in George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series with reckless abandon. After having devoured A Game of Thrones like a greedy little pig, I couldn't wait to read A Clash of Kings to find out how my favorite characters fared as the series continued.    Needless to say, the first chapter of A Clash of Kings got off to a slow start, introducing us to a new character who didn't have as much to do with the rest of the book as I'd hoped. I found myself reading through that chapter quickly in hopes of rejoining survivors from book one, and though that first chapter felt as though it dragged just a bit, I wasn't disappointed as I continued on. Soon I was reunited with Tyrion Lannister, the Stark children and their mother Catelyn each scattered across the miles of Westeros and Daenerys Targaryen.    Just as the title suggests, this second book focused heavily on the many kings battling one another for dominance, but never do we directly see the world from the direct perspective of the actual kings. We come to King Joffrey through Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister. Northern King Robb Stark is seen through his mother Catelyn's eyes. Davos the Onion Knight views the rise of Stannis Baratheon. While it may seem as though this secondhand view takes you away from some of the greatest action of the book, it actually gives you a firsthand, behind-the-scenes experience through those who deal directly the royal realms.    I began the series suspicious and wary of Tyrion Lannister, but by the end of A Game of Thrones he had quickly become one of my favorite characters. Martin continued to develop Tyrion in such a way that despite his seedy antics and twisted mind, he is perhaps one of the most sympathetic characters in the series thus far. He also gave us a greater peek at Jaime Lannister, The Kingslayer, through the eyes of Catelyn Stark, that was well worth the wait.    Theon Greyjoy's part in A Clash of Kings was unexpected, but well-metered, skillfully portraying the folly of youth tempered with uncertain ambition.    I think one of my favorite parts of the book was how many unlikely heroes arose from the darkness. Men you expected to be tainted to the bone with nothing but horror and wickedness turned out to be incredibly human, making that part of me that wanted to hate them until the bloody end soften with sympathy. I have also loved watching both Arya and Sansa Stark continue to find their strengths despite the hideous odds they're both up against.    I enjoyed A Clash of Kings a great deal, but I have to admit that after the powerful impact of A Game of Thrones had on me as a first time reader, the sequel left me wanting. I hoped for more development in areas that just didn't develop and I can only pray the third book fills those aching gaps.    Overall, I give the book 4 out of 5 stars, and highly recommend it to medieval fantasy lovers. A Song of Ice and Fire has been one of the best fantasy series I've read in years. Martin's grasp on courtly politics, as well as the steady, continuous build of his mythology has me anxious to get started on the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords.
B000053VAF|5.0|Good sarcastic humor, and a really entertaining movie I have seen several times, and enjoyed each viewing! I bought this move to share with a couple of friends who somehow have not seen this yet.

B004EPYZU8|3.0|After her mother and sister die, our protagonist known only as `Babydoll' (played by Emily Browning) is put in a mental asylum by her evil stepfather and is due to receive a lobotomy in 5 days. So she has 5 days to escape the asylum. Whilst inside she makes 4 friends - Amber (played by Jamie Chung), Blondie (played by Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (played by Jena Malone) and Sweet Pea (played by Abbie Cornish) - and with these 4 other girls concocts a plan to escape the asylum: they have to get hold of 5 objects - a map, fire, a knife, a key and a fifth, unrevealed item requiring great sacrifice - which will grant them their freedom. The plan to obtain these objects revolves around Babydoll doing a special erotic dance for Blue Jones (the director of the asylum, played by Oscar Isaac), distracting him whilst the other 4 girls retrieve the objects. We find that each time Babydoll does her erotic dances (which she presumably hates) she escapes into her imagination and we are transported to spectacular fantasy worlds where Babydoll and her 4 friends - guided by the mentor known only as The Wise Man - battle fearsome foes including fire-breathing dragons, demon samurai, advanced cyborgs and steampunk Nazis in World War II; questing in these fantasy worlds to retrieve the items they need to escape from the asylum in real life. And it is the fantasy parts of the film, with its superior CGI and kicking soundtrack that really make the film: these parts of the film where Babydoll escapes into a fantasy world in her own imagination are insane and brilliantly done with wonderful fighting moves from our 5 kick-ass babes and brilliant CGI and prevent this from being a boring movie. But will the girls' plan to escape the asylum succeed? You'll have to see the movie. Is the movie any good? I immensely enjoyed the fantasy sequences but the movie just didn't feel strung together as a coherent whole. Without the fantasy sequences the film falls apart and because it doesn't feel like a whole just isn't interesting enough. Blue Jones' character (the man who runs the asylum) is a nasty piece of work and because of him certain people die who shouldn't. We never see the supposedly amazing erotic dances that Babydoll does, presumably so that this film could get its 12 rating, seeming to imply that the subtext of this film was about the exploitation of women and the fight for freedom from exploitation. I'm not sure why the girls have the nicknames that they do, except perhaps to make the movie seem cool. And the fantasy sequences are cool but by the end of the film I felt as if I had eaten a meal that hadn't managed to satisfy my hunger. And the way events eventually play out in this movie is a cop out: what exactly was Zack Snyder (the film's director) trying to say? And why doesn't the main protagonist Babydoll talk for the first 10 or so minutes of the film? At first I thought she was mute! In the final analysis this film will be remembered for its fantasy sequences (clips from which make up the trailer). But these are not enough to make the film a coherent whole. Ultimately disappointing.le just isn't interesting enough. Blue Jones' character (the man who runs the asylum) is a nasty piece of work and because of him certain people die who shouldn't.

0316056863|3.0|Tina Fey's  Bossypants is a haphazard collection of funny anecdotes that all fans--but especially women--will enjoy.  Fey begins the book with stories of her childhood in Pennsylvania and her journey to her career through Chicago and New York City. The book is a little under three hundred pages, and may leave a reader hungry for more. The stories are entertaining and they are each hysterical, but it feels like Fey wrote the jokes first and then tried to flesh out a story around them. The chapters are short and sometimes hard to follow. Topics change from Oprah to parenting with no warning, and while the information leaves the reader satiated I almost felt like I was missing out on the \\"real\\" book.  Bossypants felt more like a teaser for her full-fledged memoirs. She didn't give much away, leaving most personal matters out of the book, and while I respect her desire for privacy it seems out of place in a book written exclusively about oneself. Tina can write some great television, but might benefit from taking a closer glance at her next book before it leaves the cutting room floor.
B001B1876G|1.0|I've never done a review on Amazon before but after seeing this movie I felt compelled to. I bought this DVD for my son, as he is into Iron Man in a crazy way. First of all, this movie is deadly dull. Incredibly boring. It is also full of \\"funny\\" racist jokes, such as a Chinese man working with Rhody being unable to say his name correctly. Tony is portrayed as a pathetic, petulant whiner. There is literally nothing in this movie that you would want to expose to a kid- or yourself. I am both a cheapskate and a nerd but I still threw this thing in the garbage bin. If you need some Iron Man in your life, skip this junk and buy the live action movies or Armored Adventures instead.
1439148953|4.0|Colm Toibin's marvelouslly written \\"Brooklyn\\" is a small work that grapples with small lives. Through beautiful, evocative prose the author gives them a rich, recognizable dignity.  Ellis Lacey is most distinctive for her ordinariness.  Her life in Ireland consists mainly of the occasional night out with girlfriends to a dance, where she is barely even a presence.  Sunday work at the grocer's  and letters to brothers who have crossed the Irish Sea to England for work are highlights in the week.  When her chance to go to America comes, it is an unwelcome one.  Ellis would, if she had her druthers, wear her drab life like a comfortable cardigan.<br /><br />In this she is like Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles.  Not someone who seeks adventure, but whom life \\"happens to,\\" and not always for the best.  The arrival in NY's Brooklyn, mid twentieth century is hardly much of an improvement except for her meeting a potential husband.  It's a meeting that leaves her surprisingly ambivalent as marrying an American would keep her permanently on this side of the Atlantic, apart and separate forever.<br /><br />How her decision unfolds and how her conclusion is reached is quite wonderful, belying the notion that we are in charge of our destiny.  At best we are guiding a battered ship into the safest port.  Ellis Lacey's life, not so very different from most is dignified by an author who believes each of us should have at least a chance at happiness.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|So Beautiful So What is Paul Simon's 12th solo album and his first release in 5 years. And it was well worth the wait! This is, in my opinion, his best album since Graceland. As you would expect with any of his work, his melodies are amazing, his lyrics poetic, and the feel and sound stand out in its uniqueness.  \\"Rewrite\\" creates some incredible textures through the use of a West African stringed kora, a djembe drum, and even the faint grunt of wildebeests on certain guitar notes. \\"Dazzling Blue\\" has a folksy feel with some amazing fingerpicking on the acoustic guitar. \\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day\\"  uses parts of a 1941 sermon by Reverend J.M. Gates and adds richness to the story. \\"The Afterlife\\" shows Simon's lyrical genius as it explores the process of entering heaven: filling out forms and waiting in line. There really isn't any filler as each song is a joy that takes the listener on a musical journey. This is an amazing album and if you're a fan of Paul Simon you'll love it!
055358894X|1.0|This was highly recommended and ended up being the worst fantasy book I've ever read.    What it lacks in sympathetic or believable characters, it makes up for with plot holes and deus ex machina.  Don't worry, the hero never dies (it's the first book in a series, see), but not because he's smart and resourceful -- it's because the author repeatedly saves him from death with the stroke of a pen.    There's very little original thought here, just a mash up of ideas the author found in other books or video games or movies and thought would be cool:    * Gang of child thieves (ahem, Oliver Twist)  * Identical twins who finish each others' sentences (a la Samneric from Lord of the Flies, Fred & George from Harry Potter...)  * The mafia  * It's set in Venice (or the equivalent)  * An intelligence chief called the Spider (like Varys the Spider in George RR Martin)  * Characters killed for no reason (this does not make you George RR Martin)  * Random swearing (and I mean random -- when most people swear it's related to what they're saying or thinking of - has the author ever heard a real person swear?)  * All-powerful magicians who have power over you by writing your secret, true name that you tell to no one, like Ged in Earthsea.  Just kidding - they have power over you by writing your given name that you tell to everyone.  Middle names don't count.  Not sure about the rules on nicknames; guess it has to be the name on your long form birth certificate.  * Magical sea creatures that make a surprise appearance (no forshadowing, just written in for fun) and are easily defeated by your friends who happen to show up at just that moment  * All crooks -- all characters -- are super smart, or super dumb, or both, but always cardboard    Luckily this is all tied together nicely by prose somewhere between mediocre and lackluster.

B004GHNHVW|5.0|When Christmas came last year (2010), we saw the tradition of hearing old and newly released holiday music by several musicians of classic and modern music. Although Paul Simon wrote songs with mentions to the holiday season (Christmas, snow, etc.) and sang a Christmas carol (\\"Silent Night/7 O'Clock News\\") in one Simon & Garfunkel album, he never really did write a full-fledged Christmas song.<br /><br />Simon released the single \\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day\\" in late November of 2010. I wrote a short review on it (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E5UCKGEK1CHD/) explaining that it was not your traditional Christmas song but its lyrics speak of being merry despite today's world issues.<br /><br />The single would be the opening track of Simon's new album So Beautiful or So What. As he pointed out in the Amazon video, he has been making albums each with a \\"rhythmic premise\\" since Graceland and his new album was a return to basics: writing songs with his guitar.<br /><br />A variety of musical concepts, old and new, are featured in this album. A couple drumless ballads \\"Love And Hard Times\\" and \\"Questions for the Angels\\" emphasize excellent work on the guitar and piano. While The Capeman album featured some interview samples, the album likely is Simon's first attempt of sampling within a few songs including \\"Getting Ready\\" and \\"Love and Blessings\\". We see a short instrumental in \\"The Amulet\\", his first since \\"Hobo's Blues\\" from his eponymous album. Some unique sounds and instruments, like the reverse train whistle, could be taking a page from his previous album Surprise. Lastly, it incorporates catchy beats and diverse instruments that in part made Rhymin' Simon, Graceland, and other albums successful.<br /><br />Don't be fooled that this is a Christmas album by the opening song. (The detail that the album's release would be in the Spring hinted at it.) However, the song follows and later songs expand into the lyrical theme of God and religion, intertwining concepts of lifetime, love, help, and hardships. The album's title track concludes it well with the message: \\"You know life is what you make of it: so beautiful or so what.\\" I'd agree with Rolling Stone's review that the album has powerful storytelling lyrics.<br /><br />But don't discount its length. The album may feel short compared to his recent albums, clocking in at 38 minutes. But most of his solo albums (not including bonus tracks) range around 35 to 45 minutes. (Simon's eponymous and Rhymin' Simon albums were 35 minutes long each.)<br /><br />Probably the only flaw from the Deluxe CD/DVD version would be the lack of additional exclusive material. The two videos on the DVD can be viewed on Paul Simon's website (at the time of this review). Also, the live audio demo of the title track would probably be better placed on the CD than the DVD. If you enjoy the videos to the point that you want them on DVD, get the Deluxe version.<br /><br />Above all, So Beautiful or So What still can't beat Rhymin' Simon and Graceland but it is right up there with them. He has written songs for over fifty years now, and this album exhibits bits and pieces from his past work. Even though he may not be a religious person, the lyrics and music in this album show it quite well. Buy and enjoy! :)dships.

I was worried, at first, that I wouldn't be able to jump back into the book because I wasn't really sure what could possibly go on in this book without Katniss and Peeta in the game anymore and just the fact that after reading The Hunger Games  I had VERY high expectations about it's sequel.<br /><br />I think this possibly might be my all-time favorite series now. But then I start thinking about all my other top favorite series and can't possibly choose.<br /><br />Catching Fire got so many reactions out of me, which a truly great book always does. I screamed and wanted to throw the book across the room so many times due to some of the events that happened. I was hit in the face so many times because I wasn't expecting the events to happen. Which I've always loved about these books because I've never been able to guess what would happen next.<br /><br />You can see that Katniss has grown a lot since being in the Hunger Games and you get to see the effect that it has had on her. Even though Katniss annoys me at times with the whole Peeta situation, I still love her as a main character.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved this book. But absolutely HATE the cliffhanger at the end. I own the first two books, but don't have the last one yet, sadly. I went to put it on hold, being very happy I was going to be going to the library the next day, but to find that ALL 32 copies of the book that the library systems in my town has, were all UNAVAILABLE. I put it on hold and I'm currently 28 on the list to get it. WHY?!

B0001Z53F6|5.0|This DVD-Audio and DVD-Video(with a 30 minute Pete Townshend interview about the remastering and remixing) is priceless.In addition to the excellent remix by the master himself you get 17 worthy outtakes,a picture gallery and a very good booklet! What else can you possibly ask for?? Oh,I almost forgot:sell your deluxe SACD because against this it doesn't stand a chance!!
B0012GMX2Y|5.0|I forgot about this band for awhile. I had Aquiring the Taste several years back and admired their creative music. I can see where Kerry Livgren got a lot of his inspiration. Kerry from Kansas is said to have been a big fan. I can see why. Kansas did have some Gentle Giant sound in the early days. As a bass player, I marvel at the work on all songs. The bass guitar on this album is some serious, downright awesome stuff. School Days is a bass player's dream song. All songs are brilliant and the title song closes this masterpiece in fine symphonic form. I highly recommend this to prog fans.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Even though this film generates anger and dismay, it is definitely a must see.  I have passed it on to friends who are sharing my anger.  I read Michael Lewis' book before seeing the film, so I knew what was coming.  I am especially angry with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and would never do business with them.  I had asked when the film was coming in to Blockbuster and was told they were not going to stock it (the Seminole, Florida store closed about two weeks later).
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I heard their song \\"If I Die Young\\" and LOVED it.  I decided to buy the whole album after that a was very happy I did.  It is wonderful!!!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a fabulous movie.  Cher can still bat out the songs and I was blown away by Christina Aquilera singing.
B004J4WQ46|3.0|Let me just say that Is This It and Room On Fire are *classic* rock albums and should be in the collection of every rock fan out there. Angles here, though, is not so fortunate. While it beats out First Impressions of Earth by a looong mile, it is simply not in the same league as those first two Strokes records. This album does have some truly awesome tracks. See: Machu Pichu, Under Cover, Taken For A Fool, Gratisfaction. Unfortunately, like FIOE, the Strokes felt the need to \\"expirement\\" with their sound again. Herein lies my problem with Angles. Just about every \\"new Strokes\\" song here sucks. You're So Right, Call Me Back, GAMES (oh, games). It's almost painful for me personally. The good stuff here is REALLY good...maybe even Room On Fire good. But the lame, 80s revival stuff here is unforgivingly awful. Maybe Someday* the Strokes will realize that they perfected their sound all the way back in 2001 with their debut. The Strokes have another stellar album in them (you can hear bits and pieces of it here). When and if we'll ever get that record, I don't know. For now, we have Angles.
1591843790|5.0|Guy's book is about how to enchant your stakeholders at all levels and in a vast spectrum of situations and environments. Replete with stories it resonated with me a many levels.<br /><br />I met Guy here in Paris where I attended his book presentation (400 plus attendees) at ESCP, a leading European business school. We had a chance to chat and exchange signed copies of our respective books.<br /><br />As a speaker and author myself, I was interested to see Guy's presentation style and how it \\"synched\\" with his book. My expectations were exceeded, both meshed perfectly. The delightful commonalities that surfaced in both are his abundant use of stories. His book, for example, starts with his own engaging Personal Story and the subsequent 12 chapters end with captivating stories of various individuals who give true-life meaning to what was introduced in the chapter. Interestingly enough, the most touching story is the last one in the book that doesn't reference any of the chapters...most likely an intentional twist...emotional tug at the end.<br /><br />Guy's style reflected in his book and presentation is self-effacing, convivial, and slightly humorous. It worked well with this ESCP audience of young aspiring entrepreneurs, international but mostly French, in the process of completing their Masters Degree in Entrepreneurship. He peppered his speech with quite a few American expressions, references, catch phrases, buzzwords and play on words that a few times were lost on this European, mostly non-native English speaking, audience. Cognizant of this, he did some \\"filler\\" explaining.<br /><br />The book is nicely laid out. Set up as a journey with 12 chapters to the itinerary, it is replete with good advice and tips to navigate the way to enchanting your stakeholders. Considering the three C's of a strong brand...Clarity, Consistency and Constancy...Guy has it nailed. One question...with such a consistent winning smile you wonder if he ever gets mad. Look forward to his next book.<br /><br />Bernadette Martin<br />Founder - Visibility Branding [...]<br />Personal Brand Strategist, Author, StorytellerFounder - Visibility Branding [...]  Personal Brand Strategist, Author, Storyteller
B004NSULHM|4.0|This may not be the most outstanding thing Radiohead have done. After In Rainbows, one might even see it as a step backwards. Regardless, this is a great album that creates its own distinct sleepy-morning atmosphere that really sets it apart from any of their previous albums. If Bloom is groggily falling out of bed at the sound of your alarm, Separator is stepping outside sipping a cup of coffee as the sun rises. In many ways, this is the most mature Radiohead album yet. Whereas on previous albums a song like Morning Mister Magpie might've seen a dramatic crescendoing catharsis, here the song spins off into an intricate slow burn groove. I suppose that's what TKOL is. A subtle, quaint, 8 track \\"lp\\" by one of the biggest bands in the world. No press, few appearances, no explanations. To call it an understatement would be an understatement in itself. What will be most interesting in the months and years to come will be the accounts of the people who had initially written off the album revisiting it and discovering the little gem they had nearly passed by.

1572816112|5.0|This is a truly amazing deck! Really interesting artwork. As soon as I saw pictures of this deck online I had to have it. I don't think it's dark at all, just really stylized and unique. The imagery is really deep and the cards are immediately easy to read.<br /><br />My readings with this deck, using the Lunatic spread provided, are spot on. The cards are a little long and hard for my tiny hands to shuffle but I don't care! This deck is just too amazing not to have and use on a regular basis. I have the Chinese printing it seems but I couldn't be happier with it. The cards feel like good stock to me. I also own a RWS and a Thoth deck and the quality of DM feels on-par.<br /><br />The artwork is so multi-dimensional that I could see it branching out into a graphic novel or something. You can really tell this deck took years to develop. I'll DEFINITELY be getting the companion book that Patrick is working on currently.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|Bought on April1,2011<br /><br />This was major hit when media war was won by blu ray over HD discs and boasted blockbuster success world wide but now slowly its becoming a mess because studio isn`t paying attention to quality assurance. This isn`t 1080P though it is usa version.May be older versions were but not anymore .I uploaded image on product page so you can take a look and wrongly advertised by many (Now fixed on amazon though) as 50 GB disc set.its 25 GB .New shipments are arriving with \\"Made in Mexico\\" stamp so BBC wants us to blame them for degrading standard and becoming cheap .On back of bluray they published review of \\"Chicago Tribune with statement . \\"This is the best DVD of the year...an absolute extraordinary achievement.\\" What wrong with studios??? Planet earth reviewed by countless media outlets with good scoring and thats what they chosen DVD Review for blu ray product.Its like you pay for plane ticket and they hand you over bus ticket.Its such a shame .Still confusing images of 5 disc and 4 disc collection are part of product detail though studio settled for 4 disc version for usa.<br />Product itself is great but standards that gave this collection huge success and falling apart.
0316056863|5.0|This is one of the best written autobiographies of this generation.  Tina Fey is so smart, funny, poignant, relevant and relatable; reading her book is like sitting down with a good girl friend over a bottle of wine talking about all the things that make you mad, laugh and do the crazy things you do.  I couldn't put her book down, and like any good thing, I didn't want it to end.  I hope she keep up her writing, not just for TV and film, but books for the rest of us dummies who still read things.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|I can't lie, I'm a dude, so I definitely don't listen to this crap. But, I bought it for my girlfriend. I've spotted her on more than one occassion singing to this CD. So, I guess that means it's good...right? The only downside I didn't foresee coming was the fact that I'd have to listen to it from time to time when I ride with her. It's OK though, I get her back when I listen to Mudvayne and the like.
B00314VYNE|3.0|My daughter really enjoyed this toy, she played with it for a good 10 minutes on her birthday , and I've seen her play with it one or two other times, perhaps 30 minutes of playtime total.    I think it cost around $20.00, so that comes out to about $40 per hour of playtime,  which makes a trip to Disneyland almost seem cheap.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|I have been following Jessie J on youtube for over a year. I loved her music and her personality. Her songs are very original and you know she is singing from her heart.I have been waiting to hear her cd since I heard it was going to be released. If you buy this cd you will not be disappointed.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I am no stranger to WolframAlpha. Being in a few classes that involve calculus, I know what this thing can do. I'm grateful that this app comes with its own keyboard as it helps alot with integrals (and does it step by step). It knows more than calc, as it knows history, important dates, stocks, and much more.
0316056863|5.0|This book is, in one word - hilarious!  I laughed out loud MANY times.  It's a fun mix of memoir and comedy.  At times, I could've used more memoir - more stories about SNL, 30 rock, her family, etc, but overall, it was an enjoyable peek into the life of Tina Fey.  It left me wanting more, which is the best way for a book to end.  Sequel coming soon?  One can only hope.  Enjoy!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Out of all the Foo Fighters albums I've listened to, this one is easily my favorite. Good luck finding a bad song anywhere on this one. I couldn't. There are awesome songs, and there are just some 'ok' songs. There are none that 'aren't' good. I think there is something for everyone here, as well. Some are kind of heavy, and some are soft and mello. It is well worth the 10 bucks. Definitely recommended!
0307592839|3.0|Like most of the reviewers, I picked up this book because of many, many positive reviews. I tend to like literary fiction and am more likely than not to enjoy stories other readers find difficult. Egan writes well, and the characters in Goon Squad are compelling, but the movement between time periods and characters was too much here. I found myself frantically paging back and forth to remind myself who Lulu was, who Joe (the descendant of the tribal African) was, Alex, Drew, LaDoll/Dolly, etc. Most of the characters make very brief appearances, so it's difficult to keep track of the tangential characters who keep turning up, and one could argue that some of them could be eliminated. I had a hard time differentiating between Jocelyn and Rhea, for example, as they only appear in two chapters, and each has one chapter from her perspective. I typically appreciate this type of narrative, but I struggled with it in this novel.<br /><br />I didn't particularly care for any of the characters, but I found the main characters well drawn and interesting. The most gimmicky part of the novel - the PowerPoint presentation - was probably my favorite. In very few words, Egan creates a vivid picture of Sasha's family dynamic and the emotional struggles of each member. It seems silly to say that a PowerPoint presentation can be poignant, but that's how I'd describe it.<br /><br />I can see why this novel got great reviews - there's much to respect here.  At the same time, I didn't really enjoy reading A Visit from the Goon Squad. It's difficult to lose yourself in a story that requires so much effort.
B00003CXB4|5.0|My 3-yr.-old granddaughter asked me for The Lion King dvd, over and over again. Well, this is one of those Disney movies that are only sold at special release times.

Thank you, Amazon, for making a little girl's dream come true.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this product for my Nikon D90 so that I could take it hiking with me and not have to worry about dropping it or about toting it around all day. This past weekend we went on a strenuous 12 mile hike through the mountains and I have to say that this backpack worked perfectly. There was plenty of room in the main compartment for all of my camera supplies and two lenses. I also had room to spare in the front pocket for a hydration bladder and snacks. In the front pocket I carried sunscreen, socks, baseball cap and trail maps. With the waist and chest straps the heavy load was bearable. My back did not hurt and I was comfortable the entire hike. This was the best 40 bucks that I have invested towards my camera. I plan on buying one for my friends who have DSLR's.

0321525655|5.0|Garr's book has been an extremely valuable resource for us to untrain ourselves on the, unfortunately very common, self-inflicted wounds companies tend to inflict on themselves and their audiences.  Like many companies, our presentations were nothing more than bullet pointed information that we were going to say anyways, way too much information, along with below average clip art.    Better than just a \\"how to\\" book, Garr walks you through a strategic approach to PowerPoint and makes you ask yourself a lot of questions relative to visual aids and marketing material.  If more people implemented Garr's approach in presentationzen, we'd have better all-around business meetings.  I can't tell you how critical I've become of other presentations now.    Make no mistake, implementing presentationzen is a process, and takes time.  But even when you're 1/4 or 1/2 way there, you're in a much better place than you were before you started.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is my favorite animated film.  When I was a child my family owned a videotape of this movie called \\"Warriors of the Wind.\\"  I thought it was the greatest cartoon in the world, and loved the character of Princess Zandra.  Then when I grew up and went to college, I discovered to my horror that my favorite anime movie had more than half an hour of its plot cut out of it for American audiences.  I quickly found a subtitled version of the original Japanese film.  It was better.  With this American release of the film, everyone can watch Miyazaki's animated masterpiece the way it was meant to be seen, with talented voice actors.  The film came out in the 80s, so some of the animation and music can seem dated.  I know some of the people I lend my copy of the film to seem to prefer the more modern Ghibli films.  (They're wrong of course--this one is the best.)<br /><br />The story is epic.  Young Nausicaa is the princess of a tiny kingdom trying to survive on a post-apocalypic Earth.  Her home, the Valley of the Wind, is caught up in a struggle between two powerful warring nations and the terrible threat of the Toxic Jungle and its giant insects.  Her quest to bring peace to her world on every front is spectacular and moving.<br /><br />Princess Nausicaa is the greatest anime heroine ever.  She is strong and kind and noble.  There is something otherworldly about her.  Which is perfect for the kind of mythical hero she is.  Not just an action heroine, she is also on a messianic journey to bring peace to the world.  The film's climax is emotional and pure.<br /><br />And then there is the song.  La la la la la la la la...it seems to reach inside you and lift you up.  Just beautiful.<br /><br />Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a beautiful, epic, post-apocalyptic fantasy.  It has deep themes of harmony with nature and one another, and the hero of the tale is such a wonderful character.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.  (And for those of you who like graphic novels, the series \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\\" is actually even better than the movie.  It runs for seven volumes and actually goes beyond the plot of the movie in volume 2, so you can see that there is much more story to tell.  To do true justice to Nausicaa's journey would probably require a trilogy of films.)eries \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\\" is actually even better than the movie.

B004LAIU4I|5.0|I love this new music from Paul Simon. \\"Getting Ready For Christnas\\" is an upbeat tune that makes me happy. This song sets the tone for the record. It makes me think of my loved ones who live away from me. My other favorite song is \\"Rewrite\\". I love the sound of the harp playing on this song. I also like the guitar playing on this song. It sounds groovy.  This song is a tribute to the working man.  I love this song very much.  Paul slows the tempo down a bit with the song \\"Love and Hard Times\\"  This song has a spiritual tone that I like very much.  This is a pretty song. \\"Dazzling Blue\\" is a track with a good beat.  I like the visual images that Paul creates with the lyrics.  I like the humor in the song \\"Afterlife\\". This is a pleasant song to listen to. \\"Amulet\\" is the only instrumental track here.  It is a lovely 96 seconds of acoustic guitar playing. \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\" has a lot of spirit.  This song has a great message.  It reminds me that I am in control of my life.  I love the musical arrangements of the song \\"Love And Blessings\\".  This song is a celebration of life. This tune is very good.  Love Is Sacred Light is a song with excellent harmonica playing.  I like the upbeat tone of this song. This song is a four minute party.  \\"Questions For The Angels\\" is a slower song. Paul's vocals are very soothing on this song.  I love the theme of faith in this song. The entire album is excellent.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book did exactly what it set out to do...find out the truth about Henrietta Lacks. The fact that the story is woven with so much information about other timely pertinent cases and scientific research made it more interesting. The fact that the author ended up befriending the Lacks family and was able to bring their personal story into it made it a gem.<br /><br />If you enjoy intelligent, yet not over your head, non-fiction that reads like a fantastic novel, this is the book for you.
1906694176|4.0|I agree with many reviewers that this conclusion to the Millennium Trilogy was the weakest in terms of writing quality, but that may be due to the author's untimely death (is death ever timely? I digress).  However, as a wrap-up to the story, it was highly satisfying and well worth reading.<br /><br />The book picks up right where the second left off - with Lisbeth being evacuated to a hospital after being shot by Zalachenko.  This novel has a very different feel from the first two.  Those were more suspenseful thrillers, whereas this felt more like a John Grisham legal thriller.  Most of the book is concerned with Blomkvist's and the police's investigation(s) to determine just what the heck has happened, and who's to blame.  The actual trial does not occur until very near the end.  I felt the quality was lacking due to an overabundance of unnecessary detail (every new character that is introduced gets pages and pages and pages of backstory), a lot of history and explanation about the Swedish legal and parliamentary systems, and a lot less dialog.  At times, it felt like info dumps on steroids!  There was also an unrelated and unnecessary subplot concerning Berger that simply kept readers away from the main story.  Despite this, I gave the book four stars because there were a lot of fun and exciting aspects to the story.  Lisbeth brings in some of her hacker friends to assist with evidence gathering; there is a lot of spying, counter-spying and other nefarious goings on that keep a reader guessing who has the upper hand at any one time.  The book wrapped up every thread, the villains all get their comeuppance, and the trial was exciting and succinct - especially the cross-examination of Dr. Teleborian.  Overall, highly recommended to fans of the first two books.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|One of Tarantino's best and craziest! He really goes all out with his foot fetish here, so that's a huge bonus for all those that love feet and legs. I mainly love the campy yet oddly compelling nature of this movie. He is a master of mood music and classic homages, and he doesn't disappoint here. It isn't for everyone, but none of his movies are really. If you love his other stuff, you will enjoy this one as well! It is one of my personal favorites.
B004NGYXIM|2.0|I am a huge Mana fan who has been looking forward to this album for a long time and sadly I was disappointed. I only like 3 songs from the entire album. (Lluvia al Corazon, El Espejo, El Dragon) The rest of the tracks are very bland, not horrible, but not great. They are not the memorable kind of songs that made Mana famous around the world. I find myself skipping most of these boring songs to get to the three I mentioned.    Save your money. Just buy a few individual tracks or \\"borrow\\" this one from a friend.
0385737955|4.0|This is one trippy little book. By the time I finished, I had even more questions than when I started. I felt it was really slow moving, and at times I wanted to give up on it and move on to something a little more fast paced.    I kept thinking of [[ASIN:B0036EH3WU Lost: The Complete Collection]] while I was reading this, and I think that kind of helped. The kids in this book are trying to solve a puzzle, as were the castaways on the mysterious island in LOST.    I think overall the world building was pretty good, and this book is just kind of a huge, long prologue for what is to come. I am still trying to decide if I want to continue with this series. From the epilogue, I think that [[ASIN:0385738757 The Scorch Trials (Maze Runner Trilogy, Book 2)]] is going to be similar to what [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] was to [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]--just like the first book all over again, but a different setting and different trials.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I agree a lot with mllle.x, the reviewer, who only gave the book 1 star.  The reviewer did a good job pointing out the flaws in the book.  It's 500 pages with not much action (yoga doesn't count!), and there's going to be a sequel, one of many, I assume.  The main character comes across so smug in the beginning that it was hard for me to like her.  However, I give the author credit for coming up with a very interesting idea of combining vampires, witches, demons and other creatures with science and history.  The book reminds me a bit of Twilight, Harry Potter and Da Vinci Code all rolled up into one.  Like Twilight, there's a the hot vampire with an overprotective/stalkerish streak.  The heroine, like Bella in Twilight, has amazing powers but she doesn't know how to use them and is frustratingly clueless about the world around her (despite her overachieving personality and supposed brilliance).  Like the Harry Potter series, the world is full of magic, dark and good, like time travel, spells, potions and curses, but us normal humans just don't see it.  Unlike Harry Potter, there's a lack of wonder about the magic.  Even though Diana has not practiced magic, she's grown up with it all her life, and she doesn't have the wonder that Harry did in the first Potter book.  The enchanted house she grew up in was delightful, but Diana doesn't explain anything about the house to Matthew when they arrive. Then there are all these random scientific and historic tangents that span Darwin, ancient texts and the imagined Knights of Lazarus (standing in for the Knights of Templar) similar to the Da Vinci Code.  The difference is that A Discovery of Witches doesn't have the quickly moving plot pace of the Da Vinci Code.  I didn't hate this book, but I don't think I can muster the patience to read another 500 pages in book 2, unless that is the last book. I was most annoyed that it took 500 pages to just set up the story, which will be played out in the sequel.

B004QL7K8O|5.0|This is a truly hilarious movie that spoofs the horror genre in a brilliant way. I haven't laughed so much at a film for years. I don't understand why this film hasn't got a wide release. So much of what Hollywood produces these days is a yawn-fest, and here is a funny, original movie that so few people will ever get to see. It's a complete mystery. I eagerly await the DVD release, as this movie will be a gem in my collection.

1604680547|5.0|If you do any of your own quilting, by long arm machine, on your sewing machine or by hand, this book is a must have. I have subscribed to Quiltmaker Magazine since I first became aware of the quality of the quilting patterns they included in their magazine. The time and energy that they put into thinking what designs will most compliment their quilts is extensive. This book brings 501 of those designs together into a wonderful collection.    Quilt designs included range from holiday themes, animals, traditional feathered motifs, baby, season and abstract designs. One of the best things about this book is the extensive thought that has gone into how to use each of the quilting designs. The basic pattern is presented, and then suggestions for use in borders, in center squares and possible placement in a variety of arrangements.      The book itself is spiral bound to make copying patterns easier, either by hand or on a scanner. I have scanned (for personal use only) many of the designs to adapt the size for the specific project I was working on. The spiral binding makes this particularly easy. Designs are presented by theme, but an alphabetical index as well as a motif size index are provided in the back of the book.    In addition to the amazing quilting patterns, the book also includes a section on how to choose the right design for your quilt, optimizing your layout on the quilt, and determining placement. This is one of the most helpful sections, particularly for novice quilters.    \\"501 Quilting Motifs\\" by Quiltmaker Magazine is a book that I would recommend to any and all quilters, because the quilting really does make the quilt.

159102594X|5.0|The First Blade is the first of a trilogy by Joe Abercrombie.  This is the second book of Abercrombie's that I have read - the first being \\"Best Served Cold\\" - and both were enchanting.  The Blade Itself follows several characters whose fates are slowly becoming intertwined.  Each chapter follows another character and this is done seamlessly.  The rich story flows effortlessly with plenty of political intrigue, hack and slash fighting, magical spells, a sword-fighting contest, and a quick approaching war is constantly in the background.  What really makes the book so much fun to read are the well rounded characters. Glotka is a crippled interrogator for the Inquisition who longs for his own death.  Bayaz, the first of the Magi, is a most powerful wizard who is hundreds of years old - that most believe to be an imposter.  Capt Luthar is a contestant in the sword fighting contest, and is falling in love with his friend and commanding officer's commoner sister.  And then there is Logen Ninefingers, a named man of the North - a hun-like warrior who has been summoned by Bayaz for an unknown purpose. I find Abercrombie's writing addictive and have already bought the remainder of the trilogy as well as his other stand-alone sequel \\"The Heroes\\".
1594202842|1.0|I am so glad I did not waste my money on this drivel. I did not get very far through the library's copy before I was sufficiently nauseated to stop reading. I realize, though, that in Ms. Chua's warped world, that this makes me a worthless and underachieving human being. I believe that Ms. Chua personifies the worst in closed-minded arrogance and racial stereotyping. I recently attended a concert by a major American symphony orchestra, in which an extended family member has a prominent position (I mention this because music is an area in which Ms. Chua chooses to disparage the success and work ethic of Americans). In a day and age when the American people are told by people like Ms. Chua that we are all a bunch of collective screw-ups, it was reassuring to see a stage full of Americans of all skin tones at the top of their game - not just by the American standards, but the standards of the world. And it was nice to see these people visibly enjoying what they are doing. Conversely, Ms. Chua even goes so far as to say that nothing is worth doing unless \\"you can win a medal at it,\\" the overt message being that enjoyment is irrelevant to competitive success. In the end, I feel sorry for Ms. Chua. I doubt she really knows what it means to truly enjoy anything, professionally or recreationally. Again, I'm sure in her mind, I would be just another fifth-rate academic imprisoned by the mediocrity implicit in teaching at a large state university, but I'll take that over being imprisoned by a competitive streak so intense that it precludes the enjoyment of anything other than \\"winning\\" (her words).

B004E2XAFW|5.0|This CD isn't like their past CD's, but then again, none of them are the exact same in style.  This CD, The Unforgiving, is great though.  The music and lyrics are beautiful and her voice is amazing as ever!
1400079144|3.0|Let me start with this.  If you have never read a Dan Brown book, this was very good.      If you have, however, prepare to be mildly disappointed.  I say mildly because all of the good things we expect from dan brown are there.  The deception, the multi-layered conspiracy, and the eventual rescue of the beautiful damsel in distress.  It just seems a little flat.    Not bad by any means, but not 'The Da Vinci Code' and certainly not 'Angels And Demons.'      Without spoiling the book for those who haven't read it, I will merely say that there are several things in here I was forced to wonder how the great Robert Langdon fell for.    Still a good book, but not the best we have seen from Dan Brown.

0738212415|5.0|I bought this book elsewhere after losing my copy of \\"Draw Squad.\\" Before using his book I cannot say how many failed attempts I had at learning to draw - dozens! I lost the first book after completing about half of it, and I was excited to see this one for adults. I'm halfway through this one now and the results are awesome! I may be able to realize my childhood dream of becoming a cartoonist. You go from rendering simple shapes to experimenting with figure drawing exercises in 30 lessons. It goes farther than \\"Draw Squad,\\" which means that even if I find the old book I still have new material.  Also: there are complementary lessons on his website and I highly recommend those too. Mr. Kistler was very responsive to a problem I had with the site - my email was answered the next day!  If you have trouble with the exercises I suggest doing them over and over - I think that is what worked for me. If you have trouble with the shading try a different pencil. I use \\"H\\" (hard) for sketching and \\"B\\" or \\"2B\\" for dark lines and shading.
B00001OH7N|5.0|You can hear so many other artists have taken from this album. It is a must have for any collector.
B0028K3192|5.0|I loved the album from beginning to end. There are no songs that I need to skip past I love them all. However I was a bit disappointed that there are only 9 songs and 1 of them is an instrumental only. I waited a long time for another Maxwell CD, so I was expecting much more than 8 or 9 songs. But then again I wasn't disappointed enough to subtract any stars from my rating. So all in all I was completely satisfied with the songs that were on the CD even though they were so few in number.
0201633612|5.0|Like it or not, you could not proclaim to be an object-oriented specialist without having read this book.  Very enlightening particularly for beginners in this interesting topic. To make the most of this book, don't forget to put things into practice!.
0316056863|5.0|Oh the agony of choosing to listen to a book or read it! I listened to Bossypants and got an experience that those who will read this book will clearly miss. Don't misunderstand - I have the advantage of having terribly funny teenagers who have grown up in Ms. Fey's generation of humor accentuated with random comments, and so understand the vital timing of her delivery of mostly funny humor. I also understand that comedians rarely generate non-stop great jokes ( a fact that Fey readily admits) but - hey - this is a memoir, the author is entitled to have her voice in its own authentic way.     On the other hand, I missed almost all of the great pictures that obviously came with the printed version. You'll have to decide which you care for most.     This memoir is not only funny, but filled with the great kind of people who helped produce this hard working, intelligent, unpretentious and terribly funny person-who-deserves-success. If the world turns its back on Tina Fey tomorrow, she'll still find a way to be a good person (but I hope not the next version of Dr. Laura - because she does have that \\"Hey everybody, follow the rules!!\\" mentality). As expected, the story surrenders up nuggets of behind-the-scenes vignettes on various celebs. Best of all though, Bossypants, in the words of another great comedian: \\"simply shows what everyone might achieve by simply doing right.\\"
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is the definition of a true classic, it's ahead of its time both lyrically and musically, it's also timeless.  This album alone is enough to hold Nas in the highest esteem amongst anyone who listens to hip-hop.  Although many feel he fell-off that's BS, it's purely because he raised the bar so high with this album that anything released after it would ultimately be below this standard, and that simply can't be helped.
1400052181|5.0|Ms. Skloot prevails in this reveal of a great medical breakthrough and injustice by braiding the medical, historical and current study in family struggle with her own challenges researching the story with really great timing. I know many who have difficulty with medical detail or dry research material and I would urge even those to trust that in this story, just when the one line of information becomes a little intense, that chapter ends, and another aspect of the history is interestingly presented.    This author also does an excellent job of bringing the scientific process down to easy laymans's terms. One leaves this book grateful for the persistence and accidental sheer luck that goes into scientific pursuit and the people who choose this type of work. There are interesting parallels to be drawn in considering the stubborn qualities of those few scientists who choose knowledge-sharing over profit, and the often benighted heirs of Henrietta Lack's own decendents who make their life choices, usually in keeping with their backgrounds, but occasionally, bravely rising to the challenge of demanding justice at great cost.    This book deserves the attention it has been given.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I can't believe this movie won anything! I was so looking forward to seeing it after all of the wonderful reviews and the awards. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations at all. It was odd and disjointed, and the acting (with the exception of Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis, and whoever the actress is that coaches Natalie Portman in the \\"swan\\" movements) was horrendous. I'd never seen Ms. Portman in anything. Based on this movie, I think she has to be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. Also, the use of the f-word seemed so forced and artificial, as though it was simply put into the script because someone thought that audiences just expect it in films; and some of the other lines seemed to have been added only for their supposed shock value. The club/drug scene was one of the most bizarre things I've seen and didn't add any value at all to the movie. Finally, some of the sound effects are ridiculous, really laughable. Just an overall disappointment and waste of money.    UPDATE:  Since I continued to hear how wonderful it was, I decided to give it another try (and another and another), thinking that perhaps I'd been too harsh and had missed something somehow. However, the more I watched it the more awful I thought it was. Then I watched a story on 20/20 about it, and became even more convinced it was garbage. Turns out the main reason Natalie Portman won an Oscar for her role was because the Academy voters (and the rest of the world) were led to believe that she did most/all of the dancing herself, which is a lie, and if they'd known she didn't they wouldn't have voted for her in the first place since the dancing was such a huge part of the role. Now I'm thoroughly disgusted with the whole thing and am throwing it in the trash where it belongs.
0765326353|5.0|Sleepless nights, burning eyes, missed work; all side effects of reading anything Sanderson writes; this book is no exception. Brandon creates a new world which defies imagination and takes you to a new would only he could dream up. Four characters make up this book; these characters will not let you go. The amount of thought and detail in these characters, not to mention the characters that orbit them, is amazing. The magic is amazing. Read this book if you are a fan of fantasy or if you want to know what fantasy is; this is true fantasy on the most epic of scales.
0714844659|5.0|I love this book! Beautiful photography and the recipes range from really simple to medium difficulty.   It's about the food, not calories or time spent. I've made about 6 items so far and each is an excellent blend of tastes.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I don't think that you could get a better set for these movies than this.  All of these movies look fantastic in high def. The picture quality looks extremely good, and the audio is also what I was hoping for : Awesome !!!  I have always been a big fan of these movies, and if you are a fan as well, I would say go buy it !!!  With all 4 movies & tons of extras, there should be no reason not to get it !!!
0446195529|5.0|Reading this book right now I would have to say that it bis a very action packed book.  I would expect nothing less from this wonderfully talented writer who I thing is on par with an author like James Patterson.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is such a refreshing well thought out treatment of an absolute classic. It will loved by all who enjoy drama, gore and the odd well delivered chill. Though it's not riddled with Zombie gore it has enough to keep most blood and guts fans happy. If you're looking for well acted character driven human drama, look no further. This is a modern day classic of television that not unlike that book you read long ago that you just could not put down. Don't be surprised if you are tempted to watch all 6 episodes in one sitting.  Technicaly the production values are great with outstanding special effect most of which are the old fashion type not relying soley on CG.  You will not be sorry when you purchase this!  Bring on the next series!!!
B001JEENV8|5.0|Still one of the best Pop Album that I got... I bought another copy because the first 2 that I've owned was borrowed by my cousin and friend but was never returned... I love Maroon 5's music!!!
B0041KKYEM|2.0|The acting is over-wrought and the pretentious nature of this neurotic dancer story creates an atmosphere of dread and nausea.Special effects are used to accentuate her dementia. ..Natalie Portman And Barbara Hershey do a theatrical job wringing their hands, in a disturbed mother daughter love hate frenzy.Here you have the cliched mom \\"didn't get to be a star\\" hateful stage mother,and the bulimic possessed anorexic daughter.The end is predictable and  sensational.What happened to the days of understatement?Who will die for art?. It's all been said before. The movie is OK,but just OK,and not something to look at twice.It doesn't live up to its art house film aspirations.If you don't enjoy eating disorders and  self mutilation leave this one on the shelf.The acting is good,but the viewer has to decide if the movie is.
1906694176|5.0|I read all three books and loved each one.  I am so sad that Lisbeth died with the author.  No one else could replicate his style of writing and unusual plots.
0385333846|3.0|Usually when I read a new author I tend to dive into their most known work. It's interesting which books seem to become \\"classics\\". This was a good read, but I'm not sure I'd call it essential. I've seen it on many \\"must read\\" lists. Mostly it's about war, and how this guy deals with it in the years that pass. Oh, and he's also taken by aliens...and time travels. Maybe. Because alot of this book jumps around in time, it's occasionally hard to follow.<br /><br />That's also what makes it interesting. If this was just a day in the life of a veteran I might have been bored. In some ways I feel like I read three books at the same time. He's a POW...he's an optometrist...he's on another planet naked. Part of his time was spent in a Vermont hospital after his plane crashed into a mountain. I live near that mountain so that was kind of cool.<br /><br />Not many times do you read a novel about mass murder and destruction, yet remains fairly light and casual...and is part sci-fi. I'd suggest this book based on it being a fairly easy read, being so known, and I did like it. Have I read better books? Many. But none that used the phrase \\"so it goes\\" 106 times.
0316056863|4.0|I love Tina Fey and think 30 Rock is the best thing on TV. I enjoyed the book but found it superficial on some levels. I would have preferred more detail on her creative instincts, how she developed 30 Rock (she talks about it, but spends little time on the detail of character creation, etc). She says almost nothing about her husband other than to tell an amusing story about a cruise gone awry. It also seemed a bit padded with transcripts of sketches. All in all, funny and enjoyable, I just hoped for more.
1591396190|3.0|I am a Chinese reader, from my point of view, the most function for this book is to change your mind. Such as how to make profit on the most impossible point and how to get the market that nobody wants. There is no step by step teaching you how to create your own blue ocean in the book. However, it tells you how to change your thought based on the information you have already had, how to deal with the view between superior and subordinate, even emphasized word of \\"Relationships\\" or \\"Network\\" which are highly important in China. Also, how to estimate the strengths and the opportunities of yourself and your competitors, and how to catch the Blue Ocean base on your analysis are the most impressive part of the book.    Here is a simple compare between \\"Red Ocean Strategy \\"and \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\".  In Michael Porter's Five Forces Analysis, the competitor in the industry is the one of the indispensable part. However, it is nothing because there is even no competition in the Blue Ocean, not even the rules because there are even no rules in the clean pure market. The traditional Red Ocean strategy is tell us how to defeat your competitors, while the Blue Ocean strategy tell us how to defeat what your competitors are thinking to make them ignore us to be competitor of theirs. Then, we focus on the customer's needs - not the existing needs but the potential needs.     The blue ocean strategy is the guide book teaching you how to overcome the competition or in another word, the Blue Ocean will become Red Ocean eventually but just a beginning. Personally speaking, the Blue Ocean strategy is not a subversion of the Red Ocean strategy, but a supplementary, complete or development.
B000001Y5J|4.0|This was my first cd ever, and I wasn't dissapointed.  Fans of industrial metal (if its even called that anymore), rock, and other such genres will be into this, but at this rate, who hasn't heard of Nine Inch Nails in the first place?  Not a bad selection if you need some good metal.

0316044695|5.0|First warning, SEALS are very arrogant, but Marcus accepts it and even tries to give reason behind it. I was frustrated in the beginning mostly because I thought the whole book would be about his time in battle. I didn't realize that the book is really 2 stories in one. The first half of the book I gained an immense respect for what it takes to become a Navy SEAL which became completely necessary for me to effectively relate to the story as it went on. The writing is really as if you have Marcus in front of you relaying the story to you in his own words- slang and all. You can tell Marcus is truly the one telling his story, which I felt added to the connection I felt to him and his comrades.<br /><br />About half way through, the story completely lost momentum in the transition between his training and the battlefield. Stick with it and you wont be disappointed. The back half of the book Marcus found a way to entwine what was happening back home on his family ranch in with all that was going on in Afghanistan. I couldn't stop reading. I found myself brought to tears on several occasions, but not in the way I expected. I expected to feel loss and sorrow for those who I knew would inevitably fall in combat, but instead it was tears for the bravery, selflessness, and courage of those soldiers as they kept fighting.<br /><br />An amazing story, a first hand account, and a fantastic tribute to those Fallen SEALS who gave it all to fight for the freedoms they so firmly believed in. Though I had a respect for the military before, I have an even greater respect for them now
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|Foo Fighters return with album number seven \\"Wasting Light\\" and it's a back to basics approach as the album was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage which is in Los Angeles, the album also marks the full time return of guitarist Pat Smear(the germs, nirvana) who toured with the band for 2007's \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\\" and also played on the track \\"Let It Die\\" from the same album, he was the original guitarist in the band and appeared on 1997's \\"The Colour And The Shape\\". Former Nirvana band mate Krist Novoselic also appears on the album, on the track \\"I Should Have Known\\". Also producer of Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" Butch Vig(Garbage) is on hand to produce the album continuing on from producing \\"Wheels\\" and \\"Word Forward\\" from Foo's greatest hits release. Alan Moulder(nine inch nails, depeche mode, a perfect circle, the killers and loads more) Mixed the album.     So it's all very well having all the names on board, the question is the album any good? Well yes indeed it is. From opener \\"Bridge Burning\\" the Foo's break out the big anthem style rock that they are renowned for! yes it includes Dave's trademark screaming. Many a Arena or Stadium will be rocking out to this. First single \\"Rope\\" continues the pace beginning with dual guitarists before the drums and bass kick in, of course Foo Fighters now have 3 guitarists in their line up, Grohl, Smear and Chris Shiflett, so you can be guaranteed no shortage of big riffs.     One of the albums highlights is \\"Dear Rosemary\\" which features Bob Mould who was famously the Vocalist and guitar player in Hüsker Dü and is one of Dave Grohl's hero's! The track features Mould on Guitar and backing vocals and it features a big sounding bass and drums not unlike The Raconteurs \\"Steady As She Goes\\". with \\"White Limo\\" it's like going back in time to the Foo Fighters self titled debut album, and wouldn't sound out of place on that album, Grohl has the band sounding like Queens Of The Stone Age when Nick Oliveri used to be in the band and do vocals, it's 100 miles an hour stuff. While \\"Alandria\\" starts off sounding like a Them Crooked Vultures track(for whom grohl is the drummer) before slipping back in to safer Foo Fighters Territory.     \\"These Days\\" slows the pace of the album down and is a big ballad sounding track that Grohl is no stranger to. \\"Back & Forth\\" shows what a fine rhythm section the Foo Fighters have in drummer Taylor Hawkins and Bassist Nate Mendel. \\"I Should Have Known\\" which reunites Grohl with former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic who plays both bass and accordion on the track is a song about his best friend Jimmy Swanson who died in 2008 of a drug overdose, Swanson has been on the road with Grohl from the start of his carear in Scream right up to the last Foo Fighters world tour. It's one of the most touching songs Grohl has every written and it's also one of his best. Fittingly the album closes with \\"Walk\\" which has Grohl singing about never wanting to die.     Dave Grohl has often talked about having an album that will be remembered and referenced long after the band have gone, he even once scrapped an album worth of material that he thought wasn't good enough(the new material recorded would eventually go on to become One By One) after touring and recording the excellent \\"Song For The Deaf\\" with Queens Of The Stone Age, so he's always set the bar high. \\"Wasting Light\\" mightn't be anything new musically or world changing but it is a fine rocking album that Grohl and the Foo Fighters can be proud of!
0385737955|5.0|After reading Hunger Games and City of Ember, I was excited to move on to another Science Fiction Young Adult novel. This book was exciting! I loved the edge of mystery, the slow unraveling of memories, and the constant twists and turns. The book is well written, though there were a couple of things that bothered me. I like to be able to picture creatures and surrounding in my mind as the author intends them- I want to see what they see. James Dashner is a great story teller, but not particulary detailed in his descriptions of creatures and people. I never really could picture the main characters or the Grievers and other creatures in the story. Also, there is some telepathic communication that occures- but each time it happens, the author re explains it. I wish he would have just used the italics to signify the communication and left it at that. Often times I felt like the author was \\"dumbing things down\\" a bit too much.<br /><br />That said, this was a fantastic story! Original, intriguing, creative. I really enjoyed trying to peice together the story in my mind as I went. It wasn't overly predictable and the characters personalities were rich and diverse. Some of the writing was redundant, but overall enjoyable. I almost would have prefered it to be in first person rather then having to say the main characters name over and over again. A fantastic read for young adults, it isn't as gruesome as Hunger Games or as graffic.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all young adults, it may even be appropriate for some teenagers. This is certainly fast paced and will keep you on your toes. I am dying to see what happens next in this 3 book series!
B0015HOFZI|1.0|Purchased this item as a 2010 Christmas present. After 4 months of light use it already does not work (needle will not stay on record, returns to seat) and of course Amazon has washed their hands and Sony is making me pay the shipping to a repair center (probably 20% of the cost of the item). Save your money
0385738757|5.0|Often times the 2nd book doesn't live up to the first, not in this case. I think I actually liked this book BETTER then the first! The bonds the Gladers developed when escaping the Maze deepens as this new adventure unfolds. Thomas begins to regain more and more memories as we start to better understand his role in it all. I have the same complaints with this book as I did the first, but it didn't seem to bother me as much in this book- perhaps I have just grown used to Dashners style. After reading this book I am even more entwined in this adventurous journey! I am very much looking forward to book 3 in the fall and will certainly be preordering my copy. If you enjoyed The Maze Runner, you will love this book. I was constantly wondering what was going to happen next, never completely sure where each characters loyalties lay, and loving the dream sequences and further insight to Thomas' past.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Allow me to open this with an admission: I am a HUGE R.E.M. apologist (with the interesting exception of their 1999 single \\"The Apologist\\" off the Up record, which I did not care for (Up, however, I feel is a great collection which is better appreciated now with more years under it)). Be that as it may, I am still able of listening to the bands music critically and while I can find justification is near-every of the bands artistic decisions through the years (I really mind mind Around The Sun! And when Reveal came out, I listened to it a lot. Nowadays, not so much) I am not afraid to call out my heroes when a gamble doesn't pay off.    Thankfully I am not having to do that today. R.E.M.'s 15th full-length album Collapse Into Now is brilliant. I am weary of calling anything created in this modern age a masterpiece and I won't relinquish that distinction for this album, but it is close as you can get. What makes Collapse Into Now so great is they feel comfortable bouncing forth and back from pop-centric radio singles (\\"My Smells Like Honey,\\" \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter,\\" \\"That Someone is You,\\" \\"All The Best\\") and moody, Bush-era Stipeian angst (\\"Oh My Heart,\\" \\"Walk It Back,\\" \\"Uberlin\\"). The flow of the album is a bit janky at times, most noticeably following the aforementioned \\"That Someone is You\\" with the beautiful, but superbly mellow \\"Me, Marlon Brand, Marlon Brando and I,\\" but that change-up sets the stage for the closing, near spoken word \\"blue\\" which references the titular concept of 20th century collapsing into the present day.    Collapse Into Now is the 2nd album in a row where lead singer Michael Stipe sings self-referential lines to the groups previous word (previously seen on Accelerates \\"Sing For the Submarine.\\") On this albums fourth track, Stipe references \\"the storm didn't kill me/the government changed\\" a direct reference to his line \\"if the storm doesn't kill me/the government will\\" from the Katrina-centric song \\"Houston\\" on Accelerate.In fact, the themes in \\"Oh My Heart\\" regarding a return to a place once special and the joy to ones heart brought by this homecoming, in addition to make similarities musically, might make \\"Oh My Heart\\" a direct sequel to \\"Houston;\\" another R.E.M. first!    Choice tracks coming out of \\"Collapse Into Now\\" included all of the above mentioned songs in addition to \\"It Happened Today,\\" \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter,\\" \\"Walk It Back,\\" \\"That Someone Is You.\\"    Collapse into Now is an incredible album and merely knowing that this record exists returns to me hope that music, in this modern era can be saved again.    Highly recommended.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I heard from Japanese reviews that the voice over actors are not well.  I noticed it a little, but it does not bother me that much.    The story is amazing and made me keep watching this movie over and over again.  I think this story capture Japanese cultures.
B0048PU7TC|4.0|The title of the album is \\"Featuring Norah Jones\\"...that pretty much gives it away that she's not going to be the main artist on ANY of the songs. She's a FEATURING artist on someone else's song. I'm not sure why a lot of people were surprised by that. I think it's pretty interesting to see artists cross genres and experiment with different kinds of music. It also exposes you to different artists you may have never come across otherwise *shrug*.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|All I can say is WOW!..these guys never cease to amaze me and this newest album is a masterpiece. Don't take my word for it..just go listen to a few samples. Not one bad tune in the bunch.
B000E41MRC|5.0|Very good quality film. Unfortunately there exist very poor quality copies on the market, but this is to be recommended.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Yes, I saw the movie first.<br />Yes, I know the movie almost line by line.<br />Yes, the movie is one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />Given that, you would think that I wouldn't like the book or that somehow it didn't live to my expectations, wow, was I wrong! I've read the book at least three times already, its that good. I read somewhere that the movie and book are two different animals.. and they are, both of them perfect in their own created world.<br /><br />The movie is not so much about hitting bottom as the book, in the movie there's a sort of coolness about the characters, the book is about how cool it is to not be cool. Marla is very important in the book and you learn to appreciate her character better. There are a lot of similarities and you will find yourself saying \\"wow, I remember that from the movie\\" more than once, believe me.<br /><br />The writing style of the author I like but could see other people not digging it as much. The way I describe his writing style is that he writes as we think, the human being does not work in paragraphs, we think in lines, sometimes just in words, and thats how the book is written.
0380730367|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Lehane though I watched Gone, Baby, Gone and Mystic River and enjoyed both. I figured it was about time I read one of his books as we all know, books are generally better than the movie. I was not disappointed, this was a great piece of crime fiction.<br />Not only was the plot fast paced and well-written, with plenty of twists, but the character development was great. I loved the interactions between Patrick and Bubba, who is a character unlike any other. Throw in Angie, who had left Patrick after Gone, Baby, Gone, she rejoins the team for this one, intrigued as they look for this person who completely destroyed a woman's life for no apparent reason.<br /><br />There is a lot of graphic violence but it didn't bother me, it added to the credibility of the story. I'm not sure whether Patrick and Angie are PI's so much as vigilantes in this one, but I enjoyed it very much. I've heard the next installment doesn't have as much Bubba, though it goes back to the story from Gone, Baby, Gone. I'll probably read it though I'll miss Bubba. I am also pretty sure I am going to read Shutter Island which I heard was much better than the movie which I did not see.<br /><br />I can see why Lehane is so popular. If you like the mystery/thriller genre with a little edge, I think you will enjoy this book.<br />my rating 4.5/5
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Hbo does it again with a new rackets' series , this one is no disapointment either, but then again, hbo never disapoints !! Boardwalk Empire has all the marking's of a great gangster series and I'm sure it's going to be one. Steve Bushemi is perfect as nucky and is well deserving of the starring role , all the other characters are superb as well , especially jimmy and chalky !! the scene's take you back to a place of wonder and underworld adventure. The story line jumps from one vice ran city to another which keeps you wanting more , and believe me ,...you'll want more!! The Chicago faction is simply outstanding !! and jimmy's new right hand man is right on point. An all around great series!!!!\\"your boy jimmy,... my boy\\" A simply must have if you collect mob genre movies.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Just wanted to give a heads-up: the bonus tracks for this album are available on Amazon, but for whatever reason the Deluxe album does not come up when you search for \\"Wasting Light.\\" So search for the track name \\"Better Off\\" and then click on that track's album name. There's also an extended version of the Deadmau 5 remix of Rope. Both tracks cap off a return to greatness and tour de force for the Foo Fighters. So excited these songs are available ala carte for those of us who elected to buy the CD version (and how cool, each initial-run CD includes a piece of the master tape).<br /><br />Mad props to Butch Vig, who has produced half of my top ten albums of all time: Smashing Pumpkins (Gish), Against Me! (New Wave, White Crosses) and Nirvana's Nevermind. Butch adds a crisp, sonic whallop to the proceedings that I feel were missing from the last album. And after the tepid bonus tracks on the Greatest Hits disc, I was worried the band was destined to fade into mid-tempo oblivion.<br /><br />Mad props to Them Crooked Vultures - that intense album and tour re-ignited Dave's fury and passion - this album crackles with energy as if they are a new band with everything to prove and nothing left to lose. Wasted Light is their best since Colour & The Shape and who knows, with enough listens, perhaps the best album ever. Warning, for best results, play this album very loud.<br /><br />This is the best week ever to be a Foo fan. VH1 is running their stellar documentary, Back and Forth. They've been on SNL, The Daily Show and Letterman. And this Saturday, yet another record drops (their full-length vinyl album of cover songs).<br /><br />Long live the Foo Fighters!
B003Y8YXH6|3.0|Appreciating this remixing of DOUBLE FANTASY is a lot easier to do if you were pre-disposed to liking the original album in the first place. With all due respect to John Lennon and Yoko Ono, I never did. My first reaction when it came out (a mere three weeks before Lennon's horrible murder) was, \\"this guy has a lot of gall trashing Paul McCartney for sounding syrupy.\\" I don't know why he decided to put these songs out instead of the far better ones that eventually ended up on the posthumous MILK AND HONEY four years later, but with the exceptions of \\"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy),\\" \\"I'm Losing You\\" and \\"Woman,\\" nothing Lennon released on DOUBLE FANTASY is even close to having the muscle, grit or smarts of his best songs, loud OR soft. Had he been spared death and subsequently released in final form the songs that appeared on MILK AND HONEY, I suspect most listeners and fans would have relegated DOUBLE FANTASY to a warm-up after almost 5 years out of the spotlight and given more praise to \\"I Don't Wanna Face It, \\"Grow Old With Me\\" and \\"Nobody Told Me,\\" all much, much better songs than the bulk of what Lennon chose for DOUBLE FANTASY. The tragedy that happened after DF's release added extra gravitas to a parcel of second-rate songs.<br /><br />So, I put my bias on the table, straight up. Does the stripping down of the DOUBLE FANTASY tracks help redress the strength of the material at all? Wellll....sort of. It definetely doesn't hurt the aforementioned tracks, but they were pretty good to start with. It also does benefit \\"(Just Like) Starting Over,\\" one of Lennon's most overrated songs, but it doesn't really help \\"Cleanup Time,\\" a song only marginally better than Paul and Linda McCartney's \\"Cook Of The House.\\" In that instance \\"polishing waste matter\\" is about what happens here. And \\"Watching The Wheels,\\" was Lennon at his most self-defensive...I never could hear this song without thinking that he sent out 2 conflicting messages with it: \\"Leave me alone, but listen to me.\\"<br /><br />The reason I have so little to say about what Yoko Ono has on DOUBLE FANTASY is NOT because I don't think her songs are worth mentioning. On the contrary, what carries DOUBLE FANTASY along, in any incarnation, are HER songs. I know, I know, sacriledge, but \\"Kiss, Kiss, Kiss,\\" \\"I'm Moving On\\" and \\"Hard Times Are Over\\" all have a verve and bite that most of Lennon's songs here don't. Ono will probably never get a fair hearing from Lennon partisans, and in some cases prior to DF the dislike of her offerings was warranted, but not this time. If the intention of John and Yoko was to show that she really was pretty good, it works; it's just too bad that doing so was at Lennon's expense.<br /><br />I know I'm going to get creamed for all I've said here in the responses, but I stand by every word. John Lennon proved by the material that was released after the world lost him that he still had the spark, so why he chose many of the songs on DOUBLE FANTASY instead of what he'd stockpiled for later will forever be a mystery.he reason I have so little to say about what Yoko Ono has on DOUBLE FANTASY is NOT because I don't think her songs are worth mentioning.

0385738757|4.0|The Maze Runner was my favorite book of 2009 and I've waited a full year for Scorch. In this sequel, he turned The Maze Runner story upside down, inside out, and backwards. Once you begin any book by Dashner, it is nearly impossible to put it down. The same is true for Scorch. I loved the pacing and constant suspense, trying to figure out the riddle and wondering where we were going to end up next - from page to page to page. I didn't really like the change of relationship between Thomas and Teresa. We'll see what happens in book 3. It's a roller coaster ride. Buckle up!!

B002WYH5N2|3.0|I was extremely disappointed when I got this movie because the packaging was different than I was expecting. In the reviews a customer wrote that the cover was made to look like a book and that there was a booklet inside with pictures and that it came with the soundtrack. After ordering this movie and expecting it to look the way the customer described it, I was really disappointed. After I got the movie I went on Amazon to see if I got the wrong one, but apparently the customer was reviewing a different collectors edition. I only wish that the review would be showing for that specific item that they actually purchased, whether it be like the one the customer described or the one that I bought and it wasn't the one the review was written about. I still absolutely love this movie and I will watch it over and over. But if you're like me and are expecting it to look like a book and come with a booklet inside and the soundtrack, then you will be disappointed. Not in the movie, but in the packaging.

It's not clear if this is supposed to happen, or if the one we received just does not have a tight fit for the brush. The bristles are soft and flexible enough to reach into small crevices were dust may collect. I've also tested out between buttons on electronics and keys in the laptop. It's a neat little gadget,but the quality was not up to par.
B00000JCEC|4.0|Ringo's recording career lay fallow for a decade as drink and drugs dragged him down to the depths. Until he pulled himself out of his swoon as the 1980s closed. De-tox, wife Barbara, touring an oldies band and perhaps a little ole-time religion seemed to turn things around. Permanently. Of course, during the interval his following dwindled to some tens of thousands from the tens of millions of his Beatles and early post-Beatles years. No matter. It's not like he was desperate for cash. What he WAS desperate for, rather, was some song-writing partners who could help him generate new Ringo Starr material to anchor new Ringo Starr records. And indeed, that's what happened. Starr fans who tuned him out by the mid-1970s might want to consider retrospectively tuning him in again as of the 1990s. He made a heck-of-a-lot of terrific music in his 50s and 60s. It's a new Ringo sound, but being Ringo, it's still a hoot.<br /><br />In fact, each Beatle had immediate post-Beatles success, faded out at some point and then made a come-back. John was out-of-it for the second half of the 1970s. Paul kept producing during his slump but might as well have (and should have) taken the mid-1980s off. George DID take the mid-1980s off from recording and switched his focus to film. Not only did each former-Beatle experience fading out and coming back, each turned his back on Beatlesque/Beatlesworthy fare at some point, but later returned to it.<br /><br />On this album we find the first few nuggets that Ringo would hatch by way of the kind of Beatlesworthy contributions he would make to any CD-R/iPod collection that assembles the best of the Beatles' solo output into bona fide 1970-2010 Beatles album-sets. `Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go' and `After All These Years' make the grade. Onto Ringo bonus CD-Rs go `Weight of the World', `Golden Blunders' and `What Goes Around'--all delightful but serving a secondary Ringo persona that wasn't a Beatle. The cover of `Don't Be Cruel' goes onto a post-1960s Beatles covers set.<br /><br />And there would be much more, and better, coming down the pipe once Ringo truly hit his stride in the late 1990s.overs set.

B0045I3EJC|5.0|The idea of multiple universes and how each choice we make can lead to an entirely different life is something that has been brought up a number of times in the realm of science fiction.  It has even made its way into movies and television, most notably seen recently in JJ Abrams' Fringe TV series  [[ASIN:B001C4CI8U Fringe: The Complete First Season]](highly recommended, btw).<br /><br />This movie doesn't start out simple and lead up to something complex.  It plunges you right into the thick of it at the onset.  A very peculiar looking doctor with a bizarre \\"head tattoo\\" interviews the elderly subject, a man who we then discover is the focus of this movie, in various incarnations.  And so, we \\"begin\\" our journey into this life of his... there are moments from childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, in a somewhat general progression, but there's also some jumping back and forth.  It's a bit confusing at first...<br /><br />Just try to remember that you can't watch this movie and try to \\"understand\\" it all in a conventional way.  You simply have to let it flow before you... just take it as it comes.  It's the kind of thing where you'll have a sense of what this movie is really about towards the end of it.  But \\"end\\" is kind of a misnomer here.  Your traditional story has a concrete beginning and ending... this has neither.  It's more of an experience than a traditional story.<br /><br />I can't really say too much more about it... however, the key message that is delivered is phenomenal.  At least, I found it to be.  It's that although you will face tough choices in life, and be very indecisive about what choice or path to take, don't get caught up in that.  Make a choice.  And even if you begin to feel that the choice you made was the wrong one, think again.  There is no wrong choice.  Just different ones.  AND... we cannot know how the other choices would turn out anyway.  The most important thing is to make the most of the choices you HAVE made.  Live life to the fullest.  Do not lug around regret... for it has no benefit and is usually misguided.<br /><br />This movie appears to go in and out of stock.  As of this update, it's back in stock at a very good price.  I highly recommend getting it while you can.  :-)ret... for it has no benefit and is usually misguided.  This movie appears to go in and out of stock.

B004W5T3XO|5.0|I am really enjoying the Season 2 episodes that started in March! The writing is fresh, character development is vibrant and I especially liked how the writers brought in old faces from the Stargate family. After a somewhat lackluster Year 1 I finally have a reason to stick with the series and...it gets cancelled. Come on guys!  The \\"boy genius\\" is breaking out of his one-dimensional shell (and occasionally out of his red shirt). Rush is becoming human (thanks in part for the time he spent with his doctor friend). Greer and Camile's interaction helped beautifully add much needed dimensionality to their roles. The show's intelligent moral dilemmas are endearing me to Universe like vintage StarTrek-Next Generation episodes. In my humble opinion, good science fiction has always depended more on how we humans reflect on our own humanity rather than on the technology and gee whiz special effects. Well, I'm starting to see more of these qualities in SG-U. My hat is off to the writers, actors, special effects staff and everyone who is responsible for the show exuding such life and joy. I have laughed and cried watching these recent episodes, fist pumping all the way. Hallelujah!    Don't pull the plug. Give us more of THIS kind of programming and I'm willing to bet that you could again earn an audience faithful to the StarGate franchise.

We refrigeratored it for 6 hours, which is suggested, it was horrible.  On page 84 of the book she makes a statement about not steering someone wrong but she did.

B000069HJM|3.0|This much maligned Supertramp realease was the follow up to 1985's BROTHER WHERE YOU BOUND. It was the late 80s and there was either electronica or hair metal to choose from in the top 40. Supertramp is a progressive rock group from the 70s, and that kind of music was definitely not in vogue. This album is like nothing they put out before, and therefore fans hate it. On BROTHER they had a hit with Cannonball, which also enjoyed some success on the dance circuit. On this album it seems like they decided to incorporate some dance and electronica into their style. BROTHER's subject matter was dark and heavy. On FREE AS A BIRD we hear a much lighter sound and there is a return to lighter material in the lyrics. It seems like they were trying to reinvent themselves to keep up with the times and/or to go in a direction that may have been suggested by their record company after the success of BROTHER. In any case, this is an enjoyable album that grows on you with time. They revisit the sound of their seminal album BREAKFAST IN AMERICA on track 3 It Doesn't Matter, but it is not as immediate as anything on that album. There are several tracks that incorporate danceable rhythms and latin percussion, but it only works as a novelty variation of the Supertramp sound rather than a reinvention that could be marketed to the dance circuit that Cannonball enjoyed success on. Regardless or what the motivation was for their radical change in direction for this album, it is a good listen; albeit after a few listens more than their older albums took to take hold. This is more of a transition album for them. It sounds more like adult contemporary than pop/rock, a sure way to alienate a fan base. The later sound that they adopted for SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE and SLOW MOTION is audible here. Mark Hart from Crowded House replaced Roger Hodgson, but Rick Davies doesn't let him in on the fun. His presence is barely distinguishable and instead he becomes a bit player. The rest of the band is stellar as usual, but Hodgson is missed on the songwriting. If you are new to Supertramp, I recommend in order from best to least:    BREAKFAST IN AMERICA  CRIME OF THE CENTURY  CRISIS WHAT CRISIS?  BROTHER WHERE YOU BOUND  EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS  FAMOUS LAST WORDS    FREE AS A BIRD is not Supertramp in their most famous and effective incarnation but it is worth buying as a blend of adult contemporary, jazz and world music. Rick Davies is a master of the blues and of blending the mentioned styles. I did not expect to like this album as much as I did, but it made me wish (as with all Supertramp fans) that Roger Hodgson had never left.
B002VWNID6|2.0|Where to begin?  Hmm, the positive, as there's so little: there are some amusing action sequences and one-liners.  Sean Connery.  Marian's servant. And... not too much else.      Kevin Costner is Kevin Costner and talks in the most monotone voice that you just are begging for him to die already.  (It's not good when you're cheering for Robin Hood to die.)  He has a completely unnecessary (and supposedly body-doubled) nude scene which makes the romance between him and Marian that much more unappealing.      Maid Marian almost deserves Kevin, though.  Her character is horribly uneven.  Why does she give up all Ninja skills when she meets Robin Hood?  They should have had someone (the priest, the witch, the sheriff) knock her out to spare us her uselessness in the last fight.      Speaking of uselessness: Azeem- a pointless character.  I like Morgan Freeman, but his character was written with an agenda, to show the Christians are infidels and he is godly.  I get the point, but it was very heavy-handed (and one-sided) and out of place in this movie.  How many times does he have to say that he doesn't drink?  Did we really need the rivalry between him and the friar?  No.  Did we need him at all?  No- because the witch, who gives him purpose (as he has to kill her) is unnecessary.  On a side-note, why does he have to kill the witch twice?  How does she suddenly appear (un-stabbed) in the room?  How is Azeem magically healed at the wedding?  But let's not get bogged down with these trivialities.    The script suffers from so many convolutions and complications, none of which add anything to the story.  How many Darth Vaderesque scenes are we supposed to endure?  \\"George, I am your mother!\\" \\"NOOOOOOOO!\\"  \\"Robin, I am your half-brother!\\" \\"I have a brother.\\" <--Actual line, delivered in that same monotone voice; I had to laugh and cringe.  Yes, you have a brother, but it's Christian Slater, sorry!  Alan Rickman's sheriff is so over-the-top and adds yet another tone to this cacophony.  The directors (there must have been more than one, right?) have conflicting ideas about what this movie's supposed to be and where it's going.  It ends up being Braveheart (but without the brave and without the heart) and going nowhere.  [Just tell me Kevin Costner doesn't look like William Wallace in this movie.  Especially when he's giving all these speeches about freedom.]  ------------  Bottom line:  -Buy The Adventures of Robin Hood (Errol Flynn).  -Buy Disney's Robin Hood.  --Buy ANY Robin Hood! (except for perhaps the new Russell Crowe version which might suffer from trying to portray this light-hearted tale with realism and heaviness)    Just avoid buying this movie.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|Amy Chua's book it entertaining and thought provoking but for those who are using this book to judge her parenting skills apparently didn't get past the cover of the book.  This book is about her journey, her struggle, and ultimately her life.  Is she a model parent?  Heck no....but most people aren't.  You do the best you can and try to give your children the ability to fend for themselves and strive for greatness.  This book encapsulates her education about the human spirit by not just Lulu but also Sophia, the detriments to a child from pushing too hard, and the triumphs with your child when they overcome and suceed.  It's very well written and a fast enjoyable read.  There were times that I thought to myself..\\"geez, this woman is insane\\" and at other times I had to concur with one of her characters, \\"what might I have become if Amy Chua was my mother\\".  This book allows for insight into another culture and world that most Western parents never get to understand.  I applaud Mrs. Chua and certainly thing that some of her points about Western parently philosphy are completely valid.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|after reading some fellow reviewers thoughts and reviews on this book, i have no choice but to put my thoughts out there.    i have read and re-read Breaking Dawn. in my opinion, it is hands down the most dramatic, compelling and imaginative of the 4 books. my heart belongs to the twilight saga.    in breaking dawn, bella and edward do the following:  get married, go on honeymoon (consummate the marriage), get pregnant, have baby, face volturi. well, its not all that simple, but those are the basics in which stephanie meyer dives and twists and weaves and turns her magic.   at times, the descriptions are so vivid, i found myself physically tensed, anxious and at times, nauseated. and i dont mean any of that negatively. she writes the story with such tangible soul and passion about some grueling or simply just awesome experiences that me as a reader will never experience.    many people seem to be upset about the fact that bella is so loving and easily accepting of her pregnancy. i believe that those people have never been pregnant. the moment a mother knows of her unborn child, shes madly in love, and thank Goodness stephanie meyer portrayed that in bella.     another upset has been jacobs imprinting upon renesme. it has been referred to as \\"pedophilic\\". the idea of that is the most offensive thing i have ever heard. jacob explains very clearly the concept and boundaries of his imprinting.   the idea is that as the child is young, he will be her protector and love her with all his heart. he will love her as a child. as she gets older, their bond will strengthen and they will fall in love. and THEN he will love her romantically.     and then the complaints about the lack of violence and drama upon the volturis arrival. i for one am glad for the outcome. the conflict at the end of Eclipse was engough for me. to have another battle scene would have been repetative.    i believe that stephanie could not have dealt out a more perfect ending to the most powerful and intriguing story i have ever read. this book is perfection in its simplest form, a story of love, triumph and loyatly, which transports you to another time and space. if only ever book i could read would be as amazing as Breaking Dawn...    dont hesitate even for a second to read this installment.   its a staple in my collection and will be forever.   LOVE. IT.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|This film is long enough to require a pot of coffee and two bowls of rice. This is not to say that it is boring or slow. This film is a steady-paced unfolding of real life events concerning the Zodiac killer on the cusp of the sixth and seventh decades of the previous century.

The descriptions of all the pomp and circumstance of courtly/lordly/knightly dress, banners and manners slowed down the narrative.  But I know that many readers enjoy that showy romantic stuff.  It will be difficult to do the book justice on the big screen.  There are numerous characters that are painted so well the reader/listener wants to know what will become of them in the next volume.

Criticism of a film like this, or a book like Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine, tends to focus on 'good' or 'bad' based on how closely the film or book aligned with the reviewer's frame of reference and/or biases. I have more patience for those offering positive reviews because they tend to be closer to providing an accurate appraisal based on greater congruence with the values by which they apparently live. Those who tend to review such films and books negatively are inclined to dismiss the quality of the work with pronouncement about it's propagandistic nature or, worse, its socialist leanings! What almost all reviewers lack, though, is a frame of reference that transcends the limits of possessing a point of view that hasn't been put through its paces.          What the nay-sayers say about Inside Job, specifically, is consistent with the above generalization. What they NEVER say is that the film (or the book, etc.) got its facts wrong. They do so because our short-cut culture ensures that appealing to those who would dare to call capitalism into question, or who exercise their right to not believe in the god-myth, or who can prove that socialism is actually more congruent with their Christian dogma guarantees a critical mass of support from a public that values its lazy-but-comfortable intellectual patterns more than it does the stark realities of our world.  They think that by calling Inside Job propaganda, we'll be frightened away from its underlying truth, thereby perpetuating the systems that most assuredly benefit the reviewers who espouse such sentiments. And the sad fact of the matter is that they are correct: when accused of propagandizing or espousing socialistic values, we cower in fear of their disapproval.  Because, like them, most of us haven't done the hard work to espouse a belief that's balanced between conviction and rationality.       If Inside Job has a weakness, it is that it did not link up with Naomi Klein to place a stake in the heart of the socio-pathological myths about \\"free-market economics.\\" We have been led to believe that the \\"free market\\" is good because it is free. It is not. The price we've paid since adopting Milton Friedman's shock therapy economic insanity is now so abstractly large it no longer has meaning. We've adopted the negative pattern and it's become normal (which must mean that human nature values patterns even when their effects are catastrophic).  Inside Job makes that clear, but it could have stood to be 10-15 minutes longer by incorporating Klein's exposure of the folly of the \\"free\\" market.       About this reviewer: on an interpersonal level, I rarely if ever think myself better than another. On a systemic level, however, which is to say as a member of communities and of the larger society, I have no hesitation about stating that I have made myself better than those who, for whatever reason, perpetuate the massive and ever-growing inequities that exist between and among people. If you believe that neoliberalism and its offshoots have been good for humanity, then yes, I am emphatically better than you.     Failure to heed messages like Charles Ferguson's film and Naomi Klein's book is to stare into the sun and declare it nighttime. The facts are plain: after World War II and before Ronald Reagan's presidency, there was not a single economic collapse. Since deregulation was unleashed by Reagan and the acolytes who have followed him, there have been many. Deregulation, privatization, globalization, \\"free\\" markets do not work. Well, they work for a select few, but they have never worked in the way their proponents proclaim them to--as means of stabilizing markets and ensuring anything approaching equity of wealth-distribution. Am I cynical to believe this? NO. The facts have been staring us in the face for at least 30 years. The cynicism is inherent in the attempts of those who choose blindness to these facts, knowing that they'll get theirs, and to hell with the rest of us.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|One has to go back to 1990's \\"Rhythm of the Saints\\" to find a Paul Simon album as consistently rewarding and inspired as this one, and depending on one's tastes, one may have to go back to 1986's \\"Graceland\\" to find an album as strong as this one.  Yet while those two efforts found much of their success from Simon's inspired use of native African and South American rhythm and melodies, \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" finds Simon drawing from whatever influences he feels, with obvious traces of his previous work seeping in.<br />  The album kicks off with one of Simon's typical upbeat, lyrical tour-de forces.  Over a frantic acoustic groove and some gospel-tinged backing vocals, Simon- who's voice is in remarkable shape!- sings about getting ready for Christmas Day with quirky family details and a humanistic aside about the war in Iraq.  It has been a long while since a Simon album kicked off with such swagger and confidence, and from here on out it just gets better.  \\"The Afterlife\\" contains musical hints of South America as Simon sings about the bureaucracy of getting into heaven.  \\"Rewrite\\" is an engaging and deceptive telling of one man's existential crisis, while \\"Love and Hard Times\\" introduces strings and synthesizers into the mix, though in an experimental, slightly off kilter way.  Good stuff.<br />  Side two kicks off with another Simon lyrical tour-de-force, with elements of \\"Graceland\\" popping up.  The instrumental guitar piece \\"Amulet\\" and the straightforward \\"Questions for the Angels\\" hark back to Simon's pre-solo days and sound like they both would have fit perfectly on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\"<br />  Every song on this album is a keeper.  Simon's lyrics are stronger than ever- smart and clever without being merely clever; the instrumentation contains elements of other cultures without slipping into predictable \\"world music\\" cliches; and the flow of the album just works!  Uptempo, ballads, instrumentals- whether viewed as a collection of individual songs or as an unified album, \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" is a success!unified album, \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" is a success!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It was great! I was disappointed it did not contain a \\"storybook\\" inside the jacket. If you were not familiar with the story, you would not enjoy it as much.
B001MM28JG|1.0|This was probably the most boring movies I've ever seen. I could NOT believe all the positive reviews. The entire movie lacks a plot. I almost fell asleep halfway through. I recognized some of the actors from other films/shows (Tony Shalhoub from Monk, Alan Rickman from Harry Potter). Glad I saw this at a friend's house and didn't pay anything for it.
0316056863|1.0|I read this and did not laugh once. Then again, I haven't found any SNL alumni funny in the past 15 years. Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, Tina Fey, they're lost on me.   I grew up with Carlin, Pryor and the original SNL cast so I guess I'm spoiled when it comes to comedy.From Belushi to Sandler, that's like comparing an elephant to a fly.   I do like several new comics, Greg Giraldo was funny. I love Lisa Lampanelli. I like Jeff Ross, but the comedians that come out of Rock Center these days just bore me.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|\\"Wasting Light\\" is the kind of all-out rock album that kicks the listener in the face from start to finish. In an era where listeners have begun to download select songs and ignore full album releases, \\"Wasting Light\\" by the Foos is one that just straight up impresses all the way through. My favorites are \\"Bridge Burning,\\" \\"Arlandria\\" and \\"Walk,\\" but every one of the 11 songs on the album is uniquely catchy but still packs enough raw rock punch to please just about anyone with an ear for fun rock music.    Dave Grohl and company have REALLY set the bar high on this one. Kudos, boys. After several years, I can finally say I have a new favorite album again.    Buy \\"Wasting Light,\\" you won't be disappointed! I promise.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|When I get this CD on release date, it was definitely....different.  It didn't sound much like his previous CDs that I had listened to hundred's of times.     But, after a few months, I can definitely say this CD grows on you.  A lot of things in it I didn't appreciate on a first listening really come to life.      Give the CD a chance if you're a \\"Grobanite\\" and if you're new to Josh Groban, you will fall in love with his music.
B0046W1692|5.0|Me gusta el CD. El primer sencillo 'Lluvia al Corazon' dejo mucho que desear, pero este CD tiene muy buenas canciones.  Tienes 2 canciones EXCELENTES, nuevas y diferentes de Maná: 'El Dragon' y 'El Espejo'.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|You are bound to get more than a few laughs out of this book, and you'll learn a little something about comedy and Tina Fey.  If you enjoy Tina and Second City style comedy, you'll love this book.
B004GYY714|5.0|This  great, I can listen to my sports teams while on the road no matter where I am. Awesome app and there want any lagging at all.
B002QW7ALM|1.0|What is with all the good reviews for this movie?  If people are willing to award 5 stars for such lacklustre rubbish, the studios have no incentive to up their game when it comes to producing and releasing good intelligent sci-fi films.  Now, I'm a big sci-fi fan - always have been of both novels and movies - some of my all time favourite films like the first two Aliens or Bladerunner are science fiction films, so when films like Pandorum are released it really annoys me - especially when you can see that there was a potential to make an interesting and exciting film.    However, what annoys me even more is the huge positive reaction such a film seems able to generate on these pages.    People should re-calibrate their expectations a bit - there is a mine of fantastic sci-fi literature that has barely been touched - novels with much to say on the human condition or society in general or perhaps just a mind-bendingly brilliantly original idea. Pandorum falls so short of these ideals it's embarrassing - most of the film consists of man getting chased down dark corridors by mindless zombies while other man sits in chair with headphones shouting \\"what's happening\\" over and over again.    If that's your idea of a 5 star film I truly pity you
B00003CXRM|1.0|I'm not a movie buff... and usually like some movies that the critics hate... but THIS movie was sooooo boring boring boring boring...  I threw it out rather than burden anyone else with this waste of time.
B000FC1MOQ|4.0|Is non- fiction ever 100 percent true?  No matter.  This is a good read.  The story moved and kept my interest...that is enough for this reader.
0446691437|5.0|I thought this might just be about art and overcoming resistance to being creative. It's really about overcoming resistance in all its forms. What really spoke to me is the idea that we are destined to do something and most people have a pretty good idea of what it is. Then comes resistance and all the messages of why we cannot do the thing we want (and Pressman says, we need) to do. He explains that after we overcome resistance the universe opens up to support us.<br /><br />I was stuck with some major decisions and this book was highly recommended. I not only read it, but I put the spoken version in my car and kept playing it until I got it. I am now doing what I believe I was supposed to be doing and with little surprise, it's working very well.<br /><br />Pressman confirmed what I already believed but was having a hard time remembering. This book was highly effective in reminding me to move forward, trust myself, and to trust the universe.  Is the book very short and simple? Yes, and some people may need more words and ideas. For me, this was the right book, the right size, the right ideas, and came along at just the right time.<br /><br />I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I'm going to keep this simple. This is amazingly beautiful, deep music. There is nothing else out there these days with the depth of melody, harmony and lyrics on this album. The craft on this is amazing, and the recording, mixing, and production is without compare. (I'm listening to a real CD on a good system.)    After all, this is Paul Simon.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|The original Tron movie is one of my all-time most favorite movies ever. I saw the original Tron movie on the big screen back in 1982 and I was really wowed by it. Here was a movie about a young computer programmer and video game designer named Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who gets trapped inside of a computer world and must survive against his very own creations. How cool is that for a movie storyline? Plus, I could really relate to this movie because back in those days I used to go to the video game arcade all of the time. In fact, in the same shopping center where I first saw Tron, there was also a video game parlor located there named Time Zone Arcade where I spent a lot of Friday evenings playing the newest video games before going to see the latest movies.  Even now, 28 years later at the theater where I watched Tron:Legacy this last December, I played Ms. Pac Man, and Galaga in the theaters game section just before seeing the movie. It was like Deja Vu. Anyway, I absolutely loved the new Tron: Legacy movie. It was everything that the first movie was and so much more.<br /><br />To think that some 28 odd years later after the release of the first Tron and here I was seeing a big-budget sequel on the big screen featuring the return of two of its original stars, Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner and, well...Wow, I practically had to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming. I never would have thought that there would ever be a sequel made to this movie in my wildest dreams. During its theater run I managed to see Tron: Legacy 4 times, twice in 3D, and twice the regular version, and I would have seen it at least a couple more times if I could have. This movie is awesome and really entertains you. It is films such as this one that I go to movie theaters for in the first place, to see big, epic, larger-than-life action adventure movies loaded with wild and interesting characters, great action sequences, spectacular special effects, and lots of fun, and this movie delivered all of that and more in Spades.<br /><br />The only negative that I can give the film is that I did not think the 3D looked all that impressive. Of course I only saw this movie in a regular theater, I did not see it in IMAX, which I have heard the 3D looked much better in IMAX. But I digress, this review is not about the 3D Blu-Ray DVD, only the standard Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack of which I own. EDIT: As of 12-17-2011 I am now the proud owner of the 3D Blu ray version of the film and let me tell you, it looks absolutely stunning! I really was surprised at how so much better the 3D in this movie looks at home. If you are considering obtaining the 3D version of this film, do not hesitate. It looks very impressive.<br /><br />But, besides all of that, this movie still rocks whether viewed in 3D or not. All I can say is if you enjoy big epic Sci Fi action adventure movies as much as I do then you should definitely see this film. Trust me, they do not get much bigger or more epic than this.red all of that and more in Spades.<br /><br />The only negative that I can give the film is that I did not think the 3D looked all that impressive.

B00159UUZA|5.0|Such a funny story for babies and young children. It's a classic childhood favorite of mine! I love sharing this book with my friends at their baby showers.
B004FN7ZOC|4.0|In Norse Mythology, Surtur was a giant who carried a flaming sword to do battle against the god Freyr. The carnage of the fight was said to have caused waves of flames to engulf the earth. It's a perfect descriptor of Surtur Rising, the eighth album from Swedish melodic metal masters Amon Amarth. For those of you familiar with Amon Amarth, you should know what to expect already.<br /><br />For those who don't, you can expect to hear intense metal epics illustrating tales of Norse gods, hailing the glory of victory while also depicting the agony of defeat and death. They're hardly the first band to do this, but they're doing it about as well as anybody today.<br /><br />Musically, the band plays at a level of intensity rarely heard - the power and heaviness delivered by guitarists Johan S&ouml;derberg and Olavi Mikkonen will scorch you like flames being shot through a blast furnace. There are so many fast double bass parts here that you'll swear drummer Fredrik Andersson must have the meatiest calf muscles in all of Sweden.<br /><br />Vocalist Johan Hegg frankly doesn't have the greatest range. He can muster about three styles - deep growls, deeper growls, and a higher pitched scream. This makes it hard for him to play into the band's melodic style, but he is able to pull off jaw dropping choruses in \\"War of the Gods\\" and \\"Destroyer of the Universe.\\"<br /><br />What Hegg excels at, however, is pulling off the image of tough guy Norse/Viking warrior. If your band expects to tell the story of 13th century mythological epics, you've got to have the right guy behind the mic to do it.<br /><br />Surtur Rising carries on the theme of most Amon Amarth albums by alluding to Norse mythology, but they have many tunes that speak in more general terms. \\"Slaves of Fear\\" attacks the corrupting hold of religion while \\"Live Without Regrets\\" trumpets the never ending bravado of warriors off to battle.<br /><br />\\"The Last Stand of Frej is perhaps the most eloquent portrait of the creedo of battle - Frej is facing a mighty foe he knows he has no chance of beating, but the rules of honor in combat prevent him from surrender and dictate that he must stand tall to the end.<br /><br />On previous records, Amon Amarth have been known for brandishing more of a classical heavy metal feel, but Surtur Rising steps away from that a bit to favor more of a straight ahead metal approach. But there's some good diversity on this record. There is some distinct Dark Tranquility influence here, most notably on \\"Live Without Regrets\\" and \\"For Victory or Death.\\"<br /><br />The obvious highlights are the raging opener \\"War of the Gods\\" and the all out assault of \\"Destroyer of the Universe,\\" undoubtedly the heaviest song on the record.<br /><br />It's a shame that the rest of the album isn't really able to recapture the intensity that these two songs had. If they had managed to do that for the entire album, or even for half the songs, Surutr Rising might have been an album for the ages. As it stands, though, Amon Amarth has still managed to mount an early challenge for metal album of the year.<br /><br />Give Surtur Rising a few spins and you'll soon be swinging your flaming sword with such precision that you'll drive fear into the steely heart of Freyr himself.ows he has no chance of beating, but the rules of honor in combat prevent him from surrender and dictate that he must stand tall to the end.
